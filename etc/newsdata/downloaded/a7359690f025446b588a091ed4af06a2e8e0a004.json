(Michael Ainsworth/Associated Press)\n\nThe injuries are piling up, and bye weeks begin this weekend as the NFL reaches Week 4. Whether your fantasy team is undefeated or looking for that first victory, your decisions likely will get more complicated this week.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m here to provide assistance.\n\nWe\u2019ve combed the far reaches of the Internet and culled only the choicest fantasy tips and advice. Below you\u2019ll find easily digestible nuggets addressing some of the critical situations fantasy owners will face from week to week.\n\nDig in. And dominate.\n\nBye weeks: 49ers, Jets.\n\n[Week 4 fantasy football rankings]\n\nSleepers\n\nAdam Humphries, WR, Titans: Ideally, it would be nice to see Humphries have another nice week before inserting him into the lineup. Tennessee\u2019s offseason acquisition finally made his presence felt, serving as the lone bright spot in the team\u2019s Week 3 loss. That said, if ever there were a good situation to start Humphries, this week might be it when the Titans travel to Atlanta. The Falcons are nothing special defensively, and Humphries has a chance to duplicate his production from a week ago. He\u2019s owned in just 22 percent of ESPN leagues. Even if he can\u2019t be used this week, he offers upside and should be on a roster.\n\nPreston Williams, WR, Dolphins: Williams has quietly increased his targets, from five in Week 1 to six in Week 2 and then 12 in a Week 3 blowout loss to the Cowboys. Miami hosts the Chargers this weekend, and no matter the outcome, Williams should continue to be productive. Williams is available in nearly 97 percent of ESPN leagues, and could be a great streaming pick come Sunday. For traditional leagues, if you have a roster spot available, Williams should at least be a consideration as a reserve.\n\nFringe Starters\n\nTodd Gurley, RB, Rams: Let\u2019s make it clear: No one should bench Gurley this week in a promising matchup against the Buccaneers. But let\u2019s also be clear: This isn\u2019t the Todd Gurley we\u2019ve been looking for. In a key matchup last October against the Packers, Gurley was in top form, rushing 25 times for 114 yards while catching six passes for 81 yards and a touchdown. Thirty-one touches! Since that game, he\u2019s rarely come close to that number. His high this season is 19 touches in Week 2, and he has all of six targets in the passing game. Gone is the patented screen pass the Rams used to spring Gurley on a potential big play. He hasn\u2019t cracked 100 yards in any game and has just one score. Even for owners that had Gurley fall to them in drafts, this production leaves you wanting more. His scoring is becoming contingent on getting in the end zone. In Week 4, expect perhaps 90 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown, but going forward, Gurley\u2019s limited snap count is a concern.\n\nCourtland Sutton, WR, Broncos: Sutton has been solid in a Denver offense that\u2019s struggling. He\u2019s received no fewer than seven targets in each game, tallying 120 yards in the season opener. The Broncos are at home against a tough Jacksonville defense, and it\u2019s unclear if the Jaguars will have cornerback Jalen Ramsey. Jacksonville allowed Humphries to haul in six receptions for 93 yards in Week 3. That gives Sutton owners hope. While the Denver wideout was limited to 40 yards in a Week 2 matchup against the Bears, he bounced back in Week 3 with five receptions for 87 yards against another tough defense in the Packers. It\u2019s difficult to see Sutton competing for a WR2 spot unless he\u2019s a stopgap fill-in, but he\u2019s a potential flex play.\n\nTampa Bay RBs: The fringe of the fringe: That\u2019s probably the best description when it comes to the combination of Peyton Barber and Ronald Jones II. There has been absolutely no rhyme or reason to the happenings in the Buccaneers\u2019 backfield. Barber has been the \u201cstarter\u201d each week, but hasn\u2019t been impressive. Coach Bruce Arians has consistently said he would just ride the hot hand when it came to his tailback. Jones had the better game in Week 1; Barber in Week 2, then Jones in Week 3. I pity the owner that has to contemplate playing either player, but with injuries and the beginning of bye weeks, owners might not have many options. Barber and Jones both have their work cut out for them in Week 4 when Tampa Bay hosts the Los Angeles Rams. This is a pretty easy decision unless you are in dire need: Look elsewhere. Long term, Jones is showing flashes and could come in handy as the season progresses.\n\n[Fantasy football start/sit Week 4: Get Jacoby Brissett and Demarcus Robinson into your lineup]\n\nInjury Decisions\n\nSaquon Barkley, RB, Giants: By now, you\u2019re probably aware that Barkley suffered a high-ankle sprain and is out four to eight weeks. Wayne Gallman stands to inherit those touches in the New York backfield.\n\nT.Y. Hilton, WR, Colts: Hilton left in the second quarter of the Colts\u2019 Week 3 win. Having aggravated his quad injury, Hilton is questionable heading into an appealing matchup against the Raiders. The Colts might opt to sit him so he can get more recovery time. Hilton owners should have a backup plan for Week 4. Hilton did not practice Friday, which is usually not a good sign. That said, he went through a similar routine during the 2018 season and continued to play. The good news is, because the Colts are playing at 1 p.m. Eastern time, you will be able to swap Hilton out of the lineup for someone else.\n\nDeSean Jackson, WR, Eagles: Given the short week as Philadelphia plays on Thursday night, Jackson is expected to be out again as he continues to recover from an abdomen injury.\n\nJustin Jackson, RB, Chargers: Austin Ekeler owners, this may be Ekeler\u2019s final hurrah as the do-it-all tailback. With Melvin Gordon returning and Jackson out in Week 4 with a calf injury, Ekeler will see plenty of work in a terrific matchup against the Dolphins.\n\nCam Newton, QB, Panthers: Newton is dealing with a Lisfranc injury and is out for Week 4 and beyond. Kyle Allen will continue to start in his place.\n\nJordan Reed, TE, Redskins: Reed continues to deal with a concussion and his timeline for returning is unclear.\n\nDevin Singletary, RB, Bills: Singletary returned to practice in a limited capacity, participating in drills Thursday and Friday. He is listed as questionable. The consensus seems to be that he could see fewer snaps. He\u2019s still on the mend, which makes the decision tough. Singletary had largely proven he could be productive on those limited touches. If New England were to be comfortably ahead, it\u2019s hard to know if that would result in more touches in garbage time for Singletary, or possibly more rest on the bench if the game is out of reach.\n\nMike Williams, WR, Chargers: Williams was banged up entering Week 3 and didn\u2019t provide much. Now his back injury is forcing him to miss Los Angeles\u2019s weekend matchup at Miami.\n\nRead more:\n\nHow to replace Saquon Barkley in your fantasy football lineup\n\nThe NFL\u2019s search for the next Sean McVay has created a new role: Head Coach of the Defense\n\nThe Dolphins could be the worst team in NFL history\n\nNFL power rankings Week 4: Cowboys and Packers are on the heels of the Rams for NFC supremacy\n\nJosh Norman is being picked on by opponents, and it\u2019s hurting the Redskins\n\nAt 0-3, it\u2019s time to ask: What is this Redskins season even about?\n\nRichie Incognito admits to \u2018a lot of crazy stuff in my past\u2019 but swears he\u2019s \u2018okay\u2019 now\n\nCam Newton\u2019s foot injury reportedly is much more severe than originally thought\n\nThe Denver Broncos are in a \u2018world of suck.\u2019 Here\u2019s why.\n\nJalen Ramsey Jaguars trade speculation, explained: The cornerback is sick (and tired) of Jacksonville", "description": "", "authors": ["John Romero", "Multiplatform Editor", "Fantasy Football Reporter", "September At Pm", "John Arrived At The Washington Post In With A Diverse Skill Set That Continues To Grow.
