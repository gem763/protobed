He hoped to meet the unique needs of a blind woman in Hawaii by breeding a hypoallergenic service dog.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThirty years after the birth of Sultan, the first labradoodle, the breed has become one of the world\u2019s most popular. But the breed has been an overwhelming success for all the wrong reasons, according to their creator.\n\n\u201cI opened a Pandora\u2019s box and released a Frankenstein monster,\u201d Conron told the \"Sum of All Parts\" podcast. \"I released the reason for these unethical, ruthless people to breed these dogs and sell them for big bucks. That\u2019s my big regret.\u201d\n\nThe labradoodle\u2019s instant popularity gave rise to the practice of crossbreeding animals for huge profits. Designer dogs routinely fetch price tags well above those of their purebred parents. Labradoodle puppies from reputable sellers, for example, can easily cost over $2,500 before the cost of care and grooming come into play. Conron blames himself for the controversial sensation.\n\nUpon its introduction to the public, the labradoodle became famous for its appearance and playfulness instead of its service potential. They are highly intelligent, feature non-shedding coats, and are available in a variety of colors and sizes. They became the first \u201cdesigner dog\u201d \u2013 a term used to describe any dog crossed between two purebred parents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLabradoodles are known to suffer from degenerative hip and elbow diseases, epilepsy, and several other inherited conditions thanks to their crossbred lineage and the resulting small gene pool. Conron does appreciate that healthy and happy labradoodles can be wonderful companions just like he envisioned thirty years ago. However, he warned, \u201cthey are few and far between.\u201d\n\nOther designer dog breeds, including the puggle, goldendoodle and cockapoo, face similar hereditary health problems and breeding practice controversies despite their massive popularity as both companions and fashion statements.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Wally Conron, who first bred the Labradoodle in 1988, regrets that his creation gave rise to the \"designer dog.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/02/0/0/dog-eating-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
