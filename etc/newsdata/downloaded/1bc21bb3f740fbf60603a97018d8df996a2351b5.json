Also because he\u2019s not blaming it on tweets, Trump or tariffs.\n\nThe chief U.S. economist for Societe Generale also stands out because he\u2019s just won MarketWatch\u2019s Forecaster of the Month contest, which we designed to recognize the most accurate U.S. economic forecasters.\n\nGallagher\u2019s recession story is a relatively simple one: U.S. recessions are typically preceded by an erosion in corporate profit margins, or profit per dollar of revenue. Costs generally rise near the end of the cycle while sales flatten out.\n\nProfit margins for U.S. nonfinancial corporations peaked in 2015 at 15.2% of gross value added, and have fallen to 10.9% in the latest quarter.\n\nCorporations are earning about 11 cents for every dollar of value added.\n\nGallagher has been warning about a slow squeeze on profits since 2016.\n\nCost-cutting\n\nSince few corporations have any pricing power, the only way for managers to defend their margins against higher labor costs is to turn defensive, focusing on cost-cutting instead of growth. Once companies begin to reduce investment and payrolls, it\u2019s only a matter of time before consumer spending stalls.\n\nOddly perhaps, one way corporations could avoid narrowing margins would be to aggressively invest in productivity-enhancing technologies. That isn\u2019t happening. Although investments in R&D and software are up, capital spending on structures and equipment is quite weak.\n\n\u201cThe erosion in margins is the key to business-cycle dynamics,\u201d Gallagher said in an interview. If the U.S. does enter a recession in 2020, \u201chistory is very likely to view it as a trade-war recession,\u201d he wrote early in 2018. But trade tensions are only the catalyst, not the main cause, he says.\n\nWhen companies\u2019 margins are fat, they are able to roll with the punches. But when profits are thin, managers cut costs at the first sign of danger.\n\n\u201cWith a backdrop of weak profit expectations, the trade uncertainty poses serious challenges for business planning,\u201d Gallagher wrote in a note to clients in August. \u201cIn an environment of much stronger profit margins, the same trade uncertainty would likely pose less of a deterrent.\u201d\n\nMild recession\n\nGallagher expects the recession to be fairly mild. Aside from a need to correct excessive leverage in some sectors of corporate debt, he sees few other imbalances.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the Fed could cut interest rates aggressively enough to prevent an outright recession. Although lower rates won\u2019t do much to resolve the underlying erosion of profit margins, they would ease the debt service burden on many overleveraged companies and consumers.\n\nHe thinks the Fed will cut rates one more time this year (mostly likely at the end of this month) and then four times early in 2020 as the recession hits.\n\nStephen Gallagher\u2019s forecast Number as reported* ISM 52.0% 49.1% Nonfarm payrolls 142,000 130,000 Trade deficit -$52.8 billion -$54.0 billion Retail sales 0.2% 0.4% Industrial production 0.4% 0.6% Consumer price index 0.1% 0.1% Housing starts 1.235 million 1.364 million Durable goods orders -0.3% 0.2% Consumer confidence index 130.5 125.1 New home sales 685,000 713,000 *Subject to revisions\n\nGallagher\u2019s victory in the August forecasting contest was his fourth overall. He earned the award with accurate forecasts on six of the 10 indicators we track: the consumer price index, nonfarm payrolls, new home sales, consumer confidence index, durable goods orders and industrial production.\n\nThe runners-up in the September contest were Robert Brusca of Fact and Opinion Economics, Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics, Jim O\u2019Sullivan of High Frequency Economics, and Richard Moody of Regions Financial.\n\nThe MarketWatch median consensus published in our Economic Calendar includes the predictions of the 15 forecasters who have earned the most points in our contest over the past 12 months, plus the forecast of the most recent winner of the monthly contest.\n\nThe economists in our consensus forecast are: Ryan Sweet of Moody\u2019s Analytics, Christophe Barraud of Market Securities, Jim O\u2019Sullivan of High Frequency Economics, Richard Moody of Regions Financial, Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macro, Michelle Girard\u2019s team at NatWest Markets, Seth Carpenter\u2019s team at UBS, Andrew Hollenhorst of Citigroup, Lou Crandall of Wrightson ICAP, Stephen Stanley of Amherst Pierpont Securities, Michael Feroli of J.P.
