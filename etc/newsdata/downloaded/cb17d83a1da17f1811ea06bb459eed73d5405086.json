The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to $255.1 at one point, and dropping to the lows of $206.7. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price.

Not the best news for investors looking to buy! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Paycom Software\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future.
