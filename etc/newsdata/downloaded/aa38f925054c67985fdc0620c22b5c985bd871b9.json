That includes past cases as well. Community service, fines, yes. But prison time, no. My heart goes out to Felicity, Bill Macy and their family,' the actor said in a tweet Wednesday.\n\nThis comes on the same day that actress Felicity Huffman officially started her 14-day federal prison sentence at 'Club Fed' for her role in the bribery scandal.\n\nAlec Baldwin weighed in on the college admissions scandal in a tweet Wednesday saying those found guilty should not serve jail time\n\n'Community service, fines, yes. But prison time, no,' he wrote, adding that his 'heart goes out to' Felicity Huffman and William H Macy\n\nHuffman, 56, surrendered to authorities on Tuesday at the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, California. She's pictured with husband William H Macy leaving Boston court\n\nBaldwin was immediately hit with backlash as Twitter users claimed his take on the matter was skewed by his own wealth and one that would let the rich off easy.\n\nSeveral Twitter users pointed to the disparities between Huffman's sentence and that of Tanya McDowell, the black mother who went to prison for enrolling her five-year-old son in the wrong school district.\n\n'While I agree with the general sentiment, the fact remains that privileged individuals like Lori [Loughling] and Felicity are treated differently by the law. And until we reach a bit of equity, I'm 100% ok with them serving time,' one Twitter user wrote and then shared an article about McDowell's case.\n\nAnother woman on Twitter responded to Baldwin saying: 'White collar crime is still crime. If a black woman can get 5 yrs for unknowingly voting as a felon, Ms Huffman will survive her weeks in detention for fraud which will later have zero affect on her future income or life except to be an embarrassing misstep of her past.'\n\nBaldwin was quick to respond to the critics, saying: 'But the woman you refer to should not have gone to prison either. Are you suggesting that Huffman\u2019s case is a form of reparation?'\n\nSeveral Twitter users pointed to the disparities between Huffman's sentence and that of Tanya McDowell, the black mother who went to prison for enrolling her five-year-old son in the wrong school district\n\nOthers online scoffed at Baldwin's claim that those charged in the scandal should be ordered to pay a fine or do community service in stead of serve jail time, but he responded defending his stance\n\nOthers scoffed at Baldwin's claim that those charged in the scandal should be ordered to pay a fine or do community service instead of serve jail time.\n\n'So the punishment for using their wealth to gain advantage of the less fortunate, should be using their wealth to avoid actual punishment like the less fortunate would have to face???' another Twitter user responded.\n\n'Fines. Seriously??? When do fines punish the wealthy?' another said.\n\n'This opinion seems tone deaf. If they can afford hundreds of thousands of $$ to get their kids in, how will a \"fine\" be a deterrent? Even the current risk of jail WASN'T,' another added.\n\nBaldwin, again, defended his stance, writing: 'Community service is better. The demonization of wealth in this country is mind blowing. A country built on both freedoms and commerce.\n\n'Now, all success is scrutinized. Merely to succeed, especially financially, invites scrutiny, judgment, abuse.'\n\nHuffman and Alec Baldwin spoke together onstage at the 16th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards on January 23, 2010\n\nBaldwin was pictured speaking with the couple in 2010 and defended them in a tweet Wednesday\n\nHuffman was sentenced to two weeks in prison on September 13 after she pleaded guilty to paying a $15,000 bribe to inflate her daughter's SAT scores.\n\nShe was also fined $30,000 and given a year of supervised release plus 250 hours of community service.\n\nThe 56-year-old actress surrendered to authorities on Tuesday at the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, about 30 miles southeast of Oakland, according to a spokeswoman.\n\nHuffman - aka inmate No. 77806-112 - is sharing a room and open toilet with three other inmates.\n\nBut despite the situation being a far cry from her usual lavish lifestyle, the prison where Huffman is being held has been nicknamed 'Chateau Dublin' and was once listed as one of America's 10 cushiest prisons.\n\nThe minimum-security women's prison, which is known to locals as 'Club Fed', has an ocean breeze and floor to ceiling windows that don't have bars.", "description": "Alec Baldwin weighed in on the college admissions scandal in a tweet Wednesday saying those found guilty should not serve jail time and offering his sympathy to Felicity Huffman and family.", "authors": ["Kayla Brantley For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/17/19797452-0-image-a-39_1571244193029.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
