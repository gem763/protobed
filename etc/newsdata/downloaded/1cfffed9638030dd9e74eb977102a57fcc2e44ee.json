Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) called it a \"grave mistake,\" while Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) called it a \"disaster\" and predicted what we can now expect in the region.\n\n* Ensures ISIS comeback.\n\n* Forces Kurds to align with Assad and Iran.\n\n* Destroys Turkey\u2019s relationship with U.S. Congress.\n\n* Will be a stain on America\u2019s honor for abandoning the Kurds. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 7, 2019\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) used it as another opportunity to instruct the president to stop taking cues from Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY).\n\nOnce again @realDonaldTrump uses Rand Paul\u2019s \u201cendless wars\u201d talking points as he orders America to once again abandon our friends and give Russia & Iran exactly what they want. This is wrong. #Syria \u2014 Adam Kinzinger (@RepKinzinger) October 7, 2019\n\nKinzinger, who served as a pilot in the Air Force, has shared his frustrations with Sen. Paul and his anti-war mentality before. In a Fox News Radio interview back in January, Kinzinger criticized Paul's foreign policy by calling him \"a very weak person.\"\n\nThe decision to fight terrorism is not one we make that is made for us the decision we have is where do we fight terrorism. And when Rand Paul, who wants to retreat from Afghanistan, retreat from Syria, something will fill that vacuum and it is chaos and terror that comes along. So he is absolutely wrong on this and as you mentioned his is just and it's a legitimate philosophy of isolationism, I don't I don't begrudge somebody that has a different philosophy but to pretend like that is Republicanism and that is strength is completely incorrect.\n\nThe same goes for the more hawkish Republican representative Liz Cheney. Last month, after reports that Trump had planned to meet with the Taliban at Camp David for peace talks and Sen. Paul supported it, she accused him of prioritizing terrorists before Americans.\n\nIf the president proceeds with his plan to remove U.S. troops from Syria, Sen. Graham pledged to introduce a Senate resolution opposing it and asking for reversal of this decision.\n\nHe expects it will receive \"strong bipartisan support.\"", "description": ".10/07/2019 15:46:22PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson", "Julio Rosas", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/d3689da9-e0cb-4f52-9342-90200a00a2b4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
