We are not against anybody,' said Eduardo Elizalde, a veteran with 40 years behind the wheel of Mexico City cabs.\n\n'But just as we have to pay taxes and pass exams, so should the apps.'\n\nTaxi drivers blocked Mexico City's major avenues and its airport on Monday to protest ride-hailing apps such as Uber\n\nMedallion cab drivers called for an even playing field from government officials in regards to licensing, tax, inspections and testing.\n\nTaxi drivers symbolically burn photo copies of their license plates to protest the apps in Mexico City\n\nThe Mexican capital, a city of 9 million people, has around 140,000 medallion cabs, and probably that many ride-hailing cars and gypsy cabs.\n\nThe arrival of new entrants such as Chinese app Didi and Spanish app Cabify have swelled the ranks of app drivers and increased the concerns of metered taxi drivers worried over their business.\n\nDeputy Interior Secretary Ricardo Peralta and \u00c1ngel Morales of a national taxi group said at a news conference Monday that agreements had been reached for the government to consult with experts on the legality of the apps and in return for cab drivers to adopt new technology and refrain from blocking roads in the future.\n\nDrivers also reportedly vowed to improve and modernize their service.\n\nA cab driver wrote on the back of his car, 'I support my family. Foreign applications got to go'\n\nMetered taxi drivers called for motorists operating under ride-share apps to be subject to the same regulations as metered cabs\n\nHundreds of taxi drivers gathered around the Angel of Independence monument to protest ride-sharing apps\n\nBeyond the convenience of being able to hail rides with their phones, many users say the apps are a safer and a more pleasant alternative to street cabs.\n\nAccording to Mexican outlet Milenio, Mexico City mayor Claudia Sheinbaum downplayed the presence of the protesters, saying that barely 0.04 percent of taxi drivers protested while 99.6 percent backed the government's push to confront corrupt practices carried out by some metered cab companies.\n\nSheinbaum said the small fraction of upset drivers were just looking to complain about the strict measures that regulators have imposed, including making sure each taxi license plate corresponds to the driver operating the vehicle.\n\n'The city is open to dialogue but let it be clear: the fight against corruption is not negotiable, we will not return to opaque practices that benefit a few and that affect the majority of taxi drivers and users,' Sheinbaum said.\n\n'The city wants rights taxis and safe taxis and what we do not want is corruption.'\n\nMetered taxi drivers demonstrated against the influx of foreign ride-share apps in Mexico City\n\nPeralta apologized to inconvenienced residents and said that 'desperation clouded our judgment' after three months of talks failed to yield progress.\n\nBy evening, hundreds of cars that had surrounded the capital's Independence Monument since the morning had melted away into the city.\n\nAuthorities and drivers will continue talks next week, Peralta said.\n\n'If the government does not come through, we will return to the streets,' said Roberto Ver\u00f3nica, a driver from the nearby city of Toluca in the State of Mexico.", "description": "Medallion taxi drivers went on strike Monday, blocking major streets and two airport terminal in protest of growing presence of foreign ride-sharing apps in Mexico City.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Adry Torres For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/15/19445166-0-image-a-6_1570543634367.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
