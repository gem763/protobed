Elizabeth Warren, on the stage and answering questions about her visions of health care, slipped in a rather significant \u2014 and somber \u2014 remark about the rich in this country that goes to the heart of socialist delusion. She said, in essence: the rich don\u2019t work.\n\nThe rich don\u2019t work hard.\n\nThe rich are basically lazy and entitled, the do-nothing class who take, take, take from the poor, poor, poor.\n\nApparently, she forgot to read her own bank statement today. \u2018Cause Warren, to put it bluntly, ain\u2019t exactly poverty stricken.\n\nAnyhow, from the stage, she said: In order to pay for insurance for all, \u201ccosts are going to go up for the wealthier, costs are going to go up for the corporations,\u201d and \u201ccosts are going to go down for the hard working individuals.\u201d\n\nAs if the wealthy aren\u2019t hard working.\n\nAs if the wealthy simply sit on their butts day in and day out, thumbing through the piles of cash they grab from the backs of the \u2014 her words \u2014 \u201chard working individuals.\u201d\n\nThis is the root of the socialist ill \u2014 envy. Pitting the haves versus the have-nots.\n\nAnd in America, fact is, the haves have because, for the most part, they\u2019ve worked for it. It\u2019s an injustice and a face slap to deem the wealthy as underserving of their wealth, simply because they\u2019re wealthy.\n\nAmerica is a land of opportunity, for all.\n\nAmerica offers a chance at prosperity and freedom and economic wealth, for all.\n\nAnd nobody should know that better than Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\u201cHow Elizabeth Warren Built a $12 Million Fortune,\u201d ran one recent Forbes headline.\n\n\u201cWhat is Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Net Worth? Elizabeth Warren has earned a great deal of wealth as law professor and as a politician,\u201d TheStreet reported, in July.\n\nHow much?\n\n\u201c[S]he and her husband, Bruce Mann, have amassed a formidable financial fortune, placing her well within the 1% of highest-earning Americans,\u201d TheStreet goes on to report.\n\nThat\u2019s interesting. Yes?\n\nWhen Warren talks about taking from the rich and giving to the poor \u2014 from taking from the fat, lazy, entitled rich and giving to the poor, downtrodden, hard-working poor \u2014 she neglects to look at herself.\n\nThat\u2019s hypocritical.\n\nBut then again, that\u2019s how socialism always goes.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
