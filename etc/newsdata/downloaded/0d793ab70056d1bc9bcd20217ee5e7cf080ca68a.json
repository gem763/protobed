This can often mean postponing income or accelerating deductions to shift tax burdens to a later year. It could also involve the reverse planning if taxes are expected to be higher in a later year. There are a number of rules that apply in determining in what year a particular item of income or expense falls.\n\nWhy: Understanding those rules is essential to permit a taxpayer to do effective year-end tax planning and to file an accurate tax return.\n\nThe taxpayer must know if they are on the cash method or accrual method of tax accounting. Individuals are typically on the cash method\n\nUnder the cash method, income is included in the year the income is actually or constructively received\n\nConstructive receipt is when the income is within the taxpayer\u2019s control but not actually received, with no substantial limitation on the taxpayer\u2019s right to the funds\n\nUnder the cash method, deductions or credits are permitted in the year when actually paid, unless they are required to be allocated to a different period to more clearly reflect income\n\nThere may be a limit on the deduction of a payment if it creates an asset having a useful life extending substantially beyond the end of the year in which the payment is made\n\nCredit card payments are deductible in the year charged even if the credit card bill is not paid until the following year\n\nChecks can be deducted in the year mailed even if not cashed or deposited until the following year\n\nItems such as mortgage interest, real estate taxes, and property insurance can be prepaid in the current year for some portion of the following year\n\nA recent revenue ruling from the IRS clarifies that a taxpayer\u2019s failure to cash a retirement plan distribution check received before year-end, but not deposited until after year-end, is still income in the year the check was received\n\nWho: Federal tax expert Mark Luscombe, JD, LL.M, CPA, Principal Federal Tax Analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting, is available to discuss the rules involving year-end inclusion of income and expense items and tax planning to minimize taxes.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The content of this article is designed to provide accurate and authoritative information in regard to the subject matter covered.
