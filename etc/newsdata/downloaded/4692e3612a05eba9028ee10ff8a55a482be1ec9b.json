Bullion\u2019s decline, if it holds, would push the metal to its weakest level since Oct. 1 and produce its sharpest daily slump since Sept. 30, according to FactSet data.\n\nFor the week, gold is on track to lose 1.9%, which would represent the firmest weekly decline for the most-active contract since a 2% decline in the week ended Nov. 9, 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, December silver SIZ19, -0.64% lost 14 cents, or 0.8%, to trade at $17.465 an ounce, putting gold\u2019s sister metal on pace for a weekly decline of 0.1%.\n\nMarkets were buoyant, after President Donald Trump offered an upbeat assessment of the talks and said he would meet with China Vice Premier Liu He on Friday, the final day of the most recent round of high-level trade discussions.\n\nOptimism around a possible resolution has given a lift to stocks, while undercutting appetite for assets perceived as havens like gold and government bonds. The Dow Jones Industrial DJIA, +0.57% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.64% were both set to jump in Friday action.\n\nMeanwhile, growing hopes that U.K. and European leaders can reach a deal for Britain to leave the European Union also pushed equity markets higher and precious metals\u2019 prices lower\n\n\u201cInvestors are now waiting for further market movers, while prices are compressed between $1,480 and $1,520,\u201d said Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst, ActivTrades.", "description": "Gold futures head lower Friday, putting bullion on track to record its steepest daily drop in October and dragging the commodity to around its lowest level...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FZ697_gold_g_ZG_20171206134155.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
