They set fires, hurled petrol bombs at police and burned the Chinese national flag, in a direct challenge to authorities in Beijing.\n\nPolice said an officer in Yuen Long, a district in the outlying New Territories that saw fierce clashes in July, had fired a shot in self-defence after a protester threw a petrol bomb at him, setting him on fire.\n\nLocal media reported a 14-year-old boy had been shot and the city\u2019s Hospital Authority said a 14-year-old was in a serious condition, without giving further details.\n\nRail operator MTR corp suspended the whole network, leaving people stranded across the city, many forced to walk home.\n\nIn a statement, it said protesters had set fires at multiple stations, including to an empty train, and injured two staff.\n\n\"As we are no longer in a position to provide safe and reliable service to passengers in the circumstances, the Corporation had no choice but to make the decision to suspend the service of its entire network including Heavy Rail, Light Rail and MTR bus,\" it said in a statement on Saturday morning.\n\nThe airport express, the city's main link to the airport, would also stay closed, it said, while more than a dozen shopping malls, which shut their doors early on Friday in anticipation of violence, said they would also not re-open.\n\nAround a hundred demonstrators besieged a Bank of China (HK) branch in the high-end shopping district of Causeway Bay, while across the harbour in Kowloon district protesters smashed the glass store front of a China Life branch.\n\nPolice fired volleys of tear gas to disperse protesters in flashpoint districts across the territory, including Causeway Bay, Sha Tin and Wong Tai Sin, underscoring the challenges facing authorities as the protests show no sign of letting up.\n\nFurther demonstrations are planned for the weekend, including a march on Saturday from Salisbury Garden in Kowloon.
