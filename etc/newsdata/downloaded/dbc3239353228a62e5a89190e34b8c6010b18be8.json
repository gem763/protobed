On the first Friday after Labor Day, these blocks were populated with crowds of artists and art lovers, all drawn by the siren song of possibility. But the smell of money, hustling collectors, and deal-makers was nowhere to be found. Instead, the air was filled with a feeling that\u2019s been hard to come by for some time: hope. A batch of galleries opened for the very first time that night. Others had been there for a while. Many have come looking for new homes, trying to escape the alienating slew of High Line tourists and the costly rents of Chelsea.\n\nCan a claim be staked here? Against all odds, can New York have a good art neighborhood with a walkable density of galleries? Galleries with wooden floors, flaws, and funny footprints, which are more like where artists actually make art than all those perfect, concrete-floored slick showrooms? And, unlike Chelsea and Upper East Side and elsewhere, Tribeca spaces come with basements for storage. This is a big deal when such space can cost a fortune all by itself and is often impossible to come by.\n\nAs always with New York, some of these opportunities were born of tragic and dispiriting circumstances. Numerous Tribeca businesses shuttered after 9/11, and retail has basically died in the ensuing years. Bruce Ehrmann, a broker for Douglas Elliman who has lived in Tribeca since 1988 (and is married to a painter), says that there are few retail tenants these days \u201cfor these classic gallery spaces with their high ceilings and Corinthian cast-iron columns.\u201d The leases aren\u2019t bad either \u2014 and usually ten years or longer. That will give the galleries a chance to withstand market blows and maybe grow.\n\nFor us older aficionados, it has been stunning to see, for the first time in decades, this former home to artists, artist haunts and hangouts, galleries, and seedier things come alive. Among the ghosts of Tribeca are the Mudd Club, where New Wave and punk were given life, in a building owned by an artist; Artists Space, the artist-run gallery that staged Pictures, one of the most famous shows of the late 20th century, in 1977; and the Baby Doll Lounge, where the lost, poor, and art-world wannabes worked as strippers or sat nursing loneliness and pain. (Hi.) That Friday I saw these streets teem again with love of art, eagerness, connection, and people looking for art away from the corporate noise. It was like being in New York City again.\n\nNone of this means the other art neighborhoods are bad. But this Tribeca (ish) scene doesn\u2019t feel too cool or closed. There\u2019s an emotional\u2013spiritual-metaphysical warmth to the spaces, the art, the people. These galleries show lots of women artists and are finally getting better at representing artists of color. (Right now, however, the audience is still mainly white. This must change \u2014 otherwise this scene will be a dead duck before it begins.) And while it\u2019s true that artists were priced out of this area years ago, there\u2019s still a funkiness to the neighborhood. Which may be why Tribeca dealers seem eager to sit once again and talk with art-interested audiences, anyone \u2014 even me and you.\n\nPhoto: New York Magazine\n\nA l e x a n d e r a n d B o n i n 47 Walker St. Founded in 1995, this gallery shows diverse activist artists \u2014 many known all over the world, many not and ripe for discovery.\n\nA n d r e w K r e p s G a l l e r y 22 Cortlandt Alley Roe Ethridge, Childhood Memories (Raggedy Andy) (2019). Photo: Roe Ethridge/Courtesy the Artist and Andrew Kreps Gallery, New York A crucial component of the art world, Kreps spots artists early and often, and almost no one has left it for the honeyed smell of megagalleries. A contender for the heavyweight crown.\n\na p e x a r t 291 Church St. Here since 1994, this oldest of Tribeca residents is also one of the better independent not-for-profit spaces.\n\nB o r t o l a m i 39 Walker St. Exceptionally dynamic in terms of post-Conceptual practice \u2014 which in non-artspeak means brainy work that challenges your ideas of what art even is.\n\nC a n a d a 60 Lispenard St. Xylor Jane, Days Alive (2019). Photo: Xylor Jane/Courtesy of Canada, New York So many amazing painters got their start at Canada that it\u2019s impossible to name them all. And it looks ready to set the world on fire again. Right now, see Xylor Jane \u2014 an American Bridget Riley and possibly better!\n\nC h a r t 74 Franklin St. The brand-new Chart\u2019s third show, featuring newcomer Shona McAndrew\u2019s radically vulnerable large-scale paintings of young women, instantly puts it on the map. Go. Thank me later.\n\nT h e D r a w i n g C e n t e r 35 Wooster St. Under new director Laura Hoptman, this long-dormant institution is rising again.\n\nJ a m e s C o h a n 48 Walker St. Josiah McElheny, Moon Mirror.

Right now, its Lily van der Stokker installation takes you to the heart of the medical Establishment and home cures.\n\nK e r r y S c h u s s 73 Leonard St. Moki Cherry (c. 1995).

Expect that to change soon.\n\nP . P . O . W . 20 Cortlandt Alley Perhaps the most activist small-big DIY downtown gallery of the last 40 years. Coming next year. Boom!\n\nQ u e e r T h o u g h t s 373 Broadway Best gallery name in Tribeca; this teeny office space is all about pushing political boundaries with great work.\n\nR & C o m p a n y 64 White St. Devoted to design, this outfit features killer shows of every kind: right now, an awesome array of chairs.\n\nT e a m G a l l e r y 83 Grand St. You want to see into the future and test your taste? That\u2019s what I do every time I go to a Jos\u00e9 Freire gallery; he\u2019s been in continual business since the old East Village days of the 1980s.\n\n*A version of this article appears in the September 16, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
