Hawaii is blaming the prevalence of online dating. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nSexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are on the rise in the U.S., but one state in particular is blaming online dating for the uptick.\n\nHawaii is experiencing record-high STD rates \u2014 and officials are pointing a finger at the prevalence of online dating, which makes it easier for people to find sexual (as well romantic) partners, along with a drop in the use of protection.\n\n\u201cOnline dating is part of what maybe some people refer to as the \u2018hookup culture\u2019 \u2014 having casual sex outside of committed relationships,\u201d Dean Winslow, MD, an infectious diseases physician at Stanford Health Care, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cI think that online dating is more connected to really facilitating the opportunities to have sexual encounters.\u201d\n\nGerald Hasty, PhD, program coordinator for Hawaii\u2019s Department of Health Harm Reduction Services Branch, told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that the trend may be increasing exposure. \u201cAs people rely on digital means of making connections, it can lead to circumstances where they might be more exposed to infection without them knowing it,\u201d he said. \u201cMore partners, more chances to get infections.\u201d\n\nVox reported in 2017 that online dating sites have \u201cdisrupted the way people have sex\u201d \u2014 but these sites don\u2019t necessarily want to be involved in STD prevention. \u201cThey are hesitant to support sexual health,\u201d Jeffrey Klausner, MD, a professor of medicine and STD researcher at UCLA, told the publication. \u201cThey realize that their sites could be stigmatized for being associated with STDs. They do as little as possible.\u201d\n\nLower rates of safe sex are also contributing to the record-high STD rates. \u201c[A contraceptive] sort of interrupts the spontaneity of having sex and it\u2019s inconvenient and a little bit messy.\u201d But when used consistently (and correctly) ... [it] provides a physical barrier that reduces the risk of getting several sexually transmitted infections, according to the CDC.\n\nHawaii is not alone in seeing a rise in STD rates, however. A new report from the CDC shows that three STDs in particular \u2014 chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis \u2014 have increased across the U.S. Chlamydia is up 3 percent to more than 1.7 million cases, while gonorrhea rose by 5 percent to more than 580,000 cases (the highest number reported since 1991, according to the CDC). Syphilis is up by 14 percent to more than 35,000 cases \u2014 also the highest number reported since 1991. (The CDC also reports a \u201cgrowing threat\u201d of newborn deaths caused by syphilis passed from mother to baby during pregnancy.)\n\n\u201cAll three are at [or near] their highest rates in about 30 years,\u201d Hasty told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re all increasing is not desirable, but it\u2019s also not unexpected.\u201d\n\nSince some STDs have mild to no symptoms, it\u2019s possible to be infected and not know it. \u201cYou could still transmit the disease even if you don\u2019t have symptoms,\u201d notes Winslow. Added Hasty: \"That sets the stage for the infections to be spread. Lack of regular screenings or routine screenings contribute to increasing rates.\"\n\nWinslow tells Yahoo Lifestyle that people also tend to underestimate how easy it is to get an STD. \u201cI think there\u2019s a false perception that these diseases are not as easily transmitted as they are and that it\u2019s not a big deal to treat them once you get them,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis can all be treated with antibiotics, if left untreated, they can lead to several different health issues. Chlamydia, which is the most commonly reported STD in the U.S., can cause \u201cserious, permanent damage to a woman\u2019s reproductive system,\u201d according to the CDC, affecting a woman\u2019s ability to become pregnant. As the CDC points out: \u201cEven when chlamydia causes no symptoms, it can damage your reproductive system.\u201d\n\nGonorrhea \u2014 a common infection, especially in people 15 to 24 years old \u2014 can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, which can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy and infertility, according to the CDC. Syphilis \u2014 marked by firm, round, painless sores \u2014 can spread to the brain or nervous system if left untreated, according to the CDC, causing headaches, paralysis, dementia, and vision problems, including blindness.", "description": "STDs across the U.S. are on the rise.
