The victim was shot on his left upper arm.\u201d\n\nNaicker said police are still trying to find Zulu.\n\n\u201cThe victim was taken to hospital where he was treated and discharged. At this stage police are trying to locate the victim.\u201d\n\nZulu, who was one of the people who lifted the lid on Magaqa\u2019s murder, told Eyewitness News over a week ago that police deliberately failed to grant him and other whistle-blowers protection in the wake of recent political killings in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post Sindiso Magaqa\u2019s Friend And Whistleblower Thabiso Zulu Shot In KZN appeared first on iAfrica.com.", "description": "Sindiso Magaqa\u2019s Friend And Whistleblower Thabiso Zulu Shot In KZN", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/news_pile_69x52._800x533_L_1419494209.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
