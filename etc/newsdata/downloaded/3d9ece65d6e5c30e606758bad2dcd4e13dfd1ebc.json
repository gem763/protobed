Photo: Amanda Edwards/WireImage\n\nIn his post\u2013That \u201970s Show, pre-The Ranch years, Ashton Kutcher was very famously married to Demi Moore, until the duo decided to not-so-amicably separate in 2011 \u2014 which culminated after a widely publicized cheating scandal by Kutcher. In her new memoir, Inside Out, excerpted by Us Weekly, Moore is now revealing the other threads that contributed to her divorce from Kutcher, the main one being his insistence on constantly exploring threesomes with other women. \u201cI wanted to show him how great and fun I could be,\u201d Moore wrote, ultimately agreeing to try the experience. However, she deemed her decision a \u201cmistake\u201d after their second threesome, and she claims Kutcher used those sexual trysts to shame her and \u201cdeflect blame\u201d after his cheating became public. \u201cBecause we had brought a third party into our relationship, Ashton said, that blurred the lines and, to some extent, justified what he\u2019d done,\u201d Moore wrote. \u201cI felt sick to my stomach.\u201d\n\nMoore also revealed that she became pregnant with a girl during her first year of dating Kutcher, who she planned to name Chaplin Ray. Sadly, Moore suffered a miscarriage six months into the pregnancy, which she says subsequently contributed to excessive drinking and drug use. She also underwent several fertility treatments in the hopes of becoming pregnant again with Kutcher\u2019s child, but all of them were ultimately unsuccessful. Following their divorce, Kutcher would go on to reconnect with and marry his That \u201970s Show co-star, Mila Kunis, and they have two children.", "description": "In her memoir, Demi Moore reveals Ashton Kutcher loved having threeways and cheated on her.
