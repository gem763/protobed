It launched an offensive into Syria to crush the group after Mr Trump ordered US forces out of northern Syria last week.\n\nThe comments were greeted with disbelief by senior US officials.\n\nSmoke plumes from fires set by Kurdish forces to reduce visibility for Turkish aircraft near the town of Tal Tamr Credit: DELIL SOULEIMAN/AFP More\n\nLindsey Graham, the republican senator for South Carolina and a Trump loyalist, described Mr Trump's comments as \"a complete and utter national security disaster in the making.\"\n\n\"The statements by President Trump about Turkey\u2019s invasion being of no concern to us also completely undercut Vice President Pence and Sec.
