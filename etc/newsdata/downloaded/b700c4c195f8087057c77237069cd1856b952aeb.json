But that alone doesn't mean it's good. This a performance car, not a power generator, so it needs a whole lot more than just an engine.\n\nFortunately, the GT500 brings it all.\n\nFord F So there would not be an opportunity to test the power from the GT500's 5.2-liter supercharged V8 on this route. I'd have to wait for that. I test drove the GT500 outside of Las Vegas. We started out near a drag strip, but the first thingdid was point me toward the Nevada desert so I could drive it on roads that twisted through massive rock formations and up steep hills.
