When the 47-year-old finally sought help, doctors told AsiaWire that she walked into the out-patient clinic holding the tumor up because it was so heavy.\n\nCONSTRUCTION WORKER ATTEMPTS TO PULL NAIL OUT OF THIGH WITH PLIERS AFTER HORRIFIC INJURY\n\n\u201cYou could tell something was odd from the start, because she walked in holding a large object by her chest,\u201d Dr. Wu Jian, of the Third People\u2019s Hospital of Chengdu, in Sichuan Province, told AsiaWire. \u201cIt was a tumor growth on her left breast which was larger than a basketball.\u201d\n\nWu said his patient, identified only as \u201cMs. Jiang,\u201d had tried to treat the growth with ointments and herbal medicines, according to AsiaWire. He said the last doctor who saw Jiang warned that her only option was to go for surgery, but it\u2019s not clear how long she waited between her doctor visits.\n\nMOM COULD 'SEE SKIN BLISTERING AND PEELING' AFTER HOT WATER BOTTLE EXPLODED ON LEGS\n\n\u201cBut had she not had surgery, the tumor would have burst through her skin,\u201d he told AsiaWire. \u201cBecause of the amount of nutrition it was absorbing, it would\u2019ve caused problems such as anemia and malnutrition. It\u2019s very seldom you see someone willing to let their tumor grow to such a size, to the point where she has to lift it with her hand in order to leave the house. Don\u2019t let this happen. It only leads to increased physical trauma during surgery, and further complicates the operation.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWu and his team removed the tumor in a five-hour surgery on Sept. 25. It was found to be malignant. Still, despite the risks from removing such a large mass, Jiang is not expected to have any major complications from the surgery, AsiaWire reported.", "description": "Her doctor said that for two years she forewent chemotherapy and surgery in favor of ointments and herbal medicines.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/ball-tomour.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
