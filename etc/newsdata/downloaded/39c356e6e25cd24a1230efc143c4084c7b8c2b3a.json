Johnson had hoped to keep the prospect of a no-deal scenario on the table in a bid to strengthen his hand in last-ditch negotiations with the EU to get amendments to the Brexit deal on offer.\n\nWhat happens next is uncertain, with various potential scenarios including a possible snap election \u2013 the timing of which could largely determine the direction Brexit takes given the default position is that the U.K. leaves the EU on October 31 \u2014 if the government does not request a further delay \u2014 with or without a deal.\n\nJohnson said Tuesday that he would put forward a motion to hold a snap election, although he needs two-thirds of parliament to approve a vote. A vote of no confidence in the government could also be tabled by the opposition.\n\nAfter hitting a level not seen since October 2016 on Tuesday, sterling rose following the vote to trade at $1.2123 on Wednesday.", "description": "Market focus is firmly on U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's next move after losing control of parliamentary business on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Holly Ellyatt"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106110389-1567580239718gettyimages-1165907182.jpeg?v=1567580256"}
