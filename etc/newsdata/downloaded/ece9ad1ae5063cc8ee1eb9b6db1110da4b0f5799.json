The Mustangs are at home Saturday against Temple (5-1, 2-0) in a matchup of AAC division co-leaders.\n\nWhile the Mustangs are off to their best start since resuming play in 1989 after the NCAA death penalty and a two-year hiatus from games, they are only halfway through the regular season. They still have the bulk of their conference schedule to play, including Memphis - which was ranked and undefeated before losing at Temple last week - Navy and West Division co-leader Tulane.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to look at it, all the way through and say, \u2018Wow, we\u2019re going to play a lot of good football teams,\u2019 and a bunch of teams that have had a lot of success,\u201d Dykes said. \u201cThe one thing that\u2019s getting ready to happen with our league is kind of what happened last week, where you\u2019ve got two really good teams playing each other \u2026 teams are going to start knocking each other off in the league.\u201d\n\nLike Temple did last against then-No. 23 Memphis, winning 30-28 after building an early 16-0 lead. The Owls have won their last five conference games.\n\nBoth SMU and Memphis have high-scoring, big-gaining offenses with two of the league\u2019s most efficient passers (SMU\u2019s Shane Buechele leads the league with 277.5 yards per game) and running backs who average more than 100 yards a game. The Mustangs also feature receivers James Proche (AAC-high 7.5 catches a game, third with 88.2 yards receiving per game) and Reggie Roberson Jr (90.8 yards per game).\n\n\u201cThey do it so different,\u201d first-year Temple coach Rod Carey said of the Mustangs and Tigers. \u201cI think the fact that they\u2019re explosive gets your attention when you watch the film and you see them, run the ball, throw the ball, execute at a high level. But both teams do it so different that really the carryover, there\u2019s not a ton there.\u201d\n\nRANKED WINS\n\nTemple already has two wins over ranked teams, the first time the Owls have defeated two Top 25 teams in the same season.\n\n\u201cTo be the best, you\u2019ve got to beat the best, whether that\u2019s the best in our conference, the best in the country,\u201d quarterback Anthony Russo said. \u201cWe want to be the best.\u201d\n\nAfter winning 20-17 over then-No. 21 Maryland on September 14, the Owls lost at Buffalo the following week.\n\nSOME IMPRESIVE NUMBERS\n\nRe\u2019Mahn Davis has 575 yards rushing for Temple, the most for an FBS true freshman. \u2026 Temple and SMU are among three AAC teams with multiple players averaging at least 100 all-purpose yards per game: WR Isaiah Wright (125.8 ypg) and Davis for the Owls; RB Xavier Jones (115.5 ypg) and Proche (100 ypg) for the Mustangs.\n\nON THE OTHER SIDE\n\nTemple assistant coach Brett Diersen was on Dykes\u2019 staff last season as defensive line coach. SMU defensive coordinator Kevin Kahne was previously on Carey\u2019s staff at Northern Illinois.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Temple will have a plan to adjust what they need to adjust, as we will as well,\u201d Dykes said. \u201cAt the end of the day, the players decide the game. \u2026 That stuff gets blown out of proportion.\u201d\n\nLOT OF POINTS AFTER ALL TIED UP\n\nThe Mustangs and Owls have played some high-scoring games in their three meetings as AAC foes. SMU won 59-49 in 2013, but Temple has won the last two meetings - 60-40 in 2015, and 45-20 the following season. The only other two games in the series were ties of 6-6 and 7-7 back in the 1940s.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "No. 19 SMU got a chance to take its breath right in the middle of its best season since the Pony Express days.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/tulsa_smu_football_56372_c0-165-3960-2475_s1200x700.jpg?7e94a7429cda5d45e55e7979fe6e9ea783446f12", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
