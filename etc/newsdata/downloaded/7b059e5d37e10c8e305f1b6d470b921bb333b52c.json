Having been found guilty of failing to slow after an accident he was given a three-place grid penalty and will start from fourth. Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc now takes pole, with Sebastian Vettel shifted up to second and Lewis Hamilton to third.\n\nVerstappen was always likely to face stern criticism and indeed the punishment he received, for what many will see as the dangerous manner with which he originally sealed the place. His final two laps were superb but for a driver still trying to shake off a reputation for recklessness and lapses of judgment, he was surprisingly unconcerned by his decision not to slow as he rounded the final corner where Valtteri Bottas\u2019s Mercedes lay after crashing into the barriers.\n\nThe crucial moments came in the final seconds of Q3. Verstappen held the top spot from his first run but as Bottas went though the final corner he clipped the wall and took a major, 17G impact. His stricken car was left at the side of the track but the Finn was unharmed.\n\nMexican circuit designed by a student will be examination for Mercedes Read more\n\nVerstappen entered the corner shortly afterwards, where stewards were waving single yellow flags, denoting that drivers should slow down. However, although there appeared to be no yellow indicators on the Dutchman\u2019s dashboard, he would still have been expected to slow and in the past drivers have had times set under yellow flags deleted.\n\nVerstappen, however, said he had not slowed down. \u201cI was aware Valtteri crashed,\u201d he said. When asked if he had backed off, he made no attempt at deception. \u201cIt didn\u2019t really look like it, did it? No.\u201d\n\nJust under two hours later the stewards summoned Verstappen for failing to slow at the corner and he was given the penalty, having admitted not slowing and with the stewards noting the yellow flags had been clearly visible.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Valtteri Bottas emerges from the wreckage of his car.

He said that even had the FIA deleted his time, his first run would still have been good enough for pole and that he was simply pushing hard on his final run. \u201cI think we know what we are doing,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise we wouldn\u2019t be driving an F1 car. It\u2019s qualifying, you go for it, but like I said before if they want to delete the lap then delete the lap.\u201d His ultimate punishment proved far more costly.\n\nThe accident may prove to be beneficial for Hamilton\u2019s attempt to secure his sixth title here. If he finishes 14 points in front of Bottas the British driver will secure the championship. Bottas was in sixth place after the crash and he may yet take penalties for repairs, although the team said they were 90% sure they could fix the car without incurring a grid drop.\n\nAlexander Albon was in fifth for Red Bull. Verstappen was quickest in Q1, with Hamilton topping the timesheets in Q2. McLaren\u2019s Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris were in seventh and eighth with Toro Rosso\u2019s Daniil Kvyat and Pierre Gasly in ninth and tenth.\n\nMexico\u2019s Sergio P\u00e9rez was in 11th for Racing Point, in front of the Renaults of Nico H\u00fckenberg and Daniel Ricciardo. Alfa Romeo\u2019s Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Antonio Giovinazzi were in 14th and 15th.\n\nLance Stroll was in 16th for Racing Point. With Kevin Magnussen and Romain Grosjean in 16th and 17th for Haas. George Russell and Robert Kubica were in 19th and 20th for Williams.", "description": "Max Verstappen took pole for the Mexican Grand Prix but was given a three-place grid penalty after failing to slow down following Valtteri Bottas\u2019s crash at the end of qualifying", "authors": ["Giles Richards"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0c20decb036cbab87deba4a66ffb92f1c2a3540/0_0_4407_2644/master/4407.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4ef8b2eb7bb9afe1749f9b0f9ee57a98", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
