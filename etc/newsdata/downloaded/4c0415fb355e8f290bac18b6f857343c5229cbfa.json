The loss of fast bowlers Duane Olivier and Kyle Abbott, batsman Rilee Rossouw and spinner Simon Harmer, among others, to so-called Kolpak contracts to play in England that prevent them playing for the national team has also been a blow.\n\n\u201cWe are losing our experience in international cricket, but we are also losing our experience in domestic cricket,\u201d Du Plessis said.\n\n\u201cYour top players domestically are going overseas, so you are missing out on a lot of your best players, a talent pool that is all of a sudden a lot smaller.\n\n\u201cAnd the gap between domestic cricket and intentional cricket \u2013 there needs to be things put in place to make sure you can address that a little bit better.\u201d\n\nDu Plessis admits South Africa have had to rebuild from scratch, and with a four-test home series against England looming in December and January, they are in a vulnerable place.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough place to start, right at the beginning. Obviously, in a perfect world, you will start somewhere in the middle, change one or two players and that period takes a little bit shorter,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut the position we find ourselves in now, with a lot of experience out of the Test team, that process will probably take a little bit longer.\u201d", "description": "There is no quick fix for South Africa\u2019s ailing Test team in the wake of their demoralising series whitewash in India, captain Faf du Plessis said, as retirements, defections abroad and an under-performing domestic scene drag them into mediocrity.", "authors": ["Nick Said", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444048601&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0MH", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
