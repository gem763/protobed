The posting sparked widespread confusion among small employers, according to the administration.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s new order says agencies must seek public input on important rules moving forward, to increase transparency.\n\nThe president wants to avoid a re-run of the ordeal faced by Richard Schok, who operates Tin Cup LLC, a family-owned pipe-fabrication business in Alaska.\n\nHe purchased land near Fairbanks that contained wetlands, forcing him to seek a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers before expanding his business.\n\nYet the corps said they found 200 acres of permafrost that qualified as wetlands, too, according to its interpretation of an \u201cAlaska Supplement\u201d to the Corps\u2019 1987 Wetlands Manual.\n\nThe Trump administration says the supplement was never delivered to Congress and, therefore, shouldn\u2019t have been considered lawful.\n\nA second, \u201cTransparency and Fairness\u201d order will shield Americans from \u201cunlawful interpretations\u201d of regulations or unfair penalties.\n\nIt requires agencies to proactively educate the public about regulations and give people a chance to comply with the rules, instead of slapping fines on them through \u201crogue\u201d agency action.\n\nThe administration cited the 2013 case of Andy Johnson of Wyoming, who dammed a stream on his property to build a pond for his four daughters\u2019 horses.\n\nThe pond had environmental benefits for a variety of fish and bird species, yet the Environmental Protection Agency said he failed to seek permission for the construction, so he could either rip out the pond or face $20 million in fines.\n\nMr. Johnson\u2019s lawyers said stock ponds were exempt from EPA reach, but that agency officials used a narrow interpretation from guidance documents to crack down.\n\nA front-page story from the New York Times forced the EPA to back off and settle the case. Mr. Johnson kept his pond without paying fines, and the episode inspired Mr. Trump\u2019s push to reform the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
