There were not many positives. We accept defeat and accept we have to be better than we were.\u201d", "description": "Gareth Southgate has admitted his England team suffered a reality check after falling to their first qualification defeat for 10 years against Czech Republic in Prague.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Football News Correspondent", "Jason Burt", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212764828-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
