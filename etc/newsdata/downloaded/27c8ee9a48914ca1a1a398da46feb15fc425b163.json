The judgment said the flag may be used for academic purposes. I am a scholar of Constitutional Law, currently doing my doctorate. This is an academic question. It seems the NMF\u2019s quest for apartheid style censorship & banning continues. https://t.co/qRvfFzd2RK \u2014 Ernst Roets (@ErnstRoets) August 22, 2019\n\nBad faith\n\nREAD | Racists display old SA flag because they yearn for apartheid SA, court hears\n\nRoets said he posted the flag because he was posing an \"academic question\", adding that it seemed that the Nelson Mandela Foundation's quest for \"apartheid style censorship & banning continues\".\n\nIn a media statement on Friday, the foundation said the Equality Act did not protect academic displays of the flag that were made in bad faith.\n\nIt said it was of the view that Roets' action was in \"bad faith\" and \"contempt of court\".\n\n\"It was also disrespectful to the Deputy Judge President of the High Court. The Foundation has reached out on many occasions, publicly and privately, to collaborate with AfriForum and work together toward healing the wounds of the past and building the country described in our Constitution. These efforts have been rejected by AfriForum,\" the statement reads.\n\nSouth African Human Rights Commission CEO Tseliso Thipanyane told News24 on Thursday that the commission would not hesitate to act on complaints lodged over Roets' tweets.\n\n\"Now that the court has made a ruling on the matter, anybody who intentionally posts this flag in a manner which goes against the ruling, the commission will deal with those persons in a manner we deem fit,\" Thipanyane said.\n\nWhen News24 contacted Roets for comment on the foundation's statement, he said he would first consult his lawyers before responding.\n\n\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
