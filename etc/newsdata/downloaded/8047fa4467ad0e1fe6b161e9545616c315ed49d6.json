The last few years have been a time of listening to people\u2019s hopes and fears, learning new ways to innovate responsibly, and leading toward flexible and vigorous standards that will protect these rights for decades.\n\nNow, we and our elected leaders must act.\n\nNo company has ever succeeded without listening intently to its customers. In doing so, businesses large and small have begun coming to grips with the implications of collecting so much data, data that IBM and many others liken to \u201ca new natural resource.\u201d This natural resource has come to include people\u2019s names and identifying information like Social Security numbers, as well as personal proof points gleaned from a specific device that could be used to identify that individual.\n\nDoes that mean me, and the places I pause in a grocery store aisle, and even the products I pick up and those I brush past? It does, and then some. Does it include health status, relationship indicators, financial records and many more of the most personal facts, preferences and insights? All of these and more are the kinds of data in question.\n\nLike any natural resource, personal data must be protected and conserved.\n\nLearning how to collect and manage this information is an unending process for IBM, as well as for many of our competitors and clients. In complying with existing laws, we\u2019ve seen where they have fallen short of client and public expectations.\n\nAnd one thing that American business has learned is that our nation urgently needs comprehensive, federal consumer privacy legislation. If companies are to live up to society\u2019s expectations of trust and transparency, there must be a legal framework that is seamless across our 50 states -- and accountability measures that support these new laws. Corporate pledges and industry best practices can\u2019t alone police bad actors who will exploit data for their own ends without respect for consumers\u2019 privacy.\n\nConsumers deserve consistent privacy protections nationwide, no matter where they are or what they\u2019re doing \u2013 from banking, shopping, reading the news or sharing experiences and stories with friends. If we want technology and the digital economy to continue propelling American innovation and leadership in the world, we need legislation to strengthen those protections now.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe U.S. technology industry has shown itself to be a tremendous creator of jobs and prosperity. Increasingly, the benefits of technology are unlocking new opportunities in communities across this country where tech jobs have been scarce at best. With well-crafted privacy legislation, we can protect and grow this economic success story and avoid patchwork approaches that stifles innovation and risks ceding America\u2019s high-tech leadership\n\nIn 2000, IBM was the first major company in our industry to establish a Chief Privacy Officer position. We saw then the opportunity for privacy to impact our economic and social dialogue. Today, we see just as much opportunity for business and government to partner in a way that puts privacy at the forefront of America\u2019s competitive edge.\n\nChristina Montgomery is Chief Privacy Officer and an IBM Vice President.
