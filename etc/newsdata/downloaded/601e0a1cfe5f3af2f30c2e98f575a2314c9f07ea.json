So too was the university\u2019s response to their crimes.\u201d\n\nLast year, Nassar was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison for abusing dozens of girls and young women under the guise of providing medical treatment.\n\nHe was also given a separate sentence of up to 125 years for the abuse and an additional 60-year federal prison term for child pornography.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Mr Strampel was also found to have to subjected students to a \u201csexually hostile\u201d environment, and repeatedly failed to take action regarding the horrific situation.\n\n\u201cToo many people in power knew about the behaviours and the complaints, and yet the predators continued on the payroll and abused even more students,\u201d Ms DeVos told reporters.\n\nUnder the settlement, the university will also have create a system for complying with the Clery Act in the future, and offer support to those impacted by past sexual misconduct.", "description": "Michigan State University has been ordered to pay a $4.5m fine for failing to protect students from sexual abuse, education secretary Betsy DeVos\u00a0has announced.
