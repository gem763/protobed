The school system was able to close more than $15 million on its own. The mayor\u2019s office said it would help close the rest, although that has not been finalized.\n\nKihn said the city has until Nov. 7 to finalize its books. Under D.C. law, agencies cannot carry debt from fiscal year to fiscal year.\n\n\u201cWe also continue to explore equitable solutions to resolve the budget gap for fiscal year 2019 by November 7,\u201d Kihn said.\n\nBut the effort by the mayor\u2019s office to help the traditional system during the recently concluded budget year drew a rebuke from some charter leaders, who said the city should not be giving additional money to one sector and not the other.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe call upon you in the strongest terms to adhere to the legal requirement that all funding to DC public schools shall be equal and uniform; and denounce any remedy to this fiscal shortfall that would reward overspending while punishing those who live within their means,\u201d Ramona Edelin, executive director of the advocacy group D.C. Association of Chartered Public Schools, wrote in a letter that she said she plans to deliver to city officials. Edelin has been collecting signatures for the letter from charter leaders in the city.\n\nKihn said the school system employed more effective and experienced teachers than it had anticipated, which translated into higher wages and contributed to the deficit. He said the additional money is intended to prevent another deficit.\n\nAD", "description": "Traditional public schools and charter campuses will share the money.", "authors": ["Perry Stein", "Reporter Covering D.C.
