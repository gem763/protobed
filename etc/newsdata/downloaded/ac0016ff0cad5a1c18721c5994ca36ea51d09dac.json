That ideology demands that the government outlaw any legal or civic recognition of the complementary sexual and biological differences between legally equal men and women.\n\nChart, a feminist writer at FeministCurrent.org, used her speech to urge other feminists to walk away from the men who dominate the transgender ideology:\n\nI\u2019ve been told that I am not a nice, inclusive person for saying that the law needs to be able to recognize sex. And not just me, but all the women who don\u2019t believe that human beings can change sex. We\u2019ve been, we\u2019ve even been accused of perpetrating genocide. It\u2019s funny because five years ago, I first started seeing lesbians were being publicly shamed, sexually harassed, and demonized by straight men calling themselves lesbians. These men also tended to call themselves progressives, feminists \u2026 They keep telling us now that they are absolutely indispensable to the women\u2019s movement, and we cannot do without them. Everyone can always see this behavior, and they always get away with it. I didn\u2019t think \u2014 and I still don\u2019t \u2014 that sexually harassing lesbians is a good way to be inclusive. So I objected. It turns out it\u2019s a firing offense on today\u2019s left to complain about men sexually harassing lesbians if that man says he feels like he\u2019s a lesbian. That harassment still goes on, and if anything, it has gotten worse. Women share shocking screenshots with me from lesbian dating apps, which are now just simply packed wall-to-wall with men. These men have even started getting women\u2019s [social media] profiles suspended for saying no to them and refusing to recognize their gender and validate their feelings. Across social media, women\u2019s accounts and access to public conversation is under permanent, constant surveillance for offenses against men claiming to be women, with catastrophic penalties for refusing to lie for them to spare their feelings. Is that nice behavior? What about my feelings? What about the feelings of all the women who have lost all access to public conversation on social media? I saw that President [Barack] Obama made several moves to end single-sex facilities for women and girls through executive branch orders and funding threats. His administration and now the entire Democratic congressional caucus made a point of insisting on an end to women\u2019s rights to bodily privacy from men whenever we are outside our homes. If a woman complains that a man has dropped his trousers in front of her at a job, the left will shout \u201cMe Too!\u201d in solidarity, and he\u2019ll be cancelled. If a woman complains because he dropped his trousers in front of her at a gym locker, but he says he\u2019s a woman, they\u2019ll cancel her. Is that kind? Was it inclusive when the women who objected to that [trouser dropping] were fired for it? Women are still being fired if they dare to say anything against this. Anywhere on the left, some of us may be fired for the offense of appearing at this [alliance] gathering today. None of the women at liberal organizations can say no to this [transgender] agenda or their peers will destroy them, and that makes their consent to this [transgender ideology] \u2014 their support for it \u2014 as meaningful as a hostage statement. Last night, a woman wrote to me, a progressive reporter who is outspoken and not shy to hold unpopular opinions, to ask for a quote for this [transgender legal] case. And after she got my reply, she said to me, she wrote, \u201cI just met Aimee [Stephens, the plaintiff in the lawsuit], she prepares for tomorrow, she is a woman.\u201d And I asked her, \u201cIn what way is Stephens a woman?\u201d And she said, and I quote, \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of what I think.\u201d And I\u2019m here [to protest] for her [the reporter] today, even though she probably really dislikes me. It is the right of all women to speak publicly and be able to petition our government for the redress of our grievances and be able to participate openly in the public sphere. I have seen numerous women banned from social media for pointing out that gender transition treatments leave children sterile for life at ages where they can\u2019t possibly consent to such permanent decisions. But a generation of quirky, stereotype-rejecting kids \u2014 many of whom would grow up to identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, many of whom are autistic \u2014 are being sterilized as minors now. And the only crime that the left or social media companies seem to recognize in this is the crime of women objecting to the wholesale sterilization of vulnerable children. For that, we get accused of \u201cpromoting genocide.\u201d There are doctors in the U.S. who will go to work today and oversee the chemical castration of little boys, who will put 14-year-old girls into menopause, and give troubled young girls cosmetic mastectomies. And I object \u2014 and for that, I\u2019m considered dangerous. I\u2019ve seen public calls for every type of harm against those of us who object to the end of women\u2019s sex-based rights or who object to the sterilization of children. To the people who say \u2026 the only meaningful type of violence [they recognize] is that I refuse to call a man \u201cshe.\u201d Still others insist it is violent of me to associate with conservatives, in spite of the fact that gender activists associate with lots of conservatives, and I\u2019ve never seen anyone have a problem with that. It\u2019s almost like women who say no to these men [who say they are transgender] are just going to be wrong, no matter what we do. Sisters, when a man puts you under constant surveillance and retaliates whenever you say no, and huffs about being indispensable, and he makes you lie to spare his feelings, and he always puts you in the wrong \u2014 no matter what \u2014 that is not a partnership. It\u2019s abuse. Plan a way out before it gets worse. It will get worse. In closing, to echo my sisters in the U.K., a man can never be a woman. A lesbian can never be male. My name is Natasha Chart from New York state. I will not be forced to lie. I will not submit.\n\nThe primary victims of the transgender ideology are teens \u2014 including some who would otherwise mature into lesbian women or gay men. But there is no media focus b/c feminists & progressives want more TGs & the L&G groups are steered by transgender donors. https://t.co/bD7c8UNSZe \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 23, 2019\n\nTransgender Facts:\n\nIn general, the transgender ideology says a person\u2019s legal and civic recognition as a man or a woman is determined by their \u201cgender identity,\u201d not by their biology.\n\nThe ideology also insists that men and women are more or less interchangeable, and it objects to the public\u2019s view of the two sexes as simultaneously different, complementary, and equal.\n\nThe transgender advocates want to impose their ideology on Americans by establishing \u201ctransgender rights\u201d laws, which would require the Department of Justice to penalize individuals and groups who insist that biology determines male or female status \u2014 and also shapes peoples\u2019 likely political, civic, and personal priorities.\n\nPolls show the transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents. In 2017, former President Barack Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Donald Trump to win the presidency.\n\nMultiple polls show that most Americans reasonably wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology\u2019s claim that people\u2019s legal sex is determined by their feeling of \u201cgender identity,\u201d not by biology. A U.K. survey shows a similar mix of sympathy for people who say they are transgender alongside lopsided opposition to the ideology.\n\nThe transgender movement is diverse, so its different factions have competing goals and priorities. It includes sexual liberationists, progressives, feminists who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes, and people who glamorize the differences between the two sexes. It includes high-profile children, people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex, troubled teenage girls trying to flee womanhood, and people trying to \u201cde-transition\u201d back to their sex.\n\nIt also includes men who demand sex from lesbians, masculine autogynephiles who say they are entitled to women\u2019s rights, alpha males who insist they are the natural leaders of women, parents eager to support their children\u2019s\u2019 transgender claims, wealthy donors, politicians, political professionals, revenue-seeking drug companies, surgeons, and medical service providers.\n\nTransgender advocates claim that two million Americans say they are transgender to a greater or lesser extent. But very few people who describe themselves as transgender undergo cosmetic surgery of the genitals. Only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study. A Pentagon report commissioned by former Defense Secretary James Mattis said that \u201crates for genital surgery are exceedingly low \u2014 2% of transgender men and 10% of transgender women.\u201d\n\nYet the gender ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies.\n\nIn Ohio, for example, in February, a judge forced the parents of a teenage girl to give up custody so she can begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that will allow her to appear as a male.\n\nThe progressive push to bend Americans\u2019 attitudes and their male and female civic society around the idea of \u201cgender identity\u201d has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules that help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women.\n\nThese pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents\u2019 rights in childrearing, children\u2019s safety, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women\u2019s ideals of beauty, culture and civil society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men\u2019s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, military culture, and children\u2019s sexual privacy.", "description": "Feminists must escape from the sexual and political abuse inflicted by the men who dominate the transgender ideology, said a feminist author.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/feminists-protest-gender-ideology-supreme-court-bbn-screenshot-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
