Representatives in Northern Ireland would be able to decide whether to continue this arrangement every four years.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said it was a \"fair and balanced agreement\" - and suggested that it was the final deal on offer, saying there would be \"no other prolongation\".\n\nMs Sturgeon rejected this, saying: \"The alternative to this deal is the Benn Act, which would require an extension request. That's the law of the land. So anybody who says that it's a choice between this deal and no deal is frankly not being straight with people.\"", "description": "The first minister warns that the people of Scotland will never forgive Labour if it backs the withdrawal agreement.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5833/production/_105997522_brexitvotesturgeon1203_frame_679.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
