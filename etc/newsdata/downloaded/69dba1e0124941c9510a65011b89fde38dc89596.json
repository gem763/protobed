Landfills, filled more with discarded food than any other single item , account for one-third of all US methane gas emissions\n\nSo NGOs and nonprofits are tackling the problems of food waste and food insecurity by launching food-rescue programs . And you can help, too.\n\nRescuing 41 million pounds of food a year\n\nFor 29 years Forgotten Harvest, a nonprofit in Detroit, has been rescuing food destined for landfills and redirecting it to the hungry.\n\nForgotten Harvest CEO Kirk Mayes says it's taken that long to develop the logistics for his program, which now rescues and delivers 130,000 pounds of food a day.\n\nForgotten Harvest delivers donated food to churches, community centers, food banks and charities.\n\n\"This operation is set up so that our fleet of about 27 trucks and our drivers can leave our warehouse in the morning and go to about 12 to 14 different stops ... for our donations.\" Mayes says. Drivers collect food from local bakers and butchers and national chains, he says. \"And then these drivers redistribute the food to three to four community partners on a daily basis.\"\n\nA rotating army of 16,000 volunteers makes this daily event happen.\n\n\"At our warehouse, our volunteers are working with commodities that are coming off of our farm and from other commodity partners like the food manufacturers and other farms and donations,\" Mayes says. \"All this (food) is inspected, sorted and set to go out.\"\n\nVolunteers donated 54,000 hours of service to Forgotten Harvest in 2018.\n\nThe result? Last year Forgotten Harvest redistributed 41 million pounds of food, Mayes says. That's 41 million pounds that filled stomachs instead of landfills.\n\n\"We see a lot of work in front of us, with what is one in six people vulnerable for food insecurity in southeast Michigan,\" he says. \"We're all working towards our one mission -- to make sure that we can rescue as much food as possible and get it into the hands of people in need.\"\n\nHow you can help\n\nThey are also providing tips and guides for people to reduce the amount of food they waste:\n\nSupport food-rescue programs like Forgotten Harvest.
