However, there is a ton of support underneath so quite frankly this is a market that probably needs to be left alone at this point, as it has nowhere to be. A break down below the $2.20 level could open up the door down to the $2.00 level where we could reset and look for buyers again. We are in the time of year where eventually the buyers come back, but it\u2019s obvious they are ready to do so yet. With that in mind, this market will have no real directionality as it is at extreme lows and everybody already knows there\u2019s too much natural gas in the world. Quite frankly, there\u2019s no reason to express a negative viewpoint.\n\nNATGAS Video 11.10.19\n\nA break above the top of the candle stick for the trading session on Thursday could be a bullish sign and could have traders jumping into the marketplace, but right now I do not anticipate that happening with any type of gusto, as the world is currently paying attention to the US/China trade talks, which has an effect on every market in every direction. Rumors continue to persist, making trading almost impossible at this point. As long as that\u2019s going to be the case, you need to stay out of the less liquid markets like natural gas and stick to heavier traded markets such as currencies. Natural gas is probably a \u201cno touch\u201d until next week.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "Natural gas markets tried to rally during the trading session on Thursday but gave back all of the gains as the inventory number isn\u2019t exactly impressive.
