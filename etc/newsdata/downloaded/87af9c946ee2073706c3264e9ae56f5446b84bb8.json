Spencer, Mr Hockey urged both sides against taking the relationship for granted.\n\n\"I came to the United States thinking I understood this country, like many Australians,\" he said.\n\n\"In fact, 1.4 million Australians a year travel here to the United States, mostly to Disneyland, to Wall Street, to Silicon Valley, and like many of the Aussies here I grew up on Sesame Street, Bonanza, Hogan's Heroes and Mad comics,\n\n\"And like others others, our families drove a Ford and had a fondness on occasion for McDonalds. Occasionally . . . more than occasionally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Needless to say, America's influence on the world has been significant. Yet as ambassador, it took time for me to learn that what makes America great - and by the way people, America is great.\n\n\"It was great and it is great and will continue to be great.\"\n\nMr Hockey added that America's strength was its \"extraordinary capacity to make extraordinary people.\n\n\"This nation innovates better than any other country, not only in the world, but in history.\n\n\"It's commercialisation of that innovation separates the wheat from the chaff.\n\n\"Failure happens here in the United States, but it's not the end when you fail; it's just the end of the beginning. You can dust off and start again.\n\n\"Americans give more substance to the term 'having a go' than any other nation on earth. From this we can learn,\" he said.\n\nMr Hockey joked that the differences between the two countries included the US objection to swearing. \"I've learnt that, especially on the third tee with Donald Trump.\n\n\"And they are very respectful of office and title. So the good news is that I'm ambassador-for-life.\"\n\nHe finished by warning that America's strength's of patriotism, respect, freedom and hope were \"all under extreme pressure in a world that is increasingly fraught\".\n\n\"The danger for Australians is that we can be too casual about our relationship with the United States of America,\" Mr Hockey said.", "description": "The Ambassador to the US has cautioned Australians and Americans against complacency in a world seemingly sliding away from democracy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_44%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cf944f88e291da86bd741933f31558826630e666", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
