Biden, Sen. Cory Booker, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, Sen. Bernard Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.\n\nThe number of candidates participating was cut in half compared to the DNC\u2019s first two debates in June and July. Those two-day events featured a total of 20 candidates each time, with 10 participating on each night.\n\nTo qualify for the September debate, candidates had to secure contributions from 130,000 individual donors and hit 2% or more in four qualifying polls.\n\nThose were more stringent metrics than the DNC used for the first two debates, when candidates had to amass 65,000 contributions or hit 1% in three polls.\n\nSome of the candidates left off the stage have griped about the requirements but vowed to press on in their campaigns.\n\nBut Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand dropped out of the race Wednesday, following the recent departures of Rep. Seth Moulton and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee.\n\nThe same stepped-up polling and fundraising requirements will be used to determine who qualifies for the DNC\u2019s October debate, which gives candidates who were on the cusp of making it a few more weeks to get onstage.\n\nBillionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, and author Marianne Williamson all hit the 130,000-donor threshold, according to their campaigns, but fell short of the polling requirements.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
