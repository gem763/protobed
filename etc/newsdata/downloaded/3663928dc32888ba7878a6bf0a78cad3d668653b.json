Architects are taking a deeper look at the country\u2019s origins, local culture and history, and traditional architectural concepts and are incorporating them into contemporary designs.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ms. Casanovas, there\u2019s also been a shift from \u201cgrandiose, to simple but functional.\u201d As the city grows, there is a new focus on masterplanning, walkability, co-working spaces, and public spaces like skate parks. This sentiment was echoed by architects Gordon Gill and Robert Forest from the firm Adrian Smith and Gordon Gill, who have done many projects in Dubai and are currently working on two for Expo 2020, a world\u2019s fair starting next October, including the Al Wasl Pavillion.\n\n\u201cAs the city expands, it becomes focused on becoming more holistic,\u201d Mr. Forest said. Instead of simply being about the name or the height, projects are being constructed to support the way people need to live. They have been working on a project to develop the corridor from the airport to the rest of the city, and have noticed an interest in completing the city.\n\n\u201cThe strategy to fill in the city seems like a big vision,\u201d Mr. Gill said. At the same time, \u201cthe scale is becoming more intimate.\u201d There is much more attention to how people really live, how they go to school and commute to work.\n\nAs the architecture of the city develops, it has also started to shift toward long-term thinking\u2014not just of architectural style, but how the buildings exist in the space in the Gulf, whether it is wind, sun, or local flora and fauna.\n\nBelow are some of the most important architectural marvels in the city, according to experts.", "description": "From the Burj Khalifa to The Opus, a look at some of the city\u2019s most iconic buildings", "authors": ["Ariel Ramchandani"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-120396?size=1.4849187935034802&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
