We produced a great display and didn't win because of fine margins,\u201d Martinez told Inter\u2019s official website.\n\n\u201cNow we have to think about Juventus. We leave here disappointed because we deserved to win.\n\n\u201cWe have to be alert in this competition because players of this calibre are unforgiving if you make a mistake.\n\n\u201cWith all the good work that we did, we didn't deserve to lose. The referee also played a role, but we have to be more focused.\n\n\u201cI do think we produced a very good performance and we can be pleased with that albeit disappointed with the result.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nInter\u2019s European frustrations are in contrast to their domestic form, where they sit two points clear at the top of Serie A with six wins from their opening six matches, scoring 13 goals and conceding just two.\n\nNext up for Conte\u2019s side is a huge encounter with second-placed Juventus, champions of Italy for the past eight seasons, at San Siro on Sunday.", "description": "The Argentina forward was keen to look at the positives despite his side falling to a late defeat at Camp Nou", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qobJmmIxtmwteDl664TmLw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.3ICoJRHU4UTJ5gov8hyKw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/8279b4398a557118bcbb44ef19364706", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
