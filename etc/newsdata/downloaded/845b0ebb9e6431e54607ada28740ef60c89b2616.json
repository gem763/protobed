The company's flagship Pixelbook launched in 2017 and didn't really get a follow up last year. Instead the company launched the Pixel Slate, a surface-style tablet-plus-keyboard combo that flopped so hard Google decided to stop making tablets.\n\nSo, meet the new laptop, the Pixelbook Go. Google nailed a unique and interesting laptop design with the original Pixelbook, but this new update more or less looks like a MacBook. The inner deck of the magnesium notebook features a normal keyboard layout, a large trackpad at the bottom, and a strip of speaker grills flanking either side of the keyboard. The details all look like a carefully-traced MacBook layout, with a similar hinge setup for the screen, and a groove cut out of the front edge to lift the lid.\n\nOne big design difference comes the large, ribbed pad on the bottom, which covers the bottom in a grippy surface in lieu of feet.\n\nTwo hardware features of the Pixelbook Go cover some long-requested MacBook additions, and those are a touch screen and a working keyboard that doesn't die at the first sign of dust. Google promised a keyboard that is both comfortable and even more quiet than the original Pixelbook keyboard.\n\nThe display is a 13.3-inch panel and the entire Pixelbook Go weighs just about two pounds and measures 13mm at its widest point. That makes it lighter than the original Pixelbook, but even so, Google stuck a 15-percent larger battery inside the Pixelbook Go. The company promises up to 12 hours of battery life, and with the included charger, the Pixelbook Go can get two hours of battery life with just 20 minutes of charging.\n\nBased on Google's presentation alone, the Pixelbook Go appears to have a headphone jack and two USB-C ports\u2014a limited selection of connectivity, but not unusual in the realm of thin-and-light notebooks (and very MacBook-like). Google hasn't confirmed the Pixelbook Go's specs yet, but leaks ahead of today's event suggest that the laptop will be configurable with Core m3, i5, or i7 processors, 8GB or 16GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of storage. The screen is reportedly an 1080p panel, but leaks suggest it can be configured to a 4K panel.\n\nThe $649 starting price for the Pixelbook Go is notable because the original Pixelbook was designed as a \"premium\" Chromebook with a starting price of $999. Last year's Pixel Slate was also billed as a premium, convertible Chromebook, and that combination didn't prove successful for Google. While $649 is still more expensive than most Chromebooks available today, it's in-line with plenty of high-powered Chromebooks made by manufacturers including Acer, HP, and Dell.\n\nThe Pixelbook Go will be available in \"just black\" and \"not pink\" color schemes. It's available for preorder today from Google's online store starting at $649.\n\nThis story is developing. We'll add more details as they become available.
