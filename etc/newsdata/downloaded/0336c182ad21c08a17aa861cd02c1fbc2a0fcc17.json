With honor. We don\u2019t delight in death like the terrorists do.'\n\nShe later clarified that she believed the raid itself to be 'unquestionably good and necessary' but described Trump's remarks as 'horrifying'.\n\nSmith, who was appointed by Barack Obama, served as ambassador to Qatar from 2014 to 2017.\n\nU.S. officials said Baghdadi's body had been buried at sea, just as Osama bin Laden's was eight years ago.\n\nAccusation: Smith said Trump's description of the special forces raid was 'probably exaggerated' and said the President was 'delighting in death'\n\nVivid: Donald Trump (pictured speaking to police chiefs at a convention in Chicago yesterday) narrated how Baghdadi had died 'whimpering, crying and screaming' in Syria\n\n'The disposal of his remains has been done, is complete and was handled appropriately,' said General Mark Milley.\n\nIn his White House press conference Trump revealed how Baghdadi had gone 'whimpering, crying and screaming' to his death at a compound in northern Syria.\n\n'The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread,' he told the nation.\n\nHe also lavished praise on the dog who chased Baghdadi down a dead-end tunnel where he blew himself up.\n\nYesterday Trump published a picture of the dog on Twitter, hailing the animal as a 'wonderful dog that did such a great job in capturing and killing the leader of ISIS'.\n\nHowever, there are already fears of revenge attacks and security has been tightened at ISIS prisons in northern Syria.\n\nKurdish guards were said to be 'on high alert' yesterday as they prepare for possible riots or attacks on the prison camps.\n\nEliminated: ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured in a propaganda video in April this year) died at a Syrian compound during a raid by U.S. special forces\n\nAftermath: The compound where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died is seen reduced to rubble yesterday after the U.S. special forces raid\n\nBaghdadi had urged his followers to break ISIS fanatics out of prison in the last weeks of his life.\n\nThere are also fears that 'sleeper cells' around the world will carry out reprisals, and Britain and France have both stepped up security.\n\nMore than 10,000 ISIS prisoners are being held in Syria while another camp is home to some 70,000 people, mainly relatives of the extremists.\n\nSmall units of fighters have gone underground since the terror group's territorial defeat in March and have continued to carry out guerrilla-style attacks in the region.\n\nSecurity fears were already heightened after Turkey's invasion of northern Syria caused chaos in the region.\n\nKurdish guards were summoned away from the camps to fend off the Turkish attack and a U.S. official said as many as 100 ISIS prisoners had already escaped.\n\nHowever, Trump quickly insisted that some of the escaped prisoners had already been recaptured.", "description": "Dana Shell Smith (pictured), the former U.S. ambassador to Qatar, accused Donald Trump of 'delighting in death like the terrorist do' with his description of Baghdadi's final moments.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/08/20315916-0-image-a-15_1572338210053.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
