This week the walls started crumbling around some of the top leaders in the business and political worlds. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, famous for being rumpled and lying, got smacked down by a unanimous court decision. WeWork founder Adam Neumann, known for outrageous behavior and wild proclamations about ruling the world, was ousted. And, of course, U.S. President Donald Trump moved ever closer to the possibility of impeachment.\n\nInept male leaders have had an especially good run over the past few years: A reality TV star \u2015 with a track record of business failures and misogyny \u2015 made it to the Oval Office. Male startup founders were showered with billions of dollars for inventing things of dubious value. A judge made it to the Supreme Court by throwing a raging tantrum.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to see some gender, race and class dynamics at work here. Though incompetent leaders have come from all demographics, it\u2019s rare that a woman, a person of color or a working-class anyone gets vaulted into leadership without some track record of competence. Venture capitalists are eager to give money to promising young white men but hold women and minority entrepreneurs to far higher standards. Male politicians get votes based on charm and potential, while female politicians are almost never lauded for those characteristics.\n\nTime may be up for President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

And these men are game to take the big jobs before they\u2019re ready.\n\n\u201cWomen will decline roles until they\u2019re 100% sure they\u2019ve acquired the skills, whereas men will take the role and learn on the job,\u201d said Stapp. \u201cMen are more inclined to learn as they go.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to George W. Bush as a classic example of someone who got way ahead of his skis in terms of capabilities.\n\nCorporate boards of directors may finally be running out of patience with these golden boys, Stapp said. They\u2019ve learned their lesson because of all the recent problems with a few hotshot CEOs. She mentioned the former leader of Uber, Travis Kalanick, and the current CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk. Both men\u2019s troubles are already legendary: \u201cThe sort of erratic charismatic leader with wonderful ideas, but doesn\u2019t balance himself out with business sense,\u201d Stapp said.\n\nNeumann, the WeWork founder, was an exemplar of this kind of leader \u2015 throwing tequila-fueled layoff parties, smoking weed on his private plane, overhyping his spirituality. But as the real estate company prepared to go public, it became increasingly clear that his style wasn\u2019t working out.\n\nThe company\u2019s valuation has plunged from $90 billion to $15 billion. The initial public offering was postponed. Even Neumann\u2019s banker \u2015 the seemingly untouchable silver-haired leader of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon \u2015 is now facing criticism for not seeing, or overlooking, the trainwreck.\n\nStapp said the fact that Neumann stepped down before the company went public is a good sign. \u201cBoards are starting to hold the CEOs and founders more accountable,\u201d she said. (Just on Wednesday, the CEO of e-cigarette company Juul also stepped aside, amidst rising health concerns about vaping.)\n\nStory continues", "description": "Trump facing impeachment, Boris Johnson on the ropes, WeWork's CEO ousted \u2015 is time finally up for bumbling leaders?", "authors": ["Emily Peck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8ZQkiNBWt73Eabz7SFU5ow--~B/aD01NzA7dz05NjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d3a09e426000049000457e2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
