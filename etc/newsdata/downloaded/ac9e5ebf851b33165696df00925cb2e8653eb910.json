Police aren\u2019t sure who pulled the trigger.", "language": "en", "text": "It was just past midnight on Sunday when Brian Mulkeen and two of his colleagues patrolled a neighborhood in the northern Bronx, tasked with ferreting out gang activity.\n\nThe New York police officers brought their patrol car to a stop to question a man in an area known for violence, including recent shootings. The man sprinted away. The officers pursued him, and Mulkeen, joined by his partner, collided with the man.\n\n\u201cA violent struggle on the ground began,\u201d NYPD Chief Terence Monahan said in a Sunday news conference.\n\nIn a vivid summary of body-camera footage, Mulkeen said that \u201che\u2019s reaching for it, he\u2019s reaching for it,\u201d according to Monahan.\n\nThen five gunshots pierced the night. Mulkeen, 33, was shot three times, Monahan said, and five responding officers fired at the suspect. The suspect was killed, the chief said, and Mulkeen was rushed to a hospital, where he died.\n\nAlthough the unidentified suspect\u2019s .32-caliber revolver was recovered, the chief said it was Mulkeen\u2019s service weapon that fired \u2014 suggesting that the suspect may have taken the officer\u2019s gun and shot him with it.\n\n\u201cAt this point, it does not appear that the perpetrator\u2019s gun was the one that fired,\u201d Monahan said. \u201cOfficer Mulkeen\u2019s gun fired five times. At this point, we are not sure who fired Officer Mulkeen\u2019s gun.\u201d\n\nMulkeen joined the force in 2013 and lived in Yorktown Heights with his girlfriend, who is also a police officer, Monahan said.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no worse moment on our job than this. As we stand here this morning, a young man with a bright future who courageously patrolled some of New York City\u2019s toughest streets has tragically lost his life,\u201d Monahan said.\n\nThe 27-year-old suspect had been on probation for a narcotics-related arrest and had a criminal history that included a burglary conviction, the police chief said.\n\nDozens of officers lined up in the dark to give a final salute to Mulkeen, as police motorcycles and ambulances pulled away with flashing red and blue lights.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio (D) hailed Mulkeen as a hero doing \u201ca job that New Yorkers needed him to do.\u201d\n\nMulkeen is the second officer to be killed on duty in New York this year. Detective Brian Simonsen was accidentally killed by another officer in February while responding to a report of armed robbery.\n\nRead more:\n\nSikh deputy killed in \u2018coldblooded\u2019 shooting after making history in Texas, sheriff says\n\nLAPD recruitment ad on Breitbart was so bewildering that the chief wondered if it was a fake", "description": "New York officials hailed Brian Mulkeen as a hero after he was killed chasing a suspect early Sunday.", "authors": ["Alex Horton", "General Assignment Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "September At Pm", "Alex Horton Is A General Assignment Reporter For The Washington Post.
