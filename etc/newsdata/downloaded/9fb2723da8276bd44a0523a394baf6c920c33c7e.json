I\u2019ve had the whole house checked by a professional who looks for things like EMF waves and things like that.\u201d\n\nFor context, the radiation emitted from mobile devices is minimal, so it sounds like the tech-guys were poking fun at Miranda\u2019s paranoia, which didn\u2019t sit well with her husband.\n\n\u201cYou trying to shame my wife in an interview?\u201d he asked defensively.\u201dI haven\u2019t had an opportunity to look into it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to support your partner and everything they believe,\u201d Spiegel said, which seems like an appropriate response. Miranda\u2019s paranoia may seem silly now, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with being extra cautious. Let the woman live her damn life.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we make a deal,\u201d Spiegel said. \u201cI won\u2019t make fun of your wife on stage, and you won\u2019t make fun of mine.\u201d\n\nThe Aussie supermodel-turned-beauty mogul isn\u2019t alone in her theories about electromagnetic fields causing health problems, however, the science isn\u2019t exactly on her side.\n\nAccording to the Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, there is \u201cno established evidence\u201d that low level electromagnetic fields can be dangerous to your health. While there are some studies that may support the theory, but a large majority of studies seem to debunk the theory.\n\nCelebrities have some weird beliefs, just look at Gwyneth Paltrow, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to shame someone for the safety measures they take within their own homes and lives. If Miranda was using her platform to sell EMF-detecting products, it\u2019d be a different story, but she\u2019s just living her own life here.\n\nGranted, you\u2019d think her super-tech-genius husband would be able to show her the facts and clear up this mess, but maybe he\u2019s just happy for his wife to have her own beliefs. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\n\nHonestly, if EMF-detecting devices are what makes Miranda Kerr look like that, maybe I\u2019ll invest in some too.", "description": "Snap founder and CEO Evan Spiegel has supported his wife after an interviewer mocked her extensive use of anti-EMF devices, despite a lack of research.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1057226672.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
