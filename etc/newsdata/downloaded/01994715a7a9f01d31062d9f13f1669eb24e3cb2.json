I don\u2019t think this is right. If the only thing the Labour leader cared about was leaving the EU, it would have happened by now.\n\nCorbyn may be a longstanding Eurosceptic, but that is not the reason he engineered today\u2019s fudge at Labour\u2019s national executive committee meeting. I suspect that he cares much more about getting to No 10, and that Seumas Milne, his director of strategy, thinks that emphatic support for another referendum would make it harder for Labour to get into government.\n\nCorbyn backed Remain in the 2016 referendum, after all, because it was in his political interest to do so. He was unenthusiastic about it, just as he is unenthusiastic about a second referendum now \u2013 because he is trying to hold together a coalition of Remain and Leave voters.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn that respect, today\u2019s NEC decision was admirably clear. \u201cLabour is the only party which represents both people who supported Leave and Remain,\u201d said a party spokesperson. In other words, the party wants to keep the votes of Leave supporters and Tom Watson, the deputy leader, has lost the argument.\n\nWe can deduce from all this that Milne calculates a definite promise of a new referendum would lose the party more Leave voters than it would gain Remain voters from Change UK, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and the Scottish and Welsh nationalists.\n\nI suspect this judgement is right. If Labour became explicitly the Remain party, the gains from the other Remain parties would be small. After all, how many voters are holding back from voting Labour because it is not pro-EU enough \u2013 and if they feel that way, wouldn\u2019t they be happier voting for a truly pro-EU party anyway?\n\nOn the other hand, an explicit policy of trying to cancel Brexit could easily put off voters who took the party at its word when it said it respected the result of the referendum, and who imagine that it is sincere in its negotiations to agree a \u201cjobs-first Brexit\u201d deal with the government.\n\nThat is why I think Milne and Corbyn resisted the explicit promise of another referendum on any Brexit deal. They think today\u2019s fudge will maximise the Labour vote in the local elections on Thursday and in the European elections in three weeks\u2019 time.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

To support something being a possibility? That means very little, so the spokesperson was quite right to say it is \u201cfully in line with Labour\u2019s existing policy\u201d.\n\nIt was the first line of the spokesperson\u2019s statement that gave the game away: \u201cWe are working to bring the country together after the chaos and crisis created by the Tories.\u201d\n\nTo translate that into normal English: we hope that both Leavers and Remainers will continue to vote for us, while the Conservative Party goes into meltdown for its failure to deliver Brexit.\n\nSo far, the Milne-Corbyn strategy seems to be working fine.", "description": "Many Remainers accuse Jeremy Corbyn of resisting a clear promise of a new referendum because he is trying to get Britain out of the EU.
