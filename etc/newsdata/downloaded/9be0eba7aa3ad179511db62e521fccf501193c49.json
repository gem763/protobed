Notes 14,000 'Grave Violations' Against Afghan Kids", "language": "en", "text": "(UNITED NATIONS) \u2014 Deteriorating security across Afghanistan in the past four years led to over 14,000 \u201cgrave violations\u201d against children, including nearly 3,500 youngsters killed and over 9,000 injured, according to a U.N. report circulated Thursday.\n\nSecretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned \u201cthe alarming level\u201d of grave violations committed by all parties and the fact that children \u201ccontinue to bear the brunt of the armed conflict.\u201d\n\nOf serious concern, he said, is that the nearly 12,600 children verified to have been killed or injured in 2015-2018 represented almost a third of all civilian casualties. That was \u201can increase of 82 percent in child casualties compared with the previous four years,\u201d he wrote.\n\nGuterres said in his fourth report on children and armed conflict in Afghanistan that the rise was traced to \u201can increase in child casualties resulting from ground engagements, explosive remnants of war and aerial attacks.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The U.N. verified 1,049 child casualties from airstrikes in 2015-2018, including 464 youngsters killed. That represented 40% of civilian casualties from aerial attacks, the report said.\n\nGuterres said armed groups were responsible for 43% of child casualties _ 3,450 killed and 9,149 injured. While Taliban fighters were responsible for the majority, the number attributed to the Islamic State extremist group increased overall during the four-year period, he said.\n\nGovernment and pro-government forces were responsible for 30% of child casualties, he said.\n\nGuterres said the U.N. also verified the recruitment and use of 274 children by armed groups and government forces, sexual violence against 13 boys and four girls, and 467 attacks on schools and education personnel.\n\nThe secretary-general said the actual number of children recruited and used in the Afghan conflict \u201cis estimated to be much higher,\u201d citing as an example allegations in 2016 that over 3,000 children were recruited, mainly by armed groups.\n\nSimilarly, Guterres said rape and other forms of sexual violence against children \u201cis known to be underreported as a result of prevailing social norms, fear of retaliation and impunity.\u201d\n\nIn a study by the U.N. political mission in Afghanistan between October 2016 and December 2017, he said, people in communities across Afghanistan \u201cshared their perceptions that the use of boys for the purposes of sexual abuse and exploitation, including bacha bazi, by parties to conflict was common and widespread.\u201d Bacha bazi is a practice in which wealthy or powerful men exploit boys for entertainment, especially dancing and sexual activities.\n\nGuterres cited the case of a boy in Takhar province who was held for about a year by several armed commanders, including national police commanders, \u201cand used for bacha bazi.\u201d\n\nIn an overview of political and security developments in 2015-2018, the secretary-general said the situation deteriorated compared to the previous four years, \u201cnotably following the transfer of responsibility for security from international forces to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces in 2014.\u201d The following year, he said, the Taliban made \u201csignificant territorial inroads.\u201d\n\nGuterres said in recent months, 45,000 to 65,000 Taliban fighters were reportedly active in Afghanistan \u201calthough estimates vary considerably.\u201d He added that \u201cthe Haqqani network has assumed an increasingly influential role in the Taliban\u2019s military operations.\u201d\n\nThe secretary-general said al-Qaida \u201cis believed to maintain a limited presence in eastern Afghanistan\u201d while the Islamic State extremist group is also present in eastern Afghanistan, \u201cwith 2,500 to 4,000 elements believed to be currently active.\u201d\n\nOperations by Afghan and international forces have constrained the Islamic State group\u2019s expansion, Guterres said, and as a result IS has \u201cincreasingly relied on suicide and complex attacks deliberately targeting civilians in large cities.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Deteriorating security in Afghanistan over the past four years led to nearly 3,500 kids killed and over 9,000 injured, according to the U.N.", "authors": ["Edith M.
