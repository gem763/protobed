U.S. WTI crude oil CLc1 was down 23 cents at $53.13.\n\nU.S. crude inventories soared by 10.5 million barrels to 432.5 million barrels in the week to Oct. 11, the American Petroleum Institute\u2019s weekly report showed ahead of official government stocks data due on Thursday.[API/S]\n\nAnalysts had estimated U.S. crude inventories rose by around 2.8 million barrels last week.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy is scheduled to publish the official inventory data on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. sanctions imposed on the Chinese shipping company COSCO are seriously denting demand for imported crude oil... This has a profound impact on U.S. crude oil inventories as reflected in last night\u2019s API report,\u201d said Tamas Varga, an analyst at PVM Oil Associates.\n\n\u201cU.S. refinery maintenance is not helping to reverse the current trend and further builds in U.S. crude oil inventories can be expected in the next few weeks.\u201d\n\nThe United States imposed sanctions on COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Co and subsidiary COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman & Ship Management Co for allegedly carrying Iranian crude oil.\n\nAdding to concerns about the global economy - and therefore oil demand - data from the United States showed retail sales in September fell for the first time in seven months. Earlier data showed a moderation in job growth and services sector activity.\n\nStill, the new Brexit deal helped limit the fall in oil prices. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that Britain and the EU had agreed a \u201cgreat\u201d new Brexit deal and urged lawmakers to approve it at the weekend.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker also said Britain and the EU had agreed a deal.\n\nHowever, the Northern Irish party Johnson needs to help ratify any agreement has refused to support the deal.\n\nHopes of a potential U.S.-China trade deal also supported crude prices. China\u2019s commerce ministry said on Thursday that China hoped to reach a phased agreement with Washington as early as possible, and make progress on cancelling tariffs on each others\u2019 goods.", "description": "Oil prices fell on Thursday as industry data showed a larger-than-expected build-up in U.S. inventories but losses were limited after the United Kingdom and the European Union announced they had reached a deal on Brexit.", "authors": ["Bozorgmehr Sharafedin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441720580&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G02S", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
