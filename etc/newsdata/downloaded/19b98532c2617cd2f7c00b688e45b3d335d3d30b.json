But that is exactly what the Democrats want to do. They are willing to hurt the Country, with only the 2020 Election in mind! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019\n\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and Nasdaq composite index were also down at least 1.5 percent.\n\nStill, the anxiety on Wall Street wasn\u2019t necessarily pinned to one particular turn of events. Rather, continued impeachment drama in the White House has done little to ease investors\u2019 worries about a recession. And even as markets are frequently jolted by President Trump\u2019s unpredictable trade policies, he recently said that he is under no immediate time pressure to reach a trade deal with China.\n\nU.S. can impose tariffs on $7.5 billion in goods because E.U. gave illegal subsidies to Airbus, WTO rules\n\nStill, a new report Wednesday from ADP and Moody\u2019s Analytics found that the private sector created more jobs than expected in September, even while the pace slowed alongside concerns of a tight labor market.\n\nAD\n\nCompanies hired 135,000 more workers in September, according to the jobs report, topping the 125,000 that economists surveyed by the Dow Jones had expected. But the September figure was the slowest since June and brought the 2019 monthly average down to 145,000 \u2014 markedly down from the 214,000 for the same period last year. The September numbers were also down from August\u2019s 157,000.\n\nAD\n\nAmerican consumers are increasingly propping up the global economy, but there are concerns that that confidence could begin to slip. U.S. vehicle sales for Ford Motor declined 4.9 percent during the third quarter, the company said Wednesday, with demand for the top-selling F-series pickup starting to slouch. The company\u2019s stock was down nearly 3 percent Wednesday morning.\n\nThe National Retail Federation is set to issue its holiday season forecast Thursday.\n\nAD\n\nTuesday\u2019s manufacturing news erased hopes of a quick turnaround for the industry and bruised Trump\u2019s vows to revive American blue-collar jobs. Manufacturing fell into a \u201ctechnical recession\u201d in the first half of the year, and the latest ISM data suggests that situation is only growing more grave.\n\nMeanwhile, economists are growing more concerned that the slump in manufacturing could have ripple effects for the rest of the U.S. economy, even as some industries are already feeling the sting of Trump\u2019s trade war. Hiring cooled in August, and Wall Street is frequently riled by Trump\u2019s sudden pronouncements around global trade.\n\nAD\n\nFor the first time, most new working-age hires in the U.S. are people of color\n\n\u201cThere is no end in sight to this slowdown, the recession risk is real,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, in an email to clients Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nThe European markets were on a downturn, with the FTSE down nearly 200 points, or 2.6 percent, and the DAX down 230 points, or 1.9 percent. The S&P 500 was also 30 points in the red.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the World Trade Organization downgraded its forecast for global trade growth for this year and next. The U.S.-China trade war and a global economic slowdown spurred economists to project that world merchandise trade volume is expected to rise 1.2 percent in 2019 \u2014 markedly slower than the 2.6 percent forecast in April. For 2020, the forecast estimates 2.7 percent growth instead of 3 percent.\n\nThe cut forecast came mere weeks after Trump called China a \u201cthreat to the world\u201d and said there was little urgency for an interim trade agreement. On Sept. 20, he told reporters he was under no pressure to reach a deal with China before the 2020 election, despite his early insistence that China was eager to return to the negotiation table.\n\nAD", "description": "In a tweet midday Wednesday, President Trump blamed the stock market\u2019s downturn on \u201call of this impeachment nonsense, which is going nowhere.\u201d", "authors": ["Rachel Siegel", "National Business Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/I34z_TK-CB3qx550G4UC0OHg-Jk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CAPUQFHE3MI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
