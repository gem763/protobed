We thought there could be up to eight, so roughly calculated an eight-hour labour,\u201d Ms Barrett said.\n\n\u201cBut after seven were born in just 40 minutes, we were absolutely gobsmacked. They were just flying out.\u201d\n\nDuring the delivery, one of the puppies became trapped in the birth canal by the mother\u2019s placenta, which had come loose.\n\nBy the time Ms Barrett and her sister, Alice, got the puppy out after 40 minutes, it wasn\u2019t breathing or moving.\n\n\u201cWe were all panicking, we thought we had lost her. It took about 10 to 15 minutes to get her breathing,\u201d the owner stated, explaining she used suction equipment to suck the fluid out of the puppy\u2019s lungs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good job I\u2019d done my reading on the subject, or she wouldn\u2019t be here now.\u201d\n\nThe puppy in question, who is now the biggest in the litter, was named \u201cHope\u201d in honour of her delivery.\n\nThe litter consists of seven boys and six girls, all of which have been named after their distinct personalities.\n\n\u201cStormy was the runt of the litter so we gave him a strong name to give him a boost,\u201d Ms Barrett said.\n\n\u201cPenelope used to snort a lot so we named her after the film character. Another pup used to howl like she was trying to sing, so we called her Paloma Faith.\u201d\n\nMs Barrett has been getting up in the middle of the night to feed the runts of the litter, as Beau only has 10 teats for 13 puppies.\n\nThe dog breeder added that delivering the huge litter of puppies was the \u201cmost beautiful\u201d thing she has ever done.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
