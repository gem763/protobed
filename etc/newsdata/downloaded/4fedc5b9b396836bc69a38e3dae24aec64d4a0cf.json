Earlier in the day, the shares hit an intraday all-time low of $28.65.\n\nLyft also fell sharply, ending the day down 3.1% to $39.57, compared to its previous low of $40.84 on Sept. 30. The stock dropped as low as $38.68 on Tuesday, touching a new intraday low.\n\nUber, which had a private valuation of $76 billion ahead of its IPO in May, has seen its valuation drop steeply as its stock price has dwindled. The company now has a market cap of roughly $49 billion.\n\nSimilarly, Lyft's market cap is hovering around $11.6 billion, compared to its last private valuation of roughly $15 billion.\n\nThe companies are just a two examples of this year's struggling tech IPO class.
