Most people are now well aware of the therapeutic benefits of the cannabis plant and its cousin hemp. Investors are certainly aware of the massive industry unfolding.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, cannabis operations have moved from the back alley to the boardroom and innovation is thriving. The perfect storm of booming demand for product and operational efficiency has led to a proliferation of automated technology throughout the supply chain.\n\nFor JackSam Corp. (OTCQB: JKSM), which does business under the moniker Convectium, this is the perfect environment to continue roll-out of its disruptive automated solution suite that fills, caps and packages THC and CBD concentrates 60-times faster than antiquated manual methods that still dominate the market.\n\nClick here to see the company investor presentation\n\nFor SinglePoint, Inc. (OTCQB: SING), a diversified holding firm with portfolio companies in cannabis, hemp, digital payments and solar, taking a piece of Convectium in 2017 was an investment that keeps on giving. In March 2017, SinglePoint made an $800,000 cash-and-stock investment for 10% of then-privately held Convectium.\n\nClick here to see the company corporate presentation\n\nSinglePoint still holds 6.0% of JKSM outstanding stock.\n\nThe Biggest Thing Since the Dotcom Boom\n\nVilified for decades, cannabis is now being trumpeted as a serious medical breakthrough.\n\nCannabis cannabinoids can be found in more than 1,000 products, ranging from edibles to beverages to pet products to skin creams. These cannabinoids generally consist of CBD (cannabidiol), a non-intoxicating component of cannabis and hemp, and THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the part of cannabis responsible for the psychoactive \"high\" often associated with marijuana.\n\nThe world is recognizing the medical benefits (and lack of side effects) of CBD. Hemp, which became legal across the U.S. at the start of 2019 through the passage of the Farm Bill, is defined as cannabis sativa containing less than 0.3% THC. In January 2018, the World Doping Agency removed CBD from its banned substance list, further validating its efficacy and safety.\n\n33 U.S. states have legalized cannabis for medical uses, while 10 states and Washington, D.C. allow recreational uses. Last October, Canada legalized marijuana for all adults but products have been limited. Modified legislation will open the Canadian markets to a variety of new cannabis products, including extracts. That means that about 260 million people in North America has access to cannabis in one form or another.\n\nTo that end, it's no surprise that the industry experts at Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics are calling for the legal cannabis market in the U.S. alone to reach $22.2 billion in 2022.\n\nLeading the growth is concentrates, which, according to the BDS's GreenEdge have experienced 22.1% compound annual growth across 2014-2018 to now make up one-third of the total cannabis market. A deeper dive shows the cannabis oil market segment is surging, forecast to grow at a stunning 46.9% CAGR from 2019-2025 to reach $2.16 billion.\n\nRunning Circles Around Competition\n\nConvectium is the inventor of the world's first cannabis oil filling system and proprietary packaging systems. This is a major advancement at a time when about 80% of all concentrate products (vapes and pods) are filled manually. By hand, oil cartridge fills are completed at a paltry 75 per hour. Convectium's 710 Shark system can exceed that in less than a minute on its way to produce between 6,000-12,000 in an hour.\n\nCannot view this image?
