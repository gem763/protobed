There\u2019s unauthorised rooftop bars popping up in Melbourne before getting served with copyright infringement. There\u2019s ~magical lunches~ held in Great Hall-like venues. There\u2019s unofficial Halloween costumes called, like, Bespectacled Teen Wizard Outfit. And now, folks, there\u2019s a Harry Potter-themed burlesque strip show coming to town.\n\nThat\u2019s right, if you like Harry Potter but you also like naked people, then this is the night out for you. I\u2019m guessing JK Rowling isn\u2019t really into this combination of things, so frankly I\u2019m shocked that it\u2019s still going ahead given Warner Bros\u2019 history of shutting this stuff down.\n\nCalled The Philosopher\u2019s Strip, the show has apparently enjoyed successful runs at Sydney\u2019s Oxford Art Factory and Melbourne\u2019s Imperial Hotel (the home of the aforementioned rooftop bar), and now it\u2019s coming back to Syd for a one-off show at Darling Harbour\u2019s Home the Venue this Sunday, Sep 29.\n\nThe show apparently involves, according to the press release: \u201ca magical display of burlesque, dance, acrobatics, aerial, voguing, singing and a soundtrack that will make your cupboard under the stairs shake including a banging Hogwarts remix supplied by KLP.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE Should You Leave Your Partner If They Hate Harry Potter? An Investigation\n\nIf that raises your wand, you can pick up tickets HERE, where the show is described somewhat confusingly as:\n\nWands at the ready, witches! It\u2019s time to party like it\u2019s 1997. Robe up, butter your beer and prepare yourself for the magical rave of a lifetime as we undress The Boy Who Lived! Part circus, part burlesque, part cabaret\u2026 full Harry Potter DANCE PARTY. NOTE: this is absolutely NOT a show about He Who Must Not Be Named, the baby with the scar, or that school we all wish we went to. Srsly tho. Where was my letter?\n\nI\u2019m not sure that last note is enough to avoid the wrath of JK Rowling and Warner Bros., but ten points to Gryffindor for trying.", "description": "Harry Potter themed events are popping up everywhere -- but The Philosopher's Strip burlesque is probably the first non-clothed one of its kind.", "authors": ["Josephine Rozenberg-Clarke"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/harry-fb-1024x538.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
