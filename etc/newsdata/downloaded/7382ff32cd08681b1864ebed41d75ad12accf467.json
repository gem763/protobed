CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto reported yesterday that the CIA was forced to exfiltrate a mole deep within the Kremlin after Trump revealed too much intelligence in a one-on-one meeting with Vladimir Putin in 2017. The loss of this asset meant that Trump had essentially blinded the CIA just at a time when Russian aggression had escalated.\n\nSounds damning \u2014 except that wasn\u2019t how it happened at all, both the New York Times and Washington Post report this morning. The exposure of the asset didn\u2019t come from Trump, but instead from media reporting on Russian election interference from intel sources that revealed enough to put the asset at risk. The Post explicitly rejects Sciutto\u2019s conclusions:\n\nThe exfiltration took place sometime after an Oval Office meeting in May 2017, when President Trump revealed highly classified counterterrorism information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador, said the current and former officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive operation. That disclosure alarmed U.S. national security officials, but it was not the reason for the decision to remove the CIA asset, who had provided information to the United States for more than a decade, according to the current and former officials.\n\nWe\u2019ll get back to the Post\u2019s account, but the NYT corroborated the point, albeit a bit more ambiguously in regard to Trump:\n\nAs American officials began to realize that Russia was trying to sabotage the 2016 presidential election, the informant became one of the C.I.A.\u2019s most important \u2014 and highly protected \u2014 assets. But when intelligence officials revealed the severity of Russia\u2019s election interference with unusual detail later that year, the news media picked up on details about the C.I.A.\u2019s Kremlin sources. C.I.A. officials worried about safety made the arduous decision in late 2016 to offer to extract the source from Russia. The situation grew more tense when the informant at first refused, citing family concerns \u2014 prompting consternation at C.I.A. headquarters and sowing doubts among some American counterintelligence officials about the informant\u2019s trustworthiness. But the C.I.A. pressed again months later after more media inquiries. This time, the informant agreed. The move brought to an end the career of one of the C.I.A.\u2019s most important sources. It also effectively blinded American intelligence officials to the view from inside Russia as they sought clues about Kremlin interference in the 2018 midterm elections and next year\u2019s presidential contest.\n\nIt takes a while in the NYT report to get to CNN\u2019s mistake:\n\nThe decision to extract the informant was driven \u201cin part\u201d because of concerns that Mr. Trump and his administration had mishandled delicate intelligence, CNN reported. But former intelligence officials said there was no public evidence that Mr. Trump directly endangered the source, and other current American officials insisted that media scrutiny of the agency\u2019s sources alone was the impetus for the extraction.\n\nThat may not be entirely true, either. Returning to the Post\u2019s account, presidential action may have been the catalyst for the need to exfiltrate the asset. However, CNN chose the wrong president:\n\nIn January 2017, the Obama administration published a detailed assessment that unambiguously laid the blame on the Kremlin, concluding that \u201cPutin ordered an influence campaign\u201d and that Russia\u2019s goal was to undermine faith in the U.S. democratic process and harm Clinton\u2019s chances of winning. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty remarkable intelligence community product \u2014 much more specific than what you normally see,\u201d one U.S. official said. \u201cIt\u2019s very expected that potential U.S. intelligence assets in Russia would be under a higher level of scrutiny by their own intelligence services.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s quite likely,\u201d the official continued, \u201cthat the U.S. intelligence community would already be taking a hard look at extracting any U.S. assets who would have been subject to increased levels of scrutiny\u201d after the assessment\u2019s publication. Part of it relied on communications intercepts and human intelligence, the official said. The Russians \u201cundoubtedly would have been conducting a review as to who within Putin\u2019s inner circle would have had access to the information.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the Obama administration was reeling from the voters\u2019 rebuke in the 2016 election and had lots of reasons to pull a dog-in-the-manger ploy with Trump. That impulse led to this release of intelligence by the White House, which as the Post notes provided a road map back to those potential sources. Within a month, the NYT notes, both they, NBC, and the Washington Post had uncovered enough about the source to expose his identity:\n\nNews agencies, including NBC, began reporting around that time about Mr. Putin\u2019s involvement in the election sabotage and on the C.I.A.\u2019s possible sources for the assessment.\n\nKnowing how Putin deals with dissenters, let alone moles, the CIA would have been very, very motivated to protect its source and show that it can protect future sources as well. It was at that point, not in May 2017 at the Trump-Putin Oval Office meeting, that the CIA updated its exfiltration plans and worked to get their source out of Russia. The exfiltration itself took place the following month, but it had been in the works for months.\n\nNeedless to say, the CIA was not amused by the CNN report:\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency on Monday evening slammed what it called CNN\u2019s \u201cmisguided\u201d and \u201csimply false\u201d reporting, after the cable channel\u2019s chief national security correspondent authored a hole-filled piece claiming that the CIA had pulled a high-level spy out of Russia because President Trump had \u201crepeatedly mishandled classified intelligence and could contribute to exposing the covert source as a spy.\u201d The extraordinary CIA rebuke came as The New York Times published a bombshell piece late in the evening, which largely contradicted CNN\u2019s reporting. According to the Times, CIA officials \u201cmade the arduous decision in late 2016 to offer to extract the source from Russia\u201d \u2014 weeks before Trump even took office. \u2026 \u201cCNN\u2019s narrative that the Central Intelligence Agency makes life-or-death decisions based on anything other than objective analysis and sound collection is simply false,\u201d CIA Director for Public Affairs Brittany Bramell said in the agency\u2019s statement. Bramwell continued: \u201cMisguided speculation that the President\u2019s handling of our nation\u2019s most sensitive intelligence \u2014 which he has access to each and every day \u2014 drove an alleged exfiltration operation is inaccurate.\u201d\n\nOne has to wonder whether CNN\u2019s sources are the same people that decided to rush out the intel assessment in January 2017 in order to paint Trump as illegitimate. After all, former ODNI James Clapper works for CNN as a contributor. Couldn\u2019t he have cleared this up for Sciutto before it went on the air \u2014 or did he participate in its dissemination?\n\nUpdate: Speaking of irresponsible media reporting, here\u2019s NBC News:\n\nA former senior Russian official is living in the Washington area under U.S. government protection, current and former government officials tell NBC News. \u2026 [T]he former Russian government official, who had a job with access to secrets, was living openly under his true name. An NBC News correspondent went to the man\u2019s house in the Washington area and rang the doorbell. Five minutes later, two young men in an SUV came racing up the street and parked immediately adjacent to the correspondent\u2019s car. The men, who identified themselves only as friends of the Russian, asked the correspondent what he was doing there. A former senior national security official said the men were likely U.S. government agents monitoring the Russian\u2019s house.\n\nGee, ya think? It\u2019s been almost exactly 18 months since Sergei Skripal almost got rubbed out by Russian hit men using a weapon of mass destruction that contaminated a British town. Are reporters trying to get this man killed? What was the point of going to his door, especially ostentatiously enough that it drew attention?", "description": "But was Obama?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/brennan-clapper.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
