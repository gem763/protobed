So imagine the desire that pumps in the hearts of thousands of men, and women, when they come face to face with the new Legend 50, or the Hilux GR Sport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GR Sport has an enlarged, honeycomb front grille with distinctive Toyota lettering (akin to the Dakar race vehicle) and a gloss-black finish, and a GR badge. The vertical fog-light garnish features a red or white outline (dependent on exterior colour), all models have a black bonnet and roof. Black accents are extended to the side mirrors, GR-branded tubular side steps, over-fenders and GR-Sport specific 17\u201d alloy wheels wrapped in 265-65-R17 tyres.\n\n\n\nInside there's a unique interior, with red accents and a black leather interior which features red contrast stitching and GR logos embroidered on the headrests and carpets. A GR-branded start button just stands out and is thrilling to push every single time you start the bakkie. Each Hilux GR Sport includes a branded production plate and serial number.\n\n\n\nBut it's the Hilux GR\u2019s bespoke Gazoo Racing uprated and tuned suspension that makes me fall helplessly in love and makes this bakkie's driving dynamics top class. The shock absorbers here feature a monotube design with revised damping, working in conjunction with increased front spring rates to offer a sportier ride without even upsetting ride comfort for driver or passengers. It's handling and driving dynamics are incredible and it just absorbs any bumps or potholes like a sponge. The rear leaf spring rates have been left unaltered. The GR Sport almost drives like a sporty SUV, yet it's tougher than anything else. It can work hard and is incredibly comfortable at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe front upper and lower grille has full black-out treatment (in gloss), with matching fog-light surrounds, along with silver accents and a silver lower bumper guard. The Legend 50 badging is offset to the left complementing the LED headlights with daytime running lights (DRL).\n\n\n\nThere are black side protective mouldings, chrome mirrors and door handles and black side steps. There's also a customised rear styling bar with matching Legend 50 badging and a heavy-duty tonneau cover, along with satin-silver roof rails.\n\n\n\nThe rear sports a black rear bumper, smoked taillights and tailgate badging, and a low-profile towbar is fitted as standard. There are also Legend 50-specific two-tone 18\u201d rims wrapped in 265-60-R18 all-terrain tyres.\n\n\n\nThe interior is inviting and surprisingly comfortable. It features black leather trim (on X/C and D/C) with blue perforation and stitching, a chrome accent strip, branded silver door scuff plates, and carpet set.\n\n\n\nProbably the most surprising highlight for me was the fuel efficiency of this bakkie. I was expecting more than 10-litres/100km but we averaged 8.6-litres/100km on a good day. Performance and driving dynamics are what you would expect from a Hilux - bladdy good of course. And since there are no engine enhancements on this model, its where the GR Sport could trump the Legend 50 because of its magnificent suspension system.\n\n\n\nThe instrument cluster has white-faced dials with orange needles and a cog-shaped motif, a 4.2\u201d TFT Multi-information Display with steering wheel control.\n\n\n\nToyota says the Legend 50 package has been applied to 100% of Raider models across all three body shapes (Single-, Xtra- and Double Cab). All S/C and X/C Legend 50 models are powered by the 2.8 GD-6 engine delivering 130kW/420Nm (450Nm on Auto models). These can be paired with both 4x2 (Raised Body) or 4x4 drivetrains.\n\n\n\nDouble Cab Legend 50 models are available with either the 2.8 GD-6 or 4.0 V6 (exclusively 4x4 auto) powertrain, whilst the diesels can be had in either 4x2 or 4x4 configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Toyota has two mega Hilux bakkies that could make any grown bakkie-loving fan absolutely weak in the news.
