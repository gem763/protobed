He was sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nDeForest-Davis has been sentenced to a suspended sentence of 180 days in prison, together with 200 hours of community service and two years of supervised probation.\n\nAccording to a Justice Department spokesperson, DeForest-Davis has also been ordered to \u201cstay away from [Hassan\u2019s] office to include current and former staff, and to not use Tor or anonymized computer applications.\u201d\n\nCourt House News reported that the sentence showed \u201cleniency\u201d from the federal judge who imposed it.\n\nDeForest-Davis initially lied to the police, telling them that she knew nothing about Cosko\u2019s actions.\n\nIn fact, the staffer provided Cosko with keys to the office of Sen. Hassan, allowing him to break in and hack into congressional computers. Cosko used this access to obtain and publish the home addresses of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), and former Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT).\n\nDeForest-Davis also admitted to wiping down Senate computers in an attempt to remove Cosko\u2019s fingerprints.\n\nProsecutors recommended a sentence of six months of house arrest and five years of probation, or 600 hours of community service if the judge opted against house arrest.\n\nInstead, the judge handed down the more lenient sentence of 200 hours of community service and 2 years supervised probation.\n\n\u201cThis sentence really is meant to help you,\u201d said the Reagan-appointed judge, addressing DeForest-Davis in court.\n\nAre you an insider at Reddit or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
