As it is, the Constitution does make provisions for land redistribution.\u201d\n\nREAD: 200 years. R600bn. And that\u2019s just what it will take for current land claims\n\n\n\nMbabama said the issue was not in the need for the amendment of the Constitution but lay in the hands of the current ruling party and its failure to redistribute land in all its time in power.\n\nRT @JKwritingz: @AdvDali_Mpofu: What we need is to transfer all the land to the state and then have the state as a mechanism transfer the land to South Africans. Transferring on an individual basis will never work.

He said that, not only was there a need to amend the Constitution, but it should go as far as \u201cthe state being the custodian of all the land and later redistribute it accordingly to all South Africans, black, white, tall, short, fat or skinny\u201d.\n\nMbabama argued that adopting such a model of land redistribution would come at a great risk.\n\nImagine the current government being entrusted with the country\u2019s entire land. Already it is battling with so many accusations of state capture. On top of this we should entrust it with our land Thandeka Mbabama, from the DA\n\nUnited Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa also weighed in, saying all this talk of land expropriation was just scaring many South Africans because he did not see it amounting to anything.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to stop scaring South Africans, there will not be any amendment of the Constitution because the two main parties [the ANC and the EFF] who could vote together to make this possible don\u2019t see eye to eye on the merits of land expropriation,\u201d argued Holomisa. He said his party was in favour of land expropriation but was against the amendment of the Constitution.\n\nMpofu, however, argued that the only scaremongering that was happening was with regards to the EFF\u2019s stance on the issue of land expropriation.\n\n\n\nThe EFF is a party that has said let us change the Constitution. The party has not resorted to taking arms and taking land forcefully so people need to over exaggerate the party\u2019s stance Dali Mpofu, EFF Chairperson\n\nThe IFP\u2019s Mkhuleko Hlengwa said that the EFF was sugar-coating its stance since what it was calling for was not expropriation but amounted to the nationalisation of land instead.\n\n\n\nDespite the differences in opinion on the manner in which land redistribution should be carried out or not, all political party representatives seemed to agree on the fact that the conversation on land was one that \u201chas been long overdue\u201d and one that needed to be \u201capproached careful and with consideration for all South Africans\u201d.", "description": "It is no secret that political parties hold different views with regards to the land expropriation debate, however, during the land indaba hosted by City Press and Rapport political parties reached a consensus on one thing", "authors": ["Juniour Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8016/698dbe400b4541279f9aeeb2fce959dd.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-03"}
