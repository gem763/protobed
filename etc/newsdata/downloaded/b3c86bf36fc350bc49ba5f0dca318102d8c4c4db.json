Later in the third, designated hitter Nelson Cruz blasted another solo shot to give Minnesota an early 2-0 lead.\n\nNew York used a three-run third inning to erase the Twins\u2019 early advantage before Polanco recorded an RBI single in the top of the fifth to tie the game at three runs apiece.\n\nThe Yankees snapped the tie in the bottom of the fifth after Torres drove in Aaron Judge and Gardner with a two-run double. Twins slugger Miguel Sano answered with a solo homer in the sixth to cut the deficit to 5-4.\n\nLater in the inning, LeMahieu and Gardner each homered to extend the Yankees\u2019 lead to 7-4. LeMahieu plated three more runs with a double in the seventh to seal the victory.\n\nGame 2 of the best-of-five series is scheduled for Saturday in New York.", "description": "Oct. 5 (UPI) \u2014 DJ LeMahieu belted a home run and drove in four runs and Gleyber Torres had a two-run double to put New York ahead for good as the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
