Their goal was simple: To break the world record for the largest group of people dressed as Smurfs.\n\nThe group D\u00e4 Traditionsverein organized the event in Lauchringen, Germany on Saturday near the border with Switzerland. They had strict rules: in order to be counted, participants couldn't show any non-blue skin. They could dress as Papa Smurf \u2014 with his trademark red cap and a white beard \u2014 or Smurfette, with blonde hair and a white skirt or dress. Normal smurfs were OK, too \u2014 but some characters, like the evil wizard Gargamel, were strictly off limits.\n\nThe group posted on Facebook that 2,762 Smurfs showed up.\n\nThe Record Institute for Germany verified that number on its website. They've even provided a certificate for participants.\n\nGuinness World Records has yet to confirm the feat. The standing record is held by a group of 2,510 people in the United Kingdom in 2009. D\u00e4 Traditionsverein first attempted to break that record in 2016.\n\nThe gathering isn't the only smurf-themed record that Guinness keeps tabs on.
