Hair by Raphael Salley at Saint Luke using Oribe.\n\nHelena Bonham Carter looks the teensiest bit bored. It\u2019s a gray afternoon in England, and we\u2019re in an impeccably neat garden on the set of The Crown. The Netflix series, which illustrates the tensions between the royal family\u2019s private lives and public personae, necessarily involves many sequences full of dull protocol. Her role today: walking down a staircase. (Later she will describe it as a day in which she was essentially a \u201cpaid extra.\u201d) When she clocks me from several yards away, Bonham Carter appears momentarily roused. Across the production\u2019s busy membrane of actual extras, cameras, and cables stationed between us, she begins miming energetically, first at herself and then back at me as if to say, Are you the one who\u2019s here for me? Then places are called, and she slips into her role as Princess Margaret, the often scandalous, unhappy younger sister of Queen Elizabeth.\n\nStanding next to Bonham Carter is Olivia Colman in an ice-blue dress that fits her like a suit of armor. In character as the queen, Colman seems to disappear and is replaced by Elizabeth\u2019s implacable steadiness. Bonham Carter also uncannily replicates Margaret\u2019s speech patterns and the minimal way she moves her body through the stultifying royal traditions. She\u2019s wearing an olive-drab look so unremarkable that by all rights it should render her nearly invisible. But there\u2019s a small piece of her that remains Bonham Carter. Her inerasable verve is still glowing, unmistakable in a glancing eye or a particularly sharp tilt of the head.\n\nBonham Carter has been acting since she was a teenager, and her particular talent has been to take supporting characters and imbue them with a vitality that cannot be ignored. This is the Bonham Carter in the Harry Potter movies as Bellatrix Lestrange, unhinged and vengeful; it\u2019s also Marla from Fight Club, recalcitrant and sly, or any of her roles in a long line of period pieces that includes The Wings of the Dove in 1997 and The King\u2019s Speech in 2010, both of which earned her Oscar nominations. They\u2019re women who spill over their boundaries, who walk into a room with some uncontainable, elemental thing that threatens the natural order. On The Crown, even as the show dramatizes the wall between Elizabeth\u2019s public image and her private life, it struggles to make the tension interesting. Margaret, though \u2014 she is defined by too-muchness, by the way her image collapsed onto her inner life. In the press, she was the misbehaving sister, painted as both more sympathetic and more shocking.\n\nBonham Carter as Princess Margaret.

It\u2019s something she says she cares about much less now than when she was younger. \u201cThere\u2019s a Helena Bonham Carter who has an extraordinary life in the Daily Mail,\u201d she says. In recent months, she has been the older woman with a boyfriend some 20 years her junior, one trope of status-quo-threatening womanhood. The British tabloids have begun calling her boyfriend a \u201ctoyboy,\u201d the same word used in headlines about Roddy Llewellyn, the man Margaret had an affair with in the mid-\u201970s. In her 20s and 30s, Bonham Carter was the other woman who came between Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson, two brightly leonine British actors with promising careers. Then she was the mysterious romantic and creative partner of Tim Burton, a human projection of his uncanny gothic aesthetic who lived in a house supposedly connected to his via a subterranean tunnel. The tunnel has long been pointed to as proof of her strangeness, an arcane buried secret brought out into the open. \u201cIt was just, like, two houses put together,\u201d she says.\n\nBonham Carter insists she is not actually that dramatic or weird, but, by her own admission, she may not be the best judge. \u201cI have never really been able to see myself with any real clarity,\u201d she says, sighing.\n\nPhoto: Louie Banks\n\nI meet Bonham Carter the next day at Netflix\u2019s London offices, a narrow five-story building in Fitzrovia. The top floor, which we have all to ourselves, has a large, open workspace and three rooms: the Queen Elizabeth, the Prince Philip, and the Princess Margaret. The Margaret room, Bonham Carter notes, is much smaller than the Elizabeth.\n\nShe slumps down on a Netflix-red sofa, dressed in head-to-toe black: a combination of satin, lace, and faux fur, with a pearl collar accenting a fuzzy black shrug, black boots decorated with silver stars, and her characteristic bird\u2019s nest of tangled, teased hair piled on her head. She looks like a very posh, goth fairy godmother surrounded by the remains of snack wrappers and two empty coffee cups. The double beverages, she explains, are a strategy she uses to concentrate \u2014 in an interview, between takes. \u201cSometimes they bring a caddie on set with all this different stimulation,\u201d she says. \u201cCoffee, tea, Diet Coke, ginger water.\u201d Life during filming involves a lot of waiting around, and \u201cby the time you\u2019re on, you\u2019re bored.\u201d She consumes an \u201camazing amount of liquid\u201d to keep from falling asleep.\n\nWhen she describes her decision to be on The Crown, it too sounds a little like a way to combat monotony. This is how she describes the business of acting. \u201cYou\u2019re sitting there as a passive lump in your sitting room, and somebody comes [and says], \u2018Oh, do you fancy pretending to be \u2026 ?\u2019 \u201d Still, The Crown\u2019s creator, Peter Morgan, had to persuade her to take on the role of the younger royal sibling (never mind that it\u2019s a slightly odd fit given that Bonham Carter is several years older than Colman) for the series\u2019 third and fourth seasons, taking over from Vanessa Kirby, who portrayed the sister through her early 30s (just as Colman picked up the royal baton from Claire Foy). Bonham Carter took her time to decide. At 53, her priorities have changed: She has two children with Burton, 11 and 16 years old, and she\u2019s aware she has only so many years of childhood left with them. \u201cI don\u2019t want to play lead, in all honesty,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, I\u2019d like to play a lead as long as it doesn\u2019t take too long.\u201d\n\nBecoming Margaret entailed stepping into the life of a complicated woman. Bonham Carter plays the princess in her middle-aged years, when she began drinking heavily, during an emotionally abusive marriage. She turned to extramarital affairs \u2014 partly as a diversion, partly out of revenge for her husband\u2019s infidelity. When Bonham Carter insisted on seeing a script, Morgan told her that Colman hadn\u2019t needed to see one before signing on. \u201cWell, fuck. Already the sibling rivalry. Like, how am I going to survive this?,\u201d she recalls thinking. \u201cOlivia, I\u2019m sure, has her own criteria for doing a job, but I said, \u2018I need to read a script to know if I can do it or if I can bring something.\u2019 \u201d Morgan sent her the season-three finale, an episode dedicated almost entirely to Margaret\u2019s marital spiral.\n\nOnce Bonham Carter read it, she knew she\u2019d say yes. \u201cWhen you read something and you know you have to do it, so there\u2019s no choice,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s a great relief.\u201d (She also consulted with a psychic, who told her the spirit of Princess Margaret preferred Bonham Carter over another, unnamed actress being considered for the part.)\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of my youth that was misspent because I never said, \u2018Can you let the corset out?\u2019\n\nTo prepare, she read Ma\u2019am Darling: Ninety-nine Glimpses of Princess Margaret, a book about Margaret\u2019s press coverage, which was useful (\u201calthough I hated it\u201d). And she did what she does with almost all of her roles: talked about it with her mother, who is a psychotherapist. \u201cIt\u2019s not dissimilar, what we do,\u201d she explains. \u201cShe deconstructs people, analyzes them. And I do too. I just end up pretending to be them.\u201d She also spent some time with The Crown\u2019s art department, selecting and working with several of the objects Margaret handles onscreen. \u201cI live with my props,\u201d she says, \u201cparticularly with Margaret \u2026 Her smoking stuff has to be just part of her.\u201d She has perfect muscle memory of \u201cthe weight of a really proper gold Dior lighter.\u201d\n\nOn set, Bonham Carter listens to Mamma Mia! in the hair-and-makeup trailer to pump herself up. \u201cI inflict everybody,\u201d she says. \u201cOlivia groans at the ongoing tyranny because she\u2019s got much hipper taste. She keeps on thinking that I like spa music.\u201d But she finds it very difficult to be still, she says, and music, like her many beverages, helps keep her stimulated.\n\nThese days, she feels much more confident expressing needs like this. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of my youth that was misspent because I never said, \u2018Can you let the corset out?\u2019 I was too polite and shy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd frightened of being a pain.\u201d Working on The Crown, she has adopted some of Margaret\u2019s unwillingness to oblige. \u201cA lot of the time, Morgan will send rewrites,\u201d she tells me. \u201cMargaret\u2019s convenient because I can just say no. I can pull rank. It\u2019s the license to be powerful. \u2018Don\u2019t want any new lines now, mate. You should have given me them last week! Can\u2019t do.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPhoto: Louie Banks\n\nBonham Carter seems most comfortable describing herself in the context of other people. She talks about playing characters as having a \u201clodger\u201d living inside her who \u201crearranges the furniture.\u201d Elizabeth Taylor, whom she portrayed in Burton & Taylor in 2013, \u201cstuck around.\u201d (She demonstrates this by imitating one of Taylor\u2019s octave-spanning sighs.) Recently, she has fixated on her grandmother Violet, the daughter of H. H. Asquith, who was prime minister from 1908 to 1916. Violet was a diarist, a public speaker, an intellectual. Bonham Carter wants me to know how remarkable she was, how unusual and \u201crhetorical,\u201d intelligent and liberal. \u201cI can recognize that I can be quite passionate about certain things and words, and I thought, Oh, Violet,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s only when you get really old that you begin to see yourself more objectively and go, Oh, okay, that\u2019s where that comes from.\u201d\n\nPart of why Violet appeals to her is the way she resisted being placed in an easily labeled box. At one point, she asks me what adjective I\u2019m going to pick to describe her. \u201cEccentric, quirky \u2026 ,\u201d she offers, picking words that have been used to characterize her over the years. Does she object to quirky because it seems juvenile? \u201cTim [Burton] hated quirky,\u201d she tells me. \u201cHe found it very lazy.\u201d She was drawn to the way Morgan described Margaret as a character for whom \u201cyou can play the same scene ten different ways and it\u2019d still be right because she\u2019s so changeable. She\u2019s so inconsistent and all-encompassing.\u201d Margaret was defined by her duality. \u201cShe was spontaneous, but she was also incredibly conservative \u2026 She was very reserved, but, at the same time, she was very generous. But she does often oscillate between the two,\u201d Bonham Carter says. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know whether she was an individual or she was an icon,\u201d and it makes her \u201cmaddening and great to play.\u201d\n\nSo many peak geniuses are fucking damaged, damaging people.\n\nBonham Carter\u2019s understanding of Margaret is not unrelated to her own familiarity with the disconnect between a private self and a tabloid creation. \u201cMargaret had a terrible relationship with the press and always felt terribly misunderstood,\u201d she says. At the same time, \u201cshe never had a say. Margaret never actually expressed herself.\u201d She draws a comparison to the latest real-life royal drama: Prince Harry\u2019s decision to sue the Mail on Sunday for printing Meghan Markle\u2019s private correspondence. \u201cPart of their public persona is being themselves,\u201d Bonham Carter says, \u201cand you can\u2019t expect them to really survive through the same degree of detachment. Meghan and Harry are never going to be the people who are just the figureheads.\u201d Their openness, she says, means \u201cthey\u2019re going to have a much less easy relationship with the press.\u201d\n\nBonham Carter likes talking about the lives of other people and sifting through their desires and motivations; she is fascinated by ambiguity and contradiction. Over the course of our conversation, she grows most animated when I ask about the many men she has worked with who have, as she puts it, gotten into \u201ctrouble.\u201d \u201cWhich ones are you thinking of?\u201d she asks. \u201cHarvey?\u201d Harvey Weinstein produced The Wings of the Dove and The King\u2019s Speech, but there were also Roman Polanski (she was in a short film he directed in 2012) and Woody Allen, not to mention her several projects with Johnny Depp, who has also had quite a bit of \u2014 \u201cYep,\u201d she interrupts, \u201ctrouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cEach case is different,\u201d she continues, but \u201cthey\u2019re all freaks.\u201d She sees most cases of sexual harassment and predation as bullying, as someone \u201ctaking advantage of their power.\u201d But \u201cyou can\u2019t condemn someone totally and say they have no worth whatsoever because they\u2019ve been bullies. I think that would write off most of our culture,\u201d she says. \u201cSo many peak geniuses are fucking damaged, damaging people.\u201d Her clearest, strongest sense of the issue, the idea she returns to several times, is her confidence that people are never just one thing. \u201cHarvey, for all that\u2019s said, he\u2019s very clever. He did a lot of great things for the industry as well as being appalling to people.\u201d Still, she says, he got his \u201cjust deserts.\u201d Although she\u2019s willing to believe women were uncomfortable when working with Polanski, she makes it clear he was \u201ca real gentleman\u201d to her. (Even as she admits, after I raise the topic, that she didn\u2019t know much about his 1978 sexual-abuse conviction, nor the sexual-assault accusations he\u2019s faced more recently.) \u201cEveryone\u2019s nuanced,\u201d she says. \u201cNothing is all black.\u201d Just because good and bad often come together does not mean you can discard everything, throw it all out, and demand a history of art not made by jerks. \u201cThat work of art might have come out from a lot of pain that they\u2019d endured as a child because they themselves have been abused,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s all jumbled up,\u201d she concludes.\n\nAs we talk about it, she sits up on the sofa and leans forward. Her voice, which earlier was a whisper, suddenly becomes animated. The jumble is something she seems to enjoy. The mix of good and bad and messy contradiction, like the ways in which pretending to be people can surprise you. \u201cActing,\u201d she says, \u201cis an exercise in how to stay awake.\u201d\n\n*This article appears in the October 28, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
