Future presidents, as well as anyone in positions of power in the government, will conclude that they can abuse their position for personal gain, without fear of accountability or consequences.\n\n\u201cIf we allow the President to abuse his or her power, then our society will rot from top to bottom. We will turn into a banana republic, where people in positions of power\u2014from the president all the way down to the traffic cop\u2014will feel it\u2019s okay to abuse their power with no consequences.\n\n\u201cThis is not the kind of country that any of us want to see.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tulsi Gabbard", "Gabbard.House.Gov News Press-Releases Rep-Tulsi-Gabbard-Statement-Impeachment-Inquiry"], "top_image": ""}
