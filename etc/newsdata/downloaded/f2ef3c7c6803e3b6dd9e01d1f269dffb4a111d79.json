Don't worry about him. He's going to be okay.\"\n\nSarah Wollaston, an MP with the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrat party, is among those who have accused Mr Johnson of \"behaving like a tin pot dictator\" rather than a lovable buffoon.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nThe journalist and MP came to power selling himself as the optimistic leader to end the Brexit crisis.\n\nBut within six weeks he has seen his Conservative party's thin parliamentary majority disappear as MPs seized control of the parliamentary discussions on leaving the European Union.\n\nFailure in the coming weeks could see him consigned to history as Britain's shortest-serving prime minister.\n\n'LIKE NORTH KOREA'\n\nMr Johnson sacked 21 Tory MPs from the party for voting against the government in a parliamentary vote on Brexit on Tuesday.\n\nThat showed a ruthless streak at odds with his easy-going image and triggered a backlash from some Tories and accusations of dictatorial behaviour.\n\n\"It's like something out of North Korea,\" one aide was quoted as saying by the Politico website.\n\nMr Johnson's earlier decision to suspend parliament for five weeks, seen as a bid to frustrate its attempt to delay Brexit, drove thousands of protesters onto the streets.\n\nRACIST QUIPS\n\nThe former London mayor has in the past diverted criticism with quips which have veered into gaffes, drawing complaints of racism.\n\nHe was forced to apologise to the people of Papua New Guinea in 2006 after writing about \"Papua New Guinea-style orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing\".\n\nFour years earlier in a newspaper column he described African children as \"picaninnies\".\n\nPeople in the northern English city of Liverpool have not forgotten how he claimed that drunken fans were partly responsible for the 1989 Hillsborough stadium tragedy in which 96 football fans were killed. He accused Liverpudlians of wallowing in their \"victim status\".\n\nPOLARISING FIGURE\n\nMr Johnson became a household name partly through appearances on the satirical television show \"Have I Got News For You\".\n\nSupporters see his star power as a political asset.\n\nThey hope his maverick approach will break the political deadlock over Britain's exit from the European Union.\n\nBut he has long been a polarising figure, disliked by pro-EU voters as the figurehead of a referendum campaign marked by what they say were exaggerated claims about the EU.\n\nHe has also been criticised for his performance as foreign secretary.\n\n\"Where gravitas and grasp of detail were needed, Mr Johnson supplied bon mots,\" the Chatham House think-tank said.\n\nDespite his own apparently socially liberal views - he has long backed gay marriage and advocated an amnesty for illegal migrants as London mayor - Mr Johnson has also drawn accusations of \"dog-whistle\" politics.\n\nHis biographer Andrew Gimson said Mr Johnson was not instinctively divisive but delighted in shocking the political establishment - not unlike US President Donald Trump.\n\nCOMPLICATED LOVE LIFE\n\nBorn in New York in 1964, Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson has always been ambitious.\n\nIn 2008, harnessing his celebrity status to reach across the political divide, he was elected as mayor of multi-ethnic, Labour-voting London.\n\nHis first tilt at the Tory leadership in 2016 failed after his closest ally betrayed him, but he laid the groundwork for this year's contest early.\n\nMr Johnson resigned as Mrs May's foreign minister a year ago in protest at her EU strategy, cementing his position as the champion of Brexit.\n\nHis campaign was only briefly derailed by headlines about a police visit to his home following a noisy row with his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds.\n\nIt reignited interest in the love life of a serial philanderer who has married twice and has an unknown number of children.\n\nEducated at the elite Eton school and Oxford University, Mr Johnson started his professional life as a journalist for The Times but was sacked for fabricating quotes.\n\nHe became an MP in 2001, but was sacked as Conservative party arts spokesman in 2004 for allegedly lying about an extra-marital affair.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [LONDON] Boris Johnson has forged an image of himself as a jovial, wisecracking mophead but after a few weeks as Britain's Brexit Prime Minister the winning smile gave way this week to a scowl and a wagging finger as his ruthless streak emerged. .
