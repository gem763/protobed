Myers noted legislation introduced by the Tories in 2018 allowed them to lawfully cancel the program without consultations.\n\n\"The regulation whose legality we are asked to consider has been repealed and is no longer in existence,\" he said.\n\nFord 'dragging' Ontario away from climate action\n\nOntario's former cap-and-trade system, which linked markets with Quebec and California, aimed to lower emissions by capping the amount of pollution companies in certain industries were allowed to emit.\n\nA cap-and-trade system sets a limit on greenhouse gas emissions, but allows companies below the cap to \"trade\" their unused allowance to larger polluters.\n\n\"We are pleased that the divisional court dismissed Greenpeace's application for judicial review. Our government campaigned on a clear commitment to eliminate the cap-and-trade program that made life costly for Ontario's families and businesses,\" said Environment Minister Jeff Yurek in a statement.\n\nJeff Yurek, Ontario's Minister of Environment, Conservation and Parks, said eliminating the program removed a 'burden' from businesses. (Chris Young/Canadian Press)\n\nThe PCs say eliminating the program has saved the average Ontario family around $260 per year.\n\nBut according to Greenpeace, the cap-and-trade program was making strides toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions and growing the province's green economy.\n\n\"Although we did not receive the precise outcome we were hoping for, the majority of the court agreed that what Premier Ford's government did was illegal,\" said Ian Miron, a lawyer for the environmental group Ecojustice, which represented Greenpeace at court.\n\n\"The decision today does not alter the fact Ontarians want to see action to combat climate change, and Premier Ford is dragging the province in the opposite direction,\" Miron continued.\n\nThe government claimed the program was costly, ineffective and killed jobs, and it replaced the program with its own environmental plan that does not include a price on carbon emissions.\n\nThe cancellation of cap-and-trade prompted the federal government to implement its own carbon tax in Ontario \u2014 a move Ford's government now wants to challenge at the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nOn Thursday, the watchdog group Environmental Defence released a new report that looked at whether or not the government was adhering to its own plan to fight climate change and found \"next to no progress\" had been made.", "description": "In a split decision, an Ontario court says Doug Ford's government broke the law when it scrapped the cap-and-trade system, but\u00a0the court won't force Queen's Park to reinstate the program that gives companies incentives to reduce carbon emissions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5300202.1570797342!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/climate-strike-toronto.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
