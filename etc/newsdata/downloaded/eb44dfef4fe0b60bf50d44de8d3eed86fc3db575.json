But rather than wait for this delayed response to years of people being ripped off, customers should take steps to make sure they aren't stung now. We lay out what's happened and what you can do.\n\nThe FCA has found that loyal home and car insurance customers are paying over the odds for their policies\n\nWhat did the FCA say about insurance?\n\nInsurers have been stinging loyal car and home insurance customers on renewal quotes for years. Those who shop around get the best deal, while those who trust their insurer and simply renew are rewarded by seeing prices ratcheted up year-in, year-out.\n\nThe compounding effect on this can be huge and it disproportionately affects the less financially savvy, those less likely to compare prices online and those with less money.\n\n'This market is not working well for all consumers,' said Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA.\n\n'While a large number of people shop around, many loyal customers are not getting a good deal. We believe this affects around six million consumers.'\n\nThe FCA found that one in three consumers who paid high premiums were vulnerable in some way, such as having lower financial means.\n\nFor example, consumers who bought combined contents and building insurance and were on an income below \u00a330,000, they paid higher margins than those with higher incomes.\n\nMeanwhile, people who pay high premiums are less likely to understand insurance or the impact that renewing has on their premium, according to the report.\n\nWhat is the FCA going to do about this?\n\nThe FCA put forward a package of potential remedies, which include banning or restricting practices such as raising prices for consumers who renew year on year, or requiring firms to automatically move consumers to cheaper equivalent deals.\n\nIt also suggested restricting the way that firms use automatic renewal, which could discourage switching and force insurance providers to publish information about price differentials between their customers.\n\nA final report is set to be published in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nWhy has it taken so long to act?\n\nThe FCA has frequently come under criticism for being slow off the mark on issues that have been flagged long ago as bad for consumers.\n\nIn this instance, such criticism seems fair enough. This is Money, our sister newspaper titles Money Mail and Financial Mail on Sunday and all of our rival media publications have been banging the drum on insurers and other firms ripping off loyal customers for years.\n\nThe issue of the wider 'loyalty penalty' was raised by Citizens Advice a year ago, when the charity filed a 'super complaint', which prompted the FCA to launch an investigation.\n\nLast December, This is Money launched our Check Your Bill campaign, encouraging people to make sure that they did not fall foul of the loyalty penalty and also to step in and help family and friends who they knew would be less likely to switch.\n\nOne in three consumers who paid high premiums were vulnerable in some way, such as having lower financial means\n\nWill this fix the loyalty penalty problem?\n\nCitizens Advice's research showed that loyal customers were being penalised for hundreds of millions of pounds a year on their home insurance.\n\n'It's great to see the FCA acknowledging that the insurance market isn't working for consumers and pledging to crack down on the loyalty penalty,' said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice.\n\nBut he added: 'At the moment these are just proposals. The FCA must now follow through on these bold ideas to stop loyal insurance customers being penalised.'\n\nOne of the issues for loyal customers is that price comparison sites have made the market for those who switch so competitive that insurers have increasingly opted to protect profits by stinging those who don't.\n\nLee Griffin, one of the founders of comparison site GoCompare, said that even if most of these proposals were implemented, the 'loyalty penalty won't be wiped out', with 'millions of existing insurance customers still likely to end up paying more than new customers'.\n\n'Insurance is a very competitive market and those that shop around will always get a much better deal on their car or home insurance,' he added.\n\nThe Association of British Insurers' director general Huw Evans said they welcomed the report and would continue to work 'constructively' with the FCA.\n\n'Millions of insurance customers get extremely good deals by shopping around regularly, but we agree that the household and motor insurance markets could work better for consumers who do not shop around at renewal.'", "description": "Rather than wait for the financial watchdog's delayed response to years of people being ripped off on insurance, customers should take steps to make sure they aren't stung now.
