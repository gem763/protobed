The mother had not been constantly supervising the child. The cause of death was drowning.'\n\nThe inquest into Alia's death had been adjourned at North Staffordshire Coroner's Court in April 2017, pending a decision from the Crown Prosecution Service as to whether criminal charges would be brought in the case.\n\nIn 2018, Tawfeeq was charged with manslaughter by gross negligence in relation to her daughter's death.\n\nShe was due to go on trial in September this year, but pleaded guilty to a charge of cruelty to a child on September 17, which was accepted by the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nThe offence includes instances of neglect and failure to protect a child as well as cases involving assault and ill-treatment.\n\nThe 36-year-old, who at the time of Alia's death lived in Burslem, near Stoke-on-Trent received a nine-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months.\n\nMs Murphy said: 'Given the criminal proceedings where the facts surrounding the death have been heard in public I do not find sufficient reason to resume the inquest. That concludes matters regarding the very sad death of Alia Tawfeeq.'", "description": "Alia Tawfeeq was pronounced dead at the Royal Stoke University Hospital in January 2017 and a post-mortem examination found it was most likely she had drowned.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett", "Crime Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/10/20028982-0-image-a-38_1571737559604.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
