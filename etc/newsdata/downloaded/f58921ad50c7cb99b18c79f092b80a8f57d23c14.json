It compiled data from part-time and full-time seasonal workers who held jobs in retail, customer service, sales, labor and transportation at companies who do the most holiday hiring.\n\nDespite having a reputation for nightmarish Black Friday crowds, Best Buy takes the No. 1 spot as the best place to take on a seasonal retail gig. Glassdoor notes that high marks for culture and values, senior leadership and career opportunities have a major impact on employee satisfaction, sometimes even more so than compensation and benefits. According to the career site, 78% of Best Buy employees would recommend their company to a friend, and 77% approve of the CEO.\n\nFedEx, which ensures millions of presents are delivered by Christmas morning, comes in second, and apparel company American Eagle Outfitters ranks third. While retail job openings tick up throughout the summer, holiday hiring accelerates in September and tends to peak by mid-October, according to Glassdoor. Major players including Target, UPS, Amazon and Kohl's made headlines for announcing ambitious holiday hiring plans last month, and many more will follow in the coming weeks.\n\nRead on for the best companies to work for during the holidays.", "description": "Retailers are gearing up for a busy holiday shopping season, and hiring is expected to peak by mid-October.", "authors": ["Jennifer Liu"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106158603-1569953753081gettyimages-625640948.jpg?v=1569953847", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
