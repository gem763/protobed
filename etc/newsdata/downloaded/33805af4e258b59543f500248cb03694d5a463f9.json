The Albatross had been blown out of its next due to extreme winds, which have been getting progressively worse in the Antarctic.\n\nThe first episode of the new BBC show aired on Sunday and many viewers praised both the footage and Sir David's involvement.\n\nAhead of the BBC documentary, producers had said there was 'new footage' which would be aired.\n\nSir David (above) narrates both programmes and is pictured above during the promotional shoot for the Seven Worlds, One Planet documentary\n\nSpeaking to the Sun a spokesperson for the BBC said there had been a shoot share, which is why both crews got the same footage.\n\nThey said this wasn't 'uncommon' and added that there were only a few shared shots between both programmes.\n\n'The BBC sequence reveals a different phenomenon of the natural world that has not been shown on TV before.\n\n'It shows the presence of polar bears spooking the walrus and causing them to fall over the edge of the cliffs.\n\n'It is not uncommon to share filming shoots in natural history and there are only five shared shots out of a total of 60, which can hardly be described as the same footage.'\n\nHowever, it's not the first time the BBC has faced criticism for its production of wildlife documentaries.\n\nEarlier this year it had been criticised for naming some of the animals in its Serengeti programme the same, in order to avoid confusion.\n\nCGI is not used during the show but some previously filmed material is used.
