Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nGearing up for what promises to be a manic week of self-victimizing and lashing out at political opponents, the president previewed his state of mind on Twitter with a whirlwind Sunday even by his new standards. (Since the beginning of his presidency, Trump\u2019s tweeting has increased by 43 percent.) On Sunday, Trump sent off 46 messages on the platform, including retweets.\n\nPerhaps the most notable moment came when Trump tweeted a quote from Fox News contributor and megachurch Pastor Robert Jeffress:\n\n....If the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\u201d Pastor Robert Jeffress, @FoxNews \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\nIn a more peaceful moment, the president offered what suffices for a truce with the whistle-blower who reported on his alarming behavior with the Ukrainian president that led to an impeachment inquiry \u2014 despite appearing to threaten the intelligence officer with punishment fit for \u201ctreason\u201d on Thursday:\n\nLike every American, I deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called \u201cWhistleblower,\u201d represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way. Then Schiff made up what I actually said by lying to Congress...... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 29, 2019\n\nIn a less peaceful moment, he demanded that House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff be investigated for treason:\n\nHis lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber. He wrote down and read terrible things, then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States. I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 29, 2019\n\nCertainly the most petty moments involved an altercation on Fox News between hosts Ed Henry and Mark Levin. He retweeted a Harley guy with the handle \u201cJoe\u201d who said that Henry got his \u201cass handed to him\u201d by Levin. He retweeted another person who said: \u201cMark Levin sure put that lying shit head Ed Henry in his place didn\u2019t he?\u201d It appears Trump had a search going for the morning segment, as he commented on the on-screen tiff between Levin and Henry some 22 times.\n\nBriefly, Trump brought up Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cdeleted and acid washed\u201d emails; his allies\u2019 flawed defenses on the Sunday shows; and the wrath of Evangelical Christians who have never been \u201cmore angry over any issue than this attempt to illegitimately remove this President from office.\u201d He also wished his Jewish followers a happy Rosh Hashanah.", "description": "On Sunday, dealing with an impeachment inquiry, Trump sent off 46 tweets and retweets on Twitter, including a quote from Fox News contributor and pastor Robert Jeffress who said that there would be a \u201cCivil War like fracture\u201d if Trump is impeached.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/26/trump_tweets.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
