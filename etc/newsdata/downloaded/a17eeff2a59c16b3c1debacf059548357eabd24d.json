Army has more than 20 players from Texas and the military-friendly city has hosted the Black Knights twice before. San Antonio is home to one of the largest concentrations of military bases in the U.S., as well as the defense department\u2019s largest medical center.\n\nThis will be the first time Army is a favorite to win there and the Black Knights should have plenty of road support in the stands.\n\nArmy had its chance for the academy\u2019s first win over a top-10 team since 1963 as the Black Knights\u2019 ball-control, option offense kept Michigan off-balance all day. It was nearly identical to their near-upset of Oklahoma last season, but both efforts ended with losses in overtime.\n\n\u201cOur kids were very hurt. It still stings. It\u2019s hard to swallow being that close to beating another top-10 team and falling short,\u201d Army coach Jeff Monken said. \u201cBut, gosh, I can\u2019t say enough about the belief that our guys had that they were going to win \u2026 Now we move on.\u201d\n\nThe Roadrunners must regroup from a much different kind of loss: a 63-14 road whipping at Baylor . UTSA gave up 368 yards rushing and must quickly recover in that department before facing Army\u2019s methodical run game.\n\nAs an independent, Army will be bouncing around the country, from coast to coast and even deep into the Pacific at Hawaii, as they seek a fourth consecutive bowl bid. The Black Knights are the last non-conference opponent for UTSA before the start of the Conference-USA schedule.\n\nArmy had a similar schedule in 2018, when it won 11 games, the most in academy history.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to move on and win every game the rest of the year,\u201d Army senior linebacker Cole Christiansen said.\n\nA few things to watch for when Army meets UTSA:\n\nBIG LOAD\n\nThe Roadrunners count on quarterback Frank Harris to do it all in the offense, but he had a rough game against Baylor with just three yards rushing and 93 passing in the blowout loss. He\u2019ll need to get one of those elements rolling to keep the Black Knights\u2019 offense off the field.\n\n\u201cI shared with him that you don\u2019t need to carry the burden,\u201d UTSA coach Frank Wilson said \u201cThat falls on my shoulders.\u201d\n\nBREAKOUT FRESHMAN\n\nUTSA would like to lean on freshman tailback Sincere McCormick to share the load with Harris. The first Roadrunners\u2019 true freshman to start a season opener since the program\u2019s inaugural season in 2011, he had 87 yards on 12 carries against Baylor. Most of that came on a 54-yard touchdown run.\n\nNO TURNOVERS PLEASE\n\nLast year, Army ranked second nationally with only eight turnovers, losing just five fumbles in more than 900 snaps. That\u2019s a big key for a team whose offense relies on keeping the ball away from its opponents - Army led the nation in time of possession at more than 38 minutes per game in 2018. Through two games this season, the Black Knights have four turnovers - three lost fumbles and one interception and possession time is down more than five minutes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not our game,\u201d said senior running back Kell Walker, who had one of Army\u2019s two lost fumbles against Michigan. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take care of the ball.\u201d\n\nTACKLING DRILLS\n\nBlack Knights senior defensive back Elijah Riley was a force against Michigan with 13 tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble in the double-overtime loss. He\u2019ll be the guy the Roadrunner offense has to account for on every snap. Christiansen had 12 tackles and a forced fumble as Army held Michigan to 340 total yards.\n\nUTSA, meanwhile, missed more than 30 tackles against Baylor. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat anybody missing 30-plus tackles,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nJUST FOR KICKS\n\nThe field goal units for both of these teams are mostly untested. Army kicker Cole Talley\u2019s only attempt this season was a missed 50-yarder on a potential game-winner against Michigan at the end of regulation. The Roadrunners haven\u2019t even attempted a field goal through two games, but kicker Hunter Duplessis is perfect on seven extra points.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Army came agonizingly close to beating Michigan.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jim Vertuno"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/utsa_army_preview_football_80385_c0-133-3166-1978_s1770x1032.jpg?65586cb237132ed601f8715eae38f0556a97aaac", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
