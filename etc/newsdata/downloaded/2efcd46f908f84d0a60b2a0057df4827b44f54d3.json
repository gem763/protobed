Find somewhere dark and allow your eyes to adjust before looking up into the sky \u2013 wherever you\u2019d like, and with no special equipment needed at all.\n\nIn keeping with their name, the meteor shower will be most visible from famous constellation of Orion. But in practise, you can look just about wherever you want \u2013 and some experts recommend looking up with friends, so that you can survey the entire sky at once.\n\nMs Ross said: \u201cFor the best chances to spot the Orionids, find a dark area of clear sky and allow around 20 minutes to let your eyes adapt to the dark. It may also be advisable to lie down as you will be looking up for a long time.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association", "description": "The night sky will be lit up by spectacular celestial fireworks as Earth passes through an area of space \u201clittered\u201d with the debris of Halley\u2019s Comet.
