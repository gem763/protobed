REUTERS/Rafael Marchante\n\nOpinion polls indicate the Socialists will come top with between 36.5% and 38.8% of the vote but will need one or more parties to back them to stay in government. Costa\u2019s minority government has been backed by two far-left parties since 2015.\n\n\u201cThe main question is whether we\u2019ll have our hands tied,\u201d Costa said during a campaign rally on Friday. \u201cWe need to have the strength to guarantee four years of stability and not be a short-term government.\u201d\n\nCosta\u2019s government has been praised by Brussels and at home for combining fiscal discipline with measures to promote growth after recession and the austerity of Portugal\u2019s 2010-14 debt crisis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m voting for Costa again. He\u2019s done well for us. He represented the people, defended the people, and I can only hope he does more of the same if he wins,\u201d 81-year old Fatima Abreu said at a central Lisbon polling station early on Sunday.\n\nLuis Alberto Lopes Brazao, a 46-year old homeless man, agreed. \u201cI\u2019m from a poor family and I\u2019m struggling ... But I trust this government,\u201d he said after voting for the Socialists.\n\nBut after a series of scandals, from a nepotism row to the alleged involvement of a former minister in an army cover-up of the theft of weapons from a military base, other voters said it was time for a change.\n\n\u201cThe last four years weren\u2019t great for me. It is the same as it was in 2009 during the crisis,\u201d said 66-year old garbage collector Adriano Macedo, who voted for the center-right Social Democrats (PSD), the main opposition party.\n\n\u201cPoliticians say that everything is fine but if it is fine it is only for them ... I haven\u2019t received a pay rise since 2009.\u201d\n\nNEGOTIATIONS\n\nThe PSD is polling at under 30% and is expected to lose seats, while the Socialists are seen winning more than in 2015.\n\nPost-election negotiations are not expected to be as messy as in neighboring Spain, which still has no government more than five months after elections and is heading for a repeat poll in November.\n\nIn 2015 it took less than two months for Costa, whose party had actually come second, behind the PSD, to strike an unexpected alliance with two far-left, Eurosceptic parties, the Left Bloc and the Communists and be sworn in as prime minister.\n\nFour years on, the hard left is demanding more public spending and has accused Costa of veering to the right. Costa has already ruled out a formal coalition but may try to renew his governing pact with one of the parties or both.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nSince the last election, the People-Animals-Nature party (PAN) has grown in popularity and could become a kingmaker in parliament. PAN has said it is ready to support Costa if he commits to its environmentalist proposals, but it remains to be seen whether the party will win enough new seats.\n\nVoting began at 8 a.m. (0700 GMT) and closes at 7 p.m. (1800 GMT). Exit polls are expected an hour later and official results will trickle in through the evening. Depending on how close the outcome is, a clear picture could emerge quickly or take days or even weeks.\n\nPortugal is expected to record its lowest budget deficit in 45 years of democratic history this year. The economy is on course to grow 1.9% in 2019, above the EU average, helped by export growth and a booming tourism industry.", "description": "Portugal began voting on Sunday in an election that Prime Minister Antonio Costa's Socialists are expected to win without an outright majority, leaving the fate of potential allies as the main question.", "authors": ["Catarina Demony", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437640508&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF9504L", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
