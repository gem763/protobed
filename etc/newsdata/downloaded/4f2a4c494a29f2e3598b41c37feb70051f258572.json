Another smacked Harris with a wooden board while he lay crumpled on the ground.\n\n\u201cI kept falling,\u201d said Harris, now 22. \u201cI didn\u2019t even realize I was being hit at the time. I was just trying to get up and run, but then I fell, then I got up again, then I fell. When your adrenaline is running so high, you don\u2019t feel none of it until after the fact.\u201d\n\nThe violence on Aug. 12, 2017 \u2014 which left one counterprotester dead and dozens injured \u2014 transformed Harris into a symbol of racial strife as the video of the beating went viral. The aftermath left Harris traumatized, forcing him to give up a job he loved and making him a target of unnerving threats for the past two years.\n\nExcept for brief interviews right after the attack, he has maintained a virtual silence about what he has endured.\n\nLast month, a Charlottesville judge gave the fourth of Harris\u2019s six assailants a sentence that amounts to more than two years. The others received sentences of between nearly four and eight years. Police are still searching for the last two men, whose identities remain a mystery.\n\nWho are the last two attackers of a black man in a parking garage?\n\nBut Harris and his attackers are not done fighting in court. Two of the men are appealing their convictions. And on Aug. 12 \u2014 exactly two years after the rally \u2014 Harris sued his assailants, as well as the rally\u2019s organizers and several neo-Nazi and white-supremacist groups, alleging they violated his civil rights. He\u2019s seeking an unspecified amount of monetary damages.\n\nAs he sat on a red couch inside his Virginia apartment on a Sunday afternoon, Harris railed against their punishments, which he considers too lenient. He believes he could have easily been the rally\u2019s second death, alongside Heather Heyer, the 32-year-old paralegal who was killed when neo-Nazi James A. Fields Jr. rammed his Dodge Challenger into a crowd of people.\n\n\u201cIn the next six years, all these guys will be right back at it. I thought they\u2019d be going to jail for a longer time,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIf it had been a white guy who was attacked, and it was all my friends beating him up, we would never have seen the light of day again.\u201d\n\n'Let me see your face'\n\nBefore the rally, Harris was thriving.\n\nAfter graduating in 2015 from Lakeland High School in Suffolk, Va., he sold Nikes and Timberlands at a DTLR store. Then a cousin in Charlottesville urged him to move to the liberal college town.\n\nHe got a job serving lunch at a middle school and playing sports with kids in the aftercare program before he was offered a chance to work as a special-education aide at Venable Elementary School. He was assigned to help a pre-kindergartener with a spinal defect; she was paralyzed from the waist down and used a wheelchair.\n\nOver the next year, Harris made sure she could complete her arts and crafts. He played basketball and dodgeball with her. He was beside her as she learned to master a machine that helped her walk. When she finally nailed it, he shouted her name and took pictures.\n\n\u201cHe had tears in his eyes,\u201d said Erin Kershner, Venable\u2019s principal.\n\n\u201cShe was like my daughter,\u201d Harris said, his eyes welling up.\n\nBy the spring of 2017, Harris \u2014 known to all the kids as \u201cMr. Dre\u201d \u2014 got promoted to work as a special-education assistant at Charlottesville High School for the next academic year.\n\n\u201cI had my own apartment. I had my own job,\u201d he said. \u201cI was establishing myself.\u201d\n\nThat summer, Harris kept seeing stories online about an upcoming rally called \u201cUnite the Right.\u201d The demonstration was being organized by Jason Kessler, a University of Virginia graduate, to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a Charlottesville city park.\n\nHarris said he wondered what the white supremacists would do. What would they say to someone like him?\n\nInside Jason Kessler\u2019s hate-fueled rise\n\nGrowing up in Suffolk, where his mother had worked in the city\u2019s famous Planters Peanuts factory, Harris lived in a predominantly black neighborhood and said he never experienced blatant racism.\n\nWhen he arrived in downtown Charlottesville on that August day, what Harris saw startled him: White supremacists and neo-Nazis were wielding shields and carrying guns. Some wore face masks. Counterprotesters were chucking sticks, cans and water bottles. When someone gave him the Maglite flashlight for protection, he took it.\n\nSeveral minutes before noon, police declared an unlawful assembly and ordered everyone to leave the area. As Harris and other counterprotesters walked up Market Street, he saw a friend being struck in the chest with the tip of a heavy wooden flagpole.\n\nHe swung the Maglite, intending, he testified later, to hit the flagpole. But he wound up striking the head of Harold Crews, a North Carolina lawyer and state chairman of a white-nationalist group called the League of the South. Seconds later, Harris was pepper-sprayed \u2014 and quickly sensed he had become a target. So he fled into the parking garage adjacent to the Charlottesville police department, pursued by the pack of white supremacists.\n\nAll it took was about 10 seconds. After the beating, Harris needed eight staples to close a gash on his scalp. His left wrist was broken, a front tooth was chipped, and he was covered with cuts and bruises.\n\nThe next day, he FaceTimed with his parents, who had no clue he\u2019d even attended the rally.\n\nOn the phone, all they could see was his apartment\u2019s ceiling. \u201cI said, \u2018Hold up, DeAndre,\u201d his mother, Felicia Harris, recalled saying. \u201c\u2018Let me see your face.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen Harris finally obeyed her, all she could do was scream and cry.\n\nThe next day, his shaken parents came and moved him out of Charlottesville. They no longer felt he was safe there.\n\nHarris later resigned from his job at the school. Children and their parents showered him with farewell cards.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry this happened. I need you,\u201d wrote one kid. One set of parents wrote, \u201cDear DeAndre, We were horrified to see images of your assault. You were so brave to be there, to stand up to hate . . . Please know that we are holding you in our hearts.\u201d\n\n'Look at the video!'\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Harris to watch the video racing across the Internet.\n\nThe horrifying images of a black man being beaten by white men were reminiscent of those taken decades ago during the civil rights movement. He played it over and over, scrutinizing who did what to him.\n\n\u201cIt was just shocking to know this video was seen by so many people and that something like this would happen in 2017, and that it would happen to me,\u201d he said. \u201cThankfully, I am still alive.\u201d\n\nHarris testified against two of his attackers and faced a misdemeanor charge himself for hitting Crews.\n\nHe was acquitted. A judge ruled he didn\u2019t intend to hit anyone with the flashlight.\n\nBut the trials tested his patience. He was especially outraged that defense attorneys kept showing footage of him inadvertently smacking Crews with a flashlight moments before the attack. How did that give his own assailants a right to ask for leniency from a jury or judge?\n\nOne of his attackers, Jacob Scott Goodwin, who was carrying a full-body shield and wearing a military helmet, claimed self-defense. Goodwin\u2019s attorney, Elmer Woodard, tried suggesting to jurors that Harris had fled into the garage to continue fighting.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018How?! Look at the video!\u2019 \u201d Harris said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any weapons in my hands and I am on my hands and knees with mace in my eyes.\u201d\n\nHe also dismissed the men\u2019s apologies, especially the one from Goodwin, who told the court that \u201cif me and Mr. Harris would have met on different terms, we\u2019d be friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, no, no, we would not be friends,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Harris says he forgives the men.\n\n\u201cGod is a forgiving person, and who am I not to forgive someone?\u201d he said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I forget what happened.\u201d\n\n'He cried all day'\n\nHarris said he still suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nHe tried unsuccessfully to find another job as special-education aide in his new location, which The Washington Post agreed not to disclose. Now Harris works for a car dealership as a salesman. But Unite the Right still has a way of finding him.\n\nLast year, on his way into work, he got a Facebook message from a man named \u201cJames Stuart,\u201d whose profile page featured a photo of a Lee statue along with quote attributed to the Confederate general: \u201cStudy hard, be always a gentleman, live cleanly and remember God.\u201d The profile picture of \u201cStuart\u201d \u2014 a reference to Confederate general J.E.B. Stuart \u2014 showed a bearded man holding a sign that said, \u201cIT\u2019S OKAY TO BE WHITE.\u201d\n\nHis message to Harris: \u201cI\u2019m looking for a 2010 dark gray Dodge Challenger. Any suggestions?\u201d\n\n\u201cI put two and two together and realized that was the car that killed Heather Heyer,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI sent it straight to my attorney.\u201d\n\nWhen he arrived at work that day, his manager told Harris to go home because someone had called the corporate office asking for him. The man had made racial slurs and asked what time Harris got off work.\n\n\u201cIt freaked me out,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe got police involved. But they said there was nothing they could do about it. I was like, \u2018Where is this guy? Who is this guy?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThis year, on the rally\u2019s second anniversary, he was at work on a lunch break when memories of the beating suddenly gut-punched him. He told his manager he didn\u2019t feel right, that he had to leave, and went to his mom\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t stop crying,\u201d Felicia Harris recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018I don\u2019t know why I am feeling this way.\u2019 He cried all day long. I hugged him. I told him I loved him. But he\u2019s never seen a therapist. He doesn\u2019t want to do it. He keeps saying he\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nThe specter of the parking garage never really recedes.\n\nA few weeks ago, he was out at bar with a colleague, who introduced him to one of his own friends. The man greeted Harris and immediately said, \u201cYou look familiar.\u201d Harris shrugged and suggested maybe they had crossed paths somewhere. Or maybe he\u2019d seen some of Harris\u2019s hip-hop videos?\n\n\u201cThen the guy said, \u2018No, I know you from somewhere else,\u2019 \u201d Harris recalled. \u201cThen he was like, \u2018Charlottesville! You that dude from Charlottesville! You that dude from CNN!\u2019 \u201d\n\nYes, Harris sighed, that was him.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe story behind the searing photo of Charlottesville\u2019s worst day\n\nA black principal, four white teens and the \u2018senior prank\u2019 that became a hate crime\n\nHe always hated women.
