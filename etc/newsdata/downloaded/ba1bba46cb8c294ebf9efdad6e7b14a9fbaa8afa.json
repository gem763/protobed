But it hasn\u2019t gone away; it\u2019s been moved.\"\n\nDon't sleep: IIF president and CEO Tim Adams likened it to the market for mortgage-backed securities before the housing bubble burst in 2007, triggering the global financial crisis.", "description": "Fed's commitment to pump $60B a month into financial markets may not be enough", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/zXGiCfqdYQI5kQd41Rj5i0sHGhU=/0x41:3000x1729/1920x1080/2019/10/21/1571659516972.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
