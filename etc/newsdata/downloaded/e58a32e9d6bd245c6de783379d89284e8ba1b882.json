U.S. officials warn that if China sees Trump as desperate for a deal because of impeachment that would be a \u201cmiscalculation,\u201d according to Bloomberg.\n\nTrump officials, including White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, have repeatedly said that they would not accept anything short of an all-encompassing deal. That sets the stage for a conflict when the two sides meet in Washington, D.C. this week.", "description": "Far from getting closer, the U.S. and China are moving apart in the run-up to high-level trade talks. | Asia", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/GettyImages-1152690139-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
