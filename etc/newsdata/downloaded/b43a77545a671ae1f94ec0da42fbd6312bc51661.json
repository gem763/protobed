Paul Sayer had been given the devastating news that he had prostate cancer. It was aggressive \u2013 and his surgeon said the best chance was a major operation.\n\nThey could get him into theatre within ten days. And yet, possibly more frightening than the cancer itself was the possibility that the procedure would render him incontinent and impotent \u2013 for the foreseeable future at least. The alternative, he was told, was radiotherapy. But there were similar risks and less chance of a cure.\n\n\u2018My surgeon was strongly in favour of surgery,\u2019 recalls the 64-year-old charity fundraiser from Southend-on-Sea in Essex. \u2018And the radiotherapist told me radiotherapy was better. I was worried about both options \u2013 as they\u2019re both pretty final when it comes to maintaining normal sexual function.\n\n\u2018Oddly enough, I was less scared of having the disease than I was about what would happen after treatment. I was in my 60s, active and happily married. I didn\u2019t much like the idea of having to wear pads in my underwear for the rest of my life. What man would choose that?\u2019\n\nPaul Sayer, 64, (pictured with his wife Cindy) from Southend-on-Sea in Essex, was diagnosed with cancer in his 60s. He had high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment in July 2018 and didn't suffer any complications as a result\n\nDuring tense discussions with his consultant, Paul mentioned that he had read about another option: high-intensity focused ultrasound, or HIFU. The scalpel-free treatment involves energy beams that blast tumour cells with pinpoint accuracy. Afterwards, few patients suffer the incontinence or sexual problems that often go hand-in-hand with a more major operation.\n\nPaul says: \u2018The way I understood it, HIFU attacks the tumour directly without damaging anything else. And because of this, there was less chance of damaging the nerves round the prostate that control continence and erections, which appealed to me. But my doctors shut down the conversation. They said the HIFU was not a suitable treatment for my cancer.\u2019\n\nUndeterred, Paul decided to contact and meet the HIFU surgeon he\u2019d read about. Professor Hashim Ahmed, a consultant surgeon at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, told him he was \u2018a perfect candidate\u2019 for HIFU. Armed with this information, he asked his GP to refer him for treatment.\n\n\u2018My GP hadn\u2019t heard of HIFU for prostate cancer, but agreed.\u2019\n\nThe procedure was carried out in July 2018. Paul says: \u2018I was out of hospital that night. I had a catheter for a week and after that, I just got on with my life. I didn\u2019t suffer any complications. And, although I\u2019m having regular tests to monitor things, the cancer is gone.\u2019\n\nSurgery often leaves men with long-term erectile dysfunction, and four in ten will still need an incontinence pad after a year. Whereas HIFU could save patients from such complications\n\nTHOUSANDS OF MEN ARE NOT SO LUCKY\n\nPaul, it would seem, is lucky \u2013 not because his treatment was a success, but because he was able to have it at all. HIFU was approved by health chiefs more than a decade ago, yet just five out of 135 NHS trusts are regularly offering it, and \u2018many doctors simply are not telling men it exists\u2019, claimed University Hospital Southampton urologist Tim Dudderidge.\n\nInstead, thousands of men are having surgery and radiotherapy without being told there is an alternative, he added.\n\nSome estimates suggest that up to 12,000 prostate cancer patients every year could be eligible for some form of focal therapy, a term that encompasses HIFU and cryotherapy, a less widely available treatment which involves freezing the tumour. According to recent data, just 1,900 patients have undergone these procedures in the UK over the past ten years.\n\nMr Dudderidge says: \u2018Surgery often leaves men with long-term erectile dysfunction, and four in ten will still need an incontinence pad after a year. This can be devastating, especially for younger men who may have active sex lives.\n\n\u2018Of course, if it\u2019s a choice between dying of cancer and an operation with side effects, most men would choose the op. But many could be cured by HIFU, which would spare them from these life-changing complications.\u2019\n\nA big part of the problem is that the NHS advisory body, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), does not tell doctors to routinely offer it to patients.\n\nThis, Mr Dudderidge said, needs to change. \u2018Patients have a right to know about it, so they can make an informed choice about their options. But the fact is many don\u2019t, which is scandalous.\u2019\n\nAbout 48,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year in Britain, accounting for a quarter of all male cancer cases (stock image)\n\nSURGERY SAVES LIVES... BUT THERE IS A PRICE\n\nAbout 48,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year in Britain, accounting for a quarter of all male cancer cases. A third of patients with the disease are over 75 \u2013 but the incidence has increased six-fold in men aged 50-plus in the past 20 years.\n\n\u2018These are often otherwise fit and healthy men with careers, and love lives,\u2019 says Mr Dudderidge.\n\nSlow-growing, early-stage prostate cancers often don\u2019t require surgery or radiotherapy. But some tumours are more aggressive or faster-growing, so doctors must act before the disease spreads.\n\nIn these cases, men are often offered surgery to remove the entire prostate: a prostatectomy.\n\nThe prostate gland is part of the male reproductive system, and is vital in the production of semen.\n\nIt is about the size of a walnut and sits below the bladder, around the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body. Because of its position, removal of the gland can risk damaging the nerves responsible for bladder control and erections.\n\nThe operation is remarkably effective. About one in seven prostate-cancer patients undergo surgery, and more than 80 per cent are alive ten years later.\n\nBut there is a trade-off. A recent study found that 83 per cent of men who had a prostatectomy still suffered erectile dysfunction six years after the procedure.\n\nAnd nearly one in five needed to wear absorbent pads to combat urinary incontinence.\n\nSome men are offered radiotherapy instead of surgery. This involves using powerful X-ray beams to destroy cancer cells in the prostate, sometimes after a course of hormone treatment.\n\nBut three-quarters of men are left with erectile dysfunction.\n\nWHY HIFU CAN REDUCE RISK OF SIDE EFFECTS\n\nHIFU involves no incisions or cutting. Instead, MRI scans, which allow doctors to see structures inside the body, are used to pinpoint the location of the tumour within the prostate. Then, beams of ultrasound energy are fired into it.\n\nThese heat and destroy tumour cells without damaging surrounding tissue, as radiotherapy can do.\n\nEarly studies indicate it is just as effective as surgery and radiotherapy but due to the focused nature of the procedure, side effects are dramatically reduced.\n\nThousands of men are having surgery and radiotherapy without being told there is an alternative, claimed University Hospital Southampton urologist Tim Dudderidge (stock image of man receiving radiation therapy treatments for prostate cancer)\n\nRecent research, which included men with medium- and high-risk cancer, found those who had HIFU had a two per cent risk of urinary incontinence and a 15 per cent risk of erectile dysfunction after five years. Despite this, many men are in the dark about the approach, experts claim. Prof Ahmed said he often meets patients who have not been informed about the treatment by their consultant.\n\n\u2018The vast majority we see have found out about it on their own,\u2019 he says. \u2018Patients also tell me that when they have asked their previous doctor about it, they\u2019ve been strongly discouraged \u2013 even told they\u2019d be risking their life by having HIFU. Obviously, this puts a lot of men off when in fact, they could be ideal candidates.\u2019\n\nMr Sayer, who founded charity Prost8 UK in an effort to improve access to HIFU, said: \u2018Thousands of men have gone through unnecessary treatment since I had my diagnosis and that is a crime really. Even if you are not suitable, you deserve the right to know about all the treatment options.\u2019\n\nNot all doctors are convinced, however. Although five-year survival rates are known, data on the long-term effectiveness of HIFU is still being gathered.\n\nThis, says Mr Dudderidge, is why NICE don\u2019t recommend it as a standard treatment.\n\nThe available evidence does also raise some concerns. One in five men who have HIFU will require a second session, usually because some of the cancer was missed. And seven per cent of patients still need a prostatectomy afterwards.\n\nHIFU always leaves scarring within the prostate which Anthony Koupparis, a prostate cancer specialist at the Bristol Urological Institute, says can make later surgery challenging. There are also question marks over whether there is a need to treat less serious prostate cancer cases.\n\nIn May, NICE said that men with low-risk cancer should be offered a choice between radiotherapy, surgery and active surveillance \u2013 which involves regular tests and scans to check the progress of the disease \u2013 all of which have similar survival benefits.\n\nMr Dudderidge agrees that for some men with the disease, it is best to do nothing. He only recommends HIFU to men with medium-risk prostate cancer \u2013 those who aren\u2019t suitable for active surveillance \u2013 or men who can\u2019t \u2018psychologically manage\u2019 their diagnosis.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not saying that everyone should be recommended this treatment,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018But doctors should be informing suitable patients of its availability and of its existence, because withholding that information is not fair.\u2019\n\nMr Koupparis agrees that HIFU is an appropriate, safe option for some men. But he believes that in years to come, an increasing number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer will avoid treatment altogether.\n\n\u2018Do I think HIFU will become more widespread? No \u2013 quite the opposite,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s nothing to do with HIFU. But I think we will come to appreciate the true biology of prostate cancer and realise that actually we don\u2019t need to be treating many men with early, localised cancer in the first place.\u2019\n\nCOULD HIFU BE THE RIGHT TREATMENT FOR YOU? For men with prostate cancer reading this and wondering \u2018Could HIFU be right for me?\u2019 Tim Dudderidge has some easy-to-follow advice: Speak to your urologist about whether you are a suitable candidate for HIFU. All men regarded as such should be able to get a referral on the NHS.\n\nFor men with low-risk disease there is the option of active surveillance. No radical treatment is given immediately, and instead, the tumour is monitored by doctors. This may be the best option for some.\n\nFor those told they have have intermediate-risk disease, HIFU could be an option if the most significant tumours are confined to one side of the prostate. HIFU is shown to be effective, and cause fewer complications than surgery, when treatment is confined to a small area of the prostate. Even if there are tumours in both sides of the prostate, HIFU may be suitable. Tumours on one side may not be considered a risk, and so they can be left, while the others are treated.\n\nIf your urologist is still unsure, get in touch with The Focal Therapy Clinic (thefocal therapyclinic.co.uk), which can provide further advice.\n\nIn some cases, surgery will still be a better option. For these men, the benefits \u2013 even with complications \u2013 will outweigh the risk of doing anything else.\n\nMen may never get back to \u2018completely normal\u2019, but the outcome of surgery is usually something most find they can live with.\n\nIT DIDN'T WORK FOR ME BUT BOUGHT ME TIME\n\nThe downsides to focal therapy are all too familiar to 55-year-old journalist James, who agreed to speak anonymously about his experience. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012, aged 48, following a worrying PSA test result which he\u2019d had as part of a general private health check.\n\nLondon singleton James has since undergone HIFU twice, cryotherapy and, finally, in March this year a radical prostatectomy.\n\nBecause of scar tissue left by earlier treatments, his surgeons were unable to avoid damaging his nerves while removing the prostate. The surgery has left him incontinent, and suffering from erectile dysfunction. He uses Viagra to combat this.\n\nHe admits that if he had chosen surgery to begin with, he may have suffered fewer complications \u2013 yet doesn\u2019t regret having HIFU.\n\n\u2018Because I was younger, my cancer was likely to be the more aggressive type, so active surveillance wasn\u2019t an option,\u2019 recalls James. \u2018I was initially recommended a prostatectomy, but after doing research and speaking to consultants, I opted for HIFU.\u2019\n\nLike many men in his situation, post-surgical complications after prostatectomy were the deciding factor. \u2018It wasn\u2019t just about sex. But I was young. I wasn\u2019t ready for impotence or incontinence.\u2019\n\nNot all of James\u2019s medical team were convinced.\n\n\u2018Some doctors who had reviewed my case said they thought surgery may have been a better option,\u2019 he admits.\n\nTreatment, for the main part, was straightforward and the procedure was deemed a success, initially.\n\nBut in 2016, James\u2019s PSA levels began to rise again and scans confirmed the cancer had returned.\n\nA second round of HIFU, and then later cryotherapy treatment, failed to clear the tumour cells.\n\n\u2018They said in my case, HIFU didn\u2019t work as well the second time due to the scar tissue in my prostate left by the first round of treatment. This year, the cancer was still growing and I opted for surgery.\n\n\u2018Yes, perhaps I\u2019m in a worse place now because of the treatment I\u2019d had before surgery. But I still think I made the right decisions. HIFU bought me time, and it should be offered to men who want to avoid or postpone the collateral damage that comes with a prostatectomy.\n\n\u2018I feel like I gave it my best shot. But now, I just need to live.\u2019", "description": "Paul Sayer,\u00a064,\u00a0from Southend-on-Sea in Essex, was diagnosed with cancer in his 60s.
