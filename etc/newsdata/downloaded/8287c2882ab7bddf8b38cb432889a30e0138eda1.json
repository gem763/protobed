REUTERS/Max Rossi\n\nFailure to do would bring more misery and suffering to the region, he warned, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa where nearly one in four people already go hungry.\n\nAfrica currently has the world\u2019s highest rates of fertility, with 4.6 births per woman compared to the global average of 2.9, according to a United Nations report released in June.\n\nGirls leaving school early and entering motherhood is the \u201coverwhelming reason\u201d for this, Sachs told representatives of world leaders in a World Food Day lecture at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\n\n\u201cEducate girls, fertility rates come down, women enter the labour force. That\u2019s true across every country, every religion,\u201d said Sachs, who advised governments and the United Nations on the latest global goals agreed in 2015 to tackle these issues.\n\nU.N. figures show that 130 million girls of school age globally are not in school, and the world\u2019s highest rate of teenage pregnancy \u2014 143 per 1,000 girls aged 15\u201319 years \u2014 is in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nCurrent projections show the population of Africa could more than triple to 4.3 billion by 2100 from about 1.3 billion today.\n\n\u201cIf Africa stays on this demographic trajectory, it\u2019s impossible to end hunger and it is impossible to end poverty,\u201d said Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University in New York.\n\n\u201cNot only will those numbers run far ahead of any infrastructure imaginable and any public services imaginable, but the pressures on the physical land would be impossible, especially in an era of climate change.\u201d\n\nHe urged developed nations and donors to ensure all children across the globe completed secondary school.\n\nSachs said climate change and conflicts - which experts say are the main drivers of global hunger which has been rising for three years in a row - are \u201cutterly within our control\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe need to end the use of coal, oil and gas and move to wind, hydrogen, solar, geothermal and other zero-carbon energy sources and to complete that transformation by mid-century,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Africa, for example, replacing wood stoves with renewables could be done within 10 years, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of placing the solar panels. And Africa is blessed with wonderful solar energy. It could power the whole continent,\u201d said Sachs.\n\n\u201cThere is no problem that we face for which solutions have not been identified ... but we have been under-investing in these solutions.\u201d", "description": "ROME (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Keeping girls in schools in Africa is key to lowering the fast-growing continent's high fertility rates and ultimately ending hunger and poverty, U.S. economist Jeffrey Sachs said Wednesday.", "authors": ["Thin Lei Win", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441513181&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1D8-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
