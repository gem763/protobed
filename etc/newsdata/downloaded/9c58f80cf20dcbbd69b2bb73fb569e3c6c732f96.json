This option secured the backing of the highest number of MPs during the indicative votes on Wednesday.\n\nDowning Street has made it clear that Ms May will bring her Brexit deal back to the Commons for last-ditch attempt, despite her third attempt ending in humiliation on Friday.\n\nBut with little hope of winning over core Brexiteers or the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Ms May now faces calls to either leave without a deal, call an election or unite MPs behind a much softer exit.\n\nJustice Secretary Mr Gauke said Ms May must consider a plan by veteran Tory Ken Clarke for a customs union \u2013 which came closest to securing a majority in the last ballot.\n\n\u201cI think she would need to look very closely at that,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show.\n\n\u201cIf parliament is voting overwhelmingly against leaving the European Union without a deal but is voting in favour of a softer Brexit, then I don\u2019t think it\u2019s sustainable to ignore parliament\u2019s position and therefore leave without a deal.\u201d\n\nMr Gauke said Brexit had become a \u201cnational crisis\u201d and warned Tory MPs that they may have to accept a \u201csecond or third choice\u201d as the party does not have the numbers to push its manifesto pledges through parliament.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Cabinet ministers were ordered to abstain but big-hitters such as Philip Hammond and Amber Rudd are understood to be sympathetic to it.\n\nNo 10 hopes that pressure will lead to more Brexiteers reluctantly backing Ms May\u2019s deal after it cut the majority against it from 230 and 149 in the first two votes to 58 on Friday.\n\nBut Eurosceptic Tories delivered a show of force, signing a letter organised by Commons leader Andrea Leadsom to demand the UK leaves the EU before the end of May, even if no deal is signed.\n\nA source involved told The Independent: \u201cThe letter reaffirmed our commitment to the manifesto and to the PM\u2019s own determination to seek a short extension to Article 50 that avoids the EU elections.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, efforts to secure a Final Say vote were bolstered by the suggestion another handful of Tories could back it, including former ministers Richard Harrington and Steve Brine, who both resigned last week.\n\nSources say several Labour MPs who voted against the proposal last week are also saying they are ready to back this new compromise.\n\nJoanna Cherry, the SNP MP behind a revised plan to cancel Brexit if a no-deal scenario seems inevitable, said she had been approached by \u201cmany\u201d Labour MPs who want to back it.\n\nMPs will hold a debate on revoking Article 50 on Monday, after the record-breaking petition hit 6 million signatures on Sunday.\n\nSenior Tories have warned Ms May against calling a snap election, amid fears that the bitterly divided party would be wiped out at the ballot box.\n\nDeputy chair James Cleverly said the party was engaged in \u201csensible and pragmatic\u201d planning for a snap election but added his voice to a chorus of senior figures pleading with Ms May not to trigger one.\n\nShadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry signalled Labour could also try to trigger an election by mounting a fresh vote of confidence in the government \u2013 but she could not say when the challenge would take place.\n\nA new Deltapoll survey for The Mail on Sunday shows Labour on 41 points, five points ahead of the Tories on 36. The same pollster gave the Conservatives a seven-point lead last month.", "description": "Conservative divisions over\u00a0Brexit\u00a0have deepened ahead of a string of key votes as cabinet ministers warned\u00a0Theresa May\u00a0to change course.\u00a0 The prime minister is being pressured on all sides ahead of another momentous week, with speculation mounting that she would call a snap general election if her fourth attempt to pass her Brexit deal fails.", "authors": ["Lizzy Buchan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/31/13/AFP-1F94C5-0.jpg"}
