Major stock indexes fell into negative territory after the\n\ncancellation, which came as trade talks were held in Washington\n\nand U.S. President Donald Trump said he wanted a complete trade\n\ndeal, not just an agreement for China to buy more U.S.\n\nagricultural goods. Before the news, the S&P 500\n\nand Dow industrials were in positive territory.\n\nFor months, Wall Street has bounced up and down with signs\n\nof improvement or deterioration in trade talks, often based on\n\ncomments or tweets from Trump, a cycle investors have grown\n\naccustomed to.\n\n\"In this case, it's a bit more concerning because it's China\n\nmaking the decision, rather than Trump,\" said Willie Delwiche,\n\nmarkets strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.\n\nTrade optimism in recent weeks helped elevate the S&P 500\n\nto just shy of its all-time high hit in July.\n\nEight of the 11 major S&P sectors fell on Friday. The S&P\n\n500 consumer discretionary index and tariff-sensitive\n\nS&P 500 information technology index declined the\n\nmost, down 1.2% and 1.1%, respectively. The Philadelphia chip\n\nindex slid 1.8%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.59% to end\n\nthe week at 26,934.46 points, while the S&P 500 lost\n\n0.49% to 2,991.99.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.8% to 8,117.67.\n\nFor the week, the S&P 500 fell 0.52%, the Dow lost 1.05% and\n\nthe Nasdaq declined 0.72%.\n\nNetflix tumbled 5.5% after CEO Reed Hastings made comments\n\nunderscoring growing costs and rising competition from Walt\n\nDisney Co DIS.N , Apple Inc and other video streaming\n\nservices. Adding to Netflix's woes, Evercore ISI said recent data\n\npainted an uncertain picture of the company's international\n\nsubscriber growth.\n\nThe S&P 500 healthcare index , which has been the\n\nworst performing S&P sector this year, clocked the biggest gain\n\namong the 11 major sectors, up 0.6%.\n\nMerck & Co MRK.N gained 1.4% after the company's drugs\n\nPifeltro and Delstrigo received FDA approval for use in certain\n\nadult patients with HIV-1 who are \"virally suppressed.\"\n\nRoku Inc slumped 19.2% after Pivotal Research\n\nstarted coverage of its shares with a \"sell\" rating.\n\nXilinx Inc dropped 6.8% after Chief Financial\n\nOfficer Lorenzo Flores said he would step down, prompting Bank\n\nof America Merrill to downgrade the chipmaker to \"neutral.\"\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a\n\n1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the\n\nNasdaq Composite recorded 47 new highs and 51 new lows.\n\nWith investors unwinding positions in futures and options\n\ncontracts before they expire, volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.8\n\nbillion shares, compared with a 7.1 billion-share average over\n\nthe last 20 trading days.", "description": "US STOCKS-Wall Street drops after China cancels trip to Montana farmland", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB9M0BY_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
