The siblings are posed back-to-back in one picture and are making silly faces in the next.\n\n\"Double the laughter and double the love,\" Dion captioned the photo. \"Happy 9th Birthday, Nelson and Eddy! I\u2019m so very proud of my boys. I love you!\"\n\nShe also wrote the same message in French.\n\nDion has three children, the twins and an older son, Ren\u00e9-Charles, 18, whom she shared with her late husband, Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil.

I want nothing. No party. Today is my day. I want to be in my pajamas. I want to take as long as I want to sip my coffee. I want to be with my kids,'\" she said.\n\nShe added that she wasn't celebrating turning 51, but rather that she was turning 1.\n\n\"And I decided I am not going to be 51,\" Dion said. \"I\u2019m now (starting over as) 1 year old. So I pushed that chapter of 50 pages behind me. So I\u2019m 1 year old.
