I don\u2019t think they can do any deals.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of recent mass shootings, Trump has said he willing to consider new gun legislation \u2013 including background checks and so-called Red Flag laws. He has not, however, put forward a concrete proposal yet, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he is waiting to see what Trump supports first before bringing any legislation for a vote.\n\nThis week, however, the president suggested it could be a casualty of the impeachment fight.\n\n\u201cYou know, we were working on guns \u2014 gun safety,\u201d Trump said, as he lashed out at Democrats. \u201cThey don\u2019t even talk \u2014 all they\u2019re talking about is nonsense.\u201d\n\nAs lawmakers bolted for their two-week recess, the chairmen of three House Democratic committees issued a subpoena Friday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for Ukraine-related documents, in light of the whistleblower report against Trump that ignited the new impeachment push.\n\nFor her part, Pelosi insisted this week that Democrats could go after Trump and still pass legislation.\n\n\u201cWe continue to move forward on meeting the needs of the American people and making progress for them ... At the same time, we take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe can do both.\u201d\n\nSome lawmakers, though, are skeptical of bipartisan cooperation.\n\n\u201cThis is going to suck up the oxygen from the room,\u201d Rep. Jeff Van Drew, D-N.J., told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cWhether it was President Clinton \u2014 or before President Clinton, President Nixon \u2014 when all that activity goes on, it is the focus of the media. It is the focus in the legislature. It is the focus of just about everybody in Washington.\u201d\n\nCongress, however, was able to come together on one pressing issue this week: The Senate passed a temporary government funding bill on Thursday that staves off the risk of a government shutdown through Nov. 21.\n\nThe measure would buy additional time for lawmakers to work to hammer out a $1.4 trillion bundle of yearly spending bills that is hung up amid fights over Trump's border wall and abortion. Those measures face a variety of obstacles, and it's not clear whether Congress will pass them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPelosi announced the impeachment probe Tuesday after months of personal resistance to a process she has warned would be divisive for the country and risky for her party.\n\nTrump, who thrives on combat, has all but dared Democrats to move toward impeachment, confident that the specter of an investigation led by the opposition party will bolster rather than diminish his political support.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The escalating, all-consuming fight on Capitol Hill over the House Democrat-led impeachment inquiry against President Trump\u00a0is threatening to derail legislative deals once seen as within reach\u00a0as lawmakers left Washington Friday for a two-week recess.", "authors": ["Alex Pappas", "Alex Pappas Is Senior Politics Editor At Foxnews.Com."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/pelosi-trump-thumb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
