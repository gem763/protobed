Council", "language": "en", "text": "Batchelor has brandished a reputation as a booster of the traditional public school system, advocating for the city to invest more in neighborhood schools instead of building additional charter and application campuses.\n\n\u201cThe center of true choice is providing every family with a by-right choice in their neighborhood,\u201d Batchelor said. \u201cEverything else is supplementary. Choice starts from that.\u201d\n\nBatchelor switched his party affiliation from Democrat to independent in recent weeks. By law, one of the two at-large seats up for grabs in 2020 must go to a candidate who is not affiliated with the District\u2019s majority party, which is Democrat.\n\nMore than 75 percent of D.C. voters are registered Democrats, and the second open at-large seat will probably go to a Democrat.\n\nRobert C. White Jr.\u2019s (D-At Large) seat is also up for reelection in 2020.\n\nBatchelor, 26, grew up in Congress Heights in Ward 8 and attended schools in the traditional public and charter sectors. If elected, he would be the youngest official on the 13-member D.C. Council.\n\nBatchelor \u2014 who works as a communications and program coordinator for the Young Elected Officials Network, an organization that supports elected officials \u2014 has served on the D.C. State Board of Education since 2017.\n\nThe board holds little official power in the city, but representatives are often visible education advocates. He previously served as an advisory neighborhood commissioner in Congress Heights.\n\nBatchelor said that education would be at the center of his campaign and that the city could tackle poverty by improving its schools.\n\nThe D.C. Council chairman assigns committees, and Batchelor\u2019s run does not mean that he would lead the education committee.\n\n\u201cEducation has to be at the center of the discussion, and for far too long, it\u2019s been at the margins,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that education is tied to public safety, criminal justice, it is tied to housing affordability and employment.\u201d\n\nAs cities gentrify and schools diversify, PTOs grapple to ensure all parent voices are heard\n\nD.C.\u2019s Maret School releases investigation detailing allegations of sexual abuse at the private school\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Batchelor serves as the Ward 8 representative on the D.C.
