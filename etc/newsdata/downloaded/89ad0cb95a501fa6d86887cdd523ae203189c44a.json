Yet 24 hours after the journalist Charlotte Edwardes made an explosive allegation that Boris Johnson had inappropriately grabbed her thigh, the Conservatives were still dealing with that revelation by trying not to talk about it.\n\nCabinet secretaries stuck to scripts about \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d and the opportunities for the country after leaving the EU, but at event after event politicians were asked by journalists to give their thoughts on the alleged incident, which Edwardes says took place 20 years ago at a lunch when Johnson was editor of the Spectator.\n\nA terse Nicky Morgan \u2013 the culture secretary and one of the Tories\u2019 most senior women \u2013 said at one fringe event: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s spokesman has been very clear. There is no truth in these allegations. I have no further comment to add.\u201d\n\nJust an hour earlier she had been asked the same thing. The journalist\u2019s question was met with groans from activists, clearly irritated the story had run into a second day.\n\nThe housing minister, Esther McVey, questioned whether the alleged incident happened. \u201cWhat I hear is he\u2019s categorically denied that and usually Boris doesn\u2019t really say too much about anything, so I think you need to go back and check whether it did happen,\u201d she said.\n\nBoris Johnson groping a woman\u2019s thigh? I can believe that | Suzanne Moore Read more\n\nOne minister said in a private meeting that Johnson\u2019s alleged \u201cpinching of a knee\u201d \u2013 Edwardes claimed it was her inner thigh \u2013 was \u201cpriced in\u201d by voters and they did not think it would damage him in the long term. However, on the conference hall floor, activists were concerned about how the negative press about the prime minister and his relationship with women would play out.\n\nAnnabel Tall, the Conservatives\u2019 prospective parliamentary candidate for Bath, said: \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been charged, he hasn\u2019t been found guilty. Someone could brush against my shoulder now. My interpretation can then lead to people making huge value judgments. People are making a huge value judgment now about unsubstantiated allegations. If this has happened to this woman it needs to be taken very seriously.\u201d\n\nTall added: \u201cThe timing of this makes me uncomfortable. Why not mention anything for 20 years and bring it up now? The timing of it makes it look like it\u2019s politically motivated.\u201d\n\nAbout the possible long-term effect of the alleged incident, Michaelene Holder-March, the founder of the BME small business group for the Conservatives, said: \u201cWhen you look at the Conservative party there\u2019s no doubt about it, we have a lot of females in leadership, including Theresa May, and coming out with this at this time \u2013 it\u2019s to undermine the whole ethos and where we are going. It seems people are searching for a reason to undermine the party at the moment.\u201d\n\nTall said she was worried it might have a longer-term impact among female voters. \u201cIt\u2019s so divisive. People start to make value judgments. It probably will have a damaging impact.\u201d\n\nHowever, Toby Young, an associate editor of the Spectator, laughed off the allegation. He told an event at conference: \u201cBack then at the Spectator, in those raucous days, people complained if Boris didn\u2019t put his hand on their knee. Times really have changed.\u201d\n\nFatigue among activists with questions about Johnson\u2019s personal conduct set in by mid-afternoon. When the Mirror\u2019s political editor, Pippa Crerar, asked if Johnson was responsible for the coarsening of political debate using words such as \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d, and for mentioning the murdered MP Jo Cox in the context of Brexit, she was booed by the crowd.\n\nJohnson has strenuously denied the incident happened and continued to tour receptions at conference as planned. At the private Women 2 Win event, to encourage women to stand as Conservatives, he was met politely at the door by the co-founder Anne Jenkin.\n\nHe got laughs and cheers from the crowd when he said: \u201cAt an election, whenever that happens, I want to see more women elected to parliament. When I ran City Hall it was virtually a feminocracy.\u201d\n\nPointing to his former deputy Victoria Borwick, he said: \u201cVictoria, my wonderful deputy mayor, can testify to that.\u201d\n\nHowever, not all activists were agitating to move the debate on or dismiss Edwardes\u2019 allegations out of hand. One Tory member said they thought the revelation could be the tip of the an iceberg.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere will be more to come. I\u2019m surprised this didn\u2019t come out during the election period.\u201d", "description": "Conservative activists raise concerns despite ministers\u2019 efforts to avoid issue", "authors": ["Kate Proctor", "Frances Perraudin", "John Crace", "Katy Balls"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42ef2d0b45817c5843e69331bf14740e6eaff7f3/0_132_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d7bb77766e83421e1ca0d107a3394554", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
