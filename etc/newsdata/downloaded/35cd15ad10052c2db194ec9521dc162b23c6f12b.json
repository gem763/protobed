Which does what? Forced abortions, killing of people of wrong religions, shutting down of churches...They don't have a problem doing business with China, but Iowa? Boy, they must be bad people.\"\n\nJIM BRESLO: TO HELP HOMELESS, CA TURNS TO DUMB IDEA LOVED BY THE LEFT -- AND GUARANTEED TO FAIL\n\nSan Francisco Mayor London Breed announced the measure last week.\n\nIn a statement, Breed said: \u201cEvery day in this country, women\u2019s reproductive rights are threatened, and we have to fight back. Just as we restricted spending with states that have laws that discriminate against LGBTQ people, we are standing up against states that put women\u2019s health at risk and that are actively working to limit reproductive freedoms.\"\n\nShe added: \u201cBy limiting travel and contracting with certain states, we are sending a clear message to states that disregard the right to abortion.\u201d\n\nDel Beccaro told Doocy that it seems like \"California has a cultural war with the rest of the country,\" citing Hollywood's threat to boycott Georgia after Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams lost the governor's race and the state's threat to stop football teams from traveling after some states refused to fund gender transitions.\n\nHe predicted that legal issues will quickly arise if city businesses have existing contracts with companies in one of the 22 states on the list.\n\n\"And, of course, the other aspect of this is...California has this homelessness problem,\" he added. \"San Francisco in particular. So, are we buying all of San Francisco or just their social justice laws?\"\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, California was home to almost a quarter of the United States' homeless population in January of 2018.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CHECK OUT THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We have enough fighting in this country...To me, it's \u2013 again \u2013 the arrogance. What matters more, by the way?\" he asked. \"Homelessness in your streets or what your feeling about Indiana is? I suggest California pay attention to itself.\"", "description": "San Francisco\u00a0is showing arrogance with its decision to\u00a0blacklist doing business\u00a0with companies from 22 states\u00a0that have\u00a0\u201crestrictive\u00a0abortion\u00a0laws,\" the former Chairman of the California Republican Party said Wednesday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/ff-san-fran-FOX.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
