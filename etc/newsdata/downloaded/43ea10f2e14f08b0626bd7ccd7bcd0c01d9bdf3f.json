If we win the game, if we lose the game, if we tie the game, we want to be paid equally, period.\u201d\n\nThe USWNT filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation earlier this year and entered into mediation just before the World Cup started in France in June. The women\u2019s team has fought long and hard to get paid the same as their male counterparts, who win fewer games but get paid roughly $30,000 more per player.\n\n\"If and when and ever they are willing to have a conversation about equal pay that starts there then goes forward, we\u2019re always open for that,\" @mpinoe tells @arobach. https://t.co/7RW7r32q9c pic.twitter.com/oGAEqu4oLn \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) August 15, 2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite simple from our perspective,\u201d teammate Christen Press said on \u201cGMA.\u201d \u201cWe want to be paid equally, and that just means that when we show up to a game, that we get compensated the same way a man would for showing up for the same game. Because, on this issue, there is no social equality for women without financial equality.\u201d\n\nThe team is currently on a World Cup tour after going undefeated in the 2019 World Cup this summer. The USWNT defeated the Netherlands 2-0 in the World Cup final.\n\nIn the past three years, women\u2019s soccer games have generated more total revenue than the U.S. men\u2019s games and have attracted more viewers. The team has won three of the last four Olympic gold medals in soccer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually about women everywhere being treated equally and respectfully in the workplace,\u201d Press told \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cAnd so if that means that we\u2019re gonna go to trial, then we\u2019re going to do that, and we\u2019re going to do it very confidently.\u201d", "description": "\"It\u2019s quite simple from our perspective,\" her teammate Christen Press said during a Thursday interview on \"Good Morning America.\"", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d5572122400009a01b8651e.jpeg?cache=laxoju30cp&ops=1778_1000"}
