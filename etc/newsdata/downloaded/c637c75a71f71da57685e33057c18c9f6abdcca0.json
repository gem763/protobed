This year, an estimated 40,000 will die from breast cancer. Early detection is critical for long term survival: when tumors are removed before metastasis, the 5-year relative survival rate is 99%. The rate lowers to 84% when metastasis spreads to the breast; and plummets to 23% once metastasis enters the blood stream.\n\nPioneered at Mass General Hospital in Boston, 3D mammography or tomosynthesis was FDA approved in February 2011. Unlike 2D mammography which takes one image of the breast, 3D mammography takes about 60 images. Images are transferred to 1mm digital slices, and radiologists can see the compilation from a three dimensional point of view.\n\n2D mammograms are still essential in saving lives. However, 3D mammography has numerous benefits. It can detect tumor tissue that couldn't otherwise be seen, especially in fibrous breasts. It has reduced the number of false positives, helping radiologists to see a cyst or calcification that might otherwise be confused for a tumor under 2D mammography. It also gives doctors a better look at the topography of tumors: how they grow and spread.\n\n\"Early diagnosis is clearly critical to survival,\" Jeffrey Epstein affirms, whose foundation supports cutting edge science research around the world. \"We are very excited that 3D mammography is playing a role in stopping breast cancer from developing.\"\n\nThe Dubin Breast Center is part of The Tisch Cancer Institute, located on the Mount Sinai School of Medicine campus and houses a range of highly advanced services, from prevention to survivorship.\n\nContact: The Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation\n\nwww.jeffreyepstein.org\n\nSOURCE www.jeffreyepstein.org", "description": "NEW YORK, July 25, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- The Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City is one of the few places in the world that provides 3D...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://prnewswire.com/content/dam/prnewswire/common/prn_facebook_sharing_logo.jpg", "published_at": "2012-07-25"}
