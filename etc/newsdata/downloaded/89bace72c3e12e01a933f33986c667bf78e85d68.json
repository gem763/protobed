This image, published in The View yearbook, was obtained by Time.\n\nTORONTO (Reuters) - The man who gave Time magazine the photo of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wearing brownface at a school event said on Friday he had no political affiliation nor did he receive any payment for releasing the image.\n\nVancouver businessman Michael Adamson said in a statement he was motivated solely by the belief that \u201cCanadian public had a right\u201d to see the photo.\n\nThe photo was taken at a gala dinner of British Columbia private school West Point Grey Academy (WPGA) in 2001, when Trudeau was a 29-year-old teacher at the school, showing him in a Middle East-inspired costume, skin darkened by makeup.\n\nTrudeau repeatedly apologized for the embarrassing photo, which came to light less than five weeks before the federal elections, in which he was already facing a tough fight.\n\nAdamson was part of the WPGA community at that time and provided a copy of the photo, which he had in a school yearbook, to Time, the magazine said when it published the story last week.\n\n\u201cI am not and have never been a member of a political party. I received no payment for releasing this photograph,\u201d Adamson said.\n\nTrudeau also explicitly acknowledged his mistakes, going so far as to call Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic Party and the first person of color to lead a federal political party, to apologize directly.", "description": "The man who gave Time magazine the photo of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wearing brownface at a school event said on Friday he had no political affiliation nor did he receive any payment for releasing the image.", "authors": ["Moira Warburton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434643951&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q1O5-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
