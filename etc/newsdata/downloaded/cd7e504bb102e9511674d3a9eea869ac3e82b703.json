But instead of talking money, migration, and trade between two independent nations, Ramos writes about pride, status, and respect, saying:\n\nWe are talking about sovereignty, about dignity and basic respect for human rights, under circumstances where the safety of people fleeing gangs, violence and extreme poverty is at stake. Mexico should never forget that for decades it was an \u201cimmigrant exporter.\u201d Now it must treat Central Americans with the same care and respect it has always demanded for Mexicans living in the United States. It\u2019s true: President Trump is using Mexico. And, against all logic, Mexico is letting him get away with it. This has to change.\n\nMexican officials are protesting in public, but the evidence suggests that Donald Trump is getting Mexico to expand the 'Remain in Mexico' & other security programs to block migration & labor-trafficking into US job market. Good news for working Americans. https://t.co/48EhSGzX9P \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 11, 2019\n\nRamos came to the United States on a temporary student visa in 1983 and parlayed that into a news anchor job at a Spanish-language TV station in Los Angeles. He won a green card but only decided to become a citizen 25 years later, in 2008.\n\nBut Mexico has changed since Ramos left. A July 2019 poll, for example, shows that Mexicans\u2019 view towards migration has turned hostile amid the conflict and turmoil of the cartel-managed migration:\n\nMore than 6 in 10 Mexicans say migrants are a burden on their country because they take jobs and benefits that should belong to Mexicans. A 55 percent majority supports deporting migrants who travel through Mexico to reach the United States.\n\nThose findings defy the perception that Mexico \u2014 a country that has sent millions of its own migrants to the United States, sending billions of dollars in remittances \u2014 is sympathetic to the surge of Central Americans. Instead, the data suggests Mexicans have turned against the migrants transiting through their own country, expressing antipathy that would be familiar to many supporters of President Trump north of the border.\n\nYet Ramos says the relationship between his homeland Mexico and the United States is unequal, so Mexico must again help migrants reach the United States, regardless of the impact on his fellow nationals in the United States:\n\nA salient feature of Mexico\u2019s current foreign policy is precisely AMLO\u2019s reluctance to confront anyone outside of the country. In short, American officials say what they want, and Mexico \u2014 almost always \u2014 goes along with it. The relationship between the two nations is by no means an egalitarian one. \u2026 What can Mexico do? It must refuse to be Mr. Trump\u2019s wall, to be the United States\u2019 waiting room and safety valve. Mexico must re-embrace its honorable tradition of protecting the persecuted and most vulnerable, whether they\u2019re fleeing civil war in Spain or crime and hunger in Central America.\n\nNYTimes tells tales of alligator-filled moats to shift the readers' attention from the reality that Donald Trump successfully fought his advisors, business lobbies, and family to partway fulfill his campaign promise to shrink illegal migration. Civics 101 https://t.co/DuDmnUfBy3 \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 2, 2019\n\nImmigration Numbers:\n\nEach year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics.\n\nBut the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of about 1.5 million white-collar visa workers \u2014 including approximately one million H-1B workers and spouses \u2014 and about 500,000 blue-collar visa workers. The government also prints more than one million work permits for new foreigners and rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants.\n\nThis policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth and stock values for investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions.\n\nThe federal policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign, white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor shifts wealth from young employees toward older investors. It also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, reduces marriage rates, and hurts children\u2019s schools and college educations.\n\nThe cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with drug addiction.\n\nThe labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the Heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, undermines suburbia, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.\n\nBut President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American\u201d policy is boosting wages by capping immigration within a growing economy. The Census Bureau said September 10 that men who work full-time and year-round got an average earnings increase of 3.4 percent in 2018, pushing their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, to bring their median wages to $45,097 for full time, year-round work.", "description": "The Mexican government must help poor migrants travel to the U.S. border, says Mexican immigrant and Univision anchor Jorge Ramos.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/journalist-Jorge-Ramos-speaks-trump-19-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
