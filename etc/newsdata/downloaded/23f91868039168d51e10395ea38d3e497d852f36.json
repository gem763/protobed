It could also squeeze vulnerable Republicans by forcing them to go on the record. Many Republicans, so far, have attempted to stay away from the burgeoning scandal consuming the White House.\n\nBut the move isn\u2019t without risk, particularly for vulnerable Democrats in pro-Trump districts. And it could open Democrats up to another front of GOP criticism, as Republicans demand more power in the investigation, including the ability to issue subpoenas and call their own witnesses.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and other top House Republicans have complained repeatedly that Pelosi has violated past precedent by refusing so far to hold a full House vote authorizing the inquiry.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, you have given no clear indication as to how your impeachment inquiry will proceed \u2014 including whether key historical precedents or basic standards of due process will be observed,\u201d McCarthy said in a letter to Pelosi earlier this month. \u201cIn addition, the swiftness and recklessness with which you have proceeded has already resulted in committee chairs attempting to limit minority participation in scheduled interviews, calling into question the integrity of such an inquiry.\u201d\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/0d/b3/08dda1db44dc8b035fc7a44ad869/impeachment-evolution2.png\"\n\nAnd White House Counsel Pat Cipollone vowed the administration wouldn\u2019t cooperate in Democrats\u2019 probe, saying the process was \u201cillegitimate\u201d and \u201cconstitutionally invalid\u201d in the absence of an inquiry vote.\n\n\u201cIn the history of our nation, the House of Representatives has never attempted to launch an impeachment inquiry against the president without a majority of the House taking political accountability for that decision by voting to authorize such a dramatic constitutional step,\u201d Cipollone wrote to Pelosi.\n\nSome Democrats have supported calls for a vote on the floor, hoping it could bolster their case in court as well as silencing their GOP critics. But others have argued that it is not necessary, dismissing Republican complaints that they've been cut out of the process.\n\n\"I don't much care about the vote on the floor,\" said Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), noting that he would vote for the inquiry if it came to the floor. \"The point is that it's not required under the rules and there is absolutely no right being denied to the Republicans.\"\n\nThe vast majority of the Democratic caucus has publicly declared support for the caucus\u2019s impeachment push. But Pelosi and her lieutenants have so far resisted calls for an impeachment inquiry vote, which they\u2019ve pointed out is not required by the Constitution or House rules.\n\n\u201cIf we want to do it, we\u2019ll do it. If we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t. But we\u2019re certainly not going to do it because of the president,\u201d Pelosi told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's editorial board earlier this month.\n\nJust seven Democrats remain opposed to the impeachment inquiry: Reps. Jeff Van Drew (D-N.J.), Anthony Brindisi (D-N.Y.), Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.), Jared Golden (D-Maine), Kendra Horn (D-Okla.), Ron Kind (D-Wis.) and Colin Peterson (D-Minn.).\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1f/e5/da07c20d4c04a878c2dbd661e54b/20191015-nancy-pelosi-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
