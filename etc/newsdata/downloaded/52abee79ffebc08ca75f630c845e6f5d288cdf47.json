Some, including Mr. Erickson and Mr. Beck, now fiercely defend Mr. Trump, joining many former foes who are speaking out loudly against the impeachment inquiry. Others who contributed to the issue like Ed Meese, the attorney general under Ronald Reagan, has helped Mr. Trump plan his transition and build his administration.\n\nThe \u201cNever Trump\u201d taint still lingers three and a half years later. National Review\u2019s editor, Rich Lowry, said that, regrettably, that week\u2019s magazine was remembered as the \u201cNever Trump\u201d issue. \u201cI wish they\u2019d never come up with that phrase,\u201d he said. Mr. Lowry, who spent three weeks recruiting and assigning writers for the issue, still does not shy away from publishing or writing pieces that are harsh toward the president. But he acknowledges that Mr. Trump has helped conservatives like him \u201cstress test your assumptions,\u201d and has forced him to rethink issues like the need to take a tougher approach with China.\n\n\u201cHad I known this was going to be perceived as the bible of the anti-Trump movement, I never would have written it,\u201d said L. Brent Bozell III, who in his National Review essay wrote, \u201cTrump might be the greatest charlatan of them all.\u201d He now counts himself as a Trump convert.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Never-Trumper-Republicans.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
