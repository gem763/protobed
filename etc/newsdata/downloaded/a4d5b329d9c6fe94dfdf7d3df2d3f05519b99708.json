It is on the level of a disease that's wiping out all of America's forests.\"\n\nStony Coral Tissue Loss Disease attacks the tissue of coral, transforming healthy, vibrant marine ecosystems into drab, dead worlds within weeks.\n\nLucas Jackson/Reuters\n\nThe disease has ravaged the entire Atlantic reef off Florida, spread across parts of the Caribbean and has recently been reported near Belize in central America. Pillar coral, whose clusters of spiky fingers appear to reach up from the sea bed, is \"reproductively extinct\" off the Florida coast, said Keri O'Neil, chief coral scientist at the Florida Aquarium.\n\nLucas Jackson/Reuters\n\nAt the aquarium, a rare ray of hope comes from a room that has the lights off for much of the year. Here, an elaborate and expensive system of LED lights is designed to emulate sunrises, sunsets and phases of the moon to coax pillar coral in tanks into reproducing as if they were in the ocean.\n\nNeely\u2019s team have also been laboriously applying a paste combined with amoxicillin to the coral, which they say has been effective in treating the disease.\n\nLucas Jackson/Reuters\n\nStony Coral Tissue Loss Disease kills over 20 species of coral, including most of the important ones that build the reef, hold it together and protect the shoreline, said Neely.\n\nLucas Jackson/Reuters\n\nScientists are working together to try to find solutions. A Disease Advisory Committee has been set up to help coordinate and scientists are performing fieldwork to bolster each others' research. They are, they say, like first responders at the scene of a disaster.\n\nDespite that, little is known yet about what causes the disease. In Sarasota, Erinn Muller and her team at the Mote Marine Laboratory's Coral Reef Research and Restoration Center are among those trying to identify the pathogen behind it and how it spread from Florida to the Caribbean. \"\n\nLucas Jackson/Reuters\n\n\"We're getting these jumps and so that would suggest that there's some type of human influence that is allowing that jump to occur,\" said Muller.\n\nLucas Jackson/Reuters\n\nNear the start of 2019, the disease was spotted off the coast of the Virgin Islands. There, Marilyn Brandt of the University of the Virgin Islands' Center for Marine and Environmental Studies and her graduate students are ripping out the diseased coral to try to stop it from spreading.\n\nHer team -- like Neely's and others -- are joining forces and working frantically to prevent the loss of this delicate and complex underwater world, with its iridescent colors and rippling textures.\n\nLucas Jackson/Reuters\n\nSuch a loss would represent \"a loss of biodiversity which could be a source for future medicines, the loss of fisheries, the loss of tourism value,\" said Brandt. \"A lot of Caribbean islands have part of their culture based around coral reefs and if you lose those reefs you lose an aspect of their culture.\"", "description": "In just five years, a disease has wreaked devastation on the fragile coral ecosystems that are already at risk of extinction from the effects of climate change.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/coral-1-rt-er-190926_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
