On Wednesday night the leader of the group organising the weekend rally, Jimmy Sham, was hospitalised by men wielding hammers.\n\nThen on Saturday night a man handing out pro-democracy flyers was stabbed in the neck and stomach.\n\nFootage posted on social media showed the alleged assailant shouting shortly after the knife attack: \u201cHong Kong is part of China\u2026 (You) messed up Hong Kong\u201d.\n\nFigo Chan, from the Civil Human Rights Front \u2014 Sham\u2019s group \u2014 said democracy supporters needed to show they remained unbowed.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t come out tomorrow, then violence will prevail and escalate: the violence inflicted by the regime, the police and local triads,\u201d he told reporters Saturday.\n\n\u2013 Mob attacks \u2013\n\nVigilante violence has mounted on both sides of the ideological divide.\n\nIn recent weeks pro-democracy supporters have badly beaten people who vocally disagree with them \u2014 although those fights tend to be spontaneous outbursts of mob anger during protests.\n\nIn contrast, pro-democracy figures have been attacked in a noticeably more targeted way, with at least eight prominent government critics, including politicians, beaten by unknown assailants since mid-August.\n\nProtesters have labelled the attacks \u201cwhite terror\u201d and accused the city\u2019s shadowy organised crime groups of forming an alliance with Beijing supporters.\n\nBeijing has denounced the protests as a foreign-backed plot and condemned attacks on those voicing support for China.\n\nBut it has remained largely silent on the attacks carried out against pro-democracy figures.\n\nSecurity was ramped up ahead of Sunday\u2019s march with key subway stations near the gathering shuttered early and a ring of steel thrown up around a nearby terminus for high-speed trains to mainland China.\n\n\u2013 Months of unrest \u2013\n\nHong Kong has been battered by 20 weeks of pro-democracy protests which have seen millions peacefully take to the streets.\n\nBut there have also been increasingly violent clashes between riot police and smaller groups of hardcore activists.\n\nWith no political solution in sight, the clashes have intensified each month.\n\nHardliners have embraced widespread vandalism and throwing petrol bombs, while riot police have responded with increasing volleys of tear gas, rubber bullets and, more recently, live rounds.\n\nThe rallies were triggered by a now-abandoned plan to allow extraditions to the authoritarian mainland. But they morphed into wider calls for democracy and police accountability after Beijing and local leaders took a hard line.\n\nProtesters are demanding an independent inquiry into the police, an amnesty for those arrested and fully free elections, all of which have been rejected by Beijing and Hong Kong\u2019s unelected leader Carrie Lam.\n\nEarlier this month city leader Lam invoked a colonial-era emergency law to ban face masks.\n\nThe decision set off a new wave of protests and vandalism that shut down much of the city\u2019s transport network.\n\nIn the last fortnight, the clashes have become less intense with the city\u2019s subway closing each night at 10pm.\n\nBut protests have continued with many defying the mask ban during \u201cflashmob\u201d rallies.\n\nOn Friday night thousands gathered outside subway stations in an array of face masks while on Saturday night hundreds of mostly masked protesters held a prayer vigil in the commercial district.", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 Large crowds of Hong Kongers defied a police ban and began an illegal march on Sunday, their numbers swollen by anger over the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/d610c9_thousands-joined-unsanctioned-rally-in-hong-kong-regardless-democracy-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
