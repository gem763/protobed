Michael Steele is former chairman of the Republican National Committee.\n\nIn the wake of the 2016 election, when Democrats lost the presidential election but won the popular vote for the second time in 20 years, it\u2019s easy to understand why momentum to abolish the Electoral College once again gathered on the left. It\u2019s not so easy to understand, though, why Republicans have become so committed against the idea of a national popular vote in response.\n\nThe Denver Post recently reported that Republican Sen. Cory Gardner actually donated $50,000 to an effort to withdraw Colorado via a referendum from the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. The compact is an agreement that state legislatures have voted to join that would pool the electoral votes from among the participating states. Once the 270-vote threshold has been reached between those participating states, they would award all of those votes to whoever wins the popular vote across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Fifteen reliably blue states, plus the District of Columbia, have joined the compact since 2006, but it has not been as popular among Republicans\u2014perhaps because of some kind of partisan loyalty to the Electoral College.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat loyalty is misguided, though. From a practical standpoint, moving to a national popular vote may well be the best way, and perhaps the only way, for Republicans to have a reasonable chance of winning the White House in 2020 and beyond. That\u2019s because, despite President Donald Trump\u2019s widely unexpected 2016 electoral victory, there is no red state advantage in the Electoral College. And things are going to look much, much worse for the GOP\u2019s chances with the Electoral College if red Texas, along with the battleground state of Florida, move to purple or blue in the coming years.\n\nThe electoral numbers for the 2000 through 2016 presidential elections illustrate the illusory nature of any perceived red state Electoral College advantage. Over those five elections, Republican candidates received, in total, 1,240 electoral votes\u2014an average of 248, or 22 votes shy of the 270 needed to win the White House. The Democratic candidates received, in total, 1,441 electoral votes\u2014an average of 288, or 18 votes beyond the magic number of 270.\n\nMost political analysts agree that under the present winner-take-all system of awarding electors, no Republican can win the White House without Texas and its 38 electoral votes. That is bad news for Republicans, because Texas appears to be solidly in play in 2020. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) recently told the Washington Post that the chances of Trump taking Texas are \u201cby no means a given.\u201d \u201cThe president\u2019s reelection campaign needs to take Texas seriously,\u201d he said. Observers of Texas politics agree. \u201cI think what we saw in the 2018 elections and what we continue to see in the 2020 elections, is a much more competitive state electorally,\u201d Joshua Blank, manager of polling and research for the Texas Politics Project, recently told the Houston Chronicle.\n\nUnder the current system, a narrow popular vote loss would deliver all 38 of Texas\u2019 electoral votes to the Democrat in 2020. The result would likely be game over for the GOP\u2018s chances at the White House.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Texas, either. In Florida, Sen. Rick Scott reports that more than 180,000 Puerto Ricans have arrived and registered to vote since the 2017 hurricanes. Previous surveys of Puerto Rican voters in Florida have shown that the overwhelming majority of them have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, and so it\u2019s not a stretch to say that they will probably support Democrats, at least in 2020. If Florida and its 29 electoral votes move from purple to solid blue, the Blue Wall would have 271 votes. And it would be all over for Republicans.\n\nThe good news is that under a national popular vote, a Republican could probably survive a narrow popular vote loss in Texas or Florida and still win the presidency, because every GOP vote in those states would still count toward a national popular vote majority.\n\nThe same rule applies in Colorado. Under a national popular vote, Colorado can stay blue, as it\u2019s been since 2004, and still contribute enough popular votes to help elect a Republican to the White House. But under the present winner-take-all system, GOP voters in a blue Colorado might just as well stay home for all the difference they will make in determining who becomes president.\n\nOf course, this works in reverse, too. Democrats in West Virginia might as well stay home right now, too. Their votes would count under a national popular vote as well. In West Virginia, as in Colorado, the best candidate would win. But we believe that America is a right-of-center country, and a popular vote would reflect the true preferences of the American people.\n\nJust to be clear: The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact would not abolish the Electoral College. Getting rid of the Electoral College would be a long and cumbersome process requiring a constitutional amendment. The compact would leave the Electoral College in place, recognizing that states already have the authority, under Article 2, Section 1 of the Constitution, to award their electors in any way they see fit.\n\nTrump clearly understands the conservative appeal of a national popular vote, pointing out in a January 2017 interview with ABC News that the new system would require a different, far more expansive strategy than his campaign employed in 2016. \u201cI would\u2019ve won the [2016] popular vote if I was campaigning for the popular vote,\u201d he said. \u201cI would\u2019ve gone to California, where I didn\u2019t go at all. I would\u2019ve gone to New York, where I didn\u2019t campaign at all. I would\u2019ve easily won the popular vote, much easier in my opinion, than winning the Electoral College.\u201d\n\nPlainly, Trump can go toe-to-toe with any Democrat and win the popular vote. He won the 12 battleground states where roughly 95 percent of the 2016 campaign was waged by more than 832,000 votes. In doing so, he boosted turnout in Florida, Michigan and North Carolina by a total of nearly 1.2 million votes.\n\nRepublicans can win under a national popular vote. They simply need to get behind it before time runs out.", "description": "Before it\u2019s too late.", "authors": ["Michael Kruse", "Saul Anuzis", "Michael Steele"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/22/db/e82406c048659a29ddc3bccb5e3a/190828-anuzissteele-ap.jpg"}
