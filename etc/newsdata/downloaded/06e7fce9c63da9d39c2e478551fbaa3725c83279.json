They spent a week looking for him but were unable to find him and decided he must have been stolen, or had died\n\nDay in and day out the dog could be seen waiting by the side of the road for years after he got lost in February 2015\n\nBelieving his dog had died or been stolen, Noi was happy to be greeted by a tail-wagging BonBon.\n\nNoi said, BonBon had jumped out of the car when they had stopped at a petrol station in early 2015, and despite their week-long efforts to look for him he was nowhere to be found.\n\nHowever, despite the happy reunion, it seemed BonBon was quite content in his new home and would not return with his former owner.\n\nAs a result they have decided to leave the dog in the spot he now calls home, with Ms Pinnuchawet and other locals promising to feed him everyday and Noi pledging to visit regularly.", "description": "In a touching story of the power of social media, the dog, originally named BonBon, was recently reunited with his grateful owners after four years of waiting by the roadside in southern Thailand.", "authors": ["Corazon Miller For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/15/19593504-0-image-a-52_1570804484669.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
