Matt Vacca/Brown Harris Stevens\n\nThe master suite includes a separate sitting room as well as double bathrooms. In one, the bathtub is positioned beneath a large window overlooking the park.\n\nThe seller is Lindsay Rosenwald, an investor and entrepreneur in the bio pharmaceuticals industry. Dr. Rosenwald bought the property for about $30.55 million in 2008, shortly after the building was completed, public records show. Ms. Gross, who is listing the property with colleagues Diane Abrams and David Kornmeier, said Dr. Rosenwald is selling because he lives primarily outside the city, and barely uses the unit. He has opted to rent it over the past few years, she said. Dr. Rosenwald declined to comment. Designed by architect Robert A.M. Stern, 15 Central Park West has been home to celebrities like actor Denzel Washington and musician Sting, who last year sold his unit to a Hong Kong buyer for $50 million. Last month, billionaire investor Daniel Och listed his penthouse for $57.5 million, The Wall Street Journal reported. Building owners have access to a 14,000-square-foot spa, a fitness center, a private restaurant, a screening room, a game room and a library. The apartment also comes with a private wine cellar on the lower floors of the building, a separate one-bedroom service apartment and two storage units.
