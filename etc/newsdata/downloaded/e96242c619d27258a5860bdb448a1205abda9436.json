It belongs to a 1960s collection from samples of soil and leaf litter in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, which was donated to the Natural History Museum in 1978.\n\nIt is part of the Ptiliidae family of beetles, which includes some of the world's smallest insects.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
