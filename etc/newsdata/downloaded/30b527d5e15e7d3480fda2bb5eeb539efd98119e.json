The company now has more than 158 million subscribers worldwide. The numbers suggest that Netflix is seeing a rebound in subscriber growth, even if it\u2019s not as much as Netflix may have hoped.\n\nFollowing today\u2019s earnings, Netflix\u2019s stock jumped back up, showing a sign of confidence from Wall Street. Netflix\u2019s stock had dropped around 23 percent since its second quarter earnings in July, which marked the first time the company had lower subscriber growth since launching its streaming service in 2011.\n\nThis increase in subscriber growth this quarter came from an affluence of original content, including Stranger Things\u2019 third season, which saw 64 million accounts watch the newest season in the first four weeks, according to the company. Netflix recently signed co-creators Matt and Ross Duffer to an overall deal with the streaming service, which will see them produce more TV shows and films for Netflix.\n\nThis is the final calm before the storm for Netflix\n\nThis is the final calm before the storm for Netflix. The next time Netflix reports earnings, there will be two major new entrants in the streaming market: Disney and Apple. Some analysts are concerned that Netflix could see a dip in streaming subscribers, its core business, as people test out new services, Disney+ and Apple TV Plus. Other analysts are less concerned, citing Netflix as the dominant player in streaming right now.\n\n\u201cIn this environment the stock looks vulnerable and I question its upside potential when Netflix will soon face significant, real competition from a variety of media companies all launching their own streaming services at a substantial discount to the fees Netflix is charging,\u201d Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com, told The Verge ahead of Netflix\u2019s earnings.\n\nStill, Netflix executives are aware of the wave of new competition they\u2019re facing. CEO Reed Hastings recently admitted that it\u2019ll be \u201ctough competition\u201d once all the different services are available for customers. That includes entrants from AT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia (HBO Max) and Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal (Peacock) in 2020, too. (Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge\u2019s parent company.)\n\n\u201cWhile the new competitors have some great titles (especially catalog titles), none have the variety, diversity and quality of new original programming that we are producing around the world,\u201d Hastings wrote.\n\nThis clash is colloquially being referred to as the \u201cstreaming wars,\u201d and recent months have proven the real battle is over exclusivity deals. First-look deals with Hollywood\u2019s top showrunners, including J.J. Abrams and Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, are routinely hitting nine figures. Bidding wars over long-running, adored series like Seinfeld and The Big Bang Theory are reaching north of $500 million. Netflix has to spend more in order to continue scaling and offering exclusive series.\n\n\u201cThe likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the shift from linear TV to on demand,\u201d Hastings wrote.\n\nTo ensure it can bid against Disney, Apple, WarnerMedia, and NBCUniversal, Netflix has increased its debt load in order to spend more on content. Netflix executives have long said that getting away from licensed content and spending more on in-house development should theoretically lessen that load. Netflix is still bidding on precious licensed series, spending $500 million to obtain the global streaming rights to Seinfeld and stealing it away from Disney-owned Hulu, but it hasn\u2019t been as aggressive about claiming older series. Instead, WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal have fought tooth and nail to get important series like The West Wing, Friends, and The Office on their own upcoming streaming services.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t shy away from taking bold swings if we think the business impact will also be amazing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a busy time to be a consumer of entertainment, and a turbulent period for those delivering new shows and movies directly to customers. Netflix has to expand its reach, looking at markets like India and South America as growth sectors. Hastings has suggested that India could produce more than 100 million new subscribers alone. But some analysts have found that India isn\u2019t growing as fast as Netflix would like, despite the company pouring resources into developing more original content.\n\nDespite the trepidation some people have about Netflix, especially as the streaming wars are really just beginning, the company isn\u2019t in any real threat. It\u2019s producing more originals than any of its competition, has a substantial lead in subscribers compared to its competitors, and is still a household centerpiece. While concerns about quality of programming have circulated, on top of frustrations from fans and creators over Netflix axing shows before their third season, Netflix executives seem to have a strategy in place.\n\n\u201cAmazing content can be expensive,\u201d Hastings wrote in his letter to shareholders. \u201cWe don\u2019t shy away from taking bold swings if we think the business impact will also be amazing. We don\u2019t close every deal we chase and we don\u2019t chase every deal on the table. And while not all projects that we do pursue will work out, our large and growing subscription base helps enable us to try many approaches.\u201d", "description": "Netflix bounced back from a disastrous second quarter, adding 6.8 million subscribers and bringing in $5.2 billion in revenue over the past three months, up from 6 million subscribers and $3.9 billion the same time last year.
