Add in something like a security fee, and there\u2019s just no way most people or organizations would be able to afford it,\u201d Samantha Miller, an organizer with DC Action Lab, a company that helps organize protests, told The Washington Post.\n\nThe park service did not give a reason for withdrawing the proposal, but it did explain the rationale for introducing it.\n\n\u201cThe volume and complexity of permit requests has increased dramatically over the years,\u201d NPS said in a statement. \u201cThe intent of the proposed revisions was to maintain the public\u2019s opportunity to hold special events and right to demonstrate while outlining clear parameters that protect the iconic landmarks, views and grounds for use and enjoyment of citizens and visitors from around the globe.\u201d\n\nThe National Mall has always been a popular location to stage protests, but the rate of demonstrations has increased under the Trump administration. The Women\u2019s March, March for Science and March for Our Lives have all held major events on the National Mall.", "description": "The National Park Service (NPS) is withdrawing a proposal that would have charged protesters for the security costs associated with demonstrating on the National Mall.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/sciencemarch_042217gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
