Yet, both the current and prospective miners face changing fortunes related to price fluctuations of the mining equipment and the cryptocurrencies they dig for. Luckily, the businesses such as RP9 Mining from Portugal have taken the stage with an aim to help the crypto enthusiasts and investors find the shortcut to hitting a genuine gold vein whenever they decide to invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor starters, RP9 Mining operates as a cryptocurrency mining equipment store that goes above & beyond the call of duty when it comes to serving diverse user profiles. Sure, trying one\u2019s hand at mining is impossible without having access to quality equipment, but the RP9 Mining team understands that providing a timely piece of advice tailored to various client profiles is just as important when they plan to invest in cryptocurrencies. Thus, this team will be able to provide prospective miners and investors with in-depth analyses of cryptocurrency market trends and offer advice on the state-of-the-art mining equipment, cryptocurrency trading, and other relevant fields.\n\nWhen all is said and done, cryptocurrency mining in 2019 is still profitable, provided you have access to the top-notch tools. At RP9 Mining, the status of the top-of-the-line piece of hardware is not earned by simply slapping the most expensive price tag on it. To help its clients hit that much-desired price/performance sweet spot sooner, the company will give a 15% discount to each of its first-time buyers as well as provide them with access to a broad range of mining products suitable to any budget, ambition and professional background.\n\nThese include Bitcoin, Equihash, Dash and ASIC miners, made by renowned manufacturers such as Bitmain, Innosilicon, Obelisk, Ebang and others. All of the products can be offered as part of the company\u2019s regularly available super deals, so customers are well-advised to be on the lookout for those, as well as for bulk discounts on the offer.\n\nGoing beyond the mining hardware sales and blockchain advisory services, the RP9 Mining\u2019s business has expanded to the degree that the company now aims to become a full-blown global mining equipment retailer. This is to be achieved by expanding its product portfolio with its own mining machine and a dedicated mining platform. Considering that its operations already cover the markets in Europe, the United States, Asia and Africa, RP9 Mining can be said to already possess a quality customer base which can be used as springboard to provide its products and services on a global scale.\n\nOne of its trump cards is the planned deployment of its internally developed mining machine over the course of the next two to three years. Once launched, this machine should allow RP9 Mining to go toe-to-toe with the large players in the global arena. These efforts should go hand in hand with the company\u2019s plans to develop and offer to the market an open cloud-based mining platform that should be ready by late 2020.\n\nIn the meantime, the RP9 Mining clients will be able to get their hands on the most anticipated miner of the year, the Innosilicon G32-1800.\n\nThis model made by Innosilicon features two mining algorithms (Cuckatoo31+, Cuckatoo32+) and offers a maximum hash rate of 328GPS for a power consumption of 1800W. The expected price range should be close to EUR 12,000, but the potential buyers are invited to check whatever special offer RP9 Mining may have in store for them when the final launch date gets near.\n\nIn any case, those who decide to purchase this or any other piece of equipment from RP9 Mining can rest easy enjoying the guarantees offered under the company\u2019s delivery policies. All orders are guaranteed to be delivered within 48 hours of receiving the order confirmation without delay, and international shipping is fully supported. Being in the business which values timeliness themselves, the RP9 Mining team knows that even the slightest delay might hurt one\u2019s operations in both short and long run, and they do their best to deliver the goods tailored to the clients\u2019 demands and without a single hour of delay.\n\nFor more info, visit RP9 Mining Website.", "description": "Disclaimer: The text below is a sponsored article.\r _________\r \r Cryptocurrency mining still manages to capture the imagination of users, more than a decade after Bitcoin mining became a truly global phenomenon.
