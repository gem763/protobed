Allen\u2019s sister, Jody, raised the \u201c12 Flag\u201d above the stadium prior to kickoff, wearing a Seahawks jersey.\n\nAllen purchased the Seahawks in 1997 and helped keep the team in Seattle after former owner Ken Behring attempted to move them to Southern California. He owned the franchise until his death last year from non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Jody Allen, Allen\u2019s sister, became the controlling owner and chair of the franchise following her brother\u2019s death.\n\nAllen is the 12th member of the Ring of Honor, joining Hall of Famers WR Steve Largent, DT Cortez Kennedy, OL Walter Jones, and former stars QB Jim Zorn, CB Dave Brown, RB Curt Warner, DE Jacob Green, QB Dave Krieg, coach Chuck Knox and broadcaster Pete Gross.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Seattle Seahawks inducted late owner Paul Allen into the team\u2019s Ring of Honor prior to Thursday night\u2019s game against the Los Angeles Rams.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/rams_seahawks_football_63108_c0-126-3010-1880_s1770x1032.jpg?d87c314269555c1bc58160f9b18f615d3822efdc", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
