A split-decision loss to Lyoto Machida followed, and while he righted the ship with a win over Chidi Njokuani, the Brazilian missed weight for the contest. Now he has decided to move up to 205 pounds and make inroads toward a second Bellator title.\n\nHis first test is a significant one. Russia\u2019s Nemkov (10-2 MMA, 3-0 BMMA) is riding a five-fight win streak, including back-to-back victories over former Bellator light heavyweight champions Liam McGeary and Phil Davis in his last two outings. Victory over a third former Bellator champion in Milan could put Carvalho within touching distance of a shot at the 205-pound title held by two-division champ Ryan Bader.\n\nBoth men are predominantly strikers, with their combined record boasting 20 knockouts. But which finisher will get their hand raised in Italy on fight night? MMA Junkie\u2019s resident fight analyst Dan Tom is on hand to break down the X\u2019s and O\u2019s of the contest ahead of a pivotal battle in Bellator\u2019s light heavyweight division.\n\nCheck out the fight breakdown in the video above.", "description": "MMA Junkie fight analyst Dan Tom takes a closer look at the Bellator 230 main event.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Dan Tom", "Mike Bohn", "Matt Erickson", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bd-bellator-230.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
