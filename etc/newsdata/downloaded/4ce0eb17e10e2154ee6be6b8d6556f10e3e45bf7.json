I have been perfectly clear with President Erdogan: Turkey's action is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes,\" Trump added.\n\n\"The US will aggressively use economic sanctions to target those who enable, facilitate, and finance these heinous acts in Syria,\" Trump said, going on to say he's prepared to \"swiftly destroy Turkey's economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path.\"\n\nTrump said the US will also stop negotiations with Turkey on a $100 billion trade deal, while increasing tariffs on steel back up to 50% after reducing them to 25% in May.\n\nThis move adds to the already complicated nature of the relationship between Turkey and the US, who are technically allies as members of NATO.\n\nNATO did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider.\n\nUS lawmwakers have been excoriating Trump over the Turkish operation\n\nTurkey launched a military operation in northeast Syria last Wednesday, just several days after the Trump administraiton announced it was withdrawing US troops from the area.\n\nTrump's decision to pull US troops out of that part of Syria has been broadly criticized, as Turkey's military operation primarily targets Kurdish forces who bore the brunt of the US-led campaign against ISIS.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which lost approximately 11,000 fighters as it served as the tip of the spear in the effort that crushed ISIS's so-called caliphate, described the move as a \"stab in the back\" by the US.\n\nTrump's decision prompted rare backlash from Republicans in Congress like Sen. Lindsey Graham, as many US lawmakers felt he'd abandoned US allies to a slaughter at the hands of Turkey.\n\nTurkey views the People's Protection Units (YPG), the dominant fighting force in the SDF, as a terrorist group. The US partnership with the SDF, which has included arming the YPG, has been a source of tension between Washington and Ankara.\n\nTrump's statement on sanctioning Turkey does not mention the Kurds once. But his reference to potential war crimes comes amid reports of atrocities committed by Turkish-backed fighters in Syria against Kurdish fighters.\n\nThe president has vehemently defended his decision to withdraw US troops from northeast Syria, which has already pushed the Kurds into seeking an alliance with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Russia, both US adversaries.\n\nMeanwhile, the Turkish invasion has opened the door for the resurgence of ISIS.\n\nKurdish forces have been detaining thousands of ISIS fighters, but their attention is now focused on the Turkish operation. Hundreds of ISIS-related prisoners reportedly escaped from a camp over the weekend and the US has also suspended operations against the terror group amid the Turkish incursion. ISIS has claimed responsibility for at least two attacks in Syria following the launch of the Turkish operation.\n\nThe US is withdrawing the remainder of its troops in northern Syria on top of those relocated in the northeast part of the country, but Trump in his Monday statement said that a \"small footprint of United States forces will remain at At Tanf Garrison in southern Syria to continue to disrupt remnants of ISIS.\"", "description": "This move adds to the already complicated nature of the relationship between Turkey and the US, who are technically allies as members of NATO.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da4d511cc4a0a355e4a37e7?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
