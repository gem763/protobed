The Fed later this month is expected to cut interest rates for the third time in 2019.\n\nCompared to August, the CPI, which tracks costs for household goods and services, was flat as energy prices continued their recent decline, falling another 1.4 percent, including a 2.4 percent drop in gasoline.\n\nOver the last 12 months, CPI rose 1.7 percent, the same as in August, as energy prices are down 4.5 percent.\n\nEven when volatile food and fuel prices are stripped out, core CPI rose just 0.1 percent for the month, below economists\u2019 expectations.\n\nCompared to September of last year, the core measure was up 2.4 percent, also the same as August \u2014 which had been the biggest increase since July 2018 and a level not exceeded in a decade.\n\nThat measure was held down by a steep 1.6 percent drop in used car prices, but economist Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics said they are expected to rebound, a repeat of what happened at this time last year.\n\n\u201cOverall, these data offer nothing to Fed hawks seeking to prevent another rate cut at the end of this month,\u201d he said in an analysis.\n\nIn addition to shelter and medical care, costs for auto insurance and household furnishings rose, along with education and air fares.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Tumbling energy costs kept\u00a0US consumer inflation in check last month, blunting upward pressures in prices for housing and medical", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/93aa7e_us-energy-prices-fell-in-september-are-year-holding-cpi-weak-fuel-prices-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
