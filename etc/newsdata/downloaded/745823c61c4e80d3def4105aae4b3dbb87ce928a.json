The Wall Street Journal first reported the news. CNBC later confirmed it.\n\n\"The climate for raising long-short equity hedge fund assets has been far more difficult than I expected, and performance of the VAM funds, while good ... has not provided the necessary momentum to bring in our desired level of investments.\"\n\nVinik Asset Management funds rose 4.8% on a net basis between March 1 and Sept. 30, the letter said. The funds will close by Nov. 15.\n\nThe fund manager, who made a name for himself running Fidelity's Magellan fund before going out on his own, announced his comeback in mid-January. At the time, he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that \"the fire in my belly still burns.\"\n\nBut Vinik had a hard time raising money. Vinik Asset Management had more than $500 million in assets, according to the Journal, but Vinik hoped to raise between $2 billion and $3 billion. Vinik, who owns the Tampa Bay Lightning hockey team, told the Journal he needed to raise more money for the \"economics\" of the business to \"make sense.\"\n\nThe asset-management industry has been under pressure lately as the rise in passive investment vehicles such as exchanged-traded funds has pressured fees.\n\nSubscribe to CNBC on YouTube.", "description": "Jeffrey Vinik, the billionaire investor who relaunched his hedge fund earlier this year, is cutting his comeback tour short.", "authors": ["Fred Imbert"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103551747-GettyImages-467340592.jpg?v=1571853444", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
