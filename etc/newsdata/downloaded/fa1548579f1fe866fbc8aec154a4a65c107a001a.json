The deployment comes amid the ongoing Turkish operation against the Kurdish-led militias, which control several towns in the border area.\n\nState news agency SANA broke the news on Monday, confirming the earlier sightings of the Syrian troops in the area, first spotted overnight.\n\nThe confirmation comes a few hours after Turkey signaled that its military and affiliated Syrian \u201copposition\u201d militants have sought to enter the city after the withdrawal of the Kurdish-led militias.\n\n\u201cWe are about to implement our decision on Manbij,\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters on Monday. \u201cWhen Manbij is evacuated, we will not go in there as Turkey. Our Arab brothers, who are the real owners, the tribes ... will return there. Our approach is to ensure their return and security there.\u201d\n\nThe map of control in Syria is once again going through rapid changes after Turkey began an invasion of the northeast border areas, dubbed \u2018Operation Peace Spring.' The offensive targets Kurdish-led militias that Ankara considers to be terrorists. This includes the so-called Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group, that has been the key US ally in its fight against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) terrorists.\n\nAlso on rt.com One out, another one in: Retreating US military meets advancing Syrian Army (VIDEO)\n\nTurkey\u2019s operation kicked off days after the decision by US President Donald Trump to withdraw American servicemen embedded with the Kurdish forces, in a move that has been condemned by his critics as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the Syrian Kurds. Trump said the move was needed to \u201cend the endless war.\u201d\n\nAs the Turkish-backed operation gained momentum, Trump authorized a withdrawal of US troops from the region so they wouldn't get caught in the crossfire. At the same time, the Syrian Army made a move towards the northern border \u2013 which the US troops blocked it from reaching for years \u2013 in order to support Kurdish-led forces against what it called \u201cTurkish aggression.\u201d\n\nSyrian Army meet US troops on a highway as American forces move out from Kobani.

On Monday, RT\u2019s video agency Ruptly filmed Syrian units advancing towards the Kurdish-held border town of Kobani \u2013 and meeting US troops on their way out.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
