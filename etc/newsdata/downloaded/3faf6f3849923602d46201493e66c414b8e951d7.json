The Penny Panel represents 10-year-old Penny, who in 1795 was taken from her community to Gunston Hall. (Perkins+Will)\n\nPenny was around 10 years old when she was ripped from her family in Maryland and displaced to Gunston Hall, the stately, brick mansion in the middle of a 5,550-acre slave labor camp owned and operated by George Mason IV.\n\n\u201cShe was about the same age as Mason\u2019s daughter,\u201d said Wendi Manuel-Scott, an African American studies and history professor at the university named for the man who helped draft the U.S. Constitution and co-authored the Virginia Declaration of Rights. \u201cShe would have been an aide. Bringing food to Ann [Mason], emptying her [urine] pot, helping to clean.\u201d\n\nWhile schools like Georgetown University, the University of Virginia and the College of William & Mary have been criticized for their ties to slavery, George Mason University and the man the school is named after have, for the most part, escaped the same level of scrutiny.\n\nStudents and faculty members who researched his history urged campus leaders to acknowledge Mason\u2019s past \u2014 all of it. He was among one of the state\u2019s largest slaveholders, forcing more than 100 people into slavery over the course of his lifetime, said George Oberle, a history librarian at the university.\n\nIn 2021, the university plans to confront the man and the full breadth of his life with a memorial dedicated to the enslaved people whose labor helped Mason build his fortune.\n\nKye Farrow, 22, one of the students who worked on the project, hopes the research by students and faculty members will spark conversations about freedom in the United States. Americans in recent years have clashed \u2014 sometimes, physically \u2014 over what to do with schools, statues and other structures that honor Confederate soldiers, slave owners and anti-abolitionists.\n\n\n\nThe memorial was designed by Perkins and Will, an architecture firm based in D.C., and it will span about 300 feet in a courtyard on the Fairfax City, Va., campus of George Mason University. (Perkins+Will)\n\nA statue of Confederate Army Gen. Robert E. Lee was at the center of violent protests that exploded in 2017, about a two-and-a-half-hour drive away from George Mason University, in Charlottesville.\n\n\u201cI was never one to say we need to change the name of the university because of this,\u201d Farrow said. \u201cI think it\u2019s just something we need to learn from. It\u2019s about embracing the past as opposed to distancing ourselves from it.\u201d\n\n\n\nStudents started questioning Mason\u2019s past in 2016 after reading the will he wrote for his children in 1773.\n\n\u201cIt would list human beings in the same pages as farming instruments,\u201d said Ben Carton, a history professor who participated in the enslaved peoples project. \u201cHe bequeathed enslaved people, often by age, grade to his children. He never emancipated a single enslaved individual.\u201d\n\nThere are no markers on campus that tell their stories.\n\nFull of contradictions\n\nGeorge Mason University was originally established as a northern Virginia arm of the University of Virginia. It became an independent institution in 1972.\n\nThe University of Virginia has had to come to terms with its past. A commission in 2018 concluded slavery played an integral role in the institution\u2019s founding, according to a report by the school\u2019s President\u2019s Commission on Slavery and the University.\n\nWhile George Mason University\u2019s founding is not intertwined with slavery in the same way the University of Virginia\u2019s is, it\u2019s still part of the school\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cOur university is named after George Mason because he\u2019s a prominent figure in Virginia history and in American history,\u201d said Ayman Fatima, 21, a student researcher. \u201cNone of the work that he did would have been possible if not for the people that he enslaved, without all the work that they did and the suffering that they went through.\u201d\n\nMasonwas full of contradictions. In the Virginia Declaration of Rights, he asserted \u201call men are born equally free and independant [sic], and have certain inherent natural rights.\u201d\n\nMason opposed the slave trade that violently trafficked human beings between Africa, the Caribbean and the Americas. He questioned the institution\u2019s morality.\n\n\u201cHe owned over 100 enslaved individuals at a time when our Founding Fathers struggled with this system that our economy is based off of, but is morally wrong,\u201d Farrow said.\n\nBut Mason was also concerned that in some Virginia cities and counties, enslaved black people outnumbered whites, Farrow added.\n\nStill, he benefited from the men, women and children who were part of that trade.\n\nHis Gunston Hall home was opened to public in 1952. Staff don\u2019t shy away from Mason\u2019s slaveholding legacy, said Scott Stroh, the executive director.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about exploring the contradictions between Mason\u2019s words and his decisions and actions,\u201d Stroh said of the performances, exhibits and signage that explain slavery at the mansion. \u201cIt\u2019s something that evokes reactions that run the gamut. Overwhelmingly, it\u2019s something that our visitors are interested in and want to see and explore at Gunston Hall.\u201d\n\nConfronting history\n\nWhen the memorial opens, it will contain multiple markers, including a bronze statue of George Mason and silhouettes of Penny and James.\n\nHistorians don\u2019t know what Penny or James looked like.\n\n\u201cWe only have hints of the people,\u201d said Oberle, the university\u2019s history librarian. \u201cPart of the idea of the silhouettes is to force people to look through this lens and try to imagine yourselves in Penny\u2019s shoes or James\u2019 shoes.\u201d\n\nPenny and James\u2019 figures will be carved from large panels inscribed with the names of the men, women and children whom Mason enslaved. Of Mason\u2019s more than 100 slaves, half were under the age of 16.\n\nThe memorial was designed by Perkins and Will, an architecture firm based in D.C., and it will span about 300 feet in a courtyard on the Fairfax City campus. It is part of a larger revitalization effort at the school that includes infrastructure upgrades and new academic buildings.\n\nUniversity officials are trying to raise $500,000 to fund the memorial and an accompanying academic center for students and faculty to share research, said Julian Williams, the school\u2019s vice president of compliance, diversity and ethics.\n\nThe structure is designed to be an interactive experience for visitors, Oberle said. There will be openings in the \u201cPenny Panel\u201d and \u201cJames Panel\u201d for people to look through and observe the rest of the memorial. Bricks on the ground will instruct people where to stand and what to think about: \u201cConsider how slavery and freedom coexisted in America,\u201d one reads.\n\nA video on the school\u2019s YouTube page provides a virtual tour.\n\nThe research about Mason and the people he enslaved is ongoing, Oberle said. But information about Mason is scarce.\n\n\u201cGeorge Washington and Thomas Jefferson, they cultivated their papers, they built their papers. They saved them and they entrusted them to a trusted person in their family,\u201d Oberle said. \u201cBut George Mason doesn\u2019t have any of that.\u201d\n\nManuel-Scott credits the student researchers \u2014 Alexis Bracey, Elizabeth Perez-Garcia, Farhaj Murshed, Farrow and Fatima \u2014 for forcing their school to honor the enslaved. Over the summer of 2017, they unearthed details about Penny, the adult \u201cmanservant\u201d named James and dozens of other enslaved people held in captivity by Mason.\n\n\u201cWe are in a time where students are compelling us to courageously consider the relationship between the present and the past,\u201d Manuel-Scott said. \u201cI think, for many students, they\u2019ve been introduced to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson as slaveholders, but certainly Mason has received a sort of pass.\u201d\n\nGet updates on your area delivered via email\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The structure will span 300 feet and is expected to be unveiled on the Fairfax City campus in 2021.", "authors": ["Lauren Lumpkin", "Reporting Fellow Focusing On Local Education Issues", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/f4sIOLMRP4Zt_Kqvog8yCmmHIgw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2CF5OTXAWEI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
