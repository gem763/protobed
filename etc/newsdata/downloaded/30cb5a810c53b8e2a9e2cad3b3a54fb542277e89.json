(Brian Snyder/Reuters)\n\nA charismatic candidate develops a cult of personality, then uses the party apparatus as a platform not for any ideas, but rather to promote a celebrity brand.\n\nRobert \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke\u2019s biggest fans and supporters insist he is a forward-thinking, future-oriented visionary, but no contender for the Democratic nomination feels more familiar than the former three-term congressman from El Paso.\n\nThat\u2019s because he has the highest combined score in both d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and nostalgia, which are two different things. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is the unsettling sense that you are repeating a specific experience. Nostalgia is a kind of sentimentality, a homesickness for the past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the other straight white men officially or presumably vying for the nomination, only Senator Bernie Sanders (I.,Vt.) and former vice president Joe Biden can compete with O\u2019Rourke on these fronts.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu to the Sanders campaign, because it feels like it never really went away. When he announced for 2020, it was a here-we-go-again moment.\n\nBut Sanders\u2019 campaign isn\u2019t wrapped in nostalgia \u2014 even if Sanders himself is steeped in it, mostly for what he imagines Scandinavia was once like. What he represents is oddly new for such an old candidate. Sanders has been a thorn in the Democratic party\u2019s side for decades. His success at pulling the party to the socialist left in just a few years is too politically fresh to be a nostalgic appeal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow many people are old enough to even remember a previous era when \u201csocialist\u201d had a positive connotation among the hardcore Democratic base? Perhaps there are some fans of Henry Wallace, Eugene V. Debs, or Norman Thomas still with us, but Bernie\u2019s core supporters think socialism is about the future, not the past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s a lot of nostalgia to Biden, but not much d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, because he\u2019s never run for president when voters actually took him seriously.\n\nBiden conjures memories of several bygone eras. For some, he\u2019s a reminder of the Obama years, when progressives were never more sure history was on their side. For others, he\u2019s an icon of the old days when patronizing old white men were still the face of big-government liberalism. Also, Biden is positioning himself as a kind of Grandpa Joe who gets along with everyone, the way we imagine politicians did in the good old days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in the combined category, O\u2019Rourke wins the nostalgia-d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu biathlon by a mile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEverything about his candidacy feels like a triumph of nostalgia-peddling. The constant refrain that he\u2019s this generation\u2019s Robert F. Kennedy is an interesting play on the time-tested effort by Democratic candidates to claim the Kennedy mantle, though usually it\u2019s John F. Kennedy, not RFK. Then again, it makes sense given that RFK moved left of JFK \u2014 and so has the Democratic party.\n\nThere\u2019s also a shared authentic inauthenticity to O\u2019Rourke. Joe Kennedy groomed his boys for the presidency from an early age. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s dad assigned his son the nickname Beto almost from birth, because he thought it would help win votes in El Paso.\n\nLike a 1960s Kennedy, O\u2019Rourke is an old person\u2019s idea of what a young person is supposed to be like, albeit with a Gen X spin: skateboarding, membership in a punk band, etc. Sure, O\u2019Rourke was born the same year that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders first ran for the Senate, as a Democrat and social democrat, respectively. (Biden won.) But that only makes him young compared with those guys.\n\nThen there\u2019s the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s candidacy feels like a rerun, and not merely because the media covered his recently concluded Senate race against Ted Cruz as if it were a presidential contest. (A race, it\u2019s worth nothing, that O\u2019Rourke lost despite having raised more money than any Senate candidate ever, and despite the fact that his opponent was wildly unpopular.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, the real queasy feeling I get from the O\u2019Rourke candidacy is that this feels like the new normal: A charismatic candidate develops a cult of personality, then uses the party apparatus as a platform not for any ideas, but rather to promote a celebrity brand.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s not the only one doing it \u2014 that\u2019s the point \u2014 but he is the only one who has to. Because unlike his non-male, non-white opponents, he\u2019s got nothing else to fall back on.\n\n\u00a9 2019 Tribune Content Agency LLC", "description": "The constant refrain that he\u2019s this generation\u2019s Robert F.
