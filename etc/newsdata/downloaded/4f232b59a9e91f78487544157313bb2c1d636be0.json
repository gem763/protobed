People in our country work some of the the longest hours in Europe. And since the 1980s the link between increasing productivity and expanded free time has been broken. It\u2019s time to put that right.\n\n\u201cSo I can tell you today that the next Labour government will reduce the average full-time working week to 32 hours within the next decade. It will be a shorter working week with no loss of pay.\u201d\n\nMr McDonnell said that as a first step, a Labour government would end the UK\u2019s opt-out from the European Working Time Directive.\n\n\n\nLabour would introduce a requirement for working hours to be included in legally-binding sectoral agreements, allowing unions and employers to decide together how best to reduce hours in their industry.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Introducing more public holidays and enforcing safe limits on working hours is a sensible start.\n\n\u201cUnions already negotiate agreements on working time in many workplaces. With greater freedom to bargain across sectors, we can help deliver a flexible transition that meets the needs of workers and businesses across different industries.\u201d\n\nMr McDonnell also announced the launch of a paper on Universal Basic Services, setting out Labour's belief that \"everyone has a right to a good life\" and that the state has the responsibility to deliver it by providing public services free at the point of use.\n\nDenouncing the closure and sell-off of parks, libraries, leisure centres and swimming pools under coalition and Conservative governments, he said: \"These services are part of our shared experiences. Experiences that are too important to be left to the vagaries of the market. Whether a family can afford them or not.\n\n\"As socialists we believe that people have the right to education, health, a home in a decent safe environment and, yes, access to culture and recreation.\"", "description": "A Labour government will reduce the average full-time working week to 32 hours with no loss of pay within the next decade, shadow chancellor John McDonnell has announced.
