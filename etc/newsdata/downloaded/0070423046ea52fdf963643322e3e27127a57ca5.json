A month ago, 22 people were killed in a shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, an incident that's being treated as domestic terrorism. And, four days earlier, a disgruntled employee killed two Walmart workers in Southaven, Miss.\n\n\"It's clear to us that the status quo is unacceptable,\" McMillon wrote in Tuesday's memo. It marks one of the strongest statements from Walmart, the powerful, largest retailer in the U.S.\n\nWalmart plans to stop selling ammunition for handguns and short-barrel rifles, which are commonly used for hunting, but they can also be used with military-style weapons. Walmart will also phase out the sale of handguns in the only state where it still sells them, Alaska.\n\nWalmart says its current market share in ammunition is about 20% and the new cutbacks will reduce its profile in that market to around 6% to 9%.\n\nThe retailer is also asking shoppers to refrain from openly carrying guns in its stores even if cities and states allow guns in stores \u2014 unless they're authorized law enforcement officers.\n\n\"We know these decisions will inconvenience some of our customers, and we hope they will understand,\" McMillon wrote, adding that Walmart's retail focus will now shift further to \"the needs of hunting and sport shooting enthusiasts.\"\n\nThe moves are the most far-reaching move by Walmart since the El Paso shooting, which prompted loud calls from gun-control advocates, Democratic politicians and some shoppers and employees for the retailer to stop all gun sales.\n\nLast month, Walmart instructed workers to take down displays of video games with violent imagery and make sure none of the screens in stores display violence.\n\nWalmart's most significant decision on gun sales came in 2015, when the retailer quietly stopped selling military-style, or assault-style, rifles. The retailer cited weak sales.\n\nLast year, Walmart also stopped selling guns and ammunition to people younger than 21 on the same day when Dick's Sporting Goods announced that it would stop selling military-style rifles and end sales of guns and ammo those under 21.\n\nAt the time, Dick's took a political stand on the issue, with CEO Ed Stack calling for \"common-sense reforms,\" stricter background checks and other changes to gun laws. The shooter at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., had purchased a different gun, not used in the shooting, at Dick's.\n\nOn Tuesday, Walmart's McMillon said that he's also writing to Congress and the White House, urging action on \"common sense measures.\" He called for more debate on the re-authorization of the assault-weapons ban.\n\n\"We encourage our nation's leaders to move forward and strengthen background checks and to remove weapons from those who have been determined to pose an imminent danger,\" he wrote. \"As we've seen before, these horrific events occur and then the spotlight fades. We should not allow that to happen.\"\n\nEditor's note: Walmart is among NPR's recent sponsors.", "description": "Walmart will phase out handgun and short-barrel rifle ammunition.
