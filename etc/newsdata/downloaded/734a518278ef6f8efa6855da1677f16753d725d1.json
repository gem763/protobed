(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nHere are the biggest moments from the Redskins\u2019 24-3 loss to the Giants on Sunday at MetLife Stadium. Scroll down to see a full recap of the game.\n\nCase Keenum throws an early interception (14:00 First Quarter): Keenum picked up where he left off on Monday, when he committed five turnovers in a loss to the Bears. On third-and-five on the opening drive of the game, the veteran tried to force a pass to wide receiver Robert Davis on a slant route, but Giants cornerback Janoris Jenkins deflected the pass into the hands of rookie linebacker Ryan Connelly. The Redskins\u2019s first drive against Chicago ended with a Keenum interception that was returned for a touchdown. His latest pick gave New York a short field.\n\nJay Gruden accepts holding penalty (12:35 First Quarter): Looking to capitalize on the early turnover, Giants rookie quarterback Daniel Jones threw incomplete on third-and-seven from the Washington 29-yard line. New York was called for holding on the play, and rather than decline the 10-yard penalty to bring up fourth down, Redskins Coach Jay Gruden accepted it. The decision was defensible, as it could have taken New York out of field goal range, but it backfired for Washington. On the ensuing third-and-17, Jones connected with running back Wayne Gallman for 15 yards. Giants Coach Pat Shurmur left his offense on the field on fourth-and-short, and Jones found Sterling Shepard for a six-yard gain. New York scored a touchdown six plays later.\n\nWayne Gallman scores his second touchdown (12:01 Second Quarter): Saquon Barkley, who rushed for 170 yards against the Redskins last December, was sidelined with a high-ankle sprain, but his replacement, Gallman, was more than adequate on Sunday. The Giants took a 14-0 lead early in the second quarter after Gallman\u2019s one-yard touchdown run, which was set up by his 22-yard catch earlier in the drive. Gallman, who finished with 118 total yards, opened the scoring with a six-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter.\n\nKeenum overthrows Trey Quinn (8:17 Second Quarter): On the first play after cornerback Quinton Dunbar intercepted Jones at the Washington 47-yard line, Quinn beat Giants cornerback Grant Haley with a hesitation move and was streaking down the middle of the field. Keenum saw Quinn, but just as he did on the Redskins\u2019 first play from scrimmage, he badly overthrew him, and what should have been a touchdown pass fell incomplete. Washington punted two plays later.\n\nRedskins settle for a field goal on Dwayne Haskins\u2019s first drive (2:14 Second Quarter): With Keenum struggling for a second straight week, Gruden made a switch at quarterback midway through the second quarter. Haskins, Washington\u2019s rookie first-round pick, completed his first two throws, and his 14-yard scramble gave the Redskins a first-and-goal from the one-yard line. After Haskins threw an incompletion in the end zone and Adrian Peterson was dropped for a loss of two yards, Gruden called another pass play on third down. Vernon Davis had some separation from his defender on an out route, but Haskins\u2019s pass sailed wide of the mark, and Washington settled for three points.\n\nWashington forces a fumble at the goal line (2:02 Third Quarter): Four plays after allowing Jones to avoid what should have been a third-down sack and scramble for 16 yards, the Redskins\u2019 defense made a play. Tim Settle knocked the ball loose from rookie running back Jonathan Hilliman at the 5-yard line and safety Montae Nicholson recovered. The Redskins still trailed 17-3 late in the third quarter, but they had hope.\n\nHaskins throws a pick-six (1:19 Third Quarter): Haskins connected with Jeremy Sprinkle for a 20-yard gain after Hilliman\u2019s fumble, but he showed his inexperience when he looked Sprinkle\u2019s way again on the next play. Sprinkle was well covered by safety Jabrill Peppers, but Haskins threw in his direction anyway. Peppers jumped the route to make the interception and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.\n\nHaskins throws another interception (3:00 Fourth Quarter): Keenum\u2019s ugly start left Gruden with little choice but to make a change, but Haskins\u2019s performance made it clear the rookie has a ways to go in his development. Haskins missed open receivers and held the ball too long in the pocket at times. On the play that resulted in his third and final interception, his timing with tight end Vernon Davis was out of sync.\n\n\n\nWashington Redskins tight end Vernon Davis (85) on the bench during Sunday's loss. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nFinal: Giants 24, Redskins 3\n\nDwayne Haskins replaced an ineffective Case Keenum at quarterback midway through the second quarter and the Redskins trailing 14-0. The rookie first-round pick struggled in his NFL debut, completing 9 of 17 passes for 107 yards and three interceptions. He was also sacked twice.\n\nThe Giants converted eight of their 13 third-down opportunities against the league\u2019s worst third-down defense. Rookie quarterback Daniel Jones was 23 for 31 for 225 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.\n\nWashington rushed for 55 yards on 17 carries and managed only 176 total yards against the league\u2019s 31st-ranked defense.\n\nNew York rushed for 164 yards on 37 carries without star running back Saquon Barkley, who was sidelined with a high-ankle sprain. Wayne Gallman rushed for a game-high 63 yards and a touchdown, and also had a touchdown catch.\n\nThe Redskins, who committed 12 penalties, fell to 0-4 for the first time since 2001.\n\nFourth Quarter\n\nDwayne Haskins throws third interception: The Giants giveth, the Giants taketh away. The timing between Haskins and tight end Vernon Davis was off on a comeback route, resulting in the rookie quarterback\u2019s third interception of the game. Haskins was just a second early with the throw, which deflected off Davis\u2019s shoulder pads and into the hands of Janoris Jenkins. (Giants 24, Redskins 3, 2:48 Fourth Quarter)\n\nRedskins force fourth turnover: Washington is winning the turnover battle, if nothing else, after Redskins rookie linebacker Cole Holcomb forced a fumble by running back Wayne Gallman the Giants\u2019 36-yard line. That\u2019s two fumbles lost and two interceptions for New York, which has a comfortable advantage on the scoreboard. (Giants 24, Redskins 3, 3:45 Fourth Quarter)\n\nDwayne Haskins throws another interception: After the Redskins\u2019 defense forced a three-and-out for the first time today, Washington advanced into Giants territory on a 39-yard catch-and-run by Chris Thompson. On the next play, Dwayne Haskins threw deep along the right sideline for Paul Richardson, but cornerback Janoris Jenkins was in good position and made a leaping interception. Haskins is 8 for 14 for 101 yards and two picks. (Giants 24, Redskins 3, 10:29 Fourth Quarter)\n\nRedskins punt after two more costly penalties: Washington\u2019s 10th penalty of the game, a holding call on Deshazor Everett, wiped out an 81-yard kickoff return by rookie Steven Sims Jr. During the ensuing drive, a delay-of-game penalty on the Redskins resulted in a third-and-long situation. Dwayne Haskins was sacked on the next play. (Giants 24, Redskins 3, 13:35 Fourth Quarter)\n\n\n\nWashington Redskins quarterback Dwayne Haskins (7) scrambles out of the pocket during Sunday's game. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nThird Quarter\n\nGiants extend lead on interception return for a touchdown: One play after Dwayne Haskins connected with Jeremy Sprinkle for a 20-yard gain, the rookie looked the tight end\u2019s way again. This time, Sprinkle didn\u2019t have any separation from his defender, and Giants safety Jabrill Peppers intercepted the pass before returning it 32 yards for a touchdown. (Giants 24, Redskins 3, 1:19 Third Quarter)\n\nWashington comes up with another turnover: The Giants had a chance to ice the game, but on second-and-goal, rookie running back Jonathan Hilliman had the ball knocked loose by Tim Settle, and safety Montae Nicholson recovered for the Redskins. It was redemption for a Washington defense that, minutes earlier, somehow allowed Daniel Jones to scramble for 16 yards on third-and-13 after Ryan Anderson and Matt Ioannidis whiffed on sacking the rookie quarterback. (Giants 17, Redskins 3, 1:55 Third Quarter)\n\nRedskins go three-and-out: Washington didn\u2019t have any success running the ball in the first half and that continued on its first drive of the third quarter, as Adrian Peterson was stopped for a gain of one on first down. Dwayne Haskins completed a six-yard pass to Paul Richardson on the next play, but the rookie was flushed out of the pocket and eventually threw the ball away on third down, bringing on Tress Way for his fourth punt. Missing two starters along the offensive line, the Redskins have 12 carries for 37 yards rushing as a team. (Giants 17, Redskins 3, 8:58 Third Quarter)\n\nWashington gets a stop on Giants\u2019 first drive of the second half: After a holding penalty on offensive lineman Mike Remmers negated an 11-yard run by Daniel Jones for a first down on third-and-long, the Redskins\u2019 defense held and forced the first punt of the game by Riley Dixon. (Giants 17, Redskins 3, 10:08 Third Quarter)\n\nHalftime: Giants 17, Redskins 3\n\nNew York has outgained Washington, 233-86, and has converted on 4 of 5 third-down opportunities. Daniel Jones is 13 for 19 for 137 yards, one touchdown and the first two interceptions of his career. Dwayne Haskins replaced Case Keenum at quarterback midway through the second quarter and went 2 for 4 for 15 yards on his first drive.\n\nSecond Quarter\n\nGiants extend lead with a field goal: Aldrick Rosas capped a 10-play, 63-yard drive with a 30-yard field goal as time expired in the first half to give the Giants a 14-point lead. Josh Norman had a chance to end the drive when he jumped in front of a pass intended for Bennie Fowler, but he couldn\u2019t maintain control of the ball as he hit the ground. (Giants 17, Redskins 3, End of First Half)\n\nDwayne Haskins leads a scoring drive: Haskins completed the first two passes of his NFL career, a nine-yard gain to fellow rookie Kelvin Harmon and a six-yard gain to Trey Quinn. On second-and-long, he showed off his legs, scrambling 14 yards to the Giants\u2019 one-yard line. After safety Jabrill Peppers broke up a potential touchdown pass to tight end Jeremy Sprinkle and Adrian Peterson was tackled for a loss, Haskins led tight end Vernon Davis too much on an out route, and Washington settled for a short Dustin Hopkins field goal. (Giants 14, Redskins 3, 2:14 Second Quarter)\n\nDwayne Haskins is in the game for Washington: After Quinton Dunbar\u2019s second interception of the quarter, the rookie first-round pick came on in relief of an ineffective Case Keenum to start the Redskins\u2019s next drive. Ready or not, the future is now for Washington. (Giants 14, Redskins 0, 6:35 Second Quarter)\n\nRedskins fail to capitalize on turnover: With pressure in his face, Daniel Jones forced a throw to Sterling Shephard that was intercepted by Quinton Dunbar and returned to the Washington 47-yard line. The Redskins wasted their best field position of the game, as Case Keenum overthrew a wide open Trey Quinn on a stop-and-go route that should\u2019ve been a touchdown on first down and were forced to punt two plays later. Keenum also overthrew Quinn on a potential big gain on the first play of the game. The Redskins have one first down. (Giants 14, Redskins 0, 7:16 Second Quarter)\n\nRedskins go three-and-out: Six minutes into the second quarter, Washington has committed seven penalties, including a holding call on Morgan Moses that put the Redskins behind the chains to start their third drive of the afternoon. On third-and-eight from the Washington 21-yard line, Case Keenum completed a pass to Chris Thompson over the middle, but the running back was stopped well short of the first-down marker. The Redskins have managed 47 total yards against a defense that came in allowing 460 per game. (Giants 14, Redskins 0, 9:08 Second Quarter)\n\nWayne Gallman gives Giants a two-touchdown lead: Filling in at running back for the injured Saquon Barkley, Gallman capped New York\u2019s second drive with his second touchdown of the day, a one-yard run that came one play after Montae Nicholson was called for defensive holding in the end zone. Gallman had a 22-yard catch earlier in the march, a play that left Redskins cornerback Josh Norman in the medical tent on the sideline. The Giants are 3 for 4 on third down and Daniel Jones is 9 for 11 for 89 yards. (Giants 14, Redskins 0, 12:01 Second Quarter)\n\nFirst Quarter\n\nNew York is on the move again: Washington\u2019s defense appeared to have a rare third-down stop when Matt Ioannidis, Daron Payne and Jon Bostic combined to sack Daniel Jones at the Giants\u2019 23-yard line, but cornerback Fabian Moreau was called for defensive holding on the play, giving New York a fresh set of downs. The Giants will resume their drive in Redskins territory when the second quarter begins. (Giants 7, Redskins 0, End of First Quarter)\n\nRedskins\u2019 offense is out of sync early: Geron Christian committed a holding penalty and Donald Penn was whistled for a false start on consecutive plays, setting up a first-and-23 situation on Washington\u2019s second drive that the Redskins couldn\u2019t overcome. Case Keenum is 3 for 6 for 24 yards with an interception thus far. He\u2019s also been sacked once. (Giants 7, Redskins 0, 4:00 First Quarter)\n\nGiants capitalize on early turnover: Rookie quarterback Daniel Jones found running back Wayne Gallman wide open in the flat for a six-yard touchdown pass to cap New York\u2019s eight-play, 32-yard drive after Washington\u2019s turnover. The Redskins had a chance to force the Giants to settle for a long field goal early in the march, but after Jay Gruden elected to accept a 10-yard offensive holding penalty, Jones and Gallman hooked up for a 15-yard gain on third-and-17 from the Washington 39-yard line. Giants Coach Pat Shurmur left his offense on the field on fourth down, and New York moved the chains with Jones\u2019s 5-yard completion to Sterling Shepard. (Giants 7, Redskins 0, 8:45 First Quarter)\n\nCase Keenum throws an interception on first possession: The Giants won the coin toss and deferred, giving the Redskins the ball first. Washington would give it right back. The Redskins\u2019 first drive ended the same way it did on Sunday, with a Keenum interception. On third-and-five, Keenum tried to fine wide receiver Robert Davis on a slant, but cornerback Janoris Jenkins got his hand on the ball and the deflection fell into the arms of linebacker Ryan Connelly at the Redskins\u2019 32-yard line. (Redskins 0, Giants 0, 14:00 First Quarter)\n\nPregame update\n\nThe Washington Redskins will be without their leading receiver, rookie Terry McLaurin, who was questionable with a hamstring injury. Right guard Brandon Scherff, who was questionable with an ankle injury, is also out. With center Chase Roullier ruled out earlier in the week, Washington is down two starters along the offensive line. Veteran Tony Bergstrom will start in place of Roullier, while rookie fourth-round draft pick Wes Martin will make his NFL debut at right guard in place of Scherff.", "description": "Rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins was ineffective during his NFL debut, which came after he replaced starter Case Keenum in the second quarter.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
