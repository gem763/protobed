It was a staggering run considering the fact that players of the calibre of Rory Mcilroy - who shot a three-over 73 - struggled to make any headway on the Narashino Country Club.\n\nOn six-under after his 64, Woods is sharing the lead with countryman Gary Woodland and is the favourite to win his 82nd PGA Tour crown, so tying Sam Snead\u2019s record. Woods believes his fifth knee surgery - which repaired cartilage damage - was a huge success, removing the pain that bothered him for a year to such an extent that he overcompensated in his swing, leading to further back issues.", "description": "As if 2019 was not to be remembered as the year of the Tiger Woods comeback anyway, the 15-time major winner set out on Thursday to make sure with a stunning turnaround in his first tournament in nine weeks following his latest knee operation.", "authors": ["James Corrigan", "Golf Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/golf/2019/10/24/TELEMMGLPICT000213963631-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZjHC1CawyhCYfmdoGgKrwCVNHl9S--FzbjYEKI6ecJw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
