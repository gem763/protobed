(Sotheby's Institute of Art offers similar types of classes, both online and in person in London and New York, as well.)\n\nHildreth blends the entertaining format of a talk show, featuring interviews with brand visionaries, with easy-to-understand technical presentations enhanced with custom graphics and storytelling featuring anecdotes and milestones in watchmaking history.\n\n\u201cSome of the stories around Rolex are not only entertaining but hard to believe in this day and age,\u201d says Hildreth, speaking by phone from London. \u201cThings like [Rolex founder] Hans Wilsdorf sending British POWs watches and telling them they could pay for them after the war.\u201d\n\nU.K. independent watch consultant and author Andrew Hildreth, who wrote and presents the five-week video program. Christie's\n\nHildreth adds that such pieces were used in the 1944 breakout of Stalag Luft III, immortalized in the 1963 Steve McQueen film The Great Escape. \u201cIt now adds to the mystique of the marque, but Wilsdorf didn\u2019t know that back then.\u201d\n\nEach hour-long video lecture is produced to educate and enlighten both the curious novice as well as experienced collectors. The five-part series will repeat again in Nov., Jan. 2020, an Apr. 2020.\n\nSession 1 focuses on the engineering of a mechanical watch movement, broken down and made more approachable with visual animations that clearly illustrate the mechanism\u2019s interplay of moving parts.\n\nThe following weeks cover wristwatch design, an overview of prominent brands of the 20th and 21st centuries, the Quartz Crisis that decimated mechanical watchmaking in the 1970s and \u201980s, and the red-hot vintage market that continues to set sales records.\n\nHildreth traces the advancement of watches from the earliest pocket watches to today\u2019s high-tech complications, looking at how the industry has evolved from discussions with prominent designers and historians.\n\nSpecial features include sit-downs with Emmanuel Breguet of Breguet, Pascale Lepeu of Cartier, Stephen Forsey of Greubel Forsey, Richard Mille, and more, providing insight into their views of 21st-century horology and design, technical advancements, and their respective brand\u2019s inspirations and guiding principles.\n\n\u201cAs I worked on the lectures, I was able to bring together themes and threads in the history of watches, such as how the wristwatch has evolved into the form and shape it holds today,\u201d Hildreth said in a news release. \u201cAnd of course, not just the watch itself, but also how the industry and wearers\u2019 preferences have changed over the past century or so.\u201d", "description": "The $1,500, five-week program looks at watch history and engineering", "authors": ["Laurie Kahle"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-107526/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
