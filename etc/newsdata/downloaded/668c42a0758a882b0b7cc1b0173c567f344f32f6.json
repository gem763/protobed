Kornmesser\n\nScientists have made the first successful detection of an atmosphere with water vapour around the exoplanet K2-18 b. What's significant about this is that K2-18 b is a non-gaseous \"super-Earth\" located within the habitable zone of its star. Put simply, we have detected water on a potentially habitable planet for the first time.\n\nWith more than 4000 exoplanets \u2013 planets orbiting stars other than our sun \u2013 discovered so far, it may seem like we are on the cusp of finding out whether we are alone in the universe. Sadly though, we don\u2019t know much about these planets \u2013 in most cases just their mass and their radius.\n\nUnderstanding whether a planet could host life requires a lot more information. At the moment, one extremely important piece of information that is missing is the presence, composition and structure of their atmospheres. Signs of atmospheric water, oxygen and methane would all be signs that a planet may support life.\n\nNow we have for the first time managed to detect water vapour in the atmosphere of an exoplanet that is potentially habitable. Our results have been published in Nature Astronomy.\n\nA planet\u2019s atmosphere plays a vital role in shaping the conditions inside it \u2013 or on its surface, if it has one. Its composition, stability and structure all provide important clues about what it is like to be there. Through atmospheric studies, we can therefore learn about the history of the planet, investigate its habitability and, ultimately, discover signs of life.\n\nThe primary method that we use when examining exoplanets is transit spectroscopy. This involves looking at starlight as a planet passes in front of its host star. As it transits, stellar light is filtered through the planet\u2019s atmosphere \u2013 with light being absorbed or deflected based on what compounds the atmosphere consists of.\n\nThe atmosphere therefore leaves a characteristic footprint in the stellar light that we try to observe. Further analysis can then help us match this footprint to known elements and molecules, such as water or methane.\n\nAt the moment, the study of exoplanets atmospheres is limited, as this kind of measurement requires very high precision, which current instruments were not built to deliver. But molecular signatures from water have been found in the atmospheres of gaseous planets, similar to Jupiter or Neptune. It has never before been seen in smaller planets \u2013 until now.\n\nK2-18 b\n\nK2-18 b was discovered in 2015 and is one of hundreds of \u201csuper-Earths\u201d \u2013 planets with a mass between Earth and Neptune \u2013 found by NASA\u2019s Kepler spacecraft. It is a planet with eight times the mass of the Earth that orbits a so called \u201cred dwarf\u201d star, which is much cooler than the sun.\n\nHowever, K2-18b is located in the \u201chabitable zone\u201d of its star which means it has the right temperature to support liquid water. Given its mass and radius, K2-18 b is not a gaseous planet, but has a high probability of having a rocky surface.\n\nWe developed algorithms to analyse the starlight filtered by this planet using transit spectroscopy, with data provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.", "description": "Scientists have made the first successful detection of an atmosphere with water vapour around the exoplanet K2-18 b.
