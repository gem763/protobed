Now the school is being forced to vacate the title after self reporting an NCAA violation\n\nCrusaders coach Pete Fredenburg admitting to unintentionally breaking NCAA rules\n\n'I've spent my entire career as a football coach investing in kids,' Fredenburg said. 'In this instance, I unintentionally broke NCAA rules. I regret this, and I accept responsibility.'\n\nThe school previously suspended Fredenburg for the three months without pay and he sat out the first three games of the 2018 season.\n\nThe university said it will appeal the NCAA's punishment.\n\n'UMHB learned of potential rules violations in its football program in March 2018 and immediately launched an in-depth investigation, which concluded with the submission of a comprehensive self-report to the NCAA's enforcement office in April 2018,' read the school's statement.\n\n'The NCAA's Committee on Infractions released its report today and accepted all of UMHB's corrective actions and self-imposed penalties, which included a two-year probation period for the football program, enhanced compliance training, and a $2,500 fine,' the statement continued. 'Head Coach Pete Fredenburg also received a three-month suspension without pay and a three-game suspension at the beginning of the 2018 season.\n\n'However, the COI added a penalty of vacating wins and records during the 2016 and 2017 football seasons, including the 2016 DIII National Championship, which UMHB will appeal.'\n\nThe exact model of the Subaru has not been revealed (Pictured: A 2006 Subaru Forrester)\n\nSince 2004, the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor football team has reached the Division III national championship four times, winning twice. However, the 2016 title has been vacated\n\nIn the statement, school president Randy O'Rear stressed that the UMHB cooperated with the NCAA throughout its investigation.\n\n'Although the university recognized the seriousness of the violations it has self-reported, it respectfully disagreed with the Committee on Infractions decision to add to our self-imposed sanctions the vacating of wins and records for the 2016 and 2017 football seasons,' said O'Rear. 'In light of all the circumstances surrounding this case and as a matter of principle for all the student-athletes who had no part in the infractions, we requested an expedited hearing on that one issue of disagreement.\n\nMARY HARDIN-BAYLOR FOOTBALL TEAM STRIPPED OF TITLE OVER IMPROPER USE OF A 2006 SUBARU The punishments against the UMHB football team include: Two years of probation (self-imposed by the university).\n\nA vacation of records in which any ineligible student-athletes competed.\n\nA $2,500 fine (self-imposed by the university).\n\nOutside audit of the college\u2019s athletics policies and procedures to ensure that they are consistent with institutional guidelines and NCAA Division III rules (self-imposed by the university).\n\nA three-month suspension of the head coach and a suspension for the first three contests of the 2018 season (self-imposed by the university).\n\nMandatory attendance for the head coach at a 2018 NCAA Regional Rules Seminar and attendance during each year of probation (self-imposed by the university).\n\nMandatory attendance for all assistant football coaches, including the recruiting and academic coordinator, at a Regional Rules Seminar during probation. (Source: NCAA.org)\n\n'Mary Hardin-Baylor is committed to a culture of compliance, and the actions we took reflect that commitment,' O'Rear continued. 'The record shows we responded quickly, investigated vigorously, immediately self-reported the violations, and independently took decisive corrective steps.'\n\nThe compensation of student athletes has been a major issue in collegiate sports.\n\nRecently California governor Gavin Newsom signed the first law in the nation on allowing college athletes to hire agents and make money from endorsements - a move that prompted the NCAA to threaten to ban the state's college athletic programs.\n\nThe NCAA claimed the new law is 'creating confusion for current and future student-athletes, coaches, administrators and campuses, and not just in California.'\n\nUnder the law, which takes effect in 2023, students at public and private universities in the state will be allowed to sign deals with sneaker manufacturers, soft drink makers or other businesses and profit from their images, names or likenesses, just like the pros.\n\nThis law does not permit colleges to pay athletes directly. Rather, it simply bans schools from kicking athletes off the team if they get paid endorsement money. It does not apply to community colleges and bars athletes from accepting endorsement deals that conflict with their schools' existing contracts.\n\nNCAA president Mark Emmert reportedly told a group of athletic directors in September that California's 'fair play' law was an 'existential threat' to the current collegiate sports model.\n\nThe NCAA had asked Newsom to veto the bill, saying it 'would erase the critical distinction between college and professional athletes.' The board also warned that the law would give California universities an unfair recruiting advantage, which could prompt the NCAA to bar them from competition.", "description": "The NCAA has ordered the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor in Belton, Texas to vacate its 2016 Division III football national title because the head coach improperly lent a player his 2006 Subaru.", "authors": ["Alex Raskin Sports News Editor For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/17/19598414-0-image-a-12_1570810910854.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
