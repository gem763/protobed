On Thursday, the day after the new cabinet was announced, the President stressed co-ordinating ministers will have the final say on policy. This means Co-ordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Mohammad Mahfud MD, commonly known as Mahfud MD, will have veto power over Prabowo.", "description": "Retired general Prabowo Subianto, a polarising figure banned from Australia until 2014, is now Indonesia's Defence Minister.
