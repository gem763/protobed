I have to be honest that where the idea of getting on the road to fight two elections in 20 months would once have fired me up, the threat of spending hundreds of hours away from my home and family now fills me with dread. That is no way to lead.\"\n\nShe insisted she would \"continue to support the prime minister\" but noted: \"While I have not hidden the conflict I have felt over Brexit, I have attempted to chart a course for our party which recognizes and respects the referendum result, while seeking to maximize opportunities and mitigate risks for key Scottish businesses and sectors.\"\n\nDavidson has been a vocal critic of Johnson and backed Jeremy Hunt in the recent Conservative leadership contest. She insisted she would not back a no-deal Brexit just after Johnson became prime minister last month.\n\nShe was also said to have been angered after he sacked her ally David Mundell as secretary of state for Scotland. Meanwhile, Johnson is seen as toxic by voters north of the border, where 62 percent of voters opted to stay in the EU in 2016.\n\nDavidson issued a warning in her resignation statement that the U.K. would only be able to unite in the wake of the Brexit vote if those on either side of the political debate respect each other.\n\n\u201cTwo referenda have split Scotland and, indeed, opinion in the U.K. I am convinced that referenda should be used to affirm public opinion but not as a way for political leaders to fail to lead,\" she said.\n\n\u201cRespect is what missing from our debates and without respect you cannot understand and you cannot unite which is what we in Scotland and the U.K. need to do.\u201d\n\nDavidson is widely credited as having saved the 2017 election for Theresa May after 13 Tory MPs were elected in Scottish constituencies \u2014 the highest number in decades.\n\nThe party also overtook Labour as the second largest party in Holyrood under her tenure.", "description": "Davidson is widely credited as having saved the 2017 election for Theresa May", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio", "Charlie Cooper", "Paul Dallison"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1149491676-1200x628.jpg"}
