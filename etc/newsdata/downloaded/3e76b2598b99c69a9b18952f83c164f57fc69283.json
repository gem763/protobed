AAPL 1.41% (hardware-wise) on Tuesday and, in that respect, it didn\u2019t disappoint. The company delivered upgrades to last year\u2019s three iPhone models, plus some minor tweaks to the Apple Watch and iPad lines and an update on its coming subscription services.\n\nThe biggest news was that the company reduced the cost barrier for some of its devices, by bringing the iPhone 8 (with wireless charging) and the iPhone XR (with Face ID) down $150.\n\nStill, there are some new features. Here\u2019s a look at how the phones compare:\n\niPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max\n\nAt the top of the line, these models will have the high-resolution OLED screens, wireless charging and Face ID we have seen since the iPhone X, and the larger 6.5-inch option that first appeared last year. As usual, it has the newest processor\u2014Apple is now up to the A13.\n\nWhat else? Most obviously, there are now three cameras on the back, instead of two. In addition to a telephoto and standard wide-angle lens, both iPhone 11 Pro models have an ultrawide-angle lens. This means three different options for framing camera shots\u2014even 4K videos. You can take those blurry-background portrait shots with the wide or telephoto lenses. Apple said all of the cameras will be better at lowlight shooting (a long-overdue improvement), and this fall, the company plans to roll out a Deep Fusion mode, which combines multiple shots into an optimized master shot.\n\nIn addition to a telephoto and standard wide-angle lens, the iPhone 11 Pro models have an ultrawide-angle lens.

Apple said the Pro will deliver up to four more hours of battery life a day than the XS\u2014and that boost is five hours when you compare the 11 Pro Max to last year\u2019s iPhone XS Max. Apple also said these phones would have fast chargers in the box. No more rinky-dink 5-watt charger. But how fast?\n\nWe will have to test that during our reviews, naturally, along with other key bullet points from Apple: These phones have \u201cthe toughest glass ever in a smartphone,\u201d and are even more water-resistant than the previous generation.\n\nStill, they sure do look like last year\u2019s flagships. And Apple didn\u2019t mention some advanced smartphone features found in competing products from Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. for instance, such as in-screen fingerprint scanning (as an alternative to Face ID), reverse wireless charging (to give juice to your AirPods, for instance) and 5G wireless connectivity (an admittedly not-ready-for-primetime feature).\n\niPhone 11\n\nMercifully not called the XI or, even worse, the XIR, the standard iPhone 11 is the upgrade to last year\u2019s iPhone XR. The XR sticks around for $599, but Apple gave the 11 a seemingly reasonable price tag of its own: $699.\n\nApple didn\u2019t mention some advanced smartphone features found in competing products at the event.

Like its more expensive siblings, the 11 will have the improved \u201cNight Mode\u201d lowlight shooting, and will get that funky Deep Fusion mode later this fall.\n\nUnder the hood, the iPhone 11\u2019s battery lasts an hour longer a day than its predecessor. That is admirable, considering how much Personal Tech columnist Joanna Stern raved about the XR\u2019s battery. And like last year\u2019s surprise winner, this model is looking like Joanna\u2019s all-around pick\u2014pending review, of course.\n\niPhone XR and iPhone 8\n\nIn the U.S., Apple is keeping the iPhone XR, 8 and 8 Plus in circulation. That means total confusion around what model you should buy but also more higher-tech options at the lower end. Do you want wireless charging? No? Too bad, because there is no current iPhone without it. Water-resistant? Ditto.\n\nApple's Phil Schiller showed off the iPhone lineup on Tuesday. Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nFor people who are facing an upgrade, it also almost certainly means getting with Apple\u2019s latest program: bigger screens and Face ID.\n\nLike Samsung before it, Apple is making its iPhone screens larger. There is now only one option with a screen that measures less than 5 inches diagonally. (It is the $449 iPhone 8.) And that is only one of two remaining phones with the Touch ID fingerprint scanner. (The other is the iPhone 8 Plus which, at $549, is very much in No Man\u2019s Land.)\n\nWe will have more to tell you once we\u2019re testing these phones. Many other new features will come with the free iOS 13 upgrade, expected to also roll out next week, which might solve any or all of your current needs. But if you\u2019re stuck with a tough decision after today\u2019s news, shoot us a note at personaltech@wsj.com, and maybe we can help.\n\nWrite to Wilson Rothman at Wilson.Rothman@wsj.com", "description": "Apple\u2019s event brought unsurprising hardware tweaks along with a few surprising price changes.
