Following the invasion of Iraq by the US in 2003 and President Bush\u2019s move to disband the country\u2019s military, he found himself locked in jail accused of having links to al-Qaeda. Languishing in a cell at Camp Bucca, Qardash formed a close bond with Baghdadi, who was then fomenting the extremist religious code that would provide the ideological grounding for the death cult that became ISIS. After his release Qardash served as a religious commissar and a general sharia judge for al-Qaeda, according to researchers at the S. Rajartnam School of International Studies in Singapore. When ISIS emerged as a splinter group from Al-Qaeda\u2019s Syrian branch he changed allegiances, where he became Baghdadi\u2019s enforcer.\n\nQardash reportedly developed a reputation as a strict enforcer of the Islamic State\u2019s brand of sharia (Muslim law) and a sense of brutal legislative devotion, earning him the nickname \u201cProfessor.\u201d He holds a degree in \u201cIslamic sciences\u201d from a university in Mosul. He is also known as \u201cThe Destroyer\u201d for his brutal treatment of Baghdadi\u2019s internal adversaries.\n\nAmaq reported in August that Baghdadi, who was thought to be in failing health, had named Qardash as his successor and transferred some operational control of the Islamic State\u2019s remnants to him.\n\nIn addition to his military background and credentials in Islamic law, Qardash is said to be descended from the Quraysh tribe \u2014 in other words, part of the extended family of Islam\u2019s founder Mohammed. Baghdadi\u2019s claim to such lineage was an important part of his perceived legitimacy as the \u201ccaliph\u201d of the Islamic State.\n\nAll claims of succession are dubious at best, with ISIS fragmented after the fall of its \u201ccaliphate\u201d and thrown into chaos by the craven demise of its leader. Competing factions may well use Amaq and other ISIS media organs to position themselves for claims of leadership.\n\nMany of the top candidates for Baghdadi\u2019s position will find themselves wondering if they are already in the sights of the United States and its allies. According to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), top Islamic State spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir was killed in a joint operation with the U.S. military shortly after Baghdadi\u2019s death.\n\nAs with al-Qaeda after the death of Osama bin Laden, counterterrorism experts expect ISIS to adapt to the loss of its leader and continue as a diffuse terrorist threat, even though its grandiose ambitions to maintain a \u201ccaliphate\u201d have been rather severely set back.\n\nA crucial difference is that al-Qaeda had already adapted itself to run at a slower, more careful speed before bin Laden\u2019s death. Dissatisfaction with that lower profile and more deliberate amassing of influence was one of the reasons ISIS split from al-Qaeda. Experts disagree about how much of the Islamic State\u2019s appeal was tied into its possession of territory, the tremendous amount of money it looted from captured populations and oil resources, and Baghdadi\u2019s cachet as a uniquely legitimate \u201ccaliph.\u201d\n\nOne interesting hitch for the Islamic State\u2019s effort to transfer leadership is that allied terrorist organizations in other countries pledged personal fealty to Baghdadi in a ritual called bayat, rather than joining ISIS in the manner of a corporate merger. With ISIS already a shadow of its former self, some of those allies might not be eager to transfer their loyalty to a new leader, especially if multiple feuding candidates present themselves for the position.", "description": "Islamic State turns to former Iraqi military officer Abdullah \u201cThe Professor\u201d Qardash for leadership after the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/12/Islamic-State-flag-men-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
