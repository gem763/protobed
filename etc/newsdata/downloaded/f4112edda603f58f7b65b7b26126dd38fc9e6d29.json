About 40 percent of those viewers, or a little under 2.6 million, watched the first day.\n\nSecretly shot over 50 days, \u2018El Camino\u2019 picks up right where the hit cable drama \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 left off six years ago when the season 5 premiere garnered an audience of 5.9 million. The opening day viewership was comparable with most of the show\u2019s run.\n\nThe \"El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie\" cast and crew celebrate the film premiere at Regency Village Theatre on October 07, 2019 in Westwood, California. More\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore surging in its fifth and final season, largely thanks to Netflix, \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 averaged roughly 1.7 million same-day viewers per episode \u2014 ending with an epic 10+ million audience number for the series finale.\n\nHowever, Netflix typically cautions against Nielsen ratings, arguing the data doesn\u2019t provide a full picture as the firm only counts TV viewership and not other devices like a phone or tablet.\n\nAdditionally, Nielsen only measures U.S. audiences, whereas Netflix reports worldwide numbers, as its business model heavily relies on global subscribers.\n\nQuestions linger after strong quarter\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix impressed investors with an earnings beat on Wednesday. Yet some of those figures raised more questions about whether the streaming giant could keep defying gravity.\n\nStruggling subscriber growth and light fourth quarter guidance dampened the platform\u2019s recent successes, just as competitors like Disney (DIS) and Apple (AAPL) prepare for eagerly anticipated November launches.\n\nEarlier this week, Disney Plus unveiled its entire slate of content via Twitter thread. And ahead of Apple TV+\u2019s debut of \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 star Jennifer Aniston made her record-breaking Instagram debut.\n\nGraphic by David Foster/Yahoo Finance More\n\nNetflix responded to the increased competition in a letter to shareholders on Wednesday:\n\n\u201cMany are focused on the \u2018streaming wars,\u2019 but we\u2019ve been competing with streamers (Amazon, YouTube, Hulu) as well as linear TV for over a decade...While the new competitors have some great titles (especially catalog titles), none have the variety, diversity and quality of new original programming that we are producing around the world,\u201d the company said.\n\nNetflix spent roughly $15 billion on creating and licensing content this year \u2014 with that number expected to increase by 20% in 2020.\n\n\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead more:", "description": "Netflix is betting heavily on original content slate, but the streaming wars loom large.", "authors": ["Alexandra Canal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OQGtN.LQVh_sN9t75HtUWA--~B/aD0yNTMzO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/6098e4d0-f1dd-11e9-97fb-25c527f9d0c8", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
