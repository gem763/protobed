CNN Travel asked her to share her bucket list from the book, so she told us where she wants to go next, in her own words.\n\nTokyo, Japan\n\nGardens like this one at Sensoji Temple provide restful place amid the hustle and bustle of busy Tokyo. Shutterstock\n\nTokyo -- and Japan more generally -- might be top of my bucket list, and I'm actually planning a trip there in autumn 2020. Tokyo is at once the home of cutting-edge technologies, glassy skyscrapers, alien robot shows, pulsating nightlife and fresh sushi, serene gardens and Buddhist shrines. There's always something newer, brasher, weirder in Tokyo. I can't wait to go and experience the city for myself. I suspect it's like nowhere else on Earth.\"\n\nYellowstone National Park, United States\n\nA herd of bison gather in the Hayden Valley at Yellowstone National park. JREden/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\n\"Steaming pools of blue edged by green, yellow, orange and brown, thundering waterfalls and spewing geysers -- the classic images of volcanic Yellowstone are enough to catapult it on to most bucket lists! I love wildlife and dramatic landscapes, so Yellowstone has got it all. Seeing grizzly bears, buffalo and horned elk in their natural habitat would be incredible.\"\n\nRelated content National Park adventures: Best parks to get your thrills\n\nGenghis Khan Equestrian Statue, Mongolia\n\nThe world's largest statue of Genghis Khan is in Mongolia. Shutterstock\n\n\"I have a couple of friends who've traveled the Trans-Siberian Railway. I've never done a train journey of that length myself, but I think it's a really atmospheric way to travel -- and it's also better for the environment. One friend stopped to visit the Genghis Khan Equestrian Statue in Mongolia. This is one of the more bizarre spots in the book -- this vast, 44-meter hulk of steel in the middle of the Mongolian steppe. It sparked my imagination because the landmark feels totally incongruous with its surroundings, but is also a testament to how important Genghis Khan still is for the Mongolian people.\"\n\nRelated content Mongolia photos: 18 of its most stunning places\n\nEaster Island\n\nEaster Island is home to these hulking rock statues carved centuries ago. tankbmb/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nEaster Island feels like a totally justified 'once-in-a-lifetime-experience' sort of place to me. It's remote (more than 2,000 kilometers from the nearest inhabited island) with nearly 900 moai statues scattered along the coastline. The thought of these hulks of rock -- carved into human form centuries ago, probably to honor ancestors -- surrounded by nothing but grass and the ocean sounds like such an awesome sight.\"\n\nRelated content The most remote places on Earth\n\nLahaul and Spiti, India\n\nThe famous Chandratal Lake captures the unimaginable beauty of Lahaul and Spiti. Shutterstock\n\n\"Striking, icy and remote, the scenery here is breathtakingly beautiful. Being right next to Tibet, the area's benefited from Tibetan influence, too. I traveled around India for several months about a decade ago, and totally fell in love with the country. I also think there's something enticing about an area that has just become more accessible. Why go skiing with the masses in France or Italy when you could go skiing in virgin Lahaul-Spiti?\"\n\nRelated content India's 30 most beautiful places to visit\n\nSt. Petersburg, Russia\n\nPertergof Palace is home to this large fountain ensemble. Shutterstock\n\n\"St. Petersburg is, in my mind, the classic canal city. It's got 44 islands, beautiful pastel palaces, more than 400 bridges, imposing mansions, churches with colorful onion domes and landscaped gardens and parks. The architecture just sounds unbeatable. I'm also fascinated by the history of the USSR and if you look beyond the palaces, there's Moskovsky district, with Stalinist neoclassical architecture, and fun finds like the interactive Museum of Soviet Arcade Machines.\"\n\nBeirut, Lebanon\n\nTravelers are coming back to Beirut. ramzihachicho/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\n\"Beirut has spent much of its recent history being defined by the troubles in the Middle East -- which in turn impacted tourism here. But in a world where overtourism is becoming more of a problem and where adventurous travelers are seeking out the most interesting places to eat, shop and gallery hop, that just makes Beirut even cooler. I haven't traveled much in the Middle East; it's a region I'd love to explore more. \"\n\nRelated content Why Lebanon is gearing up for a record number of tourists\n\nSaxon Switzerland, Germany\n\nThe sun rises over Bastei rocks and the Bastei Bridge in Saxon Switzerland, Germany. rusm/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\n\"The first time I looked at a picture of Saxon Switzerland (actually in Germany), the pinnacles reminded me of somewhere I'd been in China (the Stone Forest near Kunming). I was surprised to learn that these strange rock formations, surrounded by lush countryside and wooded hills, were actually in Europe. Being London based, I love finding great places to visit close to home. It's just an extra draw that these landscapes featured in Wes Anderson's Grand Budapest Hotel.\"\n\nRelated content Germany's 30 most beautiful places\n\nThe Alhambra, Spain\n\nThe Alhambra Palace and fortress complex glows during sunset in Granada.

The Alhambra is meant to be one of the most impressive examples of Moorish architecture and ornamentation the world over, which is why it makes my bucket list.\"\n\nNamibia\n\nDead remains of an acacia tree provide a stark image at Namib-Naukluft National Park.
