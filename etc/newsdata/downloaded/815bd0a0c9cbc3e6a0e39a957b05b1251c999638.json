We will be asking UEFA to investigate as a matter of urgency.\"\n\nUEFA, meanwhile, announced it would not be making a statement on Monday.", "description": "England's 6-0 hammering of Bulgaria was marred by racist chanting and Nazi salutes", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Pa", "Itvfootball Twitter", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20581067.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bulgaria-v-England-UEFA-Euro-2020-Qualifying-Group-A-Vasil-Levski-National-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
