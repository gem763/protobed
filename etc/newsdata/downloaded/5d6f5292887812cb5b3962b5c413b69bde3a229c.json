There\u2019s a GIF where Will Smith just slides into the kitchen and so we were like \u201chow many people do you think we\u2019ll get a reply from this?\u201d\n\n\u2018I did want to get Arabella to reply, that was the focus.\u2019\n\nArabella, who briefly dated Danny Williams, was severely unimpressed at his gif of choice and left him on read.\n\nWe would have done the same, Arabella.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWes revealed that when the two finally met she had told him: \u2018I did fancy you \u2013 but the way you slid in was absolutely terrible.\u2019\n\nWes and Arabella are slowly becoming goals (Picture: NIGHTVISION / BACKGRID)\n\nMeanwhile, the star recently made a dig at his ex-girlfriend Megan Barton-Hanson.\n\nEarlier in the month, the former Islander made his feelings towards his ex on Instagram.\n\nWhen one fan commented: \u2018Megan punching the wall,\u2019 underneath a photo of him and Arabella, he responded with a load of laughing face emojis.\n\nThings didn\u2019t end too well then?\n\nWes recently impressed fans when he appeared rapping on the celebrity version of X Factor in his group with Zara McDermott, Samira Mighty and Eyal Booker.\n\nHowever, he had a huge issue with the band name, The Islanders.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a touchy subject. I\u2019m not saying \u201cThe Islanders\u201d. I\u2019ll look like a f***ing idiot,\u2019 he told Heat magazine.\n\nYeah, he raps (Picture: Dymond/Thames/Syco/REX)\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not a diva. I still don\u2019t consider myself a celebrity, I hate saying that word. We just want to be known for something other than dating.\u2019\n\nFair enough, Wes.\n\nSo far, he\u2019s got dating, rapping and ice skating on his CV, so he hasn\u2019t got far to go.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
