By contrast Topping\u2019s new report shows that 17% of stop and searches in England and Wales resulted in arrests.\n\nBefore a policing conference at the university this Wednesday, which will be attended by the PSNI\u2019s new chief constable, Simon Byrne, Topping said his force\u2019s continued use of stop and search could provoke a new generation in Northern Ireland into street violence.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn view of the elevated rates of use by the PSNI, the poor outcomes in terms of lack of arrests and evidence that stop and search can destroy police-community relations, what are the police here using that power for?\n\n\u201cIt is time for the PSNI to come into line with the reforms seen across the rest of the UK. Otherwise, we should not be surprised if the lessons of Brixton\u2019s riots in 1981 or London in 2011 play out in the streets of Belfast in some shape or form.\u201d\n\nThe QUB crime expert stressed that the rise in PSNI stop and searches, at a time when they have fallen in other UK constabularies\u2019 areas, could not be solely put down to the continued dissident republican terror threat in Northern Ireland.\n\nTopping pointed out that 80% of non-terrorist stop and searches in the region were carried out under the Misuse of Drugs Act in the region. He said: \u201cThis figure points to an unofficial policy of the targeting of young males in Northern Ireland for low level drug possession.\u201d\n\nSuch a policy was criminalising young males in the region, Topping said.\n\nOn the overall effect of stop and search, he said: \u201cWhether it\u2019s Brixton or the Bogside in Derry, when there are long histories of negative police-community relations, stop and search only serves to reinforce negative stereotypes and perceptions of the police \u2013 especially when it is used at high levels but with little crime effect.\u201d\n\nBut the PSNI said it disputed the survey\u2019s figure of 74% claiming instead that the increase in stop and search was in fact 27% from 2005 to 2015.\n\nDefending the PSNI\u2019s policy of stop and search under the Misuse of Drugs Act, a spokesperson said: \u201cPSNI officers have a power to stop and search individuals where they have reasonable grounds to suspect an offence. Since April 2019, 749 young people were stopped and searched with three-quarter being under misuse of drugs legislation.\n\n\u201cThis is a proactive response to the increase in young people losing their lives whilst under the influence of drugs and a direct response to community concerns. There has been a 58% increase in drug-related deaths in the last 10 years so the PSNI must be proactive in this area in order to keep people safe.\u201d", "description": "There has been a 74% increase in PSNI officers using these powers since 2005, researchers claim", "authors": ["Henry Mcdonald", "Katrina Ffrench"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25124f30a6bfb92f391f31cc123ba6243be4a34d/0_127_3008_1805/master/3008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=37cf4f0e034b898b47f8693ac86b2e79"}
