It follows the same blueprint used by Washington in its attempt to limit the influence of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] for what it says are national security reasons.\n\nU.S. officials said the action was not tied to this week\u2019s resumption of trade talks with China, but it signals no let-up in U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s hard-line stance as the world\u2019s two biggest economies seek to end their 15-month trade war.\n\nThe Commerce Department said in a filing the \u201centities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China\u2019s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Government and Department of Commerce cannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China,\u201d said Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross.\n\nChina\u2019s commerce ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nHikvision, with a market value of about $42 billion, calls itself the world\u2019s largest maker of video surveillance gear.\n\nSenseTime, valued at around $4.5 billion in a May 2018 fundraising, is one of the world\u2019s most valuable AI unicorns while Megvii, backed by e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA.N), is valued at around $4 billion and is preparing an IPO to raise at least $500 million in Hong Kong.\n\nThe other companies on the list are speech recognition firm iFlytek Co (002230.SZ), surveillance equipment maker Zhejiang Dahua Technology (002236.SZ), digital data forensics products maker Xiamen Meiya Pico Information Co (300188.SZ) and Yixin Science and Technology Co.\n\nOVERSEAS REVENUE\n\nA U.S. Hikvision spokesman said the company \u201cstrongly opposes\u201d the decision and noted that in January it retained a human rights expert and former U.S. ambassador to advise the company on human rights compliance.\n\nFILE PHOTO: An ethnic Uighur demonstrator wears a mask as she attends a protest against China in front of the Chinese Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, October 1, 2019. REUTERS/Huseyin Aldemir/File Photo\n\n\u201cPunishing Hikvision, despite these engagements, will deter global companies from communicating with the U.S. government, hurt Hikvision\u2019s U.S. businesses partners and negatively impact the U.S. economy,\u201d the company added.\n\nJohn Honovich, founder of surveillance video research company IPVM, said Hikvision and Dahua both use Intel Corp (INTC.O), Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), Ambarella Inc (AMBA.O), Western Digital (WDC.O) and Seagate Technology (STX.O) as suppliers and that the impact on the Chinese companies would be \u201cdevastating\u201d.\n\nThe blacklisting of Huawei has hurt many of its U.S. suppliers that depended on the world\u2019s largest telecommunications company for revenue and made it difficult for Huawei to sell new products.\n\nReuters reported in August Hikvision receives nearly 30% of its 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) in revenue from overseas.\n\nSenseTime said in a statement it was deeply disappointed by the U.S. move, that it abides by all relevant laws of the jurisdictions in which its operates and that it has been actively developing an AI code of ethics to ensure its technologies are used responsibly.\n\nIFlytek said its placement on the blacklist would not affect its daily operations. \u201cWe have already anticipated this situation and will continue to provide excellent products and services for our customers,\u201d it said.\n\nXiamen Meiya said its overseas revenue was less than 1% of total revenue and that most of its suppliers were domestic companies.\n\nHikvision\u2019s stock was untraded while Xiamen Meiya was down a relatively mild 1.6% in Tuesday trade. Shares in U.S. supplier Ambarella fell 12% in after-hours trading on the news.\n\nChina faces growing condemnation from Western capitals and rights groups for setting up facilities that U.N. experts describe as mass detention centers holding more than 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims.\n\nIn April, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers urged the move against Chinese companies it called \u201ccomplicit in human rights abuses\u201d and specifically cited Hikvision and Dahua.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week at the Vatican that \u201cwhen the state rules absolutely, it demands its citizens worship government, not God. That\u2019s why China has put more than one million Uighur Muslims ... in internment camps and is why it throws Christian pastors in jail.\u201d\n\nIn August, the Trump administration released an interim rule banning federal purchases of telecommunications equipment from five Chinese companies, including Huawei and Hikvision.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe ban was included in the National Defense Authorization Act passed last year, and restricted the use of federal money to purchase telecommunications equipment and services and video surveillance equipment from \u201ccovered\u201d telecommunications companies, citing national security concerns.\n\nHuawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services and has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government\u2019s restrictions.\n\n(Corrects paragraph 19 to show Hikvision shares were untraded)", "description": "The U.S. government expanded its trade blacklist to include some of China's top artificial intelligence startups, punishing Beijing for its treatment of Muslim minorities and ratcheting up tensions ahead of high-level trade talks in Washington this week.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438317698&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF97032", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
