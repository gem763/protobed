REUTERS/Staff/File Photo\n\nStock markets in Asia cheered U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s outlining the first phase of an agreement to end a trade war with China and suspending a threatened tariff hike, but European shares slipped.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.75% in early trade in London.\n\nGermany's DAX .GDAXI, dominated by companies exposed to China, slipped 0.5%. All European country indexes were in the red.\n\nMSCI\u2019s All-Country World Index, which tracks shares across 47 countries, was down 0.06% on the day.\n\nThe emerging trade deal, covering agriculture, currency and some aspects of intellectual-property protection, would represent the biggest step by the two countries in 15 months. But investors advised caution.\n\n\u201cWhile a positive development, we are not absolutely certain that this marks the start of a clear de-escalation of the trade dispute,\u201d said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. A number of issues were unresolved or unclear, in his view.\n\n\u201cA delay to the scheduled December tariffs was not announced, although that\u2019s likely if a deal is reached, and the state of provisions on intellectual property, forced technology transfer, and Chinese state subsidies, the most difficult aspects of the negotiations, are still unclear.\u201d\n\nContributing to the gingerly reception of phase 1 of the trade agreement were data showing a further contraction of Chinese exports and imports in September. Liquidity was also lacking with Japan off and a partial market holiday in the United States for Columbus Day.\n\nAustralia's main index gained 0.54% and South Korea .KS11 rose 1.11%. Shanghai blue chips .CSI300 added 1%.\n\nE-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were down 0.2% after rising on Friday.\n\nThe drag from the trade war was a major reason Singapore\u2019s central bank eased monetary policy on Monday for the first time in three years. Data showed the city-state\u2019s economy had only narrowly dodged recession.\n\nBIG WEEK FOR BREXIT\n\nThe progress on trade was still enough to hit safe-haven bonds. Yields on U.S. 10-year Treasury notes rose to 1.7530%.\n\nThe yield curve also steepened as short-term rates were held down by news the Federal Reserve would start buying about $60 billion per month in Treasury bills to ensure \u201cample reserves\u201d in the banking system.\n\nThe fading rally in risk assets as European markets opened saw the Japanese yen regain ground against the dollar. The currency was 0.2% higher to the dollar at 108.22 JPY=.\n\nThe dollar gained 0.2% against a basket of currencies.\n\nSterling fell to $1.2556 GBP=, retreating from a 15-week high of $1.2708 on Friday on optimism Britain could reach a deal on Brexit with the European Union. However, both British and EU officials said on Sunday more work would be needed to secure an agreement.\n\nMore talks will be held on Monday before a summit of EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday and Friday.\n\nSpot gold gained 0.05%, last trading at $1,490.20 per ounce.\n\nOil prices pared gains made on Friday after reports that an Iranian state-owned oil tanker had been attacked in the Red Sea.\n\nInvestors were also watching Turkey\u2019s incursion into Syria as the White House threatened to impose sanctions on Ankara.\n\nBrent crude futures eased 1.14% to $59.82 a barrel. U.S. crude lost 1.04% to $54.13 a barrel.", "description": "A global index of stock markets slipped on Monday as signs of progress in the China-U.S. trade dispute drew mixed a reaction from investors, with some cautioning over a lack of detail in the initial stages of the agreement.", "authors": ["Ritvik Carvalho", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440654550&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0NH", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
