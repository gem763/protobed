The Nationals lead Houston 2-0.\n\n___\n\n5:41 p.m.\n\nJuan Soto got a sweet treat for turning 21 \u2014 a birthday cake on the field from David Ortiz and Alex Rodriguez.\n\nSoto hoped to put the icing on that cake, too, because his 21st came on the same day as Game 3 of the World Series.\n\nSoto starred for the Nationals in helping them take a 2-0 lead over Houston. The breakout star of this postseason is 4 for 7 with two doubles and a home run against the Astros.\n\nOrtiz and Rodriguez are working on the Fox broadcast.
