The anonymous government official whose complaint has touched off the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump is part of a long tradition of whistleblowers in the U.S. The person has been linked to such figures of the past as Ellsberg, who spilled the secret Defense Department study known as the Pentagon Papers nearly 50 years ago. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Erin Brockovich, who has some experience in revealing disturbing secrets, knows what she would say to the government whistleblower at the heart of allegations that President Donald Trump pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival Joe Biden.\n\n\"I would say, 'You are obviously a person of integrity and you take it seriously when you hear about wrongdoing,'\" Brockovich, the environmental and consumer activist, said in a recent telephone interview. \"The name 'whistleblower' gets a bad connotation, and I've never understood that.\"\n\nAs Democrats move to begin impeachment hearings and Trump tweets accusations of treason, the headlines turn on a government official's written complaint about the president \"using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\"\n\nLabeled #FakeWhistleBlower by Trump, the official remains unknown to the public but has already been linked to such whistleblowers of the past as Brockovich, Daniel Ellsberg and Edward Snowden.\n\nPresidents, military leaders and corporate executives have raged against them, but whistleblowers have been around as long as the country itself.\n\nThe world's first whistleblower protection legislation is widely considered to have been passed in the U.S., in 1778, and whistleblowers have since helped advance or break scandals ranging from Enron to lies about the Vietnam War. Whistleblowers have inspired movies (\"Erin Brockovich,\" ''Silkwood,\" ''Serpico\") and countless books, most recently Snowden's best-selling memoir, \"Permanent Record.\"\n\n\"Whistleblowing is as American as apple pie,\" says author Allison Stanger, whose \"Whistleblowers: Honesty in America from Washington to Trump\" came out last week.\n\nWhistleblowers have a long, diverse and complicated history, right down to the definition and spelling of the word. It dates back at least to the 19th century, when a police officer trying to warn citizens about a riot was referred to as a \"whistle blower.\"\n\nIn the 20th century, \"whistle blowers\" became \"whistle-blowers\" and were at times associated with sports referees or with \"snitches\" or \"rats\" who violated a code of silence.\n\nThe expression was rebranded in the 1970s by consumer advocate Ralph Nader and moved closer to its current understanding of someone who calls out corporate or government wrongdoing. \"Whistleblower\" is now one word, generally unhyphenated, and defined by activists as someone who exposes wrongdoing, often from the inside at personal risk.\n\n\"It isn't surprising to me that the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower is from the intelligence community,\" says Danielle Brian, executive director of the watchdog Project on Government Oversight. \"Whistleblowers don't plan to become whistleblowers. People think of whistleblowers as some kind of anarchist, but they tend to be more conservative than we realize and to see the world in terms of right and wrong.\"\n\nWhistleblowing may begin with a moment of conscience, but there is no single path to action, no single kind of crime exposed or agreed-upon canon of whistleblowers. The Trump-Ukraine official worked within established government channels, but others have openly broken laws.\n\nEllsberg has said he expected to spend the rest of his life in prison after leaking the Pentagon Papers, a Defense Department study of the government's involvement in Vietnam that he helped prepare (Charges against him of violating the Espionage Act were thrown out after it was learned that the Nixon administration had burglarized his psychiatrist's office.)\n\nSnowden, a former intelligence contractor who now lives in Russia, leaked files on massive government surveillance and would almost surely face prosecution if he returned to the U.S.\n\nWhistleblowers have revealed financial fraud at Enron, excessive costs of military weapons systems, and the tampering with tobacco at Brown & Williamson, a scandal from the 1990s that inspired the movie \"The Insider.\"\n\nLouis Clark, who heads the nonprofit Government Accountability Project, cites Robert MacLean, the federal air marshal who in 2003, just two years after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, disclosed government plans to cut costs by removing air marshals from all overnight long-distance flights.\n\n\"Very soon after he went public, they reversed that decision,\" Clark says.", "description": "Erin Brockovich, who has some experience in revealing disturbing secrets, knows what she would say to the government whistleblower at the heart of allegations that President Donald Trump pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political rival Joe Biden.
