Kamala Harris (D-CA) didn\u2019t wait to be asked. In the midst of yet another discussion of whether Medicare-for-all would raise taxes on the middle class, Harris changed the subject.\n\n\u201cThis is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle,\u201d she said, counting the two-night events in June and July. But amid \u201call of these discussions about health care,\u201d the senator went on, there\u2019s been barely a word \u201con women\u2019s access to health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous,\u201d Harris continued. \u201cThere are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive health care. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say women will die because these Republican legislatures in these various states, who are out of touch with America, are telling women what to do with their bodies.\u201d\n\nHarris could have been talking about the near-total abortion bans that have passed in Ohio, where the debate was held, as well as Alabama, Georgia, and elsewhere in the past year. Or she could have been talking about more subtle restrictions on abortion clinics that, if upheld by the Supreme Court, could have the same effect. Whatever the case, Harris was the first person on Tuesday night to bring up a crucial aspect of the health care debate that\u2019s been largely ignored on the debate stage: Americans\u2019 access to reproductive health care, including abortion.\n\nAbortion has been ignored at previous debates. Harris put a stop to that.\n\nBack in 2016, reproductive justice activist Renee Bracey Sherman started the hashtag #AskAboutAbortion because the issue wasn\u2019t getting enough attention in debates at the time.\n\nThree years and one presidential election cycle later, the issue still isn\u2019t getting much airtime on the stage. Reproductive rights did get a substantive discussion in a debate in June, when Gov. Jay Inslee and Sen. Amy Klobuchar sparred over who had done more to expand access. But at subsequent debates, the issue got less and less attention, and in the third debate in September, reproductive rights weren\u2019t mentioned at all. After the debate, Harris voiced her displeasure, tweeting that the debate \u201cwas three hours long and not one question about abortion or reproductive rights.\u201d\n\nThe #DemDebate was three hours long and not one question about abortion or reproductive rights. \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 13, 2019\n\nIn the runup to the fourth debate on Tuesday, activists used the #AskAboutAbortion hashtag again to press moderators on the issue. Meanwhile, Katie McDonough at Jezebel noted that \u201cthe candidates don\u2019t actually need to be asked a question about abortion in order to talk about abortion. They can just talk about it.\u201d\n\nHarris may have taken such messages to heart. As the senator\u2019s comment implied, reproductive health care is inextricable from the health care debate. About 1 in 4 women will get an abortion by the age of 45, according to the Guttmacher Institute. When people seek an abortion but can\u2019t get one \u2014 something advocates say will happen more and more if state restrictions are allowed to go into effect \u2014 they face elevated risks of health problems and are more likely to stay in abusive relationships. And abortion rights are part of a larger spectrum of reproductive justice issues, including access to contraceptive, fertility, and prenatal care \u2014 all of which have received short shrift at the debates as well.\n\nMany Democratic candidates have robust policy plans around reproductive health \u2014 Harris, for example, wants to use a system modeled on the Voting Rights Act to limit state-level abortion restrictions. But you wouldn\u2019t know that based on the debates so far.\n\nAfter Harris\u2019s comments Tuesday night, Sen. Cory Booker followed up by saying that \u201cwomen should not be the only ones taking up this cause\u201d and that \u201cpeople deserve to control their own bodies.\u201d\n\nAnd the moderators did eventually ask a question about how the candidates would stop states from restricting reproductive rights. Again, Booker was a standout, noting that such restrictions have the biggest impact on people in poverty.\n\nBut Harris was first out of the gate Tuesday on an issue that\u2019s been largely ignored in recent debates, despite how important it is to many voters. She wasn\u2019t asked about abortion rights, but she made clear that she has an answer.", "description": "Reproductive rights finally got a moment after being ignored at previous debates.", "authors": ["Anna North", "Peter Kafka", "Alex Ward", "German Lopez", "Emily Todd Vanderwerff", "Emily Stewart", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BDlZJnm8fWUjWs8EHJnTdqsnHIo=/0x0:3994x2091/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19291195/GettyImages_1176119151.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
