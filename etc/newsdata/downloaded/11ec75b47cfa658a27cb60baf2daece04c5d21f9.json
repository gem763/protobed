Hamilton to put the policy on hold while legal challenges are resolved. The policy is set to go into effect on Oct. 15.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump officials move to deny green cards, path to citizenship for poor immigrants\n\nThe new rule \u2014 which critics say makes the definition of \u201cpublic charge\u201d so vague and all-encompassing that it will effectively favor only rich, white immigrants \u2014 drew swift rebuke from dozens of state and local governments, attorneys general, public health organizations and immigrant advocacy groups after U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services formally announced the policy in September.\n\n\u201cWe know that disproportionately it will impact people coming from nonwhite nations,\u201d said Max Wolson, a staff attorney for the National Immigration Law Center and one of the attorneys on the first case. \u201cThe other insidious portion of this is that we know it will chill people. The rule is so complicated and so confused that it will result in millions of people not accessing benefits to which they\u2019re entitled.\u201d\n\nA USCIS spokesperson said the agency generally does not comment on pending litigation. In its response to the case under consideration in Oakland, the government said that its new criteria are consistent with the plain meaning of \u201cpublic charge\u201d and that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that severe harm would result from the public-charge rule.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHamilton asked plaintiffs to provide further documentation of the harm they expect to result from the policy and expressed concern with the increasingly common use of seeking preliminary injunctions to halt the implementation of nationwide policies, Wolson said. Attorneys have routinely requested the help of federal judges to temporarily halt the implementation of Trump administration policies while they are litigated in court, a process that can take months or years.\n\nHamilton asked the legal challengers and USCIS to consider the possibility of a preliminary injunction that would not be applicable nationwide. She is expected to decide next week on whether to block the rule from taking effect.\n\nA federal judge in Olympia, Wash., on Thursday is set to hold a separate hearing on that question, in response to another lawsuit filed by a coalition of 13 states. Federal judges in New York, Maryland and Illinois also are scheduled to hear cases contesting the public-charge rule.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe policy, which pertains to people who immigrate legally, is part of a policy-level effort to limit who is allowed to come to the United States and who can stay. The Trump administration has sought those limits by expanding bureaucratic hurdles to obtaining visas, tightening the conditions for asylum, cutting refu\u00adgee admissions, banning the nationals of certain majority-Muslim countries, expanding immigration enforcement raids and deportations, and forcing asylum seekers who come across the U.S.-Mexico border to wait in Mexico until their court hearings.\n\nUnder the new public-charge rule, immigrants who are in the United States legally and use public benefits such as Medicaid, food stamps or housing assistance \u2014 or have at one time used public benefits, or are deemed likely to someday use public benefits \u2014 could be considered \u201cpublic charges,\u201d rendering them ineligible for green cards.\n\nThe new criteria provide \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d factors for immigration officials to weigh as they decide on green-card applications. Negative factors include whether a person is unemployed, dropped out of high school or is not fluent in English.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCritics say the rule is likely to reduce legal immigration by slashing eligibility for family-based visas, the leading type of legal immigration to the United States, particularly from low-income countries in Africa and Latin America. They say it could also lead to more deportations as huge numbers of immigrants see their applications denied.\n\nFor as long as the term has existed in U.S. law, critics say, \u201cpublic charge\u201d has been defined as someone who relies on government assistance for more than half their cash income.\n\nThe lawsuits argue that the new \u201cpublic charge\u201d definition deviates substantially from more than 100 years of legal interpretation. They say it will cause significant harm to the health and well-being of immigrant families, as well as the institutions that service them, by leading many to abstain from seeking public benefits that they or their children may need.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe lawsuits also contend that acting USCIS director Ken Cuccinelli \u2014 who presided over the implementation of the new policy \u2014 does not have the legal authority to hold his position. They also argue that the administration failed to follow the required decision-making procedures, in announcing the policy with little consideration of the more than 200,000 public comments it received as feedback. And they allege that the administration is in violation of the Constitution for imposing a policy with the intent to discriminate.\n\nThe government argues in court papers that Cuccinelli\u2019s appointment to his position has no bearing on the rule\u2019s validity.\n\nAnother case, on behalf of two college students who came to the United States as children, charges that the administration violated the due-process clause of the Fifth Amendment, because the policy is so broad and does not give immigrants \u201cfair notice\u201d of what actions would make them public charges in the eyes of the government.\n\nCASA de Maryland, one of the parties in the case, said the immigrants it serves \u201chave stopped accepting or have refused to apply for public benefits for themselves and their family members, including their children, because of fear that receiving any benefits will harm their ability to stay in the United States.\u201d\n\nAlice Crites contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "An array of state attorneys general, public health organizations and immigrant groups says the policy is discriminatory and illegal.", "authors": ["Abigail Hauslohner", "National Reporter Focusing On Immigrant Communities In America"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DkrVpwnJBt60tuQI3nQlm_fwNEw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CCH2WSXBHYI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg"}
