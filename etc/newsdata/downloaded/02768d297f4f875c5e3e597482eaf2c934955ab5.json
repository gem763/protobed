Succession\u2018s theme song gets a rap remix courtesy of Pusha-T \u2014 and it\u2019s better than the rap we\u2019ve seen performed on the show, thankfully. Michael Kiwanuka, of \u201cCold Little Heart\u201d fame, follows up his Big Little Lies hit with a similarly folksy new song. And Bishop Briggs continues in her lane of bold anthemic pop.\n\n\u201cLights Up,\u201d Harry Styles\n\nIf Harry Styles fans were expecting his second album to be another collection of 70s-leaning rock \u2018n\u2019 roll tunes, they were in for a surprise this week when the elusive star dropped his first new song in two years, \u201cLights Up.\u201d His first single last time, \u201cSign of the Times,\u201d was a boldly mesmerizing ballad with disco tendencies. \u201cLights Up\u201d is something different entirely, veering from moody, glittering pop to smooth piano-driven R&B. There\u2019s a background choir and unhurried percussion underlying the whole thing, but it feels insistent. \u201cAll the lights couldn\u2019t put out the dark runnin\u2019 through my heart,\u201d Styles sings, and although the echoing hums are uplifting, the lyrics suggest a sadder edge. It\u2019s hard to say what direction Styles will go in next \u2014 he\u2019s proved himself as a versatile artist \u2014 and \u201cLights Up\u201d only indicates that he\u2019s not afraid of experimenting.\n\n\u201cPuppets (Succession Remix),\u201d Pusha-T and Nicholas Britell\n\nIt was inevitable: the theme song from Succession that\u2019s spawned its own universe of adoring responses got an official rap remix. And it lives up to the source material. Composer Nicholas Britell\u2019s brilliant score, which mashes up choppy piano and orchestral arrangements with a hip-hop beat, gets an added boost from rapper Pusha T\u2019s uncomplicated, well-articulated verses. He sticks to the show\u2019s themes \u2014 privilege, family, power \u2014 and artfully adds his own punches. \u201cIt\u2019s a power struggle, it\u2019s a tug-of-war / That\u2019s amongst the kids, and it ain\u2019t fair,\u201d he raps; it\u2019s an apt description of the show\u2019s storyline, to be sure, but it\u2019s also an indictment. Succession often swings from comedy to tragedy, but Pusha\u2019s remix adds gravitas.\n\n\u201cHero,\u201d Michael Kiwanuka\n\nMichael Kiwanuka has been around for a few years now putting out rootsy, acoustic-anchored music. But he became a name to know when his song \u201cCold Little Heart\u201d was turned into the memorable theme music of the Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman show Big Little Lies. On his third album Kiwanuka, the British artist has plenty more to share in that vein. \u201cHero,\u201d off the upcoming project, hones in on his combination of gritty electric guitar with soulful singing and a soaring bridge.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

It strikes straight through ambient sound, over melodies, and deep into your senses. On \u201cTwo Hands,\u201d the title track off of the alt-rock Brooklyn band\u2019s latest album \u2014 an impressive second project out in one year \u2014 she\u2019s a guiding light over her male bandmates\u2019 lilting playing. \u201cYou somehow let me down,\u201d she sings off the top, but it\u2019s not an admonishment; it\u2019s just a fact, a recitation of reality, that she\u2019s willing to reflect with clear-eyed awareness. The song\u2019s simplicity belies its depth. \u201cSomehow we exist / In the folds, and now we\u2019ll kiss,\u201d she says. The \u201csomehow\u201d cuts to the core.\n\n\u201cJekyll & Hide,\u201d Bishop Briggs\n\nBishop Briggs has one of those malleable, powerful voices that seems almost acrobatic in scope. On \u201cJekyll & Hide\u201d she plays with its range to captivating effect over electronic production and a heavy bass. The new track is off her upcoming sophomore album, which promises to be a collection of anthemic, vocal-forward songs exploring major life moments. That\u2019s what the unapologetic Briggs is best suited for: making the mundane feel big and meaningful. \u201cHave I had enough?\u201d she wonders on \u201cJekyll & Hide,\u201d but the answer is clear: not at all.\n\nWrite to Raisa Bruner at raisa.bruner@time.com.", "description": "New music from Harry Styles, Big Thief, Michael Kiwanuka, Pusha-T and Bishop Briggs.
