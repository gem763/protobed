The social media giant has done the crypto industry few favors as all eyes are now on stablecoins and the outlook for them is predictably pessimistic. Bitcoin, however, has not been deemed a threat just yet.\n\nBig List Of Crypto Concerns\n\nThe G7 group taskforce that issued the draft report yesterday includes senior officials from central banks, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates rules for the G20 countries.\n\nIt focuses on Libra as the big bad wolf and outlines major threats that it considers applicable to all stablecoins. In a section titled \u2018ensuring resilience in the face of new risks\u2019, the report also acknowledged that the global economy is facing uncertainty with declining interest rates, escalating public debt, and weakening financial markets.\n\nTo address these \u2018new risks\u2019 it added that the FSB is developing a new surveillance framework, to be put in place by next year. The number of challenges it considered a threat to financial stability included consumer and investor protection, data privacy and protection, financial integrity including AML/KYC compliance, and fair competition and anti-trust policies.\n\nBasically, all of the things that Facebook cannot provide.\n\nThe list went on citing mitigation of tax evasion, market integrity, sound and efficient governance, cyber security and operational risks, and an appropriate legal basis as issues with Libra-like crypto stablecoins.\n\nThe regulatory body will submit an official issues note on global stablecoins to this week\u2019s G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting.\n\nNo Threat From Bitcoin\n\nNotably, the report went on to add that it did not consider crypto assets such as Bitcoin a threat.\n\n\u201cG20 leaders noted that crypto-assets do not pose a threat to global financial stability at this point, but that they remain vigilant to existing and emerging risks.\u201d\n\nBefore adding \u2018global stablecoins\u2019 could pose a host of challenges to the regulatory community, clearly referring to Libra.\n\nIt acknowledged the benefits of stablecoins for cross border transactions but the likelihood is that most central banks will want to use, control, and profit from their own one and not something dreamt up by a social media monopoly.\n\nAccording to the BBC, a separate report suggests that Libra may not get regulatory approval even if it can address their long list of concerns.\n\n\u201cAddressing such risks is not necessarily a guarantee of regulatory approval for a stablecoin arrangement,\u201d\n\nAs Libra Association members jump ship in droves, Facebook\u2019s grand aspirations of global financial domination appear to be going up in smoke. The consortium will hold its first board meeting in Geneva today, but many of the seats around that table will be empty.\n\nImage from Shutterstock", "description": "It comes as no surprise that Facebook is still on the receiving end of regulatory pressure from global economies.
