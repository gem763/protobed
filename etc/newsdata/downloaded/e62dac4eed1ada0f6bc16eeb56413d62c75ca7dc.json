In classic Eurocrat fashion, he asked to remain anonymous because he earns his living in a real Commission department and fears that colleagues may no longer invite him to meetings in case he makes fun of them.\n\n\"We want to present the European institutions with a different way of communicating that reaches people ... and have them talk about European politics,\" said the man in his mid-thirties, who started the account in June last year.\n\nDG MEME is operating in a crowded field of satirical social media accounts in the Brussels bubble.\n\nAlthough DG MEME's humor can be gentle, it hasn't shied away from criticizing the hand that feeds it, including warning against an \"apathetic communication strategy\" ahead of the European election in May (it later started its own campaign to encourage voting).\n\n\"We cannot allow people like Marine Le Pen to dominate with their style of communication,\" the anonymous DG MEME boss said. \"Instead of always replying in a serious way, you have to also reply at an emotional level, make fun of them and show how ridiculous their points are.\"\n\n\"The beauty of sarcasm is that you challenge the reader: Is this serious? What is the point behind? It makes people reflect about things,\" he added.\n\nDG MEME is operating in a crowded field of satirical social media accounts in the Brussels bubble (including Berlaymonster, American EU Dude, Martini Seltzermayr). As its name makes abundantly clear, it mostly uses memes to make its points.\n\nExamples have included von der Leyen's graphic designer-baiting org chart being turned into a dartboard, with darts in the segments for the Romanian, Hungarian and French nominees; using Margaritis Schinas' occasional penchant for non-communication in his old role as chief Commission spokesperson to poke fun at his new job title; running a tweet by Valdis Dombrovskis through the \"BlaBlaMeter\" bullshit detection tool; and, for Valentine's Day, creating an EU version of Cosmopolitan magazine.\n\nHowever, working at DG MEME doesn't only require a sense of humor and Photoshop skills.\n\n\"Fun is a very serious matter,\" said chief Brexit memer Martina, who joined DG MEME earlier this year. \"We have to make sure that the underlying facts are correct. We don't want to spread fake news.\"\n\nMartina may be (half) anonymous now, but that will change when she takes part in the European Public Communication Conference (EuroPCom) on November 7 and 8, where she will be \"memesplaining the potential of satire to senior communicators.\"\n\nThe European Commission's actual communication department has been taking notice.\n\n\u201cWe really like them,\" said Dana Manescu, head of social media at the Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s constructive criticism. A sarcastic approach can help to communicate about EU politics. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s good content, even though we probably couldn\u2019t do the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are welcome to join our social media team,\" she added.", "description": "DG MEME takes a satirical look at EU politics.", "authors": ["Hans Von Der Burchard", "David M.
