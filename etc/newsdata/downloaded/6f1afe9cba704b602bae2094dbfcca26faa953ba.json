Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\n\nWalgreens will shutter nearly 40% of the clinics in its stores as the drugstore chain cuts costs and shifts to other businesses it believes will draw more people through its doors.\n\nThe company said Monday that it will close 150 Walgreens-run clinics by the end of the year, but it will keep open more than 200 that are run in partnership with health care providers.\n\nDrugstore chains like Walgreens started years ago adding small clinics that dole out flu shots and handle relatively minor health issues like sinus infections. But analysts say the chains have struggled to make money off the clinics, which face growing competition from telemedicine services that allow customers to get care through their smartphones.\n\nIn August, Walgreens announced it was closing 200 stores, which represents less than 3% of the company's nearly 9,600 U.S. stores.\n\nForget the delivery truck: Walgreens is delivering aspirin, snacks via drone\n\nChicken Sandwich War: Popeyes announces return date of its chicken sandwich and takes a dig at Chick-fil-A\n\nWalgreens will shutter nearly 40% of the clinics in its stores as the drugstore chain cuts costs and shifts to other businesses it believes will draw more people through its doors.

Puskar, AP)\n\nWalgreens has been focusing more on testing primary care clinics, which offer more extensive care, connected to some of its stores in Kansas City and Houston.\n\nThe chain also is working on partnerships with other companies like the grocer Kroger Co. to improve its food offerings. Walgreens said Monday that it also will open 100 locations for the weight-loss company Jenny Craig at stores nationwide, starting in January.\n\n\u201cJenny Craig at Walgreens will give customers the opportunity to interact face-to-face with Jenny Craig consultants, just as our patients have experienced for over a century with our pharmacists,\u201d said Jim OConor, Walgreens senior vice president, neighborhood health destination, in a statement.\n\nEdward Jones analyst John Boylan said the closing of the clinics is immaterial to the company financially, and he expects the services Walgreens offers at its stores to shift over time.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc. runs more than 18,750 stores internationally. That includes 9,277 in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nIt has been trimming its total as part of a plan to cut costs. Walgreens has been hit by challenges including reimbursement cuts and lower price increases for branded drugs.\n\nDrugstores also face competition in areas outside their pharmacies from online options like Amazon.com.\n\nWalgreens said Monday that it has raised its annual savings target from its cost cutting program to $1.8 billion by fiscal 2022, up from a previous goal to exceed $1.5 billion.\n\nIn the final quarter of fiscal 2019, Walgreens earnings tumbled 55% to $677 million, due in part to charges from its cost-cutting program. Adjusted results totaled $1.43 per share.\n\nRevenue climbed 1.5% to $33.95 billion.\n\nThe results surpassed Wall Street expectations. Analysts expected, on average, earnings of $1.41 per share on $33.86 billion in revenue, according to Zacks Investment Research.\n\nBoylan termed the quarter good but not great. He said in a research note that Walgreens sales turned out better than expected, and that should continue.\n\nThe analyst said he expects Walgreens to grow its business as health plans narrow the network of pharmacies they cover in exchange for a break on pharmacy costs.\n\nShares of Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreens slipped 12 cents to $55.30 in Monday afternoon trading.\n\nThe stock had dropped 19% since the beginning of the year as of Friday's close. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average, of which Walgreens is a component, has climbed nearly 16%.\n\nContributing: Kelly Tyko, USA TODAY\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/28/walgreens-closing-some-clinics-and-partner-jenny-craig/2489650001/", "description": "Walgreens will shutter nearly 40% of the clinics in its stores, but announced it will open 100 Jenny Craig locations in its stores.", "authors": ["Tom Murphy", "Associated Press", "Published P.M.
