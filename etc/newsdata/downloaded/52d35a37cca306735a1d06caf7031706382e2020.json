She expressed regret at paying $15,000 to inflate her daughter\u2019s SAT test score, saying it was to her \u201ceternal shame\u201d that she did not pull out of the scheme.\n\nShe was sentenced to 14 days in prison, as well as a fine $30,000 fine, supervised release for a year and 250 hours of community service.\n\nLike many, Mr Jeffries and Navratilova questioned the sentence by comparing it to Crystal Mason, an African-American woman given a five-year sentence for voting while on supervised release from prison.\n\nNavratilova tweeted: She tweeted: \u201cIs there anyone that can still argue there is no such thing as WHITE PRIVILEGE?!?\u201d\n\nMs Mason, who is fighting her conviction, also commented, saying in a statement: \u201cI don\u2019t wish this for anyone, but a sentence to 14 days for actual serious fraud just shows how unfair my sentence is.\u201d\n\nMs Huffman will spend her two weeks in jail at Federal Correctional Institution Dublin in California, one of four low-security prisons with an all-female population.\n\nInmates are reportedly allowed up to $320 a month to spend at the prison commissary, which offers ice cream, instant coffee and cookies.", "description": "Actress Felicity Huffman has been accused of benefiting from \u201cwhite privilege\u201d after getting just a two-week jail sentence over paying to inflate her daughter\u2019s exam results.\u00a0 US congressman Hakeem Jeffries, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, and Martina Navratilova, the tennis player, were among", "authors": ["Ben Riley-Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yYGvusYBGPiNxWssJQX8BA--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/cb37e47bae9d69df7b6f89260c8c7743", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
