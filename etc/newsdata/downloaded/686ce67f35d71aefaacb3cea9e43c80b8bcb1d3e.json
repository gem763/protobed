The Sheriff's Office only said that he was placed on medical leave. The office filed a report of misdemeanor battery with the district attorney's office.\n\nAn effort to contact a spokesman for the Sheriff's Office on Tuesday was unsuccessful. Messages to the Deputy Sheriffs' Association of Alameda County seeking comment from the deputy weren't immediately returned.\n\nUjiri attorney Robert Beles said his client is gratified and said the DA's office conducted a thorough investigation.\n\n\"It was definitely the right conclusion,\" he said, calling Ujiri \"a decent human being and a good man.\"", "description": "California prosecutors announced Tuesday that they won't charge Toronto Raptors President Masai Ujiri for shoving a sheriff's deputy after the NBA championship-winning game in Oakland last June.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/NBA-Masai-Ujiri3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
