Yet the mechanism by which that prohibition was enforced remains on the books: a requirement that all would-be newlyweds identify by race. To fill out the form falsely is a felony.\n\nSo, weeks away from their planned Oct. 19 wedding at a barn in Fincastle, Va., the couple is challenging the law in Virginia federal court. Joined by two other engaged couples, they argue the law is a racist holdover that has no place in modern marriage.\n\nThe suit is part of both efforts to scrape away vestiges of segregation in Virginia and to move away from institutional categorization in both race and gender. The plaintiffs say people should be free in their personal lives to identify by race but shouldn\u2019t be forced to, under the First, 13th and 14th amendments. But the lawsuit raises a more challenging question: Can the government address discrimination without labels created from it?\n\n[The white supremacist got hit by a car. His victims celebrated.]\n\n\u201cI am not proposing we stop talking about race altogether,\u201d Rogers, 22, said. \u201cNot only does this type of law not promote or further this important conversation, it doesn\u2019t seek to.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen Samuel Sarfo and Ashley Ramkishun applied for a marriage license in Virginia, they were told they would have to choose \u201cother\u201d if they didn\u2019t identify a race. (Claudia Borges/Claudia Borges Studios LLC)\n\nIn a letter, their attorney, Victor Glasberg, asked Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam to \u201cget on the right side of history\u201d and decline to defend \u201ctainted categories reflecting Virginia\u2019s historical repression of non-white persons.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople for the governor and attorney general did not have an immediate comment.\n\nRogers heard about the plans to challenge the law from a professor at Washington & Lee University, where she\u2019s in her second year of law school and where Churchill, 27, got his undergraduate degree. The school has been confronting its own Confederate past, in a state where both Northam and the attorney general have recently admitted dressing up in blackface.\n\nAs people of European descent \u2014 white, or \u201cpeach-pink,\u201d per the lawsuit \u2014 Rogers and Churchill felt this was a small way to contribute to that reckoning.\n\n\u201cA lot of these issues are structural. They\u2019re complicated,\u201d Churchill said. \u201cThe history of the law is deeply offensive as are the categories. This is an example of a reform we could have an impact on and move the ball forward a little bit.\u201d\n\nIn Arlington, where plaintiffs Ashley Ramkishun and Samuel Sarfo tried to apply for a marriage license, a clerk told them if they didn\u2019t want to identify by race they would have to choose \u201cother.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I have to put down my race, most of the time I\u2019m kind of forced to stick myself in a box I don\u2019t necessarily fit in. . . . I\u2019m not Asian, I\u2019m not American Indian, I\u2019m not black, I\u2019m not white,\u201d said Ramkishun, 26, who is of Asian Indian and Guyanese descent. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to put \u2018other\u2019 because we\u2019re not \u2018other. \u2019 We are human beings.\u201d\n\nSarfo, 32, is from Ghana and likewise avoids racial categorization, saying, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t capture anything for me.\u201d\n\nForms for marriage licenses in Virginia vary by county, but most offer about five options, generally echoing federal guidelines used by the U.S. Census Bureau: white, black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Many offer choices of \u201cother\u201d or \u201cmixed.\u201d\n\n[He helped make legal history in Loving v. Virginia. At 80, he\u2019s still fighting for justice.]\n\nThe lawsuit quotes the judge who cited racial categories when he banished the Lovings from the state. The Virginia couple, a white man and a black woman, ultimately successfully challenged the ban on interracial marriage in the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cAlmighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and placed them on separate continents,\u201d the judge wrote in 1966. \u201cThe fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.\u201d\n\n\u201cVital statistics\u201d are still listed on the state website, where all marriages are sorted into white,\u201d \u201cblack,\u201d \u201cother\u201d and unknown.\n\nSimilar racial requirements for marriage licenses are enshrined in code by only a handful of other states, although in many more states, county forms demand a racial identity without any law to back up the query.\n\nGlasberg, who moved to Virginia to work with one of the attorneys for the Lovings and tried unsuccessfully on his 1981 marriage license to label himself \u201chuman,\u201d has wanted to challenge the law for years.\n\n\u201cThe requirement to identify by \u2018race\u2019 uses terms grounded in ignorance and bigotry, not in science,\u201d he writes in the complaint filed in federal court in Alexandria. \u201cWe are free to define ourselves as we wish.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court has struck down laws discriminating based on race, but not racial categories as themselves unconstitutional, and Glasberg believes he is the first to challenge the collection of racial data on marriage licenses.\n\nIn the suit, he sketches the shameful history of that requirement.\n\nVirginia passed the Racial Integrity Act in 1924. On a birth certificate or marriage licenses, each person was identified as \u201cwhite\u201d or \u201ccolored,\u201d and the act said the two should never mix. Support for the law was driven by Walter Plecker, registrar of the state\u2019s Bureau of Vital Statistics and an indefatigable racist. After prodding the law\u2019s passage, Plecker took it upon himself to investigate \u201cwhite\u201d marriages he deemed suspicious and threatened midwives and new mothers with marital data. In a 1943 letter bragging of the thoroughness of his records he told a federal official, \u201cHitler\u2019s genealogical study of the Jews is not more complete.\u201d\n\nUnder Virginia\u2019s law, people with one-sixteenth or less Native American blood were allowed to call themselves \u201cwhite\u201d \u2014 a concession to the legacy of John Rolfe and Pocahontas that infuriated Plecker. He claimed there were no true American Indians left in Virginia and all were \u201ccolored,\u201d a decree that impedes tribal recognition to this day.\n\n[How a long-dead white supremacist still threatens Virginia\u2019s Indian tribes]\n\nThe suit cites former Census Bureau director Kenneth Prewitt, who argues that our racial categorization needs to evolve.\n\n\u201cI want to stop discrimination, but I don\u2019t want to do it with categories that are not really nuanced enough,\u201d said Prewitt. \u201cI wish we could get past the five races. It\u2019s inchoate; it doesn\u2019t really capture the complexity of our democracy at all.\u201d\n\nKevin Maillard, a law professor at Syracuse University who has studied interracial marriage, said that while researchers might use the data, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the compelling reason that the state would have in retaining tracking of those categories would be.\u201d\n\nBut he was skeptical of an effort to move away from race altogether.\n\n\u201cI think with the deep history of racial strife we have in the United States, these categories are going to remain incredibly important,\u201d Maillard said. \u201cMy mother is racially mixed, but she considers herself a black person.\u201d\n\nCivil rights groups rely on government data to investigate inequality in schools and the criminal justice system and challenge voting restrictions.\n\n\u201cWe need data on who people are to see if there are patterns,\u201d said Myrna P\u00e9rez of the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nGlasberg argues that \u201cwhile it is imperative to be aware of \u2018race\u2019 to extirpate racism, it is unnecessary to continue to racialize groups victimized by racism.\u201d Discrimination laws, he noted, protect groups we don\u2019t consider \u201craces,\u201d including Arabs and Jews.\n\nThe lawsuit\u2019s aims are more modest. But if it drags on past next month, Churchill said he and Rogers \u201cwill have some complicated conversations\u201d about their wedding.\n\nRamkishun and Sarfo are in less of a rush; they\u2019ve been engaged for two years already and aren\u2019t planning a ceremony until sometime next year. They would like to get married in Virginia, where they met working at the Abercrombie & Fitch in the Fashion Centre at Pentagon City. But Sarfo said he doesn\u2019t understand why Virginia doesn\u2019t simply change the law.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re really saying you\u2019ve come that far, why not use common sense?\u201d he said. \u201cJust get rid of the question or make it optional, knowing exactly why it was put on there in the first place.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nFound insane in one killing, D.C. man killed again, police say\n\nHe searched for his brother for 25 years.
