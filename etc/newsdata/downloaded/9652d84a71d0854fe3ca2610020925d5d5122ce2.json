He also said that the government would \"get on and deliver Brexit on October 31st come what may.\" There is currently no Brexit deal in place although lawmakers have already voted to prevent Johnson's government from taking the U.K. out of the bloc without a deal.\n\nSterling jumped nearly 0.40% after the decision to trade at $1.2478.\n\nThe president of the Supreme Court, Brenda Hale, said Johnson's attempt was not a normal suspension and that it had taken place in exceptional circumstances. She said no justification for the government taking such extreme action \u2014 to suspend Parliament for five weeks \u2014 had been put forward.\n\nHale said that the decision by Johnson's government to advise the queen to suspend parliament was unlawful \"because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\"\n\nHale said the judges' decision was unanimous.\n\nAlthough the judges ruled that the suspension is void, it was to lawmakers to decide what to do next. The court said Johnson's lawyer had told the court that the prime minister would comply with the judgment.\n\nJohn Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, welcomed the decision and said Parliament must convene without delay, Reuters reported. Parliament is now expected to reconvene on Wednesday.", "description": "The judges ruled that the suspension of Parliament is void but left it for lawmakers to decide what to do next.", "authors": ["Holly Ellyatt"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106145634-1569320767810gettyimages-1170653099.jpeg?v=1569320800", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
