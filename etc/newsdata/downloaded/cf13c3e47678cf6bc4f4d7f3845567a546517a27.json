Okay\u2014maybe that\u2019s a stretch, but they\u2019re not happy with the liberal tilt the network has taken. It is one of the most prolific and visible anti-Trump networks out there. We all know this, but PV was able to get an insider to speak with CNN employees who confirmed our suspicions about the network. They\u2019re liberal. They hate Trump. And President Jeff Zucker personally intervenes during interviews with members of the Trump administration in the hopes of catching them tripping up live on air. The Trump impeachment circus is front and center, and all of this just adds credence to the chant \u201cCNN sucks.\u201d And if that\u2019s not indicative of how the liberal media has become in the Trump era, PV\u2019s CNN insider, Cary Poarch, caught what they all probably feel about the president during his investigation. Gerald Sisnette, Field Production Supervisor at CNN, said he hoped Trump dies soon (via Project Veritas):\n\nWOW\n\n\n\nNEW FROM @Project_Veritas:\n\nCNN Field Production Supervisor Gerald Sisnette on Trump: \u201cThe Only Way This Will Go Away is When He Dies. Hopefully Soon.\u201d\n\n\n\nUnreal.#ExposeCNN\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/hNbPBIKUgn \u2014 Benny (@bennyjohnson) October 17, 2019\n\nBREAKING: Field Production Supervisor @CNN Gerald Sisnette: \u201cThe Only Way This Will Go Away is When He (Trump) Dies. Hopefully Soon.\u201d#ExposeCNN pic.twitter.com/HxzfP6FOTc \u2014 James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 17, 2019\n\nAccording to CNN insider Cary Poarch, \u201cI want to chase the facts, like the motto that CNN put out earlier this year, \u2018the facts first,\u2019 that\u2019s what I want the news to be. That\u2019s what it should be. That\u2019s what it used to be.\u201d It appears a number of CNN staffers agree: Patrick Davis, Manager of Field Operations at CNN: \u201c\u2026I hate seeing what we were and what we could be and what we\u2019ve become. It\u2019s just awful\u2026I mean, we could be so much better than what we are\u2026And the buck stops with him (Zucker).\u201d [\u2026] Scott Garber, Senior Field Engineer at CNN: \u201cWe used to cover news. We used to go out and do stories\u2026But Trump is more important.\u201d Adia Jacobs, CNN Technical Operations Supervisor: \u201cWhen Zucker took over it wasn\u2019t until Trump that we ended up being all Trump all the time.\u201d Nick Neville, CNN Media Coordinator: \u201cHe (Zucker) basically said f**k all the other stories.\u201d Mike Brevna, Floor Manager at CNN:\u201cIt\u2019s the Trump Network, dog. It\u2019s like everything is all Trump\u2026they not even thinking about anybody else. They sold themselves to the devil.\u201d Gerald Sisnette, Field Production Supervisor at CNN: \u201cThis is a story that\u2019s not gonna go away\u2026The only way this will go away is when he (Trump) dies. Hopefully soon.\u201d\n\nWill the network return to a sense of normalcy? It\u2019s hard to say. Donald Trump has broken the minds of liberal America, maybe irreparably. As for the integrity of the network, that\u2019s long dead. They\u2019ve screwed up so many times in covering this White House. They can\u2019t report him feeding koi fish with the Japanese prime minister accurately, they got played with the \u2018Trump knew about his son\u2019s meeting with the Russians\u2019 story, and they totally flopped on the Wikileaks piece, where they alleged Trump and his inner circle got a decryption key for the trove of emails from John Podesta, then-chair of the Clinton campaign, and the DNC\u2014only to end up correcting the \u2018bombshell\u2019 because the documents were already made public. This key was sent via emailed from a donor. If they merely just looked at the time stamp of the email and when Wikileaks published the DNC emails\u2014this could\u2019ve been avoided. It was simple. They didn\u2019t do it because they\u2019re at full froth in trying to get this president. With every failed attempt, it only reminds Trump voters to turn out next year. It\u2019s an in-kind contribution to the 2020 re-elect. So, thank you. And to that staffer, sorry\u2014Donald Trump isn\u2019t going to die soon. He has one more election to win\u2014and at this point, he will win it handily.", "description": ".10/17/2019 21:01:06PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Alex Nitzberg"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/354/63b3af8d-4413-480e-867d-76bb1e91edfa.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
