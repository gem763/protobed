The index slipped 0.39% on Friday to 2986.20.\n\n\n\nThe NASDAQ dropped 0.83% (or about 67 points) to 8089.54. Shares of Netflix (NASDAQ: ) plunged more than 6% as it appears the honeymoon is over for its initially well-regarded Q3 report.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the numbers for the streaming pioneer, investors are concerned how it will perform in an increasingly competitive landscape after the arrival of services from Apple (NASDAQ: ), Disney and several others.\n\n\n\nThe got the worst of it today with a slide of 0.95% (or more than 255 points) to 26,770.20. But to be fair, most of that deficit stems from a nearly 7% loss at Boeing (NYSE: ) after a story that the airplane giant misled federal authorities on the safety of the 737 Max.\n\n\n\nThe index also got beaten up by a more than 6% plunge from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ), after recalling some baby powder due to traces of asbestos.\n\n\n\nThe Dow came into the session with a slight gain for the week, but finished lower by 0.2%.\n\n\n\nHowever, even with today\u2019s soft session, the S&P rose 0.5% for back-to-back weekly gains, while the NASDAQ now has a three-week winning streak after a rise of 0.4% over the past 5 days.\n\n\n\nThe big story of this week, though, was the stronger-than-expected start to earnings season. Investors were concerned we\u2019d see some cracks in the world\u2019s strongest economy. However, solid reports from several big banks, Netflix and numerous other companies have calmed those skittish investors a bit.\n\n\n\nOf course, it\u2019s early in the season, but another solid week may finally get the S&P past 3,000 and maybe even onto new highs before the year is out. We\u2019ll see a lot of big names report next week, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday an Amazon (NASDAQ: ) on Thursday.\n\n\n\nAnd one more thing. When we get back to work on Monday, there may actually be a Brexit deal! We already know that the U.K. and EU finally hammered out an agreement after three years. What we don\u2019t know is whether or not Parliament will vote for it on Saturday.\n\n\n\nToday's Portfolio Highlights:\n\n\n\nCounterstrike: The 200-day for Alteryx (AYX) has finally been breached, which is exactly what Jeremy was waiting for. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) data analytics software company had been hot all year, but dipped on valuation concerns along with several other software and data names. Now it has slipped into the editor\u2019s target area, so he added AYX on Friday with a 12% allocation. He likes the potential for a relief bounce back into the triple digits after its quarterly report in a couple weeks.

This global healthcare solutions company also adds some diversification to the portfolio. It beat by 42% in its most recent quarter and has an attractive valuation. The editor was most impressed when a big buyer stepped in this morning to halt a decline in the stock, which suggests that there\u2019s support. Brian thinks this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) could see double digits in the near future. The portfolio also sold Immersion (IMMR) for a slight gain.

Dave plans to capitalize on this hot area with a 12.5% allocation in Meritage Homes (MTH), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) designer and builder of single-family homes.
