'They were miracle babies,' Ryne told Today Parents about his children: a boy named Anders and a girl named Linnea.\n\nBut when the babies were nearly one year old, Anders tragically died when a day care provider left him to nap in his car seat.\n\nHappy times: Ryne and Rachel Jungling from North Dakota welcomed twins in January 2018. Pictured is Ryne with his son Anders\n\nLittle miracles: They called the babies, a girl named Linnea (left) and a boy named Anders (right), their 'miracle babies' after having troubles conceiving\n\nHeartbreaking: Rachel dropped off her son Anders (pictured right with his mom) at day care one day in January 2019 in his car seat, and the infant ended up dying while in the center's care\n\nThe incident happened on January 12 after Rachel dropped her children off at day care; at the time of the drop-off, the parents say Anders was awake and alert when she said goodbye to him.\n\n'Rachel looked at Anders and said, \"Bye buddy,\" and he kind of smiled back at her,' Ryne recalled to the publication. 'He was awake, but sleepy. And she left.'\n\nBut not long after, the little boy died while still napping in his car seat; an official investigation determined that Anders died of positional asphyxia, which occurs when a person's body position prevents them from breathing correctly.\n\nIn Anders' case, this resulted from his airway getting cut off after his chin dropped to his chest while he was sleeping in his car seat, which saw his body positioned on a slight upwards incline.\n\nAccording to Today Parents, the Jungling family is now working with Safe Kids Worldwide to better inform parents about the dangers of an infant sleeping in their car seat outside of the vehicle.\n\nResearchers at the University of Virginia Children's Hospital has previously warned about the dangers of sleep-related deaths in infants when launching an investigation published in The Journal of Pediatrics.\n\nThe investigation found almost 12,000 sleep-related deaths among infants between 2004 and 2014 in the US when the child was in a sitting device.\n\nHorrifying: An investigation determined Anders (pictured as an infant) died of positional asphyxia, which happened when his chin dropped in the seat and cut off his oxygen\n\nDetermined: 'Anders' death was 100 percent preventable,\u201d Ryne said. 'We want to make sure this never happens to anyone else.' The couple is raising awareness about their son's death\n\nNearly 220 youngsters died while in car seats \u2014 but only 0.2 per cent of the deaths occurred while they were travelling in a vehicle.\n\nWriting in the journal, lead researcher Dr. Rachel Moon said 'car seats are important when you're traveling with an infant'.\n\nBut she added: 'It's best not to have the infant sleep in the car seat when you're at home. The safest place for a baby to sleep is on a firm, flat surface.'\n\nThe Jungling family recently welcomed a son named Elias, but the new baby has not filled the hole left behind from Anders death.\n\n'Linnea was just 11 months old when Anders died,' Ryne said. 'One of our first questions was, \"How long will she remember him?\" Some brain research that we came across said that if you are a year old, you remember about six weeks. That was tough. That's why we keep talking about him.'\n\nPartnering with Safe Kids Worldwide, a nonprofit organization working with families to help prevent child-related injuries, is the family's way to help diminish the amount of children who die similarly to Anders.\n\n'Anders' death was 100 per cent preventable,\u201d Ryne said. 'We want to make sure this never happens to anyone else.'", "description": "Ryne and Rachel Jungling from North Dakota welcomed twins in January 2018.
