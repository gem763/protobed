I saw people who are usually quite shy of engaging in any kind of dissent rallying for signatures.\u201d\n\nEmbrace, the BBC black and minority ethnic staff network, which has 500 members, said it had written to BBC bosses to \u201cconvey the strength of feeling of both black and minority ethnic staff and non black and minority ethnic staff\u201d about the decision. \u201cThis action will destroy trust and damage the reputation of the BBC, and needs to be reversed. We await an urgent response,\u201d it said.\n\nIn the letter to Hall, organised by Labour\u2019s Seema Malhotra, the MPs called for an urgent meeting with the director genera. They said: \u201cIt is of particular concern that this decision has been reached when we are facing a rise in hate crime.\u201d\n\nThe BBC\u2019s editorial standards director, David Jordan, attempted to defuse the situation on Friday, telling Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that people may have \u201cwilfully\u201d misunderstood the nature of the ruling against Munchetty.\n\nHe said there was no doubt that Trump\u2019s original comments were racist, agreed that it was entirely within Munchetty\u2019s right to describe those comments as racist on air, and said the presenter was allowed to provide analysis to viewers about how a person of colour felt when they were told to \u201cgo home\u201d.\n\nHowever, Jordan insisted she had breached editorial guidelines because she appeared to make a judgment on Trump\u2019s personality, saying it is not the BBC\u2019s job to be \u201ccalling out people for being liars or racist\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cIn the politics of the present, when we are in a politics of name-calling and insult, I think it\u2019s probably unwise of the BBC to be calling out people for being liars or racist. What is really important is that we look at the things people say, we analyse them, we describe them objectively.\u201d\n\nLate on Friday afternoon in an email to all BBC staff, Hall and the BBC executive committee said: \u201cNaga Munchetty \u2013 one of our stars \u2013 was completely within her rights to speak about the tweets of Donald Trump which have been widely condemned as racist. We completely back her in saying \u2018as a woman of colour, to go back where I came from, that was embedded in racism\u2019. She was speaking honestly and from the heart about her own experiences. We admire her for it and she was completely justified in doing so.\u201d\n\nThe email ended by saying that diversity was \u201cnot negotiable\u201d.\n\nOne prominent black on-screen presenter said there was \u201cbafflement\u201d that Munchetty had been admonished when the likes of recently departed Today programme presenter John Humphrys were often perceived to have expressed personal opinions.\n\nThey said the incident had led to discussions among some non-white journalists that they are used as \u201cwindow dressing\u201d by the corporation\u2019s news bosses, despite the BBC having one of the most diverse workforces in British media.\n\nIn a letter published in the Guardian, the actors Lenny Henry, Adrian Lester and David Harewood, and presenters Krishnan Guru-Murthy and Gillian Joseph, are among signatories describing the decision as \u201cracially discriminatory treatment\u201d.\n\nThe letter\u2019s signatories, who also include the broadcaster and writer Afua Hirsch and the science journalist Angela Saini, say that BBC journalists have contacted them privately to express concern about the \u201cclimate of fear\u201d at the organisation and concerns over the consequences of their speaking out in support of the statement.\n\nAmong those who have also backed the presenter are the chancellor, Sajid Javid, who called the decision \u201cridiculous\u201d and added that Munchetty\u2019s reaction was \u201cperfectly understandable\u201d.\n\nSenior BBC news staff have raised concerns about the decision at the daily editorial management meetings.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople pointed out that Dan Walker encouraged that discussion,\u201d said one insider, who said there were real concerns among staff about how complaints system is not capable of dealing with members of the public acting in bad faith. \u201cIf Tommy Robinson is reading all of this he can just start complaining about BBC presenters day-in-day-out until one of the complaints lands.\u201d\n\nThere have been particular concerns within parts of the BBC that have large numbers of non-white journalists, such as BBC World and Asian Network, where managers say they have struggled to explain the nuance of the corporation\u2019s own decision to confused staff.\n\nBBC sources suggested the corporation is now backed into a corner, with no easy way to undo the ruling given the quasi-independence of the complaints unit, leaving management essentially unable to defuse the situation. The ruling did not come out of the blue but followed discussions with programme chiefs at BBC Breakfast, which has been in the process of transferring to a new editor this summer.\n\nIn an unusual move, Ofcom has agreed to assess Munchetty\u2019s exchange against its own broadcasting code after a request from the Labour MP Chi Onwurah. Its team are already reviewing the footage and a verdict on whether to launch an investigation is expected next week.\n\nThis would potentially undermine the BBC\u2019s own complaints process and heighten calls for the corporation\u2019s complaints procedures to be entirely outsourced to Ofcom, which has responsibility for enforcing standards in the rest of the broadcast media. At the moment the BBC has a special opt-out for early-stage complaints.\n\nMunchetty has so far declined to comment on the row, which has focused attention on the editorial complaints unit, the seven-strong arbiter of BBC values that is dominated by older, white men.\n\nMany non-white BBC journalists have called for increased clarity on who works for the unit and greater diversity in the complaints process.\n\nThe official finding of the complaints unit found that Munchetty was wrong to comment critically on the possible motive for, and potential consequences of, the president\u2019s words: \u201cJudgments of that kind are for the audience to make, and the exchange fell short of due impartiality in that respect.\u201d\n\nAt no point did Munchetty directly accuse Trump of being a racist in the brief exchange, which took place in response to questions on her personal feelings from her co-host, Walker.\n\nThe Labour MP Clive Lewis has also filed an early day motion to allow members of parliament to object: \u201cYou can\u2019t be \u2018impartial\u2019 on racism. There are certain values in democratic society which transcend impartiality, and we\u2019re entitled to call them out.\u201d\n\nLewis added: \u201cIt also goes to show that the level of BME representation at the BBC is only skin deep. It doesn\u2019t feel to me that there are enough people of colour in positions of editorial influence.\u201d", "description": "Corporation faces staff revolt over response to presenter\u2019s Donald Trump remarks", "authors": ["Jim Waterson", "Caroline Davies", "Heather Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90ea8a9c147ef484280f09e0c814c47a0c41e991/0_74_4175_2506/master/4175.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=45e025a01e1ea695f57e24239cc29f33", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
