REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nOfficials and diplomats involved in negotiations over the acrimonious divorce between the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy and its biggest trading bloc said that differences over the terms of the split had narrowed significantly.\n\nHowever, the European Union\u2019s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, made clear at a meeting of the bloc\u2019s ministers in Luxembourg that if an agreement could not be reached on Tuesday, it would be too late to send anything for leaders to approve at a summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday.\n\nBarnier also told EU ministers earlier on Tuesday that customs arrangements for the island of Ireland, the issue of giving more say to Northern Irish authorities as well as the so-called level-playing field clauses for fair competition were all still open.\n\nOn Tuesday night, an EU official said: \u201cWhat is outstanding is the level-playing field provisions... There would be no customs duties on goods crossing to Northern Ireland if they were to stay there.\u201d\n\nBut, as the clock struck midnight in Brussels, the talks were still going on between Britain\u2019s Brexit negotiator David Frost and the EU\u2019s executive European Commission.\n\nThat could force another extension of the date for the UK\u2019s split from the 27 other member states, the third since Britons voted in a June 2016 referendum to quit the EU.\n\nBritain\u2019s plan to leave the EU, which has only ever added new member states, has compounded problems for a bloc torn by euroscepticism and economic disparities.\n\nBritain has itself been polarised bitterly by Brexit.\n\nCLOSE, BUT NOT THERE YET\n\nA second EU official said an agreement was \u201cclose but not 100% certain\u201d, adding \u201cthere are still parts that need to be nailed down\u201d.\n\nSterling surged to its highest level against the dollar GBP=D3 and the euro since May on Tuesday on rising hopes for a deal.The main sticking point in talks has been the border between EU member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe question is how to prevent the border becoming a backdoor into the EU\u2019s single market without erecting controls which could undermine the 1998 peace agreement that ended decades of conflict in the province.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that talks had moved in the right direction.\n\n\u201cBut whether we will be able to conclude a revised withdrawal agreement, which after all is an international treaty, in time for the summit on Thursday, that\u2019s as of now unclear,\u201d he said, adding that some hours earlier the gap had been \u201cquite wide, particularly on the issue of customs.\u201d\n\nThe small Northern Irish party supporting Britain\u2019s minority government said further work was required to get a deal through.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is likely to need the Democratic Unionist Party\u2019s (DUP) support if he is to get it through a vote in the British parliament.\n\n\u201cWe respect (the) fact negotiations are ongoing therefore cannot give a detailed commentary but it would be fair to indicate gaps remain and further work is required,\u201d the DUP said in a statement.\n\nIf London is unable to clinch a deal, an acrimonious divorce could follow that would hit trade and business, roil financial markets and potentially lead to the United Kingdom splitting.\n\nWINNING UK PARLIAMENT\u2019S SUPPORT\n\nEven if Johnson wins the approval of Europe\u2019s big powers for the deal his negotiators have proposed, he must still sell it to a British parliament in which he does not command a majority.\n\nBrexit-supporting Conservative lawmaker Owen Paterson said Johnson\u2019s emerging divorce deal was \u201cunacceptable\u201d.\n\nA leading figure in the 2016 referendum who came to power as head of ruling Conservative Party in July, Johnson has pledged to take the country out of the bloc on Oct. 31 whether or not a withdrawal agreement has been reached.\n\nBut parliament has passed a law saying Britain cannot leave without an agreement, and Johnson has not explained how he can get around that.\n\nThe main obstacle has been around customs, with the latest proposal envisaging that Northern Ireland stays in the UK customs area. Tariffs would apply on goods crossing from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland if they were deemed to be headed further to EU member Ireland and the bloc\u2019s single market.\n\nA compromise of that order could be derailed in the UK parliament, where a rare Saturday session is due to be held this weekend.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nIndeed, the DUP insisted that the region must remain within the United Kingdom customs union as part of any Brexit deal and not have to follow tariffs set by the European Union.\n\nDeal or no deal for the summit, EU officials believe another delay to Britain\u2019s departure date is still likely.
