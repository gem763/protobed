About 2,000 workers will be let go in the coming days.\n\nThe facility in Homestead, Florida emptied out in August but had remained operational in case there was no room at shelters for teen migrants who cross the US-Mexico border and end up in government custody.\n\nInside America's biggest facility for migrant teens Read more\n\nHealth and Human Services said the decision to eliminate beds was to \u201censure fiscal prudence\u201d. Last month, Jonathan Hayes, the director of the department\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement, said the facility was costing $720,000 a day to run even when no children were staying there.\n\nIn a letter to Congress, the administration informed lawmakers that the facility was transitioning to \u201cwarm status\u201d with no beds but will retain access to the site in case the number of child migrants rises.\n\nA court filing earlier this year alleged the government was holding migrant children in \u201cprison-like conditions\u201d for months, allowing limited phone calls and ordering them to follow strict rules or face prolonged detention.\n\nThe facility underwent a massive expansion from 1,350 to 2,350 beds as the year began. In April, federal officials announced the capacity was growing to hold 3,200 children because of a surge of migrants crossing the southern border.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopefuls turned the Miami-area facility into a campaign stop to protest their detention this summer, when about 2,500 teens were held there. They attacked the administration for holding children in a cramped detention center run by a private company tied to the former White House chief of staff John Kelly.\n\nAs the homeland security secretary, Kelly first revealed the US government was considering separating families who were migrating to deter others considering traveling north.\n\nOfficials say the Florida facility housed as many as 140 children who were separated from their parents last year.\n\nThree months after leaving the Trump administration in January, Kelly was spotted by protesters touring the facility east of the Everglades in a golf cart.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bernie Sanders stands looks into a detention center for migrant children in Homestead, Florida, on 26 June 2019.

Five days later, that company was awarded a no-bid contract for $341m citing an immediate need to increase bed capacity.\n\nThe company later publicly announced Kelly had joined the board. The year before Kelly joined the Trump administration, he sat on the board of the Washington private equity firm DC Capital Partners, which bought Comprehensive Health Services and founded Caliburn by consolidating CHS and three other companies.\n\nCaliburn has in its executive suite a high-ranking military officer who advised Donald Trump in his first months in office and a former Department of Defense principal deputy inspector general.\n\nUS representative Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, the Democratic lawmaker representing the district encompassing the site, invited the 2020 Democratic candidates to visit the facility.\n\nAlong with other lawmakers, Mucarsel-Powell has pressed a government watchdog agency to investigate Kelly\u2019s role in the contracting negotiations.\n\n\u201cGiven Caliburn\u2019s poor record of child abuse and neglect, as well as the sheer number of former administration officials now serving on Caliburn\u2019s board, this is a good first step towards ending one of many corrupt practices this administration has executed,\u201d she said.", "description": "Detention center had come under criticism because of its conditions and ties to a former White House official", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19c850ccf7584d7c104ac556c8f6b3229db5b38f/0_71_2784_1670/master/2784.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fbba4eb9e893f1614927927910036334", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
