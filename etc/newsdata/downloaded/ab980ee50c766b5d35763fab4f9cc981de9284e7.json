And the other passenger, faced with this confusing scenario, willingly removed their bag to appease them.\n\nI have long subscribed to the idea that overhead baggage space, like online seating assignments, is allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. If you board late, you\u2019re shit out of luck and might be the one forced to check your carry-on at the gate. (This comes with the exception of airlines that restrict overhead baggage space by cabin class or don\u2019t allow carry-ons for basic economy flights.)\n\nIs it a dick move to place your bag above another passenger\u2019s seat? When you\u2019re the first to board\u2060 \u2014 or if you see plenty of space ahead \u2014 then perhaps. By stashing your bag above the first row seats, you\u2019re likely holding up the line when boarding. (You\u2019d probably want your bag closer to you anyway for the sake of convenience.)\n\nWhen passengers who sit upfront are forced to find another available space, they\u2019ll also have to go against the flow of passengers to return to their seat, delaying the boarding process. But when space is limited and passengers are clamoring for a bin as Joel described\u2014frankly, all bets are off and every available space is game.\n\nSo to our readers, we ask: Have you ever encountered someone who claimed the overhead bin above them? And what\u2019s your take on carry-on bag etiquette?", "description": "Earlier this week, we explained why you should never swap seats on a flight to make room for another passenger \u2014 but what about overhead space for their carry-on?...", "authors": ["Tooran Alizadeh", "Edward Helderop", "Tony Grubesic", "Lisa Rowan"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/yrtvatgihylgnpbs3sae.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
