If they're aware they have Lynch syndrome, they can take precautions against it and other cancers.\n\nIt\u2019s also beneficial because their family members can be identified.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResearch 'plugs a huge gap'\n\nThe study, conducted by Cancer Council Australia, found this routine testing would potentially prevent 80 bowel cancer deaths a year.\n\nAdjunct Professor Karen Canfell, senior author and chair of the council\u2019s Screening and Immunisation Committee, said this would mean about 165 extra colonoscopies a year in this high-risk group to prevent one bowel cancer death from Lynch syndrome.\n\nShe says Australia already has guidance recommending systematic testing for Lynch syndrome in newly diagnosed bowel cancer patients.\n\n\u201cThis comprehensive analysis of all the testing possibilities, completes the circle,\u201d Professor Canfell said.\n\nAt the moment, when you find you have it, you find yourself in a vacuum of support and care. \u2014 Susan Morris, Executive Director at Lynch Syndrome Australia\n\nTesting is currently being considered by the Medical Services Advisory Committee in Canberra, which advises on reimbursement on the Medical Benefits Scheme.\n\nIf approved, this testing would supplement the national program that mails out bowel cancer tests to all Australians aged 50 to 74.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year, it is estimated 16,400 Australians will develop bowel cancer and 5,600 will die from it. An estimated 3 per cent will have Lynch syndrome.\n\nSusan Morris, Executive Director at Lynch Syndrome Australia, says that while it can be \u201cvery confronting\u201d to be diagnosed, it can also be \u201ca relief\u201d because it provides an explanation to families who have endured a long history of cancers.\n\n\u201cThis research plugs a huge gap. Of the estimated 100,000 Australians with the mutation, only about 5 per cent of us know we are affected,\" she said.\n\n\u201cFinding and protecting these families is our first priority. At the moment, when you find you have it, you find yourself in a vacuum of support and care.\n\n\u201cThis research is just the start of a system to provide support and co-ordinated care for people with Lynch syndrome across Australia.\u201d\n\nCancer Council Australia encourages families with a high occurrence of the cancers mentioned above to see their GP and ask about genetic testing or to call 13 11 20 for more information.", "description": "Most people with Lynch syndrome don't know they have it.
