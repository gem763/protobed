Hundreds of millions of people worldwide who live in low-lying coastal areas, from villages to megacities, will experience more intense tropical cyclones and storms, extreme storm surges and flooding.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Although projections show there is an obvious reduction in rise following the greatest cuts in emissions.\u201d\n\nSeveral metres of sea-level rise is predicted for 2300 in a high-emissions world, meaning billions of people would be displaced.\n\nAnnual coastal flood damages are projected to increase 100 to 1,000 times by 2100, and some island nations are \u201clikely to become uninhabitable\u201d.\n\nWhile sea level has risen globally by around 15cm during the 20th century, it is currently rising more than twice as fast, at 3.6mm per year, and speeding up as Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets melt.\n\nSea levels could rise by around 30cm to 60cm by 2100 even if greenhouse gases are rapidly cut and global warming is kept to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, but around 60-110cm if emissions continue to increase, the study said.\n\n\u201cThe result is that ice is going to disappear faster than ever: some mountain regions such as the Alps could be almost completely deglaciated by 2100,\u201d said Professor Jonathan Bamber, director of the Bristol Glaciology Centre at the University of Bristol.\n\n\u201cSea level rise is projected to continue whatever the emission scenario and for something like business-as-usual the future for low lying coastal communities looks extremely bleak. The consequences will be felt by all of us.\u201d\n\nThe report also says marine heatwaves have very likely doubled in frequency since 1982 and are increasing in intensity. Wildfires are set to increase across the tundra and cold northern forests, as well as some mountain regions.\n\nThe oceans have helped limit the impact of greenhouse gases so far, absorbing much of the extra heat and carbon dioxide, but that has affected the survival of fish stocks and wildlife such as corals, a situation set to worsen.\n\nAnd the melting permafrost contains large stores of greenhouse gases which could be released into the atmosphere as the frozen ground thaws, adding to global warming.\n\nProfessor Peter Wadhams, professor of ocean physics at the University of Cambridge, said the report did not mention the \u201cvery serious threat\u201d of methane coming from the seabed of the Arctic continental shelf as its permafrost thaws \u2013 which could release large amounts of the greenhouse gas.\n\nThe latest report comes after a major study from the UN science body last year said unprecedented and rapid action was needed to keep global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\n\nHoesung Lee, chairman of the IPCC, said: \u201cThe open sea, the Arctic, the Antarctic and the high mountains may seem far away to many people.\n\n\u201cBut we depend on them and are influenced by them directly and indirectly in many ways \u2013 for weather and climate, for food and water, for energy, trade, transport, recreation and tourism, for health and wellbeing, for culture and identity.\n\n\u201cIf we reduce emissions sharply, consequences for people and their livelihoods will still be challenging, but potentially more manageable for those who are most vulnerable.\u201d\n\nNearly half of the world\u2019s coastal wetlands, which protect from erosion and flooding and are important carbon stores, have been lost over the last 100 years, as a result of human activity, sea level rises, warming and extreme events.\n\nUrgent and ambitious emissions reductions are needed alongside coordinated, sustained and increasingly ambitious action to help people adapt to the changes that are taking place, researchers found.\n\nRod Downie, chiefpolar adviser at WWF, said: \u201cI like to think of ice as one of humanity\u2019s best investments. It\u2019s a bit like having capital in your bank account. And we want it to stay there.\n\n\u201cWe want the ice to remain in the polar regions. But instead we\u2019re eating into it, we\u2019re dissolving it. We\u2019re spending that capital and that has really dramatic consequences for people in the Arctic, and for people across the world, including here in the UK.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by PA", "description": "Sea levels could rise by a metre by 2100, according to the latest landmark UN report which warns that many serious impacts of climate change are already inevitable, whether emissions are curbed or not.
