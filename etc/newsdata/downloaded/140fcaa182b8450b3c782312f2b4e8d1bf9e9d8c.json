Exeter scored one try of their own courtesy of Jonny Hill with Joe Simmonds kicking five points.\n\n\u201cI lost my temper with the lads in the changing room because I do feel like as much as Bath pressurised us you don\u2019t really create a high tackle,\u201d said Baxter.\n\n\u201cIf you give away penalties like that you are handing back momentum to the opposition and it\u2019s game over especially in such bad conditions. I\u2019m frustrated because not only did we do it once or twice we then refused to learn our lessons.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t learn your lessons that\u2019s more annoying than anything else.\u201d\n\nExeter dominated the first-half with the Bath defence repelling wave after wave of sustained pressure as they lay siege to the home sides line. But Bath\u2019s defensive line was only breached once when Hill powered his way over from short range.", "description": "Bath 13 Exeter 10", "authors": ["Steffan Thomas", "Danny Cipriani", "Maggie Alphonsi"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-union/2019/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000214140267-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq7X6VyzhDDWIHt8iEvIltgnag7UcI-JeH9OC_1wxTiVQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
