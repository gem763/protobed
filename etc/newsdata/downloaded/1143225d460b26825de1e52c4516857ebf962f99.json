As a result, the Amway Coaches Poll looks considerably different with significant movement in the top five.\n\nAlabama retained the top ranking, easily getting by Arkansas despite the absence of quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. The Crimson Tide received 40 of 65 first-place votes heading into their open date. Up next on Nov. 9 is a showdown with the new No. 2 team. LSU.\n\nThe Tigers, who held off Auburn in a hard-hitting affair Saturday, picked up seven No. 1 nods and overtook Clemson for the second position by seven poll points. Coincidentally, the last time the top two teams in the Amway Coaches Poll met during the regular season was in 2011, also Alabama and LSU. The Tigers are also off this weekend.\n\nLSU running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire celebrates a touchdown run during the third quarter against Auburn.
