Although that makes more sense when you consider that both games are planned for the PlayStation 5 and next gen Xbox, so half of it is just avoiding them having to be on current gen consoles as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEA will also want to take their time given the poor response to Battlefield V. And while Dragon Age: Inquisition was more warmly received by fans the reputation of developer BioWare has taken a severe knock since the more recent Mass Effect: Andromeda and Anthem.\n\nA new Battlefield has never been mentioned in public before, so there\u2019s no clue as to what its setting might be \u2013 although most fans are hoping that it\u2019ll be a return to the modern era and possibly Bad Company 3.\n\nTechnically, Dragon Age 4 was confirmed in early 2018 and got a teaser trailer at last year\u2019s The Game Awards, but there\u2019s been virtually no information about it or its story.\n\nIn the interim, EA has said that Apex Legends will count as its annual shooter for now, even though it\u2019s just one continually updated game in the manner of Fortnite.\n\nThere will be a mobile version next year and a big push into China, although when asked EA chief financial officer Blake Jorgensen did say that they hadn\u2019t forgotten about Titanfall.\n\nA new Titanfall wasn\u2019t mentioned in any of their plans though, and neither was a new Battlefront game \u2013 or indeed any new Star Wars game beyond next month\u2019s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: BioWare discuss \u2018super-secret\u2019 new games, reconfirms Dragon Age 4\n\nMORE: Dragon Age 4 development fears raised in latest BioWare expos\u00e9\n\nMORE: Battlefield V review \u2013 come back later", "description": "It\u2019s going to be a long wait for new Battlefield and Dragon Age games, as EA confirm the next sequels will be on PS5 and Project Scarlett.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/dragon-age_1572429255.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
