App launch speeds will also be twice as fast, thanks to downloads shrinking by 50 percent and updates by 60 percent. iOS 13 will also get 'Dark Mode', which has long been available among its many competitors. It boasts an inverted color palette for a sleeker design that's easier on the eyes. In addition, iOS 13 will include a newly-designed share sheet and brings updates for Safari, Mail, Notes, and Reminders. 'Safari now has per-website preferences, Mail has new desktop formatting, and Notes will now have shared folders,' Apple's Craig Federighi revealed. 'Reminders is now smarter, and can guess when to remind you of certain tasks.' Apple's iOS 13 will be available for the iPhone 6s and later handsets, and is packed with an array of changes \u2013 such as video editing, menstrual tracking and improved privacy features. Apple's Photo app is also getting smarter, and will soon automatically separate your screenshots from your main images. iOS 13 will also come with more advanced photo editing options, including Portrait Lighting adjustments. Apple Maps is also getting a major overhaul slated to become available by the end of 2019, with a focus on keeping things 'private and secure.' This will include a new favorites section for different locations, shareable lists, and personalized lists based on your trips. And your location data will now come with more protections. 'Sharing your location with a third party app can really enable some useful third-party experiences,' said Director of Product Research, Meg Frost. 'For the first time you can share your location with an app just once and then require it to ask again the next time it wants it. 'And if you do choose to grant an app to continually monitor your location in the background, we'll give you reports on what they're up to. 'Some apps try to infer your location through Bluetooth connections, etc. We're shutting the door on that abuse as well.'\n\nThe team used two robotic arms for the tests, which interacted with the smartphones \u2013 they went online, sent emails, searched locations on Google Maps and more.\n\nAfter just two hours into the experiment, the Dark Mode iPhone was on 88 percent and Light Mode handset had dropped to 83 percent.\n\nAt four hours, Dark Mode was on 72 percent while Light Mode had just 57 percent.\n\nThe Light Mode iPhone went dead at seven hours and 33 minutes, while the Dark Mode phone still had 30 percent left in its battery.\n\nHowever, the YouTubers noted that results may vary, as battery life will depend on how bright the screen is set, the iPhone model and other factors.", "description": "Multiple reports from iPhone owners have surfaced, claiming iOS 13.1.2 is draining battery life in just a few hours - and some said devices are also heating up while charging.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/16/20186538-0-image-a-39_1572017469155.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
