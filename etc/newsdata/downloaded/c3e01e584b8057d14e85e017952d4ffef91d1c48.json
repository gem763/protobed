And it's a year that's been full of concern about trade fights, a global recession, impeachment proceedings, and disappointing IPOs from some of the decade's defining tech names.\n\nBut it has also been an awesome year for stocks.\n\nThrough Wednesday's close, the S&P 500 is up 19.2% year-to-date.\n\nIn a note to clients published this week, Tom Lee at FundStrat reminded readers that the S&P 500 is still tracking for its best year since 1998. Lee said this confirms his view that the best analogue for 2019 isn't a recent pre-recession year like 1999 or 2007, but instead the post-crisis rebound year of 2009.\n\nAnd it could get better still.\n\n\u201cGiven our view that PMIs are bottoming (rates confirming) and the strong 4Q seasonals, we see the S&P 500 on track to exceed our nearly Street high view of 3,125,\u201d Lee said. On Wednesday, the stock market closed at 2,989.69, implying a roughly 5% rally for the market through the end of the year.\n\nOf course, the calendar is ultimately arbitrary. And simply benchmarking the performance of stocks to the beginning of this year ignores what's been a challenging two-year period for investors.\n\nTraders signal offers in the S&P 500 stock index futures pit at the Chicago Mercantile January 22, 2008.

A disappointing 21 months considering the S&P 500's average annual return is just under 10%.\n\nThe Fed's pivot at the beginning of this year to move from its most restrictive monetary policy stance in more than a decade to easing policy as aggressively as we've seen since before the crisis has also supported financial markets this year. And as we've seen time and again this decade, when the Fed gets involved many investors get upset.\n\nEconomic data released Wednesday also proved once again why it's been so hard for investors to admit and accept that this has been a great year for the market. Because the economy, all else equal, doesn\u2019t exactly seem like an environment that would be supporting a 20% rally in stocks.\n\nRetail sales for the month of September were a flop, falling 0.3% from the prior month \u2014 the biggest miss relative to expectations since February \u2014 and confirming that the U.S. economy is indeed slowing down.\n\nMichael Pearce at Capital Economics did note, however, that annualized retail sales growth for the third quarter was still an \u201cunusually\u201d 7.3%. And the team at Bespoke Investment Group said Wednesday that after six straight months of increases in retail sales, it was inevitable there would be a give back. Especially considering the strong upward revisions to August's data.\n\nWednesday also saw the release of homebuilder sentiment data which revealed that U.S. builders haven't been this confident since February 2018. As Neil Dutta at Renaissance Macro said Wednesday, \"Things are fine.\"\n\n\"While the growth bears focus on September retail sales, we've seen a drumbeat of solid survey data in October.\u201d\n\nBy Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.
