Enough, say, to fill an entire BBC Question Time panel and audience every week for the next 20 years.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSo quite what she made of her starring role in Monday morning\u2019s Tory Party election manifesto launch we are also unlikely ever to know.\n\nPeople are, understandably, mocking the Conservative Party, for hauling the Queen over to the Houses of Parliament in her little golden carriage, to announce a range of new policies they know cannot possibly pass because they are currently trying to govern with a working majority of minus 45.\n\nBut in many ways, it was genius. Getting Her Majesty herself to read out all your policies for the general election you\u2019re going to have just as soon as the opposition lets you is a PR triumph.\n\nOne imagines they\u2019ll be feeling almost as smug as the Remain campaign, when they bagged the Beckham and Obama endorsements, which you\u2019ll recall worked out very well for them.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just that. It also makes life easier for the media. The time-honoured tradition now, with Tory election manifestos and indeed budgets, is they detonate shortly after they\u2019ve been read out, like a briefing note sent to Inspector Gadget.\n\nWhen Theresa May dragged all of Westminster to a mill in Halifax two years ago, it took journalists at least two hours to find the dementia tax explosives carefully packed within, and then light the fuse that would in effect, end the Theresa May show.\n\nOn this occasion, everybody knows nothing in it can possibly pass through the House of Commons without an election, meaning the speech arrived pre-collapsed.\n\nThe watching world was spared the trouble even of having to discover the self-evident absurdity within it. The absurdity was the thing itself.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. The world\u2019s ten most beautiful parliament buildings Show all 10 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

As always, there was the man standing behind the Queen in a 45 grand tabard, wearing women\u2019s tights he buys himself from John Lewis.\n\nOthers were on hand, naturally, to fiddle with the train of the Robe of State as it made its way between the Cap of Maintenance and the Sword of State.\n\nSomeone whose actual job title, 365 days a year, is Black Rod, did her thing where she smote with her stick upon the door of the Commons and had it slammed in her face.\n\nThen there's the crown with huge diamonds in, gathered in morally dubious circumstances from the far corners of what was once the empire.\n\nIf it\u2019s your kind of thing, all this stuff is vaguely fun, when you\u2019re an otherwise normal country.\n\nA carefully honed pageant of a kind of glorious managed decline. A sovereign brought to heel, and reminded each year she is kept in place at only the people\u2019s discretion (all this is embodied in the Black Rod door slam, by the way).\n\nAn empire allowed to win its liberty with only the bare minimum amount of torture visited upon it, now replaced with a commonwealth.\n\nBut this stuff does ring a touch off-key when you\u2019re an international basket case.\n\nAll this stuff is meant to project an image of wealth and power, the majesty of statehood.\n\nNow, it just looks like a mad perfume advert. A realm in rapid decline, fiddling with itself while Rome burns.", "description": "It is a fact never worth forgetting in this, the age of Hot Takes, that the sole reason the Queen is universally admired is that she has never given an opinion on anything.
