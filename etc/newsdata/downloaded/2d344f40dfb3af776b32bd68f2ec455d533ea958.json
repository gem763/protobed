The Libra token itself may also be a security, but Facebook (NASDAQ: ) does not intend to pay dividends and it is unclear if investors would have a \u2018reasonable expectation of profits,\u2019\u201d the document said.\n\nSeparately, Clayton said in the \u201cDelivering Alpha\u201d conference on Thursday that Bitcoin will need more regulation before it could be allowed to be traded on a major exchange.\n\n\u201cIf [investors] think there\u2019s the same rigor around that price discovery as there is on the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange... They are sorely mistaken. [...] We have to get to a place where we can be confident that trading is better regulated.\u201d\n\nCiting his remarks, CNBC said all previous attempts to bring Bitcoin to the mainstream have been blocked by regulators due to concerns of the digital coins\u2019 volatile nature.", "description": "Bitcoin Rises Above $10,000; U.S. Congress to Discuss Crypto with SEC on Sept 24", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEF310CO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
