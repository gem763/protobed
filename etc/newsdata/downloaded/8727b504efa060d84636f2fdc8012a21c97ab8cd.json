He walked straight down the tunnel and, cupping his ears to the crowd, appeared to mouth \u201cfuck off\u201d. Emery was firm in saying Xhaka had been out of order and said he would speak with the player before making any further decisions.\n\n\u201cHe was wrong, he was wrong,\u201d Emery said. \u201cBut I think now [we] stay calm and also speak with him, speak inside around that. His reaction was wrong. We are here because we have supporters. In football we are the workers inside [the pitch] but we play for them. We need to have respect for them when they are applauding us and also when they are criticising us.\u201d\n\nMohamed Salah holds his nerve as Liverpool put Spurs to the sword Read more\n\nAsked about Xhaka\u2019s future suitability as captain, a role that was bestowed upon him on a full-time basis in September, Emery said he could offer nothing concrete until internal discussions had been held. This was not the first time the Emirates Stadium crowd had taken badly to Xhaka, who was also jeered off \u2013 albeit not to this extent \u2013 in the win against Aston Villa five weeks ago. \u201cIt\u2019s not the moment to speak about that,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst I want to speak with him and speak with the club, and we want to stay calm.\u201d\n\nMuch of Emery\u2019s post-match energy was spent lamenting the VAR decisions that went against his team, awarding Crystal Palace a penalty and then disallowing what seemed a good late winner by Sokratis Papastathopoulos. He is a longtime advocate of the technology but frustrations have crept in of late, with Emery also feeling that Sokratis should have been given a spot-kick in the defeat at Sheffield United on Monday. \u201cIn our last [home league] match against Bournemouth we had a more clear penalty on [Nicolas] P\u00e9p\u00e9 and they didn\u2019t check,\u201d he said. \u201cLast week in Sheffield we deserved a clear penalty at 0-0, a very important moment, and they didn\u2019t check.\n\n\u201cFor me VAR is positive and we need VAR. But we need to manage it in the right way. At the moment for us I think it\u2019s not working well.\u201d\n\nThe Crystal Palace manager, Roy Hodgson, felt Arsenal\u2019s second goal should have been subjected to a VAR check after a push by Alexandre Lacazette. Hodgson, though, felt the system \u201cshowed its true merits\u201d when his team were correctly awarded a penalty after the video official overruled Martin Atkinson\u2019s decision to book Wilfried Zaha for diving under a challenge from Calum Chambers.\n\n\u201cI thought the character and desire we\u2019ve shown was really exceptional,\u201d Hodgson said of Palace\u2019s subsequent comeback.", "description": "The Arsenal manager has refused to rule out stripping the midfielder of the captaincy following the 2-2 draw against Crystal Palace", "authors": ["Nick Ames"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/993a9b8a19c74a87a048685b38bb15e547fcead2/0_211_3182_1910/master/3182.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3e173f3ebf000837de7a34c42a9430ee", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
