REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nNEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ambitious American lawmakers crafting an antitrust shopping list are putting Amazon near the top. Jeff Bezos\u2019 $880 billion retailing behemoth deepened its hold on consumers again in the third quarter. The dominant internet retailer spent heavily on faster shipping, propelling revenue growth of 24%. Ruthless expansion in areas, such as advertising, where its existing operations give it a leg up, and new markets such as healthcare, bring a showdown with City Hall closer than ever.\n\nAmazon\u2019s best defense against critics remains that it doesn\u2019t act like a traditional monopolist. Instead of soaking consumers and maximizing profits, it keeps prices low, subsidizes delivery, and expands. That doesn\u2019t always please investors \u2013 the stock fell sharply after earnings disappointed.\n\nYet the firm\u2019s growing power, and especially its ability to use digital dominance to best rivals, increasingly makes European regulators and American lawmakers uneasy. Take internet advertising. Items not on the first page might as well not exist for many shoppers, forcing sellers to pay up to be a featured good. Amazon doesn\u2019t break out advertising, but it accounts for most of the \u201cother\u201d line in the firm\u2019s sales, which grew over 40%.\n\nSure, the company\u2019s relatively lackluster estimated revenue growth of 11% to 20% in the fourth quarter may indicate competition is heating up \u2013 but this will only make Bezos more aggressive.\n\nAmazon has been touting initiatives that help society and provide political cover. This week it announced renewable energy projects and funding for high school computer science classes. It may not be enough. On Thursday, White House hopeful Senator Elizabeth Warren asked the Federal Trade Commission to see if a security lapse in Amazon servers was partly to blame for a Capital One Financial hack that affected 100 million people.\n\nIt\u2019s a matter of time before Bezos faces a D.C. grilling, which he has avoided so far. On Wednesday, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg made another public appearance before Congress. Sundar Pichai of Google and Jack Dorsey of Twitter have also endured hearings.\n\nRegulators are also watching Bezos\u2019 expansion into new markets. This week, Amazon purchased Health Navigator, which can digitally triage patients. The firm\u2019s small size means this deal won\u2019t be in lawmakers\u2019 crosshairs. But Amazon\u2019s own shopping, and the perception that regulators too easily permitted its $13.7 billion Whole Foods Market acquisition, means future M&A will face tougher criticism.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Ambitious American lawmakers crafting an antitrust shopping list are putting Amazon near the top.
