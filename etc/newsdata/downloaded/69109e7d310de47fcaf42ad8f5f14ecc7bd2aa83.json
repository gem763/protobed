Add Interest\n\nThe court heard arguments in three cases involving individuals who say they were fired because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The plaintiffs argued that the plain text of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, applies to them.\n\n\u201cWhen an employer fires a male employee for dating men but does not fire female employees who date men, he violates Title VII,\u201d argued Pamela Karlan, counsel for former Georgia child welfare services coordinator, Gerald Bostock, who says he was fired for being gay.\n\n\u201cThe employer has \u2026 discriminated against the man because he treats that man worse than women who want to do the same thing,\u201d said Karlan, \u201cand that discrimination is because of sex.\u201d\n\nThe argument was intended to appeal to the court\u2019s conservative majority, which for years has professed an obligation to strict interpretation of a statute\u2019s text.\n\nCharles William Kelly\n\nIn the case of Aimee Stephens, a transgender Michigan woman who was fired from her job at a funeral home after notifying her employer of her gender identity, Justice Elena Kagan suggested the application of the law was clear.\n\n\u201cThe claim here is that Harris Homes is treating her differently because the sex assigned at birth. That\u2019s discrimination because of sex,\u201d Kagan said.\n\nWhen counsel for the funeral home, John Bursch, argued that the firing was because of a dress code that was equally applied to all employees, Justice Neil Gorsuch seemed open to siding with Stephens. \u201cIsn\u2019t sex also at play here, and isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d he said of federal anti-discrimination rules.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito was publicly skeptical, suggesting the meaning of \u2018sex\u2019 in 1964 when Congress wrote the law should not be dismissed.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to change the meaning of what Congress understood as \u2018sex\u2019 in 1964,\u201d said Alito, challenging the plaintiffs.\n\n\u201cIn 1964, those were the days of Mad Men,\u201d quipped Karlan at one point.\n\n\u201cIf the Court takes this up and interprets this 1964 statute to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, we will be acting exactly like a legislature,\u201d Alito said.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg pointed out that the court has already adopted a more expansive view of discrimination protection on the basis of sex in the years since Congress passed the law.\n\n\u201cNo one thought sexual harassment was a thing in 1964,\u201d she said. But the court now recognizes that Title VII prohibits sexual harassment. As several justices noted during the argument, the court has also held that Title VII prohibits \"sex stereotyping,\" as well as same-sex sexual harassment.\n\nSusan Walsh/AP, FILE\n\nIn a 1989 case, the court ruled in favor of a female accountant who was denied a promotion because she was viewed as not conforming to her employer's expectations about how women should talk, dress, and behave. All of the plaintiffs argued that that case provides important support for their position.\n\nOver two hours of arguments, the justices seemed most preoccupied with the implications of their decision in this case and what it would mean for intense national debate over bathroom facilities for transgender people and participation of transgender athletes in sex-separate collegiate sports.\n\n\u201cThere are male and female bathrooms, there are dress codes that are otherwise innocuous -- most people would find them innocuous,\u201d said Gorsuch. \u201cBut the affected communities will not, and they will find harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cAssume it\u2019s close,\u201d he said later. \u201cAt the end of the day, should we take into account the massive social upheaval and legislative history?\u201d\n\nChief Justice John Roberts raised concern about religious organizations and their concerns with employing gay, lesbian and transgender people.\n\n\u201cIf we're going to be extending the understanding of what sex encompasses,\u201d said Roberts, \u201chow do we address that other concern\u201d of religious exemptions?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no upheaval,\u201d argued David Cole, attorney with the ACLU, defending Stephens. Religious exemptions, he said, already exist under federal law.\n\nCole and attorneys for the plaintiffs urged the justices to rule narrowly, saying implications for bathrooms and sports could be dealt with later in future cases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking you to update the statue or redefine sex,\u201d Cole said. We\u2019re asking you to recognize \u201cthat transgender people have the right to be in a workplace because of who they are.\u201d\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nWhile the three cases were consolidated for argument, the court could offer split opinions in the cases involving sexual orientation and gender identity or could find that Title VII applies to both categories, on the basis of \"sex.\"\n\nThe justices are expected to release their opinion in early 2020.\n\nABC News' Kate Shaw contributed to this report.", "description": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday wrestled openly for the first time with employment discrimination against gay, lesbian and transgender Americans.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/lgbt1-rt-ml-191008_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
