Gavin Newsom on Friday. Senate Bill 24 by state Sen. Connie Leyva (D-Chino) will go into effect in 2023, with the University of California and California State University systems required to offer students medical abortions. A medical abortion is a nonsurgical way to terminate a pregnancy that involves taking two prescription pills hours apart during a woman\u2019s first 10 weeks of pregnancy to induce a miscarriage. It is different than the morning-after pill, which releases a high dose of a synthetic hormone found in birth control pills that delays or stops the release of an egg.\"\n\nGov. Newsom told the LA Times that California is \"removing barriers to reproductive health -- increasing access on college campuses and using technology to modernize how patients interact with providers.\"\n\n\"As other states and the federal government go backward, restricting reproductive freedom, in California we are moving forward, expanding access and reaffirming a woman\u2019s right to choose,\" he added.\n\nAs Townhall has covered, studies show that \"medicated abortions\" will have long-lasting impacts on the women who take the \"medicine.\"\n\nNeuroscientist Dr. Stephen Sammut of Franciscan University recently completed a three-year study on the abortion pill. Here's what he had to say:\n\nvia Townhall: \u201cIt is alarming to think that these drugs could be easily acquired given the potential for negative consequences of medical abortion as indicated by our study (at the preclinical level) and the insufficient/absent research at the preclinical level of the potential consequences of drug-induced abortion on the body, the brain and consequently behavior of the mother,\u201d Sammut told Townhall. \u201cHormones have a powerful influence on our body, our immune system, our brain and ultimately our behavior, and drugs such as mifepristone, that interfere with hormonal function, should be treated with great caution and prudence and administered with great care.\u201d\n\nLive Action founder and president Lila Rose told Townhall in a statement, \"It is a travesty that Governor Newsom has signed into law this bill which turns universities into abortion centers and perpetuates the lie that women need to kill their children in order to achieve their dreams and goals.\"\n\n\"Chemical abortions are a serious matter, ending a life and often involving days of bleeding and clotting that can have serious complications for the mom. Young women will be enduring this harmful abortion procedure in their college dorms and bathrooms without proper medical support,\" she added.\n\n\"This law will only increase the state\u2019s abortion rate. The legislature that pushed this bill has done nothing to support pregnancy, parenting, or adoption which would open up authentic choices for women,\" Rose stated. \"Instead of this harmful legislation, politicians should pursue policies that empower young women to choose life.\"\n\nCalifornia students who support the bill argue they simply need the taxpayer provided medicated abortion because traveling to a clinic is too much of a burden to bear.\n\nvia The LA Times: \u201cThe clinic closest to my campus was almost 11 miles away and a 45-minute bus ride one way,\u201d said Zoe Murray, a recent UC Santa Barbara graduate who sought an abortion three years ago while she was a sophomore at the school. \u201cNot every student has a car on campus and certainly not every student can afford to miss classes, their jobs or their families for that much time.\u201d\n\nAs I have previously written, excuses like these show that \"the abortion movement does not view the killing of children in the womb as something tragic, but as something that should be celebrated and accessible.\"", "description": ".10/11/2019 20:15:07PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/211/5d30baa4-7d4f-4f6f-8b2a-d1f18ada0540.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
