REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth/File Photo\n\nSSE\u2019s retail energy business is the third-largest supplier of the \u201cbig six\u201d in the British market, supplying energy and related services to around 3.5 million household customers.\n\nOvo, set up only 10 years ago, has expanded to be Britain\u2019s largest independent energy supplier, with 1.5 million customers.\n\nThe deal comes after SSE and Germany\u2019s Innogy (IGY.DE) scrapped plans last year to merge their British energy retail operations.\n\nSuppliers have been hit hard by a price cap on tariffs and cut-throat competition, prompting them to review the options for their businesses.\n\nThe SSE-Innogy plan, more than a year in the making, collapsed after the companies failed to agree on new commercial terms in light of the proposed cap on energy bills.\n\nSSE shares hit their highest in over four months after the announcement. The stock was 1.7% higher at 1,185.5 pence by 0711 GMT, making the stock the second biggest gainer on London's bluechip index .FTSE.\n\nBritain\u2019s big six energy suppliers are Centrica\u2019s (CNA.L) British Gas, SSE, Iberdrola\u2019s (IBE.MC) Scottish Power, Innogy\u2019s npower, E.ON (EONGn.DE) and EDF\u2019s (EDF.PA) EDF Energy.\n\nNEW FOCUS\n\nProceeds from the sale, which involves 400 million pounds in cash and 100 million pounds in loan notes, will be used to reduce SSE\u2019s net debt, the company said on Friday.\n\nThe deal is expected to be completed in late 2019 or early 2020, subject to regulatory approvals. All of SSE Energy\u2019s about 8,000 employees will transfer to OVO, SSE said.\n\n\u201cWe see this deal as positive for SSE as it gets rid of a business unit which has been a drag on the overall group and helps to refocus attention on the core business of Networks and Renewables,\u201d Bernstein analysts said.\n\nThe SSE Energy Services unit reported pretax profit of 35.3 million pounds in the year ended March.\n\n\u201cWe have long believed that a dedicated, focused and independent retailer will ultimately best serve customers, employees and other stakeholders,\u201d Chief Executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said in a statement.\n\nJefferies analysts said the disposal represents an important step forward in SSE\u2019s strategy to re-orientate the business towards networks and renewables.\n\nThe deal also comes after SSE kicked off the process to sell its 140 million cubic feet per day portfolio of North Sea gas fields in a single package, a sale document seen by Reuters showed last month.", "description": "SSE has agreed to sell its British retail energy business to OVO Group for 500 million pounds, catapulting a relative newcomer to a leading role among the country's electricity suppliers.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429370334&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0LX", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
