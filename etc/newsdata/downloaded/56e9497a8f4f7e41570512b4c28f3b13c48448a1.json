The union said the move would \"cripple\" deliveries.\n\n'I feel like quitting'\n\nOne worker, who wanted to remain anonymous, said she has worked all but two Saturdays since March.\n\nShe said it was getting in the way of seeing her husband, grandchildren and using her caravan, as she does not get two days off together.\n\n\"I feel like a zombie most of the time,\" she added. \"I felt like quitting at one point but why should I have to give up my job after almost two decades?\n\n\"I've never gone on strike before but I will now. Something needs to be done, they have to listen to us.\"\n\nImage copyright Google Image caption The Worksop distribution centre will see 1,200 people walk out\n\nMs Savage said the values of the Wilkinson family, which owns the firm, did not extend to its employees.\n\nShe added: \"Wilko prides itself on being a family-run company but they're imposing contracts that will force staff to work on the weekends, splitting up family time, without the agreement of their employees.\n\n\"The numbers show how strongly people feel about this.\"\n\nA spokesman for Wilko said the firm shared workers' frustrations and is trying to reduce the number of weekends staff will work by recruiting more people.\n\nHe said it would also give 250 team members an additional weekend off, but the union said this had not yet made an impact.\n\nThe spokesman added: \"The reality is that our customers expect to shop with us seven days a week and we must respond to meet our customers' needs.\n\n\"There are robust plans in place to ensure customers can continue to shop with us if any action occurs.\"\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.
