REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo\n\nCarmakers should stop developing large, heavy cars and vehicles with internal combustion engines, the \u201cExit\u201d consortium said at a news conference on the eve of the Frankfurt auto show.\n\n\u201cAs long as SUVs rather than small electric vehicles dominate automotive transport, cars will remain the problem child for us climate activists,\u201d the consortium said.\n\nIn a debate with the lead spokeswoman from \u201cSand in the Gearbox\u201d - a coalition of activists who see the automobile as an outmoded form of transport and called for a boycott of the show - Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess said his company was primarily committed to providing individual mobility and that ultimately, consumers decide what they buy.\n\nVolkswagen had developed several frugal and zero-emission vehicles, including the VW Lupo, which had ultimately proven less popular that larger more spacious cars, Diess said.\n\n\u201cSUVs is what the customer wants,\u201d Diess said while underscoring Volkswagen\u2019s commitment to building affordable electric vehicles as well.\n\n\u201cOwning a car is for many people part of having a higher quality of life. We need to ensure that even middle and lower income families can afford an electric car,\u201d Diess said.\n\nRegulators have in their power to incentivise buying behaviour, the German executive said, rejecting a call for an outright ban of cars or certain types of vehicle.\n\nSwitching to renewable forms of energy and cutting dependence on coal-fired power stations was another way to push climate goals, Diess added.\n\nThe German automaker is preparing to launch a raft of hybrid and electric vehicles to try to leave behind a diesel emissions cheating scandal which has cost the company more than 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in refit costs and fines.\n\nHybrid vehicles can help cut carbon dioxide pollution, carmakers say.\n\n\u201cThese fake arguments brought forward by the industry are exactly the reason why we are taking to the streets,\u201d said the spokeswoman for Sand in the Gearbox, which has called for a blockade of the Frankfurt show and increased use of bicycles.\n\n\u201cVolkswagen is by definition interested in selling more cars, so they are not really part of the solution,\u201d said the spokeswoman, who declined to give her real name, but calls herself Tina Velo.\n\nActivists say job losses among the auto industry\u2019s 800,000 workers in Germany could be recouped via extra investments in public transport and railways.\n\nThose assembly workers who were still out of a job could be retrained to work in care homes, Velo said.\n\n($1 = 0.9052 euros)", "description": "Climate groups, including Greenpeace and Deutsche Umwelthilfe, called on Monday for sport-utility vehicles to be banned as part of a wider campaign to curb pollution by the auto industry.", "authors": ["Edward Taylor", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427952843&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF88163", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
