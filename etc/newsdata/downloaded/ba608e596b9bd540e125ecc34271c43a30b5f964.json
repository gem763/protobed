Dr FitzGerald was a senior Treasury official leading the government's national savings review at the time.\n\nKaren Chester, who was a junior Treasury economist on Dr FitzGerald's savings review in 1993, recommended in her Productivity Commission report last year that the government instigate an independent inquiry into the retirement income system before any possible increase in the super guarantee.\n\nDr FitzGerald said Ms Chester's call for an inquiry \"makes a lot of sense\" because the retirement system hadn't had a comprehensive government review since his national savings report for Mr Keating 26 years ago.\n\nDr FitzGerald's view on super has evolved since January, when he told the Financial Review that he supported the scheduled rise in the super guarantee to 12 per cent.\n\nGrattan Institute research suggests the super guarantee increase will remove $20 billion from the pockets of workers each year.\n\nDr FitzGerald said he did not agree with all of the Grattan analysis.\n\nThe government was \u201cmorally\u201d obliged to improve the superannuation system ahead of a legislated increase in the super guarantee to 12 per cent, Assistant Minister for Superannuation Jane Hume said in June.", "description": "The economist who led Paul Keating's inquiry into compulsory superannuation said the Morrison government should slow the increase in the super guarantee to 12 per cent to boost the sluggish economy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0624%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_188/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/55c0ff7dad80069df4f1d47754adb728363506ec", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
