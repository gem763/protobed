That is how it is.\u2019\n\nMo Salah has also never scored a goal against Manchester United in his career\n\nKlopp\u2019s own record away to United is poor though he did gain a draw there in his first season to knock Louis van Gaal\u2019s side out of the Europa League.\n\nLiverpool were beaten 2-1 in the league two seasons ago but gained a point in a goalless draw last season.\n\n\u2018We are getting closer. If there had been a winner it would have been us,\u2019 said the Liverpool boss.\n\n\u2018We have to be ready to try to use the atmosphere there, stay calm in the right moments and pass at the right moments. To do that you have to grow as a team and we have grown as a team.\n\n\u2018When I first came here and we went to Old Trafford it was difficult to face that situation. Nobody expected us to win but now the situation has changed. We expect - whoever we are or wherever we go - a chance to win the game.\n\n\u2018We have to go there and play the best football we can play, with the biggest \u2018balls\u2019, being ready for each challenge, fighting for every ball, all that stuff.\u2019\n\nKlopp said it is surprising that the free-scoring Salah hasn't managed to score against United\n\nKlopp\u2019s biggest selection poser is in midfield with 33-year-old James Milner staking a claim after his rest during the international break.\n\nMilner is reaping the rewards of retiring from England duty and was given a week off from Liverpool\u2019s training ground at Melwood to tick over with a specially-devised training programme.\n\n\u2018The boys not involved on international duty have a week away from Melwood. But they have a proper training plan, but not football work,\u2019 revealed Klopp.\n\n\u2018They have to write every day when they have a session. It makes no sense to have a session with three players and five coaches!\n\n\u2018Having that break (from international football) is the perfect situation for a footballer at that age so Milly was very smart when he made that decision.\n\nKlopp's biggest selection dilemma is whether to include James Milner from the start\n\n\u2018It was a conscious decision for him to think what was needed. He has made a lot of smart decisions in his life and that was just another one. For England everything is OK, and for him and us, it\u2019s all good.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s in Klopp\u2019s nature to relish the big stage and being centre-stage at Old Trafford in front of 76,000 people will take him back to the huge Schalke-Dortmund derbies from his time in Germany.\n\n\u2018Emotionally, there was nothing bigger than that. I don\u2019t compare it (to United-Liverpool), I only know how it feels so it is the same size.\n\n\u2018Maybe in the world, more people watch United against Liverpool but in Germany Dortmund Schalke is a game, everyone has a chance, we watch it because of the emotion and everybody knows about the rivalry.\n\n\u2018I don't have to compare them. I only know how it feels and how it is in a game and how difficult it is of course. Still, you have to find a way to bring your plan on the pitch and make it more likely to win a game more than not and that's what we try.\n\nThe Liverpool boss may look to rely on Milner's experience in a potentially difficult atmosphere\n\n\u2018One of the biggest stories of my career was that the fourth matchday when I came to Dortmund was the derby. We had started quite well in the season, I think, and were 3-0 down at home at half-time.\n\n\u2018Second-half starts, Kevin Kuranyi, striker from Schalke, is in a one-on-one situation with the goalkeeper and if he scores the fourth we are done.\n\n\u2018He didn't, we equalised and we played 3-3. It felt like we won the game and each time Schalke was much better than we were so it was a big mark when people started thinking this team could be something special in future.\n\n\u2018I know what kind of signal a game like this can be so that's why I know what United tries to do.\u2019", "description": "Jurgen Klopp has warned Mo Salah to expect some rough treatment as both men try to break their Manchester United ducks  and make Premier League history.", "authors": ["Joe Bernstein For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/21/19936368-0-image-a-14_1571517257027.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
