They go on to found two start-ups which must go head-to-head with the other at an upcoming national start-up competition.\n\nVideo of APP WAR Trailer\n\nOf course, this is complicated by their developing romantic feelings for each other, but as they are both desperate to win the 100 million Thai baht prize money, Bom and June each send a spy to infiltrate the other's company in a bid to outdo one another.
