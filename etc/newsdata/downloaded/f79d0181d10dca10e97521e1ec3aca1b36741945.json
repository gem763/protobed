Add Interest\n\nThe Duke of Sussex, 35, visited a working de-mining field after spending the night at a de-mining camp funded by Halo Trust, a U.K. charity working with the Angolan government to make the country landmine free by 2025.\n\nPrincess Diana famously visited Angola with Halo Trust in 1997, at the height of the landmine crisis.\n\nHer spotlight, particularly a photograph of her a flak jacket and protective mask while visiting a landmine minefield, turned the clearing of landmines into a humanitarian issue.\n\nTim Graham/Getty Images, FILE\n\nMore than two decades later, local organizations told ABC News they hope Harry's visit to Angola is a \"seismic shift\" like Diana's visit was in showing the world how common and threatening landmines still are.\n\nHarry, the youngest of Diana's two sons, left his wife, Duchess Meghan, and their infant son, Archie, in Cape Town, South Africa, to take this trip to retrace his mom's path in Angola.\n\nIn his first official visit to Huambo, Angola, Harry is being greeted by the same official, Gov. Joana Lina, who was the official host for Princess Diana's visit, according to Buckingham Palace.\n\nHe is visiting the same spot where Diana was photographed, which is now a busy area with schools, houses and businesses, a far cry from the scene his mom saw in 1997.\n\nPrince Harry (MORE: , Meghan's son Archie meets Desmond Tutu in 1st appearance on family's South Africa tour)\n\nHarry will also visit the Huambo Orthopaedic Centre and dedicate it in the name of his mom, who visited in 1997.\n\nAngola is still home to hundreds of thousands of landmines, according to Halo Trust. One man who lost his leg to a landmine in the country in 2002 told ABC News that Harry coming Angola gives him hope.\n\nHarry spoke on Thursday in Botswana about what an attachment he feels to Africa, in part because of his mom's death when he was just 12.\n\n\"I came here in [19]97, 98, straight after my mum died,\" he said. \"It was a nice place to get away from it all, but now I feel deeply connected to this place, and to Africa.\"", "description": "Princess Diana made a memorable visit to Angola in 1997.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/harry-diana-2-gty-er-190926_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
