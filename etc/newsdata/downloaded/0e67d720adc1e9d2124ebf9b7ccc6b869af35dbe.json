(AP) - Fourth-year defensive end Yannick Ngakoue will miss the first game of his NFL career when the Jacksonville Jaguars play at Houston on Sunday.\n\nCoach Doug Marrone ruled Ngakoue out Friday because of a hamstring injury suffered in the opener.\n\nMarrone says: \u201cIt\u2019s a shame. I spoke to him and he really wants to play. He\u2019s like, \u2018I want to play. I don\u2019t really care. I want to get out there.\u2019\u201d Marrone adds that \u201cyou don\u2019t really see that a lot, but that\u2019s how he\u2019s been.\u201d\n\nNgakoue is third in franchise history with 29\u00bd sacks.\n\nLeft tackle Cam Robinson has been cleared to play, but Marrone will hold him out as a precaution. Robinson hyperextended his right knee a few days before the opener. Second-year pro Will Richardson will make his second consecutive start at left tackle.\n\nCornerback A.J. Bouye (hip) and receiver Marqise Lee (knee) are listed as questionable, although Marrone does not expect Bouye to play. Second-year pro Tre Herndon is expected to start in his place.\n\nBackup offensive tackle Cedric Ogbuehi (hamstring) and rookie tight end Josh Oliver (hamstring) also are out for the second straight week.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Fourth-year defensive end Yannick Ngakoue will miss the first game of his NFL career when the Jacksonville Jaguars play at Houston on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
