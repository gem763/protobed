Doctors said at the time that the child would only live for a few hours, however, he is has managed to survive for two weeks now under hospital care.\n\nThe baby's parents, who have submitted their own complaint with the Portugal Prosecutor's Office, claim they were not given any warnings that their unborn child would have any birth defects. His mother told the BBC that she visited Dr. Carvalho for three separate ultrasounds, stating that he raised no concerns during any of them.\n\nShe then had a fourth, more detailed ultrasound at a different clinic, which raised concerns about her child's health. When she told Carvalho about those potential issues, he allegedly dismissed them.\n\n\"He explained that sometimes some parts of the face are not visible... when the baby's face is glued to the belly of the mother,\" the baby's aunt, Joana Simao, told local broadcaster TVI 24, the AFP reported.\n\nThis isn't the first time medical complaints have been raised against Carvalho. The BBC reported that the doctor has at least six complaints currently open against him, dating back as early as 2013. Former patients have also come forward to share their experiences with local media.\n\nOne patient claimed that in 2011 Carvalho failed to warn her of birth defects before her child was born with deformed legs and severe brain damage. The mother said that her child, now eight years old, is still unable to walk.", "description": "A doctor in Portugal has been suspended for six months\u00a0after one of his patient's children was born without eyes or a nose and missing part of its skull.", "authors": ["Dillon Thompson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9uXTo8i3527BD7BBruId8Q--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/5977x3919+2+0/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/7c2a5160-f760-11e9-b7dc-f51751209f40", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
