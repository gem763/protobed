It\u2019s ranged from lawsuits to defamation cases, as we reported earlier this month, and as senior advocate Rebecca John told VICE, this intense backlash has done nothing but \u201ccreate a chilling effect\u201d to intimidate the survivors.\n\nHowever, the last month has seen an escalation of this backlash, and it\u2019s been nothing short of unsettling.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the most recent news. On October 12, an anonymous actor accused film director Luv Ranjan of sexually harassing her back in 2010. The woman, who was auditioning for a role in the Bollywood film Pyaar Ka Punchnama, was 24 when she was told to turn up in \u201ca short skirt and a tight top\u201d for a \u201clook test\u201d. When she did, Ranjan allegedly asked her to strip \u201cto see if she had a suitable bikini body\u201d, following it up with asking her if she uses condoms and masturbates. The woman immediately recused herself and walked out after being finalised (though she chose to drop out later), but managed to speak about her trauma only nine years later.\n\nThe norm in India when it comes to #MeToo has mostly been victim-blaming and shaming. And so it happened with this anonymous actor too, who was discredited by many of her peers in the film industry\u2014incidentally, also the one that kicked off the #MeToo wave in India. However, this time, the backlash from the accused came stronger. Ranjan approached the Delhi High Court and requested for an ex-parte relief to, among other things, hold the right to be forgotten and the right to be left alone, which are inherent aspects of the fundamental right to privacy in India.\n\nConsequently, on October 23, the Delhi High Court restrained Twitter and various media houses from publishing articles and comments about the allegations of sexual harassment against Ranjan. The #MeToo campaign, stated Justice Prateek Jalan at the Delhi HC, cannot become a \u201csullying #Utoo\u201d.\n\n\u201cGiven the potential damage to the plaintiff\u2019s reputation from the aforesaid publication/re-publication in the circumstances\u2026 the balance of convenience is also in favour of an injunction being granted to this extent,\u201d said Justice Jalan. \u201cI am satisfied that the plaintiff would suffer irreparable loss and injury, if further publications of this nature are not injuncted.\u201d\n\nThis order comes very close on the heels of another one involving artist Subodh Gupta, who was accused of sexual misconduct by several anonymous survivors who voiced their experiences on the anonymous Instagram account Scene and Herd (@Herdsceneand), which has outed several men in the art world of India. In the weeks to come, Gupta went on to sue Scene and Herd for civil defamation and demand Rs 5 crore (approx $700,000) in damages. But the single-most concern that arose out of the case was when Delhi HC ordered Facebook to unmask the anonymous people behind the Instagram page. The order was given to the social media giant to provide \u201cthe particulars of the person behind the Instagram account\u201d by November 18 this year.\n\nThe bench had also ordered Google to take down the anonymous posts about Gupta, but last week, Google told the Delhi HC that doing so would \u201chave a chilling effect on freedom of speech and expression and be against public interest\u201d. The resistance also came in the light of the fact that as a search engine, Google can merely index information, and doesn\u2019t own the content that is on independent third-party websites.\n\nHowever, while Instagram still shows the Scene and Herd page at the moment and hasn\u2019t made any official statement about the case, sources have told Huffington Post India that they will be complying with the court orders. \u201cThe company doesn\u2019t have a choice in the matter, it has to follow legal orders. This isn\u2019t something where we\u2019re choosing a side in the matter, this is a legal issue and we can\u2019t just ignore it,\u201d said the source.\n\nSimilar cases have come up in other parts of the world. In the US, a group of anonymous activists aimed at taking down advertising world\u2019s sexual harassers, called Diet Madison Avenue, came under the limelight after Ralph Watson, a chief creative officer of an ad agency, was fired after being outed by the group for sexual harassment. In August last year, he won the right to subpoena Facebook, Instagram and Google to reveal the identity behind Diet Madison Avenue, and seek $20 million-plus in damages. The case is still ongoing.\n\nIn China, a former intern with state-owned news channel, China Central Television, accused high-profile TV presenter Zhu Jun of molesting her in a makeup room in 2014. In August, Jun not only filed a lawsuit against the intern but also her friends who posted the story on Chinese social media app Weibo, and Weibo itself for \u201creputation dispute\u201d. He wants public apologies, for the posts to be deleted as well as $95,000 in compensation. While hers is one of the first to kick off #MeToo in China, it was also heavily censored and repeatedly deleted on Weibo by Weibo itself (even though traces of it can still be found).\n\nNeedless to say that these news updates have come at a very crucial time when this movement is thriving on the power of anonymity that social media provides. The fact that the movement was built upon a viral hashtag that breaks a chronic silence that persists in stories of harassment or assault, means that it needs that platform to survive. It also needs to be understood that the movement came along because, historically, the existing legal machinery in the country have failed the women and their believability when it comes to sexual harassment and assault, especially when a powerful man is involved.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m conscious of the many, many problems with the [existing] sexual harassment act [The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013] and one of them is the power hierarchy. The law has worked well in some situations but in many others, it has failed to provide any redressal,\u201d John had told VICE when #MeToo broke in India last year.\n\nAt the same time, the accused who are slapping the survivors with defamation cases claiming loss of work or reputation are seemingly back in the mainstream. Gupta, for instance, claimed in his lawsuit that \u201call art galleries that once covered and sold\u201d his work have now \u201cactively distanced themselves\u201d from him, and that it\u2019s affecting the sale of his work and livelihood. However, reports show that the artist continues to enjoy patronage from international galleries, galas, fundraisers and auctions.\n\nRight now, social media is on very thin ice when it comes to privacy and content. On October 3, the European Court of Justice stated that different countries can order Facebook to take down content from its platform. The concern, then, by Facebook was that it raises \u201ccritical questions around freedom of expression\u201d. That concern has now become a real danger, especially for the highly contested #MeToo.\n\nThe attack on anonymity is definitely something to watch out for in the weeks, even months, to come. \u201cAnonymity on the internet is a contested issue because people on the other side say it is detached from responsibility,\u201d Apar Gupta, director of the New Delhi-based Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF), told Buzzfeed News in the light of Gupta\u2019s case. \u201cBut in a society which is deeply unequal and has diverse groups that lack social power, the internet offers a chance for them to make statements, revelations, and act as whistleblowers. All this is undermined the moment someone\u2019s real identity is revealed.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is still some hope. Take, for instance, this group of artists, scholars and art professionals signing a petition against Gupta, so that, should Facebook comply with the court\u2019s ruling and the identity of Scene and Herd is revealed, there is still support for the survivors. They see men like Gupta using \u201cstrategic intimidation\u201d to \"make an example of those who had the courage to speak out so that no one builds up that courage again.\" And, perhaps, there lies the real power of the movement: For more allies to join in the chorus and lift the burden from the anonymous survivors.\n\nFollow Pallavi Pundir on Twitter.", "description": "The very purpose and power of social media\u2014anonymity\u2014is under threat, and it remains to be seen how it will damage the global movement.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db170f2c24a6f008da082fd/lede/1571909877343-option2.jpeg?crop=0.9658xw:1xh;0.0146xw,0xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
