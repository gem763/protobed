Within hours of the announcement, YouTube clips began circulating online that showed Mr. Gillis on a podcast of his last year, using offensive language to describe immigrants and mockingly imitating their accents in a rant about New York\u2019s Chinatown neighborhood. In a different podcast episode that also spread online last week, Mr. Gillis referred to several famous comedians with homophobic slurs.\n\nThe online outcry intensified after Mr. Gillis responded on social media, saying that he was pushing boundaries in comedy, and seeming to suggest that critics of his comments were overreacting. \u201cI\u2019m happy to apologize to anyone who\u2019s actually offended by anything I\u2019ve said,\u201d Mr. Gillis wrote in a note posted to Twitter . \u201cMy intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cSNL\u201d Executive Producer Lorne Michaels reacted by firing the comedian before he hit the air, and ahead of the launch of the show\u2019s new season on Sept. 28.\n\n\u201cAfter talking with Shane Gillis, we have decided that he will not be joining SNL,\u201d a spokesperson for the show said Monday in a statement. \u201cWe want \u2018SNL\u2019 to have a variety of voices and points of view within the show, and we hired Shane on the strength of his talent as a comedian and his impressive audition for \u2018SNL.\u2019 We were not aware of his prior remarks that have surfaced over the past few days. The language he used is offensive, hurtful and unacceptable. We are sorry that we did not see these clips earlier, and that our vetting process was not up to our standard.\u201d\n\nThe series recently lost one of its most popular cast members, Leslie Jones, who announced her departure with a warm description of her five-season tenure on the show. \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which has won more Emmy awards than any TV series in history, has seen its ratings seesaw since the consistent highs of its 42nd season, when Alec Baldwin took over the role of impersonating Donald Trump. The show had built anticipation for its coming season with big bookings, including musical guest Taylor Swift and Eddie Murphy, who is scheduled to host the show in December for the first time in 35 years.\n\nMany comedians have been haunted by old material when it surfaces online in new context or under a greater level of scrutiny. Kevin Hart stepped down as the host of the 2019 Academy Awards amid controversy over tweets in which he made homophobic jokes. The debut of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d host Trevor Noah in 2015 was initially clouded by jokes of his on Twitter that riffed on sensitive subjects, including the Holocaust. Such scrutiny has become more frequent, fueling debate about whether comedians should be measured by the same standards of speech that apply to other public figures.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang joined the online discussion about the new \u201cSNL\u201d hire with an offer to discuss it in person with Mr. Gillis. \u201cI prefer comedy that makes people think and doesn\u2019t take cheap shots. But I\u2019m happy to sit down and talk with you if you\u2019d like,\u201d Mr. Yang wrote on Twitter days ago, adding that he didn\u2019t think Mr. Gillis should be fired from \u201cSNL.\u201d\n\nLate Monday, Mr. Yang tweeted that Mr. Gillis had reached out to him and that the two planned to meet.\n\nMr. Gillis sounded a defiant note Monday in a post to Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m a comedian who was funny enough to get SNL. That can\u2019t be taken away,\u201d he wrote, adding that he respected the \u201cSNL\u201d decision and closed with a reference to a Fox comedy series that once competed with \u201cSNL\u201d: \u201cI was always a mad tv guy anyway.\u201d\n\nEven as \u201cSNL\u201d can be edgy with its material, it has been criticized in recent years for being too slow to add more diversity to its cast. The naming of Mr. Gillis as a new featured player came just as the show said staff writer Bowen Yang would become the first Asian cast member in the history of the series, which is entering its 45th season. Chloe Fineman, a former member of improv-comedy troupe the Groundlings, was also announced as a new cast member.\n\nWrite to John Jurgensen at john.jurgensen@wsj.com", "description": "\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d on Monday fired a new cast member slated to start on the NBC show in its fall season, following days of controversy over his use of racial and homophobic slurs.", "authors": ["John Jurgensen", "John.Jurgensen Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107616/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
