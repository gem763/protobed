(Scott Suchman/Ford's Theatre)\n\n\u201cFences\u201d is August Wilson\u2019s most popular play, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s his best. I would argue that other entries in his breathtaking 20th-century canon \u2014 especially \u201cJoe Turner\u2019s Come and Gone\u201d and \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d \u2014 make more penetrating and exciting statements about the palpable and existential aches in African American life.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing some less frequently produced Wilson plays in Washington this season: \u201cJitney\u201d now at Arena Stage and, later there, \u201cSeven Guitars.\u201d But also back on the boards: the historically crowd-pleasing \u201cFences,\u201d in an unsatisfyingly mild revival at Ford\u2019s Theatre. Only three years have passed since a widely heralded film version starring Denzel Washington won an Oscar for Viola Davis, as long-suffering wife Rose. Given the fresh memory of that nearly definitive movie version, this latest stage entry, directed by Timothy Douglas, feels like an anticlimax.\n\nThe broad appeal of \u201cFences\u201d can probably be traced to its pure melodramatic roots; the original 1987 production ran on Broadway for more than a year. This story of a garbageman in 1957 Pittsburgh is anchored to a transparent Oedipal formula and clunky conceits such as a mentally disabled, horn-blowing character named, uh, Gabriel. Its glory is its towering central character, one Troy Maxson, an unbowed oak of a man thwarted by racism and squandered talent and originally played on Broadway by James Earl Jones. Who is, of course, a tower all by himself.\n\n\n\nErika Rose and Justin Weaks bookend Craig Wallace\u2019s Troy in their roles as wife Rose and son Cory. (Scott Suchman/Ford's Theatre)\n\nAt Ford\u2019s, Troy is played by Craig Wallace, an actor of impressive Washington pedigree. But he is an artist of too-refined instinct for this thunderingly earthy titan, who wields his grievances as weapons against Rose (here portrayed by Erika Rose) and son Cory (Justin Weaks). You have to believe in the explosive rage that boils at all times in Troy for the play to hold you for its nearly three hours. But Wallace is an actor of reflection rather than of potential menace. A man who once pulled a knife on a robbery victim and served 15 years in prison and betrayed both his incapacitated brother and his wife? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nAs a result, this \u201cFences\u201d inches along, seeming talky and lackluster. Lauren Helpern has devised a visually striking set, giving us the Maxsons\u2019 modest brick house and backyard in isolation, as if they exist in a universe apart. In a sense, they do: This is the universe in which Troy reigns, and the fence that Rose has him forever building around their property is a metaphor that defines the family\u2019s struggle. No Maxson, it seems, is able to erect any sort of structure that can both confine the others and satisfy their own needs.\n\nWe\u2019ve long waited for Erika Rose, another fine Washington mainstay, to take on a role as big and emotionally expansive as Wilson\u2019s Rose. We eagerly anticipate that bravura scene in Act 2, when Troy confesses his devastating transgression, with all the flesh-and-blood implications of what he\u2019s done, but the rawness of the moment isn\u2019t fully activated. Something essential is held back in Rose\u2019s response, and the cry from the soul we\u2019re expecting fails to be powerfully expressed. The admirably muted qualities of Rose Maxson\u2019s personality are capably revealed; it\u2019s that vital releasing of her equilibrium, and the venting of her anguish, that we don\u2019t experience.\n\nWeaks\u2019s brooding Cory, on the other hand, is a complete portrait of boyhood trying to break free of oppressive parental restraint. He\u2019s terrifically, tightly wound in the play\u2019s predictable dramatic confrontation late in Act 2, when the cornered Troy is challenged by his son. He\u2019s even better in the final scene, after he returns to Pittsburgh as an adult and faces trying to put his bitterness behind him.\n\nDoug Brown, KenYatta Rogers and Jefferson A. Russell provide workmanlike portrayals of Troy\u2019s best friend, Troy\u2019s elder son and the horn-blowing Gabriel, respectively, with Brown doing an especially good job of showing us how the friend, Jim Bono, navigates in Troy\u2019s big shadow. But the dry spells on this evening, unfortunately, tend to reveal some of the holes in Wilson\u2019s \u201cFences.\u201d\n\nFences, by August Wilson. Directed by Timothy Douglas.
