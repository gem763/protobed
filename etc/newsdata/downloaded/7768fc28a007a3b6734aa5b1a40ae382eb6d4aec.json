But I am a troublemaker,\u201d Yin told Motherboard. \u201cI really wanted the Chinese engineers to stand up and speak for ourselves.\u201d\n\nIn late September, Yin, who worked for Facebook's push notifications team, agreed to speak on the record to a local ABC station at a protest over Facebook\u2019s handling of the suicide of Qin Chen, who jumped off the fourth story of an office building at Facebook\u2019s Menlo Park, California campus on September 19.\n\nChen\u2019s suicide raised concerns among Facebook employees and the Chinese community about the working conditions of Silicon Valley tech workers on visas. Since Chen\u2019s suicide, former and current Facebook employees have started posting online about the mistreatment of international workers at the company. Meanwhile, the Chinese community in Silicon Valley responded to the company\u2019s handling of Chen\u2019s death by organizing a protest and memorial for Chen at Facebook\u2019s headquarters on September 26.\n\nA GoFundMe fundraiser called \u201cSay NO To Toxic Work Environment\u201d raised over $6,000 for the events. Since then, a second GoFundMe page has raised over $122,000 for Chen\u2019s wife and child, who are reportedly in the United States on H4 visas.\n\nAt the protest, Yin led a large crowd of employees and non-employees near a giant \u201cthumbs up\u201d sign on the company\u2019s Menlo Park campus, chanting \u201cChinese Lives Matter, Zuckerberg\u201d and \u201cGive Us the Truth Zuckerberg.\u201d Roughly 400 Facebook employees and non-employees attended the protest, according to a Bloomberg report. A video of Yin leading chants went viral in China.\n\n\u201cFacebook was very unhappy with me,\u201d Yin told Motherboard about his decision to speak to the media. \u201cI just thought someone should push the company to give us the truth. We wanted a fair and transparent investigation. We want to know what happened between Mr. Chen and his manager before his suicide.\u201d Yin said he doesn\u2019t have proof, but believes rumors that Chen was bullied by his manager at Facebook and given an unfair performance review.\n\nThe day after the protest, in an email reviewed by Motherboard, a Facebook human resources manager wrote to Yin, referencing his interview with ABC, \u201cTo respect the privacy of the employee and his family please do not discuss the incident with anyone especially outside the company\u201d and suggested that he contact Lyra, the company\u2019s psychological health service. Days later, Yin received a \u201cfinal\u201d warning, which he says did not mention any violations of Facebook rules.\n\nOn October 7, Facebook informed Yin that he had been fired, that he has to pay back a sign-on bonus, and that the company would no longer pay for a trip home to China. \u201cThe team clarified that you will not be receiving a flight home check. Regarding the sign on bonus, we will require that you pay back a prorated portion,\u201d an HR representative wrote. \"I also want to remind you of the obligations that you agreed to when you signed the Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement, which is attached for your reference.\"\n\nFacebook did not respond to a request for comment. Facebook told CNBC that Yin wasn't fired for speaking about Chen's suicide, but the emails reviewed by Motherboard clearly show he was instructed not to speak about the incident.\n\n\u201cThis employee was not fired for joining a protest or talking about the recent tragedy on our campus. He was here for a matter of weeks, and showed poor judgement in a string of policy violations. We won\u2019t stand for our employees intimidating one another,\u201d Facebook told CNBC. \u201cWe won\u2019t get into the specifics of confidential, internal conversations.\u201d\n\n\"I've been formally fired, and return to freedom\"\n\nSince being fired, outrage over Facebook\u2019s treatment of Yin has gone viral in China and among the Chinese diaspora in the United States. A discussion of Yin\u2019s firing on the Chinese site Zhihu has been viewed over 1.6 million times, according to Bloomberg, after discussions of Yin spread to WeChat, China\u2019s most popular messaging app.\n\nEven prior to his firing, in a public post on his LinkedIn account that received more than 10,000 likes, Yin wrote in Mandarin, \u201cAfter participating in the protest, taking a personal interview, and asking the company to announce the truth of the matter, I'm still ok. The pressure is kind of a lot. I received a final warning letter, and plan to display it, add a frame, and hang it on the bedroom wall.\u201d\n\nDays later, he updated the post, adding, \u201cI've been formally fired, and return to freedom.\" Yin, who is originally from Beijing and received his master\u2019s in games and playable media at UC Santa Cruz in 2017, said that he only has two months to find a new job before his visa expires.\n\nSince 2017, as part of his promise to \u201chire American,\u201d the Trump administration has been denying record numbers of H-1B visas\u2014those offered to high skilled workers with bachelor\u2019s and advanced degrees, including many engineers at Facebook, Amazon, and Google. In the three years that Trump has been in office, the denial rate for H-1B visas has risen from 10 to 24 percent. The United States issues roughly 85,000 new H-1B visas each year. In 2018, 651 of those visas were granted to Facebook employees, the seventeenth most of any employer in the country.\n\nYin did not know Chen personally, but said that hearing of Chen\u2019s suicide reminded him of his own story.\n\nBoth were born in mainland China in the 1980s, where they began their careers, then migrated to California to attend graduate school, and had grappled with being migrant tech workers during a period of rising tension between the United States and China, and hostility from the U.S. federal government toward immigrants. What happened to Chen \u201ccould happen to me,\u201d Yin told Motherboard.\n\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide, help is available.
