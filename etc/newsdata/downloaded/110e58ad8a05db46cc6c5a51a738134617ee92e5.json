Applebees has a host!\u201d\n\nKimmel hosted the ceremony in 2012 and 2016 while Colbert hosted in 2017. However, after hosts Michael Che and Colin Jost headlined the Emmys in 2018, the Television Academy decided to push forward with the 2019 broadcast without a host.\n\n\u201cYou know who the real victims are here?\" Colbert asked. \"It\u2019s us. Hosting is the only thing we know how to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but this show sucks,\u201d Kimmel said through fake tears.\n\n\u201cYou would have made a great host,\u201d Colbert said.\n\n\u201cYou would have been even better Stephen.\u201d\n\nEMILIA CLARKE CHANNELS JLO AT EMMY AWARDS, STUNS IN REVEALING GOWN\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d the \u201cLate Show\u201d star joked.\n\nThe two late-night comics joked that without a host, no one would be around to feign interest in \u201cJason Bateman\u2019s vacation stories.\u201d The camera then cut to the \"Ozark\" star who pretended to be visibly upset by the jab.\n\nThe bit ended with Colbert suggesting that if they let the no-host thing slide, Amazon\u2019s Alexa would soon be reading the nominations. With that, the familiar voice of Alexa read both the nominees and winners.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWaller-Bridge took home her second trophy of the night, which was the third overall for \u201cFleabag\" at that point.", "description": "Former Emmy hosts Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert took the stage at the 71st Annual Emmy Awards to mock the Television Academy for its choice to go without a host in 2019.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/ColbertKimmelEmmys1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
