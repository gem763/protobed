This product expansion gives MaxCap, with a 70-30 weighting of local versus overseas investors, a way to appeal further to the large pool of offshore funds that are looking for higher-yielding investments in a time of low returns globally.", "description": "Non-bank lender is stepping up its exposure to higher-risk, higher-reward direct investment in commercial property.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.3244%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_69/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9434488471dc5b8c419cff07dc322fb7ec081883", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
