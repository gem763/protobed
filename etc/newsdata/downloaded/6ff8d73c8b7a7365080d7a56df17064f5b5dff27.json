He affirmed again that he was a journalist.\n\nThe officer repeated his propaganda question, said Watson, who was returning from a reporting trip in Denmark.\n\n\u201cWith his tone, and he\u2019s looking me in the eye \u2014 I very much realized this is not a joke,\u201d Watson told The Washington Post on Friday. Watson said he got his passport back only after agreeing with the \u201cpropaganda\u201d charge.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe incident comes amid rising hostility faced by journalists as the Trump administration continues to attack the media as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nWatson said he had heard a couple stories of similar encounters in the past, but said he did not realize until sharing his experience at the Dulles Airport on social media just how many people in his field were reporting the same brand of harassment. U.S. airport border agents were at the center of several incidents that have raised reporters\u2019 concerns this year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve honestly never had a human attempt to provoke me like this before in my life,\u201d Watson said he told his colleagues. \u201cThis behavior is totally normal now, I guess?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCustoms and Border Protection said in a statement that it is investigating the \u201calleged inappropriate conduct.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hold our employees accountable to our core values of vigilance, integrity and service to country, and do not tolerate inappropriate comments or behavior by our employees,\u201d the agency said.\n\nAD\n\nStandards of conduct for the Department of Homeland Security, CBP\u2019s parent agency, direct staff to \u201cact impartially.\u201d\n\nAn article from Defense One describes Watson\u2019s full recollection of Thursday\u2019s conversation. After the second alleged query by the CBP officer, Watson explained that he covers national security \u201cwith many of the same skills\u201d he used as a public affairs officer in the Army \u2014 and added: \u201cSome would argue that\u2019s propaganda.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhen the officer repeated his question a third time, Watson said, he paused.\n\nHis wife had already circled the airport for 20 minutes. He figured he could get stuck for hours if he tried to call in the officer\u2019s supervisor. So he gave in.\n\n\u201cFor the purposes of expediting this conversation, yes,\u201d he recalled telling the CBP officer.\n\nThe officer made Watson agree one more time before letting him through, Watson said. He says he\u2019s filed a civil rights complaint with DHS.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed and concerned that any U.S. official would question a journalist, or any citizen, in this way,\u201d Kevin Baron, Defense One\u2019s executive editor, wrote to The Post.\n\nOthers in journalism circles and beyond were quick to point out chilling implications in the story.\n\nAD\n\nWalter Shaub, an attorney who served as director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics until 2017, tweeted that the incident should go to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general for review.\n\n\u201cA customs agent withholding the passport of a journalist until he agrees to say he writes \u2018propaganda\u2019 is actionable misconduct, even in Trump\u2019s America,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is something the @DHSOIG should hear about. To file a complaint, @natsecwatson can go here: https://t.co/WaIbRGmsPZ. A customs agent withholding the passport of a journalist until he agrees to say he writes \"propaganda\" is actionable misconduct, even in Trump's America. https://t.co/IQu29gkIl9 \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) October 4, 2019\n\nThis has happened to me coming back into the country too, last year - a pretty aggressive questioning about who I worked for and \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso when you\u2019re not a US citizen (I\u2019m a permanent resident) this takes on a much more threatening tone if they could deny you entry. https://t.co/14C5XUwUht \u2014 Vera Bergengruen (@VeraMBergen) October 4, 2019\n\nA growing list of journalists say they have been startled by government officials\u2019 harassment in a country that prizes freedom of the press. The encounters are raising fears that hostile rhetoric led by President Trump and his allies are damaging reporters\u2019s ability to do their job unhindered.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis spring, the World Press Freedom Index called journalists\u2019 treatment in the United States \u201cproblematic\u201d for the first time in its 17 years of assessments \u2014 and singled out \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s anti-press rhetoric and continuing threats to journalists\u201d as driving the deteriorating conditions. The U.S. ranking on the index has fallen for the past three years.\n\nReport: U.S. declines again in press-freedom index, falls to \u2018problematic\u2019 status\n\nJournalists have had reporting run-ins with border agents for years, too.\n\nIn 2016, a Canadian photographer on his way to cover protests in the United States was detained for more than six hours. Ed Ou said airport officers took away his cellphones after he refused to unlock them, saying he needed to protect his sources. When Ou got the devices back, he suspected tampering and potential data copying.\n\nAD\n\nAs Andrea Peterson reported in The Post:\n\nAD\n\nIf Ou had already been inside the U.S. border, law enforcement officers would have needed a warrant to search his smartphones to comply with a 2014 Supreme Court ruling. But the journalist learned the hard way that the same rules don\u2019t apply at the border, where the government claims the right to search electronic devices without a warrant or any suspicion of wrongdoing.\n\nSeveral other journalists have described difficulties getting through airports in 2019.\n\nIn February, CBP apologized to a BuzzFeed journalist questioned at a New York airport about his news organization\u2019s coverage of Trump and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation. A few months later, a freelancer said he was detained by CBP officials for hours at an airport in Texas.\n\nThen, in August, British journalist James Dyer described an \u201cunsettling experience\u201d as he flew into California to cover a Disney event. The film and TV writer said a CBP officer at Los Angeles International Airport called him a member of the \u201cfake news media\u201d and asked if he\u2019d worked for CNN or MSNBC, two frequent targets of Trump\u2019s criticism.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe aggressively told me that journalists are liars and are attacking their democracy,\u201d Dyer wrote in a viral tweet thread.\n\nAD\n\nHe said he was allowed to move on after explaining that he was just trying to write about Star Wars.\n\nCBP\u2019s response at the time was much like its statement on Thursday\u2019s incident.\n\n\u201cInappropriate comments or behavior are not tolerated, and do not reflect our values of vigilance, integrity and professionalism,\u201d the agency said.\n\nCBP did not address broader concerns about its officers\u2019 treatment of journalists in its Friday statement on the Dulles Airport incident.\n\nRead more:\n\nCNN won\u2019t run two Trump campaign ads, citing \u2018demonstrably false\u2019 claims\n\nPerspective: With impeachment looming, the news media is growing a spine. It needs stiffening.\n\nBritish journalist says CBP agent accused him of \u2018being part of the fake news media\u2019\n\nAD", "description": "The story has sparked alarm about rising hostility to journalists as the Trump administration continues to attack the media as \u201cfake news.\u201d", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZELTpUBYO2k_q5dDMOq7OOsMd_I=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OGFSCEHG3QI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
