The United States, which left the Paris emissions deal in 2017, has said it supports CORSIA with the understanding \u201cthat it is applied by other major aviation states,\u201d a U.S. State Department official said.\n\nChina joined the United States and Europe in 2016 to signal its support for the agreement but publicly cooled on the deal last year, declining to commit to a pilot phase.\n\nA source said at the time China was likely distancing itself as a negotiating tactic.\n\nThe Chinese delegation could not immediately be reached for comment during the assembly\u2019s opening day on Tuesday. But a Chinese delegation representative told the assembly that the country supports some kind of global climate plan for aviation.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Russian delegation declined to comment.\n\nPrivately, China is taking preparatory steps that would allow it to implement the climate deal, which requires most airlines to limit emissions or offset them by buying credits from environmental projects.\n\nIt has asked for its environmental projects to be eligible for purchase by airlines through the program, said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private matter.\n\nWhile China is a major source of emissions now, its relatively recent growth means its cumulative share of emissions is well below that of the United States or Europe.\n\nIndustry says around $40 billion in climate financing will be generated between 2020 and 2035 through the deal.\n\nICAO cannot impose rules, but sets standards for its 193 member countries that are widely followed.", "description": "China has denounced a landmark U.N. deal that caps emissions from international flights, in a setback for an industry eager to placate the growing international movement to curb air travel's impact on the environment.", "authors": ["Allison Martell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
