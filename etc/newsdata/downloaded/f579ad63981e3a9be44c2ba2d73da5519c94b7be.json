The deal is not a one-way street and Iran will act accordingly as we have done so far by gradually downgrading our commitments,\" said Ali Akbar Salehi, director of Iran's nuclear energy agency.\n\n\"Iran will continue to reduce its nuclear commitments as long as the other parties fail to carry out their commitments,\" Salehi said, speaking after meeting the acting head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog (IAEA), Cornel Feruta, in Tehran on Sunday.\n\nFeruta, whose inspectors monitor Tehran's nuclear programme, also met Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif who told him that Iran's breaches were permitted under Paragraph 36 of the nuclear accord, the semi-official Fars news agency reported.\n\nREVERSIBLE STEPS\n\nIranian officials say the paragraph allows one party to the deal to cut its commitments if others do not live up to theirs.\n\nIran says its retreat from terms of the deal is reversible if European signatories manage to restore its access to foreign trade promised under the nuclear deal but blocked by the reimposition of U.S. sanctions.\n\nFeruta reiterated that IAEA inspectors would carry out its verification activities in a \"professional and impartial\" manner, Fars added. The IAEA's 35-nation Board of Governors will discuss Iran at a quarterly meeting that begins on Monday.\n\nSince May, Iran has begun to breach caps on its nuclear capacity set by the deal in retaliation for U.S. pressure on Iran to negotiate restrictions on its ballistic missile programme and support for proxy forces around the Middle East.\n\n\"The actions they have taken are negative but not definitive. They can come back (to full compliance) and the path of dialogue is still open,\" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian said on Sunday.\n\nUpping the ante in its stand-off with Washington, Tehran said on Saturday it was now capable of raising uranium enrichment past the 20% level of fissile purity and had launched advanced centrifuge machines in further breaches of the deal.\n\nIAEA inspectors reported in July that Iran had cranked up enrichment to 4.5% purity, above the 3.7% cap suitable for civilian energy generation set by the 2015 accord.\n\nUnder the deal, Iran is allowed limited research and development on advanced centrifuges, which accelerate the production of fissile material that could, if enriched to the 90% threshold, be used to develop a nuclear bomb.", "description": "UPDATE 2-Iran's nuclear chief: EU has failed to fulfil 2015 deal commitments", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/Brazil-Stock-Market_3_800x533_L_1414427437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
