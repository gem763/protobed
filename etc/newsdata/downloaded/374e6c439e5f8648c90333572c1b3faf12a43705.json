Do you have any idea what that means historically?\" she wrote.\n\n\"It means I redefine everything in culture. Pagan Feast of Winter Solstice? Oh that's now JESUS BIRTHDAY. Pagan Feast of Spring Planting? Oh that\u2019s now EASTER WEEKEND. Pagan Celtic Festival involving dressing up and warding off evil spirits? Oh now it's ALL SAINTS DAY and we celebrate the VICTORIOUS CHURCH THAT HAS BEEN OVERCOME BY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB!!! CANDY PLEASE!!!\"\n\n(Image: SplashNews.com)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nThe model went on: \"I'm not afraid of the world. I'm not afraid of any devil or demon or incantation. They are terrified of me. Halloween is now MY HOLIDAY and I am claiming all candy for the glory of God and the celebration of the Saints.\"\n\nShe added: \"What now? I'll dress up however I like! My favorite characters, pop culture stuff, whatever. It\u2019s my party and you're invited. I'm alive today and a Saint tomorrow. Give me candy.\"\n\nFans reacted with bafflement to Hailey's rant, with one tweeting: \"Ma'am this is a wendy's.\"\n\nAnother joked: \"I too am claiming all candy for the glory of god just fyi.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images for NYFW: The Shows)\n\nAnd a third laughed: \"Me after the priest from Fleabag looked into the camera.\"\n\nHailey has been open about her faith, having met husband Justin through the controversial Hillsong Church , which has faced claims of covering up child abuse cases and been compared to a cult.\n\nIn the Now With Natalie docu-series made by the church this year, Hailey appeared to discuss her religion on camera.\n\n\"I'm here to represent Jesus through me for other people - for his will to be done,\" she told the interviewer.\n\n(Image: Annie Leibovitz/Vogue)\n\n\"I think that the second that we feel like we're too high and mighty, we're always reminded that it's not about us. Nothing is about me, or you, or really anybody. It's about us being a vessel for Jesus to be seen.\"\n\nHailey has also hinted children aren't too far off for the newlyweds, as she replied to comments on her Insta Story.\n\nOne asked her \"Aren't u a Christian?\" when she called for Halloween costume ideas, to which she responded: \"Yes. I still dress up for Halloween.\"\n\nAnd when another follower branded her a \"FAKE CHRISTIAN\", Hailey hit back: \"Our kids are gonna celebrate too :).\"", "description": "Hailey Baldwin defended her decision to celebrate Halloween just weeks after marrying Justin Bieber", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Splashnews.Com", "Instagram", "Getty Images For Nyfw", "The Shows", "Annie Leibovitz Vogue"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13524409.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_John-Elliott-Front-Row-September-2018-New-York-Fashion-Week-The-Shows.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
