Marina Oliphant\n\nThe study, published in the International Journal of Cancer, followed 36,000 men for 13 years, but it did not describe the types of mushrooms eaten nor the mechanism behind the apparent benefit.\n\nIn the past, men have been told coffee has a positive effect, as do cruciferous vegetables, such broccoli.\n\nThey have been advised to eat good fats from cold-water fish, seeds, nuts, olive and other vegetable oil, to help prevent inflammation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBerries and green tea have been recommended because they are packed with antioxidants. One review found men who drank five cups of green tea daily had a lower risk of prostate cancer.\n\nAssociate professor David Smith.\n\nCooked tomatoes were regarded as being very good for prostate cancer but this was revised a couple of years ago.\n\nAssociate professor David Smith, a prostate cancer epidemiologist at Cancer Council NSW, says that measuring lifetime dietary intake is complicated and caution is needed because there are so many possible confounding factors. \u201cWe do recommend, however, that people take their nutrients from fresh foods rather than supplements,\u201d he says.\n\nProfessor Gary Wittert, head of the Discipline of Medicine at The University of Adelaide and director of the Freemasons Foundation Centre for Men's Health, says the best men can do is to eat fresh, unprocessed, real food with lots of herbs and spices, which contain powerful antioxidants. Drinking enough water is important too.\n\nWittert says processed meat is not good for prostate cancer and neither is alcohol.\n\nJill Margo is an adjunct associate professor at the University of NSW, Sydney.", "description": "While there is a lot confusing advice about what men should eat to protect their prostate from cancer, there are a few reliable pointers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/be75128239d24af3aa169858f7c686ec99cf8843", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
