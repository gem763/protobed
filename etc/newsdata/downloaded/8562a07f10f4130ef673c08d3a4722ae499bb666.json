Photo: New York Magazine\n\nIn Robert Evans\u2019s 1994 autobiography The Kid Stays in the Picture, the late Paramount producer recalls a pivotal childhood memory: He\u2019s a teenager, in bed at his parents\u2019 apartment, with Patty Wheeler \u2014 daughter of the famous comedian Bert and, at 18, \u201calready the toast of Broadway.\u201d Suddenly, he writes, their encounter is disrupted by Evans\u2019s family\u2019s housekeeper, who rather inelegantly admonishes young Bobby for hiding out in his bedroom with \u201csome tramp\u201d (who, by the way, doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s a mere 14). Later, his father rewards him for such debauchery with a smack across the face and the lesson sinks in. If Evans \u2014 who\u2019d go on to become the big-shot Hollywood executive behind movies like The Godfather and Chinatown \u2014 wanted to seduce women, he\u2019d have to do it outside the familial home.\n\nSex is a persistent theme in Evans\u2019s book, which New York Magazine reprinted in part in July of \u201994. The excerpt begins with a full-length photo of a topless Evans and his equally topless girlfriend, an apt introduction to a man whose life was a series of decadent, hedonistic affairs \u2014 divorces, a cocaine bust, a murder trial \u2014 punctuated by big professional swings and bigger payoffs \u2014 Rosemary\u2019s Baby, Serpico, The Great Gatsby, Harold and Maude, Marathon Man. \u201cIt ain\u2019t been dull,\u201d he writes, reflecting on his life and career. \u201cYou name \u2019em, I\u2019ve met \u2019em \u2014 well, almost. Either worked with \u2019em, fought with \u2019em, hired \u2019em, fired \u2019em, laughed with \u2019em, cried with \u2019em, figuratively fucked by \u2019em, literally fucked \u2019em. It\u2019s been one hell of a ride.\u201d\n\nIn memory of Evans \u2014 who died on Saturday night at the age of 89 \u2014 we\u2019re republishing the story here:\n\nPhoto: New York Magazine\n\nPhoto: New York Magazine\n\nPhoto: New York Magazine\n\nPhoto: New York Magazine\n\nPhoto: New York Magazine", "description": "Decades before his death at 89, the Paramount Pictures executive Robert Evans published a notorious account of sex, drugs, and politics in Hollywood, called The Kid Stays in the Picture.", "authors": ["Katherine Brooks"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/28/robert-evans/28-robert-evans-the-big-cheese-cover.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
