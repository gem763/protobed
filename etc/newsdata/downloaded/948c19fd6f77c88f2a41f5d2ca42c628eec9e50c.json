They were travelling separately, but recognised one another from the local Muslim community and waved to each other on board.\n\nAn announcer said the plane was delayed, and Mr Abdallah went to the bathroom. When he came out, he said a flight attendant was standing by the door \"like she was eavesdropping\".\n\nShortly afterwards the crew told all passengers that the flight was cancelled and they had to disembark the plane. Mr Alkhawaldeh said he heard one attendant telling a passenger this was for security reasons.\n\nOnce off the plane, the pair said they were approached by a plain-clothes man, uniformed officers and later by an FBI agent.\n\nThis agent took Mr Abdallah into a private room and allegedly asked him his name and about his job, and said his luggage would be searched again.\n\nWhen Mr Abdallah asked what was happening, the agent allegedly said airline staff had called the police and told them they were \"not comfortable flying\" with him. The reason, the agent allegedly said, was that Mr Abdallah \"went to the restroom and... flushed twice\".\n\nAccording to Mr Abdallah, the agent apologised to him and said he could go and catch his rescheduled flight. \"I felt [they were] discriminating against my ethnicity, my religion,\" Mr Abdallah said.\n\nAll the passengers were rebooked on a later flight to Dallas.\n\nWhat did the airline say?\n\n\"We're committed to providing a positive experience to everyone who travels with us,\" the American Airlines statement read.\n\n\"Our team is working with Mesa to review this incident, and we have reached out to Mr Alkhawaldeh and Mr Abdallah to better understand their experience.\"\n\nThe airline has faced accusations of discrimination in the past.\n\nEarlier this year the airline apologised for allegedly telling a female passenger to hide her outfit with a blanket.\n\nAnd in 2017, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a human rights group, warned black flyers that American Airlines \"could subject [travellers to] disrespectful, discriminatory or unsafe conditions\".\n\nYou may also be interested in:", "description": "American Airlines say they stopped the flight over \"concerns raised by a crew member and a passenger\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13481/production/_108877987_tv055861582.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
