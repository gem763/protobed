It must also be acknowledged that officials were only doing their job in attempting to instruct England prop Joe Marler, and others, to move back behind the line. Those players knew exactly what they were doing.\n\nEngland could face fine following their response to New Zealand\u2019s haka Read more\n\nFrom a spectator perspective, though, England added to the theatre without overstepping the boundaries of decency. They made their point, and then backed it up. Their response enhanced pre-match tension and heightened expectation for those at the venue, and those watching around the world.\n\nWhile the All Blacks are adamant England\u2019s actions during the haka had no material impact on the performance or outcome, their alignment immediately signalled intent to meet the three-time world champions head on \u2013 and they did exactly that.\n\nHaka in all forms is often misunderstood or misrepresented globally so it is important to appreciate its many purposes within New Zealand culture. At weddings, funerals, and to mark many other significant occasions and events, haka is often performed as a sign of respect.\n\nIt carries deep meaning throughout New Zealand, with hundreds of schools and towns crafting their own unique versions that embody their people, history and surroundings. This is true for the All Blacks and other New Zealand sports teams, too. Haka is about more than they alone. The ritual allows the team to connect with each other before engaging in brutal physical battles, and sets the challenge for what\u2019s to come in the 80 minutes.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nWhen performed with pride, haka forms a special source of inspiration. Equally, then, why should the opposition be confined in the way they connect in the face of this challenge?\n\nEngland\u2019s response said \u201cchallenge laid down, challenge accepted\u201d. Such a message should be embraced. As long as the opposition do not turn their backs or respond in a way which seeks only to cause offence, teams should be able to react as they see fit, rather than being forced to stand in military fashion behind the line.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest England players look on while New Zealand players perform a haka.

Former England fly-half Stuart Barnes took it too far when he said every team should also have their own pre-game dance, Michael Jackson, or bob shuffle.\n\n\u2018We knew it would rile them\u2019: Mako Vunipola on England\u2019s haka response Read more\n\nHaka is no passing pop song but, rather, a deep-rooted tradition that deserves the upmost respect. It is not, however, beyond the scope of being challenged. In fact, haka is at its best when exactly this occurs.\n\nWhen New Zealand squares off against its Pacific neighbours we see Samoa\u2019s Siva Tau, Tonga\u2019s Sipi Tau and Fiji\u2019s Cibi often performed in unison, in direct opposition, to the haka. The same is true when any number of New Zealand first XV rugby teams clash. Haka plays a major role in these embedded rivalries, with the packed stands performing their challenge alongside players on the pitch.\n\nAtmospheres created by these haka send shivers down the spine. England, clearly, do not share that same indigenous heritage. They and others should, however, be well within their rights to respond as they did in Yokohama.\n\nIt sure beats the lame attempts to drown out the haka with songs, some of which have no connection to the countries in question.", "description": "Eddie Jones\u2019s side added to the theatre of the Rugby World Cup semi-final against the All Blacks without overstepping the boundaries of decency", "authors": ["Liam Napier"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd440c669aad464cc2147f8c47cab47cbf5eafff/0_323_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2884f5108336b0f8d6c595e42eae4b19", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
