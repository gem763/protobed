That is how quickly circumstances can change in this maddening sport.\n\nMatt Fitzpatrick would be well advised to remember that as he departed the Italian Open, bemoaning his one-shot loss. \"Yeah, it was a bit crap,\u201d the Yorkshireman said.\n\nThe 25-year-old had been desperate for his first title of the season, but a final-round 69 was hardly a disaster, despite 15-under coming up one shot short. Fitzpatrick was presented with a 30-footer to enter a play-off, but his effort slipped by.\n\n\u201cThat double-bogey on the ninth was a killer and I\u2019m just disappointed, because the way I played this week was fantastic,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \"To lose by one is obviously very disappointing. I think I've played well when I've been up there on a Sunday, just other people really keep grinding and I keep coming up from behind. It is what it is. It's still a great week, I'm here to win and not here to just make up the numbers.\"", "description": "Just five months ago, Bernd Wiesberger was 378th in the world, worrying about maintaining his status on the European Tour and being described in some quarters as a wasted talent.", "authors": ["James Corrigan", "Golf Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/golf/2019/10/13/TELEMMGLPICT000212928115-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BquHA4qtcp5ppz4ibFW89vjmVgLPAuaxqTtmf6dLCXcrY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
