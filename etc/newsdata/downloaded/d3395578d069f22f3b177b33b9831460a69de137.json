It names Franco, his production company, and business partners Vince Jolivette and Jay Davis as defendants. Insider reached out to Franco and Jolivette's representatives for comment on Thursday, but did not immediately receive a response. We were unable to find contact information for Davis.\n\nFranco is seen with his girlfriend, Isabel Pakzad, at the wrap party for his HBO show \"The Deuce\" on July 21. Splash News\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, obtained by The New York Times, Franco and his business partners \"engaged in widespread inappropriate and sexually charged behavior towards female students by sexualizing their power as a teacher and an employer by dangling the opportunity for roles in their projects.\"\n\nTheir behavior, the lawsuit continues, \"led to an environment of harassment and sexual exploitation both in and out of the class,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nTither-Kaplan and Gaal said they joined Studio 4 in 2014, the year Franco started it.\n\nPart of the draw, they said, was that students would be allowed exclusive rights to audition for roles in Franco's indie films, but it later turned out that the roles were open to other actors.\n\nTuition was $300 a month, but there were additional master classes offered that could cost up to $2,000. One of those master classes was on sex scenes and cost $740.\n\nAccording to the Times, the lawsuit states that students had to audition for the course by recording a video which was then sent to Franco to review. In doing so, they also said that they had to give up their rights to these recordings.\n\nGaal said she auditioned for the course, but was rejected after she expressed her misgivings about it.\n\nRead more: Busy Philipps says James Franco assaulted her while they were filming a scene for 'Freaks and Geeks'\n\nTither-Kaplan said she took the course, which helped her get cast in a few of Franco's films. While filming an orgy scene for one of these movies, she said she witnessed Franco remove the plastic guards used to protect other actresses' vaginas while he simulated oral sex on them.\n\nThe two women are seeking monetary damages and the return or destruction of any videos recorded by students for Studio 4 classes, reported the Times. They also want to open the lawsuit up for other women to join, who also may have had similar experiences.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Franco has been accused of sexual misconduct\n\nThe actor was heavily criticized in 2014, when it was revealed he flirted with a 17-year-old girl on Instagram.\n\nAnd last year, Tither-Kaplan was among a group of women who accused the actor of sexually inappropriate behavior in a story for the Los Angeles Times.\n\nTither-Kaplan told the New York Times that she's taken part in this lawsuit because the first article didn't do much to prompt action.\n\n\"I can't sleep at night knowing that my coming forward, originally, did not do the work that I wanted it to do yet,\" she said. \"There still has been no action, publicly, that shows me that these people know what they did is wrong and harmful and can't been repeated.\"", "description": "Former students Sarah Tither-Kaplan and Toni Gaal said in the lawsuit that Franco and his business partners took advantage of them.", "authors": ["Ashley Collman"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9666a8e94e8657cd2670ea?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
