He came back swinging in the debate and looks fine. But come on \u2014 he\u2019s had a heart attack at the age of 78. What happens if he has another one at any point before the election? Why should a party risk that? He\u2019s also an actual socialist, and he hasn\u2019t entertained \u2014 let alone engaged with \u2014 a new idea in decades. That\u2019s appealing to millennial Marxists who have no memory of the 1970s, but Jeremy Corbyn was also a superstar with the youngsters a while back.\n\nWarren is surging, but she is, I fear \u2014 yes, I\u2019ll say it \u2014 unelectable. I may be wrong, but by pledging to rip everyone off their current private health insurance, it certainly seems like she has thrown away the core advantage of her side \u2014 health security. By floating the notion in the CNN forum that her future Secretary of Education would have to be approved by a transgender 9-year-old boy, she\u2019s placing herself firmly inside a cultural revolution most Americans are deeply uncomfortable with.\n\nAnd the Trump game plan against her writes itself: She\u2019s a supercilious, smug, know-it-all Massachusetts liberal who reveals contempt for the deplorables the way Clinton did last time. The \u201cfirst woman of color\u201d to get hired as a professor at Harvard Law School is the stuff that GOP dreams are made on. That any suspicion of the viability of her candidacy will be ascribed entirely to misogyny will only help Trump, the way it did in 2016.", "description": "", "authors": ["Andrew Sullivan", "Nymag.Com Intelligencer Andrew-Sullivan-The-Difference-Between-Boris-And-Trump.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
