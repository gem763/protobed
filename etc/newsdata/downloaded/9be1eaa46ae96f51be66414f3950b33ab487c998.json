The original piece had sparked calls for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment -- including from some 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nThe two reporters who wrote the story adapted it from an upcoming book, leaving out that several friends of the supposed victim said that she did not recall the sexual assault in question at all. They also did not mention that the victim refused to be interviewed and has made no comment.\n\nNEW YORK TIMES CRITICIZED FROM BOTH SIDES OF AISLE OVER NOW-REVISED KAVANAUGH ALLEGATIONS\n\n\u201cTo leave that central fact -- which is in the reporters' book -- out of the newspaper piece by the same two New York Times reporters is just stunning,\u201d Kurtz said.\n\nThe Times' revision read: \"Editors' Note: An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party.\n\n\"The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.\"\n\nPresident Trump, who nominated Kavanaugh to the high court, had a strong reaction on Sunday morning, tweeting: \u201cBrett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can\u2019t let that happen!\u201d\n\nWASHINGTON POST SAYS IT PASSED ON NEW YORK TIMES\u2019 NOW-REVISED KAVANAUGH STORY\n\nKurtz said he wasn\u2019t sure about the president\u2019s comment on the Department of Justice coming to Kavanaugh\u2019s \u201crescue,\u201d but said a source close to the ustice told him this was \u201c\u2019a disgusting effort to smear Justice Kavanaugh to sell a few books. There is nothing new here.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to Kurtz, the authors had a secondhand source -- Max Stier -- who said that the incident in question happened, but didn\u2019t talk to him. They talked to two unnamed \u201cofficials\u201d who talked to Stier.\n\n\u201cSo, even that part of the account is secondhand,\u201d Kurtz said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that reaches the level to publish a story with a charge of this magnitude.\u201d\n\nKurtz said he believes that the \u201cvery thin allegation\u201d is \u201cin the process of collapsing\u201d but that 2020 Democrats are trying to use the story to gain some advantage.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThey think Kavanaugh\u2019s a good issue for them. But we\u2019re talking here about something that is just not holding up to scrutiny and the New York Times correction today I think is really letting the air out of that,\u201d Kurtz told Hemmer and Smith.\n\n\u201cI think this is pretty black and white. I think it is a trainwreck,\u201d he said.", "description": "A revision\u00a0to a supposed bombshell piece on a new allegation of sexual assault against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was \u201cnothing short of malpractice,\u201d \u201cMediaBuzz\u201d host Howard Kurtz said Monday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Works With Fox News Channel'S", "America'S Newsroom."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/16/694940094001_6086743966001_6086738099001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
