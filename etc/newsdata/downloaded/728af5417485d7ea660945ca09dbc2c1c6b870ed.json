She went towards the exit and picked up two tubs of sweets just before leaving the store.\n\n\u201cShe went into Matalan and selected various items of clothing to a value of \u00a399 and walked out without paying.\n\n\u201cShe then went to Next in the company of Mr Hulme. He went to the underwear section, selected two packets of underwear and left without paying.\n\n\"She was seen in the clothing area selecting goods which she put into a pushchair before leaving the store.\n\n\u201cBoth were arrested nearby. All the items, except one pack of boxer shorts, were recovered.\u201d\n\nThe cash-strapped couple told police they intended to sell the items for money to buy food.\n\nVincent and 41-year-old Hulme, both of Ripon Road, Blurton, pleaded guilty to theft from Next.\n\nVincent admitted two other thefts.\n\n(Image: Stoke Sentinel/BPM Media)\n\nThe court heard the couple were poverty-stricken at the time of the thefts on Wednesday, September 25.\n\nAndrew Turnock, representing Hulme, said: \u201cIt\u2019s likely the boxer shorts that were not recovered were dropped, as they were arrested a short time later and there was no chance to sell them.\n\n\u201cHe had his benefits stopped and quickly ran into arrears with his accommodation. They were going to sell the items to buy food. It was an offence borne out of poverty.\u201d\n\nJoanne Corbett, representing Vincent, added: \u201cThey had not eaten for some time. Miss Vincent had been given a token for a food bank but there was an issue and no food was handed over.\n\n\"Had it not been for the difficulties with their benefits I don\u2019t think we would see her here today.\u201d\n\nThe defendants were handed a 12-month conditional discharge.\n\nHulme must pay \u00a320 compensation for the missing boxers and \u00a3135 court costs, while Vincent must pay a \u00a321 victim surcharge.", "description": "Diane Vincent and Allan Hulme, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, escaped punishment as long as they stay out of trouble for the next year", "authors": ["Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Stoke Sentinel Bpm Media", "Google Streetview"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20664643.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Allan-Hulme-left-and-Diane-Vincent-rightJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
