AAPL, +1.32% became the latest company to come under pressure to take Beijing\u2019s side against anti-government protesters when the Communist Party newspaper People\u2019s Daily said Wednesday the HKmap.live app \u201cfacilitates illegal behavior.\u201d The newspaper asked, \u201cIs Apple guiding Hong Kong thugs?\u201d\n\nThe Hong Kong demonstrations began over a proposed extradition law and expanded to include other grievances and demands for greater democracy.\n\nApple said in a statement HKmap.live was removed because it \u201chas been used to target and ambush police\u201d and \u201cthreaten public safety.\u201d It said that violated local law and Apple guidelines.\n\nHKmap.live allows users to report police locations, use of tear gas and other details that are added to a regularly updated map. Another version is available for smartphones that use the Android operating system.\n\n\u201cWe have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,\u201d said the Apple statement. \u201cThis app violates our guidelines and local laws, and we have removed it from the App Store.\u201d\n\nA Twitter account linked to the app posted a statement denying it endangered police or Hong Kong residents. It said the app collects information from its users and public sources and doesn\u2019t \u201csolicit, promote or encourage criminal activity.\u201d\n\nThe AP was unable to confirm whether the statement was posted by the app\u2019s developers.\n\nIn Hong Kong, users of HK Maps said the application helped them steer clear of police patrols whose riot-control methods and policing during the crisis have been widely decried as heavy-handed, undermining public support for what long was considered one of Asia\u2019s best police forces.\n\nOffice worker Acko Wong, 26, said he downloaded the app to help him avoid \u201cdanger and traffic\u201d during the many protests that have shaken the city.\n\n\u201cIf you know there are many police in that area, and I\u2019m afraid they will arrest me for like wearing a mask or dressing in black or even if I\u2019m young,\u201d he told AP.\n\nHe said the argument that the app could be used to ambush police and could point criminals to areas where police aren\u2019t stationed \u201cdoes not make sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you ambush a group of police with equipment and gear like helmets and shields?\u201d he asked.\n\nApple phone user Canny Ng said Apple\u2019s decision was unacceptable and would make her think twice about buying more of the company\u2019s technology. Although she\u2019d not downloaded the app before it was removed, she has consulted the web-based version of HK Maps that is still live.\n\nWith a 6-month-old baby boy at home, Ng said she has not joined the protests. But the crisis has left her afraid of the police, making HK Maps \u201cquite useful,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI cannot accept what the police are doing right now,\u201d she said.\n\nThat the app even exists \u201cmeans that most of the Hong Kong people, maybe they\u2019re really afraid of the police nowadays,\u201d she said. \u201cEven myself, I just want to find a way that I won\u2019t see any police, especially when I\u2019m wearing black. You\u2019re worried that, oh, maybe they will check your ID.\u201d\n\nActivists complain Beijing and Hong Kong leaders are eroding the autonomy and Western-style civil liberties promised to the former British colony when it returned to China in 1997.\n\nThe criticism of Apple followed government attacks starting last weekend on the National Basketball Association over a comment by the general manager of the Houston Rockets in support of the protesters. China\u2019s state TV has canceled broadcasts of NBA games.\n\nPeople\u2019s Daily warned Apple\u2019s reputation with Chinese consumers might suffer.\n\n\u201cApple needs to think deeply,\u201d the newspaper said.\n\nBrands targeted in the past by Beijing have been subjected to campaigns by the entirely state-controlled press to drive away consumers or to disruptive investigations by tax authorities and other regulators.\n\nChina has long been critical to Apple\u2019s business.\n\nThe mainland is Apple\u2019s second-biggest market after the United States but CEO Tim Cook says it eventually will become No. 1.\n\nApple, headquartered in Cupertino, California, also is an important asset for China.\n\nMost of its iPhones and tablet computers are assembled in Chinese factories that employ hundreds of thousands of people. Chinese vendors supply components for Mac Pro computers that are assembled in Texas.", "description": "Apple removed a smartphone app that allows Hong Kong activists to report police movements from its online store Thursday after an official Chinese newspaper...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT019_apple__ZG_20191010053059.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
