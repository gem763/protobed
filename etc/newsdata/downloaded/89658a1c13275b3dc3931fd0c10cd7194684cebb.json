It\u2019s a time for cool heads and grown-up government.\n\n\u2018Parliament has indicated clearly that it is willing to support this deal. The Prime Minister said he wants a deal. These deadlines \u2013 October 31 \u2013 are meaningless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The key thing now is to get the deal properly scrutinised in Parliament.\n\n\u2018That doesn\u2019t mean delaying it by months, it means giving Parliament a few days, a couple of weeks, to scrutinise the Bill, amend it if necessary and then we can make progress.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nHe added: \u2018The Government should stop making threats, stop throwing tantrums, and get on with the grown-up business of doing its business.\n\n\u2018Just because it can\u2019t get exactly what it wants doesn\u2019t mean it should stop working.\u2019\n\nIf Mr Hammond\u2019s views are shared by the other 20 ex-Conservative MPs who lost or surrendered the party whip over a no-deal Brexit, it would mean the PM\u2019s bid for a pre-Christmas election will almost definitely fail.\n\nMr Hammond resigned from his role as chancellor in July before Mr Johnson took office, warning of the economic risk a no-deal Brexit presented for the nation.\n\nDuring the same explosive interview Mr Hammond also revealed he will stand as an independent candidate at the next general election if the Conservative Party whip is not restored to him before then, explaining he was unprepared to \u2018curry favour\u2019 with the PM in order to run as a Conservative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a poll by Opinium for the Observer, the Tories have opened up a 16-point lead to 40% \u2013 signalling the public\u2019s desire to support the prime minister and end the Brexit deadlock.\n\nAs the Conservative Party breaks away, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour remains at 24% with its leader\u2019s hesitation over the offer of a pre-Christmas election seemingly proving unpopular with voters.\n\nBoris Johnson should stop \u2018throwing tantrums\u2019 Mr Hammond said (Picture: AFP)\n\nIt comes as the Lib Dems and SNP have announced their intention to unite and offer Mr Johnson an election in early December.\n\nThe move could override Labour\u2019s plan to block a December election during a vote on Monday.\n\nMr Johnson needs support from two-thirds of MPs to grant him the election he wants on December 12.\n\nLeaders for the Lib Dems and SNP have said they may support an election, requiring just a simple majority in the Commons, as long as it is held three days before Mr Johnson\u2019s proposed date \u2013 on December 9.\n\nIf the European Union gives the UK a Brexit delay until January 31, as requested in Mr Johnson\u2019s letter to Brussels last week, then the pro-Remain parties are prepared to give the PM the opportunity to have an election on new terms, they said.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
