The NFL could have administered a 14-game suspension -- four for the first violation and 10 for the second -- but the two failed tests will instead be punished by a single six-game suspension.\n\n\"The only competitive advantage I was really looking for was being able to come to camp healthy and having an opportunity to compete,\" Shepherd told Pelissero. \"I'm grateful to the league for showing some understanding, leniency and fairness, and I appreciate them dealing with it in a timely manner.\"\n\nShepherd, who turned 26 on Tuesday, was a third-round pick out of Fort Hays State in 2018. He played in 16 games (five starts) as a rookie, notching 15 tackles (one for loss) and five quarterback hits.\n\nHe will be eligible to return to the team for a Week 9 trip to face the Miami Dolphins.", "description": "New York Jets defensive tackle Nathan Shepherd told NFL Media he took performance-enhancing drugs this off-season, leading to a six-game suspension following two separate failed drug tests.", "authors": ["Field Level Media"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5278339.1568148683!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/shepherd-nathan-181230-1180.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
