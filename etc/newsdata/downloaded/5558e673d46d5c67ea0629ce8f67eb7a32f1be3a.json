A total of 346 people were killed in the crashes, resulting in a worldwide grounding of the jetliner.\n\nForkner said the system was \u201crunning rampant,\u201d claiming \u201cI basically lied to the regulators (unknowningly).\u201d\n\nGustavsson replied, \u201cit wasn\u2019t a lie, no one told us that was the case.\u201d\n\nForkner continues, expressing his dismay at the simulator, calling it \u201cegregious.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nBoth note the extreme pressure to complete the tests for the program.\n\nIn a statement released Friday, House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said he was disturbed by the references from pilots claiming to use \u201cJedi-mind\u201d tricks to certify the plane.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also expressed its disappointment in the messages that were not brought \u201cto our attention immediately upon discovery.\u201d\n\nIn response to the texts, Boeing released a statement saying that \u201c[CEO] Dennis Muilenburg called FAA Administrator Dickson to respond to the concerns raised in his letter. In addition, Mr. Muilenburg assured the Administrator that we are taking every step possible to safely return the MAX to service.\u201d\n\nYesterday, we brought to the attention of the Department of Transportation a document containing statements by a former Boeing employee. Earlier this year, Boeing produced this same document to the appropriate investigating authority. Boeing has also been voluntarily cooperating with the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee\u2019s investigation into the 737 MAX. As part of that cooperation, today we brought that document to the Committee\u2019s attention as well. We will continue to cooperate with the Committee, and all other authorities, as they move forward with their investigations. - Boeing Spokesperson responding to release of text messages\n\nThe company is reportedly wrapping up the final stages of recertifying the plane as early as November.\n\nRead the entire text-message exchange (as they were sent) below, which was released to the House Committee on Transportation:\n\nForkner: dude, log off!\n\nGustavsson: You too!!!\n\nI just logged on to check my schedule.

Or what is the normal chaos there?\n\nForkner: although it must be easy compared to working as a tech pilot for RYR\n\nGustavsson: Well it's different here. We are pretty busy here for sure.\n\nForkner: actually this one is pretty stable, and I signed off some DRs, but there are still some real fundamental issues that they claim they're aware of\n\nGustavsson: What I hated about Ryanair was the extreme pressure they put on people Ok, that's good\n\nForkner: so I just need to start being a d--k to make you quit?\n\nGustavsson: LOL, that's it!\n\nForkner: alright, no more mr nice guy! actually I'd cry uncontrollably if you left\n\nI'd ask for a job in sales where I can just get paid to drink with customers and lie about how awesome our airplanes are\n\nGustavsson: I'd cry if anyone in our group left.\n\nForkner: Oh shocker alerT!\n\nMCAS is now active down to M .2 It's running rampant in the sim on me at least that's what Vince thinks is happening\n\nGustavsson: Oh great, that means we have to update the speed trim descritption in vol 2\n\nForkner: so I basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly)\n\nGustavsson: it wasnt a lie, no one told us that was the case\n\nForkner: I'm levelling off at like 4000 ft, 230 knots and the plane is trimming itself like craxy I'm like, WHAT?\n\nGustavsson: that's what i saw on sim one, but on approach\n\nI think thats wrong\n\nForkner: granted, I suck at flying, but even this was egregious\n\nGustavsson: No, i think we need aero to confirm what its supposed to be doing\n\nForkner: Vince is going to get me some spreadsheet table that shows when it's supposed to kick in. why are we just now hearing about this?\n\nGustavsson: I don't know, the test pilots have kept us out of the loop\n\nIt's really only christine that is trying to work with us, but she has been too busy\n\nForkner: they're all so damn busy, and getting pressure from the program\n\nGustavsson: That is true, I wouldnt want to be them\n\nOk, its time to log off\n\nForkner: ok later man\n\nGustavsson: I'll work from home tomorrow, be online all day later", "description": "The 2016 messages suggest the company may have misled the FAA on the safety of the new plane.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/03/0/0/MAX8FF_K66500-01-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
