His duties as CEO will be taken up by Patrik Frisk, the company's president and chief operating officer. Frisk will officially take up his new position on January 1.\n\n\"Patrik is the right person to serve as Under Armour's next CEO,\" Plank in a statement to the press on Tuesday.\n\nHe continued: \"As my partner during the most transformative chapter in our history, he has been exceptional in his ability to translate our brand's vision into world-class execution by focusing on our long-term strategy and re-engineering our ecosystem through a strategic, operational and cultural transformation.\"\n\nFrisk joined Under Armour in 2017 after serving as CEO of Aldo Group.\n\nHe said in a statement on Tuesday: \"I joined Under Armour to be part of an iconic brand that demonstrated the power of sport and premium experience, when properly harnessed, is capable of unlimited possibilities. Today, I am even more resolute in this conviction.\n\n\"The opportunity that lies ahead of us is incredible. As our entire global team continues to lean hard into our transformation, I am honored to lead this great brand toward the realization of its full potential.\"\n\nUnder Armour has struggled in recent years, its revenue growth dropping from double digits to low single digits even as its main competitors, Nike and Adidas, have flourished and reported strong sales growth.\n\n2018 was particularly troublesome for Under Armour. It not only found itself with $1.3 billion in leftover merchandise, but, in the same year, several of its leading executives, including Plank, were embroiled in a company scandal.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Plank and other executives had accompanied coworkers and athletes on trips to strip clubs that were paid for by the company.\n\nAt the end of 2018, the company announced a turnaround plan and said it would focus more on its women's business and growing its direct-to-consumer business.", "description": "Plank, who founded the company in 1996, will become executive chairman and brand chief.
