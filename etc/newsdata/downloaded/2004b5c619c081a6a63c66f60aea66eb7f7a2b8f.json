(Photo: Sean Gallup, AP)\n\nTwitter on Saturday said it had \u201cremoved or suspended thousands of accounts with ties to governments in the Middle East,\u201d including a former close media adviser to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who reportedly ran a pro-regime online troll army and was implicated as involved in the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, that advisor, Saud el-Qahtani, had 1.3 million followers on the site before he was banned, although his account had mostly gone quiet in the wake of Khashoggi\u2019s murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.\n\nA Twitter blog post said that Qahtani was \u201cpermanently suspended\u201d due to \u201cviolations of our platform manipulation policies\u201d alongside six other accounts that posed as legitimate media outlets but were in fact \u201cengaged in coordinated efforts to amplify messaging that was beneficial to the Saudi government.\u201d\n\nIn the blog post, Twitter also announced that thousands of other accounts had been removed. Those ranged from pro-Chinese government accounts \u201cattempting to sow discord about the protest movement in Hong Kong\u201d and United Arab Emirates/Egypt-based accounts spreading pro-Saudi propaganda and misinformation about the Yemeni Civil War. Others were tied to political parties in Ecuador and Spain. The Times wrote:\n\nIn addition, Twitter suspended a separate network of 267 accounts connected to the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. The accounts were operated by a private company called DotDev, and the information operation focused on Qatar and Iran, according to Twitter. The social media company said it suspended 4,258 inauthentic accounts operating from the U.A.E. that tweeted about subjects like the Yemeni civil war, 259 accounts connected to a political party in Spain and that falsely bolstered public sentiment and 1,019 accounts in Ecuador with links to a local political party that amplified tweets and hashtags about President Len\u00edn Moreno\u2019s administration.\n\nQahtani, alongside former two-star general and architect of Saudi Arabia\u2019s disastrous intervention in Yemen Ahmad al-Assiri, were officially dismissed from the crown prince\u2019s entourage last year as part of a cover-up operation designed to portray Khashoggi\u2019s brutal murder as resulting from the actions of rogue personnel rather than the crown prince\u2019s ongoing, brutal crackdowns on dissent.\n\nTwitter did not comment further when reached by CNN, though Qahtani has also been accused of overseeing the torture of jailed women\u2019s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul.\n\nPrior reporting by the New York Times has hinted at the scale of Qahtani\u2019s online efforts to root out opposition to the totalitarian Saudi monarchy.\n\nIn addition to directing particular ire at Khashoggi before his death, the Times wrote, Saudi officials coordinated with \u201csocial media specialists\u201d via encrypted chat services WhatsApp and Telegram to disseminate \u201clists of people to threaten, insult and intimidate; daily tweet quotas to fill; and pro-government messages to augment.\u201d Additionally, Saudi intelligence services reportedly recruited a mole at Twitter that they directed to \u201cpeer into several user accounts.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the Saudi government has \u201crefused to clarify Qahtani\u2019s legal status,\u201d leading to speculation as to where he is currently located and whether or not he continues to advise the crown prince in a more private capacity. While Saudi prosecutors \u201cdetailed his prominent role in the [Khashoggi] operation,\u201d the Post wrote, he was not one of 11 people actually prosecuted over the murders.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s ongoing intervention to suppress Houthi rebels in Yemen, already tainted with widespread accounts of war crimes, reached another level last week when the rebels launched a massive drone attack on a Saudi oil field and refining facility that reportedly knocked out double-digit percentages of Saudi oil production.\n\nThe Trump administration recently cleared the deployment of a small number of U.S. troops to bolster Saudi air and missile defences in response; Saudi officials vowed to use \u201cnecessary measures\u201d in retaliation, raising wariness about a potential conflict with Iran, which the U.S. and Saudi Arabia claim provided drone technology to the rebels.", "description": "Twitter on Saturday said it had \u201cremoved or suspended thousands of accounts with ties to governments in the Middle East,\u201d including a former close media adviser to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who reportedly ran a pro-regime online troll army and was implicated as involved in the murder of dissident...", "authors": ["Sarah Basford", "Ryan F.
