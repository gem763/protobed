The Gini Index is on a scale of 0 to 1; a score of \u201c0\u2033 indicates perfect equality, while a score of \u201c1\u2033 indicates perfect inequality, where one household has all the income.\n\nSocial Security not enough for some:Either for passion or for money, more seniors keep working\n\nThe increase in income inequality comes as two Democratic presidential candidates, U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, are pitching a \u201cwealth tax\u201d on the nation\u2019s richest citizens as a way to reduce wealth disparities.\n\nThe inequality expansion last year took place at the same time median household income nationwide increased to almost $62,000 last year, the highest ever measured by the American Community Survey. But the 0.8% income increase from 2017 to 2018 was much smaller compared to increases in the previous three years, according to the bureau.\n\nEven though household income increased, it was distributed unevenly, with the wealthiest helped out possibly by a tax cut passed by Congress in 2017, said Hector Sandoval, an economist at the University of Florida.\n\n\u201cIn 2018 the unemployment rate was already low, and the labor market was getting tight, resulting in higher wages. This can explain the increase in the median household income,\u201d Sandoval said. \u201cHowever, the increase in the Gini index shows that the distribution became more unequal. That is, top income earners got even larger increases in their income, and one of the reasons for that might well be the tax cut.\u201d\n\nPersonal finance:2 in 3 Americans are procrastinating on this smart money move\n\nEBay CEO Devin Wenig steps down:Company seeks to sell assets\n\nA big factor in the increase in inequality has to do with two large population groups on either end of the economic spectrum, according to Sean Snaith, an economist at the University of Central Florida.\n\nOn one side, at the peak of their earnings, are baby boomers who are nearing retirement, if they haven\u2019t already retired. On the other side are millennials and Gen Z-ers, who are in the early stages of their work life and have lower salaries, Snaith said.\n\n\u201cI would say probably the biggest factor is demographics,\u201d he said. \u201cA wealth tax isn\u2019t going to fix demographics.\u201d\n\nThe areas with the most income inequality last year were coastal places with large amounts of wealth \u2013 the District of Columbia, New York and Connecticut, as well as areas with great poverty \u2013 Puerto Rico and Louisiana.\n\nUtah, Alaska, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota had the most economic equality.\n\nThree of the states with biggest gains in inequality from 2017 to 2018 were places with large pockets of wealth \u2013 California, Texas and Virginia. But the other six states were primarily in the heartland \u2013 Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, New Hampshire and New Mexico.\n\nA variety of factors were at play, from a slowdown in agricultural trade and manufacturing to wages that haven\u2019t caught up with other forms of income, economists say.\n\nThe best-liked personal computer brand?:Apple, according to this customer satisfaction index\n\nWhile some states have raised the minimum wage, other states like Kansas haven\u2019t. At the same time, the sustained economic growth from the recession a decade ago has enriched people who own stocks, property and other assets, and have sources of income other than wages, said Donna Ginther, an economist at the University of Kansas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a period of sustained economic growth, and there are winners and losers. The winners tend to be at the top,\u201d Ginther said. \u201cEven though we are at full employment, wages really haven\u2019t gone up much in the recovery.\u201d", "description": "Wealthy coastal areas like New York and Washington, D.C., had the most income inequality in 2018, but several heartland states saw big jumps too.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/09/26/USAT/c6d47448-eeae-4205-b927-35c5db87c7ef-AP_Census_Income_Inequality.JPG?crop=5183,2916,x0,y263&width=3200&height=2134&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
