As you may have heard, it is a high-risk, high reward activity. Combined with already volatile crypto assets and highly leveraged positions, it can either make or break your portfolio.\n\nAs a result, you should be extremely careful before you venture into the unknown. The rule of thumb is simple: never margin trade what you can\u2019t afford to lose. But then again, crypto margin trading is one of the quickest ways to double or even triple your portfolio, especially if you know what you\u2019re doing.\n\nIn this guide, we review the best cryptocurrency margin trading exchanges and their key features.\n\nQuick summary\n\nWhat is crypto margin trading?\n\nCryptocurrency margin trading is a way to trade assets using funds provided by a third party. In contrast to traditional trading accounts, margin trading accounts allow you to access more substantial sums to leverage your positions.\n\nStandard position trades are at a leverage of 1:1. However, you can increase the size of your position up to 100 times (only at some exchanges). The result is amplified trades that result either in higher profits or more substantial losses.\n\nMargin trading is especially prevalent in low volatility markets like international Forex, stocks, commodities. Despite that, traders of high volatility markets (like cryptocurrencies) are also keen on it.\n\nA broker typically provides the borrowed funds, but in crypto markets, exchanges incentivize other traders to fund the activity via margin funding. So essentially, your trades are supported by other traders funds.\n\nAs such, crypto margin trading is a hazardous activity. The higher the risks you take, the higher the chances you\u2019re going to be liquidated. Having a proper strategy for entering trades and managing risk (for example, with stop losses) is critical for your financial well-being.\n\nBest Crypto Margin Trading Exchanges of 2019\n\n1. BitMEX\n\nLaunched in 2014, BitMEX is the most prominent name in the industry when it comes to crypto margin trading.
