Can the radical Democrat win it in 2020?\n\nSanders nearly took Iowa in 2016. Can the radical Democrat win it in 2020?\n\nBernie was back but this time Margaret Rebik was in two minds.\n\nIn 2016, the retired slaughterhouse worker\u2019s vote helped deliver Marshall county for Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton in the Iowa caucuses. Sanders very nearly won the state.\n\nBut now, as she watched Sanders relaunch his campaign in Iowa following his heart attack earlier this month, Rebik said she was also eyeing Elizabeth Warren.\n\nSocialism used to be a dirty word. Is America now ready to embrace it? Read more\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real toss-up,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really is. I met Bernie a long time ago before he even ran, at a private dinner in Iowa City. I remember listening to him speaking and thinking, \u2018What he says is what he really wants to do.\u2019 He\u2019s been saying the same thing for years. He don\u2019t change. Anybody that believes in the same thing for so many years is true.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve been checking out the other guys too, listening to them talk and all. I don\u2019t really see any difference with Warren. I like her too.\u201d\n\nRebik is a little embarrassed to admit it \u2013 her daughter works for the Sanders campaign in Iowa.\n\nThis is the challenge for the Democrat\u2019s most radical candidate with the caucuses just four months away. Sanders needs to win Iowa to position himself as the defining alternative to the national frontrunner, the former vice-president Joe Biden, as the primary unrolls. But now he not only has to allay concerns about his health and age, but must stave off those regarded as interlopers by his most loyal supporters.\n\nDefined against a single establishment candidate in Clinton, Sanders came within a whisker of beating her in Iowa, firing up his campaign.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Margaret Rebik voted for Sanders in 2016, but she is unsure who she\u2019ll vote for now. Photograph: Chris McGreal/The Guardian\n\nA poll for the Des Moines Register last month showed that now distinctions with other candidates are not so stark, and with new concerns about his age and health, some Sanders supporters are bleeding away.\n\nIn Iowa, nearly a third of those who caucused for him in 2016 say they will back Warren. About 12% will vote for Pete Buttigieg. The poll put Warren in first place among likely caucus voters, ahead of Biden with Sanders slumping to third.\n\nStill, the same poll showed Sanders supporters are far more enthusiastic about their man than Warren\u2019s backers are about her, suggesting that at least some can be won back.\n\nAt a post-heart attack comeback rally in Marshalltown, the first stop on an \u201cend corporate greed\u201d tour, there was bafflement that anyone looking for a progressive candidate would not stick with the man who has set much of the agenda.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the only candidate who\u2019s been fighting for us consistently his entire career. I feel I can trust him,\u201d said Thomas Thurston, a 33-year-old landscape designer.\n\nThurston struggled to explain why Sanders has fallen in the polls, other than to question the polls themselves and to say the senator is up against a hostile media.\n\nSanders reminded his audience that the policies he espoused in 2016 were regarded as \u201cradical and extreme\u201d. Now they are at the heart of the race and his rivals have embraced many in some form, particularly in widening access to public health insurance through the federal Medicare programme. Biden and Warren want a single public insurance system. Others propose it as an option alongside private schemes.\n\nBut Warren has prevaricated over some of its workings, reinforcing doubts that she is as committed as Sanders.\n\nHe\u2019s the only candidate who\u2019s been fighting for us consistently his entire career. I feel I can trust him Thomas Thurston\n\nHealthcare reform is important to Thurston and his wife, Kelly, an estate agent, because they are self-employed and say they pay high insurance premiums.\n\n\u201cWarren isn\u2019t as clear about it as he is. I trust Sanders,\u201d said Thurston.\n\nPat Copley, a 72-year-old former hospital ward clerk who is unflinching in her support for Sanders, said she was drawn to him by his healthcare reforms. But she is uncertain about how the issue plays in small-town Iowa.\n\nOn the one hand, private insurance premiums have surged while small hospitals have been closing across the midwest. On the other, she is frustrated that those with good and affordable insurance, particularly labour union members, are fearful of a government-run programme paid for through taxation.\n\n\u201cI know retired union people who are fearful and I don\u2019t know what he can say to change their minds,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fears about healthcare. They\u2019re false.\u201d\n\n\u2018Still shopping around\u2019\n\nSanders still has several advantages. Endorsements by two members of \u201cthe Squad\u201d, representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, shored up his bona fides as the original radical in the race. He also has the largest election chest filled from small donations by individual supporters and an activist base far more organised and energised than many of his rivals.\n\nSanders has sought to diminish concerns about his health by casting his age as experience. Still, Copley worries that his heart attack has potential supporters looking elsewhere.\n\n\u201cI hear that talk in Iowa,\u201d she said. \u201cMy 78-year-old friend doesn\u2019t want to vote for him because he\u2019s too old. I\u2019m going to continue to vote for him because he speaks to me. It may be pie in the sky but I\u2019m going to follow him,.\u201d\n\nFor Alex Abbe, a 32-year-old high school teacher, it is a major issue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still shopping around. Honestly, the age and the heart attack concerns me. I don\u2019t plan on caucusing for Bernie,\u201d he said, even though he turned out to see Sanders speak.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bernie Sanders shakes hands with supporters during a campaign rally at the Iowa state fairgrounds in Des Moines. Photograph: Scott Morgan/Reuters\n\n\u201cI\u2019m attracted to someone who brings energy. I don\u2019t get that with Biden. Elizabeth Warren I do. I\u2019m one of those voters who like the more progressive plans of some of the candidates. But then on the flip side, you\u2019ve got to ask yourself, are those achievable things? I don\u2019t know what route I\u2019m going to go down.\u201d\n\nThe downturn in Sanders\u2019 political fortunes has some of his most ardent supporters pondering what to do if he doesn\u2019t win the nomination. Some refused to vote for Clinton last time. Copley did, reluctantly.\n\n\u201cI felt like I had a gun to my head. I don\u2019t know if I can do it again, vote for any old liberal. It would be very hard to vote for Biden. I would not have any regrets voting for Warren. I just hope she wouldn\u2019t turn out to be like Obama. I thought he was going to be a lot more progressive than he turned out being. He did a lot of things I thought were horrid. But Sanders I trust.\u201d\n\nThe Thurstons are also conflicted. Both refused to vote for Clinton in 2016. Kelly wrote in Sanders on the ballot paper. Thomas voted for the Green candidate, Jill Stein.\n\nThis time Kelly said removing Donald Trump is the priority. Thomas said he \u201cprobably\u201d will vote for the Democrat.\n\n\u201cDepends on which one,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all more progressive now because of Bernie. The options have gotten better. Whether they\u2019re really being true to their word or not we\u2019ll find out.\u201d", "description": "He needs the state to position himself as the defining alternative to frontrunner Biden.
