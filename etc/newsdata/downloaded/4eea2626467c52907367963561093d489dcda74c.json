Security Council, according to local news outlet Radio Farda.\n\nIran said it would take a fourth action away from the program if Europe doesn\u2019t take steps to protect Iran from U.S. sanctions. The Trump administration has refused to remove sanctions before talks with Iran.\n\nFrom the time Tehran agreed to the nuclear deal, Mousavi argued, \u201cIran has been allowed to take retaliatory measures under Articles 26 and 36 of the JCPOA in case the other parties contravene the JCPOA.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Mousavi continued, \u201cIt would be a ridiculous and wrong measure for them (Europeans) to retaliate in response to our retaliatory measures, and we advise them not to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201c(Snap-back sanctions are) dead and from the legal standpoint, there is no possibility of Europe using the snap-back mechanism,\u201d Mousavi said.\n\nThe U.S., France, Britain, China, Russia and Germany originally negotiated the JCPOA in 2015 under the Obama administration.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been a long critic of the deal, claiming that it was not comprehensive enough and only delayed Iran from making a nuclear weapon.\n\nFrom the very beginning of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in 2015, the candidate called the deal an \u201coutrage\u201d and the product of \u201cgross incompetence\u201d on the part of the Obama administration.\n\nIn February 2016, Trump ranked ending the Iran deal as his \u201cnumber one priority\u201d in a speech to the American-Israeli Political Affairs Committee (AIPAC).\n\nThe U.S. ended the agreement in May last year.\n\nUPI contributed to this report", "description": "An E.U. warning it would withdraw from the Obama-negotiated 2015 nuclear deal has been branded \"illegal\" by Tehran.", "authors": ["Simon Kent"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/10/iran-EU.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
