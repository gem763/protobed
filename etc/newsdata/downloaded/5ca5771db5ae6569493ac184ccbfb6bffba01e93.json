Veuer\u2019s Natasha Abellard has the story. Buzz60\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 \"Sesame Street\" is taking a new step to try to help kids navigate life in America \u2014 it's tackling the opioid crisis.\n\nSesame Workshop is exploring the backstory of Karli, a bright green, yellow-haired friend of Elmo's whose mother is battling addiction. The initiative is part of the Sesame Street in Communities resources available online.\n\n\"Sesame Street\" creators said they turned to the issue of addiction since data show 5.7 million children under age 11 live in households with a parent with substance use disorder.\n\n\"There's nothing else out there that addresses substance abuse for young, young kids from their perspective,\" said Kama Einhorn, a senior content manager with Sesame Workshop. It's also a chance to model to adults a way to explain what they're going through to kids and to offer simple strategies to cope.\n\n\"Even a parent at their most vulnerable \u2014 at the worst of their struggle \u2014 can take one thing away when they watch it with their kids, then that serves the purpose,\" Einhorn said.\n\n\"Sesame Street\" character Karli and 10-year-old Salia Woodbury talk about having parents who are in recovery.

I'm here with my friend Salia. Both of our parents have had the same problem \u2014 addiction,\" Karli told the camera.\n\n\"My mom and dad told me that addiction is a sickness,\" Salia said.\n\n\"Yeah, a sickness that makes people feel like they have to take drugs or drink alcohol to feel OK. My mom was having a hard time with addiction and I felt like my family was the only one going through it. But now I've met so many other kids like us. It makes me feel like we're not alone,\" the puppet continued.\n\n\"Right, we're not alone,\" Salia responded. \"And it's OK to open up to people about our feelings.\"\n\nMore: U.S. deaths from alcohol, drugs and suicide hit highest level since record-keeping began\n\nProduction members clap for Salia Woodbury, 10, from Irvine, Calif., on the set with \"Sesame Street\" muppet Karli and puppeteer Haley Jenkins during an Aug. 6, 2019, taping about parental addiction. Sesame Workshop is addressing the issue of addiction. Data show 5.7 million children under 11 live in households with a parent with substance use disorder. Salia's parents are in recovery after struggling with addiction, and she shares her experience with the show's Karli\u2014whose muppet character has a mom who is also in recovery. (Photo: Bebeto Matthews, AP)\n\nIn the segment, Karli and Salia each hold up hand-drawn pictures of flowers, with multiple petals representing \"big feelings\" \u2014 like anger, sadness and happiness. They offer ways to feel better, including art and breathing exercises.\n\nThe segment leans on carefully considered language. Creators prefer \"addiction\" to \"substance abuse\" and \"recovery\" to \"sobriety\" because those terms are clearer to children. Despite the subject, the mood was light in the room, largely thanks to Jenkins' calm and empathic manner.\n\n\"I know it feels awkward because people don't normally have conversations standing shoulder-to-shoulder,\" she told Salia between takes. \"This is weird, but trust me, it looks good.\"\n\nKarli had already been introduced as a puppet in foster care earlier this year but viewers now will understand why her mother had to go away for a while. The introduction of her back story follows other attempts by entertainment companies to explore the issues of addiction, including \"The Connors\" on ABC and \"Euphoria\" on HBO.\n\nThe online-only segments with Karli and Salia are augmented with ones that feature Elmo's dad, Louie, explaining that addiction is a sickness, and Karli telling Elmo and Chris about her mom's special adult meetings and her own kids' ones.\n\nPuppeteers Haley Jenkins, left, and Leslie Carrara-Rudolph perform with their \"Sesame Street\" muppets Karli and Abby Cadabby, respectively, for segments about parental addiction. (Photo: Bebeto Matthews, AP)\n\nKarli also opens up about her family to Abby Cadabby in another segment, and Karli tells Elmo about how she mistakenly used to feel like her mom's addiction was her fault. Karli, Elmo, Rosita and Abby Cadabby also sing \"We're Special and So Are You.\" Viewers are referred to free online resources in both English and Spanish that include videos, storybooks, digital interactives and games.\n\nChildren's therapist Jerry Moe, the national director of the Hazelden Betty Ford Children's Program, helped craft the segments and resources, saying he was grateful to help since there's been a paucity of resources for the preschool age-group.\n\n\"These boys and girls are the first to get hurt and, unfortunately, the last to get help,\" he said. \"For them to see Karli and learn that it's not their fault and this stuff is hard to talk about and it's OK to have these feelings, that's important. And that there's hope.\"\n\n\"Sesame Street,\" which began airing in 1969, has a long history of tackling topical issues in a way approachable to children. It's had puppets with HIV, jailed parents and autism, explored homelessness, women's rights and even girls singing about loving their hair.\n\n\"For everything we've done \u2014 from military families to homelessness \u2014 it's all about how to make children free to talk and to give parents the tools to do just that. They tend to avoid it and it's what they need more than anything,\" said Sherrie Westin, president of global impact and philanthropy for Sesame Workshop.\n\nJaana and Sam Woodbury, from Irvine, Calif., and their daughters Salia, 10, right, and Kya, 6, with \"Sesame Street\" muppet Karli and puppeteer Haley Jenkins in New York.

(Photo: Bebeto Matthews, AP)\n\nSalia's parents \u2014 Sam and Jaana Woodbury, who are raising four girls in Orange County, California \u2014 said they welcomed the show's attention on opioid and alcohol addiction. They've been in recovery for about eight years.\n\n\"When I was going through addiction, I felt extremely alone and isolated. I didn't have any connection to the outside world,\" said Jaana Woodbury. \"I think it's amazing that 'Sesame Street' is using their platform to share resources to help other women and fathers.\"\n\nAt the end of the taped segment with Karli and Salia, the puppet turns to the girl. \"I'm so glad we're friends, Salia,\" Karli said.\n\n\"Me, too, Karli,\" Salia responds.\n\n\"Can I have a hug?\" Karli asks.\n\n\"OK,\" says her friend.\n\nAnd they do.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/10/sesame-street-tackles-addiction-crisis-way-kids-can-understand/3926530002/", "description": "\"Sesame Street\" is taking a new step to help kids navigate life: It's tackling the opioid crisis with Muppet Karli and a 10-year-old California girl.", "authors": ["Mark Kennedy", "Associated Press", "Published A.M.
