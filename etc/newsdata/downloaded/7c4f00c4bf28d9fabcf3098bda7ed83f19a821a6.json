His conclusion was that Russia has decided that it doesn't care if its agents are unmasked.\n\nA similar situation occurred in the 2018 attempted killing of double agent Sergei Skripal in the UK.\n\nThere are clear signs that \"Sokolov\" was traveling on fake papers that could have only been issued by the Russian state, experts on the country's security operations have said.\n\nInvestigators from the open-source investigations group Bellingcat published a joint project with Russian outlet The Insider (which has no relation to this publication, Insider), and Der Spiegel in Germany. It centered on tracking the passport found on the suspect at the time of the murder.\n\nThey say that they used a variety of leaked databases from inside Russia, as well as with the cooperation of sources with access to official Russian government registrations.\n\nDetails on \"Sokolov\" pointed to the Russian security services having issued the passport in his possession as a way to hide his identity, the researchers said.\n\nThe investigators say that \"the assassin travelled to Berlin via France under a validly issued, non-biometric Russian passport in the name of Vadim Andreevich Sokolov, born in August 1970.\"\n\nHowever, the identity did not withstand scrutiny.\n\nThe Bellingcat story said: \"Despite the fact that he used a legitimate passport, we have determined that no such person exists in Russia's sprawling, comprehensive national citizen database.\"\n\n\"In addition, no trace of such a person exists in a trove of hundreds of leaked residential databases, previously obtained and aggregated by Bellingcat.\"\n\nThey concluded that: \"This discovery makes Russia's claims that the killer is not connected to the Russian state implausible, as no person in Russia is in a position to obtain a valid Russian passport under a fake identity without the involvement of the state bureaucratic and security apparatus.\"\n\nA familiar playbook\n\nSuch an approach has been used with Russia-linked killings in the past. The most recent was when two suspected Russian agents were accused of using nerve poison to try to kill Skripal, the defected spy, and his daughter last year in Salisbury, England.\n\nA source with a background in Israeli intelligence told Insider that the advent of vast online databases mean that even secret services struggle to make convincing false identities for agents.\n\nThe source - a former undercover intelligence agent who now works as a contractor for the Israeli government -spoke on condition of anonymity due to his past work in intelligence.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"These blunders will continue because, with the linking of national databases as well as the use of both biometric data embedded in passports as well as the constant scanning and storing of images in facial recognition software, it's basically impossible to just issue someone a new identity as we did in the recent past.\"\n\n\"All the great technical tricks we can use to track our enemies and targets are no longer the province of states.\"\n\n\"All those same things are often commercially or openly available to anyone and thus very effective at identifying intelligence teams operating abroad.\"\n\nThe source said that even in the past few years the process of establishing covers for intelligence operators has become significantly harder.\n\nFormer tactics focused on finding operatives with secondary passports from Western countries like Canada and Australia, he said.\n\nHe continued: \"We used to recruit someone and train them then we could establish a proper cover for them, get them a Canadian passport from someone in the Israeli diaspora and then forge a bunch of visa stamps to 'season' the cover so that it looked legit.\"\n\n'Bulls--t passports will not hold up to scrutiny'\n\n\"Now none of those skills - forging, human intelligence, networking - can make up for the facial scans of people traveling through airports, or that, for a passport to truly be a legitimate cover and travel document it has to be more than good looking, it has to be properly linked to all the right databases.\"\n\nBut even then, said the source, the passport won't hold up if the host nation decides to truly scrutinize the documents, pointing to a 2010 assassination of a Hamas financier in a Dubai hotel room.\n\n\"That team got into Dubai, tracked and eliminated the target and left the country... no problem,\" he said. \"But the second the police realized what happened and began to investigate, all of the team members' covers completely collapsed.\n\n\"We were lucky they'd left because, in the modern networked environment, bulls--t passports will not hold up to scrutiny.\"\n\nBut what concerns the Israelis, in terms of international opinion, doesn't seem to bother Russia.\n\nIn 2006, Russia made its policy clear when it legalized killing internal enemies who fled the country.\n\nShortly after the new law was approved, suspected Russian agents killed former agent, Alexander Litvinenko, with a lethal dose of radioactive material.\n\nSince Litvinenko's murder in 2006, hits against Russia's former and current enemies have taken place at a steady clip - and show no sign of slowing.", "description": "Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a former militant active against Russia, was shot dead in Berlin in mid-August.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9325/c21695b3f5c64084b4e6328b7ba0f653.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
