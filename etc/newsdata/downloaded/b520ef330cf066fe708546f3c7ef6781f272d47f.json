Unlike England, Scotland and Wales, laws in Northern Ireland forbid abortion, except where a mother's life is at risk, bans that have been upheld by the region's conservative politicians.\n\nA power-sharing executive between Northern Ireland and Britain collapsed almost three years ago and the assembly remains suspended, with Northern Ireland currently largely administered from London.\n\nIn July, lawmakers in London voted overwhelmingly to compel the government to overhaul the laws if Belfast's devolved executive was not restored by midnight on Oct. 21.\n\nNo new devolved government was formed Monday night, meaning abortion will be decriminalized. The law changes will also begin consultation on what a framework for abortion services should look like, due to be finalized and approved by March 2020.\n\n\"We are not going to stick with the guilt and the shame any longer. Tomorrow the law changes in this place, and for the first time in Northern Ireland, women will be free,\" pro-choice campaigner Dawn Purvis told a public meeting in Belfast on Monday.\n\n\"Free to choose if, when and how many children they will have in the care of health-care professionals. This is a very emotional day for many here.\"\n\nAn anti-abortion activist demonstrates outside the Parliament Buildings as a number of lawmakers return to attend the special sitting on Monday.

Members of our community are that little bit more equal in our society. We have not asked for more rights, but the same rights as everyone else,\" said activist Shane Sweeney.\n\nIt will take the British parliament until mid-January to bring in the new legislation, setting up Feb. 14 as the first opportunity for same-sex couples to marry once they give the required 28 days' notice.", "description": "Campaigners who fought for decades to end Northern Ireland's same-sex marriage ban and restrictions on abortion gathered in Belfast on Monday to prepare for a momentous change to the laws at the stroke of midnight.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5330142.1571739163!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1177312765.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
