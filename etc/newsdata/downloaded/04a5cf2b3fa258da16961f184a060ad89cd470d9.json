I think people are saying \u2018here we go again\u2019. It\u2019s not going to influence me. I can\u2019t influence that. The only thing I can influence \u2026hopefully we can play better than we did last Saturday.\n\nNewcastle were poor last time out at home to Brighton. The hosts held on for a point and lie just one place above the relegation zone Credit: Getty Images\n\n\u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine with it. It\u2019s fair to say Lee Charnley runs the club on a day-to-day basis. We have regular contact. That\u2019s every day, twice a day. That\u2019s the way it was going to be. That\u2019s the way it is. I\u2019m fine with it. The club\u2019s run fantastically well through Lee. That\u2019s who I speak with.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nBruce also denied that it will have any impact on the players, adding: \u201cAll the players are professionals. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve heard it all before. If they\u2019ve been here with Jamaal [Lascelles], they\u2019ve probably seen it how many times? Five? Six? Twice a season for the last five years? It\u2019s common knowledge the club\u2019s for sale.\n\n\u201cUntil I\u2019m told otherwise, [Mike Ashley remains as owner]. I\u2019ve been involved in it before at Aston Villa. I\u2019ve been involved in a takeover at Birmingham City. If it\u2019s true, then I get involved. It\u2019s something I can\u2019t influence.\u201d\n\nCharnley has also not spoken to Bruce with the unofficial line coming out of the boardroom that Newcastle intend to ignore the matter given the lack of a credible offer.", "description": "Steve Bruce has poured scorn on the latest talk of a Newcastle United takeover and claimed he will not even seek clarification from managing director Lee Charnley to see if it is real.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wdrigdTNDWhoEkYxRMu.bw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03OTguOTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/G5fcxuMcba9F_lgxsqAh_A--~B/aD04MDU7dz0xMjg5O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/55d6fc653af3ddf76850477e3beef7bc", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
