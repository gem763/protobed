(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nCarol Anderson is the Charles Howard Candler professor of African American studies at Emory University and author of \" White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide \" and \"One Person, No Vote: How Voter Suppression is Destroying Our Democracy.\"\n\nPresident Trump has called the impeachment inquiry facing him \u201cbullshit\u201d and tweeted furiously that it is nothing less than a coup. He has even warned of a civil war. These claims are as incendiary as his demonization of immigrants, his barely veiled anti-Semitism and his embrace by and of white supremacists, all of which have already led to violence, hate crimes and slaughter.\n\nThat is the threat he holds over our heads: to \u201ctear our country apart\u201d if Congress holds him accountable, a threat militia groups, including those with ties to white power organizing, are taking seriously. Yet if we bow down to his threats, it will once again be the United States capitulating to extortion, something made possible by Trump\u2019s commitment to a raft of racist policies he promises his base in return for unchecked power.\n\nWhen it comes to a nation held hostage to racism, we have been here before.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, the British occupied New York City, ran George Washington\u2019s Continental Army nearly ragged and went in for the kill as they attacked the rebellion\u2019s soft underbelly \u2014 the South. Georgia and South Carolina were not ready for the onslaught. They simply could not find enough white men willing to take up arms to fend off the oncoming assault on Charleston and Savannah. As the British got closer and closer to Charleston, the Continental Congress rushed a representative to South Carolina with a plan. There were men available, the representative from Congress pleaded, they just were not white. It was time, he said, to arm the enslaved.\n\nThe South Carolina government recoiled in \u201chorror\u201d at the suggestion. This war for liberty did not and could not include those of African descent.\n\nDespite the looming peril, South Carolina\u2019s answer to the Continental Congress was simple: It would rather surrender to the British than arm the enslaved. These southern colonists would rather die for white supremacy than live in a nation where the revolutionary language of equality could become the actual reality.\n\nThe same choice of white supremacy versus a nation committed to democracy and equality threatened to derail the Constitutional Convention in 1787. The Articles of Confederation had exposed the economic and political incoherence of the new nation. With individual states printing their own money and making foreign policy independent of the federal government \u2014 often blindsiding it with their actions \u2014 the European powers were eagerly exploiting the United States\u2019 weaknesses and were poised to pick clean the bones of a nation that seemed to be dying before it even really began.\n\nThe Constitutional Convention was to be the antidote to that systemic illness by creating a governing structure that would be coherent enough to thrive and strong enough to fend off the nation\u2019s enemies.\n\nSouth Carolina and Georgia, however, had other plans and held a weakened nation\u2019s very survival hostage to their priority: slavery. Their representatives threatened to walk away from the convention if a series of measures, from the three-fifths clause to the Fugitive Slave provision to a continuation of the Atlantic slave trade for another 20 years, were not embedded in the nation\u2019s founding document.\n\nThey won, and the nation lost.\n\nBy emboldening and strengthening slavery, the Constitution allowed white supremacy to trump the nation\u2019s founding ideas. The Faustian deal cut in 1787, though, could not ensure national unity.\n\nThe South\u2019s insistence on spreading slavery throughout the increasing territorial breadth of the United States, which was land that had been seized from the indigenous people and redistributed to whites, eventually proved to be too much. When Abraham Lincoln was elected to the presidency on a platform explicitly opposed to the expansion of slavery, 11 states rejected the nation\u2019s choice, seceded and attacked the United States. They fought a war for slavery and white supremacy that would leave more than 1.1 million dead and wounded.\n\nBut even the bloody Civil War did not end this battle. Nearly 100 years later, white supremacy would again hold the country\u2019s national security hostage.\n\nIn 1957, during the Cold War, the Soviet Union launched a satellite, Sputnik, into space. That technological prowess sent shock waves through the national security bureaucracy. It meant the U.S.S.R. had capabilities the intelligence agencies had underestimated and, even more important, that the Pacific and Atlantic oceans were no longer major barriers between the Soviets\u2019 nuclear arsenal and targets in the United States.\n\nTechnological heft had to meet technological heft. America needed more scientists and engineers. President Dwight Eisenhower, therefore, insisted the nation could no longer afford to willingly leave so many of its people undereducated. He proposed a bill to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for colleges and universities to create the brainpower to fight the Cold War.\n\nThat effort to defend the nation, however, ran headlong into massive resistance to the Supreme Court\u2019s Brown v. Board of Education (1954) decision. Southern Democrats, who controlled many key committees in Congress, were determined to use every legislative lever to undermine the court\u2019s landmark ruling to end Jim Crow in the schools.\n\nRep. Carl Elliott (D-Ala.) and Sen. Lister Hill (D-Ala.) insisted the National Defense Education Act would pass only if they received assurances from the Eisenhower administration that whites-only schools could continue to defy the Brown decision, deny African Americans admission, yet still receive millions of dollars in federal funding to build up their labs, faculty and curriculum. The Eisenhower administration agreed, choosing to concede to these Southern demands rather than recognizing that capitulation undermined Brown and the rule of law and severely hampered the nation\u2019s ability to create the full cadre of scientists and engineers needed to fend off the Soviets\u2019 challenge.\n\nIn other words, even when faced with the potential of nuclear annihilation, protecting Jim Crow trumped protecting the nation.\n\nThat same destructive pattern defines the United States today as it sits at another crossroads: Are we going to defend American democracy, equal rights and the rule of law or bow down to protect Trump and the white supremacist state he is attempting to rebuild?\n\nFollowing in the path of slaveholders, Trump has popularized racist rhetoric and policies that clearly violate the professed ideals of equality and freedom for which the country claims to stand. Trump has called neo-Nazis \u201cvery fine people,\u201d reportedly suggested asylum seekers from Central America be shot, made clear he preferred immigration from Scandinavia rather than from those \u201cshithole countries\u201d in Africa. He has removed \u201ca nation of immigrants\u201d from the mission of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services and, instead, targeted Muslim, Asian, Haitian and Latino immigrants for bans, deportation and family separation.\n\nJust as segregationists did before him, he has worked to limit voting rights of minorities, amplifying the lie of voter fraud to enable his state-level allies to pursue discriminatory policies such as voter ID laws, voter roll purges and poll closures, all to keep as many African American, Hispanic, Native American and Asian American voters from the ballot box. He has nominated and the GOP-majority Senate has confirmed more than 150 right-wing judges on the federal bench to solidify these gains.\n\nFrom the very beginning then, Trump has staked his presidency on a 21st-century version of white supremacy, emerging around the globe. It is in the service of both white nationalism and his own interests that Trump has repeatedly abused his office and American power and, in the process, threatened U.S. national security. All of this should have triggered the constitutional guardrails to protect the Republic. It didn\u2019t.\n\nWhy? Because Trump remains in high standing with predominantly white Republican base voters who have been vocal about their fears of diversity. A Pew Research Center study showed 46 percent of white adults believe \u201ca majority nonwhite population will weaken American culture.\u201d A New Jersey police chief blatantly expressed his belief that Trump is the \u201clast hope for white people.\u201d It is Trump\u2019s policies that valorize such views and so endear him to Republicans, which, in turn, protects him from accountability.\n\nUntil now.\n\nIt took a Democratic House of Representatives and his attempt to shake down the Ukrainian president to get dirt on a political opponent to finally launch an impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump\u2019s response to the impeachment investigation is revealing: He has encouraged the well-armed and unregulated right-wing militia to go to war if he is held accountable for violating his oath of office and betraying the United States. Just as Southerners did on the eve of the Civil War, historian Heather Cox Richardson has noted, \u201cwhen Trump threatens civil war, he is not just talking about saving his own hide; he is calling for his supporters to rally around race and gender so they protect the oligarchy that has been gathering power for a generation or more.\u201d\n\nSince the nation\u2019s founding, the refusal to believe in democracy and follow through on the nation\u2019s ideals \u2014 equality and freedom \u2014 has been the nation\u2019s consistent enemy. Time and time again, white supremacists have sacrificed these principles to advance their own interests and that of their white supporters. Trump has followed suit, adding the disregard for the rule of law to the list. When challenged, he has also invoked the strategy white supremacist leaders have also mastered: threats of violence and extortion.\n\nUnfortunately, Trump\u2019s threats seem to be working. Although \u201cdemocracy is fighting for its life,\u201d some have contended that regardless of how well justified impeaching him is, it would be perilous for the nation to follow the constitutional mandate for accountability and the rule of law. It would be \u201cdragging America into new and stormy seas.\u201d But that sentiment is the same Damocles\u2019 sword that has hung over the United States since the Revolutionary War.\n\nIt is time we have to call white supremacy\u2019s bluff.\n\nIt is not a belief in democracy that could tear this nation apart. Rather, it is not believing in it that has been this nation\u2019s consistent enemy.", "description": "The connections aren\u2019t as obvious, but America\u2019s front lines remain the same as they\u2019ve always been.", "authors": ["Carol Anderson", "Carol Anderson Is The Charles Howard Candler Professor Of African American Studies At Emory University", "Author Of", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Mhseuer09y3Z9-twrJXR0sM1ylk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6W5OWMXJ6II6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
