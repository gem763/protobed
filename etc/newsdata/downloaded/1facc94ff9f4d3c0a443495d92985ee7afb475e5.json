FOREX-Swedish crown jumps on December rate rise plan, NOK feels spillover, ECB awaited\n\n* Dollar steady with no trade war developments\n\n* Brexit limbo keeps pound near recent highs\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\nBy Sujata Rao and Elizabeth Howcroft\n\nOct 24 (Reuters) - The Swedish crown rose 0.7% on Thursday\n\nas the country's central bank stuck to its plans to raise\n\ninterest rates in December and the Norwegian crown was pulled\n\nhigher as well, despite a relatively dovish message from the\n\nNorges Bank.\n\nA trio of central bank meetings were being held on Thursday,\n\nand while none was expected to make any changes in interest\n\nrates, investors were looking for forward guidance from Sweden\n\nand Norway. A European Central Bank meeting will be Mario\n\nDraghi's last as president.\n\nThe Swedish crown rose to its strongest against the dollar\n\nsince mid-August and gained 0.6% against the euro after the\n\nRiksbank stuck to its plan for raising rates in December, though\n\nit said the rate path after that was not yet clear. SEK=D3\n\nEURSEK=D3 It kept rates steady at -0.25%.\n\nThe Norwegian crown slipped 0.1% against the euro as the\n\nNorges Bank said rates were likely to be held at the current\n\n1.5% rate. EURNOK=D3 . The decline was contained by the Swedish\n\ncrown's rise, because the two currencies often track each other.\n\nThe Norwegian currency gained 0.1% versus the dollar NOK=D3 .\n\n\"We don't think that the SEK gains will last for long,\n\nbecause this interest rate increase may be interpreted by the\n\nmarket as a policy rate mistake,\" said Petr Krpata, chief EMEA\n\nFX strategist and IR strategist at ING, suggesting the bank may\n\nbe \"hiking into a downturn\".\n\nKrpata noted that the Norwegian crown strengthened in line\n\nwith the Swedish crown, around 8.30 London time, meaning that\n\nits strength is \"spillover from the Riksbank decision\".\n\nThe Norwegian crown recently reached a record low to the\n\neuro and an 18-year low to the dollar despite rate hikes this\n\nyear EURNOK=D3 NOK=D3 .\n\nMeanwhile the euro rose 0.2% to a session high of $1.1163\n\nEUR=EBS after data showed French business activity rose more\n\nthan expected in October. It gave up those gains after German\n\nfigures came in weaker than expected\n\nInvestors now await the ECB meeting. No policy changes are\n\nexpected, but investors will be checking to see whether Draghi\n\ntalks about recent reports of rifts within the bank over\n\nstimulus.\n\n\"Today is going to be all about the ECB,\" said Rabobank FX\n\nstrategist Piotr Matys. \"We don't expect the ECB to change the\n\nparameters of its monetary policy,\" but Draghi may use his last\n\nmeeting to encourage governments to use fiscal measures to\n\npropel growth.\n\nMost Asian currencies edged up in the absence of\n\ndevelopments in the Sino-U.S. trade war. The Australian dollar was down 0.2% AUD=D3 versus the U.S.\n\ndollar and the New Zealand dollar fell as much as -0.3% to\n\n0.6403 NZD=D3 .\n\nThe pound was little changed at just under recent highs of\n\n$1.30, having chalked up 6% gains since Irish and British\n\nleaders said they could \"see a possible pathway to a deal\" on\n\nOct. 10.
