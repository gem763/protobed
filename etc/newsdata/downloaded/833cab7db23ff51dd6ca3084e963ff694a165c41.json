But all roads have led here since Eddie Jones grabbed the steering wheel.\n\nFor four years he has built and developed a team capable not only of challenging New Zealand but, he will believe, posing sufficient threat to beat them.\n\nAcross 48 internationals he has tried and tested combinations, theories and temperaments, pushed back the boundaries of what is possible from the players at his disposal.\n\nIt has brought England to where they are now, in Yokohama today, about to run out in front of a 72,000 crowd with an opportunity to, in his words, \u201cchange history\u201d.\n\nYou can be sure that what is about to unfold he has given enormous thought so let us examine the key tactical decision to start with two playmakers.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nA week ago Jones considered Owen Farrell at fly-half, with Manu Tuilagi and Henry Slade in the centres, to be the midfield trio best suited to snuffing out Australia.\n\nIt was a case of a pick a team that is comfortable without the ball and squeeze the life out of the opposition. England\u2019s set-up was all about matching physicality and getting past it.\n\nDefensively they had no weak links while in attack they kept it simple. In football parlance it was the long ball game. Bang it down their end, force a bit of a goalmouth scramble, then pounce on the mistake and tap it in.\n\nThey only had 36 per cent possession and, frankly, didn\u2019t need that much. Australia talked big and played small. It was a walkover, tactically easy for England. Eddie decided to let them have the ball and England squeezed the life out of them.\n\nBut whereas the Aussies put themselves away the All Blacks won\u2019t. This is completely different as nobody has ever beaten New Zealand by just defending. You have to create and score tries.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nWhich is why England have picked two playmakers at 10 and 12 in George Ford and Farrell. It means they will play out from the back, to extend the football analogy.\n\nThey will be happy in possession, manipulate it then kick when they\u2019re ready. And England have so many ball carriers that if they\u2019re going to play ball in hand they need two playmakers to make sure everybody gets a fair share.\n\nPairing Ford and Farrell broadens the pitch. Their ability to run, pass and kick widens the field so the attacking threat becomes that much greater.\n\nBut that in itself is not enough. With twin playmakers you absolutely have to choose right when to get rid of the ball as the All Blacks are masters of giving it to you on their terms.\n\nTheir decision making is so good that what might appear a gamble to some is not to them as they\u2019ve mitigated the risk on the back of really good decision making. They\u2019ll push you deep then force you to give it back so that they can counter-attack.\n\nEngland must be tactically astute and not get impatient. Then maybe, just maybe, they will force the All Blacks to take one risk too far.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nI expect both teams to attack the other\u2019s back three. The All Blacks will know Elliot Daly is magnificent going forward but still working on his defensive positioning and his one-on-one tackling when people make a break.\n\nEngland will go after Sevu Reece, knowing that he has not been challenged particularly in the air. In Jonny May they have a player as good as any in the world at chasing the high ball.\n\nYou don\u2019t accidentally beat the All Blacks. You don\u2019t have an okay day and they have a terrible one. That doesn\u2019t happen. You have to be better than them, full stop.\n\nIt is a huge ask for this England side but no mission impossible. They need to have their day of days, but why not. It\u2019s what they\u2019ve built towards for four years.", "description": "For the past four years, England have been building up to this moment as they prepare for the World Cup semi-final", "authors": ["Paul Grayson", "Image", "Getty Images", "Reuters", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20724845.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-Captains-Run-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
