It\u2019s still not clear why she pulled the trigger, whether it was an accident or related to the suicidal thoughts the child had expressed. But when her mother returned from the store, Brandajah was dead from a single gunshot to the head.\n\nBrandajah\u2019s death in 2013 was shocking, but few people who knew her were surprised.\n\nFor almost a year, her teachers had repeatedly reported suspicions that she was being sexually abused. They also told authorities that she talked about her own death, what it would be like in heaven and about the gun in her home.\n\nFollowing Brandajah\u2019s death, officials from Louisiana\u2019s Department of Children & Family Services told the Times Picayune newspaper that the agency \u201cthoroughly investigated each of the complaints received.\u201d But they also said that Brandajah\u2019s mother, Laderika Smith, was not complying with the \u201csafety plan\u201d that the agency had set up. In November 2012 \u2013 after months of leaving the child in a home with her mother and the mother\u2019s boyfriend, who owned the gun (both are felons) \u2013 DCFS asked the local court to either order compliance or give the agency the authority to take the child away. By the time of the kindergartner\u2019s death, the court had done neither.\n\nChild welfare case files are not public, so it is not clear why the court did not act in Brandajah\u2019s case. But that inaction came amid a growing push by liberal advocacy groups, child welfare agencies, and some judges to leave children in troubled homes instead of placing them in foster care.\n\nNo one argues that foster care cannot be improved. But this movement, which boasts strong financial and political support, is drawing attention for two reasons. First are concerns that it puts children at risk. The second is that it is based on racial ideology that ignores the evidence about child maltreatment.\n\nErnestine Steward Gray: New Orleans judge sees racism in placing black kids in foster care.\n\nA prime mover of this effort is Judge Ernestine Steward Gray, who has served in the Orleans Parish Juvenile Court since 1984. Because the case files are sealed, it is not publicly known whether she was directly involved in Brandajah\u2019s case. But she is currently the judge primarily responsible for the vast majority of \u201cchild in need of care\u201d cases. She has long argued that the child welfare system unfairly targets minority children for removal from their homes and is widely acknowledged to have almost singlehandedly shifted the parish\u2019s policies on foster care.\n\nShe also has a powerful ally in the effort \u2013 Casey Family Programs. The organization, which has a $2.2 billion endowment, recently gave Judge Gray a leadership award honoring those who have \u201chad a significant impact in improving outcomes for children and families and building Communities of Hope.\u201d\n\nJooYeun Chang, the managing director of public policy at Casey Family Programs, argued last year that the foster care system \u201ctraumatize[s] kids by removing them from the only communities they have known\u201d only to place them in living situations that \u201care no better than jails.\u201d The reason so many kids, particularly minority kids, are removed from the home, she said, is that \u201cour system has been built on centuries of racism, classism and xenophobia.\u201d\n\nImage from the Casey Family Programs website, which supports Gray's effort to keep African American children in their homes.\n\nAcross the country, advocates influenced and sometimes even trained by Casey Family Programs espouse the view that the child welfare system is racially biased and structured to break up minority families rather than protect children. In response, they say, the system should try to keep kids in their homes, reunify them more quickly if they have been removed, or keep them with extended family because they share the same racial background.\n\nJames Dwyer, a law professor at the College of William & Mary, has argued that minority parents \u2013 black parents especially \u2013 are often seen as the victims of racism and poverty, so there is a growing push to give them as many chances as possible.\n\nRichard Gelles, former dean of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s School of Social Work, believes that leaving children in unsafe environments in the name of family preservation and racial justice is dangerous. \u201cIt\u2019s almost immoral to hold a child's development hostage while you wait for parents to turn their lives around \u2013 if in fact they are going to be able to turn their lives around,\u201d he told the PBS program \u201cFrontline.\u201d \u201cWhat if it takes a parent five or six or eight years to turn their life around \u2026 and the only way you know that you've failed is the child is injured or harmed\u201d in the meantime?\n\nDwyer said that is often the result. \u201cWe know that a substantial portion of parents reported once for maltreatment will be reported again if the child remains in their custody,\u201d he told RCI. By contrast, \u201cwe know rates of abuse and neglect in foster care are miniscule by comparison \u2014 one quarter of 1% annually.\u201d\n\nIn that light, it appears that Judge Gray and likeminded people across the country are conducting a high-stakes experiment \u2013 applying a new standard for what constitutes abuse and neglect for minority children and where at-risk children should be placed if they are removed. She is doing it with the full knowledge of state officials, but without any public announcement or scrutiny. She may also be in violation of federal equal-protection law. Gray says that she decides cases on an individual basis, but the people in her courtroom say that the issue of race is regularly invoked there and state officials say it is absolutely impacting her decisions.\n\nIn a phone interview on Sept. 12, Gray told RealClearInvestigations that \u201cthere is not a lot of clarity about the standards\u201d for when to remove children from their homes. She says she will only remove a child \u201cwhen it is absolutely necessary to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of that child.\u201d But she also knows that her standard differs significantly from that of other judges. \u201cI do believe I have a higher standard in terms of proof. I believe it is the appropriate one.\u201d\n\nGray even notes that when she is the duty judge \u2013 the one who gets called if a DCFS worker wants to remove a child during the night \u2013 \u201cthe calls are substantially down.\u201d In other words, some caseworkers who have determined a child is in an emergency situation evidently presume Gray will likely turn down the request, so they don\u2019t ask.\n\nGray\u2019s views are taking hold in New Orleans. Between 2010 and 2018, the number of children in foster care in Orleans Parish fell almost 75%, from 126 to 36. During the same period, neighboring parishes have seen significant increases. East Baton Rouge, for instance, has gone from 126 to 208 during the same period. A map of Louisiana suggests that Orleans is a startling outlier with a rate of 1.7 children in foster care per 1,000 compared with neighboring St. Tammany and St. Bernard with rates of 4.9 and 6.8, respectively. The national average is 6 per 1,000 children.\n\nAbuse victim: A cautionary image from a Louisiana recruitment video for child welfare workers.\n\nNationwide there has been an increase in the number of children entering foster care, from 397,000 in 2012 to 443,000 in 2018. Estimates vary, but for every five incidents in which a child is removed from his or her home, two to four of them have to do with a family member\u2019s substance abuse. And Louisiana\u2019s drug problem has certainly been getting worse. Its rate of overdose deaths has increased to 24.5 per 1,000, compared to the national average of 21.7.\n\nIn the past eight years, reports of child abuse and neglect in Orleans Parish have almost doubled from 2,556 to 5,589, and the number that merit an investigation has risen from 1,044 to 1,777. All of which suggests that, if anything, Orleans should be seeing a rise in the number of kids needing to be removed from their homes. But the parish is moving in the opposite direction.\n\nIn the past six months, RealClearInvestigations spoke with a local pediatrician specializing in abuse cases, a lawyer who has appeared in Gray\u2019s court, foster families, and others who have worked in local foster care and child welfare. None of them were willing to speak on the record because they continue to appear in the judge\u2019s courtroom.\n\nBut they all said they are deeply concerned about efforts to leave children in troubled homes. And they all report that Gray\u2019s reputation for denying state\u2019s petitions for removal matters for both investigations and prosecutions. One foster parent said she has talked to children who have begged Gray not to make them go back to neglectful situations with their biological parents. Another person told RCI that the judge berated a lawyer for bringing a case against black parents that she says he never would have brought against white ones.\n\nBoth on and off the bench, Gray has suggested that racism is a major problem in the child welfare system. She has repeatedly invoked disparate impact theory, the idea that race-neutral policies can be racist if they impact one group more than others. In a 2018 article for the Louisiana Bar Journal titled \u201cThe Color of Justice for Children,\u201d Gray wrote, \u201cNationally, youth of color are disproportionately represented at every decision point in the child welfare system. Their families are disproportionately referred to the system by institutions such as hospitals, schools and law enforcement.\u201d\n\nSome say it could be racist: An image from an official Louisiana state booklet on foster care and adoption.\n\nDuring the interview with RCI, Gray said she tries to make decisions on a case-by-case basis but she said she knows that \u201cAfrican Americans don\u2019t make up 100% of the poor people in New Orleans. I have to wonder why poor white parents and poor Vietnamese parents aren\u2019t being brought in.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2016 report from the Children\u2019s Information Gateway, black children made up 13.8% of the child population in the United States and 22.6% of those identified as victims by child protective services. Black children make up 24.3% of kids in foster care.\n\nIn her article, Gray rests her claim of racial bias on \u201cresearch [that] shows that rates of child abuse and neglect are not higher in families of color. \u2026 [Factors contributing to this phenomenon] include poverty, a lack of community resources, as well as institutional biases from the police, the child welfare agency and the courts.\u201d\n\nBut national statistics report that black children are more likely to suffer maltreatment and black women are more likely to be the victims of abuse than whites. Although various factors contribute to this, single parenthood, and especially living with a man who is not the biological father, is a common theme in a notable percentage of abuse cases. According to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the incidence of physical abuse for a child living with a single parent and a \u201cpartner\u201d is 19.5 per 1,000. That\u2019s almost twice as high as for children living with unmarried biological parents or a parent married to a nonbiological parent, and almost 10 times as high as for married biological parents. The data are similar for sexual abuse.\n\nAccording to data from Child Trends, 70% of all births to black women in 2014 occurred outside of marriage, compared with only 29% of all births to white women. Family structure is a deeply important factor in determining the likelihood of interaction with child welfare officials \u2013 one that disproportionately hurts black children.\n\nA 2009 article in the newsletter for the National Court Appointed Special Advocates Association, featuring the views of Gray and others, quoted another judge on the issue of disparate racial impact on domestic violence: \u201cWomen of color experience higher rates of intimate partner violence than white women. Evidence also suggests a great disproportionality in the arrest, prosecution and lengths of sentence for domestic violence crimes.\u201d\n\nIf women of color are more likely to be victims of domestic violence, then it would seem logical that men of color (most likely to be married to or partnered with women of color) would experience a higher than average rate of arrest and prosecution. Similarly, if black children are disproportionately likely to be abused or neglected, then it follows that black parents are going to be disproportionately the subject of investigations by our child welfare agencies.\n\nRhenda Hodnett, Louisiana assistant secretary of child welfare, says \u201cdifferent communities have different ideas and thoughts around what is abuse and what isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nRhenda Hodnett, Louisiana\u2019s assistant secretary of child welfare, said there\u2019s another way of interpreting the relatively low number of Orleans Parish children in foster care, though she admitted that it is \u201chard to wrap your head around.\u201d She said that \u201cdifferent communities have different ideas and thoughts around what is abuse and what isn\u2019t.\u201d Though she says the state \u201cdoes a lot of training on how to recognize abuse and neglect,\u201d she adds that \u201ccommunity norms are a little different.\u201d\n\nThis seems an odd explanation, because the number of reports of abuse and neglect in Orleans Parish doubled between 2010 and 2018. Most abuse and neglect calls are not made by bureaucrats who swoop in from the outside but by doctors, teachers, and social workers, many of whom are from the same racial background as the children being reported. So the \u201ccommunity\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to have lowered its standards for reporting abuse and neglect.\n\nHodnett seems to argue that Gray, who is African American, is better able to determine these \u201ccommunity norms\u201d than the community she is ostensibly serving. Gray \u201cis truly an eminent judge and respected across nation on issue of disproportionality,\u201d Hodnett said. \u201cHer antenna is high. She watches that closely. Race is absolutely something that impacts her decision making. She makes no bones about that.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just that race seems to play a role in Gray\u2019s decisions about removals, but also about where children should be placed if they do have to be removed. In the interview, she said she is committed to ensuring that those children can be placed with their extended family (who likely share their skin color). She worries that \u201crestrictions on placing kids with relatives who have criminal records\u201d has created a problem for these families because \u201cwho are the people who have more relatives in the criminal justice system? It\u2019s minorities.\u201d In other words, Gray is suggesting that the standards for which homes may legally take in minority children should lowered.\n\nGray has also recommended that judges should \u201cconsider race as a factor when placing children for adoption (e.g., by applying provisions similar to those in the Indian Child Welfare Act to African American children) \u2026 vigorously recruit families whose background reflects that of children waiting to be adopted and who will adopt older children.\u201d\n\nGray\u2019s encouragement of her fellow jurists to consider race as a factor in placing children in foster homes may be illegal (she did not respond to a follow-up email seeking comment on this point). Walter Olson, a lawyer and senior fellow at the Cato Institute, told RCI that \"since 1996 \u2026 federal law has made it explicitly unlawful for a state that receives federal adoption or foster care funding to delay or deny any placement because of the parent's or child's race, ethnicity, or national origin, except for kids that fall under the Indian Child Welfare Act.\n\n\u201cWithout a change in federal law, it's not at all clear how Judge Gray would expect states to move toward restricting transracial placements for black kids. And even if federal law did change, denying children placement because a family is of the \u2018wrong\u2019 race could still run afoul of the U.S. Constitution.\"\n\nThe goal of foster care and adoption out of foster care is to place children in stable, loving homes. A quarter-century ago, when the Interethnic Placement Act was passed, the left and the right agreed that these homes could be provided by parents of any race. That consensus may be disappearing.\n\nSome child advocates in Orleans Parish believe Gray\u2019s activism on the bench is wreaking havoc with the youngest residents of that parish. But Assistant Secretary Hodnett suggests everything is under control. She said that the \u201crepeat maltreatment rates\u201d for Orleans Parish have not changed since the foster care rates started falling.\n\nThe state, however, does not seem to have the numbers to back up that claim. A representative of Louisiana\u2019s Department of Children & Family Services says repeat maltreatment claims are tracked only as a regional total for three parishes, and data for Orleans cannot be broken out (even though almost all other child welfare indicators are tracked by parish). And the numbers they do have are only available for six months despite the fact that repeat maltreatment often takes longer to manifest.\n\nGray said, \u201cI\u2019m not doing research. I don\u2019t know if a family comes back to the attention of the department unless it results in another court case\u201d and she happens to be the one hearing it. She says that \u201cwe are trying to figure out how we can gather those numbers,\u201d but right now \u201cit\u2019s all kind of speculation.\u201d\n\nWhile state officials and advocates such as Casey Family Programs are talking up Judge Gray and her innovative jurisprudence inside of child welfare policy circles, the people of Orleans Parish who vote for their family court judges have received no notice of these changes. And because court records are kept sealed, it\u2019s impossible to evaluate the plan to leave more and more children in homes where parents have been accused of abuse or severe neglect \u2013 including cases like Brandajah Smith\u2019s.\n\nHer noncustodial father, Brandon Pierre, 29, of Metairie, spoke to the Times-Picayune one day this summer after reviewing records he obtained from his daughter's school. \"To read all of that now, to hear all of those things, I choked up all over again,\" he said. \"I can't believe this was going on and I had no idea.\"\n\nNaomi Schaefer Riley is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a senior fellow at the Independent Women\u2019s Forum.", "description": "Five-year-old old Brandajah Smith grabbed the loaded .38-caliber revolver after her mother left her alone in their New Orleans apartment.
