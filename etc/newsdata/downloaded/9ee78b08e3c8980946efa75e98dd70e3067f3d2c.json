Arguably, the entire market was not informed when the panic selling hit.\n\nWhen VGI released its first short report on Corporate Travel Partners last year, it had two weeks earlier sent an email to the company's then chief financial officer, Steve Fleming, with a list of questions.\n\nVGI engages with companies before releasing its forensic analysis of their accounts.\n\nWhen it released a copy of the report to its wholesale clients, it was outside trading hours on the weekend of October 27-28. Corporate Travel took several days to digest and respond to the report, which led to a two-day trading halt.\n\nChanticleer understands VGI distributed its report on Corporate Travel to its wholesale clients in accordance with its Australian Financial Services Licence. This did not prevent Corporate Travel shares falling 30 per cent when they resumed trading on October 31, 2018.\n\nThe essential point is that the entire market should be properly informed and the company should be given an opportunity to get a taste of what is being put forward in the short thesis outside of trading hours. VGI set a high standard when it voluntarily released its second report on Corporate Travel to the ASX and ASIC before it was released to VGI's wholesale clients.\n\nASX chief executive Dominic Stevens said the short attacks posed difficult problems both for the ASX and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI make no comment about any particular company,\u201d he said in an interview with Chanticleer.\n\n\u201cHowever, I think it is a good thing that people have been able to put their views.\n\n\u201cBut I think it's a very complex area.\n\n\u201cThere's no black and white here. Some reports in the past have come out and said true things about companies that were doing bad things.\n\n\u201cAnd in the world of whistleblowing, that's a positive. What I'm worried about and what I think we should all be worried about, is people that just do it vexatiously. So, how you actually manage that is very difficult.\n\nWe're not in control of these reports and we can\u2019t instruct foreign entities how to act. \u2014 Dominic Stevens, ASX chief executive\n\n\u201cAt its core, as acknowledged, this is a matter for the regulators rather than the market operator. But I can see that it's a difficult situation and it's hard to have a hard and fast rule that allows information to continue to flow.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s the problem of how you enforce that. If something\u2019s released overseas, can you actually do anything about it? I'm not sure. And even if you could, it would need international co-operation and regulation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere have been many examples of this all over the world \u2013 it's not just in Australia \u2013 where reports have actually brought up valid issues, which can be a good thing. How it's brought up, however, is another question.\n\n\u201cIf it was bona fide and you'd written a five-page report, and it wasn't all about scaring the market, you would in fairness to the company put it out on a Friday night, for example, and give the company the opportunity to respond.\n\n\u201cThe trouble is, we're not in control of these reports and we can\u2019t instruct foreign entities how to act. But should we stop the publication of negative reports generally? No, I don't think so.\n\n\u201cIf a report is being put out in the middle of the trading day, which deals with highly technical accounting and other issues, and will clearly take some time to digest and respond to, this is only going to cause uncertainty and disruption. It\u2019s not surprising that people question the motives.\u201d", "description": "The short sellers and research houses attacking Australian listed companies would do themselves a favour if they adopted a more transparent and responsible approach.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7926%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_139/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7e5fc6ce1c716bd68c7b9dcfd22d08cfcf72d729", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
