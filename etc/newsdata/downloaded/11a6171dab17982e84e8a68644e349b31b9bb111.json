Open letter from musicians to Amazon.\u201d\n\nThe artists said they are pledging to not participate in Amazon-sponsored events, or engage in exclusive partnerships with Amazon in the future, until Amazon publicly commits to terminating existing contracts with military, law enforcement, and government agencies like ICE that \u201ccommit human rights abuses.\u201d\n\nTheir demands to Amazon include the cessation of Cloud services and other digital tools to private sector groups such as Palantir Technologies that \u201cpower the U.S. government\u2019s deportation machine.\u201d\n\nPalantir, co-founded by billionaire Peter Thiel, is a data analytics firm that has provided services to the federal government\u2019s counterterrorism efforts as well as ICE.\n\nThe musicians are also demanding that the company halts all projects \u201cthat encourage racial profiling and discrimination, such as Amazon\u2019s facial recognition product.\u201d\n\nFight For the Future launched a new Twitter account, @NoMusicForICE, which is encouraging more musicians to \u201cstand in solidarity against ICE and tech companies like Amazon that power it.\u201d\n\nThe music community will not be complicit! We invite musicians to stand in solidarity against ICE and tech companies like Amazon that power it.
