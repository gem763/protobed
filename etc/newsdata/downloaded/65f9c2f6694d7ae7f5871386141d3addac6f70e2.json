The White House statement gave no further details.\n\nUS TO SHARE NAME OF SAUDI SUSPECTED OF AIDING 9/11 ATTACKERS\n\nReports of Hamza\u2019s death first surfaced in July, however, details were not immediately available. President Trump and U.S. officials had refused to comment on the death until Saturday\u2019s statement.\n\nBrett Bruen, former White House director of global engagements, told Fox News last month that the death of Bin Laden's son would be a \"big brand hit for extremists.\"\n\n\"Bin Laden\u2019s son was heir to the throne. Even if he didn\u2019t exercise operational control, his name and those actions requested to be carried out in his name carries weight in amongst those who were drawn to Al Qaeda by his father,\u201d Bruen, who is president of crusts communications firm Global Situation Room, Inc., said. \u201cThere may be others who take on leadership roles. It will be a long time, if ever, we see someone who can legitimately claim the legacy of a near-mythical figure like Bin Laden. For those engaged in the long fight against extremism, this is a significant symbolic victory.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to AEI's Critical Threats Project, Hamza's sermons mirrored those his father gave in his heyday of the '80s and '90s - that included attacking the U.S., the West, Russia, and Israel - before they shifted to in 2017 to endorse the jihad in Syria. He also called on Salafi groups to come together under the Al Qaeda banner.\n\nAs the leader of Al Qaeda, Usama Bin Laden and others plotted the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. U.S. Navy SEALs killed him in a raid on a house in Abbottabad, Pakistan in 2011.\n\nFox News' Hollie McKay contributed to this report.\n\nThis is a developing story.
