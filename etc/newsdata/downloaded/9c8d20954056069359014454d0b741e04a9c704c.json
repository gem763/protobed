They aim to raise a whopping $1 billion for the re-election. \u201cPresident Trump has built a juggernaut of a campaign, raising record amounts of money at a record pace,\u201d Parscale boasted in a statement.\n\nIt isn\u2019t the first time Trump, a businessman with a global real estate empire, has faced accusations that he didn\u2019t pay his bills. The complaints from local governments echo decades of accusations by private contractors who claim that Trump didn\u2019t adequately compensate them for their work before he was sworn into office.\n\nAt least 60 lawsuits and more than 200 liens detailed allegations that Trump and his companies failed to pay various businesses and scores of employees for their work, according to an investigation by USA Today in 2016. Those who claimed they were stiffed by the future president included bartenders, painters, real estate brokers and others.\n\nThe Trump campaign declined to answer questions about specific cities.\n\n\u201cIt is the U.S. Secret Service, not the campaign, which coordinates with local law enforcement,\u201d Michael Glassner, the campaign\u2019s chief operating officer, wrote in a statement. \u201cThe campaign itself does not contract with local governments for police involvement. All billing inquiries should always go to the Secret Service.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

But it\u2019s law enforcement agencies that often bill campaigns for helping with crowds, security and closing streets when a candidate comes to town, though some absorb the cost themselves.\n\nLocal officials in at least three cities \u2014 El Paso , Texas; Tucson , Ariz.; and Lebanon , Ohio \u2014 have said in recent days that bills remain unpaid.\n\nEl Paso billed Trump\u2019s campaign $570,000 for his visit in February, including a one-time late fee of $98,800.\n\nLebanon is owed $16,200, mostly to defray the cost of the city\u2019s police department, for an October 2018 event.\n\nTucson officials billed Trump\u2019s campaign more than $80,000 for Trump\u2019s visit in 2016 where 180 police officers provided security.\n\nOf the 10 cities listed in the Center for Public Integrity study, five \u2014 Tucson; Green Bay and Eau Claire, Wis.; Burlington, Vt.; and Spokane, Wash. \u2014 date back to 2016 when Trump was running for office.\n\nTrump has headlined more than 70 rallies since he\u2019s been elected president, and now expects to hold one rally roughly every two weeks for the next several months as he embarks on a tough re-election campaign. He is scheduled to be in Louisiana on Friday and Dallas on Oct. 17, and may appear in Kentucky and Mississippi before their statewide elections in November.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump joined his campaign in criticizing Minneapolis officials, including the mayor and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), a frequent critic whose district includes the city.\n\n\u201cThe lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters. 72,000 ticket requests already,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cDump Frey and Omar! Make America Great Again!\u201d\n\nJones Day, the law firm representing the Trump campaign, wrote a letter to the arena that a \u201clast-minute squeeze\u201d by the city government \u201cseems to be nothing but a pretextual political effort with serious First Amendment ramifications\u201d and threatened court action if denied access to the venue.\n\nFrey responded an hour later, quoting Trump\u2019s message and tweeting: \u201cYawn... Welcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Parscale sent out a statement that the Target Center, the venue for this week\u2019s rally, had backed off canceling the contract. \u201cConsistent with our original agreement with the venue, the Trump campaign has not agreed to pay any additional funds,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFrey didn\u2019t immediately respond.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t the only candidate to not pay the bills. In 2016, Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders left bills for campaign events unpaid in dozens of cities, according to the Center for Public Integrity.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/07/90/5679ad8d4ef4b8ddf730ae7c5cce/191008-trump-rally-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
