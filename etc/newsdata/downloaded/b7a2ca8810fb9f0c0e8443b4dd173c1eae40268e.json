While this might sound far, in astronomical terms it\u2019s extremely close.\n\nNASA defines this distance as a \u2018close approach\u2019, meaning 2019 SR8 is deemed a \u2018near-Earth object.\u2019\n\nThankfully the chance of a collision is very low, according to NASA.\n\nIt explained: \u201cNASA knows of no asteroid or comet currently on a collision course with Earth, so the probability of a major collision is quite small.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\u201cIn fact, as best as we can tell, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years.\u201d\n\nHowever, NASA administrator, Jim Bridenstine, recently warned that we need to take the real-world threat of an asteroid strike more seriously.\n\nHe said: \"We have to make sure that people understand that this is not about Hollywood, it's not about movies. This is about ultimately protecting the only planet we know, right now, to host life, and that is the planet Earth.\"\n\nNASA is currently working towards the gaol of being able to detect and track 90% of nearby asteroids that are 140 metres or larger. A space rock of this size could cause catastrophic damage, and even wipe out an entire country.", "description": "The asteroid, dubbed 2019 SR8, is estimated to measure between 20 metres and 44 metres in diameter", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Alamy"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19007426.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_asteroid-approaching-planet-Earth-meteorite-in-orbit-before-impact.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
