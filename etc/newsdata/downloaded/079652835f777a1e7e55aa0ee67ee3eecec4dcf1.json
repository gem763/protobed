The Renaissance IPO exchange-traded fund is up 30% through Tuesday\u2019s close, down from its 44% year-to-date performance in July but still sharply outperforming the broader stock markets. Those returns are even more impressive given the sharp year-to-date declines in two of its holdings: Uber Technologies and Lyft.\n\nThe strong IPO returns are good news for the deals waiting in the wings, including SmileDirect Club, which sells clear aligners directly to consumers. They eliminate the need to go to an orthodontist and reduce the cost of straightening one\u2019s teeth by 60%, SmileDirect says. The company, which is unprofitable, plans to raise up to $1.3 billion in its IPO.\n\nSmileDirect and WeWork\u2014which has a $3 billion IPO pending\u2014both will use an umbrella partnership corporation, or an \u201cup-C,\u201d when they go public. \u201cThe structure allows companies to sell shares through a public holding company that owns a stake in an underlying limited liability company, where certain company executives and early investors continue to hold their economic interests. Unlike WeWork, SmileDirectClub also said it would use a so-called tax receivable agreement granting LLC members 85% of the savings generated by an increase in the company\u2019s tax basis,\u201d an Aug. 16 Financial Times article stated.\n\n\u2014Edward Yardeni\n\nThe Trade War Imperils Jobs\n\nHot Charts\n\nby National Bank of Canada\n\nnbc.ca\n\nSept. 5: Nearly 1.4 million private-sector jobs were created in the first eight months of 2019 in the U.S. according to the ADP...\u2026Firms with 500 or more employees have created roughly a half-million private-sector jobs so far this year. In other words, those large firms account for 36% of private-sector job creation this year, the highest share since 2010. Such growing dependence on large firms arguably makes the U.S. labor market more vulnerable to the escalating U.S.-China trade war.\u2026Unless there is a superpower truce, it\u2019s hard to see U.S. job creation maintaining the pace in \u201920.\n\n\u2014Krishen Rangasamy\n\nS&P 500 Earnings Outlook\n\nU.S. Investment Policy Committee Notes\n\nby CFRA\n\ncfraresearch.com\n\nSept. 4: Investors have a lot to worry about over the coming month, from general economic data and their impact on the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to lower rates at the midmonth Federal Open Market Committee meeting, to the ongoing trade dispute and the continued softening of third-quarter S&P 500 index earnings-per-share growth expectations. Indeed, S&P 500 third-quarter EPS is now projected to decline 3.3%, year on year, according to S&P Capital IQ consensus estimates, versus the 0.2% shortfall anticipated on June 30. What\u2019s more, mid- and small-cap benchmarks had even deeper reductions to estimates, while 10 of 11 sectors saw downward revisions to their third-quarter growth forecasts, led by the consumer-discretionary, energy, and materials sectors. Only real estate saw improved expectations. But we don\u2019t see an EPS recession, as fourth-quarter\u2019 growth estimate of 3.8% should more than offset third-quarter\u2019s weakness.
