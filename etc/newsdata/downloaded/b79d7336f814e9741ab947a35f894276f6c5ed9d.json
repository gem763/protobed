The rally was an effort to drive messaging around Red Ribbon Week, a nation-wide campaign that encourages students to pledge to live drug free that starts on Oct. 23.\n\n\u201cWe need to continue encouraging teenagers and young adults that have fallen into drug addiction to be brave enough to admit it, to talk about it, and to get help,\u201d said Trump. \u201cThis also includes addiction associated with e-cigarettes and vaping.
