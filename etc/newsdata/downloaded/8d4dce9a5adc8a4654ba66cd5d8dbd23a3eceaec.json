It also enshrines senior military and political figures convicted of war crimes by an international tribunal after World War II.\n\nVisits to the shrine by government officials have angered countries that suffered at the hands of the Japanese military during World War II, particularly South Korea and China.\n\nRelations between Tokyo and Seoul are already at their lowest point in years over a long-running dispute related to Japan's use of forced labor during the war.\n\nThe dispute has seen the two sides swap retaliatory trade sanctions, with the number of South Korean visitors to Japan plummeting in recent months.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "A Japanese minister on Thursday visited the Yasukuni war shrine at the centre of long-running tensions with regional neighbors -- the first cabinet-level official visit in over two years.
