Among the bills was a national version of a mandate of extreme risk protection orders (ERPOs), which already is being used in 13 states.\n\nAlso known as \u201cred flag\u201d laws, ERPOs allow local authorities or family members to take away weapons, through a court order, from any individual who is a potential threat toward themselves or others. While the law was passed by Congress, it will likely stall on the Senate floor.\n\nThe proposals have ignited a debate about whether red flags laws are effective.\n\n\u201cERPOs are an incredibly valuable tool for keeping guns out of the hands of people intent on causing harm,\u201d said Kristen Ellingboe, who is with the Alliance for Gun Responsibility, which supports red flag laws, to Fox News. \"They are effective in preventing mass shootings and suicide, in particular.\u201d\n\nREP. MATT GAETZ CHALLENGES PRO-GUN CONTROL LAWMAKERS TO GIVE UP SECURITY DETAILS\n\nOthers warn that a lack of data does little to help prove that red flag laws have been effective in the 13 states that have passed them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to judge which way the numbers really are going,\u201d said one official within the National Rifle Association (NRA). \u201cIf the trend already shows a decline in these states before the laws were put in place, is it actually because of red flag laws or is it because the trends were already there?\u201d\n\nThe White House is even considering a proposal recently presented by a longtime friend of President Trump -- former NBC chairman Bob Wright -- who suggested that a new research arm called the Health Advanced Research Projects Agency (HARPA) be developed to tackle health issues and problems in the same way that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) does for the military issues.\n\nIncluded in Wright\u2019s proposal was a program dubbed SAFEHOME, an acronym for Stopping Aberrant Fatal Events by Helping Overcome Mental Extremes, which would look into technology--including smartphones, watches and health trackers--to help detect when mentally ill people are about to turn violent.\n\nWhile the technology has not been developed as of yet, the mere mention of the possibility of using people\u2019s devices to monitor their potential for violence has left many troubled by the prospects.\n\nBETO'S AR-15 FLIP-FLOP: O'ROURKE ONCE VOWED 'NOBODY' WANTS TO SEIZE GUNS\n\n\u201cI would love if some new technology suddenly came along that would help us identify violent risk, but there\u2019s so many things about this idea of predicting violence that doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d said Marisa Randazzo, former chief research psychologist for the U.S. Secret Service, to The Washington Post, noting not only concerns about civil liberty, but also about the potential for false positives.\n\nEven without the use of technology, Ellingboe said that it can be difficult to collect data on the exact number of gun tragedies that are prevented, but that estimates suggest for every 10 to 12 firearms secured with a red flag law, one suicide is prevented.\n\n\u201cIn King County alone, at least 200 firearms were secured through the ERPO process in 2018, so the impact is substantial,\u201d she said.\n\nA pair of recent studies in Indiana and Connecticut, respectively, suggest that suicides have gone down after those states' red flag laws were enacted.\n\nOther NRA officials also cited a 2016 study that detailed the circumstances behind the use of red flag laws in Connecticut, saying that there are some concerns with the findings--mainly the low number of people who actually received mental health treatment after their weapons were seized as a result of that state\u2019s red flag law.\n\n\u201cAmong the many failures of Connecticut\u2019s red flag law, it doesn\u2019t provide comprehensive and compassionate treatment to those suffering from a mental health crisis,\u201d NRA spokesperson Catherine Mortensen said in a statement to Fox News. \u201cIn fact, less than one-third of those impacted by red flag received mental health treatment after their firearms were seized.\n\n\u201cThis law strips law-abiding citizens of their Second Amendment rights without due process. We need meaningful approaches to reducing violence that includes fixing our broken mental health system while keeping our freedoms intact. This law accomplishes neither of those goals.\"\n\nBut Ellingboe, of the Alliance for Gun Responsibility, said that there\u2019s sufficient evidence that the laws are effective.\n\n\u201cJust last week, an ERPO was used to secure 146 guns from a Maryland man who threatened a workplace shooting,\u201d she said. \u201cLast year, Vermont's law helped thwart a planned school shooting. And earlier this summer, Oregon authorities issued an ERPO against a man who threatened protesters.\u201d\n\nSince August, the push for red flag laws has been gaining momentum, especially since Trump has thrown his support behind them.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I support strong, meaningful background checks where people who are insane, mentally ill \u2014 where people like that should not have guns,\" Trump said during an August rally in New Hampshire. \"It's not the gun that pulls the trigger. It's the person that pulls the trigger.\"", "description": "The latest debate in gun control has raised red flags on both sides of the political aisle while gaining bipartisan support on Capitol Hill.", "authors": ["Perry Chiaramonte", "Perry Chiaramonte Is A Producer With Fox News Channel'S Investigative Unit.
