And it\u2019s not just scones and cream that will be affected.\n\nAmong those speaking out against the tariffs have been textile and clothing makers, who face the raised duties on wool and cashmere.\n\nThe trade group Walpole, which represents more than 250 luxury British brands including Alexander McQueen, Burberry and Tanqueray gin, voiced \u201cdeep frustration\u201d at Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on goods including whisky, liqueur and wine; cashmere; bed linen and men and women\u2019s clothing.\n\n\u201cIt is of particular concern that these tariffs come at a time when there is already so much political and economic uncertainty,\u201d said a spokesperson, noting that 24% of British luxury goods are destined for North America.\n\nAccording to the group, two-thirds of its members name the US as their priority export market.\n\n\u201cTo penalize businesses that are in significant expansion phases, looking for new routes into the US and creating products American consumers desire \u2013 Johnston\u2019s of Elgin cashmere, Peter Reed bed linen, Savile Row suits, English wine and numerous Scotch whiskies \u2013 will likely impact consumer choice as well as business growth.\u201d\n\nAround 23% of exports from British luxury brands in 2017 headed to the US, with a majority of firms seeing it as the primary market for future growth, according to Walpole.\n\nOverall, the British luxury sector, which employs 160,000 workers, is bracing for new pressure from the tariffs on top of a projected loss of \u00a36.8bn in revenue in the event of no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe fashion and textile sector, itself anticipating a \u00a31bn-a-year loss in revenue from a no-deal Brexit, will see exports worth \u00a335m affected by the tariffs, according to the UK Fashion and Textile Association (UKFT).\n\nSavile Row\u2019s tailors, a favorite of Wall Street bankers with several outposts in Manhattan, are expected to be especially badly hit, in part because French and Italian competitors are not affected by the additional levies. If UK manufacturers were hoping the US would provide a hedge against Brexit, the opposite is now true.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest London\u2019s Savile Row tailors are expected to be hit hard by Trump\u2019s latest tariffs Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nThe Department for International Trade in London, which is requesting an exception on British goods arguing that the Airbus trade infringements were not related to UK manufacturing, said in a statement:\n\n\u201cResorting to tariffs is not in the interests of the UK, EU or US. The UK is working closely with the US, EU and European partners to support a negotiated settlement to the Airbus and Boeing disputes,\u201d said a spokesman.\n\nAnother of the industries likely to feel the hit is the cashmere industry. The US imported $362m worth of cashmere sweaters last year. Bruce Gifford of the e-commerce brand Naked Cashmere told Women\u2019s Wear Daily the cost of the tariffs would almost certainly be passed on to the consumer.\n\n\u201cI think anybody that in the long run says that they\u2019re not going to be raising prices is just lying to you. You have to make a certain amount of money to stay in business,\u201d he told trade paper Women\u2019s Wear Daily.\n\nBut the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, has defended the measures, accusing Europe of \u201cproviding massive subsidies to Airbus that have seriously injured the US aerospace industry and our workers\u201d.\n\nNow the row looks certain to escalate. The European commissioner for trade, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, warned the US countermeasures would be push \u201cthe EU into a situation where we will have no other option than to do the same\u201d.\n\nAccording to Ana Boata, European economist at trade credit insurer Euler Hermes, the countries hardest hit by US tariffs will be the UK, with annual losses of $1.4bn, followed by France, Germany, Spain and Ireland.\n\n\u201cWe estimate the new sanctions will result in an $8.6bn annual export loss for the EU,\u201d she wrote in a report. And Boata predicts the Europeans are unlikely to accept the tariffs passively. \u201cWe expect Brussels to retaliate with duties on up $20bn of goods and a decision from the WTO is expected next March,\u201d she added.\n\nBack at Tea & Sympathy, Kavanagh-Dowsett reeled off his favorite British brands that will be affected, including the shoemakers Grenson and John Lobb. Two years ago, the store initiated a PR war with Hershey\u2019s after the confectioner insisted they sell US versions of its most popular UK chocolate bars.\n\nIn that instance, Kavanagh-Dowsett said, the chocolate maker backed down after receiving an avalanche of bad publicity. He said the store was gearing up for another campaign. \u201cWe\u2019re British for a living at this stage. Just the hike in chocolate is going to impact so many people,\u201d he said.", "description": "UK expected to be hit hardest by Trump\u2019s latest tariffs after the 25% tax on $7.5bn of goods is set to start against the EU", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78920b2215bd555d9d78c8c44d9135e8db22aeb6/0_76_4973_2983/master/4973.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a71a684b1af83e720d7b0c4cae1180fc", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
