(See the full segment above.)\n\nIn a segment on \u201cToday\u201d with Craig Melvin, Jordan sipped tequila and noted that the all-time list of players he would want to play with in a pickup game remains Hakeem Olajuwon, Magic Johnson, Scottie Pippen and James Worthy, Sports Illustrated reported.\n\n\u201cSo, Steph Curry shouldn\u2019t be offended when he watches this?\u201d Melvin asked.\n\n\u201cI hope not. He\u2019s still a great player. Not a Hall of Famer yet, though,\u201d Jordan replied. \u201cHe\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nMJ says Steph Curry isn\u2019t a Hall of Famer. pic.twitter.com/diQyNi75dk \u2014 TheWarriorsTalk (@TheWarriorsTalk) October 22, 2019\n\nJordan, arguably the reigning G.O.A.T. of basketball, was smiling \u2015 at the notion that he touched a nerve and provoked a Twitter meltdown?\n\nCurry\u2019s accomplishments offer a strong argument for the Basketball Hall of Fame, even if his career were to end today: In 10 seasons, he\u2019s a two-time MVP, three-time NBA champ and six-time All-Star Game selection. He averages 23.5 points a game and shoots a strong 43.6 percent from beyond the arc (and some of his 3-pointers are really long-range) and 90.5 percent from the free-throw line.\n\nThe floor is yours, Twitter:\n\nMichael Jordan must be smoking them e-cigarettes. I don\u2019t even really want to entertain this ridiculousness. Stephen Curry would be first ballot Hall of Fame\u2019er today!

But watch fans say that he's just still 'ultra competitive.'\n\n\n\nSteph Curry could have missed 2 seasons and retired yesterday and still be a Hall of Famer.\n\npic.twitter.com/UVyIkFuH8b \u2014 Justin (@SoCalJCred) October 22, 2019\n\nMaybe Michael Jordan was being playful, I don't know. But it's absurd, based on precedent, to suggest former @DavidsonMBB superstar @StephenCurry30 hasn't already done more than enough in the NBA to end up in the Hall of Fame: https://t.co/juxRoNIa43 \u2014 Rick Bonnell (@rick_bonnell) October 22, 2019\n\nSo, Michael Jordan doesn\u2019t think Steph Curry is a HOFer currently...this is the guy that has been evaluating talent for the Hornets \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d no wonder they\u2019ve been bad for years pic.twitter.com/3pjj8jGlUB \u2014 DailySportsDosage (@OfficalDSD) October 22, 2019\n\nSteph Curry looking at Michael Jordan. pic.twitter.com/8peg6jIyf9 \u2014 Cameron Grant (@IAmCoolerCam101) October 22, 2019", "description": "The retired NBA great might have gone out of bounds in his \"Today\" interview.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daf2751210000ab21ad3924.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
