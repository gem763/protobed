Two days earlier, the Senators took a seemingly commanding 3-1 series lead behind a complete-game shutout by Walter Johnson, who pitched the final five innings in agony after straining his leg trying to stretch a single into a double.\n\nAD\n\nDespite his injury, the Senators planned to turn to Johnson in Game 7 at Forbes Field.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHis leg still hurts,\u201d Senators Manager Bucky Harris told reporters after Game 6. \u201cBut gosh, he don\u2019t pitch with his leg. All we need is that good right arm of his and he\u2019s ready to give us that.\u201d\n\nPirates Manager Bill McKechnie was confident his team would prevail.\n\n\u201cI told you I thought we\u2019d win, and I kept telling you that when we were losing and things looked darkest,\u201d he said ahead of Game 7. \u201cThings are brighter now, but I\u2019m telling you again, we\u2019ll win the series, because I feel we\u2019ll beat them tomorrow, Johnson or no Johnson. He\u2019s the only man they have to face us. And don\u2019t think he\u2019ll look any too good out there tomorrow. He\u2019ll need everything he ever had to beat us, and I don\u2019t think he can go into the box that way, with only two days of rest.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll beat \u2018em sure tomorrow,\u201d Pittsburgh first baseman Stuffy McInnis said. \u201cWe have them on the run now and we\u2019re in better trim than they are. We\u2019ll beat \u2018em sure. Just wait and see.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGame 7 was scheduled for Oct. 14. The night before, Senators team president Clark Griffith lost the diamond out of his 1924 World Series ring at Pittsburgh\u2019s Morrowfield hotel. A bellhop discovered it lying on the floor of a corridor and returned it to Griffith, who showed his appreciation \u2014 and his proclivity for superstition \u2014 by inviting the young man to Game 7. The 2019 Nationals have lucky promotional sunglasses. The 1925 Senators had a lucky bellhop.\n\n\u201cThe Morrowfield today was without one perfectly good bellhop, while another mascot accompanied the Nats to Forbes Field,\u201d The Washington Post reported. \u201cAnd, needless to say, he will be right back there in the same capacity tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGriffith was convinced the boy had a role in getting Game 7 postponed by due to rain, which gave Johnson an extra day to heal. Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, baseball\u2019s commissioner, took his sweet time making the decision to push the game back a day.\n\n\u201cBy the time he decided it would be impossible to play, everybody else had been convinced for half an hour, and the field was in such shape that the most appropriate announcement that could have been made was that Annette Kellerman would take a high dive off the flag pole in center field,\u201d The Post reported.\n\n\u201cI figure that we got a mighty good break today when the weatherman butted in and washed out the game,\u201d Roger Peckinpaugh, the American League MVP, wrote in a column for The Post the following day. \u201cWe were scheduled to work Walter Johnson on the mound, and our fate in the series depended upon the performance of the Old Master.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCan you imagine waking up this morning to Anthony Rendon\u2019s byline on the front of the Sports section? Senators star Goose Goslin also penned a piece that ran in The Post on the day of the rescheduled Game 7. The left fielder used his space to address newspaper reports that Pirates catcher Earl Smith had managed to get his goat with various antics behind the plate when Goslin came to bat during the series.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of apple sauce,\u201d Goslin wrote. \u201cSmith simply is one of these \u2018funny boys\u2019 who gets a big kick out of trying to get smiles from the crowd. His imitation of flopping of wings, goose calls and such seem to have worried others worse than it has me. I think my batting record, which includes three home runs and a double out of my seven hits, proves that his antics have not upset me much. The fact is that I have been kidded by experts and have paid absolutely no attention to Earl\u2019s amateurish efforts.\u201d\n\nGoslin noted that Griffith, the Senators\u2019 president, had complained to commissioner Landis \u201con the grounds that Smith\u2019s actions take away from the dignity of the game\u201d and might lead to a fight or riot. \u201cI can promise one thing,\u201d Goslin wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t intend to start any trouble.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWho wouldn\u2019t read 500 words by Juan Soto on how carrying one\u2019s bat to first base after a home run is actually good for the game?\n\nGoslin concluded his column by expressing confidence in Johnson, the Senators\u2019 37-year-old ace, who earned the win in relief during Washington\u2019s 4-3 triumph over the New York Giants in Game 7 of the World Series in 1924.\n\n\u201cThat old boy is great when the stakes are big and I do not know of any bigger pot for him to shoot at than the one now at stake,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe will be right in there tomorrow and with a little help from us \u2014 which I guarantee he\u2019ll get \u2014 should come home with the bacon.\u201d\n\nBefore the game, Landis met with Harris, Peckinpaugh and Senators catcher Muddy Ruel, and demanded that they publicly apologize for criticizing the umpiring earlier in the series.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGoslin and the Senators staked Johnson to a 4-0 lead in the first inning of Game 7, but it wasn\u2019t enough for the injured hurler in Washington\u2019s eventual 9-7 loss. If only he had the benefit of a cortisone shot as the Nationals\u2019 Game 7 starter, Max Scherzer, did after being scratched with neck spasms before Game 5 on Sunday.\n\nAmid low-hanging clouds and smoke that \u201cspread a misty curtain over the playing field,\u201d Johnson allowed nine runs, five of them earned, on 15 hits, including nine for extra bases, over eight innings. Kiki Cuyler\u2019s two-run double in the eighth was the deciding blow.\n\n\u201cThrough it all he stood like a giant oak,\u201d The Post\u2019s N.W. Baxter reported. \u201cOutwardly there was no sign of the weakness that was within. He pitched with the calmness and deliberation of a man intent upon his task. There was nothing to show that he heard the jeers and hooting of the crowd. There was no sign that told of the pain he suffered. But all of these things told, for under a sky that would have served him best had he been in full possession of his powers, he could not check the flood of hits that almost matched the rain drops as they fell.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "An injured Walter Johnson took the mound for the Senators at Pittsburgh\u2019s Forbes Field.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
