Teenagers at the Parkville Youth Justice Centre have reportedly launched more than 200 assaults on staff in just eight months. Violent incidents have become the biggest source of employee injury at Parkville.\n\nA Victorian youth justice facility has been locked down since this morning over staff fears following a series of assaults.\n\nStaff at the Malmsbury Youth Justice Centre, 95km northwest of Melbourne, locked youth offenders inside their cells and in their units while they met with management from 11.30am.\n\nWorkSafe was called in and representatives are also meeting with staff, according to Julian Kennelly from the Community and Public Sector Union.\n\n\u201cStaff are still on site, it is a cease-work,\u201d he told news.com.au. \u201cStaff had a morning meeting and were asked if they felt safe and they thought it was unsafe.\u201d\n\nHe said staff were negotiating for more emergency response personnel.\n\nIt follows two attacks on prison staff at the facility on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nLast year, a female staff member at Malmsbury was \u201cscalped\u201d by a teenage offender who swing a guitar at her head with such force it left a 12cm-wide wound on her hairline.\n\nShe didn\u2019t see the guitar coming and was knocked out cold before she hit the ground, staff members say. She has not returned to work.\n\nWARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGE BELOW\n\nVictoria\u2019s Opposition Leader Michael O\u2019Brien said Malmsbury was \u201ca disaster area\u201d and that Premier Daniel Andrews had \u201clost control of the youth justice system\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to urgently step in, make sure the staff are safe, make sure these young offenders are not allowed to continue with this sort of behaviour,\u201d he said.\n\nNews.com.au last month reported on Victoria\u2019s other out-of-control youth justice centre at Parkville on Melbourne\u2019s fringe.\n\nStaff members who spoke on condition of anonymity said they were worried there would be a death at the Parkville Youth Justice Precinct if more staff weren\u2019t called in to help.\n\n\u201cIn 48 hours, we\u2019ve had five staff assaults,\u201d one staff member said. \u201cThree were physically injured. One was spat at in the face. One had a missile thrown at him.\u201d\n\nA source claims that of 53 \u201cfrontline\u201d staff hired during an induction in April, only four remain in the job. The source also claims there are more than 125 staff receiving WorkCover right now. A Corrections Victoria spokesman would not be drawn on these figures and declined to answer questions about why staff turnover was so high.\n\n\u201cYou get more stacking shelves at Coles,\u201d a staff member said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming in at $22 an hour. They think they\u2019re going to be able to do actual youth work and change the world. They don\u2019t get the chance.\u201d\n\nAnother staff member said 260 staff had been assaulted between July 2018 and June 2019.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very surprised there hasn\u2019t been a fatality,\u201d he said.\n\nNews.com.au has approached the Department of Justice and Community Safety for comment.", "description": "A Victorian youth justice facility has been locked down since this morning over staff fears following a series of assaults.", "authors": ["Rohan Smith"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/422dfef0656e2840792e771ce31abbcf?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
