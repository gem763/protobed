So with the possibility of the U.K. leaving the European Union in a so-called hard manner at the end of October \u2014 that the British government itself says could lead to shortages of medicine and food \u2014 analysts say the Bank of England isn\u2019t in a situation to either boost, or restrict, demand.\n\n\u201cThe Bank of England is not expected to change inflation rates from 0.75% and the market appears to have accepted the current rate. But markets appear to be less focused on the BoE and more concentrated on potential changes coming out of the Houses of Parliament,\u201d said Shamik Dhar, chief economist at BNY Mellon Investment Management.\n\nStill, the central bank has said it is planning to hike interest rates afterwards if Brexit doesn\u2019t derail the economy too much.\n\n\u201cIf the UK does leave the European Union on 31st October without a deal, UK growth is likely to suffer \u2013 if the BoE\u2019s goal is financial stability, it would be hard to justify a rate hold, let alone hike. So far the BoE\u2019s forecasts are based on the assumption of an orderly Brexit, but they have made no public change to this in light of the ever-growing likelihood of a hard exit,\u201d said Ben Lord, fixed interest manager at M&G Investments.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what to expect when its latest interest-rate decision is announced at 7 a.m. Eastern, or noon local time, on Thursday.:\n\nAnalyst View Bank of America Merrill Lynch \u201cThe Bank of England should leave policy on hold this week and sound a bit less dovish, but we still expect the next move to be a cut.\u201d Barclays \u201cThe MPC will most likely remain neutral and largely keep the tone unchanged. On the margin, they may strike a more dovish tone.\u201d Citi `The MPC would probably resume the rate hike cycle if Parliament agreed a Brexit deal and might even accelerate it if citizens voted to stay in the EU in a second referendum. If the UK leaves without a deal, the Bank would cut Bank Rate to the lower bound, in our view. As the MPC waits for the sovereign to make up its mind, we expect a unanimous vote to keep Bank Rate at 0.75% and all other policy settings steady at the 19 September meeting.\u201d Goldman Sachs \u201cWe expect the MPC to vote unanimously in favour of no change in monetary policy. The September meeting is not accompanied by any medium-term macroeconomic projections.\u201d Morgan Stanley \u201cWe expect a 9-0 vote for rates on hold on this non-inflation report meeting.\u201d Nomura \u201cContinued uncertainty about Brexit and a slowing global economy are being pitted against signs of rising domestic inflationary pressures. As a result, the Bank is likely to keep policy on hold in the near term.\u201d TD Bank \u201cIn August, the BOE said that in order to raise rates, it would not only need to see a smooth Brexit, as previously assumed, but also \u201csome recovery in global growth.\u201d We\u2019ve seen no sign of that happening yet, and global growth seems to still be heading in the opposite direction. So for now, the BOE can continue to sit back and watch the Brexit show unfold.\u201d\n\nThe FTSE 100 UKX, -0.09% has climbed nearly 9% this year while the British pound GBPUSD, +0.0561% has declined more than 2% vs. the U.S. dollar.", "description": "Here\u2019s a look at what to expect when the Bank of England\u2019s latest interest-rate decision is announced at 7 a.m. Eastern on Thursday.", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR527_carney_ZG_20190918104026.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
