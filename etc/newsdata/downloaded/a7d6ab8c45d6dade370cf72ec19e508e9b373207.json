It also is the start of a run in which the 62,000-seat stadium will host a pair of NFL games yearly for the next decade.\n\nThis is \"a long-term symbol of the NFL's commitment to London and the size of the NFL's fan base and energy in the UK,\" said Chris Halpin, the NFL's chief strategy and growth officer.\n\nThere will also be two games at Wembley Stadium, which the NFL has used since they started playing in London in 2007. The NFL claims a 15 million-strong fan base in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn recent years, the NFL has moved some of the London games to 9:30 AM eastern time to give it a full national audience. Last year\u2019s Eagles-Jaguars game there earned a 2.2 rating and 3.59 million viewers on NFL Network, up slightly in ratings and four percent in viewership from Vikings-Browns in the same early morning window last year (2.1, 3.45M).\n\nThough it was up for that time, the Eagles\u2019 win was the lowest rated and least-watched NFL telecast of the season. That was the only specific rating because, since the London games are at 1 p.m. eastern \u2013 as one of many on CBS and FOX nationally at that time \u2013 it is hard to single out what the one-game viewership was.\n\nThe Bears-Raiders matchup is the 25th regular-season game the NFL has played across the pond, and the first played outside the U.S. in a stadium built for American football in addition to soccer.\n\nAs the league celebrates its 100th season, it continues to expand its foreign footprint with five international games in 2019, with one in Mexico as well. That game will feature the Kansas City Chiefs and Los Angeles Rams.\n\nThat one will come with a lot of meaning as the NFL returns to the country after it was forced to move last season's Chiefs-Rams game from Mexico to Los Angeles because of poor field conditions at Azteca Stadium.\n\nThe NFL has also hosted three games in Mexico City and six in Toronto.\n\nThe interesting thing about the 33 games the NFL has held outside the U.S. is that it has only featured two winning teams facing each other, and that was when the 7-2 Raiders faced the 6-3 Texans in Mexico in 2016.\n\nPart of it is due to the fact that the NFL sends to London its smaller markets to act as the \u201chome team,\u201d which has mostly been the Jacksonville Jaguars and continues with the Raiders this time.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe NFL\u2019s international outreach began on Oct. 2, 2005, when Robert Griffith sprinted out of a giant inflatable helmet at Mexico's famed Azteca Stadium screaming and wildly waving a Mexican flag as he charged through smoke and a corridor of cheerleaders.103,467 fans packed Mexico's largest stadium for the first regular-season game outside the United States, which Arizona won 31-14 over San Francisco.\n\nMexico, which has a major NFL fan base, had previously hosted preseason games, including when a record 112,376 fans attended a Cowboys-Oilers preseason game in 1994.\n\nThis year marks the 13th consecutive season that the league is playing multiple international games.\n\nThe NFL had staged a handful of exhibition games abroad, starting with the Bears' 16-7 win over the Giants on Aug. 15, 1960, at Varsity Stadium in Toronto.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The NFL is kicking off one of their annual games in London on Sunday with a unique twist.", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/NFL-GettyImages-1167116582.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
