He was 23 of 32 for 338 yards and two touchdowns - a 92-yarder to Anderson and a 5-yarder to Ryan Griffin - and an interception.\n\nThe Jets put up 382 yards of total offense against the Cowboys after getting 233 combined in the last two games with practice squad player-turned-starter Luke Falk at quarterback.\n\nIt all resulted in New York\u2019s first win of the season, and first under coach Adam Gase.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to just continue to work out the details,\u201d Darnold said of the offense. \u201cObviously, we got the win, which was awesome. Our defense played great. We played good at times, but there\u2019s a lot of things we can clean up.\n\n\u201cI think we left a lot of points on the field.\u201d\n\nStill, it was a huge positive step after the Jets - particularly the offense - barely resembled an NFL-caliber squad during Darnold\u2019s absence.\n\nIt was also proof that New York isn\u2019t exactly the bunch that people were making fun of the past three games during losses to Cleveland, New England and Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to build off each week, good or bad,\u201d Gase said. \u201cThose three weeks where Sam was out, those were some tough learning experiences for us. \u2026 We really didn\u2019t give ourselves much of a chance.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nEverything, for the most part, seemed to be clicking with Darnold back in action. A big key was the offensive line, which was maligned for much of the first four games. It\u2019s still a work in progress as Gase tinkers with personnel, but the five big guys up front gave Darnold ample time to make plays against Dallas, and his ability to quickly improvise certainly helped.\n\nAfter allowing an NFL-leading 23 sacks through four games, the Jets\u2019 offensive line gave up just two - both by Robert Quinn - against the Cowboys.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe running game. It seems silly to say that with Le\u2019Veon Bell leading the way, but the Jets are averaging just 64 yards rushing per game. That ranks them 30th in the league, ahead of Miami (58.2) and Cincinnati (56.5).\n\nBell has run for 256 yards as a workhorse out of the backfield on 85 carries. But that\u2019s good for only a 3.0 average. With Darnold back and defenses unable to constantly stack the box anymore while not fearing New York\u2019s passing game, Bell and the rest of the Jets\u2019 backfield should start seeing some running lanes.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nAnderson. The speedy receiver was mostly a non-factor through the first four games, catching 11 passes for 131 yards and no touchdowns.\n\nHe broke out with five receptions for 125 yards, including the 92-yard touchdown, in the win over Dallas. Having that deep threat is a huge key to the Jets\u2019 success by keeping defenses honest.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nLeonard Williams. The defensive lineman\u2019s name has come up in trade rumors, and Gase did little to defuse them. Teams are asking about him, but the Jets aren\u2019t actively shopping him - although a deal by the Oct. 29 deadline isn\u2019t out of the question.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t deal in the hypotheticals,\u201d Gase said, adding that GM Joe Douglas and his staff frequently get calls about players and potential trades and signings.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had any of those conversations, so I don\u2019t know what other teams are thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cBut right now, I like the way that our guys are rolling. Anything\u2019s always possible. Right now, I like how our team is.\u201d\n\nWilliams, the No. 6 overall pick in 2015, has no sacks this season and just two in his last 16 games.\n\nINJURED\n\nLeft tackle Kelvin Beachum has a sprained ankle that could sideline him a few games. Brandon Shell, formerly the starting right tackle, replaced him against Dallas and could do so while he\u2019s out. \u2026 Linebacker C.J. Mosley has missed the last four games with a groin injury, but Gase expressed optimism that he could return to practice this week. \u2026 Defensive end Henry Anderson (shoulder), cornerback Nate Hairston (knee), linebacker Neville Hewitt (stinger) and nose tackle Steve McLendon (hamstring) are day to day.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n92 - With his 92-yard touchdown toss to Anderson, Darnold became the youngest player in the Super Bowl era - at 22 years, 30 days old - to throw a TD pass of 90 or more yards. It was also the longest play from scrimmage in the NFL this season.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Jets got their first win but take on AFC East rival - and undefeated - Patriots on Monday night. They\u2019ll be hard-pressed to pull off a two-game winning streak but should fare better than the 30-14 loss in New England three weeks ago with Falk making his first NFL start.\n\n\u201cIt was good for the guys to go through it and see here\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now,\u201d Gase said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get better fast. We\u2019re not going to have a lot of room for error. We\u2019ve got a tough opponent coming up this week, so we have to do a good job of finding a way of just getting better this week.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sam Darnold's presence alone gave the New York Jets an immediate lift.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dennis Waszak Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/cowboys_jets_football_40509_c0-99-2388-1492_s1200x700.jpg?175f2c7968df0b5ca71cdf33a76ccbc12d9b6008", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
