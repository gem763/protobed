I would often tell the story of too many hard workers found dead at their desks,\" said the man, who lives in Florida with his wife of 50 years. \"Then I quote William Bernstein: 'When you've won the game, stop playing.'\"\n\nTo find out whether his clients' investments were in shape for retirement, he'd ask them: \"Do you need to get rich or do you need to STAY rich?\"\n\n\"If they truly needed to still get rich, then they need to stay invested to a large extent in common stocks and hope there will not be an extended huge decline in the stock market just when they start withdrawing their recommended 4% annually,\" he said. For those who hadn't yet reached their nest egg goal, investing in stocks through index exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could provide a high potential return.\n\n\"However, if they need to STAY rich, then they need to greatly reduce or eliminate their exposure to common stocks,\" he said. That meant relying more on fixed-income investments and some passive investing in index funds in order to preserve their wealth.\n\nNeed help with your plan?

At the time, about 5% of his and his wife's nest egg was in cash, 35% in fixed-income products (bonds and annuities), and 60% in equities (dividend ETFs). The man waited to claim Social Security until age 70 to get the maximum payout, and he gets distributions from a pension plan. They plan to self-fund future long-term care, which can be a large expense.\n\n\"If you have won the game, but you persist in your habit of being exposed to common stocks when the market is at a new all-time high and the economic expansion is in uncharted territory, then you run the unnecessary risk of a prolonged downturn in both the economy and the stock market,\" he said.\n\nHe continued: \"What is the point of taking unnecessary risks and blowing up your retirement? Do you want to risk having to go back to work and/or greatly reducing your lifestyle? If you won the game, get out of stocks and into principal preservation of fixed income.\"", "description": "To find out whether his clients' investments were in shape for retirement, he'd ask whether they wanted to grow their wealth or preserve it.", "authors": ["Tanza Loudenback"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db7595adee019586208d486?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
