We are not career politicians. We are veterans of the military and of the nation\u2019s defense and intelligence agencies. Our service is rooted in the defense of our country on the front lines of national security\u2026\n\nThe president of the United States may have used his position to pressure a foreign country into investigating a political opponent, and he sought to use U.S. taxpayer dollars as leverage to do it. He allegedly sought to use the very security assistance dollars appropriated by Congress to create stability in the world, to help root out corruption and to protect our national security interests, for his own personal gain. These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent. We also know that on Sept. 9, the inspector general for the intelligence community notified Congress of a \u201ccredible\u201d and \u201curgent\u201d whistleblower complaint related to national security and potentially involving these allegations. Despite federal law requiring the disclosure of this complaint to Congress, the administration has blocked its release to Congress\u2026\n\nIf these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense. We do not arrive at this conclusion lightly, and we call on our colleagues in Congress to consider the use of all congressional authorities available to us, including the power of \u201cinherent contempt\u201d and impeachment hearings, to address these new allegations, find the truth and protect our national security.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cisneros Etal", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Seven-Freshman-Democrats-These-Allegations-Are-Threat-All-We-Have-Sworn-Protect"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
