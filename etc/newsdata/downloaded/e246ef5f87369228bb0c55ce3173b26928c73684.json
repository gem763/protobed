But Trump's vows to deport \"millions\" already living in the country haven't yet become a reality.\n\n\u201cNext week ICE will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States,\u201d Trump tweeted in June. \u201cThey will be removed as fast as they come in.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Trump administration removed 256,085 unauthorized immigrants from the country. The agency has repeatedly attempted to convince local law enforcement to back its enforcement efforts. The number of unauthorized immigrants removed by ICE hit 409,849 in 2013 under Obama, according to government data.\n\nAlbence also pointed to a September ruling by a federal judge in California which blocks ICE from using certain information in criminal databases, including fingerprints, to make arrests.\n\nAlthough the agency has eliminated Obama-era enforcement priorities that targeted dangerous criminals first, the vast majority of the unauthorized immigrants removed in the past year have criminal records, Albence said.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time Albence has taken the podium in recent weeks, flanked by local sheriffs from across the country, and criticizing the local police departments he said aren\u2019t cooperating with his agents.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a middle ground for public safety,\u201d Albence said.\n\nThe chief immigration enforcer said Thursday heightened rhetoric from Democratic politicians continued to cause problems for public safety. But ICE\u2019s critics, and even some law enforcement professionals, place the blame on the White House.\n\n\u201cOur interior enforcement efforts have been less focused and less effective,\u201d John Cohen, a former career official with the Homeland Security Department, said. \u201cThis administration has focused increasing on non-criminal aliens.\u201d\n\nCohen\u2019s assessment is reflected in recent data. About 15,000 fewer criminal aliens were arrested this year compared to last, as Albence said Thursday.\n\n\u201cTheir approach and rhetoric has created a wedge between law enforcement agencies across the country,\u201d Cohen said.", "description": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed about 260,000 unauthorized immigrants over the past year, according to two ICE officials.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/ice-agent-file-gty-jef-190205_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
