In the process her legs were scratched, bleeding and she was screaming in pain,' she said.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nKatie Dowling's two-year-old daughter was left with dozens of bloodied scratches from the surface of a local public pool\n\nKatie Dowling said that after recent renovations, the kids play pool's new surface has 'the consistency of sandpaper'\n\n'She wasn't doing anything wrong. She entered the pool as any child that size would do.'\n\nThe concerned mother said that after recent renovations, the kids play pool's new surface has 'the consistency of sandpaper' on its sides.\n\n'I believe (the aquatic centre) needs to review their choice of surface in the kids area to prevent further injuries occurring,' she said.\n\n'My daughter is still in quite a bit of pain and I\u2019m hoping her legs heal quickly.'\n\n'She kept poking her legs out saying \"ouch, ouch\",' she told 7 News.\n\nBut Ms Dowling's daughter isn't the first child that the public pool has injured since its recent $5.4million upgrade.\n\nVicky Cozens' seven-year-old daughter (pictured) was also left in pain after falling on the bottom of the Burpengary Regional Aquatic Leisure Centre pool in April\n\nVicky Cozens told Daily Mail Australia that her seven-year-old daughter was in pain after falling on the bottom of the pool in April.\n\n'It all happened within seconds really,' she said.\n\n'She slipped walking in the shallow part. We have been there many times over the years before the renovations and had no injuries.\n\n'What ever they have used is very nasty'.\n\nMichelle Doyle Kennedy's kids also had a similar experience at the public pool.\n\n'This is exactly what's happened to all the kids! They got cuts all over their arms and legs too from there,' she said.\n\nMoreton Bay Regional Council reopened the pool in February this year after undertaking the major renovations.\n\nA council spokesman told Daily Mail Australia that slip-resistant surfacing has been used to try to prevent fall-related injuries.\n\n'We understand the concerns that have been raised with the slip-resistant surface that\u2019s been used at the pool,' the statement read.\n\n'Council officers have spoken with the girl\u2019s mother and committed to reviewing the type of surface that\u2019s been used.'\n\nMs Dowling suggested the council set up warning signs, as well as changing the surface to something less rough.", "description": "Katie Dowling's two-year-old daughter's legs were scratched and bloodied from the harsh floor of a pool at the\u00a0Burpengary Regional Aquatic Leisure Centre near Brisbane.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/02/20357542-0-image-a-22_1572402906492.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
