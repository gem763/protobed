Fidelity CEO Wahl Bartmann said there was a large difference between what employees were demanding and what the South African National Security Employers' Association (SANSEA) was prepared to offer.\n\nThe private security industry in South Africa employs some half a million officers, compared to under 200 000 police officers, Fin24 also reported.\n\nCompiled by Marelise van der Merwe", "description": "Wage negotiations in the private security sector remain deadlocked and unions are heading to the CCMA to declare a dispute, they said in a statement on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9048/5d915d56e2874fbcacb250afed32643e.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
