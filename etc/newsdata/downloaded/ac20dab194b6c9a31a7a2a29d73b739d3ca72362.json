For three years he led this nation\u2019s fight against terror in all its ever-changing technological forms.\n\nSo it is a little concerning that in that time nobody got round to briefing him on what it is that a television camera and a lapel microphone actually do.\n\nIndeed he has every right to feel let down by the department, the Ministry of Defence, to be exact, that he now runs.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSomeone, really, should have let him know, that if you have consented to the wearing of a microphone, and are standing in the full glare of a television news camera, it is not, perhaps the most auspicious time for some light-hearted small talk that will fatally undermine your own government\u2019s 48-hour media lying strategy.\n\nOnly the day before, there had been Boris Johnson, grinning his way through claims that he was absolutely, definitely, only proroguing parliament to get on with his minority government\u2019s \u201cnew, exciting legislative agenda\u201d, absolutely none of which can possibly pass through the House of Commons.\n\nAnd then, on Thursday morning, there was Jacob Rees-Mogg on the Today programme, still unable to get his fob watch back in his pocket after his trip to Balmoral to see the Queen, claiming that the longest suspension of parliament since 1945 was in fact \u201croutine\u201d and \u201cquite boring\u201d.\n\nSo what was Ben Wallace doing, the fifth most senior minister in the cabinet, at a meeting in Helsinki, telling his French counterpart that, in fact, this whole prorogation thing really was all about Brexit?\n\n\u201cParliament has been very good at saying what it doesn\u2019t want but it has been awful at saying what it wants. That\u2019s the reality,\u201d he told her, over a polite chuckle.\n\n\u201cSo you know any leader has to, you know, try. I don\u2019t know what the outcome of it will be. Oh... politics.\u201d\n\nOh, politics indeed... lol. Politics, which in the UK has come to mean little more than the industrialisation of lying. Just what will the outcome be? Who knows? Ben Wallace certainly doesn\u2019t.\n\nIndeed, how did Mr Wallace not come by the memo? Which is to say, if you\u2019re a Tory cabinet minister, whenever you spot a TV camera, whatever you do, don\u2019t tell the truth.\n\nIt\u2019s not like this is a new diktat either. It certainly predates the Boris Johnson era.\n\nThe news programmes have not struggled, in the last 24 hours, to dig up all sorts of footage of all kinds of Tories, looking into a television camera and telling all kinds of porkies.\n\nThere\u2019s one of Matt Hancock, from just a few months ago, saying prorogation of parliament would be an affront to the men who died at Dunkirk, and, he adds, with staccato certainty, \u201cI. Will. Not. Have. It.\u201d\n\nExcept, it turns out, he will have it. Because he\u2019s not resigned, he\u2019s still in the cabinet, and parliament\u2019s very much still being prorogued.\n\nThere\u2019s Amber Rudd, sitting on Hastings pier, saying it would be \u201coutrageous to consider proroguing parliament. We are not Stuart kings\u201d. And yet, she\u2019s only gone and done it.\n\nThere\u2019s Sajid Javid, at the Tory leadership hustings, saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t deliver democracy by trashing democracy.\u201d He\u2019s the chancellor of the exchequer now and somehow, by way of a miracle really, it has become trashed.\n\nThere\u2019s Michael Gove, Andrea Leadsom, Nicky Morgan. Anyway, I could go on for some time but we\u2019ll limit it to just one more, kind of crucial one.\n\nDominic Cummings, the Brexit brain egg, the man whose great genius is the altar on which the reputation of the country must be laid. The Oracle. The post-politics politician. The guy who is, let\u2019s face it, too clever for democracy.\n\nThe great visionary who has emerged from his long years buried in Thucydides\u2019 History of the Peloponnesian War only to find he has slipped the surly bonds of Other People\u2019s Opinions, not to say, the British parliamentary system.\n\nIt\u2019s just that I could have sworn I saw him wandering out of his house three weeks ago, Vote Leave tote bag over his shoulder, reactolite lenses blackening under the glare from his own soul, stopping to tell Sky News that, \u201cPoliticians don\u2019t get to choose which votes they respect. That\u2019s the critical issue.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed it is the critical issue. It is the uncertain foundation of our way of life. And yet, this country had a general election in 2017. It was fully informed by the EU referendum that had occurred a year before it. Theresa May went around the country, telling the voters with terrifying singularity to \u201cstrengthen my hand in the negotiations with Brussels\u201d.\n\nAnd the voters declined to do it. They returned a hung parliament, one that will not sanction a no-deal Brexit, so Cummings and Johnson have had a think. They\u2019ve decided they know best and chucked it out.\n\nBut at least we can know that Cummings got the memo.\n\n\u201cPoliticians don\u2019t get to choose which votes they respect. That is the critical issue.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not as grand a lie as the rest. It may even have been a mere oversight, which we are only too glad to correct. Politicians don\u2019t get to choose which votes they respect, apart from me.", "description": "Ben Wallace was the longest-serving security minister in this country\u2019s history.
