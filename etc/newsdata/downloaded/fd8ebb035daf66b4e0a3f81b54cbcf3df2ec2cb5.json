REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nChina\u2019s central bank said it would reduce the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, releasing a total of 900 billion yuan ($126.35 billion) in liquidity.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s nonfarm payroll data is likely to show that the U.S. economy added 158,000 jobs in August, compared with a gain of 164,000 in July, according to a Reuters survey of economists.\n\nThe monthly report, due at 8:30 a.m ET, will be closely watched after a clutch of economic data from earlier this week provided mixed views on the U.S. economy amid the drama of a drawn-out trade war with China.\n\nData showing a contraction in U.S. factory activity in August dampened markets on Tuesday, but diffusing political tensions in Hong Kong and hopes of a de-escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions helped boost stocks to one-month highs later in the week.\n\nMarkets were also driven by strong growth in private payrolls and an accelerating services sector. The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX rose 1.3% on Thursday, closing just 1.75% away from its record high in July.\n\nAnalysts have said that weak jobs numbers could put more pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by as much as 50-basis points in its mid-September meeting. Market participants are currently expecting a quarter percentage point cut.\n\nAt 7:08 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 84 points, or 0.31%. S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 8.75 points, or 0.29% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 15.5 points, or 0.2%.\n\nInvestors will also keep a close eye on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s speech at the University of Zurich, scheduled for 12:30 p.m. ET, which could provide further hints on the monetary policy before the central bank goes into a quiet period ahead of its Sept. 17-18 meeting.\n\nAmong stocks, Marathon Oil (MRO.N) was down 1.8% after Goldman Sachs cut its price target on the stock. Facebook Inc (FB.O) also fell marginally following a Wall Street Journal report that state attorneys general are formally launching separate antitrust probes into the company.", "description": "U.S. stock index futures edged higher on Friday ahead of a crucial jobs report and as China rolled out a stimulus plan to shore up its flagging economy.", "authors": ["Uday Sampath Kumar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426895795&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8512T", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
