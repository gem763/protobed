A local newspaper reporter came to cover the wedding. The first question the reporter asked was: \u201cDon\u2019t you think the sex will lead to premature death?\u201d\n\nThe groom replied: \u201cIf she dies, she dies\u201d.\n\nFred Isenberg, 75, broke into a broad grin as he told me the punch-line of this joke during a break in a tango dancing class he was taking with his wife Suzanne, 71.\n\nAs with all good humour, the joke is loosely inspired by reality.\n\nOne hundred of the residents of Sun City, Arizona, are over the age of 100, more than any other place in the world. Another 2,350 residents are over the age of 85.\n\nSun City was built in 1959 by entrepreneur Del Webb as America\u2019s first active retirement community, on cotton fields west of Phoenix.\n\nDel Webb predicted that retirees would flock to a community where they were given more than just a house with a rocking chair in which to sit and wait to die.\n\nToday\u2019s residents keep their minds and bodies active by socialising at over 120 clubs such as square dancing, ceramics, roller skating, computers, cheerleading, racquetball, silver craft, yoga, and stained glass. The seven recreation centres offer a multitude of sports and games for Sun City\u2019s 55-and-over population, in addition to golfing on the eleven courses.\n\nI met Dario Rossini, a slim 90-year-old former air force pilot, doing sit-ups in the gym one evening. He told me he does at least 100 sit-ups a day, and spends an hour in the gym four to five days a week to keep his muscles and joints healthy. As I watched, he moved to different gym machines to lift weights.\n\nAt a Saturday night dance Donald Smitherman, 98, swung his wife Marlene, 78 around the dance floor, before dipping her for a kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll be 99 in April, and I played 18 holes of golf today,\u201d he told me proudly.\n\nThe activity has tangible benefits, says Paul Herrmann, 67, Executive Director of the Sun City Visitors Center.\n\n\u201cFitness is huge,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know that with staving off heart disease and everything else. We stay active and our blood vessels will stay cleaner, we don\u2019t get the build-up in them.\n\n\u201cIf you talk to people in a traditional old people\u2019s home, 90+ percent of them will tell you what they used to do. That\u2019s all they have. Here in Sun City people are talking about what they\u2019re planning on doing, and what they\u2019re doing next.\u201d\n\nJohn Longo is looking forward to competing in the Masters Swimming National Championships in Cleveland this spring.\n\nLongo went to Coney Island to swim in the ocean as a boy growing up in Brooklyn. But the 88-year-old only learnt to swim competitively when he took swimming lessons to improve his stroke at one of the Sun City recreation centre pools. Now he wakes up at 5:30 a.m. six days a week to swim a mile.\n\nSun Citians don\u2019t avoid the wear and tear of old age, but a lot of them do seem to defy it.\n\n\u201cWe all have ailments of some kind,\u201d Ruth Pharris, 66, told me, before Donna Summer\u2019s \u201cHot Stuff\u201d started blaring from the stereo, and she joined the Sun City Poms cheerleading squad in a rehearsal for a performance they\u2019re doing in Laughlin, Nevada.\n\nVirginia Harvey, 103, was ballroom dancing until a few months ago, when she travelled to Las Vegas to dance in a competition, and injured herself falling in the parking lot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got arthritis all over so that\u2019s why I exercise in the water,\u201d says Barbara Miller, 77. Miller was joined by 90-year-old Inge Natoli for their three-times-a-week early morning synchronised swimming practice.\n\nNatoli emigrated from Germany to Michigan, and has lived in Sun City for 29 years. She put on a pink track suit after the swim, and hopped into her golf cart to go to take a woman who has cancer to the hospital.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the great thing about Sun City \u2013 everybody helps each other,\u201d commented Miller.\n\nSun City Visitors Center estimates 17,196 of its residents do some kind of volunteer work, saving the community roughly $34.5 million, and keeping property taxes down. There is a sheriff\u2019s posse, a street cleaning crew, and cheery seniors who take meals on wheels to housebound people.\n\nConstantine Moundalexis, 55, moved to Sun City from New Jersey to live next door to his ailing mother, Catherine Morgan, 82, who is confined to her bed.\n\n\u201cShe was a schoolteacher in New Jersey for many years, and raised three children all by herself,\u201d he says. A lot of good things this woman has done for us, and I\u2019m very grateful, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\n\n\u201cI know in Europe and different parts of the world, the older generation is taken in by the younger generation. They live with their parents and they take care of them directly.\n\n\u201cHere in this country we don\u2019t do that as much or as well. And that was something I did not want to see for my Mom.\u201d\n\nBalancing his mother\u2019s need for medication to take away the pain she feels when she is moved with the greater awareness she has when she is not knocked out by drugs is a daily struggle.\n\nDeath is a constant reminder in a community this old.\n\nPoignant love notes are attached to many of the headstones at the Sunland Memorial Park cemetery. A blanket of bouquets stretches to the horizon.\n\nSheriff\u2019s Posse Commander Arthur Jenkins says he see the same man come to the cemetery every day to be with his wife.\n\nMore than 20 percent of people are widowed. Women outnumber men by a ratio of about three to one.\n\nThe Sun City singles dance club every Friday averages 250 members, with as many as 400 at this time of year.\n\nBob Ralyon, 79, whose wife died 2 and a half years ago, was chatting to a table of ladies at a singles pot-luck.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re married for over 50 years, the word single sort of scares you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd some of these people, they\u2019re scared, they\u2019re lonely, they\u2019re not sure what they\u2019re going to do tomorrow. And this is a very good place to get them out to do things, when normally they would look at four walls, which is depressing. You can\u2019t do that, you\u2019ve got to get out there.\n\n\u201cYour marriage is now a memory, and there\u2019s a chance that there\u2019s someone out there special that you could \u2018hook up with\u2019. That\u2019s not my language, but it\u2019s the language of the kids today. So I\u2019m always looking!\u201d", "description": "Some 76 million people were born in the United States during the post-war baby boom from 1946 to 1964.
