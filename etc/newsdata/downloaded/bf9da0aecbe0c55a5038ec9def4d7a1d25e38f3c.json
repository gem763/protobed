REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins\n\nAround the country, in an overcast Buenos Aires, amid the Pampas farmlands and the vineyards of Mendoza, polling stations opened their doors at 8 a.m.\n\nVoting goes on until 6 p.m. (2100 GMT), with the first results expected a few hours later.\n\nThe ballot - which many have already called for Fernandez - is effectively a referendum between Macri\u2019s tough-love austerity and the \u201csocial contract\u201d of the left-leaning opposition, whose populism has lured voters, hurt badly by a snarling economic crisis.\n\nArgentina\u2019s choice could have far-reaching implications: it is one the world\u2019s top grain exporters, is stirring the energy world with its huge Vaca Muerta shale field and is on the cusp of restructuring talks with creditors over $100 billion in debt.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in play in this election are simply two opposing views of the country,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Luis Salom\u00f3n, mayor of farming town Saladillo, who is supporting Macri and holds out hope that he can force a second round.\n\nNot many agree.\n\nFernandez, a relative unknown until this year outside Argentine political circles, holds a 20-point lead in most opinion polls after thumping Macri in an August primary, a shock result that rattled markets as investors feared a populist political shift.\n\nThat result - and the sharp market crash that followed - radically altered the dynamic of the race, pushing the country further into economic crisis and making Macri the underdog in an election that most had thought would be a close-run affair.\n\nThe economy has taken centre stage with the country in the grip of recession for most of the last year, the outlook for growth darkening, annual inflation over 50%, job numbers down and poverty up sharply.\n\nNohelia Pol, 31, a trader in Buenos Aires said she was going to vote for Fernandez, saying he had \u201cfairer\u201d policies to help people across the social spectrum.\n\n\u201cI also hope that he will be able to get out country\u2019s economy going again a bit and get us out of the debt generated by our current president Macri.\u201d\n\nThe conservative incumbent won backers with plans to reform Argentina\u2019s notoriously closed economy with trade deals and a successful push to lure foreign investment into energy projects and infrastructure.\n\nMacri\u2019s reforms plans, however, were badly hit in 2018 when a currency and debt crisis forced him to strike a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an eventual $57 billion to help the country to pay its bills.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez now looks set to take over Macri\u2019s mantle - as well as ongoing negotiations with creditors, including the IMF, about restructuring over $100 billion in sovereign debt amid fears the country could face a damaging default.\n\nFernandez, running with populist ex-President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, won the primary by almost 16 points, a feat which if repeated on Sunday would hand him the presidency outright, without needing a second round run-off.\n\nMost investors are already pricing in a Peronist opposition win, though a big victory could lead to renewed volatility in the markets, which have been constrained to a degree by recently imposed capital controls.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nFern\u00e1ndez, a former Cabinet chief, is seen as a moderate within the broad Peronist flank whose diplomacy skills have helped unite what was a fractured movement.\n\nThe rival candidates need 45% of the vote or 40% with a 10-point lead over the runner-up to avoid a second round, which if needed would be held on Nov. 24.\n\nVoters will chose presidential candidates, along with deputies, senators, governors and local leaders.", "description": "Argentines headed to the polls on Sunday, after a year of twists and turns in a dramatic election race that has been chastening for conservative President Mauricio Macri, who trails well behind Peronist rival Alberto Fernandez in opinion polls.", "authors": ["Nicol\u00e1s Misculin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445455943&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q090", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
