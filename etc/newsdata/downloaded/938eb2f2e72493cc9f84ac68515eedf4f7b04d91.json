The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that clashes continued in many areas close to the border.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Security is also not good because the guards had to be redeployed to the frontline or elsewhere. We hope it will be solved soon.\u201d\n\nSimilar fears were raised about Roj camp, which is closer to the border with Turkey and is home to 950 foreigners including Shamima Begum, who was part of the \u201cBethnal Green trio\u201d of girls who joined Isis.\n\nMeanwhile, residents of Qamishli border town said they were worried about the Isis prisons in the town after Kurdish fighters were forced to evacuate as part of the ceasefire deal.\n\nFormer British citizen Jack Letts or \u201cJihadi Jack\u201d is reportedly being held in Qamishli.\n\n\u201cRight now, they are guarding the Isis prisons as they have always done, but we don\u2019t know what will happen in the future. We are all very worried,\u201d Sara, a resident, said.", "description": "Kurdish commanders\u00a0in northern Syria have warned they cannot secure Islamic State prisons and camps for much longer, as sporadic fighting with Turkish forces continues despite a Russia-broken ceasefire.
