(Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images for World Food Program USA)\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Hunter Biden is stepping down from the board of a Chinese-backed private equity company and promising to forego all foreign work if his father, former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, is elected president in 2020.\n\nAfter months of keeping a relatively low-profile as President Donald Trump leveled a barrage of unsubstantiated accusations of corruption at him, the younger Biden is publicly vowing to avoid any conflict of interest.\n\nAccording to a statement released on his behalf by his lawyer George Mesires, Biden said he\u2019ll resign at the end of the month from the management company of a private equity fund that\u2019s backed by Chinese state-owned entities. He also pledged that he wouldn\u2019t work for any foreign-owned companies or serve on their boards during a potential Biden administration. He reiterated that he never discussed his business activities with his father.\n\n\u201cHunter always understood that his father would be guided, entirely and unequivocally, by established U.S. policy, regardless of its effects on Hunter\u2019s professional interests,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe never anticipated the barrage of false charges against both him and his father by the President of the United States.\u201d\n\nTrump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have repeatedly claimed, without providing evidence, that Hunter Biden made millions of dollars from China while his father was vice president. They\u2019ve also made unsubstantiated claims that Joe Biden used his position as the U.S. administration\u2019s point person on Ukraine to help quash an investigation in 2016 into the owner of one of the country\u2019s largest private gas companies where Hunter sat on the board.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump publicly called on China to investigate the Bidens. A spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry rejected that notion, saying it wouldn\u2019t interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.\n\n\u201cUnder a Biden Administration, Hunter will readily comply with any and all guidelines or standards a President Biden may issue to address purported conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts, including any restrictions related to overseas business interests,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe will continue to keep his father personally uninvolved in his business affairs.\u201d\n\nUkraine, China\n\nThe statement aims to set the record straight on Biden\u2019s past work in Ukraine and China, which Trump and Giuliani have fixated on as the 2020 campaign heats up. He served a five-year term on the board of Burisma, one of Ukraine\u2019s biggest private gas companies, whose owner had been under investigation for alleged money laundering and abuse of power. The allegations predated his joining the board in April 2014. He stepped down earlier this year.\n\nTrump has alleged that Vice President Biden in 2016 threatened to withhold billions of dollars in loan guarantees unless Ukraine fired the country\u2019s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, as a way to quash the probe and help his son. But U.S. and Ukrainian officials said the investigation at the time was dormant and that Shokin was fired for the opposite reason: failing to fight corruption.\n\n\u201cDespite extensive scrutiny, at no time has any law enforcement agency, either domestic or foreign, alleged that Hunter engaged in wrongdoing at any point during his five-year term,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAt the time he joined the Burisma board, Hunter was \u201cof counsel\u201d at Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, a U.S. law firm, and had been advising the company on \u201cits corporate reform initiatives,\u201d it said. He urged Boies Schiller to hire Nardello & Co., a consulting firm specializing in investigations, to assess Burisma\u2019s \u201ccorporate structure and governance practices.\u201d\n\nAleksander Kwasniewski, the former president of Poland, sat on the board of Burisma at the time and recruited Hunter as a non-executive director because of his advisory work for the gas company, the statement said. \u201cAt no time was Hunter in charge of the company\u2019s legal affairs,\u201d it said.\n\nHunter Biden also sought to counter increasing Trump campaign attacks on his ties to China. He denied Trump\u2019s repeated allegations that he procured $1.5 billion from China for a private equity fund after he flew on Air Force Two with his father in December 2013 to Beijing.\n\nHe serves on the board of BHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Company, which was set up in 2013 to invest Chinese capital outside China. He previously acknowledged meeting with Jonathan Li, a Chinese banker and partner in the fund, during the 2013 trip but has said it was a social visit and they didn\u2019t talk business.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hunter Biden is stepping down from the board of a Chinese-backed private equity company and promising to forego all foreign work if his father, former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, is elected president in 2020.After months of keeping a relatively low-profile as President Donald Trump", "authors": ["Stephanie Baker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zJ3ugN5YAEkwGo4HQpbArw--~B/aD0yMDAxO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/7b7b5ca0-edb0-11e9-9950-bcf647da8fff", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
