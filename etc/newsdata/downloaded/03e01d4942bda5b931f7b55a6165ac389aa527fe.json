Bush.\n\nEverything that's wrong with the toxic culture of identity politics was revealed by the reaction to a photo of four people watching an NFL football game in the United States on Sunday. At the game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Green Bay Packers, George W. Bush was sitting between his wife Laura and Ellen DeGeneres. On the other side of DeGeneres sat her wife, Portia de Rossi.\n\nBush is a former Republican president who opposed gay marriage. DeGeneres is a high-profile talk-show host whose political stance would in Australian terms be called centre-left, but in America is described as liberal or progressive. Social media and many parts of the mainstream media in the US erupted as DeGeneres was attacked for, among other things, creating \"a bad look\", betraying the gay and progressive community, and being \"irresponsible and dangerous\" for being seen with Bush.\n\nDouglas Murray: 'People are behaving in ways that are increasingly irrational, feverish, herd-like and simply unpleasant.' Getty\n\nDeGeneres has since replied, \"Here's the thing: I'm friends with George Bush. In fact, I'm friends with a lot of people who don't share the same beliefs that I have. We're all different, and I think that we've forgotten that that's OK ... Just because I don't agree with someone on everything doesn't mean that I'm not gonna be friends with them.\" DeGeneres has so far failed to placate her critics.\n\nA new book by the British writer Douglas Murray, The Madness of Crowds: Gender, Race and Identity, is a brilliant analysis of the world in which we now seem to be living, in which a gay liberal woman is condemned on social media because she's friends with a heterosexual conservative man.\n\nDouglas describes the new political and social culture of the US, Britain and Australia whereby people are encouraged to discover not how we are all essentially the same as each other, but how we are all different \u2013 and how we will always be different, with all the consequences that follow. Instead of looking for things on which to agree with each other, we're urged to emphasise how many things we disagree on. As Murray notes this not a recipe for long-term social cohesion.
