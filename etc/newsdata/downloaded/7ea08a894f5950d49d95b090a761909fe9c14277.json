And it was a tactic that worked, as within a minute they had the lead. Wales immediately turned over the first ruck after Michael Hooper claimed the kick-off, the ball was set back to Dan Biggar and he was quickly heading for the restart after firing off a rarely-seen drop-goal.\n\nThe opening quarter was all about Wales. It doesn\u2019t take much for this squad to rise to the occasion as they have shown countless times before, and it was evident how were pumped up for this one.\n\nThe tone was further set when Australia found themselves forced to concede penalty infringements in order to prevent try-scoring chances. That gave Wales numerous free plays to shoot for the line, and the at the first opportunity after Rory Arnold high-tackled Alun Wyn Jones, Biggar sent up a high cross-field kick that exposed Marika Koroibete and allowed Parkes to catch cleanly and score.\n\nThe conversion gave Wales an early double-digit lead, and Australia\u2019s jitters revealed themselves when captain Hooper levelled Biggar with a late tackle that in this current grey area of rugby officiating could have been yellow on another day.\n\nBut Australia were starting to find an ascendancy in the scrum and it proved the basis for their opening score.\n\nWith Wales threatening on the 22, Genia trapped a retreating Navidi at the base and \u2018Pooper\u2019 flooded in to win the penalty that sent the Wallabies marching up the field. With Australia now on the front foot that they crave, Samu Kerevi smashed through the midfield and, with Wales scrambling, Bernard Foley sent an inch-perfect cross-field kick to Adam Ashley-Cooper to dance inside Adams and Liam Williams to score.\n\nKerevi would also figure in another pivotal first-half moment. Williams looked to chase his own up-and-under, but the bounce settled nicely into Will Genia\u2019s arms and he released Koroibete rampaging up-field. With North conceding the penalty advantage, Kerevi had a free play and fixed Jonathan Davies beautifully, leaving just Biggar to beat.\n\nThe fly-half put his body on the line with a tackle you\u2019d never want you child to repeat on the weekend, but it did enough to dislodge the ball into touch.\n\nBiggar departed, HIA failed. His day was done.\n\nFoley kicked the penalty to cut the lead to two as on came Rhys Patchell in what was the biggest occasion of his rugby career. Soon enough he was increasing the lead with his first penalty after Hooper infringed at the ruck, and immediately after he was at the centre of attentions. Kerevi attempted to run through the fly-half with Patchell taking the centre high, but as play went on, TMO Ben Skeen had spotted the Fiji-born centre shoving his forearm into Patchell\u2019s throat.\n\nThose wearing gold inside the stadium were incensed, but Patchell kept his nerve to kick his second penalty.\n\nWith two minutes of the half remaining, Wales just needed to see out the first forty, refuel and regroup, and focus on the second half. Not in Davies\u2019s mind. The scrum-half had already intercepted once and he launched off the line with his trademark move to pick off Genia\u2019s attempted pass to Allan Alaalatoa to go the distance and score. With Patchell\u2019s conversion, Wales lead by 15 at the break and surely the curse was being lifted, with Australia needing a record World Cup comeback to win it.\n\nThat lead grew further with Patchell\u2019s drop-goal four minutes into the second half, boos ringing out from the green and gold in what was a release of frustration and horror more than anything. But we know what happens with Australia and Wales. It\u2019s never easy.\n\nTwo minutes after coming on, Matt Toomua showed why there were loud calls for him to start instead of Foley. The former Leicester fly-half broke down the left to combine with Koroibete. Williams stopped him but with play recycled quickly, Genia passed outside to Pocock, who used his strength to wear the tackles of Patchell and Aaron Wainwright and offload to Dane Haylett-Petty to score.\n\nAustralia knew they needed tries at 11 points down, and entering the final quarter, they got another back. Camped on the Welsh line a series of pick-and-goes had Wales on the ropes, with infringement after infringement coming. When Justin Tipuric was spotted offside, Poite had decided he\u2019d seen enough and the flanker was going to the bin, only Hooper delivered the try for his side that possibly saved their hopes, and definitely saved the Welshman. How crucial was that try in doing the latter?\n\nToomua added another penalty when Wales wheeled the scrum 12 minutes from time, but the 15-man defensive effort was holding the Wallabies at bay. With a point between them at 25-26 and 10 minutes remaining, it was anyone\u2019s game.\n\nYet, with a lineout infringement from replacement Lukhan Salakai-Loto, Patchell stretched the lead to the four points that it remained until the end. As time ran out in Tokyo, the floodlights began to fail in the Stadium. But Wales\u2019s World Cup hopes are alive and burning brightly.", "description": "Wales secured their first victory over a southern hemisphere team in 32 years by beating Australia 29-25 in a breath-taking contest, finally getting the monkey off their back while also signalling the beginning of much greater things to come.
