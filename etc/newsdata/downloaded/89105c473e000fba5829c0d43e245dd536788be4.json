(Image: NASA/Cassini)\n\nThe equatorial dunes on Saturn\u2019s moon Titan are among the most dramatic surface features in the Solar System, but scientists aren\u2019t exactly sure how they formed. New experimental evidence suggests the dunes arose as a result of cosmic rays hitting Titan\u2019s surface ice.\n\nTitan is one of the neatest places in the Solar System. It\u2019s a Saturnian moon that features a dense atmosphere, liquids at the surface in the form of hydrocarbon lakes and seas, enormous dust storms, and ice volcanoes that spew jets of water instead of molten lava.\n\nTitan also features an equatorial desert, called the Shangri-La Sand Sea, that\u2019s home to a network of monumental dunes, the tallest of which reach as high as 100 metres. Using NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft and the ESA\u2019s Huygens lander, researchers have been able to observe these dunes, which extend across an area measuring over 10 million square kilometres.\n\nOn Earth, sand dunes are composed primarily of silicates, but the dark dunes on Titan are built from organic materials, the origin and composition of which remain unknown.\n\nDunes on Titan\u2019s surface. (Image: University of Hawaii)\n\nPrevious research suggested these organics were created in Titan\u2019s atmosphere, the result of a chain reaction involving methane, nitrogen, and solar photons. Born in the sky, these particles rained down onto the desert\u2019s surface, providing the substrate for the dunes over geological timescales.\n\nNew research published this week in Science Advances presents a new explanation, suggesting the particles formed directly on Titan\u2019s surface due to complex chemical reactions triggered by the steady bombardment of interstellar cosmic rays.\n\nThanks to our trusty magnetosphere, Earth\u2019s surface is protected from this type of radiation, but the same can\u2019t be said for Titan, which can only rely on its thick atmosphere to absorb the incoming radiation.\n\nPhysical chemist Ralf Kaiser from the University of Hawaii and his colleagues conducted an experiment to see if frozen acetylene \u2014 a chemical compound used in welding \u2014 could be converted into complex organic molecules like the ones seen on Titan, specifically benzene and naphthalene. This research was prompted by prior observations of acetylene ice in regions near Titan\u2019s dunes.\n\nTo simulate the effects of cosmic rays, the researchers blasted their samples with high-energy electrons and then heated this chemically converted product to the point of sublimation (when solids turn directly into gas) for chemical analysis. The experiment produced the desired effect, turning the acetylene into dark organic gunk, or more technically, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) containing up to three or four carbon rings.\n\nThe new research shows that PAHs, including naphthalene and phenanthrene and its precursors benzene, phenylacetylene, and styrene, can be synthesised by irradiating frozen acetylene \u2014 a process that might be happening on Titan\u2019s surface and subsequently acting as \u201cas a critical molecular feedstock to the organic dune material,\u201d the authors wrote in the study.\n\nThis is obviously not proof that the dunes on Titan were produced in the same way, but it represents an intriguing possibility \u2014 both for Titan and for other places in the solar system, including celestial bodies devoid of atmospheres. In the same press release, Matthew Abplanalp, a co-author of the study, said \u201cunravelling the origin and chemical pathways to form this organic dune material is vital not only to understand Titan\u2019s chemical evolution, but also to grasp how alike the chemistries on Titan and on Earth might have been like before life emerged on Earth 3.5 million years ago.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re still not completely certain where the dune materials came from or what they\u2019re made of, but NASA\u2019s Dragonfly aerial drone could uncover more clues to this mystery, as the initial phase of the mission will see the probe investigate a series of sand dunes. Sadly, we\u2019re going to have to wait a while, as Dragonfly won\u2019t take to Titan\u2019s hazy golden skies until the mid-2030s.", "description": "The equatorial dunes on Saturn\u2019s moon Titan are among the most dramatic surface features in the Solar System, but scientists aren\u2019t exactly sure how they formed.
