I must have saved about \u00a31,000.\u2019\n\nThe mum-of-three completed the job in a few days, but said it would have gone quicker if she hadn\u2019t also been looking after her kids \u2013 Niamh, 11, Skye, 6, and Toren, 15 months.\n\nLast month, another woman revealed a similar hack, where she spent just \u00a350 and completely revamped her staircase.\n\nThere are ways to save money on home renovations, so long as you\u2019re willing to put in a bit of work yourself.\n\nMORE: Woman makes DIY air freshener with a sanitary pad\n\nMORE: Mum uses shaving cream to stop toilet stinking of pee after sons use it\n\nMORE: Transform your old furniture with these easy upcycling hacks\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Sarah Lindsey gave her staircase a makeover with affordable materials from B&Q, IKEA and The Range.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90982033_1571656656.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
