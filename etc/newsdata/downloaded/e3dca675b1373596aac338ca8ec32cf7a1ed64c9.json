The HBO Max streaming service is due to go live at some indeterminate day at an indeterminate price next spring, and NBC\u2019s Peacock streaming service is scheduled to officially launch in April 2020. Prices are also unknown for Peacock, though we do know it will be available in both ad-supported and ad-free tiers.\n\nEach of these services will feature exclusive content from big names, and a bunch of them will feature old favorites, be it the Marvel and Pixar catalogs over at Disney Plus, or reruns of The Office at Peacock.\n\nBut let\u2019s be real here. Even if these streaming services keep prices cheap for a while, very few of us are going to subscribe to all four of these services, especially if we\u2019ve already got Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, the ability to go outside or read a book and the like.\n\nSo which one is right for you? Smart dealers give you the first hit for free, and the companies behind these new streamers are hoping that if you just sample their wonderful, wonderful content, you\u2019ll fall in love and become paying subscribers forever. So some of them are finding ways to get you to try before you buy. Here\u2019s how you might be able to get a free subscription to Disney Plus, Apple TV Plus, HBO Max, and other streaming services.\n\nStream Disney Plus for Free\n\nVerizon has announced that some of its customers will get Disney Plus for free for one year, if they are already wireless internet customers (4G LTE or 5G). You can also, possibly, win a free Disney Plus subscription if you enter the Disney+ Dream Job contest run by Reviews.org.\n\nAll you have to do to win is watch 30 Disney movies on Disney+ within 30 days and then write a review of the streaming service. For this endeavor, Mother.Ly reports, winners will get \u201c$1,000, 12 months of Disney+, a mouse-themed blanket, four cups, a Pixar popcorn popper, and some popcorn.\u201d If that sounds like too much work, a normal Disney+ subscription costs $6.99 a month, and a bundle will be available wherein one gets Hulu, Disney Plus and ESPN+ for a not-unreasonable $12.99 a month.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 #TheMandalorian's first episode will contain a dramatic Star Wars-universe spoiler.

If you buy a new Apple TV (the streaming device, not the streaming service), iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, or Mac, you will get a voucher for a year\u2019s worth of free Apple TV Plus. (The streaming service, not the streaming device.)\n\nStream @TheMorningShow November 1 on the Apple TV app. \u2014 Apple TV (@AppleTV) October 22, 2019\n\nThe Apple TV+ streaming service will also be available for a free week\u2019s sample, if you\u2019re curious about Jason Momoa\u2019s muscles but don\u2019t need a new gadget.\n\nStream HBO for Free With HBO Max\n\nFortune recently reported that AT&T will give HBO Max away for free to the 10 million customers that already subscribe to plain old HBO. This will be especially helpful to people (who are most of us) who aren\u2019t clear on the difference between HBO and HBO Max. (Mostly old catalog stuff, it seems?) It is unclear how this deal will work for people who received their HBO for free as part of a cable bundle. Additionally, a (presumably cheaper) advertisement-supported tier (a first for HBO) is due in 2021.\n\nWho Can Stream NBC Peacock for Free?\n\nFinally, the Peacock streaming service will be free\u2026 if you already subscribe to cable or another qualifying pay TV provider, according to CNBC. If you\u2019re a cord-cutter (and bless if you\u2019re still making that lifestyle still work) Peacock will be available to stream at a price yet to be revealed. But can you really put a price on a Punky Brewster reboot?", "description": "Free subscription deals from new streaming services.", "authors": ["Michael Tedder"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jaF0gCvTT_zLiL2UVv9erQ--~B/aD0zMzMzO3c9NTAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/c65290cc6d153e65b42646c2b806b277", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
