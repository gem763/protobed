United crashed out of the MLS play-offs following a 5-1 defeat in Canada.\n\nThe former Manchester United forward, who is due to return to England to resume his career with Derby County in a player-coach role, had dragged his team back into the tie by laying on a dramatic equaliser, but it proved in vain.\n\nToronto FC had looked set to clinch the victory in normal time, with Marco Delgado's strike the only goal between the sides as the game moved into stoppage time.\n\nWayne Rooney's American adventure ended in disastrous fashion as DC United were beaten\n\nBut with one of their final attacks, the 33-year-old swung in a corner that was flicked on at the front post, finding its way through to Lucas Rodriguez who stabbed home into the roof of the net to breathe new life into United's play-off challenge.\n\nThe relief was fleeting though, as a rutheless Toronto side stormed the visitor's goal in the first period of extra-time.\n\nRichie Laryea restored his side's lead just three minutes in to the additional period, before Jonathan Osorio bundled home a third.\n\nRooney had helped his side get back into the game, delivering the corner for the equaliser\n\nLucas Rodriguez got to the ball and glashed it into the roof of the net in stoppage time to level\n\nToronto FC ran away with the game in extra time, scoring four goals in just 15 minutes\n\nOsorio then netted an impressive fourth, before Nick DeLeon scored the pick of the bunch with a curling effort against his former side.\n\nRooney was taken off the pitch at the break, and his last moments in the MLS were spent watching his team-mates capitulate in an ill-tempered second period, where Paul Arriola was sent off for two bookable offences.\n\nRooney will now take a break from action, before joining Championship outfit Derby in January next year.\n\nPhilip Cocu's side are currently 15th in the table, with 15 points from their first 12 matches.", "description": "The former Manchester United forward, who is due to return to England to resume his career with Derby County in a player-coach role, had helped his team back into the tie, but it proved in vain.", "authors": ["Harry Slavin For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/01/19942474-0-image-a-23_1571532935078.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
