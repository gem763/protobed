You can read the rest of the articles in this series here.\n\nMy phone is massive. If this were 2014, it would go mostly unnoticed. But today, people treat me like I\u2019m a freak.\n\nThe phone I\u2019m talking about is the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. It proudly carries the name \u201cphablet\u201d \u2014 a term most of us haven\u2019t used for the better part of a decade. With a size of 179.8 x 88.6 x 10.7mm (that\u2019s almost seven inches long) and a weight of 259g (over a half-pound) it certainly deserves that label. Lenovo Phab 2 Pro is an absolute unit, and I love every single gram.\n\nTo be fair, this wasn\u2019t always the case. I started using the Lenovo as a temporary replacement for a normal-sized, broken Google Pixel phone. The phablet was meant to be short term, damn it! But then I discovered its wonderful quirks and, most importantly, its everlasting battery life.\n\nBecause my huge phone is specifically made to run AR apps \u2014 a function I never need \u2014 \u2018just\u2019 using it for things like texting, browsing social media, and streaming Spotify means my Lenovo never dies. When I first started using it, it would run for two full days without needing to charge. For someone like me, who never thinks to bring a charger, this was life-changing.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s a great conversation starter. Whenever I\u2019m alone and feel like socializing but aren\u2019t quite sure what to say, all I need to do is take it out. Almost instantly, total strangers will start marveling at its size. Here are some of my Lenovo\u2019s Greatest Hits:\n\n\u201cOMG is that your phone? It\u2019s HUGE! I\u2019ve never seen a phone that big. Do you carry an extra bag?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat type of tablet is that? It\u2019s a phone? Really? So you can make calls with that thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I hold it?\u201d * holds Lenovo up to ear while holding a fake phone conversation, and bursts into hysterical laughter*\n\nOh, and then there\u2019s its entertainment value. With a screen just inches shy of an in-seat airplane monitor, guess who\u2019s binge-watching Fleabag the whole flight? That\u2019s right, me.\n\nSo why aren\u2019t more people using phones the size of their heads? How come I\u2019m still met with ridicule every time I overstretch my tiny lady thumbs in an attempt to text?\n\nPhablets have been mainstream ever since the Samsung Galaxy Note II\u2019s arrival in 2012, and they were subject to criticism instantly: \u2018Too big,\u2019 \u2018too clunky,\u2019 \u2018can\u2019t fit them in my skinny jeans\u2019 pockets.\u2019 Well guess what: smaller-sized bulges don\u2019t flatter your figure either, my friend. Stop whining about jamming your phone in your denim slits, and just get yourself a purse or backpack.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the mockery. In this 2014 Telegraph article, the author describes how her HTC became known as the \u2018clown phone\u2019 in her house because, \u201clike a clowns\u2019 giant shoes, it somehow makes the rest of you look smaller.\u201d She\u2019s right \u2014 and the way I see it, that makes Lenovo the ultimate wingman. Who doesn\u2019t want to own a phone that\u2019s both slimming as well as practical?\n\nSo here\u2019s my advice to all of you: rethink your phone size. You don\u2019t necessarily need to get a Lenovo Phab Pro \u2014 the Samsung Galaxy S10+ requires equally massive hands. But trust me, once you go phablet, you\u2019ll never want to go back to that ant-sized phone in your pocket again. Large devices mean big phone energy, and we could all use a little more of that.\n\nThis post includes affiliate links to products that you can buy online.
