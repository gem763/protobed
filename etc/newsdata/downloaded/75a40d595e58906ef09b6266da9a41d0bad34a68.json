(AP) - Most of Oklahoma\u2019s great running quarterbacks never put up numbers like Jalen Hurts did in his Sooners\u2019 debut.\n\nJack Mildren? Steve Davis? J.C. Watts, Jamelle Holieway or Charles Thompson?\n\nNope.\n\nNot even last year\u2019s Heisman Trophy winner, Kyler Murray, came close, at least in terms of single-game production. Hurts ran for 176 yards and three touchdowns to help No. 4 Oklahoma defeat Houston 49-31. Only Thomas Lott ever ran for more yards in a game from the quarterback position at Oklahoma than Hurts did in his very first game since transferring from Alabama.\n\nThat\u2019s a major accomplishment at a program that ran the wishbone for two decades.\n\n\u201cHe played with a chip on, and he wants everyone to know he still has it,\u201d Oklahoma receiver CeeDee Lamb said.\n\nLott set the single-game record for an Oklahoma quarterback with 195 yards against Kansas State in 1976. Hurts just edged out Holieway\u2019s 170-yard performance against North Carolina in 1987 for second place. Murray never ran for more than 114 yards in a game during his Heisman season.\n\nHurts\u2019 running style is different from many of the quarterbacks who have put up big numbers for the Sooners in the past. He has adequate speed, but at 219 pounds, his best asset is his ability to move the pile. He doesn\u2019t think about how he runs and shook his head when asked whether he embraces contact.\n\n\u201cI just try and go forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI just try and go forward. I don\u2019t know. I just try and go forward. Positive plays.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a mentality Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley appreciates as the Sooners prepare to host South Dakota on Saturday.\n\n\u201cSeveral examples the other night where he takes some contact and carries guys three, five, six more yards,\u201d Riley said. \u201cAnd those add up through the course of a game.\u201d\n\nHurts had 128 yards at halftime against Houston, matching the record Holieway set in 1985 for the most yards rushing by a Sooner quarterback in a first half. He also took a lot of hits, something Riley is concerned about.\n\n\u201cHe is built a little bit different than some of the guys we\u2019ve had in the past,\u201d Riley said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a body to be able to withstand some, but at the same time, we don\u2019t want him taking a bunch of unnecessary ones, either. That will be an ongoing conversation with Jalen and I, trying to find that kind of middle ground, where he can still be an effective runner, because he is.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s nothing new for Hurts to put up big rushing numbers. He piled up 1,976 yards and 23 touchdowns rushing in his three-year career at Alabama. But he topped his career rushing high in his first game in Riley\u2019s offense. He posted 508 yards of total offense - the fifth-highest total in school history.\n\n\u201cI got out there and try to execute what\u2019s called and prepare every day throughout the week,\u201d Hurts said. \u201cGame plan\u2019s great. Regardless of what it is, we have to execute. That\u2019s what I do, that\u2019s my intent.\u201d\n\nThe dynamic performance already has reporters asking him about the Heisman Trophy - a fair question since he\u2019s following the past two winners, Baker Mayfield and Murray. When asked if the Heisman Trophy is a goal for him, Hurts replied: \u201cWinning football games is a goal for me.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Most of Oklahoma's great running quarterbacks never put up numbers like Jalen Hurts did in his Sooners' debut.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Cliff Brunt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/01/houston_oklahoma_football_59552_c0-103-2352-1474_s1770x1032.jpg?475e3469758df5190c183cb583a9a85bf4a2a161"}
