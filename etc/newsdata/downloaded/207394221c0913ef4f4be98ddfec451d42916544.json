Moments after Helen Worden's unlikely shot found the back of the net, the BHS players turned toward the grandstand, and several removed the tops of their blue uniforms to reveal custom-made T-shirts.\n\nThe message: #EQUALPAY.\n\nTheir effort to join the World Cup-winning U.S. women's national soccer team in advocating for gender equality took the spotlight at Buck Hard Field. But their protest of the wage gap also came at a price \u2014 anyone who removes her jersey during a game earns an automatic yellow card.\n\n\"I kinda liked that part,\" Maggie Barlow said, \"I just didn't like the part where we lost (the lead).\"\n\nSouth Burlington equalized two minutes later, and neither side scored after that, forcing the Seahorses to settle for something other than the victory. However, Burlington hardly lost the day.\n\nAs the referees issued yellow cards to four Burlington players, the crowd chanted \"Equal pay.\" Many of them were wearing the #equalpay jerseys, part of the more than 500 the team had sold in a fundraising campaign.\n\nOriginally, the plan was to make #equalpay shirts for their team's dress-up day. It wasn't long before athletes on other BHS teams wanted in, and word spread beyond the school.\n\n\"Then we partnered with some organizations that focus on women's economic security in Vermont, and we designed these jerseys and it kind of spread like wildfire,\" team member Lydia Sheeser said.\n\nBurlington's Ruby Guth, right, Sage Smith and Helen Worden react to the referees issuing cards for a goal celebration in Friday night's girls soccer game against South Burlington.

Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and his wife, Marcelle, were among those who bought one of the Nike shirts. Each costs $25, with men invited to pay 16% more ($4.80) as a symbol of the average disparity between what men and women make in Vermont.\n\nThe girls team encouraged the BHS boys team to join them and even helped fundraise to provide jerseys for them to wear during warm-ups. Wearing the special jerseys during a recent game, the boys celebrated in similar fashion, but with a subtle difference sparing them from yellow cards.\n\n\"When they scored, they lifted (their jersey) up but didn't actually take it off,\" Barlow said. \"They ended up being really enthusiastic about it, and that's been my favorite part.\"\n\nNow they're on the verge of ordering another 300 jerseys next week. The profits will go toward helping diversify the Greater Burlington Girls Soccer League, Sheeser said, hopefully alleviating transportation issues that keep girls from the New North End from participating in soccer.\n\nDue to popular demand @BHS802 girls soccer team has extended the deadline to order jerseys w/ #EqualPay on the front, mighty Seahorse on one sleeve & @ChangeStoryVT logo on the other. Reserve by 10/22! https://t.co/UzruVhkObXpic.twitter.com/eLsIujxSQ7 \u2014 Burlington Schools (@BTVSchools) October 9, 2019\n\nThe players said they want to spur change that allows the youth league to better represent the city.\n\n\"The demographics of Burlington don't really match the demographics of GBGSL,\" Barlow said.\n\n\"And then eventually, hopefully, they'll come and play here at BHS,\" Worden said. \"Our team doesn't reflect the demographics of Burlington either, ultimately.\"\n\nContact Austin Danforth at 651-4851 or edanforth@freepressmedia.com.
