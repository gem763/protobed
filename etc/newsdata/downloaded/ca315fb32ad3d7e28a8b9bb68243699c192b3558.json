(WELL) said profit rose in the third quarter and funds from operations were in line with Wall Street expectations.\n\nThe real estate investment trust said net income was $589.9 million, or $1.45 a share, compared with $64.4 million, or 17 cents a share, a year earlier.\n\nThe increase in profit was driven by higher income from unconsolidated entities and a larger gain from the sale of real estate compared with the year-ago period. The company's income from unconsolidated entities was $3.3 million compared with $344,000 in the same quarter a year earlier. Welltower also posted a $570.3 million gain from its sale of real estate in the quarter, compared with a $24.7 million gain in the comparable quarter a year ago.\n\nFunds from operations were $1.05 a share compared with $1.04 a share a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet expected funds from operations of $1.04 a share.\n\nRevenue rose 2.4% from a year ago to $1.27 billion. Analysts were expecting $1.32 billion in revenue.\n\nWrite to Kimberly Chin at kimberly.chin@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 28, 2019 17:14 ET (21:14 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
