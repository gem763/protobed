He appears to be trying to talk to the boy.\n\nParv Jain, 3, fell 35ft from a second-floor balcony and survived after landing directly on a passing rickshaw in Tikamgarh in Madhya Pradesh state, India, on October 18\n\nA local businessman runs out of a building across the street to check on the boy.\n\nAnd slowly more gather around, with four each lending a hand to help lift the little boy out of the rickshaw.\n\nParv is carried in the arms of one of the men and rushed into the nearby shop while another is standing outside waiting.\n\nLocal residents gather around the boy and help lift him from the truck and into safety. After a few seconds, a woman, who could be Parv's mother, appears clutching the boy in her arms\n\nAs one of the men drive the cart away as others stand and observe the drop which the boy fell from.\n\nThen a woman, who could be Parv's mother, appears clutching the boy in her arms and a man calls her over.\n\nPeople push the man, who is carrying Parv, into the building across the street.
