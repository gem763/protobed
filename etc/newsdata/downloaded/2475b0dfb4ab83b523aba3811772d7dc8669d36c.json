(Image: Sony Pictures, Instagram)\n\nIn 2004, while Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) was busy confronting the ghost of a brutally murdered woman in Tokyo, apparently there was someone else across the pond with their own grudge. Next year\u2019s entry in The Grudge series won\u2019t just be a spiritual successor to Takashi Shimizu\u2019s franchise \u2014 it\u2019ll be happening alongside it.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Weekly, the latest Sam Raimi-produced Grudge film takes place at the same time as the 2004 American remake of Ju-on, which was directed by Shimizu, the man behind the original series.\n\nBut instead of taking place in Japan, the new Grudge is happening concurrently in a small town in the United States.\n\nThe film centres around a cop named Mandy (Andrea Riseborough) whose job leads her to investigate an old home that has been \u201cgrudged\u201d. Her storyline will interweave with two others, told at slightly different times, centring around the house and what happened to the people in it.\n\nIn an interview with EW, director Nicolas Pesce (The Eyes of My Mother) described The Grudge as an \u201canthology series\u201d, so this film is a continuation of the franchise rather than a reboot or remake.\n\nHowever, there are some complications with that. Shimizu is not involved, even though he directed The Grudge and Grudge 2 and served as an executive producer on the third one. Also, Ju-on writer and producer Taka Ichise filed a lawsuit last year claiming the production company denied him a producer credit (he is now listed).\n\nFor being a movie set in this anthology series, it\u2019s done a lot of things that have separated it from its origins.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of The Grudge franchise, both the American and Japanese iterations, is it\u2019s an anthology series. Every movie is a different story of different characters having different interactions with this curse,\u201d Pesce said.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s age where we\u2019re remaking everything, I thought it would be fun to dive into The Grudge universe where we don\u2019t have to remake anything, but rather a new chapter in this canon.\u201d\n\nThe Grudge arrives in cinemas on 30 January 2020.", "description": "In 2004, while Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) was busy confronting the ghost of a brutally murdered woman in Tokyo, apparently there was someone else across the pond with their own grudge.
