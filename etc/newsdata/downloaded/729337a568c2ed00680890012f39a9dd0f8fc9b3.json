Police were working to reunite the others with family members.\n\n\"The inmates are actually from different parts of the country - Kano, Taraba, Adamawa and Plateau States,\" he said. \"Some of them are not even Nigerians. They come from Niger, Chad and even Burkina Faso and other countries.\"\n\nIslamic schools, called Almajiris, are common in the mostly Muslim north of Nigeria. Muslim Rights Concern, a local organisation, estimates about 10 million children attend them.\n\nWhile Buhari said the government planned to ban the schools eventually, he has not yet commented on the Katsina school.\n\nAfter the Kaduna raid, the president called on traditional authorities to work with government to expose \"unwanted cultural practices that amount to the abuse of children\".
