This is deadly serious,\" she said.\n\nThe presser came just before Democratic presidential candidates were set to take the stage in the fourth debate of the 2020 primary.\n\nSchiff said that \"the Constitution is very clear: The House will have the sole power of impeachment.\"\n\n\"Republicans know it, but they don't want to discuss the president's conduct,\" Schiff added. \"They'd rather discuss the process.\"\n\nPelosi has dismissed the calls for a vote as a \"Republican talking point,\" and said in an interview earlier this month that \"we're certainly not going to do it because of the president.\"\n\nRepublicans have seized on Pelosi's stance. Vice President Mike Pence, who had been sent a request for documents as part of the probe, on Tuesday said he would refuse to comply with the \"self-proclaimed 'impeachment inquiry,'\" according to a two-page letter to Democratic House committee leaders by his counsel.", "description": "Republican lawmakers and White House officials have criticized Democrats' efforts as an illegitimate attempt to undermine Trump.", "authors": ["Kevin Breuninger"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106183276-1571176013421gettyimages-1176109795.jpeg?v=1571176041", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
