Japan said it landed in its exclusive economic zone - a band of 200km around Japanese territory.\n\nThe test came hours after North Korea said nuclear talks with the US would resume.\n\nWhat do we know about this missile?\n\nThe missile was launched from the sea soon after 07:00 on Wednesday (22:00 GMT Tuesday), about 17km north-east of the coastal city of Wonsan.\n\nNorth Korea's state news agency KCNA said on Thursday the missile was a Pukguksong-3 test-fired at a high angle, designed to \"contain external threat and bolster self-defence\".\n\nIt added there was \"no adverse impact on the security of neighbouring countries\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on\n\nUnlike previous tests, there were no pictures of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at the launch.\n\nIn the previous 10 missile tests carried out this year, only short-range projectiles were fired.\n\nWhy is 'submarine-capable' significant?\n\nIf the missile was launched on a standard trajectory, instead of a vertical one, it could have travelled around 1,900 km (1,200 miles). That would have put all of South Korea and Japan within range.\n\nBut being launched from a submarine can make missiles harder to detect, and allows them to get closer to other targets.\n\nNorth Korea's existing Romeo-class submarines, which were built in the 1990s, are believed to have a range of about 7,000 km, the Reuters news agency said.\n\nThis would make a one-way trip to near Hawaii possible.\n\nThe north's submarines are, however, diesel-powered - which makes them noisier and easier to detect.\n\n'A grave moment for regional security'\n\nBy Ankit Panda, North Korea analyst\n\nNorth Korea's introduction of the Pukguksong-3 submarine-launched ballistic missile is a grave moment for North East Asian regional security - and a reminder of what has been lost over nearly two years of all-show-no-substance diplomacy.\n\nThis missile is destined for a submarine, but it wasn't launched from one. North Korea's engineers may have deemed it too risky to stake their one operational ballistic missile submarine in a test. Nevertheless, the missile appears to have successfully completed its flight with flying colours.\n\nThe Pukguksong-3, if it had been flown at a more normal angle, could have reached all of Japan's four main islands and all of South Korea from the centre of the Sea of Japan.\n\nMost seriously, it represents the largest-ever solid-fuel system seen in North Korea. Solid-fuel missiles have many advantages over their liquid-fuel counterparts. They offer greater responsiveness and flexibility; unlike their liquid counterparts, they do not require extensive fuelling and preparation before use.\n\nThis test underscores why the United States must make extensive efforts to freeze North Korea's qualitative progress on missile technologies.\n\nAnkit Panda is adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists and author of forthcoming book Kim Jong Un and the Bomb.\n\nHow will this affect US talks?\n\nBefore the missile test, North Korea and the US confirmed that preliminary nuclear talks would take place \"within the next week\".\n\nThe US state department responded to the test by calling on Pyongyang to \"refrain from provocations\" and \"remain engaged in substantive and sustained negotiations\" aimed at bringing denuclearisation.\n\nNegotiations between the US and North Korea have stalled since the Hanoi summit between President Donald Trump and Mr Kim in February ended without an agreement.\n\nExperts said the proximity of the test and the talks announcement was deliberate.\n\n\"North Korea wants to make its negotiating position quite clear before talks even begin,\" Harry Kazianis of the Center for the National Interest in Washington DC told the AFP news agency.\n\n\"Pyongyang seems set to push Washington to back off from past demands of full denuclearisation, for what are only promises of sanctions relief.\"\n\nNorth Korea is banned from using ballistic missiles by UN Security Council resolutions, and is under US and UN sanctions for its nuclear programme.\n\nReports suggest that, in the upcoming talks, the US may offer a suspension of UN sanctions on North Korean textile and coal exports for 36 months. In return, it wants the closure of the Yongbyon nuclear facility, and the end of uranium enrichment.\n\nThis is \"less than the all-or-nothing approach Washington has taken so far\", Vox reports.", "description": "Being submarine-capable means North Korea could launch missiles far outside its territory.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DAD2/production/_109081065_7438c2ac-0510-4259-b46f-2ef38de93976.jpg"}
