(Kyodo/via Reuters)\n\nLeft and Right suddenly agree on the hypocrisy of corporate activism.\n\nFor more than four years \u2014 from the opening moments of the rise of so-called woke capital \u2014 conservatives have been yelling about the blatant, obvious hypocrisy of the entire activist corporate enterprise. The same companies that imposed or threatened economic sanctions against such states as Indiana, North Carolina, and Georgia after they used the democratic process to pass socially conservative legislation have been happily doing business in murderous nations like China and Saudi Arabia. Even worse, eager to avoid offending a government that can instantly shut off access to its immense market, they\u2019ve granted China an enormous amount of control over their products and operations.\n\nIt\u2019s an old problem, but thanks to the craven actions of the NBA and Blizzard Entertainment \u2014 two companies much-beloved by many American progressives \u2014 woke capital hasn\u2019t just alienated conservatives, it\u2019s alienated progressives who actually care about progressive values. The hypocrisy is now too glaring to be ignored. Consider a few important examples.\n\nFirst, I\u2019d urge you to read to read Zack Beauchamp\u2019s excellent, scorching takedown of Blizzard\u2019s decision to suspend a Hong Kong\u2013based professional Hearthstone player (Hearthstone is a video card game based on characters from the Blizzard game universe) and forfeit his prize money after he voiced support for the Hong Kong protestors. Here\u2019s Beauchamp, writing in Vox:\n\nCensoring a professional player for expressing support for the democracy movement in Hong Kong \u2014 and seizing his money \u2014 is way over the line. It isn\u2019t merely adjusting a cosmetic part of the product to fit a particular market; it\u2019s actively participating in the suppression of political speech on behalf of core liberal values. Blizzard is throwing its lot in with an authoritarian state, acting as an international agent of its repressive apparatus in opposition to fundamental human rights.\n\nHe\u2019s exactly right. China has such a hold on an American company that an American company is engaging in an extraordinarily un-American act. It\u2019s inexcusable.\n\nSecond, stop what you\u2019re doing and read Jamil Smith at Rolling Stone. Smith is hardly anyone\u2019s idea of a right-wing critic of woke capital, but conservatives can agree with every syllable of this paragraph:\n\nFor all its MLK Day t-shirts and other symbolic gestures towards wokeness here in the States, this is still the league that sees fit to do business with a regime that represses human rights whenever given the chance.The league even has a presence in Xinjang, in the northwest of the country. It is the Chinese region where Slate reported last year the nation\u2019s authorities were holding roughly one million Muslims, the Turkic-speaking minority called Uighurs, in concentration camps. The NBA has a different kind of camp there \u2014 one of its three national training camps \u2014 in \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, Xinjang\u2019s capital.\n\nFinally, it was left-wing Deadspin that broke the news that ESPN\u2019s senior news director had circulated a memo \u201cmandating that any discussion\u201d of the China NBA controversy \u201cavoid any political discussions about China and Hong Kong, and instead focus on the related basketball issues.\u201d It also published a scathing piece accusing ESPN\u2019s Stephen A. Smith of \u201cbootlicking\u201d in his commentary on China.\n\nTo be clear, this is a very partial sampling of the left-wing political and media revulsion directed at the NBA, ESPN, and others over the course of the past few days. Yes, there have long been progressive critics of American corporate activity in China, but I can\u2019t recall the last time I saw such a crescendo of criticism. In the most progressive quarters of the Internet, \u201cwoke capitalism\u201d has been exposed as far less \u201cwoke\u201d than it is \u201ccapitalist,\u201d and its domestic political stands now look far more opportunistic than principled. When the going gets economically tough, these domestic culture warriors flee the foreign field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven worse, they bring Chinese speech values to American shores. Blizzard isn\u2019t the only American company to punish speech that Chinese authorities despise. Yesterday, at an exhibition game against a Chinese team, the Philadelphia 76ers ejected two fans after they held up signs that said \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d and \u201cFree HK\u201d and after they yelled \u201cFree Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe moment Sam Wachs and his wife are escorted out of the @sixers preseason game against a Chinese basketball team for yelling \u201cFree Hong Kong.\u201d @6abc pic.twitter.com/3HlZxKXDzs \u2014 Christie Ileto (@Christie_Ileto) October 9, 2019\n\nIn fact, the progressive criticism (I don\u2019t think for a moment that conservative media has the slightest impact on Adam Silver) is probably responsible for the NBA issuing a second statement yesterday that more decisively declared that the NBA supports the free speech of its employees. But terrible damage has already been done. How many NBA players will feel truly free to attack China\u2019s monstrous human-rights abuses?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not na\u00efve. I know that progressives who condemn the NBA today will cheer it tomorrow if and when it turns its hypocritical fire back on its domestic political foes. But regardless of domestic politics, American corporate complicity in Chinese censorship and Chinese suppression is now revealing itself as an issue that clearly transcends the partisan American divide. And if that short-lived unity can expose hypocrisy and alter the incentives that have led corporations to enable Communist human-rights abuses, then that unity is not in vain.\n\nIn the meantime, the next time that Disney or the NBA or any of the other compromised companies takes a \u201cbrave\u201d stand against conservatives here at home, millions more Americans will know the truth. Their \u201cprinciples\u201d stop at the water\u2019s edge. They\u2019ll sell out those same ideals to chase the Chinese yuan.", "description": "American corporate complicity in Chinese censorship and Chinese suppression is now revealing itself as an issue that clearly transcends the partisan American divide.", "authors": ["David French", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "Rich Lowry", "Kevin D.
