The Wagners family, which owns 55 per cent of the company, is taking up their full allocation of shares.\n\nThe equity issue will boost Wagners' net assets to $102 million from $62.6 million, and reduce its borrowings to $50 million from $81.7 million.\n\nThe capital raising comes less than two years after Wagners' stock floated on the Australian Securities Exchange.\n\nThe shares, which were listed at $2.71 in December 2017 and hit all-time highs of $4.89 in October 2018, slumped this year after the company said in March that it had temporarily stopped supplying Boral - its biggest customer - with cement due to a disagreement over pricing. Wagners' shares jumped seven per cent to $1.90 in early trade on Monday.\n\nThe company reported a 48.5 per cent slump in annual net profit to $12.8 million in August due to falling earnings from its core construction, materials and services business and axed its final dividend as its shares trade near all-time lows.\n\nWagners has two main business units: new generation building materials (which includes composite fibre) and construction materials and services, which includes cement.\n\nCement sales have been hurt by the dispute with Boral and Wagners said on Tuesday that conditions in the south-east Queensland market remained challenging due to more competition from new entrant Southern Cross Cement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConstruction revenues have been weakened by delays in big infrastructure projects but the company expects to benefit from a rebounding resources sector, Wagners said.\n\nAbout 40 per cent of the cement produced by Wagners is supplied to Boral's Queensland resources business following a complex agreement between the two companies negotiated after the sale of Wagners' concrete business to Boral in 2011. The agreement requires Boral to buy cement from Wagners until December 2021.\n\nBoral is trying to get Wagners to lower the price it charges to supply cement, claiming it can buy cement at significantly cheaper prices elsewhere in south-east Queensland.\n\nWagners has taken the dispute to court and a trial on the matter will be heard in the Supreme Court of Queensland starting on November 28.\n\nWagners has not disclosed the exact terms of the contract with Boral but was required to start supplying it with cement again last week.\n\nThe entitlement offer opens on November 6 and closes on November 15. About 25.8 million new Wagners shares will be issued.", "description": "Queensland construction group Wagners wants to build new plants in the US as markets weaken at home.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1a608a5795ff69869d66175186fcebc0865bf0b3", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
