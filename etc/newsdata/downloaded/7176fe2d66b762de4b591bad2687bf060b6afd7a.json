Candidates offered some of the most emotional moments discussing their visions for tightening gun laws following two mass shootings in Texas last month.\n\nAnd for the third straight debate, former Vice President Joe Biden faced the toughest and most persistent barbs from his fellow Democratic White House hopefuls.\n\nHere's what else we gleaned from the stage in Houston:\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), former tech executive Andrew Yang, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) interact after the Democratic Presidential Debate at Texas Southern University's Health and PE Center on Sept. 12, 2019 in Houston, Texas. Ten Democratic presidential hopefuls were chosen from the larger field of candidates to participate in the debate hosted by ABC News in partnership with Univision. More\n\n1: Biden once again takes licks but keeps standing.\n\nIn a pointed exchange, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro attacked Biden for selling himself as Barack Obama's wingman and partner when it's convenient, but shying away from the former president's more controversial decisions, including Obama's record on deportations of undocumented immigrants.\n\nThat was after Sen. Bernie Sanders slammed Biden's proposal to expand health care as shortsighted amidst the former vice president's contention that Sanders Medicare for All would be too costly.\n\n\"Well, Joe said that Medicare for All would cost over $30 trillion,\" said Sanders, who repeatedly referred to Biden by his first name. \"That's right, Joe. (But) status quo over 10 years will be $50 trillion. Every study done shows that Medicare for All is the most cost-effective approach to providing health care to every man, woman, and child in this country. I, who wrote the damn bill, if I may say so ...\"\n\nIn perhaps the most sharp exchange of the night, Castro accused Biden of forgetting what he had said two minutes earlier as they contrasted health care plans \u2014 a not so subtle dig at Biden's penchant for gaffes.\n\nSharp exchange: Castro appears to misrepresent Biden's health care plan during debate\n\nThe rumble in Space City: Democratic debate featured frontrunners who battled each other, attacked Trump\n\nBut a few of Biden's Democratic rivals came to his defense, suggesting Castro's digs went too far.\n\n\"This is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,\" South Bend, Indiana Mayor Peter Buttigieg intoned. \"This reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington, scoring points against each other, poking at each other, and telling each other that \u2014 my plan, your plan. Look, we all have different visions for what is better.\"\n\nAt the first debate in Miami, Biden was called out by rivals for comments at a fundraiser about segregationist lawmakers and Sen. Kamala Harris landed the biggest blow over his opposition to busing to integrate schools during his time as a senator.\n\nBiden took plenty of punches Thursday, but he walked away, once again, fairly unscathed.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates former Vice President Joe Biden, left and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., talk Thursday, Sept. 12, 2019, during a Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by ABC at Texas Southern University in Houston. More\n\n2: The much anticipated Elizabeth Warren-Joe Biden showdown didn't happen.\n\nSoon after he entered the race in April, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts noted Biden\u2019s ties to the credit card industry during his time in the Senate. He voted for legislation that tightened rules on who could qualify for bankruptcy protection and benefited credit card companies.", "description": "The leading Democratic presidential candidates appeared on stage together for the first time for Thursday night's debate\u00a0\u2014 and the field was feisty.", "authors": ["Aamer Madhani", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VjITz3bR3Ise9iQ92t2R5A--~B/aD0yODgxO3c9NDMyMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/5580cdf0086bb3a2cadbc2d9c65e5660", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
