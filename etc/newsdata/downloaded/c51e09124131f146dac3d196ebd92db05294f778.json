Steven Wise, the founder and lead attorney of the group, has led a quest that is dogged \u2013 appropriately, as he has ruminated that dogs may be \u201clegal persons\u201d, too \u2013 to confer personhood on a pair of chimpanzees and now Happy.\n\nWise has yet to taste success. In 2017, a New York appeals court ruled that Kiko and Tommy, two chimps in their 30s kept in captivity in the state, could not be considered persons in order to invoke habeas corpus \u2013 the right to avoid unlawful detention.\n\nA presiding judge wrote that while chimps share many fundamental characteristics of humans, it would be difficult to hold any ape to account for its personhood by arresting and prosecuting it for a crime. A further blow to Wise came in August, when a Connecticut court similarly decided that three elephants \u2013 Beulah, Minnie and Karen \u2013 could not be deemed persons.\n\nUndeterred, Wise is now arguing on behalf of Happy, an animal that scientists found can recognize herself in a mirror. The 47-year-old elephant has spent almost all her life in a one-acre enclosure at the Bronx Zoo after being captured along with six other calves \u2013 named Sleepy, Grumpy, Sneezy, Doc, Dopey and Bashful \u2013 in Thailand and brought to the US.\n\nHappy and Grumpy cohabited until 2002, when they were relocated to an enclosure with two other elephants \u2013 Maxine and Patty. This arrangement turned sour when Maxine and Patty fatally attacked Grumpy. Happy has never been able to live contentedly with the duo, with a recent reconciliation attempt ending badly.\n\nHappy\u2019s lone captivity is anathema to the intricate social arrangements elephants have in the wild, according to experts cited by the Nonhuman Rights Project, which wants her relocated to a far larger sanctuary in California that has other elephants.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t that just be like a larger prison?\u201d asked the Bronx supreme court judge Alison Tuitt, who earlier in proceedings remarked that she had watched a TV show in which a lemur attacked its own reflection in the mirror.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bit like saying the Earth is a prison,\u201d Wise replied. The two later had an inconclusive exchange over whether a guide dog could claim personhood.\n\nDuring lengthy testimony, Wise compared Happy\u2019s situation to the plight of slaves in the US, who weren\u2019t considered fully human, and pointed out how a river in New Zealand and a Colombian portion of the Amazon rainforest have been granted human-like rights. \u201cShe is one depressed elephant,\u201d Wise said of Happy, unhappily. \u201cShe\u2019s being harmed every day.\u201d\n\nThe Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), which runs Bronx Zoo, strongly rejects any notion that Happy is distressed or badly treated. Jim Breheny, the zoo\u2019s director, has called the lawsuit \u201cludicrous\u201d and said the Nonhuman Rights Project is \u201cexploiting the Bronx Zoo elephants to advance their own failing cause\u201d.\n\nWCS said that Happy is not kept in isolation given that she has tactile contact with Patty through a barrier, to ensure neither elephant is hurt. The conservation organization said that Happy is \u201csubordinate in nature\u201d, is comfortable with her keepers and likely to be bullied by other elephants if she were to be moved. The zoo has declined to add additional elephants for the past decade.\n\n\u201cIt would be irresponsible and risky for Happy\u2019s wellbeing for us to bow to uninformed outside voices with political agendas,\u201d a WCS spokesperson said.\n\nPolling of Americans has shown strong support for granting animals the same rights as humans, with the concept also backed by some philosophers who argue that animals have moral standing and shouldn\u2019t be considered merely as property.\n\nUS courts, however, disagree and critics have claimed unintended consequences of animal personhood, such as the potential erosion of rights of disabled people, and difficulties defining which animals deserve rights and who speaks for them.\n\nThe idea of \u201cfreedom\u201d from humans may also be more opaque at second glance. On Monday, across the road from the court in the Bronx\u2019s Joyce Kilmer Park, starlings cavorted in the bubbling water of a grand fountain dedicated to the German poet Johann Heine. The contrast with Happy, and other captive animals, would appear obvious.\n\nBut in the past month it has been revealed that human activity in North America has wiped out an incredible one in four birds since 1970. Two-thirds of the remaining species face being obliterated due to the climate crisis. There may be freedom, even an outpouring of what may look to us as joy in the weak autumn sunshine. But there\u2019s not much escape.\n\nHappy\u2019s case will plod on regardless, with the further court date set for January.", "description": "Lawyers representing an elephant say she is being detained by the Bronx Zoo \u2018illegally\u2019 due to her personhood", "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66373f46ae3d9d5de88645ed4a9dd7478b597a69/748_1155_2941_1764/master/2941.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a12545461b5ce1629d3c912eea4b7e3b", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
