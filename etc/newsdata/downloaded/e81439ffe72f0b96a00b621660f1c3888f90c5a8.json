Top speed is 89 mph.\n\nThe zero-emissions hatchback will, Nissan says, travel 50 per cent further, deliver 38 per cent more power, and cost up to \u00a31,500 less than the original\n\nThe new Leaf is sprightly on steep inclines, does a fair lick on motorways, and can accelerate from rest to 62 mph in 7.9 seconds. Top speed is 89 mph\n\nCharging the onboard 40kWh lithium-ion batteries at home takes 21 hours. But fit a new 7kW fast home-charging point and that reduces to 7.5 hours\n\nWhile the first-generation Leaf, which has sold 300,000 worldwide and 21,000 in Britain since its launch in 2011, appealed to geeks, this one\u2019s more conventional hatchback styling works well.\n\nIt\u2019s nimble in normal drive mode, with instant acceleration that\u2019s as quiet as a Rolls-Royce.\n\nA little blue button makes the accelerator pedal double as a brake when you lift your foot, which means your driving is smoother.\n\nIt boasts easy-to-navigate controls and sat nav on the dashboard, console and 7 in touch screen.\n\nIf you hate parking, you\u2019ll love this car. Press the parking button, drive slowly along a row of parked cars, and it\u2019ll reverse itself into a sufficiently large space.\n\nLooker: While the first-generation Leaf appealed to geeks, this one\u2019s more conventional hatchback styling works well\n\nThe biggest problem with the new Leaf isn't down to the car itself, its that there simply aren\u2019t enough public charging points in the UK yet\n\nA Leaf rolls off the Sunderland production line with deliveries beginning on February 2\n\nIt drives itself, up to a point. On a motorway, with the ProPilot system, you set a speed and a distance to the car in front. It then brakes if you get too close and accelerates when clear. Great in jams.\n\nCharging the onboard 40kWh lithium-ion batteries at home takes 21 hours. But fit a new 7kW fast home-charging point and that reduces to 7.5 hours.\n\nYou can drive 168 miles on a full charge \u2014 258 miles in the city.\n\nThis is a cracker of a car that both surprises and delights - and happens to be powered by electricity.\n\nIt may not be lightning fast like a Tesla but it might just persuade you away from a rival Tesla Model 3.\n\nBut there are some bad points.\n\nNever mind \u2018Are we there yet?\u2019. The question is: \u2018Will we ever get there?\u2019 Despite improvements there\u2019s no getting around power range-anxiety.\n\nIf the battery level falls, the car\u2019s regenerative braking system can generate power to recharge on the move and get you there. But it does mean some nervous moments.\n\nThe rather austere all-black interior looks dull and gloomy. It\u2019s still eerie to drive off in almost complete silence.\n\nBut the biggest problem with the new Leaf isn't down to the car itself, its that there simply aren\u2019t enough public charging points in the UK yet.\n\nThe rather austere all-black interior looks dull and gloomy.
