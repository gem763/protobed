It\u2019s better to impeach these investing ideas", "language": "en", "text": "This website is, to a large degree, about impeachment \u2014 about impeaching bad ideas from the worlds of finance and economics. So here are some impeachable ideas I\u2019ve been thinking about lately:\n\n1. Market-cap-weighted index funds are \u201cimmoral.\u201d What? Here\u2019s an article on MarketWatch where someone who runs a \u201csocially responsible investment\u201d firm says that owning a simple index fund is \u201cimmoral.\u201d\n\nThe basic argument is that owning things like gun makers or cigarette makers in an index fund makes you an immoral person.\n\nThe reality is that the stock market and the economy do things mostly despite what politicians do, not because they did certain things.\n\nThis is nonsense and I explained it in detail in my ESG article. When you buy stocks on a secondary market, you aren\u2019t funding the company. You aren\u2019t making that company any more capable of achieving success. You are literally just buying an existing share of stock from someone else. The firm already raised capital. They don\u2019t care who owns the stock, and that stock is going to trade at a value that reflects its fundamentals, not your personal feelings.\n\nSo choosing not to own certain stocks on a secondary market is just another form of higher-fee stock picking. And, in fact, by choosing to pick stocks and pay higher fees you will end up underperforming a similar plain-vanilla, low-cost index fund that will hurt your ability to fund the causes you want.\n\nIn other words, you\u2019re being immoral by choosing to earn a lower return than you otherwise would because you have less money to fund righteous causes.\n\nI am 100% in favor of moral investing. But it\u2019s important to understand that what\u2019s moral to you is not moral to someone else. And so it\u2019s silly to use the secondary markets as a place to try to boycott a firm because it will have virtually no impact on their actual operations, and it will hurt your ability to operate morally.\n\nIf you want to boycott a company, do it on the primary market, where these firms actually obtain funding and sell goods and services. But don\u2019t fall for the high-fee stock-picking sales pitch about what it means to invest \u201cmorally.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cFractional reserve banking\u201d is still a thing. Joe Weisenthal had a nice post up on Bloomberg about how silly it is to think of things like quantitative easing (QE) as \u201cmoney printing.\u201d This evolved on Twitter into a big discussion about \u201cfractional reserve banking,\u201d in which a group of well-known economists kept referring to this concept of how banks operate by leveraging a fraction of their reserves. This is an impeachable idea.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nIn the most famous macroeconomic textbooks, the money multiplier is taught to everyone. It follows a simple causal path: The Federal Reserve lends $100 and banks can then multiply that by 10 times or whatever.\n\nThe implication is that the Fed has a rather tight control over the money supply and the way that banks make loans.\n\nThis idea came under fire during the financial crisis when the Fed expanded its balance sheet with very little lending follow-through. There were lots of bad excuses for why banks weren\u2019t lending, but the reality is that we finally learned that this textbook treatment of the money multiplier is wrong, at worst, and misleading, at best.\n\nAnd so it showed that the series of asset swaps that the Fed was engaged in had a far less powerful impact over the economy than many presumed they would.\n\nThe point is, the whole concept of \u201cfractional reserve banking\u201d is broken. Yes, banks hold reserves as a fraction of their assets. But we shouldn\u2019t be misled to think that this implies some sort of causal relationship between the price and quantity of reserves and the way banks expand their balance sheets.\n\nAnyhow, I am either very bad at teaching this concept or it is immensely hard to understand because I can\u2019t seem to impeach this idea from the world even though I\u2019ve been harping on it for 10-plus years.\n\n3. Wait, actual impeachment? Here\u2019s an article I wrote in 2018 about the possibility of Trump being impeached.\n\nSome people throw a hissy fit when I talk about this. I am not being political. Trump operates like a maverick. He doesn\u2019t follow the rules and that sometimes gets him in hot water. So I\u2019ve always viewed impeachment as a very real possibility because he\u2019s always toeing a rather unconventional line.\n\nBut it\u2019s important not to mix our politics with our investing. The economy is much bigger than any one person and that\u2019s the key point of my 2018 piece. We often allude to this idea that the stock market did this or that under president so and so, but the reality is that the stock market and the economy do things mostly despite what politicians do, not because they did certain things.\n\nSo let\u2019s not go falling for scary media narratives about the economy and the markets just because President Trump may or may not get impeached.\n\nCullen Roche is the author of the Pragmatic Capitalism blog, where this column first appeared.
