When you count on the most hilarious epic movies Bollywood has ever made, seldom would you forget this epic movie.\n\nTwitter\n\nIt has been about four decades that the film released, and it is still very relevant and funny, isn\u2019t it? Naseeruddin Shah, however, maintains that he never found the movie to be funny while he was shooting for it.\n\nTwitter\n\n\u201cI never thought it would get completed. I didn\u2019t find it funny while we were making it. I didn\u2019t find anything funny. When I read the script, I did. But while performing, no. That possibly worked for the film because if you find yourself funny the audience is not going to find it funny. You will be laughing at your own joke,\u201d he said during a session at the India Film, as quoted by Indian Express.\n\nTwitter\n\nDon't Miss 1.7 K SHARES 17.5 K SHARES 8.8 K SHARES 2 K SHARES 1.7 K SHARES\n\nAbout two years ago, it was announced that Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro sequel is in the works.\n\nTwitter\n\n\u201cWe are doing Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro sequel. The script is ready. Kundanji had written it. Naseeruddin Shah is reprising his role. We will have someone else for Raviji's part as he is no longer with us.
