Some protesters waved the U.S. flag and carried \"Uncle Sam\" recruitment posters reading \"Fight for Freedom, Stand with HK\".\n\n\"All of the Hong Kong people feel hopeless and the government hasn\u2019t listened to our voices so we need the USA to help us,\" said protester Edward Fong, 28.\n\nThe protesters are angry at what they see as Beijing's tightening grip on the city which was guaranteed 50 years of freedoms under the \"one country, two systems\" formula under which it returned to China. Beijing rejects the charge and accuses Western countries, especially the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.\n\nThe unrest poses the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. He warned that any attempt to divide China would be crushed.\n\n\"Anyone attempting to split China in any part of the country will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones,\u201d Xi said in a meeting on Sunday with leaders in Nepal, where he was visiting, according to China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV.\n\n\n\n\n\n'THEY ARE RIOTERS, CRIMINALS'\n\nIn contrast to Monday night's peaceful protest, rallies descended into chaos on Sunday with running skirmishes between protesters and police in shopping malls and on the streets.\n\nBlack-clad activists threw 20 petrol bombs at one police station, while others trashed shops and metro stations.\n\nA crude explosive device, which police said was similar to those used in \"terrorist attacks\", was remotely detonated as a police car drove past and officers were clearing roadblocks on Sunday night.\n\nA police officer also had his neck slashed by a protester.\n\n\"Violence against police has reached a life-threatening level,\" said Deputy Commissioner of Police Tang Ping-keung.\n\n\"They are not protesters, they are rioters and criminals. Whatever cause they are fighting for it never justifies such violence.\"\n\nProtests have attracted millions of people but have gradually become smaller in recent weeks. Yet violence by hardcore activists has risen, prompting debate over tactics. But they say they remained united.\n\n\"Violence is always undesirable, but in the case of Hong Kong, we have no other option,\" said regular protester Jackson Chan, 21.\n\n\"In June, 2 million took to the street and demonstrated peacefully, yet the government showed a complete disregard to the public opinion... Escalation of violence is inevitable,\" Chan said.\n\nOn Monday, speakers called on U.S. senators to vote for the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, saying it would be their \"most powerful weapon\".\n\nThe bill supports human rights in Hong Kong with measures under consideration such as annual reviews of its special economic status and sanctions on those who undermine its autonomy. The text will not be finalised until it passes both houses of Congress and is signed by the president.", "description": "Tens of thousands of mostly young pro-democracy activists rallied in Hong Kong on Monday in the first legal protest since the introduction of colonial-era emergency laws and pleaded for help from the United States.", "authors": ["John Ruwitch", "Jessie Pang"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F0Y7SD52J4h67HRKLy5sjQ--~B/aD0yOTg0O3c9NDQ4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/650bb180-ee6a-11e9-b79f-da00bfc644fa", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
