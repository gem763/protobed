Not one question about the climate crisis. Not one question about LGBTQ+ rights. Not one question about immigration. These issues are too important to ignore. #DemDebate \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) October 16, 2019\n\nWhile it is true that the debate did not focus on any of those subjects, CNN recently hosted a seven-hour town hall entirely devoted to climate change, as well as a marathon town hall on LGBT rights.\n\nCNN has not, however, held a town hall event devoted entirely to immigration \u2013 a topic of interest to voters on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nFormer presidential candidate Gov.
