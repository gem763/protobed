One, of course, is to acquit him on the facts. Democrats haven\u2019t proven their case. Not guilty. And that\u2019s that. The problem with that approach as a political matter is that no one\u2019s sure yet what facts might still come to light. If Democrats make a convincing case, a rubber-stamped \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict in the Senate might hurt Republicans. And of course some Trump critics would tell you that there are already facts in the record that warrant removal from office, namely, Trump asking Ukraine\u2019s president to look into whether the Democratic frontrunner for president and his son did anything shady there. That\u2019s in the transcript the White House itself produced.\n\nSo dispensing with impeachment on the facts is risky. What\u2019s less risky is dispensing with impeachment on the law. If the GOP argues right out of the chute that the president\u2019s been accused of something that doesn\u2019t amount to a high crime or misdemeanor then it doesn\u2019t matter what evidence Democrats produce. If the abuse of power doesn\u2019t rise to the level of something that warrants removal from office then Republicans don\u2019t need to bother with the facts. We don\u2019t send people to prison for traffic tickets. We don\u2019t remove presidents from office for, uh, attempting to influence the coming election by blowing up the other party\u2019s candidate on the launchpad with a foreign corruption investigation.\n\nAnd the beauty of this argument is that it allows Republicans to soothe angry voters by acknowledging that what Trump did was wrong. \u201cYou\u2019re right, it was terrible. You have every right to be disgusted. We share your contempt. But no, this isn\u2019t impeachment-worthy.\u201d Trump gets to stay in office and voters end up kinda sorta mollified by Trump being lightly shamed by his own party. Everyone wins!\n\nThe first prominent proponent of the \u201cbad but not impeachable\u201d view that I\u2019m aware of was Tucker Carlson, who co-wrote a piece last week with Neil Patel for the Daily Caller that got some attention online. \u201cEven Tucker admits that what Trump did was wrong!\u201d Yes, but. Don\u2019t miss the fine print: Not impeachable.\n\nThe key question with Trump\u2019s Ukraine call, though, is whether the president\u2019s actions, advisable or not, rise to the level of an impeachable offense. It\u2019s hard to argue they do. The president did not, as was first reported, offer a quid pro quo to the Ukrainians. He did not condition any U.S. support on a Biden investigation. The Justice Department has already looked at the totality of the call and determined that Trump did not break the law.\n\nIf all the GOP needs to do to be rid of its impeachment mess is admit that the guy on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape is of dubious character, a fact everyone outside his own base has long since accepted, then they\u2019re off practically scot-free. \u201cBad but not impeachable\u201d places Ukraine in the overflowing pot of things the president has done that are embarrassing but essentially just part of the price of going full MAGA. If you like the sweet stuff, like a roaring economy and Justice Gorsuch, occasionally you have to stomach the bitter stuff. Like him leaning on a foreign head of state to help torpedo a would-be election opponent.\n\nAll of this is background to today\u2019s news: The \u201cBad but not impeachable\u201d argument now has a Republican advocate in the U.S. Senate. And it\u2019s not someone whom you\u2019d expect to see on Carlson\u2019s primetime Fox show.\n\n\u201cThe president should not have raised the Biden issue on that call, period. It\u2019s not appropriate for a president to engage a foreign government in an investigation of a political opponent,\u201d [Rob] Portman said after attending the 4th Annual Ohio Defense Forum, hosted by The Dayton Development Coalition in Columbus\u2019 Westin Great Southern Hotel. \u201cI don\u2019t view it as an impeachable offense. I think the House frankly rushed to impeachment assuming certain things\u201d that haven\u2019t panned out yet\u2026 While impeachment is not merited, Portman said a bipartisan group such as the Senate Intelligence Committee could investigate the whistleblowers\u2019 allegations surrounding Trump. \u201cEverything should be looked at,\u201d Portman said, including accusations that the FBI was politicized in 2016.\n\nInterestingly, Portman also acknowledged that the Ukrainian prosecutor who was targeted by Biden in 2016 and also by a group of U.S. senators (including Portman himself) was in their crosshairs not because he was too aggressive in going after Burisma but because he wasn\u2019t aggressive enough in fighting corruption. Trump has tried to claim that the prosecutor was removed because he was too much of a threat to Hunter Biden; not really, Portman\u2019s admitting here. He also admitted that he asked administration officials repeatedly this summer why the $250 million in military aid to Ukraine had been held up by Trump. Neither Mike Pence, SecDef Mark Esper, nor anyone else had an explanation, in case you\u2019re wondering if the \u201cquid pro quo\u201d possibility is still alive.\n\nAnyway, will Trump tolerate the Carlson/Portman defense that he\u2019s guilty of misconduct but not impeachable misconduct? He\u2019s transactional by nature; if adopting this position gets him through the impeachment wars with his job intact, one would think he\u2019d agree to the transaction. But he\u2019s also deeply narcissistic and resents being called out for bad behavior. He\u2019s described his phone call with Zelensky repeatedly as \u201cperfect.\u201d What will it do to his legacy to skate on a \u201ccorrupt, but not corrupt enough\u201d defense? Because he is worried about his legacy, you know:\n\nIn a phone call with House Republicans on Friday, Trump articulated why he really doesn\u2019t want this. Impeachment, Trump said, is a \u201cbad thing to have on your resume,\u201d according to a source on the call. Two other sources on the call confirmed the substance of the comment, but one said they recalled Trump phrasing it as \u201cyou don\u2019t want it [impeachment] on your resume.\u201d\u2026 [S]ources who have discussed impeachment candidly with the president say these comments perfectly encapsulate how Trump feels about it: He believes it could help him get re-elected and win back the House. But he doesn\u2019t want the history books recording Donald Trump as an impeached president.\n\nHe almost certainly will end up being impeached no matter what Republicans do or say. The question is whether at that point he\u2019ll accept any ol\u2019 justification in the name of winning in the Senate, in which \u201cbad but not impeachable\u201d is fine, or whether he\u2019ll insist that Senate Republicans grit their teeth and vouch for the propriety of his call with Zelensky in the name of vindicating him for the historical record. Call that approach \u201cgood and unjustly impeached\u201d if you like. If I were him I\u2019d make Senate Republicans as comfortable as possible in finding reasons to acquit him, knowing that winning reelection next fall will operate as a verdict for posterity by voters that he was wrongly impeached. But Trump craves loyalty and it\u2019ll bug him to watch McConnell\u2019s crew, who are normally so obsequious, badmouthing him during the impeachment process even with the assurance that they\u2019ll vote his way in the end. He might make this more contentious than it needs to be. I mean, he usually does.\n\nExit question: \u201cBad but not impeachable\u201d is a better defense at least than \u201clol the president\u2019s a troll don\u2019t take him seriously,\u201d no?", "description": "Nuance.", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/t-10.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
