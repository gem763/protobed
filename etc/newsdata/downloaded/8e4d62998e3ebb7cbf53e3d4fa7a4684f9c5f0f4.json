Only thing is that they should have not done it. For that they apologized so we accept it,\u201d said Saeed Uddin, honorary secretary of the Islamic Community Fund of Hong Kong.\n\nDuring Sunday\u2019s protest, a police water cannon truck that was passing by the mosque suddenly sprayed a stinging blue-dyed liquid at a handful of people standing in front of its gate, according to video of the incident by pro-democracy lawmaker Jeremy Tam.\n\nThe mosque\u2019s front steps, metal gate and sidewalk outside were stained with the blue liquid while the people caught in the plume were left gagging, coughing and trying to rinse the solution from their eyes, the video shows.\n\nVolunteers later arrived to help clean up, and by Monday morning the blue coating was largely gone.\n\nTam said on his Facebook page that he and two others, an Indian businessman and the head of a charity for ethnic minorities, went to the hospital to check for injuries.\n\nLocal broadcaster RTHK reported the people outside the mosque were there to guard it.\n\nHong Kong authorities scrambled to minimize the fallout from the incident, which protesters seized on as the latest example of what they call unnecessarily harsh police tactics.\n\nPolice used the water cannon along with tear gas and pepper spray to battle protesters who remained on the streets after the end of an unauthorized rally, vandalizing and setting fire to shops with mainland China ties. They were rallying to call for broader political rights and police accountability, in the latest turmoil to grip the financial center since early June.\n\nHong Kong is home to more than 300,000 Muslims, according to the Islamic Community Fund, which runs the city\u2019s five mosques and two Muslim cemeteries. They first arrived in the 19th century after being recruited in India by British colonizers.\n\nPolice said Sunday the spraying was an accident and sent representatives to meet with mosque leaders.\n\n\u201cIt is most unfortunate that the dispersal operation has caused unintended impact on the Kowloon Mosque,\u201d the force said on its Facebook page.\n\nLater Monday, organizers planned an evening sit-in at a suburban train station on the three-month anniversary of a violent attack there on protesters by men with suspected organized crime ties.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s subway operator said it would close the station by early afternoon in an apparent bid to foil the protesters, who have trashed and torched subway facilities in anger at the operator\u2019s support for authorities.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Hong Kong officials apologized to Muslim leaders after riot police sprayed a mosque and bystanders with a water cannon", "authors": ["Kelvin Chan"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/mosque_water_cannon_apology_hong_kong.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
