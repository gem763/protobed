Another trade, made shortly before Mr Trump announced a delay in tariffs on Chinese goods, made $190m. The biggest trade of all came on June 28, while Mr Trump was at the G20 meeting. There, he met with President Xi and announced trade negotiations were \"back on track.\"\n\nThose trades ended up being worth $1.8bn thanks to an 84 point boost in the S&P 500 index following Trump's announcement.\n\nPresident Donald Trump participates in a meeting with leaders of the steel and aluminum industries at the White House: Win McNamee/Getty Images More\n\nThough the story quotes an unnamed commodities trader as saying \u201cthere\u2019s something fishy going on\u201d, other analysts disagree. One who spoke to Bloomberg said that without the trading records, insider trading would be impossible to prove, and that in the futures market, trades that make large amounts of money fast are actually not uncommon. It's even impossible to know how if all that money went to one entity or perhaps several who happened to make a lucky bet.\n\n\u201cMillions of futures contracts trade a day, billions of dollars trade a day, so to make a connection, I feel like it\u2019s very hard to do,\u201d Michael O\u2019Rourke of JonesTrading told Bloomberg.\n\nAccording to Slate, just knowing when trades happen isn\u2019t enough to prove how much money they made - you\u2019d also need to know how long the buyer held onto those shares.\n\nThere's no suggestion in the article that Mr Trump or anyone in his circle is involved in insider trading.\n\nWhether or not the story itself holds up - the author admits that it\u2019s impossible to know who is making these trades without an SEC investigation - Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have both said that they believe Trump\u2019s tweets affect the markets. JPMorgan even created its now famous Volfefe Index - a combination of the Trump tweet typo \u201ccovfefe\u201d and \u201cvolatility - to track the effects of the President\u2019s tweets on the US bond markets.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, tweets with the words \u201cChina,\u201d \u201cproducts,\u201d \u201cbillion,\u201d \u201cgreat,\u201d and \u201cDemocrats\u201d were most tightly correlated with market movement.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump delays tariffs in China trade war as 'goodwill gesture'", "description": "*/Unknown actors may have made billions from the turmoil Donald Trump has created in the markets through erratic tweets, shoot-from-the-hip foreign policy, and the trade war with China, according to a new report.", "authors": ["Vittoria Elliott"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nRH_I3mo.B5f5RSEJg_pGg--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/9d09bf3e74dbcb40c31ffb370f3ceb95", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
