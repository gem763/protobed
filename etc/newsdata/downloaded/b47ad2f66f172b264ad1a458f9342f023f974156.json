FOREX-Dollar buoyed as markets digest oil shock; Aussie sold\n\n* Dollar broadly supported as investors look to Fed\n\n* Australian dollar falls after dovish RBA minutes\n\n* Oil exporter currencies hold gains\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n\n\nBy Hideyuki Sano and Tom Westbrook\n\nTOKYO/SINGAPORE, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The greenback found\n\nbroad support on Tuesday amid the geo-political, and economic\n\nuncertainties cast by the attacks on Saudi oil facilities, while\n\nthe Australian dollar was sharply sold after a dovish readout\n\nfrom the central bank.\n\nOil prices pulled back from soaring heights touched on\n\nMonday, and the yen and Swiss franc gave up gains\n\ndriven by knee-jerk safe-haven buying. O/R\n\nThe dollar rose to its strongest since Aug. 1 against the\n\nyen, touching 108.36 yen, helped also by U.S. President Donald\n\nTrump announcing he'd struck trade agreements with Tokyo.\n\nMoves were slight, however, as traders await outcome of the\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting on Wednesday, with strong\n\nexpectations for a cut in interest rates, and Bank of Japan\n\nmeeting on Thursday that could result in more stimulus.\n\n\"The market is in limbo between the oil price shock and the\n\nFed meeting,\" said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at Gain\n\nCapital in Singapore.\n\n\"Like any price shock, people go: 'What the hell has\n\nhappened? What do we make of that...it didn't really spill over\n\nto currency markets like we might have expected.\"\n\nThe dollar index held on to Monday's gains to stand\n\nat 98.609. The euro stood a touch stronger at $1.1010 ,\n\nwhile the Swiss franc weakened slightly to $0.9919.\n\nThe Chinese yuan wavered, shedding 0.3%, as a lack of news\n\nahead of meetings scheduled on Thursday between junior U.S. and\n\nChinese trade officials began to sap markets' optimism about\n\nchances of a breakthrough in negotiations to end a protracted\n\ntariff war. The biggest major mover among major currencies was the\n\nAustralian dollar AUD=D3 , which dropped 0.4% to an 11-day low,\n\ndragging the New Zealand dollar NZD=D3 with it, after the\n\nReserve Bank of Australia flagged an easing bias in meeting\n\nminutes. \"They no longer talk about an accumulation of evidence in\n\norder to ease again, and highlight risks to the global economy,\"\n\nsaid National Australia Bank Senior FX Strategist Rodrigo\n\nCatril. \"It certainly sounds a lot more dovish than before.\"\n\nAnother factor boosting the greenback on Tuesday was some\n\nexiting of bearish dollar bets in advance of the U.S. Federal\n\nReserve's two-day policy meeting.\n\nTraders widely expect the Fed will cut interest rates by a\n\nquarter of a percentage point on Wednesday.\n\nBut their certainty around the timing has faltered in recent\n\ndays, with the probability that the Fed will stand pat rising\n\nfrom about a fifth to 33% this week, while expectations for two\n\nmore rounds of cuts by Christmas remain intact. FEDWATCH\n\n\"Markets are pricing in two additional rate cuts by next\n\nyear but the Fed is unlikely to make such a forecast, so we\n\ncould see further gain in the dollar,\" said Yukio Ishizuki,\n\nsenior strategist at Daiwa Securities.\n\nOil-producing currencies clung to Monday's gains in the wake\n\nof attacks that have cut Saudi Arabia's production in half.\n\nYemen's anti-government Houthi movement, an ally of Iran,\n\nclaimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday said it looked\n\nlike Iran was behind the strikes but stressed he did not want to\n\ngo to war. Iran has rejected the U.S. charges.\n\nThe Norwegian crown gained almost 1% Monday to trade at\n\n9.8565 per euro EURNOK= while the Russian rouble\n\nEURRUBTN=MCX hit a near seven-week high against the euro.\n\nEach held those gains in Asian trade while oil importer\n\ncurrencies weakened, with the South Korean won retreating\n\nfurther from a two-month high touched on Monday, dropping 0.4%,\n\nwhile the Taiwan dollar shed 0.2%.\n\n\n\n", "description": "FOREX-Dollar buoyed as markets digest oil shock; Aussie sold", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB8107I_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
