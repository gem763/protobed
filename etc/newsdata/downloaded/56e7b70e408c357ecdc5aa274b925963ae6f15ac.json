What is windshear?", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Airplane wings are not always in the middle of the plane. USA TODAY\n\nQuestion: I've noticed that the wings aren\u2019t placed in the middle of the plane but at nearly the rear of the plane. Why is this? \u2013 Christian, California\n\nAnswer: I would not say that wings are near the rear of the plane, but they are not always in the exact middle. Wing placement is decided based on fuel efficiency and on the loading capabilities (weight and balance). Wings create lift, keeping the plane in the air. They are balanced by the small wing in the tail known as the horizontal stabilizer. This wing is upside down, so the lift is created downward. By balancing the two points of lift, the pilots can maintain control of the airplane.\n\nAs the payload (passengers, cargo and fuel) is added, the location is important to ensure the pilot remains capable of maintaining control with the horizontal stabilizer. Due to the great number of combinations of payloads, designers do all they can to provide a wide envelope for loading. The length of the fuselage, engine placement are additional factors in determining the loading envelope.\n\nQ: Can you explain windshear and the effects that has on airplanes? \u2013 Timothy Nealon, Ph.D San Antonio\n\nA: Windshear is the amount of change in wind direction or velocity over a short distance. This can be a source of turbulence as the airplane travels through a changing air mass.\n\nOne example of windshear's effect on an airplane could be a change in the ground speed. As a tailwind becomes a headwind, the ground speed would slow down. In extreme cases, a change in direction can cause a loss of airspeed with a resulting reduction in lift.\n\nLoading...\n\nThere have been a number of windshear accidents in the past, caused by the combination of a massive change in wind direction with a vertical component (microburst) pushing the airplane into the ground. The last one of these was US Air 1016 in July 1994. Normally the cause of the windshear and microburst are thunderstorms.\n\nTechnology has dramatically improved the ability to detect wind shear that could pose a risk to the airplane. Airliners have wind shear detection equipment onboard to warn pilots when the conditions are present for windshear. Pilots are trained to avoid these conditions.\n\nJohn Cox is a retired airline captain with US Airways and runs his own aviation safety consulting company, Safety Operating Systems.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/cox/2019/10/04/ask-captain-wing-placement-and-windshear/3850605002/", "description": "This week, retired pilot John Cox explains what windshear is and how it affects planes.
