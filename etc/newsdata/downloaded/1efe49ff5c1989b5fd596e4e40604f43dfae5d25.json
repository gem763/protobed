Biden\u2019s son Hunter sat on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that had faced international scrutiny.\n\nBut Sondland added that he did not realize \u201cuntil much later\u201d that Giuliani was seeking a Ukrainian-led investigation into Biden and his son. He said any effort to solicit foreign assistance in an American election \u2014 an allegation central to the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry \u2014 \u201cwould be wrong.\u201d\n\nHe also said military assistance to Ukraine \u201cshould not have been delayed for any reason\u201d \u2014 a rebuke of the president\u2019s decision to put a hold on those funds in August \u2014 but added that Trump repeatedly told him there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d involving the aid or the investigation of Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\nSondland\u2019s testimony has the potential to be the most devastating yet for Trump\u2019s defenders, who say he did not apply inappropriate pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a 2020 rival. It was Sondland\u2019s text messages denying the existence of a quid pro quo, obtained by Congress earlier this month, that Trump pointed to as proof he did nothing untoward.\n\nSondland\u2019s testimony also underscores the outsized influence Giuliani had on Trump, even though the former New York City mayor is not a government official.\n\n\u201cIt was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the president\u2019s mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani,\u201d Sondland said.\n\nThe House\u2019s impeachment inquiry has centered on Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelensky, during which Trump asked his counterpart for a \u201cfavor\u201d involving an investigation of Biden. Democrats have pointed to the ask as evidence that Trump abused the power of his office.\n\nThe inquiry also focuses on the decision to freeze critical military assistance to Ukraine. House impeachment investigators are looking into whether Trump sought to use the withheld aid as leverage over Zelensky as the president sought probes into his political enemies.\n\nSondland\u2019s attorneys in a letter to House investigators say he has ample documentation to back up his testimony but that the White House and State Department are blocking him from sharing it, claiming it could implicate executive privilege and other confidentiality restrictions.\n\n\u201c[Sondland] strongly believes that disclosure will lead to a more fulsome and accurate inquiry into the matters at issue and will corroborate the testimony that he will give in key respects,\u201d Sondland\u2019s attorneys wrote in a Thursday letter. \u201cHowever, the choice is not his to make, and so we must regretfully decline to produce the documents that the committees have requested from Ambassador Sondland.\u201d\n\nSondland now says he only claimed there was no quid pro quo because Trump repeatedly assured him of it in a direct phone call \u2014 regardless of whether it was true.\n\n\u201cAnd I recall the president was in a bad mood,\u201d Sondland intends to say.\n\nSondland will also offer a strong defense of the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, who was ousted by Trump after a campaign by the president\u2019s allies to recall her to Washington. In his opening statement, Sondland calls her \u201can excellent diplomat with a deep command of Ukrainian internal dynamics, the U.S.-Ukraine relationship, and associated regional issues.\u201d\n\nTrump himself blasted Yovanovitch during his July 25 call Zelensky, and Yovanovitch testified to lawmakers last week that her removal was based on \u201cunfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d\n\nSondland, who says he\u2019s a \u201clifelong Republican,\u201d noted he was confirmed on a voice vote in the Senate in 2018 and said he tried to operate in a nonpartisan manner in his diplomatic role and added that he had previously worked with Biden on the former vice president\u2019s anti-cancer initiative.\n\nHe noted that Ukraine played an important part in his broader work as EU ambassador since he took his post.\n\n\u201cUkraine is not a dirty word. Ukraine is a fragile democracy fighting against a brutal and unscrupulous Russian neighbor,\u201d he said. \u201cA strong Ukraine helps to uphold the norms that maintain stability and promote prosperity around the world.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f3/e3/c1df6ea149178f32e6689c938696/191017-sondald-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
