Musa did not respond to their questions.\n\nShivambu took to Twitter on Friday to further dismiss the \"lies\", saying the difference paid was nowhere near R1m and the car was financed \"long before any VBS\".\n\nShivambu has repeatedly denied ever benefiting from money looted from VBS Mutual Bank, despite reports to the contrary.\n\nNews24 previously reported that he denied receiving R10m from VBS, in his first direct response to the allegations against him and his brother, Brian.\n\nOne of Brian Shivambu's companies, Sgameka Projects, is often mentioned in investigations into the VBS looting scandal.\n\nThe Daily Maverick's Scorpio investigative team recently mapped out a money trail from VBS to Sgameka Projects \u2013 effectively a shell company \u2013 to Mahuna Investments, a company owned by EFF leader Julius Malema's cousin, Matsobane Phaleng.\n\nMalema allegedly used the Mahuna Investments account as his \"personal slush fund\", which he has also denied.\n\n- Compiled by Denver Keytle", "description": "EFF deputy leader Floyd Shivambu is once more under the microscope following a report that Hawks investigators were probing his alleged \"cash\" purchase of a high-end Range Rover Sport.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8076/5b30920cc9ff40dda173f28031279f5d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
