(AP) - In eliminating California\u2019s authority to set its own emission standards for cars and trucks, the Trump administration would take away leverage the state needs to convince the world\u2019s largest automakers to make more environmentally friendly vehicles.\n\nBut one California lawmaker is already working on a way to preserve at least some of the state\u2019s environmental muscle: rebates for electric cars.\n\nCalifornia residents who buy or lease a zero-emission vehicle can get up to $7,000 from the state. A bill by Democratic Assemblyman Phil Ting would mean people could only get that money if they buy a car from a company that has agreed to follow California\u2019s emission standards.\n\nThe proposal comes as the Trump administration on Wednesday announced it was revoking California\u2019s authority to set its own auto emission standards - authority it has had for decades under a waiver from the federal Clean Air Act.\n\nCalifornia has 35 million registered vehicles, giving it outsized influence with the auto industry. That heft was on display in July, when Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom announced four automakers - Ford, BMW, Honda and Volkswagen - agreed to follow California\u2019s standards, bypassing the Trump administration, which had been working on new rules.\n\nCalifornia officials have been negotiating with other automakers to follow suit, but those talks stalled Wednesday when Trump announced, via Twitter, that he was revoking California\u2019s authority to set its own emission standards.\n\nBut Ting\u2019s proposal, first reported by CalMatters, shows California has other ways it could entice automakers to follow its environmental lead. David Vogel, a professor emeritus of business ethics at the Haas School of Business of the University of California-Berkeley, noted California could accomplish its goals through various tax changes, which the federal government could not stop.\n\n\u201cEven if the Trump administration would win on this, California could use taxes to accomplish much of the same goals,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cThe federal government would have less of an ability to challenge, because states can pretty much tax who they want.\u201d\n\nThe California Legislature adjourned for the year last week. But before they left, they amended Assembly Bill 40 to include the new language so they could debate it when they return to work in January.\n\nState officials could use the tactic to aid negotiations with Toyota and General Motors, two manufacturers that make electric cars but have so far not agreed to California\u2019s emission standards. It\u2019s unclear how effective the law would be as California\u2019s Clean Vehicle Rebate Project has a waiting list.\n\nA Toyota spokesman declined to comment.\n\nTing, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment. But he is scheduled to speak with reporters about the issue on Thursday.\n\nAsked about the proposal on Wednesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he would make an announcement by Friday, but he did not elaborate.\n\nIn a tweet, Trump said his action to revoke California\u2019s authority to set its own emission standards would result in less expensive, safer cars. He also predicted Americans would purchase more new cars, which would result in cleaner air as older models are taken off the roads.\n\n\u201cMany more cars will be produced under the new and uniform standard, meaning significantly more JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to California, you will be out of business,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nU.S. automakers contend that without year-over-year increases in fuel efficiency that align with global market realities their vehicles could be less competitive, potentially resulting in job losses. However, most of the industry favors increases in standards that are less than the Obama-era requirements, saying their consumers are gravitating to SUVs and trucks rather than buying more efficient cars.\n\nTop California officials and environmental groups pledged legal action on Wednesday to stop the rollback, potentially tying up the issue for years in federal courts. The U.S. transportation sector is the nation\u2019s biggest single source of greenhouse gasses.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that his proposal would result in a cleaner environment is contrary to his own administration\u2019s estimate that by freezing economy standards, U.S. fuel consumption would increase by about 500,000 barrels per day, a 2% to 3% increase. Environmental groups predict even more fuel consumed, resulting in higher pollution.\n\nThe administration argues that lower-cost vehicles would allow more people to buy new ones that are safer, cutting roadway deaths by 12,700 lives through the 2029 model year. But The Associated Press reported last year that internal EPA emails show senior career officials privately questioned the administration\u2019s calculations, saying the proposed freeze would actually modestly increase highway fatalities, by about 17 deaths annually.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In eliminating California's authority to set its own emission standards for cars and trucks, the Trump administration would take away leverage the state needs to convince the world's largest automakers to make more environmentally friendly vehicles.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Adam Beam", "Michael Biesecker"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/trump-fuel_economy_11652_c0-191-2355-1564_s1770x1032.jpg?e8a1ac1da2fdfdc299ddb12472fd73f55376042a", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
