However they remain hopeful of finding a new home for the hugely popular show on another network.\n\n\u201cJust to confirm the rumours! It\u2019s true that NITV-SBS has decided after 10 successful years and there [sic] most popular show not to continue with the Marngrook Footy Show. We are hopeful of continuing on another network.\u201d \u201cWe thank all our fans and supporters for your support to the program over 12 years!\u201d\n\nThe backlash to the decision on social media has already been vehement, with fans expressing disgust at the decision all morning.\n\nSo NITV axe the very popular Marngrook Footy Show. And I see they\u2019re now showing Fraggle Rock.\n\nI thought the I stood for Indigenous TV ????????\u200d\u2640\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/0oLQB8MPNL \u2014 flashblak (@flashblak) October 29, 2019\n\nnup to marngrook footy show being cancelled it\u2019s the only panel show that actually cuts through straight to the spirit of the game and reminds us of the necessity of having Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices at the forefront of our game \u2014 andie (@anndeejam) October 29, 2019\n\nThis is outrageous. Marngrook is the best football show on TV. It should be on a network somewhere. https://t.co/k5YWYzuD6s \u2014 Preston Towers (@prestontowers) October 29, 2019\n\nWhat on earth is going on in footy media? If Marngrook doesn't get picked up it'd be worthy of a royal commission \u2014 Michael Thompson (@mikkithompson93) October 29, 2019\n\nYour week in media then \u2013 Marngrook Footy Show cancelled\n\n\u2013 Neroli Meadows Fired\n\n\u2013 More Tom Morris!

It first began life on Melbourne\u2019s community station Channel 31, before it shifted to ABC2, and then finally to SBS-NITV.\n\nIt won widespread acclaim for its representation of Indigenous and First Nations footballing personalities and players, as well as its balanced and broadly entertaining content, shirking the often-times toxic and repetitive alpha male brouhaha that permeates much of the mainstream footy media.\n\nIt received Logie nominations for for Best Sports Program in both 2015 and 2016.\n\nToday\u2019s axing comes in an otherwise tumultuous week for footy media, following the rather sensational collapse of Macquarie Sports Radio, and the frankly baffling decision by Fox Footy to fire tenured and hugely popular presenter Neroli Meadows.", "description": "SBS and NITV bosses have reportedly brought the axe down on The Marngrook Footy Show, ending the hugely popular footy program after a 12-year run.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/marngrook.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
