She said: \u201cI did not know that. It feels great but in all honesty that wouldn\u2019t even be a conceivable idea if not for the teamwork.\n\n\u201cThe relay is a team event. You can\u2019t do that on your own, so thank you ladies. We hope Imani is OK because we made a last-second change.\n\n\u201cWe made the decision to run a different team and that was just before the call room. That\u2019s testament to all of our experience over the past few years as a relay squad.\n\n\u201cWe can go out there without directly doing the changeovers in the warm-up area and almost run a personal best and get a world silver medal. Maybe a cycle or two ago it would have been an inconceivable idea.\u201d\n\nAdam Gemili, Zharnel Hughes, Richard Kilty and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake ran a European record of 37.36 seconds behind favourites the US, with Japan winning bronze.\n\nGB captain Kilty said: \u201cIt felt incredible. What more could we ask? It took the second-fastest time in history to beat us. That was the best team America have ever assembled.\n\n\u201cZharnel, what a warrior. He pulled his hamstring coming into the zone so we had to slow it down that change and break.\n\n\u201cHe went through a pulled hamstring to deliver me that baton. We\u2019re so proud of each other.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Shara Proctor and Abigail Irozuru qualified for Sunday\u2019s long jump final, but Jazmin Sawyers missed out.\n\nCindy Ofili came through the 100m hurdles heats, finishing third in 12.97s.\n\nIn the women\u2019s 4x400m relay heats Zoey Clark, Jodie Williams, Jessica Turner and Laviai Nielsen reached Sunday\u2019s final in 3:24.99.\n\nThe men\u2019s team of Cameron Chambers, Rabah Yousif, Martyn Rooney and Lee Thompson scraped into the final after Botswana were disqualified.\n\nPA", "description": "Great Britain\u2019s Dina Asher-Smith praised her team-mates after a historic hat-trick at the World Athletics Championships.
