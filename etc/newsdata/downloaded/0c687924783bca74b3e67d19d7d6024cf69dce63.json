It is not, but the meatballs almost always are, and they are wonderful, made with enough bread that they are extremely tender in a bright marinara. Another reliable find is a sandwich of some kind, made with plain, untopped pizza. Twice I\u2019ve had a warm mortadella sandwich there, and both times I was convinced there was no way to improve on it.\n\nOne dish was denoted on the menu by a single word: beans. I\u2019ve thought of it nearly every day since, partly because the beans \u2014 scarlet runners \u2014 were perfectly intact but perfectly tender; partly because of the brooding depth they took on from being finished with sweet red peppers that the kitchen dried and fried, an ingredient the Italians call peperoni cruschi; and partly because their broth tasted so good when given a chance to soak into the slice of thick-crusted sourdough bread that came on top. That bread is Mr. Easton\u2019s, too. It comes with a lot of things, and it is excellent.\n\nBread and Salt is still settling into New Jersey. Some ingredients may be better when Mr. Easton has had time to infiltrate the local farm scene. In August, when the state was rolling in juicy peaches, he was serving crunchy unripe ones in red wine for dessert. There was also a very strange cantaloupe pudding. By September things were looking up; one day there was a scoop of Tristar strawberry sorbet served with anise-seed-flecked polenta gelato, both made by Superiority Burger. (Mr. Easton is friendly with that restaurant\u2019s owner, Brooks Headley, and helped devise the recipe for the focaccia Superiority Burger serves on Fridays.)\n\nAlthough Mr. Easton has a handful of employees, Bread and Salt has some of the blind spots of a one-person operation. It is not the easiest restaurant to communicate with, having an Instagram account but no website or phone. On a recent Sunday, when the restaurant was supposed to open at 1 p.m., a sign on the front door announced that it would be delayed until 1:30. That was the last communiqu\u00e9; the doors were not unlocked until 2.\n\nBut Mr. Easton has a singular vision, and it is the reason the food is so compelling. Looking around at the place, you\u2019re not sure how it can keep going like this. But then the plates start to come out of the kitchen and you don\u2019t want them ever to stop.\n\nFollow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
