The maps show percentage possibility of tropical storm force winds in the United States. Parts of Alabama were covered, usually with 5 percent to 10 percent chances, between Aug. 27 and Sept. 3. Maps on Aug. 30 grew to cover far more of Alabama, but for only 12 hours, and the highest percentage hit 20 percent to 30 percent before quickly shrinking back down.\n\nThe controversy began Sunday morning when Trump tweeted that Florida, \"South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit [much] harder than anticipated\" by Dorian. In response, the National Weather Service's Birmingham office tweeted that Alabama \u201cwill NOT see any impacts from Dorian.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe repeat, no impacts from Hurricane Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east,\" the office said in response to Trump's comments.\n\nBut on Friday, NOAA said that the NWS tweet \"spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\"\n\nThe statement from NOAA contrasts with comments the agency's spokesman, Chris Vaccaro, made Sunday. \"The current forecast path of Dorian does not include Alabama,\" Vaccaro said at the time.\n\nDan Sobien, president of the union representing weather service employees, tweeted Friday, \"Let me assure you the hard working employees of the NWS had nothing to do with the utterly disgusting and disingenuous tweet sent out by NOAA management tonight.\"\n\nOther meteorologists also voiced concerns about NOAA's actions Friday. University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd, former president of the American Meteorology Society, simply responded, \"OMG.\"\n\n\"I am very disappointed to see this statement come out from NOAA,\" Oklahoma University meteorology professor Jason Furtado told The Associated Press. \"I am thankful for the folks at NWS Birmingham for their work in keeping the citizens of Alabama informed and up to date on weather hazards.\"\n\nFurtado said NOAA's statement and the president's Twitter \"war on weather\" are undermining confidence in meteorologists, adding, \"The job just got harder because of this issue.\"\n\nTrump has defended his comments repeatedly this week, insisting that the information he gave Sunday was accurate. On Wednesday, the president held up a map in the Oval Office showing the \u201ccone of uncertainty\u201d over areas possibly affected by the storm. A part of Alabama appeared to be circled in black marker.\n\nTRUMP INSISTS ALABAMA WAS THREATENED BY DORIAN, SHARES FORECAST MODEL\n\nThe media criticized the president over his claims, causing Trump to say Thursday that the coverage was meant to \u201cdemean\u201d him, adding, \u201cWhat I said was accurate!\u201d He posted images of NOAA graphics that at one point projected Dorian\u2019s possible impact on Alabama.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Trump invited Fox News into the Oval Office to emphasize his point that forecasts for Dorian last week had Alabama in the warning cone, providing a graphic from the National Hurricane Center and a screenshot of a news report on NBC.\n\nFox News was also told that Trump was shown a graphic prior to a briefing by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) last week that appeared to show an older forecast track with Dorian going north through the Florida peninsula and just grazing Alabama.\n\nWhen asked why his Sunday morning tweet mentioning Alabama came after the forecast track had moved much farther east, the president seemed to agree that the forecast track had moved but was adamant that at some point, Alabama had been at risk. He also emphasized that on occasions in the past, forecast tracks have changed dramatically.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAlso Thursday, the White House released a statement from Rear Adm. Peter J. Brown, the president\u2019s homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, who said he briefed the president on Sunday about the storm, including \u201cpossible storm impacts well outside the official forecast cone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s comments were based on that morning\u2019s Hurricane Dorian briefing, which included the possibility of tropical storm-force winds in southeastern Alabama,\u201d Brown said.\n\nOn Friday, Trump tweeted: \u201cThe Fake News Media was fixated on the fact that I properly said, at the beginnings of Hurricane Dorian, that in addition to Florida & other states, Alabama may also be grazed or hit. They went Crazy, hoping against hope that I made a mistake (which I didn\u2019t). Check out maps.....\u201d\n\nHe followed up hours later by tweeting: \"Just as I said, Alabama was originally projected to be hit. The Fake News denies it!\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Brooke Singman, John Roberts and Alex Pappas contributed to this report, along with the Associated Press.", "description": "The federal agency that monitors hurricanes said Friday that\u00a0Hurricane Dorian\u00a0could have impacted Alabama, backing claims by President Trump\u00a0that he was right to tweet a warning over the weekend about the storm affecting the state.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/trump-dorian-map-1-AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
