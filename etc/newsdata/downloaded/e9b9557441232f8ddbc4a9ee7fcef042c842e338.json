And of course, Gonski led the seminal reviews of the education system conducted in the last decade.\n\nCommonwealth Bank chairman Catherine Livingstone says the ability to think logically is crucial. Edwina Pickles\n\nChanticleer, who moderated the chat, was struck by how the pair had been shaped by formative education experiences.\n\nLivingstone, whose mother was a teacher, recalled working hard on a composition when she was aged 10. She worked hard at the piece and felt quite pleased with it \u2013 only to be told by the teacher that she could have really done better.\n\n\u201cAnd the message from that was you can always do better than your best. And that has stayed with me really for the rest of my life,\u201d Livingstone said.\n\nGonski, who described himself as a nerdy guy who was never any good at sports, was crestfallen when his marks in maths saw him drop out of the top maths class in Year 11, and into a maths class taught by the sports master. But the encouragement that teacher provided saw him become a life-long mentor and friend to Gonski.\n\nDavid Gonski says a broad and open education is crucial. Graham Jepson\n\nIt was clear that Livingstone and Gonski\u2019s appreciation for the power of great teachers has only grown now they sit at the intersection point of business and education.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the most interesting discussions during the evening was around what Livingstone and Gonski believe the education system needs to instil in students to meet the requirements of a modern workplace.\n\nBoth advocated that in the modern workplace, less is more \u2013 less focus on filling students\u2019 head with as much knowledge as possible, and more focus on leaving space to open minds such that students are taught to think logically and analytically.\n\n\u201cI wonder if we hadn't been too focused on helping students get all of this knowledge versus helping them to think,\u201d Livingstone said.\n\n\u201cI get quite taken aback sometimes when I see something written or proposed, on the lack of logic in developing an argument.\u201d\n\nGonski agreed, recalling his interaction with a person he described as a young billionaire who was keen to push funding and efforts into teaching kids to code above teaching them to read and write.\n\n\u201cI understand his frustration, because he's looking for coders. But the fact is, he's totally wrong,\u201d Gonski said.\n\n\u201cWe have to have a broadness and openness \u2026 knowledge is important, but the analysis of knowledge has to be taught.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the royal commission, there was an absolute crying out for people to ask the question, what should I do, not what can I do? And I would say, I think the universities have wonderful places to teach you that thinking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLivingstone added that the ability to manage complexity and prioritise in a rapidly changing world were also essential, and argued this emphasised the importance of developing continuity between education and employment.\n\nGetting kids into part-time work in their teen years is an important first step but at UTS, every course now has an internship program built in to develop closer links between education and industry.\n\nGonski also questioned how the resume had become so central to recruitment at many companies although, as Livingstone pointed out, some of the blame needed to be shared here with employers.\n\n\u201cI think we have the challenge actually, in terms of the way we recruit, particularly at that real entry-level. And we can make that to do exactly what you say, understanding the individual rather than being mesmerised by their CV or their marks.\u201d\n\nLivingstone also sounded a note of real warning for educators and business people when she recounted a recent discussion with a group of post-graduate students at UTS. She was taken aback to find how fearful they were about the future, and how most couldn\u2019t see how their careers would look beyond five or 10 years.\n\n\u201cThey're actually terrified,\u201d Livingstone said. \u201cSo how do we actually help young people have a positive attitude [and] not be frightened of the future? That, I think, is almost becoming the ultimate challenge of the education system.\u201d", "description": "It's not coding skills that our big bank chairmen want in their staff, but analytical thinking.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5479%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_719%2C$y_171/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a146f68bd659c9a76e44422854735a87f5686bf2", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
