Both nations are armed with nuclear weapons.\n\nA new paper simulates what would happen if India and Pakistan entered into a nuclear war.\n\nThe results suggest that scenario could lead 125 million people to die. Earth\u2019s global temperature could drop by 5 degrees Celsius, which would cause major agricultural challenges.\n\nThe researchers estimate that the disaster could trigger a global famine.\n\nVisit Businessinsider.com for more stories.\n\nPakistan and India have fought three wars over Kashmir, a disputed territory to which both nations lay claim. Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, recently suggested the countries could be headed toward another.\n\n\u201cThere is a potential that two nuclear-armed countries will come face to face at some stage,\u201d Khan said at the United Nations annual summit in September, referring to the Kashmir conflict.\n\nTogether, India and Pakistan possess 2% of the world\u2019s nuclear arsenal: India is estimated to have around 140 nuclear warheads, while Pakistan is estimated to have around 160. But they\u2019re in an arms race to acquire more weapons.\n\nBy 2025, India and Pakistan could have expanded their arsenals to 250 warheads each, according to a new paper that predicts what might happen if the two nations entered into a nuclear war.\n\nIn that extreme scenario, the researchers write, a cloud of black soot could envelop the sky, causing temperatures to fall dramatically. Key agricultural hotspots would lose the ability to grow crops, triggering a global famine.\n\n\u201cIt would be instant climate change,\u201d Alan Robock, an author of the study, told Business Insider. \u201cNothing like this in history, since civilization was developed, has happened.\u201d\n\nHis paper estimates that up to 125 million people could die.\n\nNuclear weapons are becoming more powerful\n\nRobock said the situation outlined in the paper isn\u2019t likely, but it\u2019s possible. So to determine the hypothetical consequences of a nuclear war between Pakistan and India, the researchers sought the advice of military experts.\n\n\u201cWe clearly don\u2019t want to burn cities and see what would happen,\u201d Robock said. \u201cMost scientists have test tubes or accelerators. Nature is our laboratory, so we use models.\u201d\n\nRead more: If a nuclear bomb is dropped on your city, here\u2019s what you should (and shouldn\u2019t) do to stay alive\n\nThe paper doesn\u2019t speculate as to which nation is more likely to initiate a conflict. But it estimates that if India wanted to destroy Pakistan\u2019s major cities, the nation would need to deploy around 150 nuclear weapons. The calculations assume that some of these weapons might miss their target or fail to explode, so the model is based on the explosion of 100 weapons in Pakistan.\n\nIf Pakistan attacked India\u2019s major cities, the researchers estimated, about 150 nuclear weapons would likely go off.\n\ncaption Pakistani soldiers watch over potential Indian troop movements with binoculars on February 23, 2019. source SAJJAD QAYYUM/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIf all of those bombs were 15-kiloton weapons \u2013 the size of the \u201cLittle Boy\u201d atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan \u2013 the researchers predict that 50 million people would die.\n\nBut Robock said the US\u2019 nuclear weapons today are around 100 to 500 kilotons, so it\u2019s likely that India and Pakistan will have acquired more powerful weapons by 2025, the year in which his simulation takes place. If the nations were to use 100-kiloton weapons, the study suggests, that conflict could kill about 125 million people.\n\nA nuclear war between India and Pakistan could wreck Earth\u2019s climate\n\nNuclear explosions produce sweltering heat. Structures catch on fire, and then winds either spread those flames or the fire draws in the surrounding air, creating an even larger blaze known as a firestorm.\n\ncaption An illustration of a nuclear bomb exploding in a city. source Shutterstock\n\nEither way, enormous amounts of smoke would enter the air, the researchers write. A small portion of this smoke would contain \u201cblack carbon,\u201d the sooty material that usually comes from the exhaust of a diesel engine. That substance would then get pumped through the troposphere (the lowest layer of Earth\u2019s atmosphere) and into the stratosphere. Within weeks, black carbon particles could spread across the globe.\n\nIt would be \u201cthe biggest injection of smoke into the stratosphere that we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Robock said.\n\nSmoke particles can linger in the stratosphere for about five years and block out sunlight. In Robock\u2019s simulation, that could cause Earth\u2019s average temperature to drop by up to 5 degrees Celsius. Temperatures could get \u201cas cold as the Ice Age,\u201d he said. With less energy from the sun, the world could also experience up to 30% less rain.\n\nThe researchers estimate that it would take more than a decade for temperatures and precipitation to return to normal. In the meantime, farmers around the world \u2013 especially in India, China, Southeast Asia, Indonesia, tropical South America, and Africa \u2013 would struggle to grow food.\n\nEntire marine ecosystems could also be devastated, which would destroy local fishing economies.\n\nIn sum, the authors write, a nuclear war could trigger mass starvation across the globe.\n\n\u201cAs horrible as the direct effects of nuclear weapons would be, the indirect effects on our food supply would be much worse,\u201d Robock said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Robock has modeled this type of scenario: In 2014, he contributed to a paper that predicted what would happen if India and Pakistan deployed 50 weapons apiece, each with the strength of a \u201cLittle Boy\u201d atomic bomb.\n\nEven that \u201climited\u201d nuclear-war scenario, he found, would cripple the ozone layer, expose people to harmful amounts of ultraviolet radiation, and lower Earth\u2019s surface temperatures for more than 25 years. But those explosions wouldn\u2019t release nearly as much black carbon as the scenario in the newer model, so the cooling effect wouldn\u2019t be as severe.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve been really lucky\u2019\n\nRobock said this type of global climate catastrophe has happened before, but has never been created by humans. He compared the nuclear conflict modeled in the recent paper to the asteroid crash that triggered the extinction of dinosaurs 66 million years ago. That explosion released billions of tons of sulfur into the atmosphere, causing global temperatures to plummet.\n\nRobock emphasized that unlike that disaster, nuclear war is preventable.\n\n\u201cThere are all kinds of ways that something like this could happen, but if nuclear weapons didn\u2019t exist, then it wouldn\u2019t produce a nuclear war,\u201d he said.\n\nA key takeaway of the paper, he said, is that when nations threaten to nuke one another, they threaten their own safety, too. A nuclear war between two countries would \u201caffect everybody in the world, not just where the bombs were dropped,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been really lucky for the last 74 years\u201d since Hiroshima, Robock said. \u201cOur luck might run out sometime.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - Earth's temperature could drop by 5 degrees Celsius, which means major farming regions would struggle to grow crops..
