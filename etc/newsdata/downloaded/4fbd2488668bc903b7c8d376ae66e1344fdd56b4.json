In Shayar county, AFP journalists saw unearthed human bones left discarded in three sites. In other sites. tombs that were reduced to mounds of bricks lay scattered in cleared tracts of land.\n\nThe images appeared as Xinjiang authorities this week claimed their officials were carrying out 'normal' tasks after shocking footage purported to show hundreds of shackled and blindfolded Muslim prisoners being transferred.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Satellite images taken on April 24 in 2018 (left) and September 30 in 2019 (right) show the Sulanim cemetery in Hotan, north-western China's Xinjiang Province, has been knocked down and replaced with a car park.

Rachel Harris, a London-based researcher of Uighur culture\n\nEven sites featuring shrines or the tombs of famous individuals were not spared.\n\nIn Aksu, local authorities turned an enormous graveyard where prominent Uighur poet Lutpulla Mutellip was buried into 'Happiness Park,' with fake pandas, a children's ride, and a man-made lake.\n\nMutellip's grave was like 'a modern day shrine for most nationalist Uighurs, patriotic Uighurs,' recalled Ilshat Kokbore, who visited the tomb in the early 90s and now resides in the US.\n\nThe 'Happiness Park' project saw graves moved to a new cemetery in an industrial zone out in the desert. The caretaker there said he had no knowledge of the fate of Mutellip's remains.\n\nThe Aksu government could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe destruction is 'not just about religious persecution,' said Nurgul Sawut, who has five generations of family buried in Yengisar, southwestern Xinjiang.

It is an issue Beijing itself has acknowledged.\n\nThe government has also been criticised for its irreverence towards burial traditions outside of Xinjiang, including the destruction of coffins in central Jiangxi last year to force locals to cremate.\n\nBut activists and scholars say the clearances are especially egregious in Xinjiang, where they parallel the erasure of other cultural and spiritual sites - including at least 30 mosques and religious sites since 2017, an AFP investigation found in June.\n\n'The destruction of the graveyards is very much part of the wider raft of policies that are going on,' said Rachel Harris, who researches Uighur culture at the School of Oriental and African Studies University of London.\n\n'From the destruction of holy shrines, the tombs of saints, to the destruction of tombs of families, all of this is disrupting the relationship between people and their history, and the relationship between the people and the land that they live on,' she said.\n\nThe official explanation for cemetery removal or relocation varies by site.\n\nThe move to raze Uighur cemeteries is not new - satellite imagery shows destruction from more than a decade ago. Above, a new cemetery is seen on the outskirts of Aksu, Xinjiang where bodies from a destroyed Uighur graveyard were moved\n\nUighurs and ethnic minorities are still exempt from certain policies like cremation, which goes against Islamic tradition, and authorities appear to be hardening their stance, said Rian Thum, a Uighur history expert at the University of Nottingham\n\nThey used to have a 'non-confrontational approach to Uighur culture, but now any policy that attacks Uighur culture seems to get a boost rather than put in check as their approach has changed,' said Thum.

This week, the US said it would curb visas for officials over the alleged abuses and blacklisted 28 Chinese firms it accuses of rights violations\n\nIn Urumqi, the regional capital, a cemetery near the international airport was cleared to make way for an urban 'reconstruction' project.\n\nIn Shayar, where the local government has built new cemeteries near some of the old sites, an official told AFP the programme was aimed at 'standardisation.'\n\nA sign by a new cemetery in Shayar, which replaced a graveyard from the 18th century containing about 7,500 graves, echoed this statement.\n\nThe rebuilt sites 'saved space, protected the ecosystem' and were 'civilised', it said.\n\n'The new cemeteries are standardised, clean, and they're convenient for residents,' Kadier Kasimu, deputy director of Shayar's cultural affairs bureau, told AFP.\n\nXinjiang authorities this week claimed its authorities were carrying out 'normal' tasks after shocking footage purported to show hundreds of shackled and blindfolded Muslim prisoners being transferred. Above, a mosque is seen in Urumqi\n\nUN experts and activists say at least one million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims are held in the detention centres in Xinjiang. China describes them as 'training centres' helping to stamp out extremism and give people new skills.

Above, a photo taken on September 13, 2019 shows the works of a park in a place where before there was a Uighur cemetery in Kuche in the region of Xinjiang\n\nMuslims make up about two per cent of the 1.4 billion population in China. However, as the country is so populous, its Muslim population is expected to be the 19th largest in the world in 2030.

Chinese officials have largely avoided comment on the re-education camps, but some said that ideological changes are needed to fight separatism\n\nUighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang have been told to vow loyalty to the Communist Party of China and President Xi. Pictured, a woman walks past a screen showing images of Chinese President Xi Jinping in Kashgar on June 4, 2019\n\nAuthorities in China's Xinjiang region have rounded up an estimated one million mostly Muslim Turkic-speaking minorities into internment camps in what they call an 'anti-terror' campaign\n\nOn a trip to Xinjiang in September, AFP visited 13 destroyed cemeteries across four cities and saw bones in at least three Shayar sites.\n\nLocal officials dismissed the evidence - one even picked up a bone, held it next to his right shin, and declared it 'too big to be a human's'.\n\nBut seven forensic anthropologists who saw images taken by AFP identified a number of human remains, including a femur, feet, hand bones, and part of an elbow.\n\n'There are a range of ages,' said Xanthe Mallett, a criminologist at the University of Newcastle.\n\nIn Hotan, southern Xinjiang, residents were given just two days to claim their dead, according to a government notice photographed by AFP in May.\n\n'Any tombstone that was not claimed during the registration period will be relocated as an unclaimed corpse,' it read in Uighur.\n\n'The owner of the tombstone is solely responsible for any consequences coming out of the failure in registration.'\n\nOmir Bekali, who claims to have been detained in one of the Muslim re-education camps, cries as he details the psychological stress endured in the internment camp.
