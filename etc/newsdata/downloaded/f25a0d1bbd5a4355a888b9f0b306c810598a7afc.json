On Tuesday night the 27-year-old right-back will play against them for the first time in her England career.\n\nThe daughter of a Portuguese father and an English mother, Bronze was frustrated by the lack of opportunity to break into the senior ranks under then England manager Hope Powell - now in charge of FA Women's Super League outfit Brighton & Hove Albion.\n\nThe Lyon defender admits she was tempted by Portugal's advances when their head coach Monica Jorge first came calling via Facebook at the age of 16, but insists there was no pressure from either side of her family.\n\nLioness Lucy Bronze has revealed she was just four months away from playing for Portugal\n\n'I turned around and said to my mum, \"If I don't make the England team before my 22nd birthday then I'm off to play for Portugal\",' explained Bronze, who helped England win the U19 European Championships in 2009.\n\n'I was doing everything I could and I was playing well on the pitch... I thought I deserved a call up but it took a long, long time.\n\n'England was always the dream but I knew I could go and play for Portugal and I would have loved it just as much.'\n\nPowell was cutting it fine. Just four months shy of her 22nd birthday, Bronze - the winner of the 2019 UEFA Women's Player of the Year award - was eventually handed her senior England debut in a pre-Euro 2013 friendly against Japan at the Pirelli Stadium.\n\nSeveral generations of Bronze's Portuguese family will watch on from the stands at the Bonfirm Stadium near Lisbon as Phil Neville's side look to end their five-game winless streak after losing to Brazil on Saturday.\n\n'In my time with England we've played them once but I didn't get to play, and we've never played in Portugal,' said Berwick-upon-Tweed-born Bronze.\n\n'My Portuguese family have never watched me in an England shirt either so obviously I'm excited for that.'", "description": "Lioness Lucy Bronze has revealed she was just four months away from cashing in on dual nationality status to play for Portugal.
