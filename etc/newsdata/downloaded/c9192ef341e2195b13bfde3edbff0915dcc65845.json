I have a Pinterest board for the wedding and within that I have all the different sections for everything you could think of.\"\n\nMany couples - 42% - said they felt under pressure to have a social media-ready wedding, according to the survey, and a quarter said they were willing to go over budget in order to achieve an \"Instaworthy\" day.\n\nHannah announced her engagement with a photo of her showing her ring and pictures like these are a popular trend online for couples who want to let followers and friends know their big news. A photoshoot alone can cost around an average of \u00a3200.\n\nThe desire for an \"Instagrammable\" day has sparked a boom in businesses dedicated to providing couples with an Instagram-ready service.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nSandi Chahal runs a party and accessories company, which specialises in confetti.\n\n\"Everyone I speak to says they want their wedding to be Instagrammable,\" she said. \"I think it's down to the pressure of social media which wasn't around 20 years ago.\n\n\"Our customer base wants confetti that will photograph well and tassel garlands. They send images that they have found on Pinterest to show us exactly what they want.\n\n\"That's when we noticed a trend in a desire for vivid shades and extravagant decor for weddings.\"\n\nBut Sandi says it is more than simply the desire for a good photo which encourages young couples to splash out on their big day.\n\n\"I think there's more of a willingness to have your personality shine through in your event,\" she said. \"Social media promotes the idea that your wedding can be a fun event which needn't be taken too seriously.\"\n\nImage copyright James Gourley Photography Image caption Lauren (right) was married three years ago\n\nLauren Reynolds, 29, from Hertfordshire, was a self-confessed Pinterest bride when planning her wedding in 2016.\n\n\"I had Pinterest boards for everything,\" she said. \"I looked at bridesmaids and brides' poses for photographs as well.\"\n\nImage copyright James Gourley Photography Image caption Lauren was inspired by social media but combated the cost by doing DIY\n\n\"I tried to make most things myself,\" she said. \"I used a lot of local sites to find items for a photo booth area we made outside on the lawn which worked really well.\n\n\"I found our venue on quite a few Pinterest pages, so I could imitate them exactly. Such as where to put flowers and how they framed the room.\"\n\nPhotographer Georgia Rachel, 24, from Norfolk, believes modern weddings encourage couples to have more fun, though she agrees they are mindful of how the public will perceive their photos.\n\n\"I capture more than just the bride and groom standing stiffly and gazing into the distance,\" she said. \"That style is quite outdated nowadays - couples want to be seen having fun in their photos.\"\n\nThe style of photography at weddings has changed undoubtedly over the years, but what divides today's couples from previous generations is the public nature of their weddings.\n\nAlthough a small number of guests receive invitations, a growing number of wedding photos are now shared on social media, making modern newlyweds more conscious of how their day will translate to their followers.\n\nImage copyright Georgia Rachel Image caption Photographer Georgia Rachel told the BBC that smoke bombs are trending on social media\n\n\"Couples want photos that will trend, or at least get the likes they want,\" she said. \"The expense that comes with Instagram trends is what hurts a lot of couples. It's expensive to jump on bandwagons and trends when it comes to styling.\n\n\"In my experience, Instagram is causing couples to spend far more on their weddings than they ever would have done before social media. But weddings where the couple aren't swayed by Instagram often end up being the most fun.\"\n\nImage copyright Rhys Shea Image caption Joanna and her fiance\n\nDespite the pressure from social media, not all brides and grooms are concerned about how many likes their big day will attract.\n\n\"I have been thinking about photos throughout the planning,\" said bride-to-be Joanna May, from London. \"Although I think that's how you picture parts of the big day anyway.\n\n\"We've been keen to stay away from 'fads' such as smoke bombs. Even though it can look cool, I think they might not date well and I want our photos to feel elegant and timeless.\n\nImage copyright Joanna May Image caption Joanna also announced her engagement on Instagram\n\n\"Overall I'd say social media has definitely helped with getting ideas and communicating them to others, but I wouldn't say I've thought much, if at all, about how the wedding will look online.\n\n\"As long as we have beautiful photos, we'll be happy.\"", "description": "Is the influence from social media apps like Instagram putting too much pressure on the big day?", "authors": ["Jessica Sherwood", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5623/production/_108615022_hannahmuller.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
