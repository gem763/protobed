They begin their lives as nurse bees, caring for and cleaning up after the queen and feeding the larvae, before moving on to the role of caring for the entire colony\n\nMoshe Nagari, a postdoctoral fellow at Hebrew University and lead author, added: 'The fact that the nursing bees sleep so little, even when caring for pupae that do not need to be fed, was the most surprising.\n\n'Before this study, we assumed that the main functions of activity around the clock without circadian rhythms in nurse bees is to provide improved feeding to the developing larvae, enabling them to grow rapidly.'\n\nThe researchers say other animals - such as birds and fish - have shown the ability to give up sleep in certain circumstances.\n\nFor example, birds sleep less during their seasonal migrations while some cavefish have evolved to sleep less compared with their counterparts that live in open water habitats.\n\nAlso, some male birds and fruit flies will sacrifice their sleep to give themselves more time to mate.\n\nPrevious research has shown that worker bees adjust their sleep patterns depending on their role in the colony, with foragers showing strong sleep and wake cycles and nurse bees working around the clock to tend the brood\n\nThe team add that their findings open the door to further research on whether sleep deprivation affects health or cognitive performance.\n\nGuy Bloch, a professor at Hebrew University and study co-author, said: 'Our findings show that sleep is more plastic and less rigid than is commonly accepted.\n\n'With bees, if there is no cost for sleep loss, it means that the brood-tending bees have a mechanism that allows them to significantly reduce sleep without a cost to their brain or other tissue.\n\n'This, of courses, raises the question about what exactly are these mechanisms and what is the basic function of sleep.'", "description": "Research from Hebrew University, Israel, suggests that the females enjoy less shuteye than their fellow male drone bees and queen bees because of their role tending to the larvae.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline", "Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/14/19252984-0-image-a-17_1570109347651.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
