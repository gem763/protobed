And why are we still talking about him 16 years after his death?\n\nTOM HANKS FANBOYS OVER JENNIFER LOPEZ AND MEETING THE 'HUSTLERS' CAST\n\n\n\n\u201cA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,\u201d the forthcoming movie starring Tom Hanks as the late Fred Rogers, gives hints. It also highlights the seven virtues that endeared the Pennsylvanian to generations and which can still help all of us enjoy happier, healthier and more fulfilled lives.\n\nLike so many middle-aged adults today, I grew up watching \u201cMister Rogers Neighborhood.\u201d I loved it. Sitting on our plastic slip-covered floral print couch, I probably couldn\u2019t have told you why. It\u2019s likely I would have said it had something to do with the large traffic light and fish tank in his kitchen.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nBut after attending a screening this past week of the new film with my oldest son, I think I now know what drew so many for so long to the iconic star.\n\nLike the themes on the show, these virtues are simple but profound:\n\n1. His gentleness. From the pace of speech, tone of voice and choice of words, not to mention the warmth of a smile, tilt of the head and the wisdom with which he tackled tough subjects from death to divorce, Fred Rogers had a way of putting the viewer at ease.\n\nSettling in to watch the show reminded me of stepping into our small Central Avenue kitchen. No matter what was happening outside those walls, my parents helped us feel safe. Likewise, Fred Rogers had a knack putting the nation\u2019s kids at ease.\n\n2. His grit. Bullied by classmates who called him \u201cFat Freddy,\u201d an overweight Rogers was forced to confront cruelty at an early age. Shy and introverted, he struggled to make connections. He never gave up. Forging ahead and finding a few good friends, Rogers was elected president of the student council. He identified his gifts and committed cultivating them, eventually graduating from college with a degree in music composition.\n\n3. His gumption. Devoted to pursuing a life of ministry, Rogers postponed seminary in order to work in television, which was in its infancy at the time. \"I went into television because I hated it so,\u201d he once reflected. \u201cAnd I thought there's some way of using this fabulous instrument to nurture those who would watch and listen.\n\n4. His guts. At a time when the culture was going one way, Rogers was unwavering, sticking to his calling. When comedians or critics mocked him, he smiled and kept going. He was comfortable in his own skin \u2014 and sweaters, which his mother made for him each year.\n\nAlthough an ordained minister, Rogers rarely if ever mentioned God or Jesus on his show. Instead, he let his actions preach the Gospel. He didn\u2019t isolate his faith to one day or one building but made sure it was part of everything he did.\n\n5. His graciousness. Viewers might be surprised to learn that \u201cNeighborhood\u201d isn\u2019t so much a film about Fred Rogers\u2019 life as it is a journey about the way his life touched others, specifically Esquire magazine writer Lloyd Vogel, a central character in the film played by Matthew Rays. Rogers overwhelmed the writer with his generosity of spirit, helping him make peace with the past by treating him more graciously then the grouchy writer deserved.\n\n6. His gratitude. Cicero wrote that \u201cGratitude is not only the greatest of all virtues, but the parent of all the others.\u201d During Fred\u2019s daily swims he would pray for others by name. At the conclusion of the workout he would simply say, \u201cThank you, God.\u201d\n\n7. His love and faith in God. Although an ordained minister, Rogers rarely if ever mentioned God or Jesus on his show. Instead, he let his actions preach the Gospel. He didn\u2019t isolate his faith to one day or one building but made sure it was part of everything he did. He liked to quote the line often attributed to Saint Francis of Assisi: \u201cPreach the gospel at all times; if necessary, use words.\u201d\n\nBy the time the movie was over, I felt like I was five again and wished my parents were alive so that I could give them a call or hug. Instead, I headed home and sat on the edge of our boys\u2019 beds and thought of all the nights when my folks did the same for me, especially when fear grabbed hold.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Mister Rogers\" lasted for so long and still means so much to so many because he provided his young viewers what their hearts long for and still do \u2013 love, unconditional acceptance, respect, kindness, forgiveness and an unjaded wonder-filled approach in a world seemingly gone wild.\n\nFred Rogers was medicine for the mind then and a prescription we desperately need now \u2014 and not a moment too soon.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM PAUL BATURA", "description": "Fred Rogers perspective on life is the prescription we still desperately need.", "authors": ["Paul Batura", "Paul J.
