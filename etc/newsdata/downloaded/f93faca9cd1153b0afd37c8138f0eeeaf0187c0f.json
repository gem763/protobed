And at the age of five, he was moved from a refugee camp to Imbabazi Orphanage in northwestern Rwanda.\n\nFounded by American author and humanitarian, Rosamond Carr, Imbabazi means \"a place where you will receive all the love and care a mother would give\" and was home to more than 400 children.\n\n3 former Rwandan orphans who were taught photography as kids, now are passing on that skill to vulnerable children around the world.\n\nIt was at the orphanage Uwitonze, now 28, made two of his closest friends -- Gadi Habumugisha and Jean Bizimana.\n\nLike these three, many of the families of the children were killed during the genocide, while others died of diseases when they fled to Congo as refugees.\n\n\"I was a little child and then there was Red Cross that came and said the little kids have to go to the orphanage in Rwanda ... So, I was picked to go to this orphanage,\" Uwitonze told CNN.\n\nFinding photography\n\nIn 2000, an American photographer and producer, David Jiranek visited Imbabazi.\n\nJiranek was passionate about working with disadvantaged children and started a nonprofit project called Through The Eyes of Children.\n\nThrough the project, Jiranek taught photography to 19 children from the orphanage. They included Uwitonze and his friends.\n\nArmed with disposable cameras, the children learned skills that allowed them to photograph the aftermath of the genocide that killed an estimated 800,000 Rwandans.\n\n\"Grandmother working\" by Gadi. Age 20, 2011. Through The Eyes of Children /Gadi\n\n\"Everyone wanted to learn photography. So, every kid wanted to participate. The founder of the orphanage chose the most interested ones and the ones who did well in school. So that's how we were selected,\" Gadi Habumugisha told CNN.\n\nHabumugisha, now 27, says learning photography exposed him to people and things outside the walls of Imbabazi.\n\n\"Learning photography as a kid added so much to my life because I was living in an orphanage. I would say a closed fence where we didn't interact much with the community around us.\n\n\"But, after we're handed cameras, we went outside into our communities and met with people, made friends and learn so much from them. So, I learned so much from this privilege of having a camera as a young kid,\" he said.\n\nBecoming the 'Camera Kids'\n\nDavid Jiranek who started the photography project died in 2003, but these camera kids who are now professional photographers are keeping it alive.\n\nTaking on the leadership of Through the Eyes of Children, they started a project called Camera Kids , teaching vulnerable children how to use a camera.\n\n\"Man with bike and birds\" by Dusingizimana.

Through The Eyes of Children / Dusingizimana\n\nThe three men teach the basics of lighting, composition and other photography techniques. \"The purpose of (the project) is to share what we have learned when we were kids to the other kids. It's like giving the kids hope or sharing our experience with them.\n\n\"The kids that are in vulnerable situations. So we think with our experience, if we share them with others, it can help them too,\" Jean Bizimana told CNN.\n\nBizimana, 28, says they have organized photography workshops for up to 50 immigrant and foster children across several different countries including Rwanda, the US, and Haiti\n\nGiving hope to the vulnerable\n\nThe photographs made by some of their workshop participants have been exhibited at the US Embassy in Rwanda and the United Nations headquarters in New York.\n\n\"Women from Mutura\" by Gadi. Age 14, 2005. Through The Eyes of Children / Gadi\n\nThe Camera Kids website has curated old and new photographs from children, some of them taken with 35mm disposable cameras as far back as 2001.\n\nUwitonze says the team hopes to give people a voice by teaching them to take powerful pictures.", "description": "Three former Rwandan orphans who were taught photography as kids are now passing on that skill to vulnerable children around the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191005151541-african-voices-changemakers-rwanda-photography-genocide-00000000-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
