The team went deep, he continued, digging into what makes Twitch Twitch. The idea was to future-proof the brand and to better represent its creator community. \u201cI think the important feature is that we\u2019re not tearing everything down,\u201d says Phillipson. \u201cTwitch is a brand that is loved by a lot of people, and we want to be very considerate to our community.\u201d (He did add that the number of people with the Twitch glitch tattoo made the team give the refresh some extra consideration.)\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re already one of us\u201d\n\nThe nuts and bolts: there is a new purple; there is a new font called Roobert, which is based on the Moog synthesizer typeface; there are around 20 new colors; and there is a new glitch. The net effect is that Twitch\u2019s logo looks sleeker and more modern. It\u2019s less blocky and way less 2011 than its predecessor. The new font is also accessible, says Tricia Choi, director of design systems, and there are plans to implement a high contrast feature; to that end, the company is hiring a program manager for accessibility and inclusive design, which points to its ambitions in that arena.\n\nThe change comes with a new slogan \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re already one of us\u201d \u2014 which is meant to both welcome new creators to the platform who aren\u2019t necessarily the company\u2019s core audience of gamers and to showcase the variety of content that is already on the platform.\n\nThe new look will be paired with a large ad campaign featuring some of the platform\u2019s biggest names to introduce it to the world. Phillipson says the company plans to bring \u201cnew folks to Twitch through the vehicle of our creators.\u201d That seems to be at the heart of the redesign. It feels like the new look is meant to draw people in while keeping the focus squarely on the platform\u2019s community.\n\nDuring the research process, the company tried to identify a framework to guide the redesign. \u201cThe monster that we set out to fight in our mission was the fear of irrelevance,\u201d says Phillipson. \u201cEverything we do needs to be in service of making sure that the folks that are on our platform \u2014 our community \u2014 really feel like they matter.\u201d", "description": "Twitch is getting a new look ahead of this year\u2019s TwitchCon in North America, bringing a new logo, new purple color, and new font to the streaming site\u2019s branding.", "authors": ["Bijan Stephen", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-UdS1ilgtRcBYwn6ufAG4TCmItQ=/0x172:2400x1429/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19234617/01_Twitch_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
