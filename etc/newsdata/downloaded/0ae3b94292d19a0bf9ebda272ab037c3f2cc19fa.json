How to watch NASA\u2019s first all-female spacewalk", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE NASA will try to conduct an all-female spacewalk months after the first attempt had to be canceled because of a lack of available spacesuits. USA TODAY\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2014 Men have floated out the hatch on all 420 spacewalks conducted over the past half-century.\n\nThat changes Friday with spacewalk No. 421.\n\nNASA astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir will venture outside the orbiting outpost at about 7:50 a.m. ET Friday and spend over five hours replacing a broken battery battery charger, or BCDU. NASA will livestream the spacewalk starting at 6:30 a.m. ET.\n\nThe units have previously been replaced using a robotic arm, but the newly failed unit is too far away for it to reach.\n\nThe units regulate how much energy flows from the station's massive solar panels to battery units, which are used to provide power during nighttime passes around Earth. Three previous spacewalks had been planned to replace lithium-ion batteries, but those will be rescheduled until the latest BCDU issue is resolved.\n\nCaught on camera: NASA's TESS captured a black hole is shredding a star\n\n3-2-1: NASA's first female launch director to lead countdowns during Artemis missions to the moon\n\nThe hardware failure does present some concern, especially since another BCDU was replaced in April and there are only four more backups on station. In total, there are 24 operational BCDUs.\n\nThe battery charger failed after Koch and a male crewmate installed new batteries outside the space station last week. NASA put the remaining battery replacements on hold to fix the problem and moved up the women's planned spacewalk by three days.\n\nAll four men aboard the International Space Station will remain inside.\n\nFriday's spacewalk will be Koch's fourth and Meir's first.\n\nKoch and Meir will have some time leftover during their extravehicular activity, or EVA, to finish additional tasks like hardware installations for the European Space Agency.\n\nThe planned EVA comes almost seven months since the first all-female spacewalk was canceled due to a lack of properly sized spacesuits for astronauts Koch and Anne McClain. Astronaut Nick Hague ended up joining Koch instead.\n\nBut this time, the right spacesuit hardware is in place.\n\nNASA, meanwhile, is asking schoolteachers to share photos of their students celebrating \"HERstory in the making.\" The pictures might end up on the spacewalk broadcast.\n\nPunchlines: Sewage beer, laptop ban and trips to Mars?

The U.S. trailed by a few months in each instance.\n\nAs of Thursday, men dominated the spacewalking field, 213 to 14.\n\nMeir, a marine biologist who arrived at the orbiting lab last month, will be the 15th female spacewalker. Koch, an electrical engineer, is seven months into an 11-month spaceflight that will be the longest by a woman.\n\nContributing: Emre Kelly, Florida Today; Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/18/nasa-astronauts-international-space-station-first-all-female-spacewalk/4020056002/", "description": "This will be NASA astronauts Christina Koch's fourth spacewalk and Jessica Meir's first.
