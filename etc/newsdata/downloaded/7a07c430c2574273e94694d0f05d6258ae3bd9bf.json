Not that I agree with everything in Churchill\u2019s assertion, because socialism does not divide misery equally. The ruling class administering socialism always make out like the denizens of Panem in the world of The Hunger Games.\n\nBut given the obsession with \u201cincome inequality,\u201d Churchill\u2019s statement that, \u201cThe inherent vice of capitalism is the uneven division of blessings,\u201d seems quite astute. Whatever was going on is Churchill\u2019s time, the record of socialist misery has only grown larger. Meanwhile, the standard of living has continued to grow under (relatively) free markets and global capitalism.\n\nAs Deidre McCloskey has pointed out, this claim is undeniable. \u201cThe Great Fact\u201d is that we have experienced a miracle in human history since 1800 so that virtually everyone enjoys a higher standard of living and lives a healthier longer life while the population has, at the same time, experienced exponential growth. As Walker Wright writes:\n\nPoverty has been a moral issue at the center of philosophical, theological, and social thought for millennia. However, over the last two centuries, much of the world has experienced what Nobel economist Angus Deaton calls \u201cthe great escape\u201d from economic deprivation. As a 2013 issue of The Economist explained, one of the main targets of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG) was to halve extreme poverty between 1990 and 2015. That goal was accomplished years ahead of schedule and the credit largely lies with one thing: \"\u201cThe MDGs may have helped marginally, by creating a yardstick for measuring progress, and by focusing minds on the evil of poverty. Most of the credit, however, must go to capitalism and free trade, for they enable economies to grow\u2014and it was growth, principally, that has eased destitution.\u201d\"\n\nNo force on earth, other than free markets and bourgeois culture, has brought so much to so many. And the confirming testimony to this Great Fact is that critics of capitalism and the free market are reduced to complaining about income inequality. Because these formerly unimaginable material blessings are \u201cunevenly\u201d divided among people, the fact that they are better fed, healthier, and live longer, doesn\u2019t matter because billionaires exist.\n\nWith apologies to H. L. Mencken, the real definition of socialism seems to be, \u201cThe haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be rich.\u201d The calculus almost seems explicitly that we\u2019d be better off with more poverty if it meant we could reduce the wealth of the super wealthy.\n\nBut if the majority of people are better off than they were before, how does the existence of the super rich detract from that? I remember being told that capitalism was motivated by coveting one\u2019s neighbor -- \u201dkeeping up with the Joneses\u201d it was called dismissively. But such motivations seem rather mild compared to the hatred expressed toward the affluent.\n\nKing Solomon warned long ago that, \u201cA tranquil heart gives life to the flesh, but envy makes the bones rot\u201d (Proverbs 14:30; ESV). Indeed, Solomon advocated a certain kind of concern for collecting wealth but warned against another kind. For an example of the kind of attitude he encouraged, consider Proverbs 21:17: \u201dWhoever loves pleasure will be a poor man; he who loves wine and oil will not be rich\u201d (ESV). But Solomon contrasted such long-term saving (or in socialist-speak: \u201choarding\u201d) with get-rich-quick schemes: \"A faithful man will abound with blessings, but whoever hastens to be rich will not go unpunished\" (Proverbs 28:20; ESV).\n\nIt is stupid for us to make ourselves miserable worrying about billionaires at a time when we are better off than all our ancestors. Therefore, it is much more delusional to use those billionaires as an excuse for ending an economic system that has reduced poverty for everyone and replacing it with a totalitarian system that spreads misery.", "description": "Senator John Cornyn recently tweeted a quotation ascribed to Winston .10/28/2019 20:14:55PM EST.", "authors": ["Mark Horne", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/177/ca0f325d-d67a-454c-8466-534e45ddad82.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
