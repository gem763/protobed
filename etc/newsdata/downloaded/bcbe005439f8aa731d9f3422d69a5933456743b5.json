(Michel Hellman and Pascal Girard/Mile End Portraits)\n\nMile End Memories was founded in 2003 by a group of residents who were interested in the history, architecture and heritage of the area.\n\nThe organization offers walking tours from May to September.\n\nBur said change has been a constant in the area and it isn't necessarily a bad thing \u2014 although he does regret so many shuttered storefronts on neighbourhood arteries like St-Viateur Street.\n\n\"Despite things going wrong, there's still a strong community spirit,\" he said.\n\n\"Community groups have always gotten people together to fight against things that are wrong. I think that spirit will continue,\" Bur said.\n\nThe area is marked by 'a strong community spirit' said Justin Bur, a board member at Mile End Memories.
