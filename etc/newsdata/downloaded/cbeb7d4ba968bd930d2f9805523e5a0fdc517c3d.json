Pls set up.\u201d\n\n\u201cMayor wants an hour w him and wants Herminia to stop by to say hi at the front of [sic] back end,\u201d wrote his campaign finance director, Elana Leopold, in reference to then Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Dr. Hermania Palacio.\n\nHowever, mayoral spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein claimed de Blasio did nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cCity Hall and the campaign followed all rules and regulations. There is nothing prohibiting the teams from coordinating on scheduling,\u201d she said.\n\nIn July, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) sent a letter to the mayor\u2019s failed presidential campaign regarding its fundraising methods.\n\nPolitico reported:\n\nIn a July public filing, the de Blasio camp noted a $52,852 debt owed to the NY Fairness PAC, a state political action committee controlled by the mayor. The campaign had argued that this was a permissible loan from one organization to another. But the FEC\u2019s senior campaign finance analyst, Robin Kelly, wrote this week that the practice is not allowed by campaign finance rules.\n\nOn September 21, Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) said during an interview on Breitbart News Saturday that de Blasio\u2019s bid for the presidency was \u201ca disaster from the outset.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a joke from the get-go and New York City suffered as a result of it at home. There was an absence of leadership while he was in New York City, it was obviously only getting worse when he was spending so much time away,\u201d Zeldin concluded.", "description": "City hall staffers regularly coordinated with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's 2017 re-election campaign, according to emails.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/de-Blasio-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
