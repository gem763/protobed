Of course I did\u2014the novel as irresistible trap, impossible not to devour in a sitting, is his m\u00e9tier. Perrotta is more entertainer than artiste, but some writers are adept at sentences and some at character and Perrotta\u2019s genius happens to be story. It\u2019s no wonder he\u2019s had such a successful run in Hollywood: Election and Little Children on the big screen (the latter got him an Oscar nomination), and, for HBO, first The Leftovers and now Mrs. Fletcher.\n\nThe series adaptation of Perrotta\u2019s 2017 book stretches over seven episodes; the network will release one weekly, clearly hoping to build a hit rather than inundate us with yet another binge. Though I\u2019m ethically bound to honor HBO\u2019s embargo of plot details, it would anyway be morally wrong to spoil the story that Perrotta (who wrote the first and last episodes himself) has constructed.\n\nHere\u2019s a thumbnail: Eve Fletcher (Kathryn Hahn) is a divorcee. In the first episode, directed by Nicole Holofcener, she\u2019s helping Brendan (Jackson White), her only child, pack for college. Really, she\u2019s doing the packing; Brendan is having one last hurrah with his high school cohort. We get a glimpse of Fletcher at work\u2014she\u2019s the director of a community senior center\u2014and tangling with her ex-husband, Ted (Josh Hamilton). But mostly we see her slipping slowly toward the inexorable crisis of being an empty-nester. She\u2019s lonely. She\u2019s bored. She feels adrift, unaccustomed to having only her own needs to tend to. Sex isn\u2019t the answer for her, but pornography does scratch some itch. It doesn\u2019t seem altogether that dirty; indeed, it\u2019s almost sweet, as though watching strangers have sex is showing Eve how to be fully human.\n\nThe first episode is a gift from Perrotta to Hahn. Not a lot happens, and Hahn makes hay of this. She goes from firm and professional after an embarrassing incident in the office to indulgent and exasperated in the scenes with her son. Hahn seems to be relishing every minute. And it\u2019s so fun to watch her salvage the more clich\u00e9d business\u2014the physical comedy of a petite woman loading a minivan, or the trite sight of a mom wielding a wine glass.", "description": "Kathryn Hahn plays a different kind of empty-nester in HBO's newest offering.", "authors": ["Rumaan Alam"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/61183ca9b916ee00cf9a711cb768914d87b897b2.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
