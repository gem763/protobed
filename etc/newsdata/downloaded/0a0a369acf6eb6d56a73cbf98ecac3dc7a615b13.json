(Cue Beyonce\u2019s \u201cSingle Ladies\u201d \u2014 and parents sighing in relief as they use this as another excuse to beg their kids to abstain from dating \u201cuntil they\u2019re older.\u201d)\n\nDating is considered a normal and often essential part of teen development, as more than a third of adolescents ages 13 to 17 have had some type of romantic experience, and that jumps to 44% between the ages of 15 and 17, according to Pew Research. And dating is indeed one important way of developing social skills and growing emotionally.\n\nBut that also means some two-thirds of teens actually don\u2019t date. And Brooke Douglas, a doctoral student in health promotion at the University of Georgia\u2019s College of Public Health, wondered about those lonely hearts.\n\n\u201cDoes this mean that teens that don\u2019t date are maladjusted in some way? That they are social misfits?\u201d she said in an interview with the University of Georgia\u2019s online newspaper. \u201cFew studies had examined the characteristics of youth who do not date during the teenage years, and we decided we wanted to learn more.\u201d\n\nSo she analyzed data collected by study co-author Pamela Orpinas that followed a group of adolescents in northeast Georgia from sixth through 12th grade. Each spring, the students self-reported whether or not they had dated, as well as a social and emotional factors such as their relationships with friends, their relationships at home and at school, and whether they were showing any symptoms of depression or having suicidal thoughts. Their teachers were also surveyed about each student\u2019s behavior in areas including social skills, leadership skills and levels of depression.\n\nAnd the results showed that non-dating students had similar \u2014 or even better \u2014 interpersonal skills than their classmates who were in romantic relationships.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, their teachers rated these single students \u201csignificantly higher\u201d for social and leadership skills than their coupled classmates. And both the students themselves and the teachers reported that the non-dating teens were happier and less depressed. The number of students who self-reported feeling sad or hopeless was also \u201csignificantly lower\u201d in the non-dating group.\n\n\u201cIn summary, we found that non-dating students are doing well and are simply following a different and healthy developmental trajectory than their dating peers,\u201d Orpinas told the UGA news site.\n\nDouglas added that, \u201cWhile the study refutes the notion of non-daters as social misfits, it also calls for health promotion interventions at schools and elsewhere to include non-dating as an option for normal, healthy development.\u201d\n\nIndeed, government data shows that teens are dating less now than they did in the past, with the number of 12th grade students who remain single jumping from 14% in 1991 to 38% in 2013. And the number of teens who had ever had sex has been on the decline, dropping from 54% in 1992 to 40% in 2017.\n\nThe authors didn\u2019t offer explanations on why these kids were happier on their own. But research in adults shows that some alone-time can improve quality of life. A 2016 presentation for the American Psychological Association put forth evidence that single people have a heightened sense of self-determination, and they are more likely to experience \u201ca sense of continued growth and development as a person\u201d compared to those who stayed married, for example. There\u2019s also research showing that many single people are more physically active and have lower BMIs than people who are married. Plus, looking for love isn\u2019t cheap: The average American spends $1,596 a year on dating, including the grooming and bar tabs that goes into going out. So being alone can be easier on the budget.\n\nRelated: All that money you spend on bad dates every year could pay one month\u2019s rent\n\nThere\u2019s also plenty of benefits to being in a healthy romantic relationship, of course. The bottom-line is that either lifestyle choice is normal.\n\n\u201cAs public health professionals, we can do a better job of affirming that adolescents do have the individual freedom to choose whether they want to date or not, and that either option is acceptable and healthy,\u201d said Douglas.", "description": "A new study suggests that teens who stay single are happier than those who couple up.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR094_teenda_ZG_20190911112632.jpg"}
