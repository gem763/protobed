Operation", "language": "en", "text": "Thierry Schmidt, President of Verd\u00e9lite Sciences, Inc. and Chief Commercial Officer of Emerald Health Therapeutics (TSXV: EMH) (OTCQX: EMHTF), spoke with Benzinga regarding Verd\u00e9lite\u2019s prospects as a now fully-licensed, vertically-integrated cannabis production and processing facility.\n\nAbout Emerald Health Therapeutics and Verd\u00e9lite Sciences, Inc.\n\nEmerald Health Therapeutics is a licensed Canadian-based producer of cannabis products for medical and adult-use customers.\n\nThe company specializes in using proprietary technologies and methodologies for large-scale cultivation and product manufacturing. Emerald\u2019s Qu\u00e9bec-based Verd\u00e9lite is a wholly-owned subsidiary with an indoor grow and processing facility focused on the production of premium, craft cannabis strains.\n\nAbout Thierry Schmidt\n\nSchmidt served in leadership roles at large organizations such as Avon, British American Tobacco, L'Or\u00e9al, Eagle Energy, and Botanical Technologies.\n\nHis presence ensures that Verd\u00e9lite\u2019s operations and Qu\u00e9bec expansion are aligned with Emerald\u2019s long-term vision to commercialize craft cannabis.\n\nBackground\n\nEmerald\u2019s fully-licensed Verd\u00e9lite cultivation and processing operation solves common industry production challenges via a vertically-integrated 88,000 square foot facility.\n\nThe subsidiary\u2019s operations are focused on the commercialization of higher-margin, premium craft cannabis products through scientifically controlled methods: \u201cWe have a total of 21 grow rooms, 16 processing rooms, and dedicated storage vaults,\u201d said Schmidt.\n\n\u201cThe facility is divided into small rooms, allowing us to increase operating efficiency throughout the building, from the flow of goods to the flow of people.\u201d\n\nExpansion\n\nVerd\u00e9lite recently received final licensing from Health Canada making it now fully-licensed for cultivation and packaging, which will allow Emerald to scale its recreational sales across Canada and build a dedicated relationship with Qu\u00e9bec customers.\n\n\u201cThis confirmation puts us in a great position to be able to bring our branded products to market early next year,\u201d noted Schmidt.\n\nIn conjunction with facility additions, new licensing will allow Verd\u00e9lite to capture untapped demand from the Qu\u00e9becois community.\n\nIn a release on the matter, Riaz Bandali, CEO at Emerald, said, \u201cThis new license amendment allows Verd\u00e9lite to transition into its full commercial phase and positions Verd\u00e9lite as a key growth contributor to Emerald\u2019s financial results in 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith this extended, controlled indoor growing space and Verd\u00e9lite\u2019s unique cannabis strains, we aim to bring distinct and unique consumer-driven products to the Qu\u00e9bec market.\u201d\n\nFollowing this interview, Verd\u00e9lite made the announcement it had also received its sales license amendment allowing for direct sales of branded products to provincial/territorial wholesalers and authorized private retailers.\n\nPricing\n\nAccording to Schmidt, existing volumes -- from other market participants -- are mostly sourced from large-yield greenhouses whose outflows are expected to place downward pressure on the price per gram.\n\nWhat will assist Emerald in terms of sustaining its competitive advantage and long-term operations is an adherence to differentiation and quality through its Verd\u00e9lite operation -- as well as its organic facility in British Columbia.\n\n\u201cFirst, I think, from a competitive advantage point of view, our infrastructure will help us in getting high-quality premium craft flower into the market,\u201d Schmidt noted.\n\n\u201cSecond, very few other operations have been prioritizing the Qu\u00e9bec market, even when this market represents a fourth of the Canadian population,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to Schmidt, Verd\u00e9lite aims to prioritize consumers across Canada, with particular emphasis on the Qu\u00e9bec region: \u201cWe believe that we can establish a leadership position in Qu\u00e9bec and prioritize our brands based on consumer needs.\u201d\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nVerd\u00e9lite is an arm of Emerald Health Therapeutics; the wholly-owned subsidiary maintains a competitive advantage via economies of scale and a premium product pipeline.\n\n\u201cAt Verd\u00e9lite, it\u2019s the value equation -- delivering a high-quality product -- in a premium, high-profit segment,\u201d said Schmidt.\n\nPlanning near-term penetration into the Qu\u00e9bec market is a testament to Emerald\u2019s ability to execute on its unique positioning in an emerging space.\n\nEmerald Health is a content partner of Benzinga\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
