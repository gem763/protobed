(Supplied)\n\nA goat has been found with a dagger lodged in its back on the popular tourist beach in Camps Bay, the Cape of Good Hope SPCA said on Wednesday.\n\nDespite the deep wound, the animal was expected to make a full recovery, said spokesperson Belinda Abraham.\n\nThe goat, which has been named Hilda, was found early on Sunday morning, the same time as the Spring Equinox.\n\n\"A law enforcement officer was doing standard patrols and found her on the beach in between some rocks, trying to hide there. She had already lost a lot of blood,\" said Abraham.\n\nLodged in the goat's back was a black dagger, with red cloth tied around the wooden handle and what appeared to be hair knotted into the fabric.\n\nREAD: Don't keep exotic pets, urges SPCA following the discovery of an abused monkey\n\nAbraham said it appeared the animal was to be used for a ritual sacrifice.\n\nThe goat was transported to the SPCA hospital, where the dagger was removed.\n\nShe is now recovering in the farmyard.\n\n\"Hilda is doing quite well and there are no issues with her mobility. We are monitoring her for secondary infections, and she seems to be thriving.\"\n\nAbraham said stabbing an animal in this manner and not seeking veterinary assistance were contraventions of the Animal Protection Act.\n\nAnyone with information about the incident can contact the organisation on 021 700 4158/9 or on 083 326 1604 (after hours).\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "A goat found with a dagger lodged in its back on Camps Bay beach may have been the victim of a ritual sacrifice, says the SPCA.
