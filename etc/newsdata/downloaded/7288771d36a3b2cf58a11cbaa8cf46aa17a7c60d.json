The president is now officially using the power of his office to help prop up his struggling golf business. There appears to be no bottom to President Trump\u2019s corruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cHolding the G-7 at a Trump property is one of the most foolish, unseemly things the [White House] could do,\u201d tweeted Ari Fleischer, former press secretary for President George W. Bush. \u201cThe President enjoys waiving red flags in front of bulls, but this fight isn\u2019t worth it.\u201d\n\nWalter Shaub, the former director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, said the selection was \u201can escalation\u201d that crossed an ethical line.\n\n\u201cIt may look from the outside like it\u2019s been corruption all along,\u201d Shaub tweeted, \u201cbut participating in a contract award to yourself is different by orders of magnitude. This is a red line crossed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is corruption, plain and simple,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on Twitter.\n\nDonald Trump speaks at a campaign event with employees at Trump National Doral in Miami in 2016.

Mulvaney dismissed that idea too.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s brand is probably strong enough as it is,\u201d he said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need any more help on that. It\u2019s the most recognizable name in the English language and probably around the world.\u201d\n\nIn May, the Washington Post reported that business at the 643-room Doral Miami resort was in \u201csharp decline,\u201d and that its net operating income had fallen by 69 percent in the first two years of the Trump presidency.\n\nMulvaney said Trump himself came up with the idea to add his Miami golf resort to the list of possible G-7 venues.\n\n\u201cWe sat around one night, we were back in the dining room, going over it with our advance team, and we had the list, and he goes, \u2018What about Doral?\u2019\u201d Mulvaney recalled. \u201cAnd we go, \u2018That\u2019s not the craziest idea.\u2019\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "The White House announcement  that next year\u2019s G-7 summit will be held at the Trump National Doral near Miami was immediately blasted by critics who say President Trump is personally profiting from the choice to hold it there.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ssCm3aC2Ee4IHw1GRoni1g--~B/aD0yODAxO3c9NTAwNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/e8226a40-f109-11e9-9338-69f7ffe204cc", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
