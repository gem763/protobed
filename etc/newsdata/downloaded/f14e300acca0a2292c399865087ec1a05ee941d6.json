(Ben Margot/AP)\n\nNote: This article was originally published Friday morning, several hours before Coach Jon Gruden announced that Antonio Brown would play on Monday night against the Denver Broncos, which in turn came before Brown appeared to ask the Raiders to release him on Saturday morning. The players listed below are viable waiver wire candidates in any circumstance.\n\nThe drama surrounding the Oakland Raiders and wideout Antonio Brown doesn\u2019t appear to be ending anytime soon. That could be bad news for fantasy owners who invested a second-round pick for his services.\n\nLuckily, there are some options to supplement that massive question mark on your roster; namely, Raiders teammate Tyrell Williams who, as of Friday morning, was No. 2 on the team\u2019s depth chart and still available in approximately 30 percent of fantasy leagues.\n\n[From Steelers subtweets to potential suspension: The Antonio Brown saga, explained]\n\nWilliams caught 41 of 47 catchable targets (out of 65 total targets, per Sports Info Solutions) for 653 yards and five touchdowns in 2018 as the No. 3 wideout for the Los Angeles Chargers. In 2016, he was the Chargers\u2019 top wide receiver after Keenan Allen was lost for the year to a knee injury in Week 1, catching 69 of 90 on-target throws (out of 119 targets) for 1,059 yards and seven touchdowns.\n\nThe latter is a good indication of what you could expect if Williams is indeed the Raiders\u2019 top option, especially with so many targets from last year up for grabs. Four of Oakland\u2019s most-targeted receivers from 2018 \u2014 Jared Cook, Jordy Nelson, Seth Roberts and Amari Cooper \u2014 are gone, leaving 284 of the team\u2019s 530 targets (54 percent) unaccounted for. And Williams has outperformed the average NFL receiver in fantasy points per target over his four-year career.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m one of the more underrated receivers,\u201d Williams told NBC Sports in July. \u201cI know I can run every route and obviously I can get better at it, but I know I can run all those routes, I can get open with every route. So, I definitely feel like I\u2019m overlooked in my short game, but I do feel I can be a good short route runner.\u201d\n\nTyrell Williams excelled on a variety of routes in 2016.\n\n\n\n87th percentile success rate vs. man coverage in #ReceptionPerception pic.twitter.com/QB19kXm4KW \u2014 Matt Harmon (@MattHarmon_BYB) July 19, 2017\n\nIf quarterback Derek Carr looks for Williams as much as he did his other No. 1 receivers since entering the NFL in 2014, we could see Williams targeted something like 8.7 times per game, a robust number that would put him among the most-targeted receivers in the NFL.\n\nRookie Hunter Renfrow, a two-time College Football Playoff champion at Clemson (who is available in 90 percent of fantasy leagues), should also receive a boost, since he should be on the field when the Raiders go 11 personnel (one running back, one tight end and three wide receivers). Dubbed a \u201cmagician in the slot\u201d by Pro Football Focus, Renfrow caught 49 of 50 on-target throws as Clemson\u2019s slot receiver and showed good chemistry with Carr during the preseason.\n\nPractices continues as usual for the rest of the #Raiders team.

His production in the NFL has been limited \u2014 he was suspended for the entire 2017 season for violating the league\u2019s substance abuse policy \u2014 but Carr loves throwing to his tight ends (Cook led the team in targets last year with 101) and Waller has the skills to excel if that continues in 2019.\n\n\u201cHe learns fast. He is fast. He\u2019s extremely talented. I think he\u2019s going to be one of the best kept secrets in the league,\u201d Raiders Coach Jon Gruden said of Waller. \u201cI really believe he\u2019s got a future if he keeps working like he is.\u201d\n\nUntil Brown\u2019s future becomes more clear, Waller could be worth a flier.\n\nTwo other players outside the Raiders\u2019 roster are also worth a look.\n\nJamison Crowder, available in more than half of fantasy leagues, led all slot receivers in yards of separation from defenders in 2017 as a member of the Washington Redskins. He played just nine games in 2018 because of various injuries, but he did catch 29 passes for 388 yards and two touchdowns. Now with the Jets, he should see an increased role as the primary slot receiver in Adam Gase\u2019s offense, a position that averaged between 4.6 and 10.1 targets per game since 2013 under Gase\u2019s watch.\n\nA receiver who offers a higher risk/reward scenario is Demaryius Thomas. The former Broncos star, available in over 80 percent of leagues, was released by the New England Patriots and then re-signed with the team. Thomas has an injury concern with his Achilles\u2019 tendon, but he caught seven passes for 87 yards and two touchdowns in the Patriots\u2019 fourth preseason game.\n\nPlus, Thomas could get easy looks running the field with Julian Edelman and Josh Gordon and possibly soak up some of the targets left behind by retired tight end Rob Gronkowski. And lastly, New England will face some softer pass defenses at the end of the regular season, which could come at a time when Tom Brady and Thomas are just finding their rhythm.\n\nRead more fantasy football coverage:\n\nWeek 1 fantasy football rankings\n\nFantasy football start/sit Week 1: Austin Ekeler up, Julio Jones down\n\nFantasy football sleepers and NFL injuries for Week 1", "description": "Oakland's Tyrell Williams should receive a long look from fantasy owners.", "authors": ["Neil Greenberg", "Reporter Analyzing Advanced Sports Statistics For The Washington Post", "September At Am", "Neil Greenberg Is A Staff Writer With The Washington Post Whose Beat Is Sports Analytics.
