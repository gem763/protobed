Franklin\u2019s Desai Sticks to 3% Yield Call That\u2019s Elusive as Ever\n\n(Bloomberg) -- It\u2019s been a tough year for investors predicting higher Treasury yields, with the 10-year rate tumbling 100 basis points and the world\u2019s biggest bond market on track for its best annual performance since 2011.\n\nThe consensus on Wall Street is for 10-year yields to remain below 2% until mid-2021, as expectations for global growth sag and traders brace for a likely third straight Federal Reserve rate cut next week.\n\nBut Sonal Desai, chief investment officer of Franklin Templeton\u2019s fixed-income group, is sticking by her forecast for the yield to surge to 3%, a level not seen since December, and up from about 1.75% at present.\n\nShe now sees that 3% mark in 12 months, rather than her prior call for the end of 2019. She reiterated that year-end view in July, just before the rate started its dive to a three-year low amid escalating trade friction. For Desai, the case for higher yields comes down to ballooning deficits, the prospect of stimulative fiscal and monetary policy, and her view that inflation is set to rise on job-market strength and accelerating wage growth.\n\n\u201cAt the start of this year, I misread how much the Fed would be swayed by the markets, and that makes it much harder to call,\u201d Desai, who oversees $155 billion from San Mateo, California, said in an interview. When asked about her 3% yield forecast, she said: \u201cDo I think 3% is out of bounds for 12 months from now? Absolutely not, I think it could happen based on what I see.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s hardly alone in her bearish target for Treasuries, which looks even more elusive than when she voiced it back in April. A bet against Treasuries by her colleague Michael Hasenstab went wrong in a big way in the third quarter. And back in September, after a ferocious bond rally drove yields in the world\u2019s biggest markets to record lows, some investors were saying that\u2019s as low as they\u2019d go.\n\nFor Desai, the looming 2020 U.S. election plays into her outlook.\n\nBoth major political parties have \u201cembraced very loose fiscal-policy agendas, so regardless of the outcome of next year\u2019s election, I expect fiscal deficits to widen, boosting Treasury supply and outstripping demand,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will cause prices to fall as we move further down this path of incredibly easy fiscal policy, hand in hand with very easy monetary conditions.\u201d\n\nFed Call\n\nWhen the year started, Desai had expected Fed rate increases in 2019. At the time, many were betting the central bank wouldn\u2019t raise rates at all this year, and traders were upping wagers on a 2020 cut. The Fed then lowered rates in July and September amid weak global growth, uncertainty about the trade war and subdued inflation.\n\nIn February, she predicted an even higher yield level, saying the 10-year might reach 3.5% to 4% in the medium term.\n\nShe\u2019s been less pessimistic on the U.S. and global outlook than some prognosticators. She sees global growth moderating and the U.S. poised to expand by 2% to 2.25% this year, with no signs of imminent recession.\n\nBefore assuming her current post in December, the Indian-born Desai worked as a portfolio manager with Hasenstab. She now oversees a different set of funds, including the $4.7 billion Franklin Total Return Fund. Its 2019 return of 8.4% puts it in the middle of its peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nAnother fund, the Franklin Strategic Income Fund, has gained 7.9% this year, besting about 70% of its peers, Bloomberg data show. She says it\u2019s gotten increasingly difficult to find opportunities in credit markets, but that she\u2019s finding some in higher-rated collateralized loan obligations.\n\nYears of easy monetary policy and low rates have forced investors into ever-riskier assets, and financial stability is an issue that\u2019s \u201cfront and center\u201d in her mind, she said.\n\nShe expects the Fed to lower rates next week. But she doesn\u2019t expect an extended easing cycle and says it would be \u201cwise for policy makers to start guiding markets away from anticipating continual cuts at every meeting.\u201d\n\nWith the U.S. jobless rate at a 50-year low, she says she\u2019s \u201cheartened\u201d to see some Fed officials recognize the financial-stability risk that comes from low rates.\n\n\u201cThe Fed essentially exchanged volatility at one point for unknown volatility at another, and has not responded to the underlying economy,\u201d she said. \u201cMarkets have been going along for the ride, and I definitely don\u2019t see yields being permanently lower.\u201d", "description": "Franklin\u2019s Desai Sticks to 3% Yield Call That\u2019s Elusive as Ever", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC180BO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
