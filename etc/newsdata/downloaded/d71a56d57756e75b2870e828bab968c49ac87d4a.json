John wrote about this previously when commuters (and the Mayor of London) were already lambasting the group. But now it\u2019s getting worse. After the Brits began busting up the group\u2019s antics, the Americans got in on the action out on the west coast. (Daily Wire)\n\nOn Saturday, perhaps inspired by London commuters, Americans shut down two Extinction Rebellion protests meant to shame Californians in San Francisco and Long Beach into submitting to the group\u2019s aims. In San Francisco \u2014 a city which is certainly sympathetic to Extinction Rebellion\u2019s aims \u2014 at least the ones that XR typically makes public \u2014 an angry commuter wearing scrubs came upon a line of Extinction Rebellion protesters blocking traffic with a huge sign and quickly took matters into his own hands, ripping down their banner and chucking it away, clearing the path for cars to continue on their way.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at the video of the angry commuter pitching their sign over a fence, particularly the title.

Employees physically picked them up and threw them out of the building as the diners cheered. The police refused to intervene on behalf of the protesters.\n\nClimate change activists raid a burger joint and harass the workers. Neither the employees nor police are having it. People are fed up with Extinction Rebellion. pic.twitter.com/6bIPK4pb9U \u2014 Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) October 18, 2019\n\nThis was something I predicted as soon as they started shutting down the airport in London. These idiots simply don\u2019t understand the most fundamental concept behind the idea of protesting. You\u2019re trying to win people over to see your side of the debate. You do that by getting your message out in a way the general public might be open to. If all you do is \u201cdisrupt\u201d normal society, you\u2019re just going to make everyone angry\u2026 at you. And by association, your cause.\n\nEven if I\u2019m one of the people most sympathetic to your climate cause, by the time I\u2019ve sat in the airport for nine hours after you made me miss my flight, I\u2019m running out to buy a fresh bag of charcoal, firing up my BBQ grill as soon as I get home and lighting off my fossil fuel-powered flamethrower off the back deck for no damn reason at all. And when you shut down the highways and the places where the public expects to engage in commerce, you\u2019re going to get the same reaction. This is a good clue that should be absorbed by the Black Lives Matter movement and every other group of any ideology who thinks they\u2019re going to win the debate by \u201cdisrupting\u201d society.", "description": "Neither making friends nor influencing people", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Extinction-Rebellion.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
