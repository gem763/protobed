It\u2019s VR game, after all! (Image: Marvel)\n\nThere are no strings on him. But there\u2019s gonna be plenty of strings connecting your VR headset and backpack up in order to actually play Avengers: Damage Control.\n\nAfter announcing the new collaboration with ILMxLAB last week, Marvel has revealed a closer look at its upcoming location-based VR experience Avengers: Damage Control. The premise is that players \u2014 via the medium of their oversized backpacks and VR headsets \u2014 will step into one of the multiple Wakandan outreach stations established by T\u2019Challa at the end of Black Panther, trying out new emergency response suits designed by Shuri (Letitia Wright, reprising her role from the movies).\n\nNaturally \u2014 because being Shuri\u2019s guinea pig, while fun, does not an action packed experience make \u2014 things will very quickly go horribly wrong and you\u2019ll have to work together with several of the MCU\u2019s finest superheroes to battle a familiar threat: a returned Ultron!\n\nAs well as Wright, Damage Control will feature vocal performances from Benedict Cumberbatch, Evangeline Lily, and Paul Rudd, all reprising their roles as Doctor Strange, the Wasp and Ant-Man respectively. But aside from revealing Ultron as the experience\u2019s big bad, the above trailer also throws in a few more Marvel heroes, like Spider-Man, the Hulk, Falcon, and T\u2019Challa \u2014 but Marvel has yet to confirm if they are being voiced by their MCU counterparts or by soundalike actors.\n\nStill, it looks like everything you\u2019d actually want out of a Marvel VR experience: working with big movie heroes, a cool foe to beat the hell out of, and a suit that lets you do all sorts of wonderful superhero things, like flying around shooting laser beams out of your hands or projecting energy shields. Big explosive dumb fun!\n\nThose suits being a hybrid of Wakandan Design Group and Stark Industries tech still bother the hell out of me though. Shuri knows better.\n\nTickets to book Avengers: Damage Control at select VOID VR locations in the U.S. are available now, ahead of the VR experience\u2019s kickoff date, October 18.", "description": "There are no strings\u00a0on him.
