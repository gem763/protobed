Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.): How do you pay for \"Medicare for all,\" a proposal that would dramatically reshape the entire U.S. health care system?\n\nWarren, a Democratic candidate for president, says she will soon release a plan to pay for Medicare for all after facing criticism for evading questions about the proposal's potential tax implications for the middle class.\n\nThe tough part: While any plan to pay for Medicare for All would likely require a middle-class tax increase, experts say, the issue of funding is complex and would also need a slew of other revenue options as well.\n\n\"We're talking about a very substantial increase in revenues,\" said Linda Blumberg of the Urban Institute, which recently released a cost estimate for a Medicare for all-style plan. \"With that large of an increase in revenue needed, my guess is a mix of different revenue sources would be looked at.\"\n\nThe politics: Warren has struggled to answer questions about how she would pay for Medicare for all.\n\nThere are disagreements about how much the single-payer system would cost, which make it difficult to figure out how to pay for it.\n\nBut the question that keeps arising during the Democratic presidential debates is whether Medicare for all would require a tax increase for the middle class.\n\nWe break down Warren's tough choices here.\n\nSenate Democrats demand answers on payments for Tom Price's charter flights\n\nSenate Democrats want to know why the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has not recovered any of the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on improper charter flight travel by the agency's former secretary, Tom Price.\n\nIn a letter to the agency on Thursday, Sens.

They needed 178,000 to officially qualify as a ballot measure.\n\nThe move is the latest effort by voters in red states where the governors and legislatures have blocked Medicaid expansion. In 2018, residents of Utah, Nebraska and Idaho voted to extend coverage to low-income adults.\n\nSupporters of expansion in Oklahoma are highlighting the potential billions of dollars in federal funding that they said could be used to help keep rural hospitals open and help 200,000 people gain health coverage.\n\nThere are currently only 17 states that have refused to expand Medicaid to people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Under ObamaCare, the federal government will pay at least 90 percent of the costs.\n\nRead more here.\n\nDistrict of Columbia reports first death from vaping disease\n\nWashington, D.C. on Thursday reported its first death from a vaping-related illness that's been sweeping the country.\n\nAccording to new federal figures released Thursday, there have been at least 35 reported deaths in 24 states and D.C., with over 1,600 illnesses in every state except Alaska.\n\nAs of October 22, 2019, 1,604 confirmed and probable lung injury cases associated with use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products were reported in 49 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) unveiled a plan Thursday to address substance use disorders and end the opioid crisis as part of his 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nThe plan would, among other things, look to end the stigma of substance abuse, focus on promoting long-term recovery, target the supply chain of illegally imported fentanyl and work to improve economic stability for those recovering from substance abuse.\n\n\"The only way that we will overcome the opioid epidemic and help those Americans living with substance use disorders is if we finally treat them not as a criminal justice problem but as individuals in need of support and recovery,\" said O'Rourke.\n\n\"We must hold pharmaceutical corporations accountable for the damage they've caused, while investing in public awareness efforts and supporting access to long-term recovery.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nSponsored Content - Partnership for America's Health Care Future\n\nMedicare for All, Medicare buy-in, and the public option would all ultimately lead to the same harmful consequences of higher taxes and lower quality of care.
