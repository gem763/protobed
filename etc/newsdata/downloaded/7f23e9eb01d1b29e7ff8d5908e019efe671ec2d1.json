Meyer, said, that while some jurors were \u201cvery disturbed\u201d by Mr. Craig\u2019s conduct, \u201cwe could not find a basis to convict him.\u201d Mr. Meyer, 60, added that the law \u201cwas presented to us in a very narrow fashion.\u201d\n\nMr. Craig\u2019s defense team insisted that prosecutors had concocted a charge out of a few minor omissions of facts that Mr. Craig was never under any obligation to reveal. \u201cMr. Craig is not the kind of person who would lie to a U.S. government agency, not after a 50-year career based on character and trust,\u201d one of his lawyers, William Murphy, told the jurors.\n\nProsecutors said Mr. Craig gave in to hubris and self-interest, hiding the truth of his interactions with Mr. Sanger, not only from the Justice Department, but from his own firm\u2019s general counsel. Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez, one of the prosecutors, described Mr. Craig\u2019s final letter to the Justice Department on the matter as a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d of lies and half-truths.\n\n\u201cIf you read the letter, you will find contempt for the FARA unit,\u201d coupled with a sense of \u201centitlement\u201d and self-importance, he argued. He noted Mr. Craig proposed complaining to the attorney general himself if FARA officials did not accept his viewpoint.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s inquiry concerned a 2012 report that Mr. Craig and his law firm \u2014 Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom \u2014 performed for the Ukrainian government, then led by Viktor F. Yanukovych.", "description": "Jurors reached the verdict after just hours of deliberation.
