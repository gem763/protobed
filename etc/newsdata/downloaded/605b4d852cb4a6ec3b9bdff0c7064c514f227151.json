Show Hide Here is the list of the 21 Conservative MPs who voted with the opposition and against the government on Tuesday night\u2019s motion to seize control of the parliamentary timetable in order to pave the way for a bill to block a no-deal Brexit. Guto Bebb, Aberconwy Richard Benyon, Newbury Steve Brine, Winchester Alistair Burt, North East Bedfordshire Greg Clark, Tunbridge Wells Kenneth Clarke, Rushcliffe David Gauke, South West Hertfordshire Justine Greening, Putney Dominic Grieve, Beaconsfield Sam Gyimah, East Surrey Philip Hammond, Runnymede and Weybridge Stephen Hammond, Wimbledon Richard Harrington, Watford Margot James, Stourbridge Sir Oliver Letwin, West Dorset Anne Milton, Guildford Caroline Nokes, Romsey and Southampton North Antoinette Sandbach, Eddisbury Sir Nicholas Soames, Mid Sussex Rory Stewart, Penrith and The Border Edward Vaizey, Wantage\n\n\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the rebellion, the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, said there was a possibility of a reprieve if MPs reconsidered and voted against the bill expected to be tabled on Wednesday.\n\nThat peace offering was contradicted within an hour by a Downing Street spokesman. \u201cThe chief whip is speaking to those Tory MPs who did not vote with the government this evening. They will have the Tory whip removed.\u201d\n\nEd Vaizey, the former culture minister who had kept his intentions secret until the vote, said he felt liberated by his decision to rebel. \u201cWhen you hear those speeches in the House of Commons by Antoinette Sandbach and Ken Clarke, you just know you are on the right side,\u201d he said.\n\nNo 10 attempted a round of last-minute diplomacy ahead of the crunch vote, including convening a meeting with senior rebels such as Philip Hammond and David Gauke in Downing Street.\n\nSeveral waverers were approached personally by the prime minister \u2013 with one MP saying they had received two phone calls from Johnson just minutes before the vote. Some senior Conservatives appeared stunned at the extent of the rebellion, with cabinet ministers approaching MPs en route from the voting lobbies to ask if they had rebelled.\n\nSome Conservatives have privately voiced serious concern about the future of the party and unease at removing the whip from such long-serving MPs.\n\nOn Tuesday a number of the party\u2019s leading centrist voices, including Justine Greening, Nicholas Soames and Alistair Burt, announced they would stand down at the next election, and the former justice minister Phillip Lee defected to the Lib Dems, with most saying they saw no future in the party and condemning its direction under Johnson.\n\nBoris Johnson is threatening his own MPs, but I\u2019ll be voting to stop no-deal Brexit | Sam Gyimah Read more\n\nRory Stewart, the former international development secretary, also joked as he won GQ\u2019s politician of the year that it came on the night he had ceased to be a politician.\n\n\u201cIf anything, those threats have made it more difficult for MPs to back down, because if you decide to back the government in that circumstance, you are effectively saying you value your career over your principles,\u201d one MP said.\n\nSam Gyimah, the former universities minister, wrote in the Guardian: \u201cFor MPs like myself, Downing Street has framed the choice as: speak your mind or keep your job.\u201d\n\nMPs who rebelled included former cabinet ministers Philip Hammond, Greg Clark, David Gauke, Caroline Nokes, Stewart and Greening.\n\nMany more were former ministers including Steve Brine, Stephen Hammond, Anne Milton, Margot James, Guto Bebb, Dominic Grieve, Sam Gyimah, Richard Harrington, Oliver Letwin, as well as backbencher Antoinette Sandbach and Tory veterans Ken Clarke and Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill.\n\nSoames was among several Tory veterans who were deeply torn on whether to rebel after a fraught meeting with the prime minister on Tuesday, but he said he would rebel \u201cwith a very heavy heart\u201d because he believed there was no chance to get a deal by October. Afterwards he confirmed he would not stand at the next election.\n\nAnnouncing her decision to quit parliament at the election, Greening said it had become \u201cclear to me that my concerns about the Conservative party becoming the Brexit party have come to pass\u201d.\n\nBurt, one of the key sponsors of the rebel bill, said he had a \u201cfundamental and unresolvable disagreement with party leadership on the manner in which we leave the EU\u201d.\n\nStephen Hammond said he had hoped for reassurance from the government but had decided to reluctantly vote against the government.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very emotional time for a lot of us, I\u2019ve been agonising over it, I believe in everything this prime minister is doing pretty much, but I have said time after time that I would support a deal \u2026 but no deal is not acceptable,\u201d he said.\n\nPhilip Hammond and Johnson went head to head in a furious meeting of the rebels in Downing Street, shortly after the former chancellor told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he was gearing up for the \u201cfight of a lifetime\u201d, including preparing to take the Conservative party to court if Johnson deselected him as a candidate.\n\nPlay Video 1:30 Philip Hammond preparing for a political 'fight of a lifetime' \u2013 video\n\nThe last-ditch meeting, which included Hammond, Clark, James, Soames, Burt and Milton, was convened by Johnson at No 10 on Tuesday morning in an attempt to convince waverers about the implications of the bill and the negotiation progress.\n\nA source close to the rebel group said the prime minister\u2019s explanation was \u201cunconvincing\u201d about how a deal could be ratified, legally drafted, and legislated in the very short timeframe when parliament is not prorogued.\n\nDowning Street sources said officials had hit back at Hammond, saying he had been advised when he was in cabinet that the process could be done in as little as 17 days.\n\nHowever, several Tory MPs were also left concerned that there was no new information provided on how an alternative to the backstop had been devised and whether it had been provided to the EU, despite contributions in the meetings by Johnson\u2019s EU negotiator, David Frost, who insisted the government was seeing movement on the Irish side.\n\nThe culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, who has been sceptical about no deal, also told MPs they would have time to act before the deadline.\n\nOne government official said there had been a \u201cgenuine breadth of opinion in the room \u2026 some wanted to be convinced that a deal is possible and the prime minister made clear that the deal before the House will wreck that chance.\u201d\n\nHowever, one rebel source said that assertion was challenged and that \u201cno convincing proof was given that a real negotiation is taking place\u201d.\n\nThe source also called it \u201ca deliberate and willing misinterpretation\u201d of the bill to suggest it would hand power to Jeremy Corbyn, saying it gave the government \u201cmaximum flexibility to achieve a deal\u201d.\n\nIn a direct exchange with the prime minister, Hammond said rebels did not believe there was a serious negotiating strategy or team in place, or that the government would keep its word about the election date, a concern that one official likened to \u201ca conspiracy theory\u201d.\n\nHammond also challenged Johnson on his claim that the EU can apply conditions to any extension. \u201cPhilip made the point that the EU cannot \u2013 according to law, and to conversations he had with EU officials when he was in office,\u201d one source said.\n\nIn turn, Johnson and Michael Gove argued that the bill as it stood could lead only to indefinite uncertainty, suggesting it would inevitably result in a second referendum or the revoking of article 50, which rebel Tories have claimed they do not want.", "description": "Eight former cabinet ministers among 21 rebels who lose Conservative whip and face deselection", "authors": ["Jessica Elgot", "Tom Kibasi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df47522b7fe69e53c7323790a985fc14bfa9f79b/443_304_4461_2677/master/4461.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=676f8a7665e86e62e576349e804ae728"}
