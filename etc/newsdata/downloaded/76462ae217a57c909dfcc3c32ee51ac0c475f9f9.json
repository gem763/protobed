The icon called the song \"reductive\" in an interview with ABC.\n\nIn John's book, the 72-year-old admits that the songs \"definitely sound similar,\" but that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t see why [Madonna] was so ungracious and nasty about it \u2014 particularly when she claims to be a champion for women.\u201d\n\nELTON JOHN ON THE 'LION KING' REMAKE: IT'S 'A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT'\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just wrong,\" he added (via Yahoo! Entertainment). \"An established artist shouldn\u2019t kick down a younger artist right at the start of their career.\u201d\n\nJohn has offered heavy criticism of Madonna, 61, for a decade now, beginning in 2004, with John claiming she lip-synced in performances and that he believes \"everyone who lip-syncs on stage in public ... should be shot.\" He would later say she looks like a \"fairground stripper\" on an Australian newscast, according to Yahoo.\n\nELTON JOHN HIJACKED ROLLING STONES CONCERT HIGH ON COCAINE; KEITH RICHARDS WAS NOT HAPPY\n\nOf the television incident, John writes in his book: \u201cI was furious and I said some pretty horrible things about her to a TV interviewer in Australia, a guy I\u2019d known since the '70s called Molly Meldrum.\n\n\u201cYou can tell from the footage that it wasn\u2019t part of the interview, that I was just sounding off to an old friend between takes. \u2026 They broadcast it anyway, which brought that particular old friendship to a very swift conclusion. Still, I shouldn\u2019t have said it. I apologized,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Me\" contains many stories that take place throughout John's career, including interactions with the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan and even Elvis Presley.", "description": "Elton John is defending Lady Gaga in his new memoir, \"Me.\"", "authors": ["Nate Day"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/elton-john-madonna-lady-gaga.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
