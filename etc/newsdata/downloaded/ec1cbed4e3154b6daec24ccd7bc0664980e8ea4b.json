The blaring alarms likely caused further confusion and made an already stressful situation worse, according to the NTSB.\n\nA scenario like the one encountered by pilots in both crashes which triggered those alarms was never tested during the certification process. The government agency also said Boeing and the FAA need to consider testing every possible scenario when certifying a new plane.\n\nLindsey Wasson/Reuters, FILE\n\n\u201cWe saw in these two accidents that the crews did not react in the ways Boeing and the FAA assumed they would,\u201d NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt said in a statement. \u201cThose assumptions were used in the design of the airplane and we have found a gap between the assumptions used to certify the MAX and the real-world experiences of these crews, where pilots were faced with multiple alarms and alerts at the same time.\"\n\nSumwalt added that the safety recommendation report \"addresses that issue and does not analyze the actions of the pilots\" involved in the accidents.\n\nThe NTSB's new safety recommendations are not binding, meaning the FAA does not have to make any changes based on the report.\n\nThe FAA responded in a statement saying safety is its first priority and it welcomed the NTSB's recommendations.\n\n\"The agency will carefully review these and all other recommendations as we continue our review of the proposed changes to the Boeing 737 MAX,\" according to the statement. \"The FAA is committed to a philosophy of continuous improvement. The lessons learned from the investigations into the tragic accidents of Lion Air Flight 610and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 will be a springboard to an even greater level of safety.\"\n\nLindsey Wasson/Reuters, FILE\n\nIn October 2018, Lion Air Flight 610 crashed in the ocean just outside of Indonesia shortly after takeoff, killing all 189 on board, including three children. Less than six months later, in March 2019, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 also crashed just minutes after taking off from Ethiopia's capital, killing all 157 people on board, including eight Americans.\n\nThe 737 Max jets have been grounded since March.\n\nABC News' Whitney Lloyd contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/boeing-max-rt-jt-190926_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
