a leather bag costing \u00a3109 - has already sold out on the John Lewis website.\n\nIn a statement issued ahead of the launch, the Duchess said: \u201cSince moving to the UK, it has been deeply important to me to meet with communities and organisations on the ground doing meaningful work and to try to do whatever I can to help them amplify their impact.\n\n\u201cIt was just last September that we launched the \u2018Together\u2019 cookbook with the women of the Hubb Kitchen in Grenfell.\n\n\u201cNow, one year later, I am excited to celebrate the launch of another initiative of women supporting women, and communities working together for the greater good.\n\n\u201cWhen you buy any item in the Smart Set Capsule Collection for Smart Works, the same item will be given to a Smart Works client, and with it, the confidence and support she needs to enter the workforce and take an important step in building a career.\n\n\u201cThank you to the four brands who came together in supporting Smart Works on this special project - placing purpose over profit and community over competition.\n\n\u201cIn convening several companies rather than one, we\u2019ve demonstrated how we can work collectively to empower each other - another layer to this communal success story, that I am so proud to be a part of.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cSmart Set\u201d collection, made up from five pieces assigned to benefit charity Smart Works, will cost between \u00a319.50 and \u00a3199 and comes from British brands John Lewis, M&S and Jigsaw, and the Duchess\u2019s friend Misha Nonoo.\n\nFor every piece bought, one will be donated by the companies to help women back into the workplace through Smart Works, one of her patronages.\n\nThe items include a \u00a3109 John Lewis tote bag, available in black or tan, and an M&S shift dress costing \u00a319.50.\n\nA crisp white Smart Set shirt, similar to the \u201cHusband Shirt\u201d worn by Meghan Markle during her first outing with Prince Harry at the Invictus Games in Toronto, costs \u00a3125.\n\nJigsaw will sell black trousers and a cut blazer at \u00a3120 and \u00a3199 respectively, with matching items donated to Smart Works.\n\nThe clothes will come in size six to 24, and are available from 2pm online and in stores.\n\nSome fans have been buying them since the early hours of the morning, after spotting the John Lewis and M&S items on their websites.\n\nAll of the five items are part of the brand\u2019s existing collections, temporarily reassigned under the \u201cSmart Set\u201d label to benefit charity.\n\nThey will remain there for around two weeks, until Smart Works reaches its target of providing workwear for its clients throughout the UK for a year.\n\nA spokeswoman said the items are intended to fill the gaps in their client\u2019s back-to-work wardrobes, in a much wider range of sizes than their usual donations.\n\nEach client will receive two pieces during their initial fittings.\n\nDuring a launch event on the roof garden at John Lewis in Oxford Street, London, the Duchess is due to deliver a short speech and listen to a panel of speakers including two Smart Works clients.\n\nShe will then tour of a small number of stations set up to demonstrate the process women go through once they have been successfully referred to the charity.\n\nHosted by Kate Stephens, CEO, and Juliet Hughes-Hallett, chair and co-founder, the Duchess will hear from patrons and trustees including Jane Shepherdson, former CEO of Whistles and brand director at Topshop, and media executive Tiffanie Darke.\n\nFounded in September 2013, Smart Works coaches women as they prepare to return to work, providing outfits, interview practice and mentoring.\n\nHalf of clients are from an ethnic minority, long-term unemployed and have been unsuccessful with a large number of job applications, the charity said, with 64 per cent going on to get a job following their visit to Smart Works.", "description": "The Duchess of Sussex has launched a capsule fashion collection to help women back into the workplace, teaming up with British brands for a two-week-long sale.", "authors": ["Hannah Furness"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/h1R2O0TPNk35VqJulyclaA--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/8b5f8c9a44da6979dac85e1fe8607d34", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
