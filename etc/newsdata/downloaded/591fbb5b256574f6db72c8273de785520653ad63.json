The message is crystal clear.\n\nGurley\u2019s message arrives amid changing landscape\n\nAs the state of California leads a path to change in terms of athlete compensation with the recently passed Fair Pay to Play Act, Gurley stands with the athletes and proponents of change. The California law allows for college athletes to receive payment for their likeness without the threat of losing their amateur status and has the potential to force the NCAA\u2019s reluctant hand on the issue.\n\nWhile the NCAA rails against the rule, Gurley joins prominent sports figures like Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green and Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski in supporting change \u2014 even if his message doesn\u2019t directly address the law.\n\nTodd Gurley railed against the NCAA and delivered an ode to Brian Bosworth with a scathing T-shirt. (Getty)\n\nGurley\u2019s beef with the NCAA\n\nGurley had his issues with the NCAA when he was an amateur athlete. While at Georgia in 2014, the NCAA suspended Gurley for four games after reports that he got paid $3,000 for signing autographs and merchandise.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe was punished for receiving a small token on his legitimate value, an incident that obviously still sits with him since he\u2019s become a multi-millionaire and NFL star.\n\nOde to the Boz?\n\nGurley\u2019s shirt recalls the infamous T-Shirt Oklahoma star linebacker Brian Bosworth wore at the 1987 Orange Bowl. His take was a little more pointed than Gurley\u2019s, but in the same spirit, reading \u201cNational Communists Against Athletes.\u201d\n\nBosworth\u2019s T-shirt resulted in his being kicked off the Sooners, a moot but symbolic gesture as Bosworth was bound for the NFL the next season regardless.\n\nGurley is obviously long past the point of receiving any tangible backlash for speaking his mind on the NCAA and is happy to use his NFL platform to deliver a message.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Todd Gurley railed against the NCAA and delivered an ode to Brian Bosworth with a scathing T-shirt.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/D.BeACe2B06lTRVu8Nlv3A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Y03ZlsNccK2EgJSTDXCALQ--~B/aD0yNjU2O3c9Mzk4MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/687d04f0-ebc1-11e9-bef5-29c7dc47ad9c", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
