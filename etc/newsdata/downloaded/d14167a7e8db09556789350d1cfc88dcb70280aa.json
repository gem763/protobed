Boston Salmon via TKO (punches) \u2013 Round 1, 2:15\n\nUpdated records: Costa (5-1 MMA, 1-1 UFC), Salmon (6-3 MMA, 0-2 UFC)\n\nKey stat: Costa\u2019s 135-second knockout win was the longest fight of his five career wins.\n\nCosta on personal moment with Salmon\n\n\u201cMy parents sent me a picture and it was my parents and his parents together watching the weigh-ins. I was like, \u2018Dude, this is so cool.\u2019 So I went up and showed him, and when I showed him he gave me this gift bag from Hawaii. This is so cool. People get this crazy perception in this sport that you need to be a (expletive)head and talk (expletive). You don\u2019t need to do all that stuff. It\u2019s a sport. Have some respect. I love Boston. He\u2019s a good dude and I know he\u2019s going bounce back strong.\u201d\n\nCosta on winning his UFC debut in his hometown\n\n\u201cThis was just absolutely incredible. I achieved the dream. There were a lot of naysayers, and I think I proved them wrong. I think I showed a lot of composure in that fight. Getting my first UFC win in Boston, in the Garden, in the town that I was raised in is outrageous. I\u2019m just so happy to be here.\u201d\n\nCosta on what he wants next\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going on vacation this week and expect to come back at no less than 205 pounds, so unless they want to give me a fight at light heavyweight, then I\u2019m going to have to wait until the start of 2020 to get back in there.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Costa, check out the video of the full post-fight interview above.\n\nGallery Randy Costa def.
