Another tip? Write \"cloth bag\" at the top of your shopping list.\n\nEnright spoke with Fry about why the study does not excuse us from feeling guilty about the proliferation of plastic in our environment.\n\nClick 'listen' above to hear the full interview.", "description": "A British government study looked at the environmental impact of the life cycle of various shopping bags.
