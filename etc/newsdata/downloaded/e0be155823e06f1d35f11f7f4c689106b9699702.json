Dressed in a raw silk shirt-jacket, fringe pants, and a silk scarf, she is visibly pepped, and tells us it\u2019s high time women in science get prominence in the media. \u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d she says, with an admirable earnestness. Surprisingly, the entrepreneur claims to have never shot for a cover like this. \u201cThis is a long shoot, I will follow instructions,\u201d she quips, getting ready to face the camera.Shaw, 66, is the chairperson and managing director of Biocon Limited, a biotechnology company she kick-started in a garage in Bangalore in 1978. \u201cI take pride in terming Biocon the first tech start-up in the country,\u201d she beams. Her contribution to biotechnology earned her the Padma Shri (1989) and the Padma Bhushan (2005). In 2010, Shaw was named among TIME magazine\u2019s 100 most influential people in the world. In 2014, she was listed as the 92nd most powerful woman in the world by Forbes. In 2015, she shot to the 85th position. She featured on the list yet again in 2016 and 2017 at the 77th and 71st positions respectively. With credentials such as this, evidently, she has been there, done that, but \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe in the word \u2018retiring\u2019.\u201dTraining as a brewmaster was a bold decision for those times (\u201970s). I gained confidence and self-assurance when I topped my class at Federation University in Australia where I studied malting and brewing. I was the only woman amongst 10 men, and realised that gender doesn\u2019t matter. Knowledge is democratic; it\u2019s up to you to learn, and develop competence in anything you put your mind to.After returning to India, I was all set to pursue a career in brewing, but no one was willing to hire a woman. Companies entrusted me with troubleshooting, but wouldn\u2019t give me a managerial role. I tried repeatedly, but the male-managed industry was unwilling to take \u2018risks\u2019. I finally gave up, and began looking at the international job market. Around this time, an accidental encounter with an Irish biotech entrepreneur prompted me to start Biocon. If you ask me how I did it, it\u2019s because temperamentally, I was strong. I was in a man\u2019s world, but I was determined to make a success of myself.Although I possessed the temperament and determination to succeed, things didn\u2019t come easy. I was a financial risk for banks because they thought I didn\u2019t have collateral to offer them. The authorities also felt I didn\u2019t have relevant experience, and was trying to start a business which they didn\u2019t understand. Next, I was a job security risk for potential recruits as they felt that a woman employer couldn\u2019t give them stability. As a result, I went from bank to bank, having doors shut on me. Finally, a certain bank manager agreed to help, and extended a credit line. With that, I hired two retired tractor mechanics looking for income to kick-start production, rented an industrial shed near my place, bought equipment, and started the company.I was 25, and had started my company in a garage. You can imagine the odds. When you conduct interviews at a place like that, it doesn\u2019t evoke confidence in candidates. I couldn\u2019t even get a person who would work as my secretary. One of my dear friends, Pratima Rao, who was a school teacher back then, and is currently mission director, Biocon Foundation, took a break from her job, and helped me with secretarial support. I was on a path of proving naysayers wrong, or anyone who displayed scepticism.I didn\u2019t build Biocon alone; I was the captain of the ship. When the company was in its early stages, we were trying to woo our now CEO, a young engineer from MIT. We offered him a salary twice of what we were paying ourselves. We didn\u2019t mind that. Today, you wouldn\u2019t find that approach because people are insecure of letting a newcomer get a bigger stature. Those were the times!Never! We were an argumentative team that had an equal relationship with each other, irrespective of our genders. There was mutual respect, and collectively, we believed in leading rather than following. I have always told entrepreneurs that they must innovate, because that\u2019s the only way they will stand apart, and get noticed.I don\u2019t believe in a cut-throat approach because then, it means you are as good or bad as the other person. You have to be better. When it comes to my policy, patients (final consumers of Biocon products) come first. Without them, we wouldn\u2019t be in business. Companies today are so fixated on making money that they forget who their consumers are. Today, why is the pharma industry termed as greedy? Companies are marking their products expensive, not thinking about whether they are affordable by the public. In my case, I say, we must develop a business model that can provide affordable access to life-saving medicines; I am on that journey.My father taught me to never consider myself lesser than any man. In fact, he asked me to pursue a course in brewing, and when no organisation gave me a job, he said, \u2018It\u2019s their loss, they are stupid!\u2019 He was more upset than I was (smiles). He always told me, \u2018Kiran, money is not a currency to buy favours, it is a currency to make a difference.\u2019 I will remember these words till I die. He was so proud when Biocon began doing well. He never got to see my absolute success as he passed away in 1993, but due to his values, my family is supportive of women. As for my mother, she is an entrepreneur, and runs her company\u2014 a dry cleaning service\u2014at 88. She started the business after my father\u2019s demise, to keep herself engaged. It began with growing organic veggies, and then eventually, she got into the current business. Today, it\u2019s thriving.Entrepreneurship is exciting today, because when I decided to walk the path, there was no technology. We built hard core, real businesses. Today, the start-up world is different; anyone and everyone can become one so fast. There exists and ecosystem today that funds entrepreneurs, and they have the government\u2019s support as well.One must be true to himself/herself, and endure to succeed. Don\u2019t shift from one idea to another; focus on the journey, not the end goal. Plus, one shouldn\u2019t be an entrepreneur to get rich quickly. Youngsters today are in a hurry to get to the market, and many of them don\u2019t make it. There are no shortcuts, you know.I don\u2019t see gender parity issues in tech companies, but, I am sure, it exists in other industries, as the data supporting the thought pops up time and again. I feel that women are less demanding and negotiate less than men; they probably do so for leadership roles, if at all. Women still need to gain confidence, and fight for themselves and their rights.I don\u2019t like the word sacrifice; I believe we all make choices. In the past, when I was faced with the question, I would respond by saying\u2014maybe not having a family. But, in hindsight, that\u2019s not true. I made a choice to become an entrepreneur. The choices I make are based on my priorities and beliefs.At the end of the day, you have to look at what is saving lives. If a certain technology saves a life, isn\u2019t it important? If it can correct a genetic disorder for a young couple having a child, isn\u2019t it important? These are the debates we need to have. We get carried away and forget objectivity. I always ask\u2014you are okay with flushing those embryonic stem cells down the drain, but you have an objection to those cells saving a life. What kind of an argument is that? You have to look at it with a positive prism.If a society thrives because of your success, it helps you as well. Why would I not contribute to the society to improve roads, infrastructure, education, and healthcare? I want my society to grow along with me. It is important to share wealth in a fair way.On Sundays, I get up late, swim, and relax with family. I also catch up on Hindi movies with friends in the afternoons. In terms of holidays, I love beaches. At every possible opportunity, I head to the Maldives or Spain. The latter is a great country to go around; I have friends there. In India, I love to visit Hampi and Bandipur Tiger Reserve.I am constantly working on new things. I wish I was 25 years younger! There are many exciting things happening. I hope I never retire.", "description": "Kiran Mazumdar Shaw talks to Nikshubha Garg about her journey, proving naysayers wrong, and emerging as a winner.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/oct/sthkiran1570600959.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
