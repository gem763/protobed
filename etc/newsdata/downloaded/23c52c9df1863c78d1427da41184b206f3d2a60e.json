The Twins were third in the major leagues with 51.2% of their runs crossing the plate on dingers and the Yankees fourth at 51.1%, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Only Toronto (53.2%) and Milwaukee (51.5%) were more long-ball reliant.\n\n\u201cThere have been some wonderful teams that have played throughout the course of baseball history, but we\u2019ve never seen more home runs than we\u2019ve seen this year between these two teams,\u201d Minnesota manager Rocco Baldelli said. \u201cThe ability to change the game with one swing _ I think this is going to be a fun series in that way because the two teams that are playing probably have that quality, unlike any two teams maybe that have ever played the game.\u201d\n\nNelson Cruz (41 homers), Max Kepler (36), Miguel San\u00f3 (34), Eddie Rosario (32) and Mitch Garver (31) lead the Twins Cities Thrashers, hoping to reach the League Championship Series for the first time since 2002.\n\nGleyber Torres (38), Gary S\u00e1nchez (34), Brett Gardner (28), Aaron Judge (27) and DJ LeMahieu (26) top the Yankees, still smarting from losses to Boston in last year\u2019s Division Series and Houston in the 2017 ALCS.\n\nIn a season with a record 6,776 homers, the playoffs already have been high voltage. Batters went deep on the seventh pitch of the NL wild-card game and the fifth of the AL matchup.\n\nNow, the Twins and Yankees are ready to tee off in Game 1 on Friday.\n\n\u201cI feel like there\u2019s so many shifts and so many different things going on in the game, why would I want to put the ball on the ground for the most part? Ninety-nine percent of the time it\u2019s on the ground, it\u2019s an out,\u201d Judge said. \u201cI\u2019ve got three strikes. Why not take three chances to get one out of the park?\u201d\n\nNew York beat Minnesota in the 2003, 2004, 2009 and 2010 Division Series, then in the 2017 wild-card game after falling behind 3-0. The Yankees are 100-37 vs. the Twins since 2002, including 13-2 in the playoffs.\n\nCruz, styling in a shiny Phillip Plein skull and lightning bolt T-shirt, pointed out these Twins have high octane bats that make a difference: hence the Bomba Squad nickname coined by Rosario. An example was New York\u2019s 14-12, 10-inning win on July 23 at Target Field that included blown leads in the top and bottom of the eighth and ninth innings.\n\n\u201cAnyone in the lineup can do damage and turn the game around. Even the games that we\u2019re behind, we can find a way to come back or make it interesting,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI see the other teams being afraid of us, because anywhere we go they all talk about it.\u201d\n\nLeft-hander James Paxton (15-6, 3.82 ERA) starts the opener for the Yankees in his postseason debut. He struggled in first innings this year, allowing 12 of his 23 home runs, but he gave up just six homers overall in his final 11 starts.\n\n\u201cI threw a few more pitches in the bullpen second half of the season,\u201d Paxton said, \u201cso I could kind of get the first few hitters out of the way in the bullpen just so to try and sharpen myself up.\u201d\n\nRighty Jos\u00e9 Berr\u00edos (14-8, 3.82) goes for Minnesota. He entered the 2017 wild-card game with the score 4-4 and gave up Greg Bird\u2019s go-ahead single and Judge\u2019s two-run homer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve grown a lot as a player, inning by inning, game by game,\u201d Berrios said.\n\nBerr\u00edos was told with a week to go in the regular season that he would start Game 1. Baldelli didn\u2019t make the announcement until Thursday; the manager appears to have two classifications of information: secret and top secret.\n\n\u201cI can save everybody some time and energy. Maybe I can come up with something interesting to say, but we\u2019re probably not going to announce a ton roster-wise today,\u201d Baldelli told reporters.\n\nYankees manager Aaron Boone picked Masahiro Tanaka (11-9, 4.45) to start Game 2 on Saturday and Luis Severino (1-1, 1.50) for Game 3 at Minnesota on Monday. Lefty J.A. Happ (12-8, 4.91) will open the series in the bullpen but could be an option to start Game 4.\n\nBaldelli, speaking as rain forced workouts indoors, did not announce a Game 2 starter, though Jake Odorizzi (15-7, 3.51) is the most likely candidate.\n\nBoone dropped CC Sabathia from the roster because the 39-year-old lefty has a sore pitching shoulder. Sabathia hopes to be available for the ALCS.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to put the team in jeopardy,\u201d Sabathia said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be selfish and go out there hurt and put the team in a bad spot.\u201d\n\nEdwin Encarnaci\u00f3n, who hasn\u2019t played since Sept. 12 because of a strained left oblique, is likely to be on the Yankees roster after hitting in a pair of simulated games this week.\n\n\u201cI feel 100 percent, ready to go,\u201d he said.\n\nJudge, like most Yankees fans, views Friday is the real opening day.\n\n\u201cThey can say that 162 is the regular season, but that\u2019s spring training,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is when it counts. This is when it all counts. This is when it matters. The first one to 11.\u201d\n\nNotes: Minnesota\u2019s roster decisions include whether to pick rookie INFs Luis Arr\u00e1ez (sprained right ankle) and Ehire Adrianza (oblique). \u2026 New York must decide on whether to choose rookie Mike Ford over slumping 1B Luke Voit and INF-OF Tyle Wade, who could provide late-inning speed and defense.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Bronx Bombers vs. the Bomba Squad, matchup of the big league heavyweights.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ronald Blum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/alds_twins_baseball_18367_c0-181-4322-2700_s1770x1032.jpg?f01886b980ccbb6a38ff5909d47bf5aa48f900ab"}
