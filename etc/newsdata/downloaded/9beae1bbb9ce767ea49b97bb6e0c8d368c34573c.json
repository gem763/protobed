He or she plans to avoid being unmasked.\n\nAsked for a reaction, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told DailyMail.com: 'Takes a lot of conviction and bravery to write a whole book anonymously.'\n\nThe author plans to 'substantially' donate royalties 'to non-profit organizations that focus on government accountability and on supporting those who stand up for the truth in repressive countries around the world,' according to a press release.\n\nOne organization identified by Matt Latimer of Javelin is the White House Correspondents Association, which hosts a famed annual gala dinner where comedians and historians have excoriated Trump since before he ran for president.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's White House will be rocked next month by a book whose author penned a famous anonymous New York Times op-ed last year that criticized him\n\nLatimer told CNN that the author 'refused the chance at a seven figure advance.'\n\nAmazon is pre-selling the book for $30.00. The Kindle e-book version is priced at $15.99.\n\nLatimer and Keith Urbahn, co-agents for 'A Warning,' also represented former FBI Director James Comey and former Trump aide Cliff Sims in their tell-all book deals.\n\nA source with knowledge of the publishing deal said Tuesday that Javelin has '100% confidence' in the writer.\n\nThe author of the New York Times column, published in September 2018, was identified at the time only as a 'senior official' from inside the Trump administration, a broad category that became the basis of a guessing game inside the capital beltway.\n\n'There obviously will be those who want the author to reveal themselves publicly, but there are good reasons for that not to happen,' Latimer told The Washington Post.\n\n'The author feels their identity is almost irrelevant because there is scarcely a sentiment expressed in this book that is not shared by numerous others who have served and continue to serve this administration at its highest levels.'\n\nThe president attacked the author last year, suggesting alternatively that the op-ed might be an act of treason, and that the author might be a fictitious creation of the Times rather than a real person.\n\n'Does the so-called \u201cSenior Administration Official\u201d really exist, or is it just the Failing New York Times with another phony source?' he tweeted at hte time.\n\n'If the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist, the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!'\n\nAn hour earlier Trump had tweeted a single word: 'TREASON?'\n\nTrump blasted the unnamed author after the op-ed sent Washington into a dizzying guessing game\n\nThe president tweeted a single word to sum up his leanings about the essay last year\n\nThe Times op-ed described the president as 'impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective' in the way he manages the government, and says the author is part of an organized 'resistance' whose goal is 'to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Trump's more misguided impulses until he is out of office.'\n\nDuring a White House event with a group of sheriffs, Trump said the writer was 'probably... failing and probably here for all the wrong reasons.'\n\nSarah Sanders, then the White House press secretary said in a statement at the time that the essay was 'pathetic, reckless, and selfish' and challenged the Times to 'issue an apology.'\n\n'This is just another example of the liberal media's concerted effort to discredit the President,' she said then.\n\nThe press release announcing the book's existence came in a PDF titled 'December Title.' Javelin did not respond on Tuesday to a question about why the release of 'A Warning' was bumped up to November.", "description": "The unnamed author will release a book next month - an extended-play version of the essay that turned Washington on its head with speculation.", "authors": ["David Martosko", "U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/20/20051636-0-image-a-15_1571772843768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
