If you don\u2019t know the science, how can you do that?\u2019 Piers noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Well, I am just a broccoli,\u2019 the guest said before taking out a banana from his jacket pocket and pretending it was a phone.\n\nPiers then snapped: \u2018The trouble is Mr Broccoli, had you made a very coherent, powerful, science-based argument, you would have had a real impact.\n\n\u2018You would have a lot of attention through the way you dressed up for your cause, but to come on here and just be an idiot makes us think you\u2019re just an idiot.\u2019\n\nOh, how we love Good Morning Britain.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
