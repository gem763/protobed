(Photo: John Minchillo, AP)\n\nTwelve Democratic presidential candidates will take the stage Tuesday at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, for their fourth primary debate.\n\nThe event, hosted by CNN and The New York Times, begins at 8 p.m. EDT.\n\nTrump, RNC announce $125.7 million fundraising haul\n\n7:50 p.m. ET\n\nDemocrats will be on the debate stage Tuesday, but President Donald Trump's campaign is still looming large.\n\nThe Trump campaign, campaign committees, and the Republican National Committee announced a $125.7 million fundraising haul for the third Federal Elections Commission filing quarter as Democrats prepared to take the stage for the fourth Democratic presidential debate.\n\nIn a release, the campaign said all of the groups would have $158 million cash on hand.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s campaign is a juggernaut on an unstoppable path to victory in November 2020,\u201d Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said.\n\nAccording to the Trump campaign, it received 1,056,126 individual donations last quarter, with an average donation of $44.50.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., raised about $25 million last quarter, the most out of any of the Democratic contenders.\n\n\u2013 Nicholas Wu\n\nBattle of the young guys: Beto v. Buttigieg\n\n7:40 p.m. ET\n\nExpect sharper elbows from South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has already called out Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders this week while trading barbs with former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nThe Indiana mayor launched a digital ad Monday explicitly attacking Sanders and Warren for their support for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and instead touting his \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It\u201d plan.\n\nEarlier this week, Buttigieg faced off with former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke over a mandatory buyback program for assault rifles, a policy O\u2019Rourke made headlines over in the last debate.\n\nEarlier this month O\u2019Rourke slammed Buttigieg for his hesitancy over support for the program. The mayor responded to the criticism earlier this week in an interview with Snapchat\u2019s \u201cGood Luck America.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get it. He needs to pick a fight in order to stay relevant,\u201d Buttigieg said Monday.\n\nO\u2019Rourke responded in a tweet: \u201cPete can belittle the grassroots; he can call buybacks a \u2018shiny object.\u2019 He can say whatever he wants, but guns kill 40,000 people year.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Courtney Subramanian\n\nPelosi delivers debate question to stage\n\n7:15 p.m. ET\n\nThe dozen Democrats on the debate stage in Ohio will have to answer a boatload of uncomfortable questions Tuesday about health issues, the age of the field's frontrunners and foreign entanglements in the Ukraine \u2013 to name a few.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi just threw another touchy issue into the queue: Should the House hold a vote to formalize the impeachment Democrats announced at a press conference three weeks ago? Less than two hours before the debate got underway, Pelosi announced that he House would hold off on that vote for now.\n\nRepublicans have noted that every previous impeachment inquiry was preceded with a vote in the House to set up a special committee to conduct the investigation. Democrats say they don\u2019t need to do that \u2013 and the Constitution doesn\u2019t explicitly require it \u2013 but Republicans have raised process questions to hammer away at the inquiry and the White House has said it won\u2019t provide documents absent a vote.\n\n\u2013 John Fritze\n\nDems send signal by debating in Ohio\n\n7:05 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Donald Trump won Ohio in 2016 by 8 points, rebranding a state long seen a presidential battleground into one that is older, whiter and more Republican.\n\nWhen Trump won the state it raised questions about Ohio's ability to mirror the national mood, according to Kyle Kondik, author of \"The Bellwether.\"\n\nBy holding their debate Otterbein University outside of Columbus, Democrats are signaling they\u2019re not conceding the state.\n\n\"I am absolutely confident that battleground Ohio will once again be in Democratic hands,\" Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez told reporters from state and national news organizations.\n\nDemocrats see hope in the suburbs, which have swung their way. That\u2019s why Tuesday night\u2019s debate will take place in an Ohio suburb that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 but switched to Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nThe reason Ohio has become much more Republican relative to the nation? It's significantly whiter with a smaller share of college graduates than average. That\u2019s not the case in Westerville, however, the town where the debate is being held.\n\nSo unless Democrats can improve their standing with white voters without four-year college degrees, they'll have a hard time carrying Ohio in 2020, Kondik concludes in an analysis for the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics.\n\n-- Cincinnati Enquirer, Maureen Groppe, Maureen and John Fritze\n\nBloomberg: Are we hiring a legislator in chief?\n\n7 p.m. EDT\n\nIs former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg still considering a run for president? Based on an op-ed published hours before the debate Tuesday in the Washington Post, it sure looks like he\u2019s eager to remain in the mix.\n\nBloomberg \u2013 who initially announced he wouldn\u2019t run but who more recently has reportedly told allies he\u2019d consider it if Biden falters \u2013 writes that the current field of candidates is talking about the wrong things.\n\n\u201cRarely are the candidates asked, and more rarely still do they talk about, how they would go about achieving their goals,\u201d said Bloomberg, who is known for overseeing a technocratic administration that came on the heels of another former New York leader who\u2019s been in the news a lot lately: Rudy Giuliani.\n\n\u201cThe job\u2019s essential skills primarily involve leadership and management, not policy analysis,\u201d Bloomberg writes. \u201cThe country elects a commander in chief, and yet based on the campaign so far, one might think we are electing a legislator in chief.\u201d\n\nBloomberg also uses the piece to take a swipe at Trump. Bloomberg says he spoke with the president shortly after the 2016 election and advised him to hire people \u201cwho are smarter than you.\u201d\n\nSo how did Trump do? A few good hires, Bloomberg opines, otherwise not very well.\n\n\u201cMostly he hired cronies, ideologues and sycophants,\u201d Bloomberg wrote, \u201cwhile also leaving hundreds of important senior level positions unfilled and paying less attention to many agencies than he does to cable TV news.\u201d\n\n\u2013 John Fritze\n\nAre you smarter than a bookie?\n\n6:50 p.m. EDT\n\nBetting sites are taking all kinds of wagers on tonight\u2019s debate, including on whether Bernie Sanders will withdraw from the race, whether anyone will curse on stage, who will be tweeted about most, and how many times certain words will be said.\n\nCan you rank these words by the frequency in which SportsBetting.ag thinks they will be uttered? Billionaire. Impeach. China. Obama (as mentioned by Biden).\n\nIf you guessed China, impeach, billionaire and then Biden references to Obama, you\u2019re thinking like a bookie. (The over/under on the China mentions is 40.5 and the over/under on Biden references to Obama is 3.5.)\n\n\u2013 Maureen Groppe\n\nAOC's barb at Mayor Pete\n\n6:45 p.m. EDT\n\nA growing battle between Pete Buttigieg and the party\u2019s progressive wing escalated in the lead-up to the debate.\n\nButtigieg released a new digital ad drawing a distinction between his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d health care plan and the proposal backed by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The ad says Sanders and Warren \u201cbelieve that we have to force ourselves into `Medicare for all,\u2019 where private insurance is abolished.\u201d\n\nThe ad is running in Iowa where a new poll from Firehouse Strategies has Buttigieg in third place, having moved ahead of Sanders.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s increased attempts to go after the frontrunners include this comment he made Monday about Warren\u2019s eschewing small donor strategy: \u201cWe're not going to beat Trump with pocket change.\u201d\n\nIn a tweeted response, Progressive icon Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said the grassroots campaigning that Buttigieg \u201cinsults\u201d has outraised him.\n\nAnd the Progressive Change Campaign Committee boasted that \u201cnumerous progressive voices sent warning flares to Mayor Pete before Tuesday's debate.\u201d\n\n\u201cMayor Pete has been a rising star. But he needs to stop this,\u201d the political action committee wrote in a fundraising email to supporters Tuesday.\n\nTrump's one-word attack\n\n6:40 p.m. EDT\n\nThe Trump campaign\u2019s response to the Democratic debate can be summed up in one word: socialism.\n\nIn a full-page ad in today\u2019s Columbus Dispatch the campaign argues that Democrats\u2019 \u201cbig government socialism will wreck Ohio\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nBanners scheduled to fly above the city of Westerville during the afternoon shouted \u201cSOCIALISM DESTROYS OHIO JOBS.\u201d\n\nThe campaign says Democrats would raise taxes, eliminate private health insurance and increasing electrical bills by \u201cending fossil fuels.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat to expect\n\n5:50 p.m. EDT\n\nThe Westerville debate is the first since House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump last month over the Ukraine scandal. Joe Biden will have a chance to push back forcefully on the president's efforts to get officials in Ukraine to investigate him and his son, Hunter. But Biden also may face questions about the appropriateness of his son's having served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company when Biden was vice president.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will take the stage two weeks after having a heart attack.\n\nSen.

What are the issues? Here are 4 things you need to know\n\nThe nine other candidates on stage will make the debate the largest presidential primary debate in the nation's recorded history, according to the New York Times.\n\nThey will have three hours, in snippets of 75 seconds or less, to make their case to the voters.\n\n\u2013 Maureen Groppe\n\nTom Steyer enters the fray\n\nOn stage for the first time will be billionaire Tom Steyer who has pumped millions of dollars into a campaign to impeach Trump.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful US billionaire philanthropist Tom Steyer speaks during a town hall devoted to LGBTQ issues hosted by CNN and the Human rights Campaign Foundation at The Novo in Los Angeles on October 10, 2019.

Steve Bullock, the only remaining governor running, and self-help author Marianne Williamson.\n\nThe polling numbers and fundraising support required to participate will ratchet up further for the November debate.\n\nImpeachment: 5 ways the Trump impeachment inquiry will loom large at Tuesday's Democratic debate\n\n\u2013 Maureen Groppe\n\nA more aggressive Biden?\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden gestures as he speaks during a town hall devoted to LGBTQ issues on Oct. 10, 2019. (Photo: ROBYN BECK, AFP via Getty Images)\n\nJoe Biden told supporters at a California fundraiser last week that he's had a target on his back at the debates because he began the race as a frontrunner. He's facing competition for his frontrunner status, though. Elizabeth Warren has been climbing in the polls. In some surveys, she polls slightly higher than him while in others Biden maintains an edge.\n\nBiden also enters the debate facing questions about how well he's handled the Ukrainian controversy and having just been outraised by three of his opponents in the last quarter.\n\nPlus, in an interview that aired Tuesday morning, Hunter Biden repeatedly admitted he made a \"mistake\" in not calculating the political ramifications of joining the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father had official business in the country as vice president.\n\nSo should we expect a different Biden from the last three rounds?\n\n\u201cOne of the problems I\u2019m finding, I\u2019ve got to be more aggressive,\u201d Biden said at the fundraiser. \u201cWhich is good, I\u2019m not complaining, I\u2019m a big boy,\u201d he said, while explaining that the debates' time restraints don\u2019t allow time for full answers.\n\n\u2013 Maureen Groppe\n\nLikable enough?\n\nWhile debates offer a chance for contenders to stand out by attacking an opponent, that can be difficult to do while remaining likable. And a poll out Tuesday underscores why Democrats need to stay in good graces with voters.\n\nThe latest findings from the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service Battleground Poll show Trump isn\u2019t the only one who has a higher unfavorability than favorability rating. For six of the seven Democratic hopefuls tested, more voters had a negative opinion than a positive one. The exception was Pete Buttigieg, but 39% of respondents had no opinion of him or had never heard of him.\n\n\u2013 Maureen Groppe\n\nContributing: Nicholas Wu\n\nA seat is reserved at the fourth Democratic debate for Chasten Buttigieg, husband of presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg.
