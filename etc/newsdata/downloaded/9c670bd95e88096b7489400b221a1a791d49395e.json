Was here about a week. Patriots moving on.\n\n\n\nFerentz now looking like the backup center. Spent a lot of time at guard this summer. Karras got the center reps when Andrews was out. https://t.co/ysFW1soy5l\n\n\n\n\u2014 Phil Perry (@PhilAPerry) September 6, 2019\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
