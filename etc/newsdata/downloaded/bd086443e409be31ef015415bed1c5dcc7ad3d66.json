It\u2019s hard to say, really. That\u2019s sort of the problem.\n\nThe issue we had with Facebook serves as a miniature lesson about transparency and our mistrust big tech. For some reason, a story about Zuckerberg we posted to our Facebook page was hidden from many readers.\n\nThe post was fully visible through web browsers in incognito mode, but an unclear percentage of users were told, \u201cSorry, this content is not available,\u201d when they tried to view it while signed in.\n\nIn short, lots of people (including several Gizmodo staffers and at least one of their parents) could not see the story. By late Friday, the issue seemed to resolve itself just as mysteriously.\n\nMy dad is texting me b/c he thinks Facebook is making Giz articles disappear pic.twitter.com/ToRhI96l7p \u2014 dead cameron (@dellcam) October 4, 2019\n\nWas it a bug, a moderation error, or something more nefarious? Personally, I find it hard to imagine Zuckerberg furiously refreshing Gizmodo\u2019s page, just waiting to slam the giant red button on his desk labelled \u201cWRONGTHINK.\u201d But it\u2019s easy to see why some people believe similar (if less cinematic) conspiracy theories.\n\nWhen Facebook acts strangely \u2014 which is fairly often! \u2014 users have to draw their own conclusions about what\u2019s happening. Like most big tech companies, Facebook doesn\u2019t offer a phone number to call if you\u2019re having issues. If you want a response from a social network about your specific problem, your best bet is to be a journalist, a celebrity, or someone else with the power to give headaches.\n\nTo understand their experiences with social media, then, most people are left with two choices: trust the system (lol) or develop their own, potentially very wacky, explanations.\n\nWe can see this in a common conspiracy theory that posits Facebook is secretly recording users\u2019 conversations \u2014 to show them more relevant ads, of course. The supporting evidence is anecdotal.\n\nAfter verbally discussing one product or another, a user notices an advertisement for it on Facebook. In a 2016 blog post, the company denied the rumour outright, and despite subsequent revelations about overtly recorded audio, proof of the claim has never been found.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening then? Something much creepier, probably. Using both the information you share and that provided by your friends and family, the platform can infer your interests so well that it might as well be listening in. At least that\u2019s what we think! Some attentional bias might also be at play. Truthfully, even the best-informed journalists are kind of in the dark.\n\nContent moderation bias is perhaps an even more contentious issue, and here, at least, Facebook has something approaching an answer. What looks like targeted censorship, you see, is just a series of fuckups.\n\nIn a transcript of an internal meeting published by the Verge on Thursday, Zuckerberg blamed \u201cmost\u201d of the platform\u2019s moderation issues on the judgment of individual workers:\n\n[P]eople say \u201coh well no, you just did this because you\u2019re trying to censor some group of people\u201d or \u201cyou just did this because you don\u2019t care about protecting this group of people.\u201d It\u2019s really not that. [...] It\u2019s just that there\u2019s one thing to try to have policies that are principled. It\u2019s another to execute this consistently with a low error rate, when you have 100 hundred billion pieces of content through our systems every day.\n\nIncidentally, in that same story, the Verge assured readers that Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks were not deliberately leaked by Facebook. But how could they know? Short of mind-reading (something Facebook is working on, by the way), it\u2019s impossible to completely ascertain the motives of a source, much less the full provenance of the information they offer.\n\n\u201cKnowing\u201d things about Facebook \u2014 or any of the other enormous tech companies that now control much of our lives \u2014 is a frustrating game. They will talk your ear off with generalities, but if you want to learn, say, just how many police departments Amazon is partnering with to sell surveillance doorbells, you better do some paperwork, buddy.\n\nSome may believe \u2014 as Zuckerberg himself seems to \u2014 that companies like Facebook are just too big to explain every little thing they do their millions of users. Maybe so, but is it any surprise, then, that no one fucking trusts them?\n\nWe reached to Facebook about the weird ghost post issue and will update this story if and when they reply.", "description": "On Friday, Gizmodo uncovered shocking new evidence that Facebook is using its platform to suppress stories about CEO Mark Zuckerberg... or maybe his janky, busted-arse website is just bugging out again for no reason.
