Before it debuts, fans will be able to see what the character has been up to in a new comic series and novel, says StarTrek.com.\n\nThe company announced that IDW Publishing will release a three-issue comic series called Star Trek: Picard \u2014 Countdown, which will be written by Mike Johnson and Kirsten Beyer, who is a supervising producer on the TV show. The series will be about a mission that changes Picard\u2019s life. In February, Simon & Schuster will release a prequel novel called Star Trek: The Last Best Hope, which will lead directly into the show and introduce a number of new characters in it. That book will be written by Una McCormack, who\u2019s written a number of Star Trek tie-in novels over the years.\n\nLike Disney\u2019s Star Wars, Star Trek has a long history of official tie-in novels. There have certainly been plenty of books and comics that have expanded upon the Next Generation series (although Star Trek\u2019s canon typically only includes the films and TV episodes). These two projects will help fill a bit of the 20-year gap between the end of Star Trek: Nemesis and the beginning of Picard. In the first full trailer for the new series, we saw that Picard has retired from Starfleet and taken up residence at his family\u2019s vineyard in France.\n\nCBS hasn\u2019t announced an exact date for when Picard will begin streaming on All Access, only that it will be coming in 2020.", "description": "CBS is bringing back Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: Picard, a new series for its streaming platform, All Access, sometime next year.
