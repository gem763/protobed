It is 24 metres (78 feet) long, solar-driven, fully autonomous and able to collect plastic in rivers around the clock, Slat said.\n\nPlaced at strategic positions in a river system, its barrier directs plastic to the waiting \u201cmouth\u201d of the barge, from where it rolls up a conveyor belt and is dumped into one of six dumpsters.\n\nThe barge has a capacity to carry 50 cubic metres of waste plastic, the equivalent of 271,000 Rubik\u2019s cubes, said Slat.\n\nOnce full, an onboard computer sends a message to local operators to pull out the dumpsters and empty them \u201cas easily as you would clean your vacuum,\u201d Slat said at the unveiling of the machine.\n\nThe project will tackle 1,000 of the most polluting rivers in the world \u201cwithin five years\u201d, which contribute to 80 percent of global plastic pollution, he added.\n\nTwo of the machines are already up and running: one in Jakarta, Indonesia, and another in Malaysia. A third is being prepared for deployment in Vietnam.\n\nSlat used a fourth Interceptor for the presentation in the port city of Rotterdam\u2019s harbour on Saturday. This one will be sent to the Dominican Republic, he said.\n\nEarlier this month, The Ocean Cleanup announced that a special ship designed to clean the world\u2019s oceans had harvested its first plastic from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.", "description": "The Hague (AFP) \u2013 A Dutch non-profit group committed to ridding the world\u2019s waters of plastic, Saturday unveiled their latest invention, a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/d0e9ca_model-on-display-was-fourth-built-is-due-dominican-republic-dutch-inventors-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
