In August he was also attacked by at least two people with a baseball bat and knife.\n\n'Horrifying attack'\n\nPolice later showed up at the scene of the attack on Arran Lane, a few blocks from Mong Kok.\n\nThe opposition Demosisto party, however, denounced the officers for failing to \"set up any blockade at the crime scene\".\n\nA video posted by Demosisto also showed one police officer stepping on bloodstains at the spot where Sham was attacked.\n\nIn a statement, Joshua Rosenzweig of Amnesty International urged authorities to \"promptly conduct an investigation into this horrifying attack\".\n\n\"Anything less would send a chilling signal that such attacks are tolerated by the authorities,\" he said.\n\nSham, who is running for a seat in the district council election in November, has been at the forefront in the campaign for the Hong Kong government to deliver the so-called \"five demands\", including the complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, an independent investigation into alleged police brutality and universal suffrage for the Hong Kong Legislative Council and Chief Executive.\n\nOn Thursday, the CHRF urged people to come out and join the protest on Sunday \"to stand their ground and show the perpetrators and this regime that we will not stand down\".\n\nProtests in Hong Kong began in opposition to an extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent to China for trial, but have broadened into a pro-democracy movement amid fears that Beijing is undermining Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms. The bill is due to be formally withdrawn this week.\n\nThe unrest has plunged Hong Kong into its worst crisis since Britain handed it back to China in 1997 and poses the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.\n\nProtesters believe China has been eroding Hong Kong's freedoms, guaranteed under a \"one country, two systems\" formula introduced with the 1997 handover.", "description": "Groups express shock after at least four hammer-wielding suspects attacked protest leader Jimmy Sham near Mong Kok.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/17/a3631711328b4d2eafa694451859f00a_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
