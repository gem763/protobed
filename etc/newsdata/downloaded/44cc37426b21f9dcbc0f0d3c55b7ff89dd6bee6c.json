I've always been open-minded about that sort of thing, so I decided to give it a go and drink it fresh.\n\n'It tasted a bit like a bitter ale initially, it was quite strong but not a terrible taste and I had no problem finishing the glass.\n\n'It was about half an hour later that I started to feel amazing, I was absolutely bursting with energy. Now I'd never go a day without it and would recommend it to anyone.'\n\nFabian first started researching alternative medicines and holistic therapies in 2013, when he kept experiencing pains in his stomach which doctors couldn't get to the bottom of.\n\nHe said: 'I was travelling a lot for work and eating junk food - Burger King, McDonald's, anything convenient.\n\n'I was getting a lot of pain in my stomach and scans couldn't find an ulcer or anything that could explain it, so I started looking online more and more.\n\nThe interior designer starts every day with a pint of fresh urine, chased down with 300-400ml of aged pee, and claims the unusual thirst quencher has left him feeling healthier, happier and smarter\n\n'I've always been quite into holistic health but that was when I started to adopt it into my life more - starting with my diet.'\n\nOriginally from Birmingham, Fabian adopted a 'fruitarian' diet - eating raw fruits almost exclusively - and immediately noticed a difference.\n\nFabian recalled: 'I started to eliminate 'normal' foods and ate only fruit.. I'll use mangoes, pineapple, strawberries - any fruit really, and add in chia seeds, flax seeds and hemp powder to make a smoothie.\n\n'I quickly started to feel amazing. I had more energy than I had in years, and could feel my well being improving.'\n\nFrom there, his foray into a more alternative approach to health escalated and in 2015 Fabian decided to take the plunge and drink his urine.\n\nFabian said that his friends and family 'weren't that surprised' - because he has always been a bit off the wall in his approach to health.\n\nAfter enjoying the 'benefits' of fresh urine, he quickly began to leave some for up to a month - or until it reaches the desired PH level of nine.\n\nThe idea, Fabian says, is that by ageing it the urine goes through a 'magnification process' and any alleged benefits will be more potent.\n\nExplaining the process of ageing his urine, Fabian said: 'I store it in glass containers like mason jars, label it with the date and then leave it for around 30 days.", "description": "Fabian Farquharson, 37, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, first started the bizarre practise three years ago after reading about the\u00a0purported health benefits online.", "authors": ["Jessica Green For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/03/03/12/10517932-0-image-a-19_1551616889501.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-03"}
