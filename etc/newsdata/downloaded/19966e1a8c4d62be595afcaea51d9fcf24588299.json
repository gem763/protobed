Five years before that it would have seen like a science fiction.\u201d\n\nThe decision by the UK to leave the European Union has created political turmoil at home and sent ripples of instability throughout the whole bloc. Harari said the future of the EU lies with voters and that he hopes they will make the right decision because it has global consequences.\n\nRead more: European elections 2019\n\nHe said the decisions Europeans make about their future are crucial: \u201cNot just for the peace of Europe and the prosperity of Europe. It is really essential for the peace and prosperity of the entire world.\u201d\n\nHarari discusses politics with Austrian chancellor\n\nHarari also expressed the need for close co-operation between nations to combat many global challenges including technology designed to alter or imitate humans.\n\n\u201cPeople should realise humankind is now facing three existential threats that cannot be solved on the national level,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can only be solved on the global level.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese threats are nuclear war, climate change and technological disruption, especially the rise of Artifical Intelligence (AI) and bioengineering. AI and biotechnology could destroy what it means to be human.\u201d\n\nHe said that an \u201carms race\u201d in AI would result in the destruction of humanity.\n\n\u201cWhoever wins this race it doesn\u2019t matter, humanity will be the loser.\u201d\n\nThe good and evil of nationalism\n\nOn the rise of nationalism, Harari said it was a concept that was often misunderstood.\n\n\u201cNationalism has been among the most positive developments of human history but also has a dangerous side,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe positive side of nationalism is that it enables millions of strangers to care about one another and to co-operate. The other side, the evil side of nationalism, is about hating foreigners.\u201d\n\nHarari cites anecdotal examples of people who may be corrupt or take money from the state system but still claim to be good patriots because of their dislike of foreigners.\n\nWatch: Trump meeting may help Orban in European elections\n\nHarari suggests that fake news is not a new thing but that there has been a huge development in technology which has been able to manipulate and exploit human vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cThe problem we are facing now is that technology is overcoming our weaknesses. We now have powerful technologies that can identify your weaknesses; - what you already fear what you already hate - and grab your attention by pressing these emotional buttons.\u201d\n\nHe says much tighter regulation is needed to restrict potentially harmful technologies and avoid the risk of human attention being abused by unscrupulous leaders or governments.\n\n\u201cI think that now the technology makes it possible to create far more totalitarian regimes than anything we have seen in human history. Even more extreme than what George Orwell imagined.\u201d\n\nHe said the Orwellian vision was limited to governments monitoring only overt activity but contemporary technology is more invasive than that.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re getting technology to monitor people 24 hours a day, the entire population and even what is happening inside their bodies. With biometric sensors and the combination of AI and biotechnology.\u201d\n\nHe cites the example in some Chinese schools where students wear biometric bracelets to monitor if a child is bored or tired.\n\n\u201cBut the same technology can be used for political purposes,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw in the 20th century with Stalin or Hitler or Mao will be nothing compared to these kinds of machines that have already started to be built today.\u201d\n\nSuperhumans through 'biotech'\n\nHe expressed deep concerns about the misuse of some other technologies too, such as biotechnology. The science involves the modification of organisms for specific purposes and is commonly used in things like agriculture, brewing and baking. But it can also apply to the genetic modification of humans. He says that is very worrying.\n\n\u201cIf we don't utilise the new technologies correctly, then the result is \u2026 Biotechnology will be used to upgrade a small elite into a superhuman status, whereas most people are left far behind.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in history, the rich will be a different species from the poor. That\u2019s the greatest inequality in history.\u201d\n\nHumanity's 'dark sides'\n\nHarari lives in Israel and is a professor in the Department of History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He also spoke about his home country and said living there can sometimes be enlightening.\n\n\u201cThe situation in Gaza is really terrible for the people living there, but in Israel, most of the time, most people live a very normal life.\u201d\n\nHe says that, if he lived elsewhere, he may not be as aware of all the good and bad aspects of technology.\n\n\u201cIf you live in Israel, you realise that humankind has a lot of the dark sides to it.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Harari ensures that he can switch off from rapidly expanding technologies by attending a long meditation retreat at least once a year.\n\nHe says it is essential to disconnect and reflect.\n\n\u201cWe need to make the most important decisions in the history of humankind in the next few years. We now have divine powers of creation and destruction. And its humans, not gods who need to decide what to do with them.\u201d\n\nHe said high profile figures such as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz do not have time to think and consider the importance of their actions while they are managing crises.\n\nWatch Yuval Noah Harari's full The Global Conversation interview in the player above.", "description": "Historian and philosopher Yuval Noah Harari calls for global co-operation to stop Artificial Intelligence becoming as big a threat to humankind as climate change and nuclear war", "authors": ["Philip Andrew Churm"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/87/78/54/1000x563_cmsv2_9a40d923-21ac-504e-abea-d40700424b6f-3877854.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-14"}
