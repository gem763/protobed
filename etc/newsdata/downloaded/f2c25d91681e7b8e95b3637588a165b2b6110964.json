Whether it was good or ill, history will have to judge.\n\nIt is well known that Manchester United were ill-prepared for Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement\n\nBayern Munich\u2019s Jerome Boateng was Mourinho\u2019s preference. Previously, United would have probably buckled to such an emphatic request from a manager. After all, they had done so often with Louis van Gaal.\n\nEven the casual observer could have pointed to the 2017-18 season in which Boateng had started just 19 games and been substituted in four of those between 62 and 82 minutes. Yet the analysis clearly went deeper than that and indicated that, whether a defender should be signed or not, Boateng wasn\u2019t United\u2019s man.\n\nIt was the recruitment department\u2019s decision but it was left to Woodward to communicate it to Mourinho. One can only imagine how that went. It certainly seemed to be a turning point in their relationship. From the outside, it seemed to poison the atmosphere irredeemably thereafter. Yet the feeling within the club was that it had to be done.\n\nRight now it doesn\u2019t look like United are heading anywhere but down. Take their most recent defeat against Newcastle. It felt like a new nadir of awfulness, and there have been a few of those in the past six years.\n\nSince the Scot's departure, things have gone from bad to worse, starting with David Moyes\n\nPredicted lineups for Sunday's game Manchester United (4-3-3): Romero; Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Young; Pereira, McTominay, Fred; James, Martial, Rashford. Liverpool (4-3-3): Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Matip, Van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Mane.\n\nHowever you arrange the stats it looks grim: their worst start in 30 years; they have 17 points from 16 games since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was confirmed as permanent manager in March; in that period they are the fourth worst Premier League team. Today they have to take on Liverpool, a club with whom their history will be forever entwined and to whom they will always be compared.\n\nLiverpool, who seemed no threat whatsoever when Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, are European champions, perhaps the best team in the world. Maybe even more painful, they have achieved that with American owners \u2014 like United\u2019s, but appreciated \u2014 and with the smartest recruitment and management possible.\n\nThey have renewed both stadium and team. They have shown what can be achieved. Most United fans would conclude that the current executive regime of Woodward and his head of corporate development, Matt Judge, have had their time.\n\nYet there is a calmness at Old Trafford right now. It would be wrong to characterise that as complacency as there is deep disappointment at results. The club also realise that, because commercial income has held good despite the decline on the pitch, a perception has emerged that money matters more than medals. They would emphatically say otherwise. They want the commercial income to drive football success.\n\nUnder Louis van Gaal there was an obvious plan to spend big on some of the biggest names\n\nHowever, that philosophy changed when United chose not to sign Jerome Boateng in 2018\n\nTheir confidence is more rooted in the fact that the executives genuinely believe they have changed course and reset the club. The \u2018No\u2019 to Boateng was an early indicator of that change.\n\nThis summer\u2019s transfer window, bringing in Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James, is a sign of a more joined-up strategy. The departures of Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez, the latter albeit only on loan, a necessary break with the past, even if there is a short-term cost.\n\nThe genesis of all of this is, as with most things at United, bound up with Ferguson\u2019s colossal influence. It is well-documented that the club were ill-prepared for his retirement. Some at Old Trafford speak of it being sprung on them, though, given that he was 71 at the time, it shouldn\u2019t have come as huge surprise.\n\nThat the board were still too in awe of his advice initially in appointing David Moyes as successor was perhaps forgiveable: the combination of Ferguson\u2019s genius and forcefulness would have made it hard to resist, though, in hindsight, they should have done.\n\nWhile United were underperforming, Liverpool were slowly building under Jurgen Klopp\n\nYet it was what happened next which set United on the path to an expensive decline. At the heart of the club are three of the Glazer brothers, Avram, Joel and Bryan, with Woodward as their representative in the UK. All they had known was Ferguson, so a strong manager was their model.\n\nYet all around them football was changing. Ian Graham, Liverpool\u2019s director of research, who has a PhD in theoretical physics from Cambridge University, was rebuilding the club\u2019s recruitment with postgraduates from Massachusetts Institute of Technology; by contrast it was as though all the data United had was in Ferguson\u2019s head and went out the door the moment he retired.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t entirely true as United did have a rudimentary software analysis tool when Ferguson was manager. But it was clunky and old-fashioned, even if fitted the needs of the manager.\n\nAfter all, as staff fondly recall, Ferguson\u2019s reach within world football meant that if he wanted to sign someone he could simply pick up the phone of that player\u2019s current manager to get the full lowdown. Usually, the opposition were so in thrall to Ferguson that they would tell the truth.\n\nThe shift in power was best shown last season when Liverpool won the Champions League\n\nYet Woodward is said to have realised by 2014, halfway through Moyes\u2019 first season, that sticking to the old model wasn\u2019t going to work. He began to take soundings around the world, to analyse how they could best replicate what Ferguson had held in his head.\n\nYet when Van Gaal was appointed the club hadn\u2019t made sufficient headway into setting up the new structure. Marcel Bout came in alongside his compatriot and was well-regarded enough as a scout to survive Van Gaal\u2019s departure and be installed as United\u2019s head of global scouting. But the manager still remained the dominant figure in that time.\n\nThere is an acceptance at the club that mistakes have been made in recruitment but especially in that era: Angel Di Maria at \u00a359.7m, Morgan Schneiderlin at \u00a331m, Memphis Depay at \u00a325m, Matteo Darmian at \u00a313m, Bastian Schweinsteiger at \u00a36.5m and Radamel Falcao, an expensive loan, would be among them.\n\nWoodward can hardly pass the blame entirely to the manager. It was his job to control him. Yet United, still inclined to the cult of managerial authority, deferred to Van Gaal\u2019s wishes too much. They made too many exceptions to the model they were building.\n\nUnited are now changing their focus, and are looking to bring in young and hungry players\n\nFor, from 2014, United have been attempting to overhaul recruitment. It has been a long, slow build. Too long and too slow, you could argue. They might counter that theirs were unique circumstances and they were trying to build a system to replace Sir Alex\u2019s brain and charisma, which was pretty much impossible.\n\nBut by 2018 they had a team in place that allowed Woodward to be confident enough to say \u2018No\u2019 to Mourinho. Last summer, with Solksjaer on board and onside with the model, they felt it was fully operational.\n\nThey are confident that after their painstaking rebuild, the structure is as sophisticated as anyone\u2019s. Unheralded names such as Mick Court, a former Loughborough University don and analyst at Watford and Crewe, is the chief technical scout, crunching through data.\n\nHe has excelled in the new system. Mark Platt, who works with him, uses their own bespoke software to analyse the market. United, like most clubs also buy in packaged software such as Wyscout to add to their model. Yet, as Graham did at Liverpool, they now have designed their own package which they feel outperforms the standard ones.\n\nRecently club staff were presented with a presentation of how the recruitment procedure works. The idea was to communicate exactly how far United have come, so that the staff at least were clear that it wasn\u2019t Woodward picking out players to buy.\n\nEd Woodward has not been short of criticism throughout his tenure as United chief executive\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is capable of leading United to glory\n\nSo, before signing Wan-Bissaka, United had data on 804 right-backs around the world. At the start of the process, Solskjaer told the recruitment department what he was looking for. By drawing on the reports of 33 first-team scouts, they produced a list of 50-70 names. With further scouting reports and using their software, they then produced a top 10. The club then applied bespoke video analysis to narrow it to three candidates.\n\nThis is the recruitment department. In those final crucial meetings sit Jim Lawlor, who was Ferguson\u2019s chief scout, Bout, Court, Solskjaer and Judge. Woodward isn\u2019t present. It is said Judge doesn\u2019t offer any input on the quality of the players. His only role is as the initial interface with the agents.\n\nSo if a player is suggested, he say that he has met the agent and it\u2019s clear the player doesn\u2019t want to move to England; or that he has just signed a new long-term contract but has a buy-out clause which makes him a possible target.\n\nThe United boss has been under fire for a string of poor performances this season\n\nThere is a power of veto on either side to add checks and balance to the system and avoid the mistakes of the past. So, the recruitment department has the power to veto the manager if he wants to buy a player, as they did with Mourinho. They can only do so if they can prove that their analysis meant the player didn\u2019t make their top-three list. And the manager himself can veto a candidate put forward by the recruitment department.\n\nDespite the years of decline, United believe they now have a structure that will serve them well. And Solskjaer seems to be crucial within that. The club have been impressed with the impact he made.\n\nFrom the outside, it looked a rushed and romantic appointment. Internally, he has done so much to change the mood music of the club, that no-one would be looking to cut him loose so soon into this new era, whatever happens against Liverpool.\n\nSolskjaer, though, has to prove himself. The strategies that unpicked Spurs and Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League last season seem a distant memory. He has to pit his wits against the best coaches in the world in Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp. Nothing thus far in his career indicates that he will have anything like the career they have had.\n\nThe two bosses meet on Sunday in what is a huge game for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\n\nHe is United\u2019s man though. You would imagine the club will stick it out with him for the best part of this season and even beyond. Their intention would seem to be to let this new phase have a couple of seasons to play out.\n\nThe club is confident their financial might means that with smart recruiting they can challenge Liverpool within a few transfer windows. That\u2019s a bullish call. Many aren\u2019t yet convinced United are on the right track and, even if they are, that it would take at least three years and probably a new coach to turn them around.\n\nYet they have made their choice and the trajectory is set. It is clearly a very different club to the one Woodward inherited in 2013. And it is probably better resourced for football in the modern era. The management is well aware that they won\u2019t be deemed a success until they have won the Premier League. They question is just how long that will take. Right now, it seems some way off.", "description": "SPECIAL REPORT: It is well documented that Manchester United were not prepared for Sir Alex Ferguson's departure, but after six dismal years United are launching a modern operation.", "authors": ["Rob Draper For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/21/19935470-0-image-a-78_1571515464318.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
