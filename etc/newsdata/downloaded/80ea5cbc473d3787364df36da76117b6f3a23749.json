HOLY SHIT. He did it. The crazy sonofabitch actually did it. After some 728 quarters with a full bagel on the stat sheet, Ben Simmons \u2013 the boy, the absolute lad \u2013 hit a three.\n\nHe HIT A THREE.\n\nA no-fooling, actual, in-game, three point bucket. Clean as a whistle. Down it goes. Holy fucking hell.\n\nSimmons, quite infamously, has spent his entire burgeoning NBA career thus far absolutely scoreless from beyond the three-point arc, displaying the kind of violent physical aversion to even attempting three-point shots that your average allergist would shit themselves to study.\n\nBut the hype over the off-season has been all about Simmons\u2019 reported jump shot. Does he have one now? Does the lad from Fitzroy finally have the skills to start bombing them from long-range?\n\nWith seconds to go in the first half of today\u2019s pre-season clash between Philadelphia and Chinese side Guangzhou, we found out.\n\nHe fucken hit one, he actually goddamn did it, mother of god.\n\nBEN SIMMONS HIT A 3PT. pic.twitter.com/TEpomnW9Uy \u2014 Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) October 9, 2019\n\nIs it a pre-season game? Yes. Does that actually count on his official career stat sheet? Probably not. Does the Guangzhou defence more closely resemble a pile of half-melted witches hats? A bit. Was the score 82 \u2013 41 at half time? Sure.\n\nBut that\u2019s still Ben By-God Simmons hitting an in-game three point shot on an honest-to-goodness NBA court. Hell has frozen over, Simmons has a jump shot, halle-fucken-lujah.\n\nREAD MORE Ben Simmons Takes Aim At The Deadset Flogs Who Want Him Banished From Oz\n\nCheck out the Internet reaction, in all its caps-lock, mega-hyped majesty.\n\n????
