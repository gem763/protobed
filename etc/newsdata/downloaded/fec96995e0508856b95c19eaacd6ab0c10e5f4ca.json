Liverpool reported the issue after the MK Dons tie.\n\nThe EFL has suspended \u00a3100,000 of the fine.\n\nAn EFL Spokesman said: \u201cThe rules of the Carabao Cup require Clubs to ensure all players are registered and eligible in line with their respective League\u2019s rules before they play. The player was always contracted to Liverpool FC during this period, and the reason he was not eligible was because the club did not have the relevant international clearance following expiry of an earlier loan agreement. The club\u2019s breach was in part due to the challenges it encountered with securing the correct international clearance, and its subsequent ability to include the Player on teamsheets despite the lack of clearance.\n\n\u201cAs a result the Board concluded the most appropriate sanction was a financial penalty.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Liverpool responded: \u201cThe club accepts the judgement outcome and punishment imposed by the EFL. We believe it is proportionate with the technical indiscretion committed and will be making no further representations.\n\n\u201cEven though there were mitigating factors, which were beyond our control or jursdiction, we believe it appropriate we apologise to the competition\u2019s governing body and also to Milton Keynes Dons.\u201d", "description": "Liverpool have escaped disqualification from the Carabao Cup after being hit with a \u00a3200,000 fine for fielding an ineligible player in their third round victory over MK Dons.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RecYIRtH8UutmcdlibnG6A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XACLepR5N_Ou7CPBIQxk_A--~B/aD0xNTY0O3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/95b5547417d7edf86d92fe76faf11ce4"}
