Now, the space agency is moving further into the future, with the first all-electric experimental aircraft.\n\nThe plane, known as the X-57 Maxwell, was delivered to NASA\u2019s Armstrong Flight Research Center in California.\n\n\"The X-57 Mod II aircraft delivery to NASA is a significant event, marking the beginning of a new phase in this exciting electric X-plane project,\u201d said X-57 Project Manager Tom Rigney in a statement.\n\nNASA CHIEF SCIENTIST SAYS 'WE'RE CLOSE' TO MAKING ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT LIFE ON MARS\n\nRigney added that with the X-57 Mod now available to the space agency, NASA will start testing the integrated electric propulsion system to ensure the aircraft is airworthy. \"We plan to rapidly share valuable lessons learned along the way as we progress toward flight testing, helping to inform the growing electric aircraft market.\u201d\n\nThere are three configurations of the all-electric aircraft, the first of which is known as Modification II, or Mod II. NASA added that as the X-57 Mod II starts testing on the ground, plans for Mod III and Mod IV are already underway, including testing on the plane's high-aspect-ratio wing.\n\nThe X-57 Maxwell was delivered to NASA by ESAero, a San Luis Obispo, Calif.-based company.\n\nOne of the goals of the X-57 project is to \"help develop certification standards for emerging electric aircraft.\" The design of the plane will be shared with regulators and the aviation industry in an effort to further the advancement of the budding electric aircraft market.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM", "description": "NASA has been testing X-planes, experimental aircraft that it uses to test a variety of different technologies, for more than 70 years, including the Bell X-1, the first plane to break the sound barrier in flight.
