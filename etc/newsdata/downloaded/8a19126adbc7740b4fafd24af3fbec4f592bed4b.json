We will bend over backwards to look after people who have serious dietary requirements.\n\n'One of our struggles is gluten-free. Over 60 per cent of our menu can be made vegan, which is one of the trendiest things now, we can cater to that.\n\n'We can't always cater to gluten-free,' he told the NZ Herald.\n\n'We want to cater to authenticity. We will bend over backwards to look after people who have serious dietary requirements,' the business claimed\n\nThe Indian restaurant is widely considered one of the best in Auckland. The restaurateur now claims the line was included as a joke to see which of his customers have a sense of humour\n\n'The frustrating thing is we have people say 'we're coeliac, wheat will kill me' but we offer them a gluten-free beer option and they say 'no, beer doesn't count'. They take the piss.'\n\nSimilarly, Mr Akuthota said he's rushed to the aide of a customer before when he saw them put fried chicken in their mouth after they made a fuss about needing gluten-free options.\n\nBut he said in that instance, the customer again turned around and said 'it's okay it won't kill me'.\n\n'The hipster allergy was really put on there as a joke. We've never charged that and we never will.\n\n'It's more a case of saying if you're going to be hipster and trendy by being vegan or gluten-free please tell us how serious it is. If it is going to be life-threatening, we will do our best to look after you.'", "description": "Satya Chai Lounge owner Samrudh Akuthota claims he frequently gets customers in his Auckland store that claim to be coeliac but will happily drink gluten-rich beers.", "authors": ["Brittany Chain For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/04/19721566-0-image-a-132_1571111622705.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
