But don't let the villa's single-story exterior fool you.\n\nExterior view of the modest looking single-story villa \"Hacienda de la paz\" CNBC\n\nThis massive homes spans 51,000 square feet, much of which falls below ground. It took the original owner, food magnate John Blazevich, almost two decades to build the nine-bedroom, 25-bath residence. Community rules restricted him from building above the first level , so he built down...way down. And if you know where to find it, there's a secret passageway that leads to a mind-blowing subterranean lair more than 20 feet below ground-level.\n\nCNBC's Robert Frank and Alex McLeod walk down the hidden staircase to the home's lower levels.

The space includes an underground lounge and bar, as you might guess it's stocked with tequila. Next to the bar is where Brown, who is also a race car driver, parked his Ferrari 458 and Le Mans prototype race car. He's also put a racing simulator and giant TV down here.\n\nUnderground bar with Brown's race car parked along side it.
