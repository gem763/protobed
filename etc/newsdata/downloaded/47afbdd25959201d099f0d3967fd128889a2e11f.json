Ltd.'s (005380.SE) third-quarter net profit increased sharply on year, helped by solid sales growth in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nNet profit for the quarter ended September was 460.50 billion Korean won ($393.4 million) compared with KRW305.95 billion in the same quarter a year earlier, the South Korean car maker said Thursday.\n\nThe result missed consensus forecasts for KRW811.27 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nRevenue climbed 10% on year to KRW26.969 trillion.\n\nOperating profit rose 31% on year to KRW378.52 billion.\n\nHyundai Motor said brisk sales of its new sports-utility vehicles in the U.S. and Europe helped boost revenue and earnings while demand from China remained weak.\n\nThe one-off legal costs for its class-action settlement over engine defects ate into the company's net profit, it said.\n\nWrite to Kwanwoo Jun at kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 02:44 ET (06:44 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
