So they didn\u2019t head to a fancy luxury hotel, but rather to one of Shibuya\u2019s back-alley love hotels, which rent rooms by the hour to amorous couples. But as the pair entered their room, things suddenly got very crowded as a group of four teen boys also forced their way inside what the man had thought was going to be a space for two.\n\nHowever, the boys weren\u2019t a band of chivalrous guardian angels out to save the young lady from selling her body and self-respect. Instead, they were her accomplices, and they quickly launched into the extortion scheme they had planned out before the girl asked the man to take her to a hotel. \u201cYou\u2019re finished, dude!\u201d they told the man. \u201cWe\u2019ve got pictures of you!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether or not the man agreed to purchase their silence, and if so how much it cost him. However, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police have now put an end to the operation and arrested the five teens. The group admitted that the girl went out as bait with the boys waiting nearby and tailing the target to the hotel, where they\u2019d then force him to pay up if he didn\u2019t want his underage prostitution attempt exposed. Reports refer to the teen boys, who are about 17 years old, as being \u201cunemployed,\u201d implying that they\u2019re not enrolled in school (Japanese compulsory education stops after the ninth grade).\n\nAlso unclear is whether or not the man himself is facing any charges, as outright prostitution in banned in Japan, as are erotic services performed by a 16-year-old, though ostensibly, he could be claiming ignorance of the girl\u2019s age at the time and denying that the 15,000 yen was meant as a gift, not for services rendered.\n\nSources: TV Asahi via Hachima Kiko, Nitele News 24, ANN News\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Japanese man arrested for pimping out partner to over 150 men\n\n-- Fake yakuza arrested in Tokyo after threatening man who was walking while staring at a smartphone\n\n-- Asia\u2019s most notorious gangs: an ever-present power\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/14/fake-schoolgirl-prostitution-extortion-ring-busted-by-tokyo-police/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "In August, a 30-something office worker was in Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya neighborhood when a 16-year-old first-year high school student made him an offer. \u201cLet\u2019s go to a hotel,\u201d she said to the man, who\u2019d never met her before, following up the solicitous offer by saying \u201cI want 15,000 yen.\u201d That seemed like an attractive price to\u2026", "authors": ["Burning Bush", "Chip Star"], "top_image": "https://japantoday.com/images/japan-today-social.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
