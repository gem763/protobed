It said the person had heard from White House officials that Trump had made statements on the call that the whistleblower viewed \u201cas seeking to pressure (Zelenskiy) to take an official action to help the president\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign.\u201d\n\nIn a summary of the call released by the White House on Wednesday, Trump pressed Zelinskiy to investigate unsubstantiated allegations that Biden, as vice president, pressured the government to fire a prosecutor who was probing a Ukrainian gas company, on whose board Biden\u2019s son Hunter served.\n\nThe intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, Michael Atkinson, was concerned that Trump\u2019s request violated U.S. campaign laws that prohibit any kind of foreign support to an election candidate, the Justice Department opinion said.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky during a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York City, New York, U.S., September 25, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nAtkinson, who was appointed by Trump, was also worried that \u201cthe alleged misconduct by a senior U.S. official to seek foreign assistance to interfere in or influence a federal election could potentially expose the official to serious national security and counter-intelligence risks,\u201d said the opinion.\n\nAtkinson said that while there were indications of political bias on the part of the whistleblower, he concluded that the allegations appeared credible, the opinion said.\n\nThe opinion was written by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel in support of acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire\u2019s refusal to send the whistleblower complaint to the U.S. Congress. Maguire argued that he did not have jurisdiction over the subject of the complaint.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump potentially exposed himself to \"serious national security and counter-intelligence risks\" when he pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate a leading political rival, Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden, and his son, the intelligence community's inspector general warned.", "authors": ["Jonathan Landay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433887943&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O1QU", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
