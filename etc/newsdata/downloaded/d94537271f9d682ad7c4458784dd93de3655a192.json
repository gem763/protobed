Then a hero intervenes.", "language": "en", "text": "The hulking, seemingly unmanned golf cart was doing furious, breakneck doughnuts on the airport tarmac when a yellow-vested worker sprang into action.\n\nWhat he did next won him applause from a terminal full of bleary-eyed travelers who had stopped to stare out the window at the bizarre battle royal playing out among rows of parked airplanes.\n\nThe dramatic scene unfolded Monday at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International, one of the country\u2019s busiest airports, and footage of the episode rocketed across social media that evening. Four hours after Kevin Klauer, chief executive of the American Osteopathic Association, posted the video to Twitter, it had racked up more than 1 million views. The worker in the vest was dubbed a savior.\n\nCrazy event at ORD. Heads up safety move by a ramp worker! pic.twitter.com/SQi5zB0Ooz \u2014 Kevin Klauer DO, EJD (@Emergidoc) September 30, 2019\n\nWhat actually happened remains unclear. Karen Pride, the Chicago Department of Aviation\u2019s spokeswoman, referred questions about the incident to American Airlines, which owns the equipment and employs the workers involved.\n\nThe airline\u2019s media relations department emailed a statement that said the company is \u201cinvestigating an incident involving a catering truck.\u201d\n\n\u201cPreliminary reports indicate that the accelerator became stuck and caused the catering cart to lose control,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cNo American Airlines team members were injured and the incident resulted in one 10 minute flight delay.\u201d\n\nOne more thing is obvious: Were it not for one fast-acting employee, the runaway oversized cart may have hurtled into a plane parked at a gate.\n\nAs the vehicle spun wildly, apparently knocking one worker to the ground, others dodged and ran for cover. Some stood and looked around, seemingly unsure of what to do. The cart swerved and its wheels smashed what appeared to be soda cans, sending their contents spraying.\n\nIn the terminal, passengers gasped.\n\n\u201cDid she get hit?!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my God.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is going on??\u201d\n\nOne worker, vest billowing about them, scampered off-screen, narrowly avoiding a broadside from one of the cart\u2019s swinging metal doors.\n\n\u201cGonna hit the airplane \u2014 here it goes,\u201d one spectator said.\n\nNot so fast.\n\nFrom stage right, the yellow-vested worker reappears in the video, at the helm of another airport ground support vehicle. Just in time, the worker dutifully rams the side of the wayward cart, toppling it over and sending its contents spilling over the tarmac \u2014 but sparing the airplane and their co-workers.\n\nAgain, a chorus from the terminal.\n\n\u201cOh, nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere ya go!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how you do it!\u201d\n\nThe crowd clapped its approval.\n\nIn its statement, American Airlines added, \u201cWe appreciate the quick action of our team member who stopped the vehicle.\u201d\n\nOnline, the fracas and the worker\u2019s actions were received with equal parts confusion and adulation.\n\n\u201cTHIS IS INSANE,\u201d one person wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cHoly Cow! This has won the Internet for today,\u201d said another.\n\nThe plane enthusiast website NYCAviation tweeted the understated shout-out, \u201cCreative solution to a rather unusual problem.\u201d And the website Deadspin awarded the clip its \u201cSports Highlight of the Day.\u201d\n\nOne commenter summed it up simply: \u201cWe all need heroes.\u201d", "description": "The dramatic scene unfolded at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International on Monday.", "authors": ["Reis Thebault", "National", "Breaking News Reporter", "September At Pm", "Reis Thebault Is A Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News.
