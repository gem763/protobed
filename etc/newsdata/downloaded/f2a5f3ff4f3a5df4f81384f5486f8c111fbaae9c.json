While it won\u2019t replace my normal pourover or a larger coffee machine, it\u2019s a clever, quick and portable way to make a cup.\n\nDesigner Eduardo Uma\u00f1a pitched me the device a little more than a year ago, and I was taken by the possibility of vacuum brewing \u2014 and the fact that, amazingly, until now no one from Colombia had made a coffee maker (it\u2019s named after Frank de Paula Santander, who kicked off the coffee trade there). But would the thing actually work?\n\nIn a word, yes. I\u2019ve tested the FrankOne a few times in my home, and, while I have a couple reservations, it\u2019s a coffee making device that I can see myself actually using in a number of circumstances.\n\nThe device works quite simply. Ground coffee goes in the top, and then you pour in the hot (not boiling!) water and stir it a bit \u2014 30-50 seconds later, depending on how you like it, you hit the button and a pump draws the liquid down through a mesh filter and into the carafe below. It\u2019s quick and almost impossible to mess up.\n\nThe resulting coffee is good \u2014 a little bit light, I\u2019d say, but you can adjust the body with the size of the grounds and the steeping time. I tend to find a small amount of sediment at the bottom, but less than you\u2019d get in a cup of French press.\n\nBecause it\u2019s battery powered (it should last for ~200 cups and is easily recharged) and totally waterproof, cleaning it is a snap, especially if you have a garbage disposal. Just dump it and rinse it, give it a quick wipe and it\u2019s good to go. It gets a bit more fussy if you don\u2019t have a disposal, but what doesn\u2019t?\n\nI can see this being a nice way to quickly and simply make coffee while camping \u2014 I usually do a French press, but sometimes drip, and both have their qualities and limitations. The FrankOne would be for making a single cup when I don\u2019t want to have to stand by the pourover cone or deal with disassembling the French press for cleaning.\n\nIt\u2019s also, I am told by Uma\u00f1a, great for cold brew. I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him that I don\u2019t really like cold brew, but I know many do, and Uma\u00f1a promises the FrankOne works wonders in a very short time \u2014 four minutes rather than an hour. I haven\u2019t tested that, because cold brew tastes like bitter chocolate milk to me, but I sincerely doubt he would mention it as many times as he did if it didn\u2019t do what he said.\n\nThere are, I feel, three downsides. First, you\u2019re pretty much stuck with using the included glass carafe, because the device has to create a seal around the edge with its silicone ring. It didn\u2019t fit in my biggest mug, but you might find an alternative should the carafe (which I have no complaints about \u2014 it\u2019s attractive and sturdy) crack or get lost.\n\nSecond, it doesn\u2019t produce a lot of coffee. The top line as indicated in the reservoir is probably about 10-12 ounces \u2014 about the size of a \u201ctall\u201d at a coffee shop. Usually that\u2019s a perfect amount for me, but it definitely means this is a single-serving device, not for making a pot to share.\n\nAnd third, for the amount of coffee it produces, I feel like it uses a lot of grounds. Not a crazy amount, but maybe 1.5-2x what goes into my little Kalita dripper \u2014 which is admittedly pretty economical. But it\u2019s just something to be aware of. Maybe I\u2019m using too much, though.\n\nI reviewed the Geesaa a little while back, and while it\u2019s a cool device, it was really complex and takes up a lot of space. If I wanted to give it to a friend I\u2019d have to make them download the app, teach them about what I\u2019d learned worked best, share my \u201crecipes\u201d and so on. There was basically a whole social network attached to that thing.\n\nThis is much, much easier to use \u2014 and compact, to boot. It\u2019s a good alternative to classic methods that doesn\u2019t try to be more than a coffee maker. At $120 it\u2019s a bit expensive, but hey, maybe you spend that on coffee in a month.\n\nAnd by the way, you can use the discount code \u201cTC\u201d at checkout to get 10% off \u2014 this isn\u2019t a paid post or anything, Uma\u00f1a\u2019s just a nice guy!", "description": "The FrankOne coffee maker, fresh off a successful crowdfunding campaign, is now available for purchase, and I got a chance to test out one of the first run of these funky little gadgets.
