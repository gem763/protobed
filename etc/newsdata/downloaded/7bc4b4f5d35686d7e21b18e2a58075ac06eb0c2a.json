There, she says, the village is the key. And if that means another woman breast-feeds your baby? There\u2019s a beautiful reason for that.\n\nThe Kraho people believe a child should have more than one mother. It\u2019s so ingrained in the culture that the Kraho children use the word \u201cinxe\u201d for both their biological mother and their mother\u2019s sisters or the women their mother considers as sisters, even if they\u2019re not related by blood. In fact, there is no word for aunt. To the children, they are all mothers.\n\nIn indigenous cultures, women have a central role when raising children, even though indigenous motherhood is a broad concept, as one ethnic group can be very distinct from another. In Brazil, there are 305 ethnic groups that speak 274 languages, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics.\n\nMessora first visited Pedra Branca in 2009. She has been here so often that the Kraho have given her and her husband their own Kraho names. She always stays at the house of what became her Kraho family, although the concept of house is different from the one she is used to.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the complete opposite of what we learn in a western civilization. At the village there is an expansion of the core family, it\u2019s not just about the mother, the father and the children. There are between 15 to 20 people in a house. Each house has more than one mother, the children are raised by everyone, the 4-year-olds take care of the 3-year-olds who take care of the 2-year-olds,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhen a couple marries, the man moves into the woman\u2019s house. All mothers stay together, there is a network of daughters, they breast-feed the children of their close relatives, my daughter Mira is breast-fed by other women in our house.\u201d\n\nBruna Franchetto, a professor at the Department of Linguistics and the Department of Anthropology at the National Museum in Rio de Janeiro, says she believes her time studying and working in indigenous villages in Brazil might have influenced the way she raised her own son.\n\n\u201cI learned how to share my son with other women figures,\u201d said Franchetto. \u201cThe big difference between raising a child in the city and raising a child in an indigenous village is that the children [in the village] go through this intensive process of socialization, but at the same time they have a scary amount of freedom. In the city, we are surrounded by walls, cars, traffic. The child has a small social circle and has to overcome a lot of barriers to be able to enjoy an open space.\u201d\n\nRegardless of culture, there are different approaches to parenting. And there are as many ways to be a mother as there are mothers. French toddlers are expected to eat the same meals as their parents, Spanish kids stay up as late as they wish, Icelandic babies nap outside in subzero temperatures.\n\nIndigenous children are raised to develop high autonomy from a young age, a valuable skill in adulthood. That allows them to be surprisingly agile and strong, and to be familiar with their surroundings.\n\n\u201cWhen I get back to the village, I feel a big difference,\" Messora said. \u201cMira has a more autonomous life, she is not always holding onto her father and I.\u201d\n\nAna Gabriela Morim Lima, a post-doctorate in anthropology at the University of Sao Paulo, points out that all children learn by playing and imitating their siblings and parents. The Kraho are no different.\n\n\u201cThey believe that for someone to learn something, they need to \u2018know how to see\u2019 and \u2018know how to listen,\u2019 \u2018to open their ears and their eyes.\u2019 Only then you can learn the songs, how to move in the forest, how to identify the sounds of the birds and other animals, or how to follow their tracks,\u201d said Lima. \u201cTo the Kraho and other indigenous people, learning depends on a corporal and sensorial engagement with the world.\u201d\n\nThis close relationship to nature from an early age can make it hard for the Kraho to leave their village. Messora and her husband were at Cannes, where their film was awarded the jury special prize, with indigenous actors from the movie. Then last February, the movie was presented at Lincoln Center in New York, but the actors didn\u2019t come. They don\u2019t like to stay away from their village for long periods of time.\n\nThe actress who once breast-fed their baby, Raene K\u00f4t\u00f4 Krah\u00f4, \"thought everything in the big cities was very weird. She thought our apartment was always very empty, that people are away from each other and that there are a lot of people around but everyone is alone,\u201d said Messora. \u201cIn the big city, we\u2019re all alone in closed spaces.\u201d\n\nThe indigenous actors were also disturbed to see homeless people sleeping in the streets.\n\n\u201cThe Kraho share what they own with others, they believe things have to circulate. Detachment when it comes to things you own is a hard concept for us westerners to grasp, as we\u2019ve been through centuries and centuries of private property,\u201d said Franchetto.\n\nMessora told the story of a friend who lives in Pedra Branca who took his family to the city to see his parents outside of the village. There, his son got presents from his grandparents. As the family returned to the Kraho village, his son happily gave all his presents away to his friends.\n\nKraho tradition dictates that childbirth should be at home, where women in the family take part in each others\u2019 delivery. That creates a connection between the ancestors and the newborn, and the baby is welcomed by everyone the mother trusts. One of the most common positions to deliver a baby is to have the woman crouching on the legs of another woman who is holding her. Children are born as they fall right into their grandmother\u2019s hands.\n\nEven though indigenous mothers are advised to give birth at a hospital, some Kraho women still hold on to tradition. The nearest hospital is about 200 miles away from this village. If women chose to go, they pick someone to go with them who can help deliver the baby.\n\nMessora and her husband want to go back to the village and raise their daughter there while they work on the production of an upcoming movie, also with the Kraho.\n\nThere are other mothers raising children in between cultures. Maira Pedroso, a 33-year-old mother of two from Sao Paulo, has been living with the Kraho for eight years. Once, her Kraho friend came to visit and brought along her 2-year-old daughter. The friend had come to do traditional body painting on Pedroso\u2019s 6-month-old son. Everything was going well until the visitor\u2019s little girl started screaming.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when my Kraho friend taught me a beautiful lesson. \u2026 She calmly directed her daughter to paint just her arm and her daughter got quiet and allowed her mother to finish the work,\u201d said Pedroso. \u201cFor us non-indigenous mothers, to offer a sense of freedom and a nonviolent education is a challenge that a lot of times requires us to go through a reeducation.\u201d\n\nMessora has observed the same trait.\n\n\u201cI have never seen a Kraho mother yell at a child. They do tell them they\u2019re wrong, but they never yell. Education is a collective endeavor the whole village takes part of,\u201d said Messora.\n\nThere are also Kraho mothers living in the city who try to preserve their culture. M\u00e1rcia Krah\u00f4, 21, has been living in Carolina, in the state of Maranhao in Brazil, for 10 years. Since she became a mother, she wants to spend more time in her village because of her son.\n\n\u201cI want my son to live between the village and the city, I want him to grow close to nature and to our family. In the city we feel a bit isolated,\u201d said M\u00e1rcia, whose son is 8 months old. \u201cI want to teach my son what I\u2019ve been taught when I was a little girl. My friends and I used to have so much fun, we would bathe in the river, climb trees, run in the forest, we had a lot of freedom.\u201d\n\nFor now, Messora and Salaviza are considering their options for where and how to raise their daughter.\n\n\u201cWe think about our lives, we think about how we want to spend our time, where do we want to be,\" Messora says. \u201cI want my daughter to be happy and I\u2019ve never seen anyone as happy as a Kraho child. In a city, I don\u2019t see that this kind of freedom and this connection to nature, can be possible. \u2026 I want Mira to learn from them. I want her to know there are other things in the world apart from cellphones and tablets, many children are wasting their childhood with those devices and I don\u2019t want that to happen to my daughter.\u201d\n\nSofia Perp\u00e9tua is a freelance journalist and video producer based in Rio de Janeiro.
