His hiring is part of a plan by The Information to double its business team to more than 14 over the next 12 months.\n\nLessin said she sees Bowlby \u2014 who was the ad-sales director at Spotify and also had sales roles at Flipboard, The New York Times, and Time Inc. before that \u2014 as accelerating a business that's already been growing at nearly 40% a year.\n\nRead more: Business-news outlet Quartz has lost 5 key people in the past few months\n\nNinety percent of The Information's revenue comes from subscribers that typically pay $400 a year, and Lessin has rejected the traditional digital-advertising model, saying it devalues journalism. But The Information has sold different kinds of event sponsorships to more than 50 brands, including Accenture, Goldman Sachs, and Johnson & Johnson, and it's looking for other ways to let companies access its audience, through not just events but also its newsletters, videos, and podcasts.\n\nThe Information's audience: young and successful\n\nLessin said the subscribers number in the \"low tens of thousands.\" She shared new information about the audience: Half are executives younger than 34, and 18% are CEOs. One-third work at companies with more than 10,000 people.\n\n\"The high-level view is, brands are trying to reach our audience in lots of different ways,\" she said. \"We're working with them on things beyond just a logo on stage. There's a tremendous amount of runway because there's a tremendous amount of businesses that want to deepen their connection with the Silicon Valley community. It's all about finding opportunities that supplement the subscription business.\"\n\nThe company also hired Erica Grijalva as vice president of enterprise sales to sell group subscriptions to companies. It's tapping ex-BuzzFeed exec Ashley McCollum as a consultant on new business opportunities and looking for a vice president of marketing and head of subscription business.\n\nThe Information wants to take a page from BuzzFeed\n\nMcCollum was one of BuzzFeed's longest serving employees and rose to general manager of its hugely popular food brand, Tasty, which spawned a line of cookbooks and cookware sold at Walmart. That experience might seem at odds with The Information's tight focus on business journalism, but Lessin said she sees McCollum helping the publication look for new ways to get involved with companies and develop new franchises.\n\n\"Having built Tasty, she has a great understanding of how publications can work with brands,\" Lessin said.\n\nWhile other digital-media companies have raised venture capital and, in some cases, have struggled to meet investors' lofty growth expectations, Lessin bootstrapped The Information and said it broke even 2 1/2 years after it started in 2013.\n\nA lot of news publications have tried to pivot to subscriptions to supplement ad revenue, but few have developed meaningful businesses that way. The hiring of an advertising exec might signal to some that after five years, The Information's core subscription business is slowing down.\n\nLessin has never said exactly how many subscribers The Information has but said the opposite is true.\n\n\"It's accelerating,\" she said. \"Our subscription business is 90% of our revenue and will always be the vast majority of our revenue, but the community we built is very strong, and there are a lot of opportunities to partner with brands.\"", "description": "The tech-news publication has shunned traditional ads but sees a big opportunity to connect companies with its young executive readership.", "authors": ["Lucia Moses"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6eb9792e22af180c49286c-1136-568.jpg"}
