Her sister, Kirsty, is also now pregnant.\n\nReleasing Kylie from jail yesterday, Mr Justice Goose also said she does not pose a 'risk or danger' to the public and said she has a 'realistic' prospect of rehabilitation.\n\nIn September Southampton Crown Court heard the sisters, all from the city, attacked Miss Yorke after Kirsty and her partner Stuart House attempted to get in to the party but were denied access.\n\nThe incident happened outside the Ice House in Southampton.
