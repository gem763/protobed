However, there is a rich world of \u201clyrical theology\u201d in a range of styles and approaches, with production value that rivals the big-money beatmakers. West\u2019s heartfelt and, thankfully, concise first entry is a welcome addition to this body of work, but if you\u2019re craving something more, you have a lot of material to choose from.\n\nSo here we have, presented in reverse chronological order, a small sample of Christian hip-hop (CHH) labels and artists who are expressing their faith while transcending the hokeyness that often plagues the Christian pop industry:\n\nHazakim \u2014 Origins (Wrath & Grace)\n\nI\u2019m the type of person who sees the Bible come alive through apologetics, so Hazakim (Hebrew for \u201cStrong Ones\u201d) has become one of my favorite artists. These Messianic Jewish brothers have put out \u201chip-hologetics\u201d records since 2001, often taking heat for their opposition to social justice co-opting the faith. Their most famous album, the sophomore LP Theophanies, centered on objections to Jesus from Muslims and orthodox Jews, and their latest project Origins similarly tackles the creation-evolution debate. And yet it\u2019s nothing like the dorky lecture you\u2019d assume; Origins is less about deconstructing a materialist worldview than inviting listeners into wonder at the elegance of God\u2019s engineering, often taking detours into theology revealed by nature. The album isn\u2019t an insecure rationalization, it\u2019s an expression of triumph \u2014 impeccably timed with the release of Michael Behe\u2019s third book, Darwin Devolves, and the academic community\u2019s growing realization that the theory\u2019s challenges are insurmountable \u2014 and a thesis that, until now, hasn\u2019t really had a worthy artistic translation. A bonus tease for Breitbart fans: keep an ear open for samples of Ben Carson and Andrew Klavan.\n\nFor further listening: Curt Kennedy \u2014 The Appendix, Result \u2014 The Elementology\n\nBeautiful Eulogy \u2014 Worthy (Humble Beast)\n\nRap? As worship music? There\u2019s no way, right? Well, tell it to these boys from Portland \u2014 Bryan \u201cBraille\u201d Winchester, Thomas \u201cOdd Thomas\u201d Terry, and producer Courtland Urbano \u2014 who achieved just that in their 2017 masterwork Worthy. These songs are downright liturgical, shifting from adoration to confession to thanksgiving to supplication back to a whole, whole lot of adoration. Urbano\u2019s use of analog instruments (string bass, upright piano\u2026 that pipe organ sounds pretty real, but I could be wrong) makes the soundscape both celestial and accessible, and the singalong choruses bookend verses full of powerful couplets I\u2019ve found myself incorporating into prayers. You may find the promotional materials of the Humble Beast label to be a little too artsy-fartsy, but the music itself hits the mark perfectly, and there\u2019s no greater example of its quality than Worthy.\n\nFor further listening: Alert312 \u2014 Joy King Supreme, Jackie Hill Perry \u2014 The Art of Joy\n\nSareem Poems & Terem \u2014 A Pond Apart (Illect)\n\nSareem Poems, a veteran of the group L.A. Symphony, is one of the best-kept secrets in this subgenre, blessed with an irresistible baritone voice and a compulsion for drastic genre hops on each new album. As his name implies, Sareem seems to relish the role of poet more than MC and shares top billing with his producers. From the jazzy funk of this year\u2019s 88 to Now to the electronica of 2018\u2019s Mind Over Matter and the soul sample smorgasbord of 2017\u2019s A Pond Apart, this prolific artist is always striving to make high art and letting his collaborators pursue their most experimental impulses rather than just imitate what\u2019s trendy.\n\nFor further listening: Rel McCoy \u2014 A Different Crown, Sivion \u2014 Dark Side of the Cocoon\n\nBizzle \u2014 Light Work (God Over Money)\n\nBut hey, you can sound like what\u2019s popular while giving glory to God! Bizzle is the founder of God Over Money, a record label that leans into the 2010s\u2019 catchy, hi-fi mumble rap style that could sneak into rotation at the club \u2014 but not to fit in with its meaningless, drug-glorifying culture. Bizzle has always been known for confronting famous rappers \u2014 Jay Z, Macklemore, and most recently Joyner Lucas \u2014 and calling on them to repent. God Over Money is about getting a seat at the table by speaking the lingua franca \u2014 then get some lost toes tapping while challenging the values of that culture.\n\nFor further listening: Jered Sanders \u2014 Hurry Up & Wait, Selah the Corner \u2014 Hoodie Season 3\n\nEshon Burgundy \u2014 The Passover (NFTRY)\n\nTake the lyricism of Sareem Poems and crank up the theology tenfold, and you\u2019ve got Eshon Burgundy \u2014 a Philadelphia rapper who likely could have gone on to some level of mainstream success, seeing as he caught the attention of producers like Jazzy Jeff before he fully committed to performing for Christ instead of being \u201csubliminal,\u201d a criticism he often throws at his contemporaries. Eshon just released For the Love of Money, a thrilling if overstuffed manifesto declaring his resolve to lift up Jesus\u2019 name and \u201cnever fold\u201d for wealth \u2014 but 2016\u2019s The Passover remains his quintessential work. \u201cMy past over, I\u2019m passed over,\u201d he marvels in the virtually percussion-less \u201cIntro,\u201d leading to nine more songs exploring the folly of his old life that led to him getting shot and nearly dying on the streets, thanking God for his new life, and walking in faith through this world\u2019s inescapable struggles.\n\nFor further listening: Jeremiah Bligen \u2014 Fighting Stance, IV Conerly \u2014 Don\u2019t Just Listen\n\nShai Linne \u2014 Lyrical Theology, Pt. 1: Theology (Lamp Mode)\n\nIn case you were wondering whether the Reformed/Calvinist wing of CHH takes its theology seriously, I present this LP from Philadelphia pastor Shai Linne, which works the word into its title \u2014 twice. While some of the songs skew a little too pedagogical (one is nominally and literally a \u201cTheology Q&A\u201d), Linne translates very deep concepts into simple language. Consider, for example, from \u201cThe Hypostatic Union,\u201d this brief but profound explanation of God\u2019s unified plurality revealed in the cross:\n\nOnly if you have the Holy Spirit\u2019s antennas\n\nCan you truly understand fallen man\u2019s dilemma\n\nSee, only a human can substitute for human lives\n\nBut only God can take the wrath of God and survive\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more systematic to chew on here: an exegesis of Psalm 110, a study (and praise) of the Holy Spirit, and the doctrine of regeneration seen in John 3 all hit the basics of the faith. And Shai tackles peripheral and controversial issues, too: spiritual warfare, predestination (dogmatically so), eschatology (more flexibly), and on his most famous track \u201cFal$e Teacher$,\u201d he not only denounces the prosperity gospel but names and shames its biggest proponents.\n\nFor further listening: Stephen the Levite \u2014 The Last Missionary, The Collective \u2014 The Collective\n\nZae da Blacksmith & DJ Average Joe \u2014 The Mosaic Mixtape (Christcentric)\n\nIn case you were wondering whether the Reformed/Calvinist wing of CHH takes hip-hop seriously, I present this LP from Jose Ca\u00f1as, aka Zae da Blacksmith, and DJ Average Joe. The Mosaic Mixtape is a crash course in the genre\u2019s history and conventions, as well as a satisfying offering of praise. Zae\u2019s gruff delivery over a stockpile of sublime crate-dug samples will get you hyped to look up the dozens of verse references he weaves into his lyrics, while Average Joe\u2019s record scratches of sermons and voicemails from many of the featured players tie provide engaging interludes and transitions between songs \u2014 a sort of Greek chorus driving the narrative forward. And there is a meta-narrative to the song order, exploring God\u2019s role as creator, his magnificence, and the greatness of the Holy Scriptures before heading into more practical concerns like marriage and singleness within the church, then a section of confession and praying for revival before an absolute tearjerker of an ending as Timothy Brindle joins Zae to thank God for the certainty He gives about forgiveness and belonging.\n\nFor further listening: Chrys Jones \u2014 Meno, Christcentric \u2014 The James Initiative\n\nLecrae \u2014 Rebel (Reach)\n\nBefore Kanye, the face of Christian rap was Lecrae, the biggest star to emerge from the \u201c116 Clique\u201d that also launched the careers of artists like Trip Lee, Sho Baraka, and Andy Mineo. Since 2012, he\u2019s fallen out of fashion in hardcore CHH circles for \u2014 well, not denying Christ, because he continues to affirm that he is a Christian \u2014 but for shying away from the label \u201cChristian rapper.\u201d Quite a few people noticed the difference when Kanye responded to a similar question: \u201cI\u2019m just a Christian everything.\u201d That contrast, plus some political disagreements, have made \u2018Crae anathema to some reformed hip-hop heads, but art can certainly transcend disagreements with the artist, and the man still has a strong catalog from before his crossover attempt. 2008\u2019s Rebel may sound a little dated to modern ears, but so does much of 2008\u2019s chart-topping trap music, even from the likes of Lil Wayne or T.I.\n\nFor further listening: KB \u2014 Today We Rebel, Tedashii \u2014 Below Paradise\n\nThe Cross Movement \u2014 House of Representatives (Cross Movement)\n\nThese are your favorite Christian rapper\u2019s favorite Christian rappers. They\u2019re not the first ones ever, but the Cross Movement\u2019s MCs were pioneers of serious lyrical theology, flawlessly marrying artistry and ministry, plus inspiring or mentoring most of the other performers on this list. Their two \u201990s albums hold up best, with these Philly boys shaped by the east-coast style of contemporaries like Nas and the Wu-Tang Clan. Moody, murky, slowed-down samples with those thick, slightly muffled kicks and hi-hats that sound like a real drum set. Thanks to hip-hop\u2019s cultural dominance in America, the lyrical slang hasn\u2019t aged poorly, and the timeless truth of the message makes Cross Movement both fresh and refreshing to the new listener.\n\nFor further listening: The Ambassador \u2014 Christology: In Laymen\u2019s Terms, Phanatik \u2014 The Incredible Walk", "description": "Here we have, presented in reverse chronological order, a small sample of Christian hip-hop labels and artists who, like Kanye West, are expressing their faith while transcending the hokeyness that often plagues the Christian pop industry.", "authors": ["Ezra Dulis"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-463023578-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
