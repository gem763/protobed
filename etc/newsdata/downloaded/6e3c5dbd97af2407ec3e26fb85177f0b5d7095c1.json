Our only focus is working towards Manchester City . That is where we must direct our entire energy, and this is what we owe to our fans\", along with the caption \"No more talking. No more messages.\"\n\nThe Saints now face two tricky games as they aim to bounce back from their humbling as they travel twice to Man City, first in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday and then in the Premier League on Saturday.\n\nThe result leaves Southampton in the relegation zone in 18th place on eight points and with a goal difference of -16.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nTheir captain Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg also apologised to fans after the Leicester match, saying: \"I can only put my head, as the captain, in front of the team, and say the only thing that matters now is what we do going forward.\n\n\"We can never, ever let something like this happen again. I don't want to talk- I can only apologise.\"", "description": "The 9-0 defeat on Friday night was the joint-biggest loss in Premier League history and the largest ever for a home side", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Reuters", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20739479.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Southampton-v-Leicester-City-Premier-League-St-Marys-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
