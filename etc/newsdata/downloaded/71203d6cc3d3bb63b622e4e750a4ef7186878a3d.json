There\u2019s even a gelatinous character named Jell-A who seems like tree sap sprung to life. Jell-A looks like what might happen if you gave children a stick of butter and told them to make action figures out of it.\n\nOctopath Traveller game review: Nintendo Switch exclusive is a beautiful homage to classic 16-bit JRPGs\n\nWe play as Kai, a teenage girl who travels into this Jim Henson-inspired world of slightly twisted yet whimsical oddities. \u201cIs it rude to comment on someone\u2019s fur?\u201d she wonders, as she lives separate from the mutated colony that has been shunted off from the rest of humanity and has never seen such wonders \u2014 or creepiness \u2014 before.\n\nMutazione is part of a small but burgeoning trend of games that shift away from post-apocalyptic violence and instead look for strands of hope in our climate crisis. Those who take a moment to invest the time in Mutazione \u2014 easy to do, thanks in part to a relaxed ambient soundtrack that intertwines itself with the sounds of nature \u2014 will find a game about nurturing the world, and learning to live in harmony with what we\u2019re given.\n\nHere, humans have evolved into other-worldly beings due to a climate-wrecking event, in this case a meteor crash \u2014 or a \u201cmoon dragon,\u201d as the residents of Mutazione have taken to calling it.\n\nVideo of Mutazione - Launch Trailer\n\nThis isn\u2019t the dystopian end-of-the-world narrative in which humanity has either doomed nature or nature has exacted revenge on our habitat-destroying ways. Mostly, it\u2019s simply a game about family and passing on traditions. Kai has gone to meet with and care for her dying grandfather, a scientist who jokes he\u2019s more of a shaman in his old age.\n\nThere\u2019s some mysticism here \u2014 see the aforementioned Jell-A \u2014 but Kai\u2019s grandfather, Nonno, isn\u2019t really a healer, per se; he\u2019s simply discovered that plants grow more readily when given proper care and company, and sometimes a song. Playing music to gardens is the puzzle, as it were, at the core of \u201cMutazione.\u201d These are prods to explore the colorful world and discover the plant seedlings that we too often overlook \u2014 or that earlier generations had bulldozed into roads (a library is full of never-eroding plastic mannequins and even a monorail, a mode of transportation that has no use in a world that\u2019s been twisted so it can only accommodate treehouses and caves).\n\nThe pace of Mutazione is slow at its most loving. Though the full experience is likely to take around 10 hours, the first real quest, so to speak, won\u2019t arrive until somewhere between 60 minutes and 90 minutes into the game. That\u2019s just about perfect since you\u2019ll want to spend some time simply exploring Mutazione\u2019s weird, lush and soap-opera-filled landscapes.\n\nAstral Chain game review: Nintendo Switch exclusive pushes the boundaries of what an action RPG can be\n\nThere are a couple of different ways to play. You can talk to everyone and learn the game\u2019s mysteries and discover inter-personal stories of unrequited crushes and unfulfilled dreams. Or you can rush through days gathering plant materials and playing music; various gardens require different songs, and bringing the world to life ultimately is what spreads happiness among its characters. It\u2019s best to find the time to accommodate both, as this is a game about growth, personal and environmental, and learning that they\u2019re all interconnected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware that might not sound immediately thrilling,\u201d Nonno tells Kai early in the game, of his plant-rearing theories.\n\nIt\u2019s meant for the player as much as her and serves as a self-referential ask on the part of the developers at Copenhagen-based Die Gute Fabrik to trust them. You should do so. While it shouldn\u2019t take tending to digital gardens to remind us of the thrill of tending to real ones, such a reminder should be celebrated in whatever medium it arrives.", "description": "While many video games find darkness in the end of the apocalypse, this adventure finds a ray of hope.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/bcfd2654-f62a-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6imagehires162209.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
