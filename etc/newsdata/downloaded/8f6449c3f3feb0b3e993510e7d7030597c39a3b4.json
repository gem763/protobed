Just a tremendous young man. And dies at the age of 58. That\u2019s not the way it\u2019s written up there. And I\u2019m 86 now and I\u2019m still flopping around like I am. I would have traded places, if someone would give me a chance.\u201d His voice broke.\n\nEven apart from Blake\u2019s death, Nordstrom has had a trying year, with sales down and dim prospects for retail depressing the company\u2019s stock. Erik said that, especially given the challenges, he still reflexively reaches for Blake\u2019s advice all the time.\n\n\u201cSomething will come up and I\u2019ll have this thought in my head like, \u2018Oh, Blake\u2019s better at that,\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019s Blake\u2019s strength\u2019 and then, \u2018Oh, I can\u2019t go there.\u2019 And the reason I can\u2019t go there is because he\u2019s not here. And the emotional part comes.\u201d\n\nBut as Peter and Erik mourn their brother\u2019s absence, they feel lucky to work in a place where so many people know who he was. Part of him is in the culture of Nordstrom, they say. In the New York store, casts of his footprints will be in two separate places, one looking out over the city and the other in the shoe department.\n\nPeter and Erik feel similarly about their own legacies, about likely being the last Nordstroms to run the company. Though Peter\u2019s children are young, he and Erik seem fairly sure that their successors will not be Nordstroms.\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s a different deal for our kids,\u201d Peter said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work to get from here to there.\u201d", "description": "One of the great family businesses faces the start-up age.", "authors": ["Jonah Engel Bromwich"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/fashion/23Nordstrom-family/23Nordstrom-family-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
