But a decade after the original phone came out, the 2017 edition of the iPhone, the iPhone X, became the first version to eschew the button in favor of swipe controls that require users to slide their fingers across the screen in various gestures.\n\nIt's not clear what prompted Trump to call out Apple's 58-year-old chief executive about the change now, more than two years after it was first implemented, and a White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. But the reality TV star turned politician has been vocal about smartphone design in the past.\n\nThroughout 2013 and 2014, Trump tweeted numerous times about his belief that Apple should introduce an iPhone with a larger screen \u2014 something the company ultimately did, starting with the iPhone 6 Plus.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.", "description": "The president of the United States has strong feelings about smartphone design and wants the world to hear them.", "authors": ["Rob Price"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db37c3bdee0194b7f6e7b45?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
