The company is also streamlining its operations and cutting costs as part of its restructuring program.\n\nBunge had initiated cost cuts in 2017 and expects to achieve run-rate savings of $250 million by the end of 2019.\n\nHowever, the company took a $1.7 billion charge related to its Brazilian sugarcane milling business.\n\nBunge and British energy company BP Plc had said in July they will merge their Brazilian sugar and ethanol operations to create the world's third-largest sugarcane processor. The company has tried to sell its sugar operation in Brazil in the past with no success.\n\nNet loss attributable to Bunge was $1.49 billion, or $10.57 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept.30, compared with a profit of $365 million, or $2.44 per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding items, the company earned $1.41 per share, beating analysts' expectation of 48 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data.\n\nThe White Plains, New York-based company said net sales fell 9.5% to $10.32 billion, missing analysts' estimate of $11.31 billion.
