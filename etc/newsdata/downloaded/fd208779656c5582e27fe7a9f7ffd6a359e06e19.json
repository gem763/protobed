Toxic algal blooms aren\u2019t high on many people\u2019s radar. Vacation-goers obliviously wade into ocean and lake waters that can cause gastrointestinal or respiratory problems. They eat contaminated fish and shellfish with potentially lethal consequences. Dog owners unknowingly allow their beloved pets to frolic in toxic ponds\u2014leading to death within hours.\n\n\n\nToxic algae is one of the quickest-spreading deadly effects of the climate crisis in the United States. As the Arctic\u2019s glaciers melt and the Amazon\u2019s rainforest burns, America\u2019s lakes, rivers, and coastlines are being increasingly infiltrated by several different types of brightly colored, toxic algae bacterium that thrive in warm, nutrient-rich conditions. A report released by the Environmental Working Group earlier this month found toxic algae appearing in more bodies of water, at higher quantities, and earlier in the summer than ever before. It also found that \u201cclimate change is making things worse, as scientists predict that warming waters coupled with fertilizer and manure washing off farm fields during heavier and more frequent rains may accelerate the frequency and intensity of harmful algal blooms in freshwater.\u201d\n\nWhile toxic algae blooms are supposed to be a regular occurrence in the summer, researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently forecasted that 2019 could bring some of the most abundant blooms in recent years. Toxic algae is no longer a minor inconvenience, disrupting diners\u2019 seafood menus for a few months. It\u2019s a neon threat on shores across the country, devastating individuals and communities, animals and people alike, as humanity belatedly struggles to respond. In states like New Jersey and Florida where algal blooms have already devastated both fishing and tourism economies, elaborate political fights\u2014some rife with conspiracy theory\u2014have broken out over how to manage the crises. And although 68 percent of Americans get their drinking water from lakes and rivers, algae toxins are not regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\nThese photos provide a glimpse of toxic algae\u2019s frightening spread across the United States in recent years.", "description": "Climate change is accelerating the spread of lethal algal blooms in American waterways\u2014with devastating results for humans and animals alike.", "authors": ["Emily Atkin", "Ben Depp"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/c6711a178bb4b0c9c71de95d4e2f3b9b61410d72.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
