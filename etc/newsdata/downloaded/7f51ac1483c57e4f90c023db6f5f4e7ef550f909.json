But Walton countered that at the time by saying the two sides were too far apart.\n\nCUPE is just one of the unions locked in talks with Doug Ford's Progressive Conservative government.\n\nSo far, none has been able to reach a deal, raising concern that a widespread school strike could happen this fall.\n\nMore to come", "description": "Some 55,000 education workers in Ontario are set to walk off the job Monday after their union said contract talks have stalled with seemingly little hope of reaching a deal.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5296401.1569414550!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/toronto-classroom-generic.jpg"}
