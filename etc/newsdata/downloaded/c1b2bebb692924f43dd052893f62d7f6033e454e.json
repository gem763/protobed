Biden had become the subject of ads placed by President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign making baseless claims regarding the Biden family\u2019s relationship with the Ukrainian government. Initially, all three companies rejected the idea of banning false political ads. Now, Twitter is banning all of them, true or false.\n\nThe top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 which has spent much of Trump\u2019s presidency investigating Russia\u2019s use of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter to interfere in the US\u2019s elections \u2014 suggested that Dorsey\u2019s decision was encouraging. \u201cGoing forward, and again, I hope that Zuckerberg and others may end up taking some guidance from what Dorsey and Twitter has done,\u201d Warner told NBC News.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who pressed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a hearing last week over the company\u2019s unwillingness to fact-check ads placed by politicians, called the move \u201ca good call.\u201d\n\n\u201cTechnology \u2014 and social media especially \u2014 has a powerful responsibility in preserving the integrity of our elections,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez continued. \u201cNot allowing for paid disinformation is one of the most basic, ethical decisions a company can make.\u201d\n\nTwitter\u2019s announcement came only a few hours before Facebook was scheduled to have its quarterly earnings call with investors. Throughout the call, Zuckerberg did not back down from his company\u2019s policy, saying \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for private companies to censor politicians or the news. Ads can be an important part of voice, especially for candidates and advocacy groups the media might not otherwise cover. It\u2019s hard to find where to draw the line.\u201d", "description": "Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are applauding Twitter\u2019s decision to ban political ads from its platform starting in November, seeing it as a welcome contrast to Facebook\u2019s hands-off approach to misleading ads.", "authors": ["Makena Kelly", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zshqQDyMxF87RmuIcD_Fstbga0s=/0x443:6192x3685/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19333022/1178400835.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
