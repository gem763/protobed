Eleven years after Major League Baseball\u2019s color barrier was broken, O\u2019Ree became known as the \u201cJackie Robinson of hockey,\u201d overcoming racism and cheap shots at hockey\u2019s highest levels as he kept a secret that could\u2019ve ended his career: He was blind in his right eye.\n\nIt\u2019s not just decades-old stories of racial prejudice that \u201cWillie\u201d covers, but modern ones as well. The film includes testimony of current players from different levels of hockey who have experienced similar problems, most notably former Washington Capital Devante Smith-Pelly, who was racially taunted in Chicago in 2018. For O\u2019Ree, who played several levels of professional hockey until he was 45 years old, threats continued even after the NHL hired him as its diversity ambassador. According to the film, he once received letters from someone threatening to blow up Capital One Arena \u2014 then known as MCI Center \u2014 during one of his events with children in D.C.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the past 23 years, O\u2019Ree has been working with the NHL to promote the game to children in places where there has been little exposure to hockey. He helped establish more than 30 youth hockey programs, from New York\u2019s Harlem neighborhood to Oakland, Calif. He also offers advice and comfort to players who have experienced discrimination in the game.\n\n\u201cNames will never hurt you unless you let them,\u201d O\u2019Ree said during a panel discussion on Saturday, though defending himself from high sticks to the face was an entirely different matter, including one incident that left him questioning his future in the game.\n\nLast year, O\u2019Ree earned a long-awaited spot in the Hockey Hall of Fame as a \u201cbuilder of the game,\u201d something the film humorously teases as if it weren\u2019t inevitable.\n\nAD\n\nThe documentary drew emotional reactions from the Middleburg crowd, including multiple rounds of applause, before the panelists took the stage. Retired player turned hockey analyst Anson Carter \u2014 one of 11 black players to suit up for the Capitals in their history \u2014 moderated the discussion, which included Caps majority owner (and the film\u2019s executive producer) Ted Leonsis, producer Bryant McBride, director Laurence Mathieu-Leger and O\u2019Ree himself. They started working on the film in March, 2018 and completed it in nine months, stressing the importance of getting this story told to a new generation, especially in today\u2019s divisive political climate.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWillie is as hard a competitor and winner [as there is]. For him to get in the Hall of Fame is great,\u201d Leonsis said, then brought up what could be O\u2019Ree\u2019s next major honor. \u201cWe have to get him the Congressional Gold Medal and get him into the Smithsonian.\u201d\n\nFor the film\u2019s backers, the next step is finding a buyer and distributing it, though the extra festival buzz from the Middleburg crowd, many of whom made the trek from D.C., should give it a boost. It\u2019ll next be showing at the Downtown Los Angeles Film Festival.\n\nAD\n\nO\u2019Ree also delivered some news: The 84-year-old will soon be retiring from his regular NHL job, though he still plans on making appearances at special events. He says he wants to travel and spend more time with his wife of nearly 50 years, Deljeet.\n\nAlong with Leonsis, Caps part-owners Sheila Johnson and Earl Stafford \u2014 two of the few black owners of an NHL team \u2014 are also executive producers of the film. Johnson is also the founder of the film festival, and she jokingly heckled Carter for forgetting to tell the crowd that she also owns the Caps. Other attendees of the screening included the Fort Dupont ice hockey team \u2014 the oldest minority hockey club in North America \u2014 and its coach, Neal Henderson, who in December will be inducted into the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The film tells old stories and new ones about O\u2019Ree, a baseball and hockey star from Fredericton, New Brunswick.", "authors": ["Ben Sumner"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/saaHSrfXG3bypwYXej7LKaSqptE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FX7MTSQ4QRBKHPNJ4BPFU64VJI.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
