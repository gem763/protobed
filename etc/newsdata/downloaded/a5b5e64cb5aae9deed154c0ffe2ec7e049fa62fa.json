It's just a waste of profit. Push it.'\n\nHe can then be heard saying: 'Push the f*** out of the scrap yard with a truck.Don't tow it, it's illegal. Push the f*****.\n\n'You get caught towing you get f***** - push it with a truck instead.'\n\nThe driver then pushes the car, which appears to have a colleague inside, in the bus lane and gradually speeds up to the limit.\n\nFootage shows the driver pushing the vehicle, which appears to swerve from side to side, along the road - at times running close to the pavement\n\nHe adds 'why waste a five hour phone call and it runs out of fuel,' before a sudden burst of laughter can be heard.\n\nOne user wrote in a Facebook group that shared the video saying: 'Really not a good idea he was all over the place and could easily have spun the car in front.'\n\nAnother wrote: 'Definitely isn't legal though' followed by two laughing emojis before adding 'F****** good idea though.'\n\nWhile someone else said: 'This is a level of genius I will never reach.'\n\nAsked today if the clip was filmed on Facebook Live, the scrap yard dealer replied: 'Aye, but it doesn't mean I was driving.'\n\nWhen asked why he uploaded it to Facebook he replied: 'I didn't realise it was going to get that many views as it did.'", "description": "Footage filmed by the driver shows the car being pushed along at around 50mph\u00a0on the A694 heading towards Gateshead, Tyne and Wear.", "authors": ["James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/12/20372526-0-image-a-24_1572438779417.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
