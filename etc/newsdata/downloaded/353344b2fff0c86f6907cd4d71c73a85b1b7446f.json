The moment is captured on Channel 5's new show, Fare Dodgers: At War with the Law. At first, the man denies he's carrying a weapon\n\nThe man is caught carrying a samurai sword (pictured). These are illegal in the UK and those caught with one can earn themselves up to four years in prison\n\nUpon entering the bus for their inspection, Thomas admits he expected there may be trouble and says the route, which runs from Edmonton Green to London Bridge, is 'always hectic'.\n\nWhile stopping in Dalston, Hackney, Yaw asks to see the ticket of the man and after discovering he's dodged the fare, tries to get his name and address so he can issue him a fine.\n\nYaw asks him to prove his identity by showing something with his name on it, but after it is revealed he has given false details, the inspector asks him to leave the bus.\n\nHe becomes aggressive as he's asked if he's been stopped before and shouts at Yaw: 'I've got my zip card everyday'.\n\nTransport for London enforcement officer Thomas (pictured) first apprehends the man while verifying that the commuters on the 149 bus route had all paid for their fare\n\nPolice also find the same man wearing a stab vest. He says he wears it because he's already been stabbed repeatedly\n\nThe crew then spot what they believe to be a weapon and a member of the team informs Thomas on the lower deck, saying: 'I think that guy's got a knife'.\n\nThe investigators then send out a 'code red' - meaning police assistance is needed- however, the man leaves the bus before anymore action can be taken.\n\nAfter the pair spot the man at the next bus stop, they're joined by undercover police officers who approach the bus to try and arrest the man.\n\nHowever, he aggressively pushes the officer away and attempts to escape as the officers quickly chase him through the busy street.\n\nInitially, after Yaw asks the young man to show proof of identity, he pleads with the enforcement officer and says he has a new phone and no ID\n\nThomas looks on as the young man hops off the bus in order to flee prosecution - only to hop on the next bus of the same route\n\nAfter he's caught by officers, he's handcuffed and searched by the plain clothes officers, who find a stab-proof vest but no weapon.\n\nThe man aggressively insists: 'I ain't got no f**** knife man'. I always wear that stab vest but it's too hot because I've been stabbed eight f****ng times before and I don't want to f****g do that again, that's why I don't roll with a knife'.\n\n'So I don't roll with a knife that's why I roll with a stab vest and every single f**** time I get searched I have the stab vest you can't f*** say sh**'.\n\nIt's soon discovered he's thrown the weapon into a nearby garden and he's charged with possession of an offensive weapon, as well as crimes committed since the incident. He receives a six-month concurrent detention and training order.\n\nReflecting on the event, investigator Yaw says he 'couldn't ignore' the weapon while Thomas contemplates his own safety, insisting he and his partner have to have their 'eyes open' all the time.\n\n'We have the opportunity, if we see something like that we don't have to let it slip I couldn't just ignore it,' says Yaw.\n\nThomas adds: 'Knife crime is an epidemic right now, it just takes that one person whose got that weapon on him, whose not in the right state of mind or thinks he's being disrespected.\n\n'And we can be not going home. We don't go into work with our eyes closed, we have to have our eyes open at all time.\n\nYaw agrees: 'We have to have our eyes open to get back home to the family.'\n\nFare Dodgers: At War with the Law airs tonight at 9pm on Channel 5\n\nThe man tries to escape the officers, but is eventually caught by officers wearing plain clothes that are located in the area\n\nOfficers in plain clothes bring the man in in their police van after he's arrested following the incident\n\nThomas, looking over at the man, says he thought he could be carrying a knife, and called a 'code red'", "description": "New Channel 5 series 'Fare Dodgers: At War With The Law' shows a man, from the UK, fleeing from police after he's spotted by London Bus revenue inspectors carrying a\u00a0Samurai sword.", "authors": ["Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/18/20002040-0-image-a-41_1571680569039.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
