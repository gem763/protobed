(Courtesy of Dos Mamis)\n\nFew things are as comforting as a neighborhood bar: familiar faces, a reliable atmosphere and bartenders who treat you like a regular, whether it\u2019s your first visit or the 15th. But increasingly, spots catering to a neighborhood crowd are also worth a trip across town, whether it\u2019s for movie nights, an interesting wine list or a new destination for play dates. These three bars, which opened over the summer, will make you wish you lived nearby.\n\n[Summer's great, but now's really the time to visit these new beer gardens, patios and rooftops]\n\nDos Mamis: This bright, welcoming cocktail bar from Himitsu co-founder Carlie Steiner and Taqueria del Barrio founder Anna Bran-Leis is \u201cbuilt for the people who live in Petworth,\u201d Steiner says. The owners have a stake in the neighborhood: Bran-Leis\u2019s taqueria is right next door; Pom Pom (formerly Himitsu) is across the street. But Steiner insists that \u201cthis is a space that\u2019s meant for daily happy hour,\u201d rather than \u201cspecial occasions.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a pitch as good as any realtor\u2019s. The cheery vibes are infectious, whether you\u2019re sitting on the avocado-colored couch that fills the front bay window, pull up to one of the mod white chairs at the bar, or, if you\u2019re lucky, score one of the couches on the cozy rear patio, where potted palms and wandering vines overhead provide the feel of an urban oasis.\n\nThough the owners stress the neighborhood connections, this clearly isn\u2019t your corner hole-in-the-wall. (The cool pinks and blues on the walls certainly make it much prettier.) \u201cWe operate with a cocktail background and a cocktail bar mentality,\u201d Steiner says. \u201cThere\u2019s a place for spirit-and-soda drinks, but that wasn\u2019t our vision.\u201d So yes, you can get a $6 glass of sparkling wine at happy hour (5 to 7 p.m. daily), but your bartender\u2019s more likely to guide you toward the Gin Ne Sais Quoi, a thirst-quenching mash-up of pleasingly bitter pink gin and lemon tonic, \u201caccessorized\u201d with juniper berries and fresh slices of lemon, lime and orange. The house mojito \u2014 \u201cMamijito\u201d \u2014 balances bright, fresh mint and citrus with the funk of mezcal.\n\nEven the frozen drinks veer away from the usual sugar-sweet concoctions: Cu-Cumber Here Often takes a base of gin and fino sherry, then adds salted watermelon, cucumber and lime for a more-ish slushie that's by turns dry and vegetal, a complexity far beyond frose.\n\nGeneral Manager Lauren Paylor is the friendly face in motion behind the bar, juicing, peeling, shaking and stirring, proving that Steiner isn\u2019t kidding about the \u201ccocktail bar mentality.\u201d The prices \u2014 $9 to $13 for cocktails, $10 to $15 for wine, $13 for frozen drinks \u2014 are at the low end of what you\u2019ll find at cocktail bars. Watch out for programming on the patio: A recent screening of \u201cSelena\u201d featured choripan, nachos, candy bars and popcorn, plus one drink for $25. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that brings me more joy than outdoor movies,\u201d Steiner says. 819 Upshur St. NW.\n\n[Need an island getaway?

(Michelle Bove)\n\nThe Eastern: Matt Weiss and Mike Schuster are partners in the Capitol Hill whiskey bar Barrel, but when it came time for their next project, in a new development just down the block from Eastern Market, they decided to move in a different direction than Barrel\u2019s aged cocktails and meat-focused pub menu. That they\u2019d want to change the formula makes sense for these serial restaurateurs: Schuster is a co-owner of the Hill East bar Trusty\u2019s and the critically lauded restaurants Maydan and Compass Rose, while Weiss runs the intern favorite Union Pub and cocktail dens McClellan\u2019s Retreat and Truxton Inn.\n\nWhat they thought the Hill needed, Weiss says, was a solid wine bar that serves good food \u2014 \u201csomething in between a cocktail bar that just serves snacks, and a full kitchen with a scratch menu.\u201d So far, the Eastern\u2019s on the right track. Barrel chef Walfer Hernandez is the executive chef here, and his menu goes beyond the expected charcuterie plates to embrace hummus and smoky eggplant dips \u2014 Weiss credits Maydan as an influence \u2014 as well as lamb meatballs and ceviche.\n\n[Barrel on Capitol Hill has one of the best pub menus in town]\n\nBut the Eastern is a wine bar, in all its mid-century modern glory, where vino outsells all other food and drink combined on many nights. Instead of grouping the menu\u2019s 30-plus by-the-glass options by varietal, small groups of wine fall under suggested headings: \u201cIf you like Bordeaux,\u201d \u201cIf you like Chardonnay,\u201d \u201cIf you like California cabernet sauvignon.\u201d The elasticity of the headings allows it to feature lesser-known grapes, such as Macabeo or Nebbiolo, in a way that appeals to more than wine geeks. (Most wines cost between $9 and $15 per glass, though they can go as high as $22, or even $40.)\n\n\u201cWe were trying to bring a Barrel touch to this \u2014 kind of cheeky but very approachable,\u201d Weiss says. Instead of an intimidating list of buzzwords, \u201cthis gives a novice, or someone who knows more about wine, a nice road map\u201d to find something new. If not, the general manager and the bar manager are accredited sommeliers, as are several other staffers.\n\nBrunch kicked off recently, providing another option for those who want to browse Eastern Market on Saturdays and Sundays. But the Eastern has become even more of a destination at happy hour, where the long banquettes and chair-like bar stools fill up shortly after 5 p.m., thanks to $7 wines \u2014 rotating red, white, rose or prosecco \u2014 and $8 cocktails. 360 Seventh St. SE.\n\n\n\nFamilies, beer lovers and people with dogs will all find something to like about the Garden, the latest addition to Del Ray's Mount Vernon Avenue strip. (Fritz Hahn/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Garden: Del Ray\u2019s newest arrival is a perfect fit for the neighborhood: a spacious beer garden that specializes in Virginia craft beer and an Oktoberfest-friendly menu with bratwurst and stuffed pretzels that also has a children\u2019s play area outfitted with Little Tikes toys and chalkboards, and a pet-friendly water station with metal dog bowls.\n\nThe Garden comes from the owners of the adjacent Charlie\u2019s on the Avenue and the nearby Live Oak, and they\u2019ve nailed the details in the lot that once held Greenstreet Gardens. A layer of pebbles and stones crunches underfoot. There are bar-height wooden tables for adults who are just having beer, and lower, picnic-style tables suitable for families. (At one recent happy hour, where at least one group of moms was getting together to catch up, we had to count to make sure there were more adults than kids in the place.) A corn hole set sits next to a brightly painted wall, and most of the tables are shielded from the sun by fabric sails.\n\nBe warned that there\u2019s no inside seating: Head to a small window to get a drink \u2014 the 20 drafts include prosecco, a grapefruit crush, margarita, Manhattan and cider in addition to craft beers. Don\u2019t feel like getting up, or don\u2019t want to leave the kids? Scan the QR code on your table to order and pay through the Go Tab app, then wait for a server to bring drinks and food.\n\nThe family-friendly vibe extends to the kitchen: Hot dogs, grilled cheese and fish tacos are available on the kids menu, and all ages can get into a basket of peel-and-eat shrimp or cheeseburger sliders. With the music set at background levels, and no TVs to be seen, the Garden is a solid choice for hanging out with friends or, thanks to the WiFi, laptop-toting work-from-home types who want to be outdoors. 1503 Mount Vernon Ave., Alexandria.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe 25 best casual restaurants in the D.C. area\n\nForget the library: The best place to lose yourself in a book is one of these bars\n\nDon\u2019t spend lunch at your desk.
