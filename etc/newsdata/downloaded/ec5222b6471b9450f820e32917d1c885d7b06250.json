I got you. https://t.co/NJRM5NjMJE \u2014 Stipe Miocic (@stipemiocic) October 16, 2019\n\nFunnily enough, Miocic \u2013 the most dominant heavyweight champion in UFC history \u2013 would be the smaller man of the duo if they ever found themselves side-by-side in a street fight.\n\nBut with Garrett\u2019s physical power, plus Miocic\u2019s world-beating MMA skills, only a madman would attempt to try their luck against the pair.\n\nThe incident was noted by Garrett\u2019s team, with a statement from the Browns simply saying: \"The team is aware and the appropriate law enforcement authorities have been notified.\u201d\n\nGarrett is currently enjoying a short spell of time away from live action, with the Browns having their bye week this weekend.\n\nBut the Browns' preparations will continue in Ohio as they get ready for the October 27 visit of the defending Super Bowl champions, the New England Patriots.", "description": "Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett found himself the target of an unexpected attack when the NFL star was punched in the face by a fan pretending to want a photo.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da87563203027145d6f88c4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
