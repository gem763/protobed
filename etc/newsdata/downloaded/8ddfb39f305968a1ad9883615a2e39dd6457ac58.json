We stand by the safety of our product,\" J&J said in a statement. The company did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment on the FDA standing by its test result.\n\nJ&J also ran 48 more tests on samples from the lot that was inspected by the FDA, and said it found nothing.\n\nThe different test outcomes could have resulted from the fact that contaminants are not uniformly dispersed throughout talc and there is no standard test for asbestos in the powder, FDA officials said.\n\nThe agency also said that because of the small sample size used in the tests, it was possible for results to vary. The FDA said that one sub-sample came back negative, and two came back positive.\n\n\"Different samples may provide different results,\" it said\n\nThe voluntary recall was limited to one lot of Johnson's Baby Powder produced and shipped in the US in 2018, the company said at the time.\n\nThat move marked the first time the company recalled its iconic baby powder for possible asbestos contamination, and the first time US regulators have announced a finding of asbestos in the product. Asbestos is a known carcinogen that has been linked to deadly mesothelioma.\n\nJ&J will not reverse the recall of those 22-ounce (650ml) containers, but its baby powder remains available to consumers in stores, a company spokesman told Reuters.\n\nThe recall had been the latest blow to the more than 130-year-old US healthcare conglomerate that is facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products, including baby powder, opioids, medical devices and the antipsychotic Risperdal.\n\nJ&J faces more than 15,000 lawsuits from consumers claiming its talc products, including Johnson's Baby Powder, caused their cancer.", "description": "The pharmaceutical giant disputed the US regulator's findings that the carcinogen was found in its baby powder.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/12/14/b23dbbc2c4264d2fa05f02aceb27651c_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
