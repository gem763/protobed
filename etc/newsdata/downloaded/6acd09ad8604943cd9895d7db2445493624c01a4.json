Bronski Beat - Smalltown Boy (1984) A song about a young gay man leaving home, accompanied by a video which shows desire, persecution, rejection and ultimate freedom, Jimmy Somerville\u2019s anthem epitomised the experience of generations of gay men.

Getty 3/25 23. Angels in America (1991) Tony Kushner\u2019s epic two-part play tackled the Aids crisis in the context of contemporary America and its many ghosts. A profound piece of theatre. Katy Raddatz/Museum of Performance and Design 4/25 22. Madonna - Vogue (1990) Madonna took voguing from the ballroom culture of New York\u2019s black LGBT scene and repackaged it for a global audience, bringing along some of its best dancers for her iconic music video. Her rap, which name-checks Hollywood screen legends, is one of pop\u2019s campest moments. Sire/Warner Bros. Records 5/25 21. Paris is Burning (1990) While \u201cVogue\u201d was for mainstream consumption, the cult documentary Paris Is Burning went behind the scenes of the glamorous ballroom culture, exploring the darker reality of those outcast and stigmatised by a hostile society. Alamy 6/25 20. Carol and Susan's wedding on Friends (1996) While Friends has often been criticised over its LGBT representation, this was one moment it did get right. Rex Features 7/25 19. Macklemore - Same Love (2012) As a rap song advocating for same-sex marriage, \u201cSame Love\u201d sends a impactful message of support from a traditionally hostile area of the music world. Youtube 8/25 18. Britney and Madonna kiss at the VMAs (2003) An obvious and bizarre publicity stunt, but this split-second snog at the MTV VMAs is surely the most famous same-sex kiss of all time. Getty 9/25 17. The Golden Girls tackle gay marriage (1991) Our beloved Miami foursome weren\u2019t just camp icons \u2013 they were ardent LGBT allies. In one much-discussed episode, Blanche is upset that her brother is marrying a man.

Christina Aguilera's \"Beautiful\" video (2002) The gay kiss featured in this memorable video was a huge signal to a generation of kids that their feelings were normal, and that individuality was to be celebrated. An LGBT anthem was born. Youtube 11/25 15. Stephen Fry introduces Grindr on Top Gear (2009) Grindr was brand new when Stephen Fry showed it off to Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson, and his estimated global audience of about 350 million. App downloads quickly shot up, and gay hook-up culture was never the same again. BBC 12/25 14. Ellen DeGeneres comes out (1997) Now the most-high profile lesbian in the world, Ellen took the bull by the horns when she came out in a memorable episode of her sitcom, with a simultaneous cover of Time magazine on which she declared: \u201cYep, I\u2019m gay.\u201d 13/25 13. Queer As Folk (1999) Russel T Davies\u2019s groundbreaking Channel 4 series was unapologetic in its portrayal of gay men and their sex lives, and taught a pearl-clutching British public about rimming. Channel 4 14/25 12. Moonlight wins Best Picture (2017) A powerful portrayal of a young black man coming to terms with his sexuality, Moonlight broke through barriers for LGBT, black and Muslim representation when it triumphed at the Oscars. Getty Images 15/25 11. Modern Family (2009) One of the most successful TV shows in the world, Modern Family succeeded in portraying Mitchell and Cameron as parents just as capable of raising (and embarrassing) their daughter as any straight couple. 20th Television 16/25 10. Boy George on Top of the Pops (1982) When Culture Club appeared on Top of the Pops to perform \u201cDo You Really Want To Hurt Me?\u201d, the androgynous look of its colourful frontman threw viewers and the UK tabloids into a spin. BBC 17/25 9. Lady Gaga - \u201cBorn This Way\u201d (2011) Lady Gaga\u2019s love of the LGBT community, and her status as \"Mother Monster\" for all outcasts, was brilliantly channelled into this mainstream dance hit. In a rebuke to religious inspired homophobia, she delivered the poignant lyric: \u201cI\u2019m beautiful in my way, cos God makes no mistakes.\u201d 18/25 8. Caitlyn Jenner on Vanity Fair & Laverne Cox on Time (2014, 2015) Orange Is the New Black star Laverne Cox was the first transgender woman on the cover of Time magazine, while Caitlyn Jenner presented herself for the first time on the cover of Vanity Fair the following year. Transgender people were being seen, understood and appreciated like never before. 19/25 7. George Michael - Outside (1998) Six months after being spectacularly outed after an incident in a Los Angeles public toilet, George Michael decided to own it, with this number one single, complete with an outrageously tongue-in-cheek video about cruising. Jaw-dropping to this day. Youtube 20/25 6. Glee (2009) Glee presented high-camp musical numbers and wacky plot lines alongside some of the first openly gay and transgender characters seen within a high school setting. Its impact on a post-millennial generation of kids forging their own queer identities was enormous. Fox 21/25 5. Brokeback Mountain (2005) Perhaps the most famous LGBT film of all time, Brokeback Mountain was the first to put a gay relationship front and centre in a mainstream Hollywood plot. Focus/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock 22/25 4. Queen at Live Aid (1985) Freddie Mercury wasn\u2019t open about his sexuality when he stole the show at Live Aid, but he was unmistakably one of our own. His 20-minute tour de force in front of two billion TV viewers goes down in history as the greatest rock performance of all time. Alamy Stock Photo 23/25 3. Philadelphia (1993) The first mainstream film to portray the HIV/Aids crisis was built on a haunting performance from Tom Hanks and brought an understanding of the issue to millions of cinemagoers. Rex Features 24/25 2. RuPaul's Drag Race (2009) The show that launched a thousand memes. RuPaul\u2019s incredible popularity is a testament to how widely the show reached out beyond the LGBT community and into the wider public, who have been duly educated about drag culture and the courage of those who take part. Getty Images 25/25 1. Will and Grace (1998) Will and Grace was the first time a sitcom put gay characters front and centre, and delighted audiences with its razor-sharp wit. Joe Biden once said the show \u201cprobably did more to educate the American public\u201d on gay issues than anything else. Powerful stuff. Rex Features 1/25 25.

Rex Features\n\nThe LGB Alliance will be formally launched in January 2020, but hundreds of people have already criticised the group on social media for its perceived anti-trans stance.\n\nOn Twitter, the group describes its aim as: \"Asserting the right of lesbians, bisexuals and gay men to define themselves as same-sex attracted. Gender is a social construct.\"\n\nIn response to Bailey, one person tweeted: \u201cAs a bisexual woman, I am utterly disgusted at your attacks on our trans siblings and your alliance with the religious right. You do not speak for me (or for any of the other queers I know \u2013 we\u2019re all equally repulsed by your ideas).\u201d\n\nAnother person tweeted that members of the group \u201cshould be ashamed\u201d of themselves.\n\nOthers sought to deny the existence of an \u201cLGB\u201d movement altogether, with one person tweeting: \u201cThere is no LGB movement. Not one that doesn\u2019t stand side by side with trans people. Speaking as a bisexual guy, no less is acceptable, and you definitely don\u2019t speak for me.\u201d\n\nAnother person wrote: \u201cYou can\u2019t be pro-LGB if you\u2019re anti-T. We are one, together. No \u2018LGB Alliance\u2019 will speak for me or any of my friends or colleagues.\u201d\n\nBev Jackson, a co-founder of the Gay Liberation Front, told The Daily Telegraph: \u201cLGB people like us have been writing to Stonewall for over a year \u2013 trying to set up a dialogue with them. It\u2019s about the fact that they have chosen to prioritise trans people and have almost abandoned their original mission: protecting people who are same-sex attracted.\n\n\u201cSadly, we do still need protection. Young lesbians in particular are suffering; experiencing huge social pressure to transition to male if they do not conform to traditional gender stereotypes.\"\n\nStonewall has been keen to distance itself from the group after reports claimed the charity was \u201csplitting\u201d.\n\nPaul Twocock, Stonewall\u2019s interim CEO said: \u201cThere is no truth to reports of Stonewall \u2018splitting\u2019, so please ignore the alarmist headlines.\n\n\u201cThese stories don\u2019t refer to any current Stonewall staff or trustees. There is no equality for lesbian, gay and bi people without equality for trans people. We\u2019re all united in our mission to achieve acceptance without exception for all LGBT+ people.\u201d\n\nThe Independent has contacted LGB Alliance for comment.", "description": "A new lesbian, gay and bisexual alliance group has been heavily criticised for excluding the transgender community, prompting people to label it transphobic.
