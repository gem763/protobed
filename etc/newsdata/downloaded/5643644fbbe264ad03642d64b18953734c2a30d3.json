Aaron Cresswell completed the victory by curling in a free kick in the 84th.\n\nWith Anthony Martial already missing through injury and youngster Mason Greenwood ill, United finished the match without a recognized striker and Jesse Lingard playing in attack.\n\nRashford\u2019s early departure will raise more questions about United\u2019s summer transfer business, when the club failed to bring in a replacement for Romelu Lukaku.\n\nWhile West Ham has 11 points in six matches - after three wins from four - United is three points worse off. Solskjaer is tasked with returning United to the four Champions League places.\n\nJose Mourinho, who was fired to make way for Solskjaer last December, was withering in his assessment while working as a TV pundit on the game.\n\n\u201cWe were bad last season, but I don\u2019t see any improvement this season - even with three new players,\u201d Mourinho said on Sky Sports. \u201cI have to say, players with a positive impact. I like the three and I think they\u2019re bringing good quality to the team.\n\n\u201cBut the team, as a team, I don\u2019t like at all. I\u2019m not surprised by the result and I don\u2019t think Ole can take many positives from the game.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Manchester United lost 2-0 at West Ham on Sunday to leave Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side winless in seven Premier League matches on the road stretching back into last season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/britain_soccer_premier_league_47106_c0-170-4076-2546_s1770x1032.jpg?1b5418e32283b6e7bc54bf2f6cb9452dbeced95c", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
