I had to find a way and the injection was the only thing I could do before the World Cup. If I didn\u2019t take the injection I don\u2019t reckon I would have played a part because it was that bad.\u201d\n\nThe Yorkshireman\u2019s steroid injections, also known as cortisone, alleviated some of the discomfort but he was still severely restricted in terms of what he could bowl during the tournament.", "description": "Adil Rashid has revealed he would have missed last summer\u2019s World Cup had he not been given two pain-killing injections to manage a chronic shoulder injury.", "authors": ["James Watson", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/28/TELEMMGLPICT000203443492-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqLf6XVudQ0d-fF3pHUPFzEJXLXiVyP9u62yFpPEk2K00.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
