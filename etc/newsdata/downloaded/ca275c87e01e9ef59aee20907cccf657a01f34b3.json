Got a question for Polly? Email askpolly@nymag.com. Photo: Long Zhiyong/Getty Images\n\nDear Polly,\n\nMy fear of climate change is eating away at my sanity.\n\nI feel very guilty that the developing world will pay most dearly for the carbon belched from us wealthy nations, but I also don\u2019t want to give up plane rides to Italy, hamburgers, and cheap underwear made in Bangladesh.\n\nWhen that whole anti-straw campaign was going on, I felt like I didn\u2019t give a shit about straws, partly because I read an article saying that fishing nets are the biggest plastic threat to marine life, and partly because I want to continue to have my cake and eat it, too. (I have since bought metal reusable straws.)\n\nPolly, I do all the right things: I drive an electric car. I fastidiously separate my recycling. I turn off the water when I shampoo and condition. I donate to Greenpeace.\n\nAnd yet.\n\nAnd yet even if everyone on Earth suddenly started separating their plastics, we\u2019d all still be fucked for a very long time. The apocalypse is coming. Maybe that sounds dramatic, but that\u2019s truly the crisis call that\u2019s going on in my head. A quarter of the world is going to be facing a severe water shortage very soon, cities will face dangerous sea-level rise, food supplies will be strained. Need I go on? I feel like, why even pursue my dream career or find my dream man if we\u2019ll all be living in bunkers in 30 years?\n\nFeeling neurotically afraid of my carbon footprint every time I step into a plane, while fair, somehow also feels like another excuse for me to feel bad about taking up space in this world. I tend to make myself small to leave room for other people. I fear that if MY suitcase is too heavy, the plane will fall out of the sky. Like, what is that? I fear that as a white woman, being successful in my career will take away from the opportunities of someone less privileged. When considering approaching a guy, I think about all the other attractive women out there that he\u2019d probably think are hotter, and step aside for them.\n\nI want to live with a mind-set of abundance in all aspects of my life while still being responsible in a time of climate change without turning my hair gray from worry. Can you please help me navigate all this with a healthier perspective?\n\nIn Heat\n\nDear In Heat,\n\nIt\u2019s exceedingly difficult to maintain a healthy perspective on a crisis that is likely to lead to the suffering and death of millions of people, not to mention many of the animals on the Earth. The climate crisis is too gigantic and daunting for any plan of attack to feel remotely adequate. The more information you have, in fact, the less you feel that any one strategy in one place will make a dent. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to stay engaged and continue to gather information and continue to fight for our planet. It\u2019s just painful. It\u2019s painful every single day. It feels like we\u2019re doomed regardless.\n\nMy current approach is to narrow my vision to one small, stupid thing I can do at a time. One small thing you can do this week is join the Global Climate Strike, which is going on until Friday, September 27. Skipping work or school, giving those who are on the ground a signal boost or some encouragement, and donating a small amount to an organization fighting climate change: These are ways for you to align yourself with your values and feel connected to the enormous movement of people who are dedicating a huge amount of their energy toward trying to save the planet from destruction.\n\nYour one small thing won\u2019t make a big difference to the future of the planet. We need to cut greenhouse-gas emissions in half over the next 11 years if we want to make a difference.\n\nBut accumulating new small, stupid things to do every day will at least give you the sense that you\u2019re honoring your principles. Instead of feeling overwhelmed and doing whatever the hell you want and feeling shitty about it around the clock, you\u2019ll have a sense that you\u2019re trying to make reasonable choices with the fate of the planet in mind. Even if you don\u2019t cut out every last hamburger, you can slowly encourage your curiosity about great veggie burgers. You can pay attention to that weird thing where the vegetarian seems to order the tastiest thing on the menu every single time. (This wasn\u2019t true a few decades ago, by the way, when eating at vegetarian restaurants was like boarding the tahini train to hell.) You can gather new information and commit to chipping away at your bad habits instead of chipping away at your sanity with a denial-fueled mix of overindulgence and dread. And you\u2019ll think of yourself as someone who does things. That will come in handy, because the goal here is to do more and more things as the days go by.\n\nIt bothers me, lately, that there are so many voices \u201chelpfully\u201d speaking up and informing us that we\u2019re chumps for doing the one small thing that we do, or the three or four small things we do, because it will never make a bit of difference. You don\u2019t have to believe that regular people will triumph over status-quo-loving, polluting profiteers to do these things. You just have to believe that it\u2019s healthier than feeling guilty around the clock. Because every single small thing you do is a part of that larger effort, and it does make a big difference to how you feel about yourself and your life.\n\nWhen you shame others for being earnest and rallying around a worthy cause, you partake in the same toxic, denial-based mentality that led us to this crisis in the first place. Telling people, \u201cYour Prius is idiotic. It won\u2019t make a difference\u201d is a way of excusing yourself from the shared challenges faced by humanity. You aren\u2019t just shrugging off your responsibilities. You\u2019re making other people feel ashamed for having values at all.\n\nI see this all the time these days: people who roll their eyes at activists and outspoken, heartfelt pleas on social media. People who loudly proclaim their lack of interest in what\u2019s going on in our country or our world. People who reduce passionate cries for change to \u201cvirtue signaling\u201d or lump all progressive movements under some \u201ccancel culture\u201d banner. I get it. I\u2019m a cynical dick, too. I\u2019m not a joiner or a team player. Some childish but tenacious core of my being has a knee-jerk aversion to any big group of people who seem to agree with each other, from football fans to Dead Heads. But I do know that shaming people who care about something comes from a place of deep shame about your own most passionate emotions. Saying \u201cThat will never add up\u201d comes from a place of helplessness and despair. If you\u2019re angry at people who are trying to do something, that tells you that you\u2019re on the run from your own feelings of guilt and powerlessness. If you\u2019re irritated by people who show their true feelings about the state of the world, that tells you that you\u2019ve buried your feelings for so long now that all you can feel now is stressed out and annoyed and angry. Stressed, annoyed, angry, shaming: I\u2019ve just described the resting state of 80 percent of the population.\n\nIf we\u2019re going to stand up for the planet and all of the animals on it, we need to dig for our feelings instead. We need to feel the sadness and despair of this moment in history. And we need to figure out how to align ourselves with our values, even when it feels small and pointless and inconsequential.\n\nIn the past few months, I\u2019ve seen an uptick in letters about the climate crisis. To me, that\u2019s a good sign. Outspoken climate crisis activists like Greta Thunberg and everyone involved in the school strikes for climate and the Sunrise movement are starting to make a difference in how we experience this rapidly unfolding catastrophe. Just watching this video about young activists coordinating their efforts around the world might help.\n\nI watched it a few days ago and cried several times. I cry whenever I see kids marching or when I hear Thunberg or another young activist speak. But that makes sense: Sadness and helplessness are a big part of this movement, actually. People tend to associate activism with optimism and even delusion. But the people who get involved in major movements are people who don\u2019t cut off their feelings about the dire state of the world. These are people who experience sadness and helplessness often. Instead of pushing those feelings away, they welcome them in until they\u2019re driven to take action.\n\nEven as the world grows darker, we\u2019re more isolated from each other than ever. We might connect on social media, but we don\u2019t feel capable of asking our neighbors to come over and talk about the crisis we\u2019re in. We\u2019re taught to hide our emotions from the people we see every day. We\u2019re told that strong emotions belong in movies or at concerts, where you pay a $20 or $200 ticket price to feel feelings in the company of other people. We\u2019re instructed to handle our feelings of sadness and helplessness by going out for a nice meal or buying a new lipstick or getting a massage. We don\u2019t feel justified in reaching out to each other in the midst of our terror and anguish.\n\nThanks to the constant drumbeat of news about climate change right now, it\u2019s impossible to feel like you\u2019re doing enough, no matter how much you\u2019re doing. We may not stop the globe from overheating. We\u2019re reaching the point of no return, where things will just get worse and worse whether we cut emissions dramatically or not.\n\nSo existence on this planet has taken on a warped, surreal quality for many of us. Just going to an outdoor mall and walking around, watching a fountain spray water everywhere, watching people eat sushi and meander around with big bags of stuff they just bought, feels like living in the past. It feels odd to buy new things. It feels recklessly decadent to sit down to a meal of food that\u2019s been flown in or shipped in from a few different locations far away. And I think it\u2019s particularly odd to do these things when you have kids who won\u2019t be living this way for long. It feels inevitable that at some point, they\u2019ll turn to you \u2014 you with your aggressive recycling and your electric car \u2014 and they\u2019ll ask, \u201cWhat were you thinking? Why did we own so much shit? You knew what was happening. Why did we run the AC so much? Why did we eat three kinds of unsustainable fish in one sushi roll?\u201d\n\nWhere will you be when they ask this? How many species will have gone extinct by then? How many deadly droughts and monster storms will have hit us? How many economic crises will naturally follow from this moment, which currently feels like some bizarre denial-fueled last hurrah of total excess before things start to deteriorate everywhere, visibly, inexorably?\n\nI don\u2019t have the best answer to the big existential questions posed by climate change. I don\u2019t even know the right questions. Almost every morning these days, I look online for some new action to take, some new method for conserving energy or spreading awareness or just beating the same tedious drum. I keep looking for some comprehensive guide for transforming my own life into one that doesn\u2019t look completely fucked and embarrassing and shameful 20 years from now. At the moment, I\u2019m fixated on how flatly unresponsive the financial industry is in the face of the climate crisis. My reasonably non-evil retirement fund includes just one high-minded Social Reform mutual fund, and one of its top holdings is Facebook, a company that\u2019s repeatedly demonstrated a self-serving recklessness that\u2019s had a direct impact on electing climate-change-denying leaders who seem hell-bent on destroying the planet more quickly.\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting to give a fuck. It\u2019s mind-boggling how few people in power seem to care.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m making myself a Climate Action Plan this week (sounds official, right?), so I\u2019ll have some way of setting new goals for myself and keeping track of them. The first thing I want to do is call that investment firm and ask them about their massive investments in fossil fuels. I want to ask: When will we prioritize the fate of the planet over profits? Once half of us are already dead? How will the stock market be doing once we can\u2019t grow enough food to feed the planet? How rational will it feel to fixate on growth when millions of climate refugees are desperately searching for a way to survive?\n\nAm I sacrificing something I shouldn\u2019t sacrifice? Personally, I feel like I\u2019m old enough that I should have to give up more than my share. My youth was spent consuming without a care. My kids will navigate the world differently whether they want to or not. We all will. So my motto is, \u201cYou have enough already.\u201d I look at the clothes I own and I think about finding ways to wear them until I\u2019m dead in the ground. I look at the food on our shelves and I think about what it would take to eliminate industrially farmed foods and packaged foods entirely. I want to start a list of ideas and get my kids to add to the list.\n\nWe all know that there\u2019s no personal route to being absolved from all sins, past and future. I don\u2019t even think my small things will make a damn bit of difference, honestly. I just think it\u2019s fucking embarrassing not to do every single thing I can do at this point. That\u2019s my personal stance, as a privileged white person who has the time and energy to make choices instead of just dodging one enormous wave of bullshit after another in order to survive. We all do what we can. The only thing that none of us is excused from is voting, and being aware of just how bad things are about to get.\n\nThe more you have, the more you\u2019re obligated to join the fight. The more you\u2019ve taken, the more you need to give. But that\u2019s unrelated to dream jobs and dream men. You can be bold and take up space and have a tiny carbon footprint at the same time. Instead of drawing unhelpful lines from your compulsive self-abnegation to your compensatory, indulgent habits, focus on allowing your feelings into the room. Because the more you feel, the more you\u2019ll do. Sadness is important. I never feel quite right feeding people despair, but right now I think that some of us are sidestepping the despair of this moment in history a little too effectively. The remedy for that isn\u2019t embracing denial or hiding from this darkness, and it\u2019s not joining the \u201cIgnorance Is Bliss\u201d faction of mutants who still care more about profits than the planet, and it\u2019s not being cynical and saying, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do individually so fuck it,\u201d and it\u2019s not beating yourself up for what you\u2019re not doing already.\n\nThe remedy is acknowledging that our world is in trouble and VOTING for candidates who recognize that and are willing to take bold steps to save the planet. Voting is the first and last on the list: registering people to vote, encouraging people to vote, talking about voting until the stars fall from the sky. It\u2019s also important to question those who refuse to acknowledge how bad things are, and to question those who refuse to vote. Yes, it\u2019s uncomfortable. But a lot of people on this planet need to feel a lot less comfortable about what we\u2019re facing.\n\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to do the things you need to do \u2014 vote, talk to people, take action, and make big lifestyle changes \u2014 without FEELING THIS DESPAIR, every day. But feelings are actually part of the package. Feeling these feelings will make you bolder and stronger and more resilient: Looking straight into the face of this sadness, every single day. Seeking out the latest climate news and reading it, from top to bottom. Sending it to a friend and saying, \u201cRead this, as a favor to me, so we can talk about it.\u201d Tweeting and posting these reports, and making your feelings clear to anyone who asks. We need to connect with each other and feel what\u2019s true right now. Feelings like grief and fear don\u2019t drag you back to bed when you confront them every day instead of avoiding them. Recognizing the shape and folds of reality, even when reality happens to be very dark, doesn\u2019t make you incapable of moving forward. Reality \u2014 and the sadness that comes with it \u2014 will propel you forward.\n\nWe have to feel sad, and cry, and worry a little, and then we have to go back to our plans, over and over again, and revise them: I will vote, and I can commit to driving someone to the polls, too. I can eat a little less meat, I think. I can read a new book about industrial farming and think about my habits on that front. I can save a tiny bit every month for an electric car. I can donate a tiny bit more to an organization fighting climate change. I can call one elected representative and read from the script I wrote about the Green New Deal.\n\nEvery small thing will feel stupid. We can do them anyway. Twenty minutes a day, for the planet. Ten minutes. When you feel guilty and hopeless, this is what you do with those feelings.\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s not enough. What will you do? It won\u2019t be enough, either. But this is what I need to feel good at this late date on planet Earth. I realize that now. What will make you feel good? What will make you understand who you are, and feel proud of how you\u2019re living? What will make you feel truly alive and grateful and strong, even now? What actions will honor this dying world the most?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do all of the right things. You just have to try. Trying will make your whole life feel a little bit less bleak. Trust me on that.\n\nBecause when you try, even a little bit, even in ways that won\u2019t make a big difference, you align yourself with the Earth. You stand in solidarity with the trees. You pledge your allegiance to the birds in the skies, to the fish in the ocean. You are connected with those kids marching all over the world this week, desperately hoping that someone will listen to them. Go watch footage of them now, and feel in your cells what it means to care much more than you can stand. It\u2019s like being set on fire. This is your blood, pledging allegiance to the ground. This is your despair, pledging allegiance to the clouds. You are being called to fight for this world with everything you\u2019ve got.\n\nOur feelings will lead us forward from here. We were lost before. We couldn\u2019t feel enough. But now, we\u2019re feeling our way toward hope, together. The sky is on our side.\n\nPolly\n\nPolly\u2019s evil twin Molly has a newsletter; sign up here. Order Heather Havrilesky\u2019s new book, What If This Were Enough?, here.
