Austin has been playing more Card of Darkness, and is starting to see stacks everywhere he goes. Cado dipped back into Life is Strange 2, and found a surprising look at the complex backgrounds that make up Latinidad. Patrick has been running his mind through the gravity-bending Manifold Garden. Then, we answer your questions, from pizza preferences to fantasy archetypes, we'll answer 'em all! You can read an excerpt and listen to the full episode below.\n\nAustin: I actually think that you are like a sword and board warrior. I think\u2013\n\nPatrick: My thought was like \"Yo, I want to be in that Tavern getting fucked\"\n\n[there's a solid two second pause here]\n\nPatrick: \"up.\"\n\n[Cado instantly dies from laughter]\n\nAustin: Huh.\n\nCado [off mic]: God damn it!\n\nAustin: Huh.

I think that's accurate. The thing that I was going to say is you enjoy life's simple pleasures, but you're reliable. You do the day-to-day like grindwork, you know what I mean? Like, why I'm thinking like just a warrior. You got a shield, you fucking take the hits, you deal it out, you know, it's not flashy\u2013\n\nPatrick: Nothing fancy! What do you need me to do? I gotta kill that thing? Got it!\n\nAustin: Got it!\n\nPatrick: See you at the tavern!\n\nDiscussed: Card of Darkness 10:16, Life is Strange 2 16:45, Manifold Garden 26:10, Luigi's Mansion 3 36:00, Question Bucket 46:22\n\nYou can subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, and Stitcher.
