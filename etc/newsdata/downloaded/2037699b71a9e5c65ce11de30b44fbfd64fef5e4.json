(AP) - Virginians who want to use their driver\u2019s license to board a plane now have a year left to get a card that complies with new federal regulations.\n\nWSET reports every air traveler over 18 will need a REAL ID-compliant driver\u2019s license or another acceptable form of ID to fly within the United States beginning Oct. 1, 2020.\n\nA standard driver\u2019s license will no longer be sufficient, but a U.S. passport and some military IDs will be considered acceptable alternatives.\n\nThe Virginia DMV began offering REAL ID licenses last year. DMV Commissioner Richard D. Holcomb tells the station more than 675,000 Virginians have already obtained their REAL ID-compliant driver\u2019s license or identification card.\n\nThe DMV advises that some Virginians may decide they don\u2019t want or need one.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Virginians who want to use their driver's license to board a plane now have a year left to get a card that complies with new federal regulations.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": ""}
