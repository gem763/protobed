I thought the male was never going to stop hitting me. No person has a right to enter my home and take my belongings and hit me.'\n\nThe attraction between Crompton and Welburn in prison was 'instantaneous', Mr Patton said, and although she was married and had recently returned to work from maternity leave.\n\nThey both professed their love for the other and had an intimate relationship, including sex in a cleaning cupboard on the wing, the court heard.\n\nShe repeatedly told Crompton she would leave her husband, also a prison officer, and that she would see him when he was released, the court heard.\n\nCrompton was jailed for life in 2014 for the 'cruel murder' of Frank Worsley (pictured), a Second World War veteran, in his own home\n\nWelburn got Crompton to ask for a transfer to Full Sutton Prison, to reduce the risk of them being caught, and even visited him there, despite the possibility of being recognised.\n\nShe arranged for him to be allowed to call her phones from prison, assuming a false name, and frequently wrote to him.\n\nBut by the summer of 2018, the relationship cooled and Crompton told an officer he had been having an affair with a female guard in what Mr Patton described as 'an act of revenge or spite'.\n\nFrankland Prison (pictured) houses some of the worst criminals in the country including Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe, Milly Dowler's killer Levi Bellfield and Soham murderer Ian Huntley\n\nJoanne Kidd, defending, said Welburn's shame and regret were beyond measure.\n\nShe had a stressful, high-pressure job, was a diligent and caring colleague and returned to work after maternity leave while suffering from chronic back pain, the court heard.\n\nMiss Kidd told the judge: 'Mrs Welburn... talks about seeing herself as through glass. She cannot explain why she behaved in this way.'\n\nThe judge said he could not suspend the sentence but told Welburn, of Abbey Green, Spennymoor, that the 12 months jail was shorter than it could have been on account of her young children.", "description": "Rachel Welburn started an 18-month relationship with killer Daniel Crompton after she became his designated personal officer at Frankland Prison which houses some of the worst criminals in the country.", "authors": ["Jack Newman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/18/19600744-0-image-a-15_1570815053394.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
