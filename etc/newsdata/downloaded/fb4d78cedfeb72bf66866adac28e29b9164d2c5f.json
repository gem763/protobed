Admitting he \u2018may have relied on bad info\u2019 for his attacks on President Trump \u2026\n\nPardon our French but man, this guy is such a jacka*s.\n\nIf one of our top ex-intel officials says he got fooled by \"bad info\"\u2026 what does that say about the intel community structure? #EasilyFooled #CirculatingBadInfohttps://t.co/C7BUuGuPBU \u2014 Sharyl Attkisson\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f (@SharylAttkisson) October 8, 2019\n\nFrom The New York Post:\n\nFormer head of the CIA John Brennan admitted on Monday that he may have relied on \u201cbad information\u201d for his relentless attacks on President Trump. Brennan \u2014 who once warned that \u201cour Nation\u2019s future is at stake\u201d \u2014 told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that he may have been misled on the extent of Trump\u2019s connections to Russia. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if I received bad information but I think I suspected there was more than there actually was,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cI am relieved that it\u2019s been determined there was not a criminal conspiracy with the Russian government over our election.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s relieved.\n\nSure he is.\n\nWonder if this has anything to do with Durham interviewing him here soon. Hrm.\n\nBrennan wasn\u2019t fooled by bad information. He created fake information to try to illegally remove a duly elected President. \u2014 Vicki Huston (@vickihuston) October 8, 2019\n\nNow maybe Brennan will understand why Donald Trump was so vociferous in defending himself against the unfounded allegations, that were putting him, his administration, his family, and this country through hell. Better late than never \u2014 Alabama Truth Seeker (@TruthAlabama) October 8, 2019\n\nI think it says more about him knowing it was garbage, then still attempting to claim innocence. #Brennanknew #badinfoisbs \u2014 Coopster75 (@smarkster) October 8, 2019\n\nAnd he knows he\u2019s been caught.\n\nHe's scared. Good. \u2014 R G (@RGconfidential) October 8, 2019\n\nShouldn\u2019t there be consequences for these people. I mean really, they tried for years to brings down this president. Now, sorry got it wrong and walk away? I don\u2019t think so\u2026 \u2014 Mike McCall (@mbm4osu) October 8, 2019\n\nConsequences? Psh, silly head.\n\nALTHOUGH, the interview with Durham could prove interesting.\n\nHe was so invested in destroying Trump that he believed anything that supported his bias. He is a political hack, not a very good look for the head of the CIA! Says a lot about Obama, too. \u2014 Sharon Lee (@reagan80mom1) October 8, 2019\n\nWelcome to the Resistance.\n\nYup.\n\nHow many people are fed up to here with Brennan?\n\n\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/kurgfyEsHE \u2014 Kosh Naranek (@KoshNaranek9) October 8, 2019\n\n*raises hand*\n\nRelated:\n\nBrit Hume only needs 2 WORDS to sum up Elizabeth Warren getting caught LYING (again) about alleged pregnancy firing\n\nWHOA, she\u2019s right!
