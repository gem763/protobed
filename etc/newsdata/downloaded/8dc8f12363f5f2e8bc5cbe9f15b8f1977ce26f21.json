(Photo: Frazer Harrison, Getty Images)\n\nBusy Philipps was fed up with handling all of the household and childcare duties herself, so she threatened to divorce her husband.\n\nIn an interview with Harper's Bazaar, Philipps revealed that she wanted to end her 12-year marriage to Marc Silverstein because he wasn't helping take care of their two daughters, Birdie and Cricket.\n\n\"My thinking was that if I leave, at least then maybe I\u2019d get two days off a week,\u201d Philipps told the outlet. \u201cI understand that I\u2019m in a place of privilege, and even if I left Marc and I\u2019d been super down on my luck, there was a version of life that I could have made work for me and my daughters. This is not the reality for many women.\"\n\n'He made the call'\n\nSilverstein wasn't here for ending their marriage, so he stepped up. The \"Dawson's Creek\" alum said her husband was willing to do anything to save their marriage.\n\n\"And he made the call: He should be the one to stay home with the kids,\" the actress said. Silverstein began taking over childcare duties for their two girls. He became responsible for Birdie's morning and bedtime routine and cooking meals for the household.\n\n\"I was fully out the door,\u201d Philipps told Harper's Bazaar. \"I wasn\u2019t expecting anything from him, but what we ended up doing was creating our own system.\"\n\nThe roles in Philipps' household changed up dramatically to the point that Silverstein's relationship with his daughters became stronger.\n\n\"He now loves his mornings with the girls,\u201d Philipps said. \"He\u2019ll make my Bulletproof coffee and bring it into the bedroom while I\u2019m still sleeping, and then leave to take the kids to school. He has conversations with them that I\u2019m jealous of. The closeness he now has with these girls, it\u2019s really special.\"\n\nSilverstein opened up about why he was so absent in the household and it had to do with his confidence.\n\n\"I like being good at stuff,\" Silverstein told the outlet. \"And I didn\u2019t feel like I was good (in the home), so I stayed away.\"\n\nSeven years of unpaid labor\n\nPhilipps joins Melinda Gates, wife of Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, in famous moms who say that equally splitting household chores and child care duties has helped their marriage.\n\nGates told Business Insider that their 25-year-long marriage works because she and Bill equally divide the unpaid work it takes to run a household.\n\nShe added that the \"unpaid labor\" that typically women do can be equivalent to seven years.\n\n\"One thing in society we have put on women is we don't talk about how difficult it is to raise children, how much time it takes. We don't even talk about things like breastfeeding. We just assume women are going to go do it. It takes time and it takes energy, right? ...When you add it up over their lifetime, it's seven years of work. I don't know about you, but I think you and I could probably go and get a couple of graduate degrees and a Ph.D. in seven years.\n\n\"Some of that's work you want to do. It's tender; it's lovely. But some of it is also the mundane of doing laundry and the dishes and packing lunch boxes.\"\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/04/busy-philipps-almost-left-her-husband-over-unequal-parenting-duties/3862973002/", "description": "Busy Philipps shared that she was fed up with having to do all the work at home, so she told her husband she wanted a divorce.", "authors": ["Rasha Ali", "Published A.M.
