NATO has fewer than 4,000 troops there, with the mission to keep the fragile peace since the war ended in 1999.\n\nA prosecutor told Reuters the suspects, arrested last year, and one of whom also had a Belgian passport, were supporters of the Islamic State militant group, and some were in contact with Kosovo-born militants involved in fighting in Syria and Iraq.\n\n\u201cThe six people were preparing terrorist attacks inside and outside Kosovo, terrorist attacks against discos in Gracanica, attacks on the Orthodox church in North Mitrovica, attacks on NATO troops in Kosovo and other terrorist attacks in France and Belgium,\u201d the court said in a statement late on Wednesday.\n\nBoth Gracanica and North Mitrovica are areas inhabited mainly by the Serb minority that lives in Kosovo.\n\nMore than 300 Kosovo citizens have travelled to Syria since 2012 and 70 men who fought alongside militant groups were killed.\n\nThere have been no Islamist attacks on Kosovan soil, although more than 100 men have been jailed or indicted on charges of fighting in Syria and Iraq. Some of them were found guilty of planning attacks in Kosovo.\n\nThe authorities face the difficult task of how to reintegrate the returnees. International and domestic security agencies have previously warned of the risk posed by returning fighters.\n\nIn April this year Kosovo brought back 110 of its citizens from Syria, including four fighters, 32 women and 74 children.\n\nThe four jihadists and the women have been indicted for participating in foreign wars, an offence punishable with a prison term of up to 15 years.\n\nProsecutors said they were investigating more than 200 other suspects.", "description": "A court in Kosovo said it had jailed six people, including a woman, for terms ranging from one to 10 years, for planning attacks on NATO troops and the public in Kosovo, Belgium and France.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
