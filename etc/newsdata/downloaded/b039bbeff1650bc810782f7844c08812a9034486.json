Nixon. That Democrats are abandoning these precedents \u2014 and the deeply embedded ideals of due process for the accused \u2014 is a terrible strategic mistake by Pelosi and her party.\n\nCipollone\u2019s arguments are powerful because they are indisputably true. Repetition will drive these stakes deep into the American consciousness. And after the failed attempt to \u201cget Trump\u201d via the Mueller inquiry (and a laugh at people who don\u2019t believe the special counsel\u2019s probe is understood that way), fair-minded Americans will indeed note and refuse to forget that Democrats cheated when they could not persuade.\n\nSecret hearings, witness tampering, refusal of basic and long-standing rights such as the minority party\u2019s right to summon witnesses add up to a rush job, a con job and a collapse of the Democrats\u2019 faith in their own assertions. U.S. Attorney John Durham and Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019s investigations into the origins of the Russia probe may further deepen suspicion of the Democrats\u2019 pretend impeachment. Trump could hardly ask for more incompetent opponents than Pelosi, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). They have time to correct their ill-conceived rush to judgment, but not much.", "description": "", "authors": ["Hugh Hewitt", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions House-Democrats-Impeachment-Inquiry-Is-Kangaroo-Court"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
