Graham\u2019s Turkey Sanctions Bill Includes Sovereign-Debt Ban\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Republican Senator Lindsey Graham is proposing a prohibition on anyone in the U.S. from buying Turkey\u2019s sovereign debt, according to the sanctions bill, as lawmakers aim to escalate pressure on the Turkish government over its actions in Syria.\n\nThe prohibition is part of a menu of sanctions in a bipartisan measure Graham introduced Thursday with Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen. The bill would also target the top levels of the Turkish government, including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his cabinet, the country\u2019s energy sector and military sales.\n\nSpeaking with reporters Thursday, Van Hollen said it is \u201cwithin Turkey\u2019s power\u201d to avoid these sanctions by drawing back from its invasion of Syrian territory that had been controlled by the Kurds allied with the U.S. in the fight against Islamic State.\n\n\u201cWe do not want these sanctions to have to go into effect,\u201d Van Hollen said. However, he added that Congress will insist on punishing Turkey if it doesn\u2019t change course.\n\nThe bill was introduced as Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo met with Erdogan in Turkey and said they agreed to pause military action to allow Kurdish fighters to evacuate the border area. Pence said part of the agreement include re-evaluating Trump administration sanctions ordered last week, although that would not necessarily change proposals from Congress.\n\nGraham called this development \u201cencouraging,\u201d adding that he doesn\u2019t trust Erdogan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to come and hit Turkey hard if they don\u2019t get out of Syria and reset the table,\u201d Graham said. Referring to his sanctions bill, he said he will \u201ccontinue to get co-sponsors, but this sounds positive.\u201d\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, said he didn\u2019t see Pence\u2019s announcement as a win for the Kurds.\n\n\u201cFrom what I understand it\u2019s not a cease-fire,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cYou have one hundred and x number of hours to get out of here before we kill you.\u201d\n\nVeto-Proof Majority\n\nThe sanctions in the Graham-Van Hollen bill would be effective immediately upon enactment unless the Trump administration comes to Congress every 90 days to certify that Turkey is not operating unilaterally in Syria and has withdrawn its armed forces, including Turkish supported rebels, from areas it captured beginning on Oct. 9.\n\nThe version of the bill introduced Thursday also includes sanctions on Halkbank and any other financial institution that \u201cknowingly facilitated transactions\u201d for Turkey\u2019s military. The Trump administration has come under scrutiny for not fining Halkbank for its alleged involvement in a massive scheme to evade sanctions on Iran.\n\nThe same version of the bill would have to pass the House and the Senate before going to President Donald Trump to be signed into law. There is strong bipartisan opposition to Turkey\u2019s incursion into northern Syria, but Senate leaders haven\u2019t committed to bringing the bill to a vote.\n\nGraham said he thinks there is enough support for the legislation to win a veto-proof majority in the Senate.\n\nThe House Foreign Affairs Committee introduced its own Turkey sanctions bill, which doesn\u2019t include the provision to sanction sovereign debt. That bill does include the Halkbank sanctions, as well as penalties on senior Turkish officials and the military.\n\nBoth the House and Senate bills include penalties already mandated by a 2017 law that requires sanctions on Turkey for its purchase of the Russian-made S-400 missile.\n\nAdditional Proposals\n\nSeparately on Thursday, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Jim Risch and ranking Democrat Bob Menendez introduced another sanctions proposal targeting Turkish leaders and people providing arms to Turkish forces in Syria. That bill would also direct Trump to oppose loans to Turkey from international finance institutions and review Turkey\u2019s participation in NATO.\n\nThe Graham-Van Hollen bill is the only one that would restrict purchases of Turkey\u2019s sovereign debt, by directing that \u201cthe president shall prescribe regulations prohibiting any United States person from purchasing sovereign debt of the Government of Turkey.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department has been reluctant to sanction the sovereign debt of other countries, an option that was floated in 2014 to punish Russia, citing concerns that the impact would spill over into the global financial markets. Congress has proposed, but not passed, measures to sanction Russian sovereign debt.\n\nTimothy Ash, a strategist at BlueBay Asset Management in London, said sanctioning sovereign debt would be \u201clights out for Turkey.\u201d He said the penalties against Halkbank and other Turkish banks are \u201calso pretty severe.\u201d\n\nAsh said the bill could be \u201csoftened\u201d as it goes through Congress, with some of the more severe provisions removed, but \u201cthe warning signal to Turkey is pretty stark.\u201d\n\nBipartisan Rebuke\n\nIn a show of bipartisan opposition to Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops out of northern Syria, the House Wednesday passed a mostly symbolic resolution by a 354-60 vote to disapprove of the U.S. withdrawal and call on Erdogan to \u201cimmediately cease unilateral military action\u201d in the region.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday he was encouraged by the House\u2019s bipartisan vote and wants the Senate to pass an even stronger measure.\n\nMcConnell said he wants a measure tougher than the version passed in the House, which he said doesn\u2019t address the plight of the Sunni and Christian minority in the country and doesn\u2019t take a stance on whether the U.S. should maintain a military presence in Syria.\n\n\u201cMy first preference is for something stronger than the House resolution,\u201d he said. McConnell has not yet commented on the cease-fire Pence announced or the timing for a vote on sanctions legislation.\n\n(Updates with cease-fire beginning in the fourth paragraph.)", "description": "Graham\u2019s Turkey Sanctions Bill Includes Sovereign-Debt Ban", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEF4F0W4_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
