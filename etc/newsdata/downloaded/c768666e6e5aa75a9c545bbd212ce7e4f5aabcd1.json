It probably saved my life.\u2019\n\nTownshend had kept putting off having a check for bowel cancer after his father died from the hereditary disease. \u2018I had a cancerous polyp in my bowel,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018While I was waiting for the police to go through my computers, I decided to have that long-postponed colonoscopy. The doctor showed me the polyp. He said, \u201cThis would have killed you in six months.\u201d So it sort of saved my life.\u2019\n\nTownshend, who survived abuse himself as a child and is about to release a novel about sex, drugs and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, says that the stigma of his brush with the law still haunts him.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s something I think about a lot,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019m very much involved in supporting charities that deal with the consequences of the sexual abuse of children, including those that are photographed.\n\n\u2018So no, I don\u2019t think it has passed.\u2019\n\nHe said: 'While I was waiting for the police to go through my computers, I decided to have that long-postponed colonoscopy. The doctor showed me the polyp. He said, \u201cThis would have killed you in six months.\u201d So it sort of saved my life\u2019\n\nOf the original Who line-up, only Townshend and frontman Roger Daltrey, 75, survive\n\nHe says it also gave him a more realistic idea of his own limitations: \u2018The arrest saved my life in other ways too because it freed me from this notion that I could fix everything. The arrogance of the charity work, the arrogance of the mentor, my white knight syndrome.\u2019\n\nHe turned to campaigning as a way of dealing with his own abuse, suffered at the hands of his grandmother, from teachers and in the Sea Scouts.\n\nHe adds: \u2018I feel released from that. I\u2019ve been able to let it go. It\u2019s what old ladies say when they have a heart attack, \u201cGod has ways of slowing you down.\u201d This was something I needed.\u2019\n\nOf the original Who line-up, only Townshend and frontman Roger Daltrey, 75, survive. Drummer Keith Moon died of a drugs overdose in 1978 aged 32 and bassist John Entwistle died in 2002 aged 57 from a heart attack. The band are about to release a new album next month called Who.\n\nTownshend puts the band\u2019s incredible longevity \u2013 55 years and counting \u2013 down to its faithful cadre of male fans, rather than \u2018fickle\u2019 teenage girls.\n\n\u2018They still roll up to see us\u2026 and they\u2019re incredibly loyal.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like they\u2019re following a crap football team and they don\u2019t care how badly we do.\u2019\n\n'Just for the record: my arrest was one of the best things that ever happened to me': The Who\u2019s Pete Townshend explains why, had he not been arrested for child pornography in 2003, he\u2019d have been dead in six months\n\nCOLE MORETON FOR EVENT MAGAZINE\n\n'It\u2019s the elephant in the room, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Pete Townshend sighs, but he\u2019s right. We have got to talk about his arrest, however awkward that feels. The leader of The Who would rather discuss their brand-new album, WHO, the first in many years, and we will. But he has also written a novel called The Age Of Anxiety, a cracking story about sex and drugs and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, and there\u2019s a very obvious personal angle to the book that just can\u2019t be ignored.\n\nIt\u2019s written in the voice of a Sixties survivor just like him, who is accused of doing something terrible, just as he was in 2003. Surely there\u2019s a link?\n\n\u2018I suppose maybe there is,\u2019 says Townshend, who was arrested that year for allegedly paying to access a website offering images of child pornography. \u2018My editor did spend a huge amount of time trying to avoid that rather stinky perfume wafting across the story, because that was not in my mind when I wrote it.\u2019\n\n\u2018The arrest saved my life... because it freed me from this notion that I could fix everything. The arrogance of the charity work, the arrogance of the mentor, my white knight syndrome\u2019\n\nThen he says something extraordinary. \u2018Just for the record: my arrest was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me. It probably saved my life.\u2019 How can that be true? \u2018I had a cancerous polyp in my bowel. While I was waiting for the police to go through my computers, I decided to have that long-postponed colonoscopy. My father had died of colon cancer and I had promised myself I would check before I got much older, but I had kept putting it off.\u2019\n\nTownshend was unable to work for five months while detectives investigated his hard drive. \u2018While I was waiting I thought: \u201cI\u2019ll go and get it done.\u201d The doctor showed me the polyp, a disgusting thing. He said: \u201cThis would have killed you in six months.\u201d So it sort of saved my life.\u2019 He\u2019s never talked about this before. Most people don\u2019t dare ask about the arrest, apparently. His long silence when I first brought it up did make me wonder if I was about to get thrown out of the Sloane Club in Chelsea by a man famous for smashing up guitars. Actually, he seems relieved. Does he feel like some of the stigma has passed at last? \u2018Probably not. It\u2019s something that I think about a lot. I\u2019m very much involved in supporting charities that deal with the consequences of the sexual abuse of children, including those that are photographed. So no, I don\u2019t think it has passed.\u2019\n\nTownshend says he was carrying out research, trying to prove that big banks were complicit in supplying porn to paedophiles\n\nTownshend looks fit for 72 with cropped white hair and close white stubble. He has an air of resignation, like someone who has seen a great deal of life. His answers are careful, intelligent and sincere. \u2018The consolation I have is that the head of Operation Ore, under which I was arrested, is a very close friend of mine and has never believed I was guilty. He was very kind to me when I was arrested.\u2019\n\nTownshend says he was carrying out research, trying to prove that big banks were complicit in supplying porn to paedophiles. The payment was \u2018rescinded\u2019 straight away and no images were downloaded. Accepting a caution meant he was put on the sex offenders\u2019 register for five years. \u2018The arrest saved my life in other ways too, because it freed me from this notion that I could fix everything. The arrogance of the charity work, the arrogance of the mentor, my white knight syndrome.\u2019\n\nCampaigning had been his way of dealing with the abuse he suffered himself as a child, at the hands of his own grandmother, from teachers and in the Sea Scouts. \u2018I feel released from that. I\u2019ve been able to let it go. It\u2019s what old ladies say when they have a heart attack: \u201cGod has ways of slowing you down.\u201d This was something I needed.\u2019\n\nPete Townshend on stage with The Who in 2001 during the Concert For New York City at Madison Square Garden\n\nIn the circumstances, The Age Of Anxiety is a pretty daring story to put out. An ageing rock star has a vision of angels, appears to go mad and disappears off to live as a recluse in the wild. A much younger rock star called Walter begins to hear strange, vivid music that captures the anxiety of the world around him and believes he is going mad too. He turns for help to the narrator, Louis, a cultured, witty art dealer intimately acquainted with the world of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, who is seduced by Walter\u2019s lover, Selena, and later accused of sexual abuse.\n\nI can remember everything about my life, so I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not going to get accused of rape\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not talking in the book about something I have experienced. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever even been close to being accused of rape,\u2019 says Townshend, wanting to be clear. \u2018I had enough sex. I lived a wild enough life, but\u2026 touch wood\u2026 you can never tell. I drank a lot. I didn\u2019t black out. If, like some drinkers I know, I had blacked out every night, I couldn\u2019t put my hand on my heart and say no. I can remember everything about my life, so I\u2019m pretty sure that I\u2019m not going to get accused of rape.\u2019\n\nThere is plenty else in the book he has experienced, including the use of mind-bending drugs to ease mental pain and enhance creativity. \u2018Drugs are a necessary part of the survival of our current species and I wanted my hero to be a man of incredible conscience and sturdiness,\u2019 says Townshend. The book suggests he (Townshend) still believes in the capacity of drugs to open us up to new ways of seeing the world, despite having had treatment for addiction in the Eighties. He\u2019s also a recovering alcoholic who hasn\u2019t had a drink in decades. \u2018Louis is the moral centre of the story, unreliable at times but generous and capable of helping those in need.\n\n\u2018Despite his addiction, I wanted my narrator to be someone who had resorted to drugs as a medicine, in a sense, and at the same time managed to do a good job of bringing up his daughter. That\u2019s a story I see around me with all of my famous friends, most of the people I know in the music business who are pilloried for their bad behaviour. There are very few exceptions.\u2019\n\nThe legendary guitarist as a boy\n\nWho does he mean? \u2018The best example would be Keith Richards, who is on Instagram now with three or four beautiful children, who all seem to worship him. So what\u2019s wrong? What is the position we\u2019re supposed to take? \u201cAh, Keith Richards had a clean supply of heroin, so it was no problem for him?\u201d If you live on a council estate, the chances are you don\u2019t get a clean supply of heroin. That\u2019s the problem. I\u2019m not arguing for the legalisation of heroin, but I do think we\u2019re not getting it right, the way that we view the issue. So I wasn\u2019t making any point with my narrator but I wanted him to be both dirty and clean.\u2019\n\nMany of the other characters are based on friends. \u2018I\u2019m sticking to what I know. Music. Art. People I\u2019ve grown up with, like Craig Sams who started the Whole Earth Foods thing. Or my wife Karen, who made clothes for the King\u2019s Road hippy stores of the middle Sixties.\u2019 They have three grown-up children but were divorced in 2009. He now lives in a Georgian house overlooking the Thames in Surrey with his second wife, the musician and arranger Rachel Fuller.\n\nOther friends provided inspiration too. \u2018People have evolved. Katie Lane, who was married to Ronnie Lane, is very beautiful, very hypnotic, unquestionably somebody who believed in angels and psychic phenomena. She doesn\u2019t seem to dabble with that quite so much as she used to, but there was always a sense that she knew what was going to happen before anybody else did. I folded all of this stuff in to the story knowing I would get it right.\u2019\n\nI think that if I died Roger might continue as The Who. A bit cheeky, but he might\n\nHe wrote a candid autobiography a few years back so this book isn\u2019t that, but elements of it are drawn from his life. As a child Townshend heard strange music in his head, just as the younger rock star Walter does.\n\n\u2018The closest approximation of what I was hearing was probably the music of our song Baba O\u2019Riley: a kind of a sequenced bubbling sound in the air. This happened between the ages of six and 11 or 12, then it stopped. Anyway, I had this idea that perhaps there is music in the universe, perhaps this is what composers pursue.\u2019\n\nThe creator of the rock operas Quadrophenia and Tommy intends this to be another huge production, combining the book with an art installation and a lavish stage performance on the scale of an opera.\n\nThe movie rights to The Age Of Anxiety have already been sold. \u2018I\u2019m asking myself questions every day. Do I want to be in it? Do I want to let Roger [Daltrey] have it? He would be fantastic in the role of the old guy. I want there to be an art installation too. I\u2019ve been talking to a couple of people that work with Kanye West and P Diddy in New York. Young Jewish artists, in their early 20s. Brooklyn-based. They\u2019re very smart. They\u2019re into technology, image projection, artificial intelligence. I\u2019m overwhelmed by the ideas they come back at me with, but every time they do, I think: \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s going to cost as much as a Hollywood movie!\u201d\u2019\n\nWhen will we see and hear all this? \u2018God knows. It\u2019s such an ambitious project, it\u2019s so expensive, I\u2019ve been paying for it by going on tour with The Who.\u2019\n\nThey are currently crossing America, before returning to stadiums in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales in the new year. The Who were three lads from Acton \u2013 Townshend, Daltrey and John Entwistle \u2013 who formed a band and recruited the wild Keith Moon on drums in 1964. Townshend was the son of a professional sax player. \u2018From the age of about two, my memories are about being backstage with my dad\u2019s band. My mum was a singer, so I was very comfortable there.\u2019\n\nHe learned a lesson early, watching Frankie Vaughan perform with the band. \u2018He was a very famous pop singer of the late Fifties, a handsome, Jewish man. He would sing: \u201cGive me the moonlight, give me the girl\u2026\u201d Then he would kick his leg out and say: \u201cAnd leave the rest to me!\u201d All the girls would scream. I loved that thing he did. Then one day he did it at Norwich Playhouse but there was no screaming. Absolute silence. All the young women in their party dresses were sitting with their arms folded.\u2019 What had happened? \u2018I went backstage to ask my dad and he told me that in the first act there had been this young man \u2013 I think it was Marty Wilde or Jess Conrad \u2013 and the young women had changed horses. Frankie was out. No more screams.\n\n\u2018So in the early days of The Who, I remember saying to Roger, Keith and John, who were in it for the money and the girls more than the art: \u201cWe don\u2019t want screaming girls. They\u2019re fickle. As soon as we get a wrinkle or we wear the wrong outfits or somebody pretty comes along, they\u2019ll drop us.\u201d So we devoted ourselves to our male audience and of course it has paid off. They still roll up at s***holes like Wembley Stadium to see us and they\u2019re incredibly loyal. It\u2019s like they\u2019re following a c*** football team and they don\u2019t care how badly we do.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s a bit disingenuous. The Who are widely regarded as one of the three great British rock bands alongside The Beatles and The Stones. Lately though, Townshend has been questioning who they are after all these years, several comeback tours and the deaths of bass player Entwistle and drummer Moon.\n\n\u2018As a musician, I\u2019m caught up irrevocably in The Who, its history, its reliance on the music of the early days for touring, its tragedy with the loss of Keith and John, its possible future and the absurdity in the notion that we \u2013 Roger and I \u2013 could even go out and call ourselves The Who.\u2019 What does he mean? \u2018There\u2019s kind of a game going on. \u201cHey, two of you are dead. One more and you can\u2019t call yourselves The Who any more.\u201d I think there\u2019s a strong possibility that if I died, Roger might continue to call himself The Who. A bit cheeky, but he might.\u2019 Would Townshend do the same if it was the other way round? \u2018I don\u2019t think I could, no.\u2019\n\nHe has no time for rock nostalgia and sneers when I mention their performance at Woodstock, 50 years ago this year. \u2018I remember feeling absolutely powerless in the hands of the audience. Half a million people, all of whom were completely insane. I remember looking around and thinking: \u201cThese people think they\u2019ve done something wonderful but it\u2019s a s*** storm.\u201d That\u2019s how I still feel.\u2019\n\nHe told his wife to stay at the hotel with their newborn son. \u2018We got 100 yards in our limousine before it sank into the mud, so we then had to walk four miles to get to the stage. We arrived at the stage about four in the afternoon and we didn\u2019t go on until five the next morning. I just stood in the mud.\u2019\n\nPete Townshend and Keith Moon in 1973, posing with two models and the Ford Escort 1600 that The Who sponsored in that year\u2019s RAC Rally\n\nTownshend still burns to be relevant as an artist, which is why he refused to tour with The Who again unless they recorded a new album. WHO features their first new material in 13 years.\n\nThe new songs cover a range of subjects, including Grenfell Tower and Guantanamo Bay, spirituality and reincarnation. \u2018Roger and I are both old men now, by any measure, so I\u2019ve tried to stay away from romance, but also from nostalgia if I can,\u2019 said Townshend when the album was announced. For his part, Daltrey, 75, said: \u2018I think we\u2019ve made our best album since Quadrophenia in 1973. Pete hasn\u2019t lost it. He\u2019s still a fabulous songwriter, and he\u2019s still got that cutting edge.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to meet Townshend without thinking of the line in My Generation: \u2018Hope I die before I get old.\u2019\n\nThat was 54 years ago. Now he says: \u2018I\u2019m coming up to 75 years old and I never expected to live this long. It does seem my health is good, so I think there\u2019s a possibility I might live much longer. Whether or not my brain will stay sharp I don\u2019t know, but it feels pretty sharp at the moment.\u2019\n\nHe\u2019s still writing novels and songs in his 70s, creating soundscapes, staging ambitious shows, jump-starting his old band with new songs. There is not the slightest chance that Pete Townshend will just f-fade away.\n\n\u2018The Age Of Anxiety\u2019 by Pete Townshend is published by Coronet on November 5, priced \u00a320.
