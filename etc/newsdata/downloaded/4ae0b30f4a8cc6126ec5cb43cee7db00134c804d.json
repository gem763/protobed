The number includes players across game consoles, computers, mobile devices, and the education-focused version of the game.\n\nNotably, \"Minecraft\" isn't free on the many platforms it's available on.\n\nThe tens of millions of new players \"Minecraft\" added in the last year all bought the game in one form or another, whether it was a direct purchase of a physical copy in a store or as part of Microsoft's popular Game Pass subscription service or a digital purchase.\n\nRead more: Why there won't be a 'Minecraft 2,' according to the people in charge of 'Minecraft'\n\n\"Minecraft\" is getting a major graphics overhaul on PC which employs a burgeoning graphics technology called \"Ray Tracing.\" Microsoft is working with NVIDIA on the update, using NVIDIA's RTX graphics cards. Nvidia/Microsoft\n\nEarly success has persisted\n\nThe game has been a famously explosive phenomenon since early in its life; \"Minecraft\" started as a work-in-progress game, made by a single man (Markus \"Notch\" Persson). It had rudimentary graphics and controls. It was only available on PC. It was prone to breaking, because it was an unfinished game being made by a single person.\n\nAnd yet, millions of people bought and played that early version of \"Minecraft.\"\n\nWhen Microsoft bought the game back in 2014 for $2.5 billion, the tech world was surprised and confused by the purchase.\n\nBut clearly that early success has persisted under Microsoft's care across the past five years.\n\n\"What we find is that it's a game that players keep coming back to,\" Helen Chiang, \"Minecraft\" studio head, told Business Insider in a phone interview this week. \"It may not always be the one that's in the forefront, because there are a lot of great games that continue to come out, but it's one that they love to return to.\"\n\nWhy 'Minecraft' has been such a hit\n\nSo, why is \"Minecraft\" so popular?\n\nWe're talking about a game that looks like this:\n\nMicrosoft/Mojang\n\nThink of \"Minecraft\" as virtual LEGO.\n\nIt's a system for fitting pieces together to create something \u2014 sometimes amazing somethings\u2014 from nothing. \"Minecraft\" provides endless building blocks and a blank canvas; it's up to you to create something incredible, or silly, or referential, or whatever else using the tools it provides. The tools are blessedly user-friendly, as are the systems for employing those tools.\n\nWith that in mind, it's easy to understand why \"Minecraft\" has been such a hit.\n\nThat it's graphically rudimentary and simple to play just makes it all the more accessible to a massive audience \u2014 over 112 million people every month, apparently.", "description": "Every month, over 112 million people play Microsoft's biggest game: \"Minecraft.\" In fact, the game has been hugely popular for years.", "authors": ["Ben Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c4204f03028c157a4374fd4-960-480.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
