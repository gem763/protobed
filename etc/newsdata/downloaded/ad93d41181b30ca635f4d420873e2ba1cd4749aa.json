The tech giant has made a bid for the fitness hardware maker, but there\u2019s no confirmation that an acquisition will take place at this time. We don\u2019t know how much Alphabet bid for fitbit either.\n\nThe partnership makes some sense. While Fitbit continues to be popular in the fitness market, it\u2019s struggled to make a mark with the \u2018smart\u2019 portion of its smartwatches. Google, meanwhile, has been partnering with third-party companies making Android Wear watches forever, but their sales pale in comparison to the Apple Watch.\n\nGoogle has begun taking hardware into its own hands in the last few years, introducing phones, laptops, speakers, and more. One thing it hasn\u2019t made for itself yet? A smartwatch. And as Reuters points out, Fitbit has seen increasing competition from companies making cheaper products, like Huawei and Xiaomi. That said, I can\u2019t imagine Alexa would stick around on Fitbit\u2018s watches very long if the companies joined forces.\n\nThere\u2019s no word on when or if a deal will happen, but given it would seem a mutually beneficial partnership, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it come to fruition. If Googlebit becomes a thing, may I suggest bringing back Pebble OS? Thanks.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FGoogle-Fitbit-1.jpg&signature=a522ce59cff58b4a84b459a5f8998dac", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
