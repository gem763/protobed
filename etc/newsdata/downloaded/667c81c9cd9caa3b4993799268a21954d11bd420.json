Adam Schiff said the House Intelligence Committee \u201calready has an agreement with the whistleblower\u201d and \u201cthat he will testify\u201d:\n\nScott Pelley: Do you expect the testimony of the whistleblower? Adam Schiff: Absolutely. Scott Pelley: Your committee already has an agreement with the whistleblower that he will testify? Adam Schiff: We have an agreement that he or she will testify, yes. \u2014 Laura Walker \ud83c\udf78\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc63\udb40\udc74\udb40\udc7f (@LauraWalkerKC) September 30, 2019\n\nWell, shortly after the interview aired, the whistleblower\u2019s lawyer released a statement contradicted what Rep. Schiff told Scott Pelley:\n\nDocument Update: Please go here to see correspondence that has been recently uploaded. Thank you.https://t.co/smayEkwMyr \u2014 Andrew P. Bakaj (@AndrewBakaj) September 30, 2019\n\nRep. Schiff gave the impression that the interview was a done deal, but \u201cWhile discussions continue to occur to coordinate and finalize logistics, no date/time has yet been set\u201d makes it much less certain:\n\nAnd Mark Zaid tweeted earlier in the day that \u201cwhistleblower testimony\u201d might not mean \u201ctestimony.\u201d They\u2019re referring to \u201ccongressional contact generally,\u201d whatever that means:\n\nI repeat: \"testimony\" is generic term. I am referring to congressional contact generally. https://t.co/boa0TnDIck \u2014 Mark S.
