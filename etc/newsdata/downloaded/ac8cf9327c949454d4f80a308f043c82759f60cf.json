REUTERS/Carlos Jasso\n\nThe abduction and apparent massacre of the youths, widely believed to have been committed by corrupt police working with a violent drug gang on the night of Sept. 26, 2014, drew international outrage and condemnation of the administration of former President Enrique Pena Nieto.\n\nPressure has been growing on Pena Nieto\u2019s successor, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, to fulfill his promises to uncover what really happened in a case that many Mexicans link to federal authorities.\n\nOne place being searched is a garbage dump in Tepecoacuilco, a few miles from the southwestern city of Iguala in Guerrero state where the student teachers were abducted.\n\nMexico\u2019s undersecretary for human rights, Alejandro Encinas, spoke of the site in comments to reporters at a regular news conference on Thursday flanked by Lopez Obrador.\n\nBoth men and other officials shed their usual suits for T-shirts emblazoned with the number 43 to commemorate Thursday\u2019s anniversary of the students\u2019 disappearance.\n\nEncinas said the armed forces, the attorney general\u2019s office and members of a presidential commission were all taking part in the search at the dump, which started last weekend. Searches carried out in other sites over the past few weeks have not turned up remains of the students, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that in the Ayotzinapa case, the only truth until now is that there is no truth,\u201d said Encinas. Ayotzinapa is where the students\u2019 all-male college is located.\n\nA special prosecutor appointed to oversee the re-examination of the case said last week that authorities would virtually \u201cstart from scratch\u201d after previous mishandling of the case.\n\nThe lack of progress was brought into focus earlier this month when a judge ordered the release of Gildardo Lopez Astudillo, a gang leader blamed for ordering the killing of the students.\n\nThe government on Thursday reiterated an offer of rewards of 1,500,000 pesos ($76,000) per student for any credible information about the case.\n\nPROBE \u2018DISCREDITED\u2019\n\nLopez Obrador took office in December pledging to pursue the Ayotzinapa investigation. His government has described the original probe as \u201cdiscredited\u201d and vowed to go after the officials who led it.\n\nOfficials said they would call Jesus Murillo, the attorney general who oversaw the Pena Nieto-era probe into the disappearances, to answer questions about it next week.\n\nAngela Buitrago, a consultant named by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights who is helping to oversee the new probe, said it could not advance without investigating military officials who were present in Iguala five years ago.\n\nLopez Obrador said in December that military officials should be put under scrutiny in relation to the case, but it is not clear how that aspect of the probe has advanced so far.\n\nSlideshow (33 Images)\n\nAccording to the Pena Nieto administration, local drug gang Guerreros Unidos mistook the students for members of a rival outfit, killed them, incinerated their bodies in a nearby garbage dump and tipped their remains into a river.\n\nHowever, the remains of only one of the 43 was ever definitively identified, and a group of independent experts later picked several holes in the official version of events presented in 2015.\n\nThe United Nations human rights office said in a report last year that it appeared Mexican authorities had tortured dozens of people during the investigation. Out of 142 suspects detained in the case, more than half have been released.", "description": "Mexican officials have begun scouring new sites for the remains of 43 student teachers who disappeared five years ago, after authorities said they would start the investigation from scratch after discarding the results of their predecessors' probe.", "authors": ["Lizbeth Diaz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434333083&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P2A0", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
