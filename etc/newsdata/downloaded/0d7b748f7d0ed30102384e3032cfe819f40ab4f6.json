In his new book, Catch and Kill, Farrow quietly divulges that he proposed to Lovett while he was reporting the book, which he did in the most writerly way possible: by hiding the proposal in a draft of Catch and Kill. In the book, Farrow describes a scene between himself and Lovett at his Los Angeles home, where Lovett was comforting him after a particularly infuriating call with embattled NBC executive Noah Oppenheim. \u201cHe hugged me around the middle like a kid hugging a stuffed animal,\u201d Farrow writes of Lovett, who had listened to the call in the background. \u201cIt had been a long year, for me and for us, but we hung in there.\u201d Then Farrow describes how he decided to pop the question:\n\n\u201cLater, when I decided some of that reporting would make its way into a book, I\u2019d send him a draft, and put in a question, right on this page: \u201cMarriage?\u201d On the moon or even here on earth. He read the draft, and found the proposal here, and said, \u2018Sure.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs Farrow writes earlier in the book, he and Lovett \u2014 who have been romantically linked since 2011 \u2014 have long had a running joke about getting married on the moon, as Lovett\u2019s mother made it clear to them that she \u201cwanted grandchildren, and not in the age of lunar bases.\u201d The proposal, if you put the infuriating NBC reporting aside, is quite sweet. We\u2019re just stuck on one thing: Sure!?!?", "description": "In his new book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d journalist Ronan Farrow reveals that he is engaged to Jon Lovett, and that he popped the big question creatively: by hiding it in a draft of his book.", "authors": ["Amanda Arnold"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/06/19-jon.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
