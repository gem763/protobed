Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official overseeing Ukraine policy, told House impeachment investigators that he objected to EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland's comments in a July 10 White House briefing \u2014 attended by Perry \u2014 requesting that Ukrainian officials investigate the 2016 U.S. election, the Bidens and the Ukrainian energy company Burisma that had employed Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cI stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the [National Security Council] was going to get involved in or push,\u201d Vindman's statement said.\n\nVindman said in his remarks that after he raised his objections, Fiona Hill, who was a Trump adviser on Russia at the time, entered the room and told Sondland his statements were inappropriate.\n\nAccording to NBC News, Hill told House investigators that she entered the room as Perry was leaving. That account was confirmed to POLITICO.\n\nThat timeline would put Perry in the meeting when Vindman raised his objections about Sondland's request that Ukrainian officials investigate the Bidens \u2014 which Perry has repeatedly denied.\n\n\"Not once, as God is my witness, not once was a Biden name \u2014 not the former vice president, not his son \u2014 ever mentioned,\" Perry told the CBN News on Oct. 7. He repeated those denials in a Fox News radio interview last week.\n\nA DOE spokesperson said Perry stands by his earlier statement but did not comment on the July 10 meeting.\n\nPerry, who plans to step down from office on December 1, refused earlier this month to comply with congressional subpoenas seeking information on meetings and phone calls he took part in involving Ukraine officials.\n\nFiona Hill, senior director for European and Russian Affairs on the National Security Council, listens as President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Tuesday, April 2, 2019, in Washington.

That meeting was abruptly halted by then-national security adviser John Bolton after Sondland began discussing Ukraine conducting specific investigations in order to secure a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Trump.\n\nSondland has said that he, Perry and former U.S. special representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker were the \"three amigos\" on Ukraine outreach for the administration.\n\nBut some Democrats have begun to question whether Sondland, a Republican donor, perjured himself during his closed-door testimony to impeachment investigators earlier this month.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have also said they also want to review allegations that Perry pressured Ukraine officials to fire from the advisory board of the country\u2019s state-owned natural gas company Amos Hochstein, a former Biden aide and State Department energy official who is also an executive at a U.S. LNG company.\n\nPerry pushed two Houston oil and gas executives to take Hochstein\u2019s place, sources said earlier, although Perry has said he only offered the two men as potential advisers to the company.", "description": "Testimony from a senior White House official on Tuesday appeared to contradict Energy Secretary Rick Perry's ardent denials that he ever heard former Vice President Joe Biden or his son Hunter discussed in relation to U.S. requests that Ukraine investigate corruption.
