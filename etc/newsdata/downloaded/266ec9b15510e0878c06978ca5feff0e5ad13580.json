It was not the alarming, career-ending allegation it perhaps should have been. Even with Edwardes\u2019 social standing \u2013 a factor that unfortunately carries too much weight in cases such as these \u2013 what should have been a public discussion about a potential glimpse at the prime minister\u2019s penchant for abusing power (a matter that has been raised in other contexts time and again) fell rather short of that mark. Instead, the historic incident was treated like a case of playground whispers, with more questions raised about the timing of Edwardes\u2019 column than how to sensitively and appropriately handle the allegation.\n\nIt must\u2019ve been a misunderstanding, some opined. If it had been me, I would\u2019ve counted myself lucky, others argued, ignoring the fact that the alleged victim said she had not given her consent for such an encounter; ignoring the historical mishandling of cases such as these; and, crucially, ignoring the fact that the frequency of false accusations of rape and sexual assault have been inflated by our own prejudices. In actual fact, false rape accusations are far less common than cases of sexual assault and of rape.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Even before the woman in question withdrew her complain and wrote a confession in which she reportedly admits that she falsified her original accusation (which she now alleges she was coerced into doing), people seemed to instinctively rally around the accused. Without being privy to any of the facts, the incident quickly sparked a debate about the virtues of certain \"types\" of men over certain types of women. A number of prominent Israeli commentators wrote columns giving credence to the alleged perpetrators\u2019 police statements; others suggested that the sheer volume of men involved was itself enough to prove that the British teenager was lying. That point of view has now become so widespread that the Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel, and other activists, are still having to speak out to counteract it.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Headlines such as \u201cAyia Napa \u2018rape lie\u2019 Brit, 19, suffering with PTSD\" abound. Meanwhile the teenager\u2019s lawyers\u2019 maintain that \u201cthere have been clear failings in regards to the investigation\u201d, including the fact that the accused have allegedly since shared \u201crevenge porn\u201d of the incident \u2013 an issue that, depending on which side of the fence you\u2019re on, either strengthens or weakens the alleged victim\u2019s case.\n\nWhile the truth of the matter cannot be known at this stage to anyone outside the criminal justice service, there are statistics available that should deter us from making unfounded assumptions about those involved. Men are statistically more likely to be victims of rape than they are to be falsely accused of it. In fact, statistics show that men are \u201c230 times more likely to be raped than to be falsely accused of rape\u201d. And research for the Home Office shows that \u201conly 4 per cent of cases of sexual violence reported to the UK police are found or suspected to be false.\"\n\nWhile those facts alone do not prove anything when it comes to those 12 men (or, indeed, the behaviour of the prime minister), they do show that jumping to conclusions based solely on the fear of the potential damage the accusations will have on the lives of those involved, is unwise. More than that, it tells victims that they should consider the wellbeing of their attackers over their own.\n\nWhen we take positions on such sensitive issues based tribal loyalties, we fail more than just the people involved in one case, which in itself is bad enough. We\u2019re failing people everywhere who have been told, and are still told, by society that whatever they say was done to them, it won't take priority over the reputations of those we respect and whom they have accused.\n\nWhich, sadly, almost always seems to be men.", "description": "The crimes of rape and sexual assault are complex things, so it\u2019s curious how readily some of us are willing to abandon that idea when it comes to certain cases,\u00a0often over little more than our preconceived views of the parties involved.", "authors": ["Kuba Shand-Baptiste"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/29/14/AFP-1J66X4.jpg"}
