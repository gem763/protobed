While the league is still investigating the matter, Buster Olney of ESPN hears that Germ\u00e1n \u201cwill not pitch another inning\u201d in 2019, including the postseason.\n\nThis is not shocking, as even the the most minor suspensions under the Domestic Violence policy have typically entailed more than the eight games the Yankees have remaining. And based on what we\u2019ve been hearing over the past 24 hours, the suspension Germ\u00e1n will receive is likely to be substantial.\n\nBob Klapisch of the New York Times tweeted yesterday that German allegedly slapped his girlfriend. Andy Martino of SNY reported that the incident took place late Monday or early Tuesday following a charity gala which took place at CC Sabathia\u2019s home. Klapisch says someone from the Commissioner\u2019s Office witnessed it, though Martino disputes that. What\u2019s not in dispute is that the MLBPA opted not to exercise its right to appeal German\u2019s placement on administrative leave pending the investigation, so the evidence is likely pretty damning.", "description": "Domingo Germ\u00e1n could receive a substantial suspension in the coming days", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/92YNXHtrCFImCILF6fWsZA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MbdOb1ic6FgSfvlcHgWTBQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/9a5321373d955d5954f422daf238931a", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
