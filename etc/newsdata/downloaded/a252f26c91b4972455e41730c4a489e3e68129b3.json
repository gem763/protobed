Macy, looked sombre when they arrived at the Boston federal courthouse about 30 minutes before her scheduled sentencing by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani.\n\nProsecutors recommended that the judge sentence Huffman to one month behind bars after her guilty plea in May to conspiracy related to her payment of $15,000 to have someone secretly correct her daughter\u2019s answers on the SAT college entrance test, according to court documents.\n\nThe sentencing is set for 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT).\n\nThe former \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star is among 51 people accused in a scheme in which wealthy parents paid to secure spots for their children in prominent U.S. universities including Yale, Georgetown and the University of Southern California, through cheating on entrance exams or bribes paid to college athletic team coaches.\n\nAlso among parents charged in the scandal was actress Lori Loughlin, who starred in the TV series \u201cFull House,\u201d and her designer husband Mossimo Giannulli.\n\n\u201cIncarceration ... would provide just punishment for the offence, make it clear that this was a real crime, causing real harm, and reinforce the vital principle that all are equally subject to the law regardless of wealth or position,\u201d U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said in pre-sentencing documents that also recommended a $20,000 fine and one year of probation.\n\nHuffman\u2019s attorneys argued in their own court documents that she is \u201cremorseful\u201d and \u201cdeeply ashamed\u201d and should remain free on one year\u2019s probation, complete 250 hours of community service and pay a $20,000 fine.\n\n\u201cI find Motherhood bewildering,\u201d Huffman, 56, said in a letter to the judge.\n\nHer daughter, who was 4 years old when Huffman first started trying to help her deal with learning disabilities, was unaware of the cheating scheme until Huffman\u2019s arrest in March, she said.\n\n\u201cMy daughter looked at me and asked with tears streaming down her face, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you believe in me? Why didn\u2019t you think I could do it on my own?\u2019 ... I have compromised my daughter\u2019s future, the wholeness of my family and my own integrity,\u201d Huffman said in her letter.\n\nMacy said their daughter initially had been accepted to her desired school - which does not require SAT scores. That school was not named in his letter to the judge.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\n\u201cShe started as one of several thousand applicants and after making it through many auditions, she flew to the school two days after her mom\u2019s arrest for the final selections. When she landed, the school emailed her withdrawing their invitation to audition,\u201d Macy said.\n\nHuffman said the cheating scheme was proposed by William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, a California college admissions consultant at the centre of the scandal.\n\nSinger pleaded guilty in March to charges he helped bribe university sports coaches to present clients\u2019 children as fake athletic recruits. His sentencing was set for later this month.", "description": "Actress Felicity Huffman, the first parent set to be sentenced in a wide-ranging U.S. college admissions cheating scandal, faces possible prison time on Friday after pleading guilty to paying to rig her daughter's entrance exam.", "authors": ["Valerie Vande Panne", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429531136&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C211", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
