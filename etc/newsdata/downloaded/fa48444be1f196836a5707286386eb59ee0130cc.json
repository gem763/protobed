REUTERS/Gretchen Ertl/File Photo\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign canceled campaign events and pulled TV ads after the 78-year-old U.S. senator had two stents inserted into an artery after he experienced discomfort during a campaign visit to Nevada on Tuesday.\n\nThe candidate would rest for a few days after the relatively common procedure, his campaign for the November 2020 presidential election said.\n\nSanders\u2019 speechwriter, David Sirota, said in a daily newsletter that the unexpected medical procedure was \u201ca perfect example of why the United States needs to join the rest of the world and pass Bernie\u2019s Medicare for All legislation.\u201d\n\nSirota cited a 2018 paper by researchers at the London School of Economics that found cardiac implant devices cost up to six times more in the United States than in some European countries with government-run healthcare systems.\n\nSanders advocates an approach that would extend the existing Medicare program for Americans aged over 65 to all Americans and largely eliminate the private insurance industry.\n\nSirota argued the gulf in price was in part due to the U.S. healthcare system\u2019s \u201ccomplex web of payers - rather than a single-payer Medicare for All system that can negotiate better prices.\u201d\n\nAs many as 1 million Americans a year get stents, a procedure that involves inserting a balloon-tipped catheter to open blockage and deploy tiny wire-mesh tubes to prop open the artery.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling good. I\u2019m fortunate to have good health care and great doctors and nurses helping me to recover,\u201d Sanders tweeted on Wednesday afternoon, his first public statement since the procedure.\n\n\u201cNone of us know when a medical emergency might affect us. And no one should fear going bankrupt if it occurs. Medicare for All!\u201d\n\nNews of Sanders\u2019 health scare sparked mean-spirited jokes pointing out the U.S. senator was treated by the healthcare system he wants to overhaul.\n\n\u201cAny bets on whether he\u2019ll be going to Cuba for their great communist medical care? Get well soon Bern. #SocialismSucks!\u201d tweeted Ben Bergquam, a right-wing California radio host.\n\nSanders\u2019 supporters also took to social media to post #GetWellBernie messages.\n\nThe senator from Vermont\u2019s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, retweeted one message from a supporter that read, \u201ctake my heart bernie!!\u201d", "description": "Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential election campaign on Wednesday sought to use news the candidate had a heart procedure to highlight the benefits of his trademark Medicare for All healthcare plan.", "authors": ["Simon Lewis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436379737&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911Q4"}
