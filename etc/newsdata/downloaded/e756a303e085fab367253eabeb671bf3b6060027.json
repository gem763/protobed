I spot a celebrity, and she tells me that\u2019s absolutely not them. If it weren\u2019t for her, I\u2019d end up on r/notreallyfamous, the subreddit for mistaken celebrity sightings.\n\nThese posts are cute because of people\u2019s enthusiasm \u2014 they think, or they do a good job pretending, that they really met a celeb, despite all evidence against it. (A good r/notreallyfamous post isn\u2019t just \u201cHey, this regular person resembles this celebrity!\u201d For that, go to the more popular subreddit Walmart Celebrities.)\n\nWe collected our favourites here. We can\u2019t copy the pictures because they aren\u2019t ours, but if you open thirty new tabs you will be rewarded.\n\nThere are a few types of fake celebrity sighting. Sometimes, people fall for an impersonator:\n\nSometimes they happen upon an unassuming stranger:\n\nSometimes the mistaken identity is very official:\n\nSometimes it comes in threes:\n\nSometimes I\u2019m convinced that it really was the celebrity:\n\nSometimes it really really is a celebrity:\n\nSome make no fucking sense:\n\nYeah, some of these fake sightings were probably a joke in the first place. But don\u2019t tell me. I can\u2019t bear two letdowns in a row.\n\nFor more lookalikes without the \u201cactually mistaken for a celebrity\u201d requirement, see r/WalmartCelebrities.\n\nFor people who look like the signs they\u2019re standing next to, see r/PSUSTRT. For knockoff merchandise, try r/crappyoffbrands. For the post that inspired r/notreallyfamous in 2014, see this Fake Gyllenhaal sighting.\n\nWhat I really want is a celebrity pretending to be a normal person pretending to be a celebrity \u2014 like when Bryan Cranston wore a mask of himself around Comic-Con, or when Julia Roberts played a Julia Roberts lookalike posing as Julia Roberts.", "description": "My wife and I have a game we play on the streets  of New York.
