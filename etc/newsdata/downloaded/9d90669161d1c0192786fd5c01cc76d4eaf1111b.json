With everything that is going on in society, when a kid walks into an ice rink, he or she should be free from outside noise.\"\n\nThe rule applies to all U.S.-based leagues, including the United States Hockey League, the country's top junior league and a strong feeder system for college hockey and the NHL.\n\nOBIT:Hockey Hall of Famer, longtime NHL executive Jim Gregory dies at 83\n\nWATCH:Hurricanes' Andrei Svechnikov scores lacrosse-style goal\n\nU.S. leagues will have up to 30 days to investigate and hold a hearing for players who are penalized under Rule 601 (e.3). Those players are subject to further discipline.\n\nSmith said he didn't believe a game misconduct sent a strong enough message.\n\n\"I think a match penalty will catch people's attention, especially when they have to sit through 30 days and a hearing,\" Smith said, \"and really think about the language that was hurtful and demeaning. I think this will, I hope, will eradicate all of it.\"\n\nSmith said the tougher penalty is just the first step in a new initiative, which will include a coaching education component and some additions to USA Hockey's parent education material.\n\n\"The adults have to reinforce to the kids that any kind of derogatory or hurtful language, during a game or practice or whenever, to another peer just has no place in our game,\" he said.\n\nSmith said the initial response to this decision has been positive.\n\n\"It's hard to argue against this,\" he said.", "description": "USA Hockey says a player who uses a racial or derogatory slur will get five-minute penalty, game misconduct and is suspended until a hearing is held.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/30/USAT/1686c884-b9eb-4f46-8f6b-fe8236eb2f9c-usa_hockey_.JPG?crop=1714,1714,x288,y858&width=1674&height=1714&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
