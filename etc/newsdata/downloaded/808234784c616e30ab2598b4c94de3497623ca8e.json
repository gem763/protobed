She was then sent for Mohs surgery and left with a gaping hole in her nose, which required taking a flap of skin from her forehead to repair.\n\nMohs surgery is performed while the patient is awake and alert, but numbed in the affected area, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. A certified surgeon cuts out the visible skin cancer, and removes a thin layer of surrounding skin, repeating the procedure until no more cancer cells are found in the removed skin. While some wounds heal without stitches, others, like Rupp, will require a skin graft.\n\nMINNESOTA MAN CONTRACTS RARE FUNGAL INFECTION THAT KILLED HIS DOG LAST YEAR\n\nIn Rupp\u2019s case, it took four weeks for the wound to heal before a reconstructive surgeon could remove the flap from her nose. She had her final surgery on July 9.\n\nRupp \u2014 who said she knew the dangers of tanning but \u201cloved\" how it made her feel, and also said her hobby \u201crelaxed\u201d her and \u201cmade me feel pretty\u201d \u2014 now works for a skincare company and is urging others to take better care of their skin.\n\n\u201cI was a diehard tanning bed tanner,\u201d she told MDW Features. \u201cIn my earlier years, I tanned at least five to six times a week. I was told by others it was bad for me, but until it happened to me \u2013 I never listened.\u201d\n\nRupp was not unlike other college students, as the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) found 59 percent of the students have reported using a tanning bed in their lifetime. The AAD estimates approximately 7.8 million adult women and 1.9 million adult men in the U.S. still use indoor tanning facilities.\n\nSeveral health organizations have declared ultraviolet radiation from the sun and artificial sources to be a known carcinogen. It has been found to be a cause of melanoma and increase the risk of a benign mole progressing to melanoma. Researchers also estimate that indoor tanning may cause upwards of 400,000 cases of skin cancer in the U.S. each year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cProtect your skin while you have it,\u201d Rupp told MDW Features. \u201cDon\u2019t tan in tanning beds or expose your skin to sun exposure without using sunscreen and wearing protection on your head.\u201d", "description": "She said she would tan up to six times per week.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/skin-cancer3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
