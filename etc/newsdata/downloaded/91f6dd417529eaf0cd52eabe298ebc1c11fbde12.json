Adam Kinzinger: I\u2019m an Air Force veteran -- Here's the real truth about the Trump Turnberry stopover", "language": "en", "text": "A good headline will draw you in, eager to read, and curious to learn more. But all too often, it\u2019s the scandalous headlines that stir the news cycle, stretch the truth, and tell a fraction of the story. These are the headlines that spread like wildfire on Twitter, outraging thousands, and leaving the real story lost on the cutting room floor. We see it happen all the time.\n\nJust this week, a full-blown scandal erupted because of a headline like this, \u201cTrump Had Deal With Scotland Airport That Sent Flight Crews to His Resort.\u201d\n\nThe true story gets lost because some firmly believe the president ordered the rooms at his resort be filled with Air Force aircrew members. But the truth is more important than the headline.\n\nAIR FORCE DEFENDS STOPOVER: TRUMP'S SCOTLAND HOTEL WAS THE CHEAPEST AROUND\n\nAs a pilot in the Air Guard and veteran of the United States Air Force, I am quite familiar with Department of Defense travel guidelines, so let me set this record straight.\n\nWhen aircrews need to stay overnight somewhere, the location is generally based on mission requirements and government fuel contract availability. In many cases, that location comes down from Scott Air Force Base in a planning cell called the Tactical Air Control Center (TACC).\n\nIf a crew is given the option of picking an overnight location, there are strict guidelines as to where that location can be, like taking into account fuel availability and crew rest times among a host of other variables. This also sheds light on why an entire cell of the military is dedicated to planning such logistics.\n\nAnother fun fact is that European cities have \u201cquiet hours,\u201d which limits the timeframes for when a jet like a C-17 or KC-135 can depart or arrive, thus limiting options available to our aircrew members even further.\n\nAircrew members are given a per diem for expenses and quite honestly, they have the right to pick any location and food choices that will honor their allocated amount. Per diem sums cover the cost of the hotel room and a spending allowance on site.\n\nMany questions go into making the decision on where to stay during a mission and many times these decisions are made by the aircrew or planning cell based on availability, and it is absolutely their right to do so.\n\nIt\u2019s not a scandal for aircrews to stay at a nice hotel like the Trump Turnberry. And it\u2019s not unethical so long as they honor the government rate, which is not always a given because as a private company, they can choose to honor it or not.\n\nFor everyone still spinning up over this story, I have a spoiler alert: not everyone in an aircrew will be happy with every accommodation, whether it\u2019s a Trump hotel or a cheap motel down the road.\n\nI preferred the nicer places during my time in the Air Force, but some I flew with preferred to pocket the extra money.\n\nIt\u2019s a choice, and it\u2019s that of our service members to make \u2013 not the firing squads on Twitter. And this choice is in the regulation written by our Department of Defense.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nOur servicemen and women work harder than most of us could imagine, and so why shouldn\u2019t we give them the choice to determine their overnight stays within the DOD guidelines.\n\nTo those who continue to use the military as pawns, particularly while exhibiting zero interest in finding out the truth and the actual rules, please do us all a favor and just stop.\n\nTo the Air Force leadership bending to the pressure from the media by opening \u201cstudies\u201d into the issue, I implore you to knock it off. If no law was broken--and it does not appear there was--the Air Force needs to defend their service members. End of story.\n\nTheir statement should simply refer people to the applicable regulations and then they should go back to focusing on how to increase pilot retention and morale, among other deeply concerning challenges facing the United States Air Force right now.\n\nWe cannot continue to let the headlines dictate the true story or scare us into cowering to the uproar.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTake the time to learn the facts and decide for yourself.\n\nFor me, I know where I stand. If I were flying overseas today and the Trump Turnberry was an option for my overnight, you can bet all your savings I\u2019d be staying there with my crew. Because that would be my choice to make, not the Twitter trends.", "description": "As a pilot in the Air Guard and veteran of the United States Air Force, I am quite familiar with Department of Defense travel guidelines, so let me set the record straight on something that recently generated a lot of headlines.", "authors": ["Adam Kinzinger", "Adam Kinzinger Was First Sworn Into The U.
