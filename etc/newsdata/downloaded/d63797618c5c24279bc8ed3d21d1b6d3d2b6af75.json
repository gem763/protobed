Dejan Joveljic - Red Star Belgrade/Eintracht Frankfurt\n\nFrankfurt's replacement for Luka Jovic is considered a hot prospect, but is only just settling into life in the Bundesliga.\n\nTwo appearances so far, and just four substitute appearances for previous club Red Star and Serbia under-21's mean he's still got a lot to prove.\n\n19. Rodrygo - Santos/Real Madrid\n\nA debut goal. Comparisons with the great Cristiano Ronaldo . There's little not to like already.\n\nReal Madrid's latest diamond in the rough has got off to the perfect start at the Bernabeu, scoring just 93 seconds into his first appearance for the club.\n\nPlenty of promise. But considering that's the only game he's played (plus four for former club Santos), he's not this years winner.\n\n18. Andriy Lunin - Leganes/Real Madrid\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe 20-year-old Ukrainian stopper has his international form to thank for being in the final 20 nominees.\n\nLunin made just seven appearances for Leganes last season before a summer switch to Madrid - where he has been packed out on loan to Real Valladolid.\n\nHe's yet to make an appearance for them, but after collecting the Golden Glove award in Ukraine's under-20 World Cup triumph in summer, he made his senior debut in September and is one to watch.\n\n17. Ansu Fati - Barcelona\n\nTo even be included on this list is an achievement in itself for 16-year-old Ansu Fati.\n\nThe Barcelona prodigy is the youngest contender from the remaining 20 hopefuls, and it's no real surprise given the scintillating start he has made to his Nou Camp career.\n\nHis goal at Osasuna in August made him Barca's youngest-ever goalscorer - quite a feat when you consider Lionel Messi was over a year older than Fati when he got off the mark for the Catalans.\n\nHe followed that up with a goal and an assist in his first start against Valencia and looks to possess some serious talent.\n\nBut given he has made just six career appearances, the Golden Boy award will have to pass him by on this occasion.\n\n16. Alphonso Davies - Bayern Munich\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIt's still early days for the Canadian teenager, but he has showed plenty of promise in the Bundesliga since his move from the Vancouver Whitecaps in January.\n\nDavies, 18, has made 10 appearances for the German champions since, and featured in his countries CONCACAF Gold Cup campaign during the summer.\n\nBayern are keeping him waiting for his first start however, although you sense he won't be waiting long.\n\n15. Kang-In Lee - Valencia\n\nThe Valencia midfielder is proving a hit at the Mestalla after making his La Liga debut at the beginning of the year - becoming the first Asian league debutant for the Spanish club.\n\nLee, 18, made a total of 11 appearances over the campaign, and was included in South Korea's team for the under-20 World Cup, where he won the award for Player of the Tournament.\n\nSix appearances have followed for Valencia this season, including a brief cameo against Chelsea in the Champions League last month.\n\n14. Moise Kean - Juventus/Everton\n\n(Image: Everton FC via Getty Images)\n\nA few eyebrows were raised when Juventus sold Kean to the Toffees in the summer for a fairly modest \u00a327.5m.\n\nThe 19-year-old looked onto great things in Serie A after scoring six goals in just 13 league appearances.\n\nCoupled with that were his impressive performances for Italy, whom he scored on his debut for.\n\nHe was demoted from their squad last month however after upsetting boss Roberto Mancini, and is yet to be selected again.\n\nBut he's been ever-present for Everton since his move, and can reclaim his international spot if he is able to move his club up the table.\n\n13. Ferran Torres - Valencia\n\nValencia's own golden boy may not win the FIFA award, but he's on the right track.\n\nAt 19 he's already establishing himself as a key member of the first-team, playing over 30 times this year and scoring three goals.\n\nBut it was his work in the under-19 European Championship with Spain that really caught the eye in summer, as he netted both goals in the final against Portugal, and making his way into the team of the tournament as a result.\n\n12. Vinicius Junior - Real Madrid\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe 'future of Real Madrid ' as boss Zinedine Zidane once hailed him, has endured a difficult start to life in Spain.\n\nThere was plenty of expectation on the 18-year-old's shoulders when he joined in a \u00a338 million deal in the summer of 2018.\n\nAnd he has had his fair share of action since the turn of the year, but could do little to arrest the slump his side suffered last season.\n\nOnly three goals for his side this year though has raised a few question marks, and he was left out of Real's recent win over Granada.\n\nHis time will come - but probably not until Gareth Bale has moved on.\n\n11. Nicolo Zaniolo - Roma\n\nIt seems Roma fans have been waiting for a young prince to adore since club legend Francesco Totti hung up his boots.\n\nAnd in Zaniolo, they finally have one.\n\nThe 20-year-old has been ever-present since making his debut in September 2018, and made a big contribution to Roma's attempt for the top four, scoring five goals in the back half of last season.\n\nLike Totti he's got a bit of a bad boy streak, and has collected eight bookings in his last 16 games for club and country.\n\nIn fact his senior debut for Italy would probably have come earlier had he not been booted out of the squad by boss Roberto Mancini for turning up late to a meeting - along with Moise Kean.\n\nWhich is perhaps why he hasn't invaded the top 10.\n\n10. Donyell Malen - PSV\n\n(Image: SIPA USA/PA Images)\n\nLet go by Arsenal for just \u00a3200k two seasons ago, Malen is now making waves across Europe for his prolific form.\n\nDespite only being in October, the 20-year-old has already banged 16 goals for PSV in all competitions this season, and alerted interest from none other than his old club!\n\nHe now has 22 goals in 31 appearances since the turn of the year, as well as grabbing his first international debut on his first cap.\n\nNow worth \u00a350m - Arsenal must be kicking themselves.\n\n9. Erling Braut Haaland - Red Bull Salzburg\n\nThe RB Salzburg striker has set himself his first career goal - to be better than his dad!\n\nAlfe-Inge Haaland was perhaps unfortunately best known for being on the receiving end of a Roy Keane tackle that ended his playing days - but enjoyed a respectable top flight career beforehand.\n\nSon Erling is now following in his dad's footsteps - at least as far as being a professional is concerned.\n\nHe made headlines last month after scoring a hat-trick on his Champions League debut - becoming the third youngest teenager to do so.\n\nIt was his third treble this season, and he now has 15 goals in 10 games for his club (including one at Anfield against Liverpool ) - which have followed his nine-goal haul in one match for Norway at the under-20 world cup in summer.\n\nSmells like a goal machine to me.\n\n8. Mason Mount- Derby/Chelsea\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nFew would have predicted Mount would have had quite the impact on the Premier League that he's had so far this season.\n\nPerforming in the Championship is one thing - and his displays for Derby deserve great credit after they narrowly missed on play-off promotion.\n\nFrank Lampard has been rewarded for his faith in the youngster, who has averaged a goal every other game in his Premier League career so far.\n\nFour strikes in eight games is a decent return, earning him an England call-up - and there should be more to come for both club and country.\n\n7. Gianluigi Donnarumma - AC Milan\n\nYou almost take Milan's no.1 for granted now he's such an established pro.\n\nHe's now into his fifth season between the sticks at the San Siro, and still only 20 years old.\n\nIf the Golden Boy award took into account longevity he'd probably get it.\n\nMilan's fortunes over that time have improved too, gradually moving up the table to finish just outside the Champions League spots by a point to rivals Inter last season.\n\nAlthough their latest campaign has not got off to the best of starts, and Donnarumma has already been on the losing side four times.\n\n6. Phil Foden - Man City\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nEngland's next talisman? Possibly.\n\nBut he needs to get in the Man City team on a regular basis first.\n\nThat chance looks to be on the horizon with David Silva leaving the Etihad at the end of the season.\n\nThe fact Pep Guardiola refused to let him leave on loan shows how much he thinks of Foden.\n\nAnd despite only playing a bit part last season, largely from the bench, he's still won a treble at 19, and that's pretty cool.\n\n5. Matteo Guendouzi - Arsenal\n\nLittle was known about Guendouzi when he first arrived at the Emirates.\n\nWith Arsenal fans still crying out for a Patrick Vieira-type midfielder all these years later, Guendouzi's gangly frame and afro haircut was perhaps not what they had envisaged.\n\nBut he's fit in nicely at the Gunners and shown real promise in a side that lacks significant leadership.\n\nThere's no doubt the Frenchman is still raw in terms of his talent, but after helping the Gunners to the Europa League final, he makes the top five.\n\n4. Kai Havertz - Bayer Leverkusen\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nArguably one of the most exciting youngsters in world football at the moment.\n\nHavertz has attracted interest from some of Europe's elite, with Liverpool and Man Utd among those keen on the winger.\n\nAs with most promising German youngsters however, it seems the 20-year-old will take the tried and tested step to Bayern Munich at some point in the near future.\n\nAnd his 20 goals last season are enough to tell you they'll be getting some player.\n\n3. Jadon Sancho - Borussia Dortmund\n\nEngland's talented winger has built quite the career for himself after switching youth team football to take a risk on cracking the Bundesliga.\n\nSancho delivered once again for Dortmund last season, playing a part in 28 goals for his side across the campaign.\n\nNations League disappointment with England hasn't stopped him in his tracks this season either, as he has had a hand in nine goals in as many appearances.\n\nHe's been around a while now, but it's often easy to forget he's still only 19.\n\n2. Joao Felix - Benfica/Atletico Madrid\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWhen one of Europe's big guns forks out \u00a3113m for a 19-year-old, the rest of the world tends to sit up and take notice.\n\nAlthough, practically everyone in football was already aware of the talents of Joao Felix following his breakthrough season with Benfica.\n\nAfter scoring 15 goals for the Portuguese side, Atletico moved to make Felix the fifth most-expensive transfer of all time, and second most-expensive teenager behind Kylian Mbappe.\n\nHis form led to an international debut at the Nations League finals with Portugal, and he has already netted three times for Atletico since his move.\n\nAnd he admitted his stark rise has helped in other departments, stating: \"The success helped me a lot with the girls.\"\n\n\"On social media they often send me photos, even naked.\"\n\nLiving the dream.\n\n1. Matthijs de Ligt - Ajax/Juventus\n\nWhat a year it has been for last year's winner of the award.\n\nAn imperious season with Ajax saw them just one Lucas Moura hat-trick away from their first Champions League final in over two decades.\n\nDe Ligt, 20, was at the heart of that, as well as Holland's run to the UEFA Nations League finals where he scored against England en route to the last two.\n\nHis form prompted Juventus to shell out \u00a367m for his services in summer, fighting off interest from PSG and Barcelona in the process.\n\nAnd he's now sitting top of the Serie A with his new club.\n\nFor all that the Dutchman more than deserves to retain his trophy. Bravo, Matthijs.", "description": "The award is given to the player under the age of 21 who has had the best calendar year at one of Europe's elite clubs", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Icon Sport Via Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Everton Fc Via Getty Images", "Sipa Usa Pa Images", "Reuters", "Pa", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20587480.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1172752058.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
