And he'll call on his rivals to do more than just wave around an arsenal of policy proposals.\n\n\u201cThe vice president will argue we need more than just plans \u2014 we need action. We need progress,\u201d a senior Biden campaign official said Thursday. \u201cThis race is not just about plans, it\u2019s about getting things done for people.\u201d\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN FLIES ANTI-SOCIALISM BANNER OVER DEBATE SITE\n\nThe comments came during a briefing with reporters on the sidelines of the debate in Houston, and they amounted to an implicit swipe at surging Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is best known for her reams of plans. The Massachusetts senator published yet another of those plans on Thursday morning, focused on Social Security.\n\nThe dynamic between the two rivals could be the main attraction, as this is the first time Warren has been on the same stage with Biden in this Democratic primary cycle. With the criteria tightened for this, the third debate matchup among the Dem candidates, only the 10 top-polling contenders will appear, as opposed to the field being split in half for two consecutive nights of debates.\n\nThe debate is a clear opportunity for Warren to build on the momentum her campaign has experienced in recent weeks. But Biden, grappling with sustained critical media coverage over a string of verbal flubs and a narrative from his left flank that he's not progressive enough, is determined to convince voters there's more to his candidacy than just the \"electability\" factor.\n\nAccording to the campaign, he'll talk about the \u201cmeaningful change\u201d he helped pursue while vice president under Barack Obama, and his plans to build on that success.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll talk about his substantive record,\u201d the official said, touting his victories against the National Rifle Association (NRA) and support for the Violence Against Women Act.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden has been at the forefront of progressive change,\u201d the official said.\n\nWARREN UNVEILS SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN\n\nThe campaign also said Biden will \u201creject the premise that the ideas he is putting forward are incremental.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe there is a false dichotomy in this race between candidates who are supposedly the liberal revolutionaries and those who are for incremental change,\u201d another official said.\n\nAs for his strategy for the debate stage, the campaign made clear that Biden \u201cis not in this race to attack other Democrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been very clear about that,\u201d one official said. \u201cOur hope and aim is that this will be a substantive policy discussion.\u201d\n\nThe official added, though, that Biden \u201chas not shied away from drawing a contrast between his health care plan and Medicare-for-all \u2014 specifically the cost, in another apparent swipe at Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not in the race to attack other Democrats but he is not going to shy away from having a meaningful conversation,\u201d the official said.\n\nDespite being the consistent frontrunner in the crowded Democratic primary field, Biden has grappled with critical media coverage and general frustration with his candidacy from the left. His campaign appearances have also been marred by some verbal slips in recent weeks, while some top Democrats have questioned his handling of his own record.\n\nFormer Obama adviser David Axelrod recently accused him of distorting his record on the Iraq War.\n\nBiden famously weathered a rhetorical broadside from Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., during the first primary debate, in connection with his past stance on desegregation busing.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, sought to capitalize on the debate by hammering their message that the party is drifting into socialism.\n\n\"The socialists are in town today. They want the government to tell you what job you can have, what health care you can have, and what school you can go to. They want to control every aspect of your life, and they want taxpayers to pay for it,\" Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in Houston on Thursday. \"That's not what America is about.\"", "description": "The Biden campaign previewed its\u00a0debate strategy for Thursday night by making at least two things clear: The former vice president will reject efforts to cast him as an incremental moderate.
