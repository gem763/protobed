(AP) - Just because Kyle Shanahan didn\u2019t join his 49ers players mud-sliding in celebration after shutting out the Redskins didn\u2019t mean he enjoyed beating his old team any less.\n\nShanahan, who served as Washington\u2019s offensive coordinator under his father, Mike, from 2010-13, celebrated the occasion by giving his dad the game ball after the 9-0 victory Sunday. Kyle has made little secret of his hard feelings over how things went working for owner Dan Snyder and president Bruce Allen.\n\nHe lost his only previous visit to FedEx Field as a head coach in 2017, his first season in San Francisco. With a much better team this time, Shanahan didn\u2019t waste his opportunity to hand the Redskins another loss in a season full of them.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s a little more sensitive to things that involve your family,\u201d Shanahan said after the 49ers improved to 6-0 by beating the Redskins 9-0. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m always a little more sensitive to this because of what I went through with my dad here, and that\u2019s why it was nice to get the win. But it definitely had nothing to do with the game, has nothing to do with the score.\n\n\u201cBut you always want to take care of things the right way when you\u2019re bothered by how some things happened to a family member.\u201d\n\nThe Shanahans were fired after the 2013 season, a year after quarterback Robert Griffin III reinjured his right knee on this same field. Shanahan said \u201ceveryone knows how the field always is\u201d at Washington\u2019s home stadium, which was just one of many things to go wrong during his time there.\n\nDuring the week, Kyle said working with his dad and other good coaches were the best parts of his Redskins tenure and that \u201ceverything else\u201d was the worst part. His players knew how badly he wanted to win this game.\n\n\u201cWe were aware,\u201d tight end George Kittle said. \u201cIt was a game we wanted to win for him and Mike Shanahan, and it was really fun that we could get that for him.\u201d\n\nKittle said \u201cit was pretty special\u201d that Kyle gave his dad the game ball. Shanahan tried to de-emphasize history after the Redskins fell to 1-6.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in a number of buildings and not all of it always ends good,\u201d he said. \u201cIt had nothing to do with the game.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Just because Kyle Shanahan didn't join his 49ers players mud-sliding in celebration after shutting out the Redskins didn't mean he enjoyed beating his old team any less.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Whyno"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/49ers_redskins_football_71259_c0-179-4296-2685_s1200x700.jpg?ee0d0e52ea31db6725ce76977fe867d2b08c597e", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
