But she didn't confront him until learning that he had also made female crew members uncomfortable with his persistent flirting. During their showdown at the cocktail party, Angie told Jess: 'You made me feel very uncomfortable at the photo shoot. I said I wanted fun, but I feel like you took it too far. 'I will never allow a man to come in and f**k with my sisterhood. Never. 'I feel like you think this is a joke, and that really annoys me. You never talk about me as a person. You always just talk about me as a piece of meat.' 'I don't trust you and I'm sorry, you're gonna have to leave': Angie scolded Jess for being a creep, telling him he 'took [things] too far' during their group date As Jess interrupted to apologise for 'acting inappropriately', Angie snapped: 'I really don't believe a word that you say. 'I don't trust you and I'm sorry, you're gonna have to leave.' After packing his bags and being driven away in the limousine, Jess denied any wrongdoing. 'Apparently I was a bit crude to her on the photo shoot. That's bulls**t,' he said. 'Apparently that was too sexualising. I don't know. Obviously, it's just a different of opinion. I know deep down nothing happened.' He then added: 'I'm going back to Noosa to find the love of my life in a dirty, dingy nightclub.'\n\nIn a statement to 10 Daily, Jess said he meant 'no disrespect' to Angie or the crew, and apologised for causing any offence.\n\nHe said: 'It was not my intention to bring the Noosa Council or Noosa people into disrepute. I had the opportunity to find love on this show and I went for it.\n\n'I must admit, I'm a flirtatious guy, but I meant no disrespect to Angie or the crew. I sincerely apologise if I caused offence.'\n\nToo far: During a farmyard-themed photo shoot on Thursday's episode, Jess was dressed as the backside of a horse when he 'joked' that Angie was going to 'ride' him. He later positioned his head next to Angie's bottom and proceeded to poke his tongue out and make rude gestures\n\nHe was less apologetic in an interview with News Corp, in which he insisted his words had been 'totally taken out of context'.\n\n'It was all just jest, in the moment-type behaviour,' he added. 'I never said anything in a derogatory-type, insensitive way towards [Angie].\n\n'People forget, we're filming TV here. I don\u2019t know if you've noticed but their ratings are through the roof because of this thing.'\n\nDisgusting: In another cringeworthy moment, he brazenly told Angie, 'Don't mind me if I get some wandering fingers, alright?'\n\nMeanwhile, Jess is now under investigation for a potential breach of conduct as a result of his behaviour the dating show.\n\nNoosa Mayor Tony Wellington issued a statement on Thursday saying that Jess does not reflect Noosa Council or the town's community values.\n\n'Cr Glasgow did not seek approval from myself and I only found out about his involvement after the show had been recorded,' Wellington added.\n\n'He's a dead set f**king womaniser!' Jess' behaviour didn't go unnoticed in the mansion, with the other male contestants labeling him 'sleazy' and 'inappropriate'\n\nMe Wellington also told Ben Fordham on 2GB radio that he found Jess' behaviour 'difficult to watch'.\n\n'He accepts the fact that he made some errors of judgment, he accepts the fact that he will now be referred to the independent assessor and he takes full responsibility of his action, but I am not sure he is fully aware of the long term repercussions,' he said.\n\nWhen Fordham asked what Jess was like in a workplace setting, the Mayor replied: 'He is one of our more unusual councillors, I\u2019ll put it that way.'", "description": "Local politician Jess Glasgow was sent home on Thursday's episode of The Bachelorette, after Angie Kent confronted him over his inappropriate behaviour.", "authors": ["Mark Brook", "Jo Scrimshire For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/13/19537614-0-image-a-9_1570709011676.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
