REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\nTrudeau, one of the world\u2019s most prominent progressive politicians, struggled to overcome the effects of two domestic scandals. His Liberals only won 156 seats, a decrease of 21, preliminary results showed.\n\nHe now looks set to govern with the left-leaning New Democrats, who have 24 seats. Together the two parties can muster a majority 180 seats in the 338-seat House of Commons.\n\nMinority governments in Canada rarely last more than 2 1/2 years. Although the New Democrats lost 16 seats, leader Jagmeet Singh is now in a good position to press for action on priorities such as more social spending and increased action on climate change.\n\nOne senior Liberal also noted that many legislators needed to serve for another two years to meet the six-year requirement for a Parliamentary pension.\n\n\u201cThat gives us a pretty free hand for that period,\u201d said the Liberal, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter. Asked whether Trudeau would reach out to Singh soon, the Liberal said \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nThe New Democrats struck deals to help keep Liberal minority governments in power from 1972-1974 and in 2005.[L2N277069]\n\nThe Canadian dollar held near a three-month high, although some investors worried about the fiscal implications of the Singh\u2019s influence on policy.\n\nTrudeau barely mentioned the loss of his majority, telling supporters that he had \u201ca clear mandate\u201d for a progressive agenda and more action to combat global warming.\n\nThis is unlikely to please the western provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, which cast out every Liberal legislator amid anger over what the energy industry sees as overly stringent environmental rules.\n\nThe most prominent victim was Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, one of Trudeau\u2019s top cabinet members.\n\nThe election was also a disappointment for Andrew Scheer, leader of the opposition Conservatives, who had sought a majority. Although the Conservatives won the popular vote, they only gained 25 seats, ending the night with 122.\n\nScheer said he would continue to lead the party, but the result looks set to reopen questions about his future. Even before the election, some in the party were speculating about a leadership challenge if he lost.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hung onto power after an election on Monday that saw his government reduced to a minority, but aides predicted he would be able to govern for two years without many problems.", "authors": ["David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443723551&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0W5-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
