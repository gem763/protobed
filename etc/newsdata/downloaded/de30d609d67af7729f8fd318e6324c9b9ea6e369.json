Other than that my tiny New York studio was a small white box. The interior came alive because of the art.\u201d\n\n\u201cArt creates the impression of a more valuable home. If you think about a beautifully designed home with strong architecture, you can appreciate it for what it is, but without art it\u2019s not finished. It\u2019s missing an important component. Art rounds out the impression of living there,\u201d said Theo Adamstein, a sales associate with TTR Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\n\nArt can enhance the value of the house but a real estate agent can\u2019t pinpoint a number or percentage.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that,\u201d Adamstein said. \u201cYou can\u2019t say by how much because that implies there\u2019s a formula and if you spend a certain amount then the house goes up a certain amount. Art embellishes a home, it adds to a home\u2019s character, it adds color and rhythm and makes it more interesting than it may otherwise be, and that absolutely adds value.\u201d\n\n\n\nChris and Beverly With have packed their Logan Circle condominium with works on paper. \u201cNo space goes untouched,\" Beverly With said. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nArt in homes\n\nChris and Beverly With live in a two-floor Logan Circle condominium packed with works on paper. Hundreds of framed pictures plus sculptures cover every square inch of wall space.\n\n\u201cNo space goes untouched. The guest bathroom is our photography gallery,\u201d Beverly With said. A print hangs on the small area below the wall cutout between the kitchen and dining room inches above the dining room floor. The walls lining two staircases \u2014 one from the entry door to the main living area and a second from the living room up to the bedrooms \u2014 are covered chock-a-block.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want empty space so there\u2019s no place we don\u2019t put art. If you want to find a spot, you will. In the kitchen or bathroom or wherever. Nature abhors a vacuum,\u201d Chris With said.\n\nPaula Amt, owner of Framesmith DC and a collector, lives in a 400-square-foot space. \u201cMy art is hung floor to ceiling. I minimize the space between works to fit in another piece because I want to see what I can see,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if your home is large or small, if you rent or own. Don\u2019t stop collecting because you think you don\u2019t have any more room. Just make the spaces between the pieces smaller,\u201d she said.\n\nAnthony Gyepi-Garbrah and Desir\u00e9e Venn Frederic\u2019s home in Northeast Washington\u2019s Trinidad neighborhood is distinguished by dozens of paintings and prints hanging salon-style on the walls and doors, sculptures lining the floors, and antique furnishings all around.\n\nThe Withs' dining room.

(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cArt in our home makes a place for us and provides benefits. It enhances our design perspective, it helps bring our attention to certain parts of the apartment, it provides accents, invokes emotion and adds clarity,\u201d Gyepi-Garbrah said.\n\nTimothy Johnson is a local artist with a show, \u201cFables of Decapitation: I knew I would die long ago,\u201d at Touchstone Gallery through Oct. 27. His home and art studio are one and they\u2019re small. Paintings adorn the apartment walls and a nine-foot-long ledge on the wall next to his easel is dedicated to his work in progress. \u201cI prop up the paintings I\u2019m working on so I can see them better and make changes,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe family cat relaxes in the Withs' bedroom. Nature abhors a vacuum,\u201d Chris With said. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nArt should challenge you\n\nRobert Brown, the other co-owner of Gallery Neptune & Brown and a collector, recommends collecting for joy, not investment. \u201cBuy pieces you can\u2019t live without. Something that gives you pleasure and a thrill every time you look at it,\u201d he said.\n\nYou and your partner\u2019s tastes may differ but that shouldn\u2019t create tension, he said. Instead celebrate and broaden your assemblage with works that appeal to both of you. \u201cBuying art isn\u2019t a competition,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWhen you start buying, accept that your taste will evolve and you may not like a piece in 10 years. When that time comes, sell or give it away,\u201d Chris With said.\n\n\u201cBuy what you love. That\u2019s the most important thing. Then the art will move around all your real estate,\u201d Neptune said.\n\nGo to galleries and museums around town.\n\nAsk questions and ask to see work not in view. Galleries have rooms in the back with files holding many pieces. Owners will work with your budget and show you art in a range of prices. You can buy on credit and often on installment. Sometimes you can take a piece home \u201con approval\u201d to see how you like it.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed or shy. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to talk about art in a way that makes you feel comfortable and teaches you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people approach art as decoration as opposed to collecting. That\u2019s a short-term solution. Collecting art is long term. It doesn\u2019t make sense to waste your money on the short term. Take a little longer to decide what you love and to save money to buy it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPeople will come in and tell us they have a spot in mind. \u2018I have a spot behind my couch,\u2019 they say. A year later, they move or get a new couch. Especially in Washington because moving is common. Instead think about what you love so that when you move you want to take it along,\u201d Neptune said.\n\n\u201cMany people fill their living spaces with sentimental mementos rather than fine art,\u201d Larry Kirkland, an artist and collector, said. Sentimental can be fine, but it can also mean insipid prints, anodyne landscapes, calendar still lifes and pastoral photos.\n\n\u201cIf you really are an art collector some of your art may bring up a memory but you buy a piece because it challenges you emotionally and intellectually,\u201d he said.\n\nEven a living room table holds a small collection of sculptural art pieces owned by the Withs.

Chris With emphasized that \"placement has to be attractive.\" (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to hang\n\nNo room should be omitted from your art display, but there\u2019s no map to show where to hang. It\u2019s intuitive and what looks right to your eye.\n\n\u201cYet placement has to be attractive. It has to have a sense of proportion. You can\u2019t put it up higgledy-piggledy,\u201d Chris With said.\n\nWall color shouldn\u2019t fade into the art. \u201cYou want the art work to stand out, not blend into the background,\u201d Brown said.\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t look good, move it. \u201cWe know people who agonize. They say, \u2018I could never hang art myself.' They worry about putting a hole in the wall. It\u2019s not a big deal to hammer a picture-hook hanger in the wall. Holes are easy to repair or you can hire a handyman,\u201d Chris With said.\n\n\u201cPeople are especially worried about making that first hole. Get over it. Hang the piece up. It\u2019s just a wall,\u201d Amt said. \u201cIf you\u2019re truly not allowed to make holes in the wall, there are ways to get around that with hanging systems that lay against the wall.\u201d\n\nArt is personal. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not just an investment in the artist or my collection. It is me being a custodian to a part of history. If everything goes well, that artifact will outlive me in perpetuity,\u201d Gyepi-Garbrah said.\n\nAdamstein said: \u201cHanging art on your walls is the most direct route to transforming a house into a home. It offers prospective buyers an immediate sense of homeyness.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article contained the wrong photos.\n\nPhotos by Bill O\u2019Leary.
