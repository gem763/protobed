South African travellers need a visitors visa - so they do not qualify for this form or applied travel exemptions.\n\nThe New Zealand travel authority details the form takes about 72-hours to process at a cost of between NZ$9 to NZ$12 ( about R86 to R115 at R9.59/NZ$).\n\nTravellers who are New Zealand citizens travelling on a New Zealand passport, or a foreign passport that has a New Zealand citizen endorsement, are an Australian citizen travelling on an Australian passport or hold a valid visa for New Zealand \u2014 including a Permanent Resident Visa do not need to fill in this NZeTA.\n\nMAPPED: A look at ETIAS - Europe's new travel requirement set to come into effect\n\nA similar security measure, the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) will also come into effect in 2021. Currently, individuals from the 57 countries do not require Schengen visas to visit countries in the European Union.\n\nHowever, with the arrival of ETIAS, it is likely that passport holders of these countries will require an ETIAS waiver to travel to Europe for the purposes of tourism, business or transit for a short 90 days stay in any 180-day period.", "description": "New Zealand has seen an influx of visitors and is tightening its security measures for travellers visiting from visa-free access countries.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8270/6f9afacb351844bf8db75246d5650c3f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
