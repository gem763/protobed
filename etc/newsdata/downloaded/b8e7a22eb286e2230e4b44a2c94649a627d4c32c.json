This week I discovered something new about them: You can zip two of them together.\n\nBuzzfeed pointed the idea out in a post this week, along with a number of other great ideas, many of which we\u2019ve covered over the years.\n\nThe way it works is super simple: Just place a larger item in one bag, and then flip the second one inside out. In doing so, you\u2019ll give yourself the ability to zip the two bags together, essentially making one massive ziplock bag.\n\nObviously your frankenbag is going to be a bit less structurally sound than a single ziplock bag will be on its own, and depending on what you\u2019re putting in it might be a bit problematic to both seal and open.\n\nThat said, if you need a bit of extra space in that freezer bag for a larger piece of meat or for another item (the original Reddit poster sealed a computer keyboard), then it can be great to know that sealing two together in an option.", "description": "Freezer bags are great for storing all kinds of things.
