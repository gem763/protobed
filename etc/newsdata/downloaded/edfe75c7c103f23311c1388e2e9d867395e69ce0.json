(AP) - The sheer dominance of Kansas State in Chris Klieman\u2019s debut can perhaps be summarized best by the fact that the new coach hopes to see his defense on the field more this weekend.\n\nYes, you read that right.\n\nThe Wildcats held the ball for more than 41 minutes in their 49-14 whitewashing of Nicholls State last weekend, and that meant a mere 20 plays for the defense. That makes any evaluation of the guys on that side of the ball rather difficult, to say nothing of new coordinator Scott Hazelton.\n\n\u201cWe need to play more snaps,\u201d Klieman said ahead of Saturday\u2019s game against Bowling Green, the last tuneup for Kansas State before an early test at Mississippi State.\n\n\u201cObviously you don\u2019t want to play more,\u201d Klieman admitted, \u201cbut we need to play more to have a better evaluation of some guys. I just know there were a lot of technique errors.\u201d\n\nIt must have taken a discerning eye to see them.\n\nThe Wildcats committed just two penalties and had no turnovers while being so efficient on offense they once marched nearly the length of the field without a pass. On defense, they made enough plays to keep Nicholls from ever getting into rhythm, despite the Colonels returning the bulk of their playmakers.\n\n\u201cAt times we got a little bored,\u201d Kansas State defensive end Wyatt Hubert said, \u201cbut that\u2019s a good problem to have with the offense being on the field for so long.\u201d\n\nBowling Green didn\u2019t have much trouble in its opener, either. The Falcons roared to a 46-3 win over Morgan State in a successful debut for coach Scot Loeffler. The 43-point margin was the third-largest for a new Bowling Green coach, and the 620 yards of total offense were the most since the Falcons set the school record of 725 in 2015.\n\nOn the flip side, the Falcons held Morgan State to just 70 yards of total offense.\n\nLoeffler isn\u2019t oblivious to the fact that Kansas State and Morgan State have nothing in common but the \u201cState\u201d in their names, though. He knows the trip to Manhattan is another challenge entirely.\n\n\u201cWhenever the talent is a little bit different or equal, every play matters. We need to be on our game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s different. Crowd noise is different. Playing in a tough, hard, loud environment with a team that is extremely disciplined. Our kids will have to have a sense of urgency.\u201d\n\nPOUND THE ROCK\n\nKansas State ran for 361 yards against Nicholls, getting rushing touchdowns from five different players. The ground-based attack came despite the Wildcats having no players with experience returning from last season.\n\n\u201cCoach Klieman and the rest of the coaches did an unbelievable job of recruiting,\u201d said running back James Gilbert, a transfer from Ball State.\n\nCULTURE CHECK\n\nLoeffler has always admired retired Kansas State coach Bill Snyder, whether during his years at Michigan, Florida, Temple and Auburn or his stint in the NFL. He doesn\u2019t think the change in coaches has changed much at Kansas State, either.\n\n\u201cYou can feel on the tape the culture left by Coach Snyder,\u201d he said, \u201cand you can see the same culture brought in by Coach Klieman.\u201d\n\nFALCON DEFENSE\n\nBowling Green allowed just 24 yards passing to Morgan State, and the 70 yards total was the fewest since allowing 65 to Eastern Michigan in 2013. The Falcons allowed no drives longer than six plays or 25 yards, and it was their best showing in terms of points since a shutout in 2015.\n\nSLEDGEHAMMERS\n\nKansas State allows its trio of captains to give out sledgehammers to deserving players after each game. Defensive back Denzel Goolsby gave his to the scout team last week, while offensive lineman Adam Holtorf gave his to the backup O-line. Quarterback Skylar Thompson gave his to defensive back Jonathan Alexander for his strip, fumble recovery and touchdown return.\n\nNEW ON NEW\n\nBoth coaches said there is a challenge in preparing for a team with a new coach, though at least the playing field is even in that respect.\n\n\u201cIn a blowout win like they had it\u2019s hard to say, \u2018Well, this is what they do,\u2019\u201d Klieman explained. \u201cThere is some carry-over from what we\u2019ve seen from their coordinators at other schools. It\u2019ll be a work in progress.\u201d\n\nGAZING AHEAD\n\nThis is Bowling Green\u2019s only scheduled game against a Power Give school, while the Wildcats will be trying to avoid looking ahead to next weekend\u2019s showdown against the Bulldogs in Starkville.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The sheer dominance of Kansas State in Chris Klieman's debut can perhaps be summarized best by the fact that the new coach hopes to see his defense on the field more this weekend.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Skretta"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/nicholls_st_kansas_st_football_92559_c0-190-4552-2844_s1770x1032.jpg?abfc50b9d369b4c65e43e5d8c79ab7636e715119", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
