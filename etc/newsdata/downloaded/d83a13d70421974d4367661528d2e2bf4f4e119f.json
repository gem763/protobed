Holbrook heads home a winner\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nSt Helens have completely dominated Super League for the two full seasons that coach Justin Holbrook has been in charge - but hadn\u2019t landed one of the two major trophies before tonight.\n\nThey failed to make both finals in 2018 and stumbled to a shock Challenge Cup final defeat to Warrington at Wembley.\n\nThis season the 16 points clear they finished at the top of the table was a record in British rugby league history.\n\nAnd Holbrook finally got his hands on the big one as his talented side produced an accomplished performance on the Old Trafford stage.\n\nThe Australian now heads home to take charge of NRL strugglers Gold Coast Titans and will forever be remembered fondly on the St Helens terraces.\n\n2. Phenomenal Thompson crucial again\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nLuke Thompson was the star of St Helens\u2019 semi-final win over Wigan with a destructive 54-minute spell - and he bettered that at Old Trafford.\n\nThe England front rower - now widely regarded as one of the best props on either side of the world - was again titanic for Holbrook\u2019s side.\n\nHim and Alex Walmsley helped Saints dominate the opening 25 minutes, and Thompson remained on the field well beyond that, constantly punching holes in the Salford defence.\n\nWhen he was eventually forced off in the 72nd minute he received a huge ovation from the St Helens supporters - and was then crowned Harry Sunderland Trophy winner as man of the match.\n\nThompson\u2019s battles with forwards from New Zealand, Tonga and Papua New Guinea for Great Britain this autumn will be fascinating.\n\n3. Red Devils must build on success\n\n(Image: Matt West/BPI/REX)\n\nSalford might have fallen short at the final hurdle, but their run to the Grand Final has been one of the feel-good stories of the last few seasons of Super League.\n\nRoared on by a huge travelling support, they have created memories for long suffering supporters and attracted countless new ones.\n\nThe trick for the club now is making the most of the interest this season has created for 2020 an beyond.\n\nIan Watson\u2019s team have offered a glimpse into the potential of the famous club, hopefully they can now fulfil that.\n\n4. Watson\u2019s quick change\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAs the Red Devils stormed to Old Trafford, the stock of their popular coach Ian Watson has continued to rise.\n\nThe former Salford half-back will now link up with Great Britain on this autumn\u2019s tour of New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, recognition that is richly deserved.\n\nHis attention to detail, man management skills and tactical know-how have been central to what his side has achieved this year.\n\nHe also provided the quickest change in Grand Final history by swapping the suit he walked his team out in to a tracksuit on the touchline before kick-off.\n\nIt said everything about his no-nonsense approach to the game.\n\n5. An unlikely cherry on top\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nOf all the ways to finish a Grand Final win, a 45-metre drop goal from a winger was hardly among the favourites.\n\nBut that\u2019s what Tommy Makinson produced as the clock ran down, much to the delight of his team-mates.\n\nThe Golden Boot holder produced the sweetest of connections at the Theatre of Dreams to add a final memory to St Helens\u2019 win.", "description": "Saints had to fight past underdogs Salford\u2019s gutsy effort to lift a first Super League title since 2014", "authors": ["Gareth Walker", "Image", "Pa", "Matt West Bpi Rex", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20567741.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_St-Helens-v-Salford-Red-Devils-Betfred-Super-League-Grand-Final-Old-Trafford.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
