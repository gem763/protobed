This is what Stress & worry have done to a 1950swomen & her body. In debt for the 1st time in my life after 5 yrs without my StatePension-hope you're proud of yourselves.\"\n\nYoland, from Staffordshire, added in an earlier tweet: \"Today I have gone through debt support with stepchange .... first time in my life I've EVER been in debt. I'm so poorly too .... just look at the state of me, my immune system blown to pieces through stress. I don't care who knows any more. BackTo60.\"\n\nCampaign group BackTo60 supported two women in a legal challenge against the Department of Work and Pensions in the High Court earlier this year, claiming that the rise in state pension age for women was unfair because it discriminated against those born in the 1950s.\n\nJulie Delve, 61, and Karen Glynn, 63, claimed the government had given insufficient notice of the changes so women could not alter their retirement planning.\n\nBut judges rejected the challenge in a ruling earlier this month, saying that while they were \"saddened\" by the stories of hardship, it was not an issue for the courts and the changes had been approved by parliament.\n\nIn a summary of the High Court's decision, the judges said: \"There was no direct discrimination on grounds of sex, because this legislation does not treat women less favourably than men in law. Rather it equalises a historic asymmetry between men and women and thereby corrects historic direct discrimination against men.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Backto60 lodged an application for permission to appeal the High Court's ruling.\n\nFollowing defeat at the High Court, it launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u00a372,000 to cover both the legal action and further campaigning.\n\nNo date for the appeal hearing has been set.", "description": "Yoland Howden, 65, demands politicians pay attention to how the stress of the higher retirement age change can wreak havoc on women's health", "authors": ["Ian Leonard"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20724701.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-yolandhowden4jpeg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
