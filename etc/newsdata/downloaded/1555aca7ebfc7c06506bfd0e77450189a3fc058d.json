Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called \u201cthe most fundamental betrayal of his oath of office.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe descriptions of the call provide the clearest indication to date that Trump sought to use the influence of his office to prod the leader of a country seeking American financial and diplomatic support to provide material that could aid in the president\u2019s reelection,\u201d The Post reported.\n\nThe whistleblower turned over what he knew to the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general who, The Post said, has \u201cassessed the whistleblower complaint as credible and a matter of such urgency that it should be disclosed to the relevant committees of Congress.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Trump spoke on the telephone to Mr. Zelensky in late July, the president knew that the Ukrainians were waiting for nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid that had been held up by the White House.\n\nSeveral days after the two presidents talked, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani \u201cmet with an aide to the Ukrainian president in Madrid and spelled out two specific cases he believed Ukraine should pursue,\u201d The Post said.\n\n\u201cOne was a probe of a Ukrainian gas tycoon who had Biden\u2019s son Hunter on his board,\u201d The Post also reported on its front page.\n\nThe front page stories ran under this headline: \u201cTrump said to have pressed Ukraine on Biden.\u201d Next to that was a related story headlined: \u201cGiuliani helped pressure Kiev to investigate Democrats\u2019 son.\u201d\n\nThe headlines tell the story: Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cUkraine call fuels impeachment take,\u201d followed by this subhead: \u201cConfident Trump On Defense Once More.\u201d\n\nThe lead story recalled an earlier time when Mr. Trump was bragging that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III report didn\u2019t lay a glove on him.\n\nThe day after Mr. Mueller testified on his final report, Mr. Trump \u201ccrowed \u2018no collusion\u2019 and claimed full vindication from accusations he had conspired with Russia in the 2016 election.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, the very next day, Mr. Trump sought to collude with another foreign country in the coming election,\u201d The Post reported Sunday.\n\nNo Russian collusion? How about blackmailing the Kremlin\u2019s threatened next door neighbor, withholding any defense assistance if it didn\u2019t play ball with Mr. Trump and give him the dirt on the son of a possible Democratic foe in the 2020 presidential election?\n\n\u201cThis appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power, to get on the phone with a foreign power who is looking for help from the United States and ask about me, if that\u2019s what happened, that\u2019s what appears to have happened \u201d Mr. Biden told campaign reporters.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s doing this because he knows I will beat him like a drum and is using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try and smear,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n\nMost campaign polls show that Mr. Biden is beating Mr. Trump in head to head matchups in battleground states.\n\nUntil this week no one has released a transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s telephone conversation with the Ukrainian head of state \u2014 though Mr. Biden had challenged him to make it public.\n\nThen in an interview with White House reporters Sunday, before he left for campaign events in Texas and Ohio, Mr. Trump \u201cappeared to suggest he did speak about Biden with Zelensky,\u201d The Post reported.\n\n\u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely [about] all of the corruption taking place, was largely that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nThen, in Houston, Mr. Trump seemed to backtrack, saying, \u201ccertainly I\u2019d have the right to\u201d raise Mr. Biden\u2019s name with Mr. Zelensky.\n\nThen the White House announced it would release a transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s call on Wednesday, much of which was a summary, scattered with ellipsis marks that signaled the omission of one or more words.\n\n\u201cThe other thing, there\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son \u2026 and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d Mr. Trump says in the transcript.\n\n\u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nPresident Zelensky, with nearly $400 million in the balance, said he\u2019d see what he could find out.\n\n\u2022 Donald Lambro is a syndicated columnist and contributor to The Washington Times.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
