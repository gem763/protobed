Goldman Sachs research showed companies that were increasing their earnings by more than 20 per cent were twice as expensive as they were in other markets.\n\n\u201cIf you have a great theme like technology, you only have a small number of quality names in our market so you get this phenomenon of a lot of money squeezing into small doors,\" Mr McGarry said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"That\u2019s why you get these valuation discrepancies.\u201d\n\nInvestors globally are re-assessing valuations of high growth stocks, particularly after the poor performance of recent listings Uber, Lyft and Slack and the catastrophic fallout from the failed initial public offering of WeWork.\n\nShort attack\n\nSharemarket floats have also been pulled in Australia. This week, private equity-backed online classified group PropertyGuru became the third float in a week to be pulled.\n\n\"As an investor, you cannot have pricing if you don\u2019t have confidence in the quality of the business and the earnings,\" said Mr Prunty.\n\n\"For the right IPO, the market would be supportive. It all just comes down to quality of business.\"\n\nMr Prunty said short reports could be right for the wrong reasons and the falls in Corporate Travel, which has also been targeted, and WiseTech, could have \"as much to do with their performance as the content of the reports\".\n\n\"Arguably, at the time, both stocks were trading at quite high premiums to their own trading history, and the [broader] market, and were vulnerable.\"\n\nMr McGarry would not disclose whether Totus Capital was shorting WiseTech but said the stock attracted interest from short-sellers because of its \"high valuation and an unconventional method of growth which is different to other types of software companies\u201d.", "description": "The company has become the largest Australian target of an activist short report after losing just over a fifth of its $10 billion valuation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.8533%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_73%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a354bd497bc3f4d3dd012cda52fde06fa475011b", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
