Andrew Cuomo, sitting down for a chat about bipartisanship with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, said he thought Congress\u2019 impeachment investigation was opened because of pressure from \u201cleftist\u201d Democrats and predicted it would create total gridlock in Washington.\n\nIn what appeared to be a reversal of his comments on Wednesday, when he said \u201cyou\u2019re darn right there should be an inquiry,\u201d Cuomo said Thursday evening that the nation was headed \u201cdown a very long and unproductive road\u201d that will not end with President Donald Trump being removed from office. The three-term Democratic governor implied Speaker Nancy Pelosi was forced into opening the probe.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cSpeaker Pelosi was dealing with pressure from her caucus and, when you talk about pressure from the left, there is a highly leftist component to the Democratic Party that she was feeling pressure for,\u201d Cuomo said during the live, one-on-one conversation at Seton Hall Law School. \u201cShe is a deliberate, responsible person. She\u2019s not a knee-jerk person. And I think she resisted the pressure in her caucus admirably for a long period of time.\u201d\n\nCuomo, who did not comment on the substance of the whistleblower complaint or the partial transcript of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, referred to the House\u2019s investigation as \u201ctheir quote unquote inquiry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the Ukraine issue raises a lot of questions and I think it is, for an investigatory committee, fodder they can spent months, one witness after another, one witness after another, on all sort of different tracks,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWhere does it go ultimately? Nowhere, because even if they vote for impeachment, it goes to the Senate.\u201d\n\nThe remarks came during an hour-long discussion about civility in politics, in which Cuomo and Christie, a Republican, discussed their close friendship and time spent working together on bistate issues.\n\nChristie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before endorsing Trump and leading his transition team, attempted to downplay the significance of the president\u2019s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A partial transcript of the call, released on Wednesday, showed Trump pushing Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nChristie trashed Democrats in the House for how they\u2018ve handled the matter so far, saying they \u201close credibility when they announce an impeachment inquiry before they read the transcript.\u201d\n\nJust before the transcript was released, Christie \u2014 a former U.S. attorney in New Jersey \u2014 said on ABC News that it would be bad if the president had said, \u201clisten, do me a favor, go investigate Joe Biden.\u201d It turned out the president had, in fact, asked Zelensky to do him a favor before making his requests, according to that partial transcript.\n\nChristie called it a \u201ccoincidence\u201d that he had used those words, but then backed off of his suggestion that such phrasing may have justified the sort of investigation now being undertaken.\n\n\u201cThis is the president, who he is and how he talks, and how he does business. And this is no mystery to anybody who\u2019s known him, even just as a public servant over the last three years, let alone me knowing him for 18 years,\u201d Christie said. \u201cSo, yeah, I wouldn\u2019t have said something like that. But that\u2019s the way he talks. That\u2019s the way he does business. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a mystery to the American people.\u201d\n\nBut Christie, who in the past has criticized aides to the president while avoiding criticizing the president, said he was troubled by other allegations in the anonymous whistleblower complaint about how the transcript of that call was handled by officials at the White House. Asked if he thought there was a cover up, Christie said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think right now we have to take a look at exactly what went on there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe conduct of some of the people potentially around him regarding that transcript, I think, is something that has to be answered given the allegations that are in the complaint.\u201d", "description": "The remarks came during an hour-long discussion about civility in politics.", "authors": ["Ryan Hutchins"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c5/c7/439fd90847b2a40a66882d0aaae9/0219trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
