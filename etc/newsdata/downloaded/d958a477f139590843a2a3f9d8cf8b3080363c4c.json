GLOBAL MARKETS-Global share rally pauses on trade risks ahead of Fed\n\n* MSCI ACWI at 21-month high\n\n* Investors expect Fed to cut rates, focus on policy outlook\n\n* Asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\nBy Hideyuki Sano\n\nTOKYO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - A rally in global shares stalled,\n\nwith Asian markets stuck in tight ranges early on Wednesday, as\n\nthe prospect of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve was countered\n\nby worries a Sino-U.S. first-stage trade deal could be delayed.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nwas down 0.16% from Tuesday's three-month high\n\nwhile Japan's Nikkei slid 0.07% after hitting a one-year\n\nhigh the previous day.\n\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 index eked out a record intraday\n\nhigh, led by strong earnings from drug manufacturers such as\n\nMerck MRK.N and Pfizer PFE.N , though a disappointing profit\n\nreport from Google parent Alphabet kept the\n\ntechnology-rich Nasdaq in the red.\n\nMarkets had erased gains after Reuters reported a U.S.\n\nadministration official said an interim trade agreement between\n\nWashington and Beijing might not be completed in time for\n\nsigning in Chile next month as expected. But the official added that it did not mean the accord was\n\nfalling apart, which helped limit the damage to overall market\n\nsentiment.\n\nThe S&P 500 ended down 0.08% and the Nasdaq Composite\n\n0.59%.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe\n\ngained 0.42% on Tuesday to end at a 21-month high, having\n\nrallied 2.6% so far this month.\n\nFor the past few weeks, global equities have drawn support\n\nfrom hopes for a trade compromise between the United States and\n\nChina, as well as from expectations of further U.S. monetary\n\npolicy loosening.\n\nInvestors now expect the Fed to cut interest rates by 0.25\n\npercentage point for the third time this year later in the day.\n\n\"With a cut today completely priced in, markets are looking\n\nto the Fed's stance on its policy outlook,\" said Masahiro\n\nIchikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset\n\nManagement.\n\nWhile Fed funds rate futures 0#FF: fully price in a 25-\n\nbasis-point cut on Wednesday, only about a 30% chance of another\n\ncut in December has been priced in, compared with about 70%\n\nearlier this month.\n\n\"The Fed will probably try to avoid sounding too dovish. Its\n\nmessage will essentially be that while it could act in December\n\nif needed, it won't unless there are big uncertainties on the\n\neconomy,\" said Sumitomo Mitsui's Ichikawa.\n\nFading expectations of aggressive rate cuts by the Fed have\n\nlifted the two-year U.S. bond yield to 1.644% ,\n\ncompared with a two-year low of 1.368% set in early October.\n\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 1.833%\n\n, near a 1-1/2-month high of 1.860% touched earlier\n\nthis week.\n\nThat has helped to lift the dollar against the yen. The\n\ndollar was traded at 108.87 yen , after having hit a\n\nthree-month high of 109.07 yen\n\nThe euro stood at $1.11135 , having bounced off from\n\nTuesday's low of $1.10735.\n\nSterling was little changed after Britain decided to hold an\n\nelection on Dec. 12 following Prime Minister Boris Johnson\n\nwinning approval from parliament for an early ballot aimed at\n\nbreaking the Brexit deadlock. While Johnson seeks to gain a parliamentary majority to\n\nratify his Brexit deal, the election would be highly\n\nunpredictable as Brexit has fatigued and enraged swathes of\n\nvoters, while eroding traditional loyalties to the two major\n\nparties, Conservative and Labour.\n\nThe currency last traded at $1.2866 GBP=D4 ,\n\nOil prices were little changed, with Brent crude\n\nfutures up 0.02% at $61.60 a barrel. U.S. West Texas\n\nIntermediate (WTI) crude lost 0.13% to $55.47 per barrel.\n\n(Editing by Jacqueline Wong)", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Global share rally pauses on trade risks ahead of Fed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/389da45fab1145bdde37c1802bd5980b_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
