Two men they were with are still in hiding.\n\nThe alleged killings sparked a blood feud which left another four dead.\n\nFive other men were acquitted by the court in Besham, in north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.\n\nWhy were they killed?\n\nThe exact details of what took place are not entirely clear.\n\nA video emerged in 2011 which appeared to show the women - Bazeegha, Sereen Jan, Begum Jan and Amina - at a wedding, singing and clapping. A fifth woman - Shaheen, who was under 18 - is also thought to have been present.\n\nIt also showed a man dancing - although they were never in the same shot together. A second man is said to have been filming.\n\nIt was enough, in the remote northern Kohistan district where matters of family honour are settled in blood, to warrant the five women's deaths.\n\nAccording to local custom, male family members of a woman suspected of an out-of-wedlock liaison - even of a seemingly innocuous nature - should first kill the woman, and then go after the man. The family of the man would not oppose this action, correspondents say.\n\nIt meant everyone in the video - which was seen as \"breaching the honour\" of the women's family - was in danger.\n\nHow did it come to light?\n\nThe wider world learned of the video in 2012 when Afzal Kohistani - brother of the two men involved - broke the code of silence to allege the women had been murdered, in order to save his siblings' lives.\n\nHis campaign for justice prompted the Supreme Court to order an investigation into the killings. Investigators trekked for two days to the remote village and were initially presented with three women the locals claimed were those missing. The claims were later dismissed as false.\n\nImage caption Afzal Kohistani had warned his life was in danger\n\nIt took until 2018 for a judge to finally order a court case into their deaths, with the court in Besham finding Bazigha's father Sabeer, Seren Jan's father Saheer and Begum Jan's brother Omar Khan guilty.\n\nDetails of the full court judgement are still awaited.\n\nBut Afzal Kohistani did not live to see the verdict. His decision to speak out led to three of his other brothers being killed in 2013, while his house was firebombed and destroyed.\n\nSix men were convicted of those killings but later acquitted.\n\nThen, in March 2019, Afzal Kohistani was killed, shot dead in the north-western city of Abbottabad.\n\nHis death led activists to question why he hadn't been given adequate protection when he was a known target.\n\nHis brothers remain in hiding.\n\nWhat is an 'honour killing'?\n\nIt is the killing of a member of a family who is perceived to have brought dishonour upon relatives.\n\nPressure group Human Rights Watch says the most common reasons are that the victim:\n\nrefused to enter into an arranged marriage\n\nwas the victim of a sexual assault or rape\n\nhad sexual relations outside marriage, even if only alleged\n\nBut killings can be carried out for more trivial reasons, like dressing in a way deemed inappropriate or displaying behaviour seen as disobedient.", "description": "They are relatives of five Pakistani women thought killed after being filmed singing at a wedding.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/60719000/jpg/_60719900_pakistanwomen.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
