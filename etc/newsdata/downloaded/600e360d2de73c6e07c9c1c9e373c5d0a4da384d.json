But for Mr. Trump, the Saudis have always been a special case, their economic import having often overwhelmed other considerations in his mind\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat struck me about that tweet was not just that it\u2019s obviously wrong to allow Saudi Arabia to dictate our foreign policy, but that the president doesn\u2019t seem to be aware of how submissive it makes him look to say that,\u201d said Representative Tom Malinowski, Democrat of New Jersey and a former assistant secretary of state.\n\n\u201cIt is a big deal to attack oil fields,\u201d Mr. Malinowski added. \u201cIt does affect more than just Saudi Arabia\u2019s interests. But whatever we do, we have to do what\u2019s best for us and we have to recognize that the Saudis have a profound bias.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Trump-Saudi-Tweet.Html"], "top_image": ""}
