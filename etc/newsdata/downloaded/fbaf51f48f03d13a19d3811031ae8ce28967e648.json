REUTERS/Hannah McKay\n\nJohnson announced last week that he will suspend the British parliament from mid-September to mid-October ahead of an Oct. 31 Brexit deadline, enraging his opponents and raising the stakes in the country\u2019s deepest political crisis in decades.\n\nRobert Blackburn, a professor of constitutional law at King\u2019s College university in London, said the cases are likely to be combined and the Supreme Court could overturn the decision to suspend parliament.\n\n\u201cThe legal challenges, if the courts accept the applications for judicial review as legitimate for trial, are certain to be combined and go all the way to the Supreme Court,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Supreme Court could quash and/or declare unlawful\u201d the order.\n\nThe government has said its actions are in line with the convention by which a new prime minister briefly suspends parliament before announcing a new legislative programme.\n\nGINA MILLER\n\nGina Miller, the campaigner who mounted a successful legal challenge to Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s government over its authority to leave the EU without a vote in parliament, is seeking a judicial review of prorogation. The case was heard on Thursday, with a decision due on Friday.\n\nLondon\u2019s High Court was told on Thursday that Johnson abused his powers by ordering the suspension of parliament from next week.\n\nMiller said she had received legal correspondence from government legal officers stating that the issue of prorogation was of no more than \u201cacademic\u201d interest.\n\nShe said this now proved that Johnson has misled the nation and described suspending parliament as a \u201ccynical and cowardly\u201d move.\n\nFormer British Prime Minister John Major has joined the legal case. He has previously accused Johnson of hypocrisy for backing Brexit to secure more power for parliament, only to propose to sideline lawmakers when it suited him.\n\nSCOTTISH COURT\n\nA group of about 70 lawmakers from opposition parties have backed a bid to have Scotland\u2019s highest civil court rule that Johnson cannot suspend, parliament before Britain leaves the European Union on Oct. 31.\n\nThey launched their challenge before Queen Elizabeth agreed to the government\u2019s request for a suspension.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Scottish court ruled that Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament was lawful, saying the matter was not one for judges to decide.\n\nThe lawmakers are appealing that verdict. The appeal began on Thursday and continues on Friday. Scottish National Party lawmaker Joanna Cherry said that the appellants had asked for interim remedies to prevent prorogation pending a final decision in the case.\n\nThe case is being led by Jolyon Maugham, a lawyer who successful won a case filed with the European Union\u2019s top court which ruled that Britain can reverse the Brexit process if it chooses to do so before it leaves the bloc.\n\nNORTHERN IRISH COURT\n\nA legal bid to force Johnson to reverse his plans to suspend Parliament launched in Belfast will be heard on Friday (Sept. 6).\n\nThe case has been taken by Raymond McCord, a rights activist who also launched a 2016 challenge to block Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. He said he fears a no-deal Brexit could wreck the Northern Ireland peace process.\n\nThe action is part of a wider legal action already launched by McCord against any withdrawal from the EU without a deal.\n\nHis legal team have argued in court that a no-deal Brexit would breach the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and that the use of prorogation was unconstitutional and a threat to the Northern Ireland peace process.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend parliament for more than a month before Brexit is being challenged in three court cases that are being heard in court this week.", "authors": ["Andrew Macaskill", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426856559&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850TS", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
