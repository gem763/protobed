They pressure you and force you into mistakes.\n\n\u201cAnd when you are up against really quick players like Raheem Sterling, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford, you can be in trouble.\n\n\u201cGareth Southgate has got an exciting team and they play football.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s intelligent and interesting \u2013 you can see from the way the ball is moved around and the movement of the players that the are ideas there, that the tactics are there.\n\n\u201cSo we need to be careful. To control the ball and, if we have a chance, to take it. It will be pretty much the same Bulgaria side that played at Wembley.\n\n\u201cI think we will probably defend more because if we try to outplay England we will have big problems.\u201d\n\nThree key men England must watch out for\n\nBOZHIDAR KRAEV\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nBulgaria's main goal threat will come from striker Kraev, a 22-year-old who plies his trade in Portugal with Gil Vicente, on loan from FC Midtjylland in Denmark.\n\nHe made his name with Levski Sofia, scoring 22 times in 83 games, and has found the net twice in 11 games for his nation.\n\nEndeared himself to Vicente fans in his first game of the season, with the shock winner against Porto.\n\nMARCELINHO\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe Brazil-born midfielder was one of Bulgaria\u2019s best players at Wembley in September.\n\nNot that he had a particularly good game, he was just one of the few who weren\u2019t awful.\n\nHe joined Bulgarian side Ludogorets in 2011 and qualified for citizenship two years later before a debut for his adopted nation in 2016 against Portugal.\n\nWANDERSON\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAnother naturalised Bulgarian who hails from Brazil, he made headlines, of the unwanted variety, in August when an elaborate goal celebration came back to haunt him.\n\nThe 31-year-old Ludogorets star raced to the sidelines to plant a smacker on the lips of his wife after scoring against Slavia Sofia.
