She was accused of violating a school policy.\n\nPRO-LIFE EVENT IN MINNESOTA DISRUPTED BY BOMB THREAT, SUSPECT ARRESTED\n\nRepresented by the conservative law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty (WILL), Olsen won her case last Friday after U.S. District Court Judge William Griesbach ruled NWTC violated her First Amendment rights, saying the school \"had no more right to prevent [Olsen] from handing out individual Valentines than it did to stop her from wishing each individual to have a 'good morning a blessed day.'\"\n\n\"It's not just my rights, it's everyone's rights on campus that have been violated.\" \u2014 Polly Anna Olsen\n\n\"Several teachers congratulated me,\" she said. \"They are very proud that I stood up for our rights, because it's not just my rights, it's everyone's rights on campus that have been violated.\"\n\nOlsen explained it was because of her faith: \"Well, when Jesus died on the cross and came back to life, he made it so that there's consequences for sin and he paid them, so now there's accountability.\"\n\nBut Jeffrey Rafn, NWTC president, told Fox News in a statement that the ban was because Olsen entered an office without permission, not because of her loving message.\n\n\"The ruling talks about common spaces and I think we'll make it clear that students can be in any of the common spaces,\" Rafn said. \"But the offices are like any other office, you don't normally go into a place and you can't just walk into any office that you want to walk into.\"\n\nThe office that the school president appears to be referring to was one that she said she had entered for seven years. And after Friday's ruling she plans to hand out the cutouts not just on Valentine's Day, but every day.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I'll be handing them out any day now,\" Olsen, who plans to continue to share her story with the Leadership Institute, added. \"That's kind of become my calling card.\"", "description": "A federal judge ruled in favor of a Christian\u00a0student who was told by a Green Bay, Wis. public college that\u00a0she couldn't hand out religious-themed Valentine's Day cards.", "authors": ["Caleb Parke", "Polly Anna Olsen", "Caleb Parke Is An Associate Editor For Foxnews.Com.
