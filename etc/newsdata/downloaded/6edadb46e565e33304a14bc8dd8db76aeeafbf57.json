Those are always good memories. Hopefully we can repeat another one of those next week,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018You have got to expect that it is going to be tougher each week, no matter who the opponent is. We are just looking forward to the challenge.\u2019\n\nNew Zealand were quickly out of the blocks and were 34-0 up before the Irish got their first score. Scrum-half Aaron Smith, who scored the first two tries, said they had more in the tank and Moody agreed.\n\nNew Zealand annihilated Ireland 46-14 in Saturday's quarter-final to set up a huge semi-final\n\nMoody says he has fond memories of New Zealand giving England a 'hiding' in past games\n\n\u2018There were a few areas that we could work on. We lost a bit of pill at lineout so we can tidy that up. Pretty happy with how the scrums went and the backs seemed to be doing the trick when we got them the go-forward. We knew we had to give it to them from the start and not let them build any momentum from that first kick-off. I think we did that.\n\n\u2018We kept the pressure on for the full 80 minutes. I think we can take some confidence out of it but at the same time it was still a tough game. I don\u2019t think the scoreline reflected how tough that game was.\u2019\n\nNew Zealand coach Steve Hansen revealed that Matt Todd, the All Blacks flanker who suffered a shoulder injury on Saturday, is almost definitely out of the England game.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll be available but everyone else is 100 per cent,\u2019 Hansen said. \u2018He dislocated it a wee while ago and got a bang on it. We\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u2019", "description": "Moody was brought up on watching the All Blacks dish out beatings to the English.
