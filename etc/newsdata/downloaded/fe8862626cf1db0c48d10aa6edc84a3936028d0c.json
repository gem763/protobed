They want and expect companies like ours to be leaders and help make a litter-free world possible.\u201d\n\nAvellar is tasked with making this goal a reality in South Africa, and it\u2019s going pretty well already.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s 100% collection and recycling goal will primarily focus on bottles, cans and caps made from glass, PET plastic or aluminium, but also includes packages produced by other companies.\n\nConsumers around the world care about our planet. They want and expect companies like ours to be leaders and help make a litter-free world possible. James Quincey, the president and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company\n\nBy 2025 in South Africa, the company wants to make sure its packaging is 100% recyclable, he says.\n\nBy 2030, the goal a 100% recycling rate from everything the company puts out.\n\nCoca-Cola and its bottlers got together with other manufacturers in South Africa to form the PET Recycling Company (Petco) in 2004.\n\n\n\nThis nonprofit organisation collects a voluntary recycling fee from converters and importers of PET resin, the main material in plastic beverage bottles.\n\nAs a result of the Petco system in South Africa, the recycling rate of PET in the country has rocketed from just 14% in 2005 to more than 63% of total PET volumes last year.\n\nThis puts South Africa ahead of developed markets, such as the EU (60%) and US (28.4%), when it comes to PET collection rates.Last year, the Coca-Cola system in South Africa collected more PET than it put into the market \u2013 113% to be precise \u2013 Avellar says.\n\nAvellar, who hails from Brazil, has been here for six months, but has always recycled his household rubbish.\n\n\u201cWe all have a role to play in recycling. We are global citizens and we should care about our water bodies and communities.
