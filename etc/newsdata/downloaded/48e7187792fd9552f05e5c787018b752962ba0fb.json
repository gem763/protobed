The 31-year-old quarterback was \u201cpretty sore\u201d following the game, Gruden said.\n\nAs of now, Gruden said he assumes Keenum will play next week against the New York Giants.\n\nThe Redskins only held a team walkthrough instead of a full practice, but teams are required to give an estimation of what players would have done under normal circumstances.\n\n\u201cWe thought it was important to keep him off his feet for the day,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how he is (Thursday).\u201d\n\nAgainst the Bears, Keenum had his worst outing of the year, throwing three interceptions and losing two fumbles. The performance led fans to call for rookie Dwayne Haskins to take over, but Gruden resisted making a change. He told reporters Tuesday Keenum gives the Redskins the best chance to win and is confident his team can recover from its 0-3 start.\n\nIf Keenum can\u2019t play Sunday, Gruden said Haskins would be the likely starter. Colt McCoy, who had been a candidate to start, is still battling the leg injury he suffered last season and the Redskins need him to see him practice first. He participated in the Wednesday\u2019s walkthrough for the first time since mid-August, but did not throw a pass.\n\nGruden did not say if he intends for McCoy to supplant Haskins for the backup job, if the veteran is healthy.\n\n\u201cIf (Keenum) can\u2019t go (Thursday), then obviously the other guys will get the reps, which will be good,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cSo that\u2019s a win-win. And if he\u2019s better Friday, and if Case feels like he can go, he can go. We\u2019ll just wait and see.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
