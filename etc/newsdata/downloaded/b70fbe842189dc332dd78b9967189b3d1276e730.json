You go looking for sites of anti-Nazi resistance. Well, of course you do.\n\nMunich was a place of great significance for the guys in the Hugo Boss uniforms and shiny boots. There was, for example, the Munich Agreement of 1938, which didn\u2019t quite give us \u201cpeace for our time\u201d as promised by then British leader Neville Chamberlain, and the B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller beer hall, where Herr A. Hitler had his first tilt at power in 1923 with a putsch. But, of much more interest, Munich is also where two very bold moves were made against the Nazis.\n\nA rainy-day snapshot of Munich's Marienplatz in 1939.\n\nThe B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller was pulled down in the late 1970s, and replaced by the Gasteig cultural centre. Hidden in that complex is something strange and inspiring in equal measure. But after walking around for a quarter of an hour to the sounds of violins being tuned somewhere inside the network of buildings, I couldn\u2019t find it.\n\nI eventually asked a ticket seller. He happily jumped up, left his glass booth and walked me towards a rather grotesque 1980s sculpture in the courtyard. There it was, just beyond: a large bronze plaque in the cobblestones paying tribute to a man who tried to assassinate a head of state \u2013 and killed eight others in the botched process.\n\nHis name was Georg Elser. He was a 36-year-old carpenter with a penchant for playing the zither. And in 1939 he single-handedly hatched a plan to blow up the B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller when Hitler, now successfully installed as F\u00fchrer, returned to commemorate the anniversary of the Beer Hall Putsch.\n\nZither player and would-be assassin Georg Elser: but for the weather, he could have rewritten 20th-century history. Getty\n\nOver 30-plus nights, Elser snuck in after closing time and hollowed out a column next to the stage. He inserted a time-bomb, surrounded by cork to muffle the ticking. Elser later explained that he \u201cwanted to stop the war\u201d.\n\nThere was nothing to do but stare and reflect on how many things would have changed for the better if not for those 13 minutes.\n\nThe bomb was set for 9.20pm, November 8, but due to bad weather Hitler changed his arrangements and missed being blown up by 13 minutes. Elser was captured at the Swiss border and eventually executed in 1945, a month before the end of World War II; Hitler saw his own escape as divine providence (as narcissists do).", "description": "Learning about the White Rose resistance movement and a plan to assassinate the Nazi leader is one way to fill in spare hours in the Bavarian capital.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5295%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_111/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3c7e10adfa7c8697bf27f8aac441f84c408c46de", "published_at": "2019-09-03"}
