They are not to ask you to stop expressing your anger. That is your decision to make,\u201d Hariri, himself a prime minister\u2019s son, said in a televised press conference.\n\nEuphoric crowds had partied deep into the night Sunday, leaving all political and sectarian paraphernalia at home to gather under the national cedar flag, dance to impromptu concerts and chant often hilarious anti-establishment slogans.\n\nThey were back in front the houses of government and on the main Martyrs\u2019 Square on Monday to listen to Hariri\u2019s announcement, which was broadcast on loudspeakers.\n\nThe crowd erupted into shouts of \u201crevolution, revolution\u201d when Hariri finished his address.\n\n\u201cWe want the fall of the regime,\u201d they went on.\n\n\u201cThis is all just smoke and mirrors\u2026 How do we know these reforms will be implemented,\u201d said Chantal, a 40-year-old who joined the protest with her little daughter and a Lebanese flag painted on her cheek.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Day of destiny\u2019 \u2013\n\nHariri detailed some of the measures taken by his fractious cabinet, including a programme of privatisations, a decision to scrap new tax hikes and salary cuts for ministers and lawmakers.\n\nLebanon\u2019s embattled political leaders have warned that the government\u2019s resignation at this time would only deepen the crisis gripping the small Mediterranean country.\n\nHariri also said he supported the idea of early elections, a key demand among the hundreds of thousands of protesters who have taken to Lebanon\u2019s streets since Thursday.\n\nPresident Michel Aoun, who had been conspicuously silent since the start of the demonstrations, suggested at the beginning of the cabinet meeting that banking secrecy should be lifted for high-ranking officials.\n\nLebanon has strict rules over bank account privacy that critics say makes the country susceptible to money laundering.\n\nAoun\u2019s son-in-law and ally, Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, has been a particular figure of anger among protesters.\n\nTo many demonstrators, the reforms Hariri announced smacked of a desperate attempt by a corrupt elite to cling to their jobs, and there was little sign Monday that the mobilisation was weakening.\n\n\u201cIt is a day of destiny for us. All our hard work and efforts in previous days and years were to get us to this moment,\u201d Roni al-Asaad, a 32-year-old activist in central Beirut, said.\n\n\u201cIf they could have implemented these reforms before, why haven\u2019t they? And why should we believe them today?\u201d\n\nWhat was initially dubbed the \u201cWhatsApp revolution\u201d morphed into a mass non-partisan push for a total overhaul of a sectarian power system still run mostly by civil war-era warlords, three decades after the end of the country\u2019s conflict.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Volcano\u2019 \u2013\n\nGiven the size of the gatherings, the five-day-old mobilisation has been remarkably incident free, with armies of volunteers forming to clean up the streets, provide water to protesters and organise first aid tents.\n\nLebanon\u2019s debt-burdened economy has been sliding towards collapse in recent months, adding to the economic woes of a population exasperated by rampant corruption, the lack of job opportunities and poor services.\n\nAmong the protesters\u2019 main grievances is the poor supply of electricity from the state.\n\nUsually prone to blame anti-government mobilisation on another party or a foreign conspiracy, Lebanon\u2019s top political figures have appeared to acknowledge that none of them were spared by public anger.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in the street is a volcano that can\u2019t be contained with timely solutions,\u201d Imad Salamey, a political science professor at the Lebanese American University, said.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult for the demonstrators to regain trust in the state in 72 hours and with solutions only presented on paper,\u201d he said.\n\nSchools, banks, universities and many private businesses closed their doors Monday, both for security reasons and in an apparent bid to encourage people to join the demonstrations.", "description": "Beirut (AFP) \u2013 Lebanon\u2019s teetering government approved an economic rescue plan Monday but the last-ditch move was met with deep distrust from", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/586e18_hundreds-thousands-people-joined-protests-demanding-sweeping-overhaul-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
