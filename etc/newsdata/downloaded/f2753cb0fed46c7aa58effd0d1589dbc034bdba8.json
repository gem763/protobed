Another saw snacking on energy-dense foods fall by up to 20 per cent, in around four weeks, with weight loss of around one and half pounds, while weight of those in the control group rose.\n\nThe programmes were delivered online, on computers or smartphone applications.\n\nResearcher Prof Chris Chambers, from Cardiff University, said a few idle moments could be enough to help dieters improve their daily eating habits.\n\nHe said: \u201cSmartphones are the most promising way to deliver boosting interventions for encouraging healthy eating because most adults have a smartphone and they can be used during times when we all have a few minutes to spare, such as on the commute to work.\u201d", "description": "Brain training on smartphones could help dieters to resist temptation, research suggests.", "authors": ["Laura Donnelly", "Health Editor", "Philip Johnston", "Matthew Goodwin", "Sherelle Jacobs", "Michael Deacon", "Olivia Utley"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/02/23/sponge-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqjJjRpbizeqTeQHsp8ASBd4lOLWOzRylj_AnLJvEY95k.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
