Research from Lloyds shows that 36 per cent of people say they have felt worried, 29 per cent have felt embarrassed and 18 per cent ashamed talking about their personal finances.\n\nFor the under-45s, that\u2019s even higher.\n\n\u2018A good opportunity\u2019\n\nStarting conversations about finances can feel difficult but Claire Porter, associate solicitor in the family law team at SAS Daniels, says that marrying or moving in together can provide the perfect prompt for a frank discussion.\n\n\u201cIf you choose to buy a house with your partner, a mortgage lender will request bank statements to assess affordability, she explains. \u201cMortgage lenders pay attention to any existing debts, so a good way to initiate discussion around this area is to point that out. It will give you a good opportunity to go through bank statements and other documents together before submitting to lenders.\u201d\n\nAs someone experienced in mediating between family members who disagree, she has some advice on ensuring those difficult conversations go well.\n\n\u201cCouples should be clear about what their cohabitation will look like on a day-to-day basis, for instance who\u2019s responsible for paying the mortgage, utility bills or household repairs. Consider if a joint account for bills is a good idea, or whether you\u2019d both prefer to retain sole accounts. A frank and honest discussion at the start can prevent issues arising in the future.\u201d\n\nSo what if the conversation does veer off course as one partner admits to more debt, perhaps, than the other had expected? Peter Saddington, a Relate counsellor working with Lloyds, says: \u201cThere can be a lot of intense feelings but the important thing is to have a calm conversation about the issues. Tell them how you feel rather than focusing on what they are doing wrong to avoid coming across as critical and accusatory.\u201d\n\nIt can even be a positive step, laying the groundwork for a more honest and open relationship. Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director of Fidelity International, says: \u201cStart with conversations about debt and earnings. Once you\u2019ve tackled these, then you\u2019re on a really sound footing and ideally placed to talk about your future hopes and dreams.\n\n\u201cNow\u2019s the time to discuss your future financial hope and set in place realistic plans to achieve them. Knowing not only exactly where your finances are, but also where those of your partner are, means you\u2019re in a very strong position for a bright financial future together.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t obsess but always keep open communication lines. Money is part and parcel of life and having a healthy relationship with it will be the cornerstone of a healthy relationship with your other half.\u201d\n\nOf course, you might not want to blend your finances. Moving in together will tie your finances, assuming you share bills. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to combine everything.\n\nJoe Roxborough, an independent financial adviser at the firm Ascot Lloyd, says: \u201cAn important thing to decide is how much or little you wish to mix your finances with your partner. This may be determined by your existing commitments to children, ex-spouses or otherwise, and being upfront with your financial obligations and objectives will be best to ensure you aren\u2019t misleading (or being misled).\u201d\n\n\u2018A test of a relationship in general\u2019\n\nSome couples bare everything in advance of marriage or co-habitation with a prenup or \u201cliving together agreement\u201d but that\u2019s often only for wealthier couples who have assets to protect.\n\nSarah Passemard, a family law partner at Paris Smith, says that prenups might be more common if couples saw it more like making a power of attorney: \u201cIt's a responsible step to take, to avoid potential problems in the future. Hopefully it won't be needed but if it is, they are demonstrating that they are thinking about the future for both, not just themselves.\n\n\u201cIt's almost a test of a relationship in general. Granted, some people find it difficult to talk about money, the same way many people can't talk about death. I'm not suggesting that couples should always have everything jointly. I am suggesting that in a long-term relationship you should have a fair idea of each other's assets, pensions and income.\n\n\u201cHow can you make life decisions together unless you know? Can you afford to move? Take that new job? Go on holiday? Privately educate your children? Retire? Even go out for dinner? Even though it might be an uncomfortable conversation, discussing money is fundamental to having a life together.\u201d\n\nAwkward, taboo, uncomfortable maybe. But having this conversation now might save a lot more heartache long-term.", "description": "It\u2019s wedding season.
