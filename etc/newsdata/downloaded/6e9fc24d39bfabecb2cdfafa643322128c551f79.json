Cinematic superiority aside, Coppola\u2019s movies feature some of the most iconic fashion moments of the last two decades. Think Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) twirling to New Order in a luxe Victorian ballgown or The Bling Ring posse accessorizing with oversized, rhinestone sunnies and giant iced coffees on their way to rob Lindsay Lohan\u2019s house. Below are a few more of our favorite looks from Coppola\u2019s movies.\n\n\"The Virgin Suicides\" (film still).\n\nThe Lisbon sisters at Homecoming in The Virgin Suicides\n\nCoppola made her directing debut with The Virgin Suicides, a curious tale of five sheltered Midwestern sisters \u2014 Cecilia, Lux, Bonnie, Mary, and Therese Lisbon \u2014 who all feel imprisoned by their gender and the modest 70s fashions their Catholic mother favors for them. Most notably, are the \u201cfour identical sacks\u201d that the Lisbon sisters wear to Homecoming, with their girlish flutter sleeves and delicate babydoll necklines. Nowadays nostalgic prairie looks are making a comeback of sorts, but naturally, they weren\u2019t having it. Lux (Kirsten Dunst) manages to give hers a subtle, playful twist, writing her date Trip\u2019s name on the outside of her underwear and dotting the letter \u201ci\u201d with a heart like a true Homecoming Queen.\n\nCharlotte singing karaoke in Lost in Translation\n\nThis iconic scene is instantly recognizable for two reasons: Charlotte\u2019s pink bobbed wing and her convincingly lusty performance of \u201cBrass in Pocket\u201d by The Pretenders. \u201c'Cause I\u2019m gonna make you see/ There's nobody else here/ No one like me,\u201d she sings, her coiffed hair offset with a classic black shift dress. Though Charlotte, who was played by an 18-year-old Scarlett Johansson, certainly grabs the audience\u2019s attention. \u201cSofia's pretty classic and kind of not showy, but always beautiful and we wanted Scarlett to feel like that, too, like she was effortless,\u201d costumer designer Nancy Steiner said.\n\n\"The Bling Ring\" (film still).\n\nNicki\u2019s courtroom look in The Bling Ring\n\nThe Bling Ring is inspired by a series of IRL burglaries in the Hollywood Hills that were carried out by a group of fame-obsessed teens. However, the film is also an ode to the terribly fantastic fashion of the aughts, popularized by the robbery victims themselves like Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton. The era is distilled onscreen in the form of Ugg boots, Juicy Couture tracksuits, and Tiffany charm necklaces. Nicki, who\u2019s played by Emma Watson, wears a courtroom look that predates the discussion of inimitable scammer style, but it\u2019s almost more memorable than her constant lip gloss application throughout the film. Outside the courthouse, with half her face obscured by her oversized sunglasses, she says, \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in karma and I think this situation is a huge learning lesson for me to grow and expand as a spiritual human being. I want to lead a country one day for all I know.\u201d\n\nKirsten Dunst\u2019s boudoir moment in Marie Antoinette\n\nThere\u2019s an endless supply of lavish style inspiration in Coppola\u2019s Marie Antoinette, where she reimagines the story of France\u2019s ill-fated Queen in the form of a pastel-colored, saccharine fantasy. Corsets aside, there\u2019s one particular scene where the lack of period fashion itself defines the iconic fashion moment. After a night of revelry at the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles, Marie Antoinette takes to her bedroom to await her lover Axel von Fersen (Jamie Dornan), wearing only a feather atop her head and white over-the-knee-socks tied up with pale blue satin ribbons. Oh, and lest we forget the artfully placed fan.\n\nCleo goes ice skating in Somewhere\n\nBefore the allure of Margot Robbie\u2019s sequins and glittering spandex in I, Tonya, and the ice skating obsession that ensued (and even trickled onto Balenciaga\u2019s runway) there was a young Elle Fanning playing Cleo in Somewhere. Her look of choice? A light blue skirted leotard in a glittering velvet, which pairs well with her routine performed to Gwen Stefani\u2019s \u201cCool.\u201d Cleo completes her jumps, turns, and swirls, in an ethereal manner, as if she\u2019s floating amongst the clouds.\n\nTrip Fontaine as the ultimate 70s stud in The Virgin Suicides\n\nWhile we\u2019ve focused mostly on the leading ladies of Coppola\u2019s films, it\u2019s impossible to compile this list without revisiting Josh Hartnett\u2019s portrayal of Trip Fontaine in The Virgin Suicides. He\u2019s the quintessential 70s heartthrob that gives Michael Kelso a run for his money. Naturally, all the girls at school love his luscious long locks, tinted aviator sunglasses, and dopey brown eyes. And let\u2019s not forget that puka shell necklace. For Homecoming, he dressed it up with a custom look. \u201cI designed that burgundy velvet suit,\u201d Steiner explains. \u201cWe made that so that he could stand out from the other boys because he was just so hot.\u201d\n\n\"The Beguiled\" (film still).\n\nAlicia all dressed up in The Beguiled\n\nCoppola\u2019s latest film, The Beguiled, is another period piece though this time the auteur takes us on a journey back to the American Civil War. When a wounded Union soldier (Colin Farrell) turns up on the doorstep of an all girls school in Virginia, it sends Miss Martha (Nicole Kidman) and her pupils into Southern gothic frenzy. While the cast of Coppola\u2019s favorites rock some pretty modest 19th century threads, mixing prints like something out of Batsheva\u2019s catalog, we\u2019re smitten with the soft pink, lace trimmed dress that Alicia wears to their dinner one night. \u201cWith Elle [Fanning as Alicia], I wanted her to feel flirty, so she has a lot of ruffles and pastels. She was the flirtiest character,\u201d costume designer Stacey Battat said.", "description": "The director\u2019s vision is more felt in fashion than ever, from the modest prairie dresses in \u2018The Virgin Suicides\u2019 to the highly stylized looks in \u2018Marie Antoinette.\u2019", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9b921339335f000a93fa74/lede/1570546102639-image-11-11.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
