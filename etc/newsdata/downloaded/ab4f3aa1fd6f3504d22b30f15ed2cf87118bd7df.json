Plus, 48 states are investigating Google, and there is scrutiny from both Democrats and Republicans. \"It's unique to have such scrutiny from both sides,\" said Bloom.\n\nHis remarks were made during a panel discussion organized by the Save Journalism Project -- founded by laid-off reporters. The activist organization blames Google and Facebook for decimating ad revenues for independent newspapers and magazines, resulting in huge numbers of layoffs and endangering a free press.\n\n\"Monopolies are not illegal under our antitrust laws, but exclusionary conduct is illegal,\" he said. US investigators are likely to follow European anti-trust investigations, which resulted in several massive fines totaling more than $9 billion.\n\nBloom pointed to the success of the EU's investigations that found Google guilty of promoting its own businesses over others, and it received a $5 billion fine.\n\nBloom has been working on Goggle anti-trust issues since 2011 -- these were the first government hearings on the search giant's business practices.\n\nMicrosoft was found guilty of exclusionary conduct, by insisting that its operating system had to be loaded onto PCs and integrating competing software. Google has been insisting that companies licensing its Android operating system have to also load Google apps.\n\nBloom said there are serious issues with Google banning third-party cookies under the guise of user privacy while it collects all the user data it wants. This is a clear example of exclusionary conduct.\n\nLaura Bassett, the co-founder of the Save Journalism Project, said, \"One or two companies should not have the power to cripple the free press in the US.\"", "description": "Google's case is similar to 19 years ago -- when Microsoft was found guilty of exclusionary conduct", "authors": ["Tom Foremski"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/11/c4245051-5c4e-47e0-b37b-adef70e3c36a/thumbnail/770x578/93243d93acc671666245bdcb72c0f63a/50-us-states-territories-launch-google-a-5d72569b8fd977000190e0fb-1-sep-11-2019-20-38-10-poster.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
