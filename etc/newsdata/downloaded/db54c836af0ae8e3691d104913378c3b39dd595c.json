A man also reported in August that he believes he saw a thylacine on his land about seven years ago.\n\nTorsten Blackwood/AFP via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe Tasmanian tiger is the largest carnivorous marsupial of recent times and was found on the Australian mainland and island of New Guinea, according to Britannica. It was presumed to be extinct after the last captive animal died in 1936 at the Hobart Zoo in Tasmania.\n\nThe animal, which has the face of a fox and yellowish, brown fur and stripes along its back, hunted at night for wallabies and birds, according to Britannica. While it has a skull similar to that of a dog, the females have a shallow pouch that can carry two to four young at a time.", "description": "Sightings of the Tasmanian tiger, a large carnivorous marsupial thought to be extinct since 1936, have been reported as recently as three months ago.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/tasmanian-tiger-gty-aa-191017_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
