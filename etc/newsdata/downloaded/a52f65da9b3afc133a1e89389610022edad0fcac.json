(AP) - The Minnesota Vikings had moved on, comfortable going in a new direction at punt returner and distancing themselves from one of the biggest first-round draft misses in team history.\n\nAll it took was one injury for both Marcus Sherels and Laquon Treadwell to come back.\n\nWhen Chad Beebe was put on injured reserve on Tuesday with an ankle injury suffered in the fourth quarter of their game against Oakland on Sunday, the Vikings suddenly had a need for both a punt returner and a wide receiver. So Sherels and Treadwell got the calls.\n\n\u201cWell, Marcus is a great kid, No. 1,\u201d coach Mike Zimmer said on Wednesday. \u201cThey both are. And we needed a punt returner, so that was pretty simple. Tread\u2019s been working hard. I talked to him last week. I think he\u2019s rededicated himself to the things that he needs to try to get done. Knows the system, and we anticipate him doing well.\u201d\n\nTreadwell was the No. 23 overall pick in the 2016 draft out of Mississippi. He had 56 catches for 517 yards and one touchdown in three seasons with the Vikings, before being cut on Aug. 31 when they set their roster for the opening week.\n\nSherels, who went undrafted out of Minnesota in 2010 and turned a rookie camp tryout into a nine-season run with the Vikings, holds the franchise record for punt return touchdowns (five) and average (10.6 yards). He was valued for his sure-handedness on punts and missed just nine total games over the previous eight seasons, while also filling in occasionally at cornerback.\n\n\u201cThis is home for me,\u201d said Sherels, a native of Rochester, Minnesota. \u201cIt\u2019s always been home. It always will be home. It\u2019s good being back. The guys have embraced me with open arms, and I\u2019m ready to help contribute in any way I can.\u201d\n\nSherels signed with New Orleans in the offseason but was injured in training camp and missed the entire preseason. The Saints opted to go with undrafted rookie Deonte Harris at punt returner instead. Sherels said he\u2019s healthy now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never really gone through this before so it was kind of new,\u201d Sherels said. \u201cYou always have to be ready and be in shape. You never know when that call is going to come.\u201d\n\nTreadwell was unsure, too.\n\nHe had visits to Buffalo and Detroit in the week following his release but went unsigned. He reached out to players and coaches for advice, including former Denver and Chicago wide receiver Brandon Marshall. He also called Zimmer.\n\n\u201cI talked to him about, really, what he needs to do to prove that this is a thing that he really loves to do, how important this is to him,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cI think it\u2019s always been important to him, but I think maybe he might have went about it the wrong way. So I just tried to give him some insight of what he has to do moving forward. Hopeful to see that.\u201d\n\nTreadwell said being released \u201cwas hard for me to cope with for a little bit.\u201d His grandmother had just died, and he returned home to Illinois for the funeral. There was no indication from Zimmer when they spoke about how to approach a potential new team that he\u2019d be returning to Minnesota.\n\n\u201cHe was just like, \u2018If you\u2019re going to go on a team, it\u2019s a fresh start. Walk in with confidence, and that\u2019s the kind of guy I would want on my team,\u2019\u201d Treadwell said. \u201cSo I\u2019m back here, and so that\u2019s the mindset: Just walk in and have confidence. It\u2019s a fresh start for me. I\u2019m going to have fun and I\u2019m going to help this team win and do everything I got to do.\u201d\n\nAfter letting Treadwell go, Minnesota ended up signing Josh Doctson, who was drafted one spot ahead of Treadwell in 2016. Doctson didn\u2019t play a game with the Vikings, before a hamstring injury sent him to injured reserve.\n\nLosing Beebe left the Vikings, who have thrown a league-low 21 passes per game, with only three healthy receivers in starters Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs, and seventh-round rookie Olabisi Johnson on the 53-man roster. Zimmer said he expects Beebe to return later this season from injured reserve.\n\nIn the meantime, Treadwell has another chance with the team that drafted him.\n\n\u201cI jumped for joy a little bit. I ain\u2019t going to lie,\u201d Treadwell said. \u201cI was kind of super geeked up.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Minnesota Vikings had moved on, comfortable going in a new direction at punt returner and distancing themselves from one of the biggest first-round draft misses in team history.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brian Hall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/vikings_moves_football_31237_c0-95-1646-1054_s1770x1032.jpg?d31338fe0ca53720075b5d5f8652627e02fda234", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
