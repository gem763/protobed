The meeting at the Hyatt, shortly before midnight, was effectively a job interview for the vacant managerial post at Aston Villa. On Thursday, he celebrates one year in charge, with the club promoted back to the Premier League and winning over a new generation of fans with a thrilling brand of football.\n\nIt is an extraordinary rise, and reward for an arduous career path which started nearly 15 years ago in Leyton Orient\u2019s youth academy. Smith has always craved this job, ever since standing in the Holte End as a fan with his brother Dave in the early 1980s.\n\n\u201cEveryone can see the passion and ideas Dean has for the club, but it\u2019s almost like he is just starting,\u201d says Richard O\u2019Kelly, one of Smith\u2019s assistants and a crucial figure behind the scenes over the last seven years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a case of him reaching his dream job and thinking that\u2019s enough. He wants to come here and really achieve something. He is very focused on what he\u2019s doing, building things, establishing a structure, and he does it really well.\u201d", "description": "It was just over a year ago that Dean Smith climbed into his car on a chilly autumn evening, left his home in Great Barr and set off for the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Birmingham.", "authors": ["John Percy", "Luke Edwards", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000212106638-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfUfiMSqmkoakOSsypyffx8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
