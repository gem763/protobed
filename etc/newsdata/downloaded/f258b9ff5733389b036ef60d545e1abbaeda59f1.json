Here\u2019s how to fight back", "language": "en", "text": "Today, the state of New York will face off with ExxonMobil for oral arguments in the trial alleging that the company misled investors by providing false assurances that the company was adequately costing climate-related risks. But win or lose, that doesn\u2019t mean an end to deliberate misinformation campaigns. Here\u2019s what we should all know about how to resist those efforts by Exxon and other big corporate actors.\n\nScientists have known for decades that the burning of fossil fuels is causing climate change. There is so much evidence that at least 97% of climate scientists agree that humans are causing global warming. It\u2019s as settled as the link between smoking and cancer.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry has known about the role of its products in global warming for 60 years. Exxon\u2019s own scientists warned their managers 40 years ago of \u201cpotentially catastrophic events\u201d. Yet rather than alerting the public or taking action, these companies have spent the past few decades pouring millions of dollars into disinformation campaigns designed to delay action. All the while, the science is clear that climate-catalyzed damages have worsened, storms have intensified, and droughts and heatwaves have become more frequent and severe, while forests have been damaged and wildfires have burned through the country.\n\nDivestment works \u2013 and one huge bank can lead the way | Bill McKibben Read more\n\nBy polluting the information landscape, these companies misrepresented the safety of their product and denied the public their right to be accurately informed.\n\nBig oil is not the only industry to do so. Big tobacco is a famous case, but asbestos and lead industries have done it too. These days, campaigns by soda companies to contest sugar science and by the NFL to distort the science on concussions use similar tactics. The campaigns all run a similar playbook: they cite fake experts, place impossible demands on the science, cherry-pick data, impugn the integrity of individual scientists and the scientific process, and appeal to conspiracy theories. They leave the public with the perpetual impression that there are lots of unresolved questions, and that scientists are not to be trusted.\n\nResearch has confirmed that disinformation works, which is, of course, why special interests fund it. So it is crucial to expose disinformation for what it is, so that the public doesn\u2019t fall prey to the next industrial-scale propaganda effort.\n\nIn our report America Misled: How the Fossil Fuel Industry Deliberately Misled Americans About Climate Change, we document how the fossil fuel industry has misled the American public (and the world). We expose the most common myths about climate change generated by big oil and the misleading techniques used by Exxon.\n\nOur planet is accumulating heat at a rate of over four atomic bombs per second\n\nFor example, cold weather is often used to argue that global warming isn\u2019t happening. This favorite talking point of President Trump is an extreme form of cherry picking: ignoring what\u2019s happening to our planet by focusing on local weather conditions. Just because the planet is heating up rapidly doesn\u2019t mean cold weather in North Dakota will cease to exist overnight. But if we look at the overall picture, it\u2019s hot and getting hotter. Our planet is accumulating heat at a rate of over four atomic bombs per second, and the four hottest years on record are the last four years.\n\nExxon also misled us through arguments that appear convincing but contain logical fallacies. One is the argument that climate has changed naturally in the past, so today\u2019s climate change must be natural, also. But just because something happened naturally in the past doesn\u2019t mean it has to be natural now; the conclusion doesn\u2019t follow from the premise. It\u2019s like arguing that people have died naturally from cancer in the past, therefore smoking can\u2019t cause cancer today.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the classic tactic of citing fake experts to cast doubt on the expert consensus on human-caused global warming. The most prominent example is an internet petition of 31,000 dissenting \u201cexperts\u201d who think humans aren\u2019t disrupting the climate. However, over 99% of the signatories have no expertise in climate research \u2013 it\u2019s populated with graduates of programs in computer science, veterinary science, and mechanical engineering, as well as dead people and pop stars, but very few with climate expertise. In actual fact, 97% or more of domain experts agree on the fundamental fact that greenhouse gas emissions are warming the planet.\n\nExposing and explaining the techniques of denial are crucial steps in neutralizing disinformation, not just from the fossil fuel industry but from any source. Once people know the ways they can be deceived, disinformation no longer has power over them. As Edward Everett once said: \u201cEducation is a better safeguard of liberty than a standing army.\u201d But it\u2019s not enough to offer information \u2013 we also have to expose disinformation, so that people understand what we have been up against.", "description": "It\u2019s crucial to expose the fossil fuel industry\u2019s disinformation tactics so the public doesn\u2019t fall prey to the next effort", "authors": ["John Cook", "Geoffrey Supran", "Naomi Oreskes", "Stephan Lewandowsky", "Ed Maibach"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0245bdc5d342de3f1ec32bf47f9a7e4054caa22/0_179_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=db2130b04cf0397ea1ecdec7a6ed1e1e", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
