It will curtail production and restrict traffic.\n\nXuzhou, home to more than a dozen steel firms, started restricting steel output on Wednesday, and will close down all production from Thursday evening. Coking coal producers will also be subject to controls.\n\nRestrictions will be placed on freight vehicle deliveries in major industries and on straw burning in rural districts. The city will also work to source its electricity from cleaner and efficient sources over the next few days.\n\nIn smog-prone Anyang, another major steel producing city in central China\u2019s Henan province, authorities have implemented \u201cred alert\u201d pollution control measures that started on Wednesday, imposing tougher restrictions on industry and transportation.\n\nAccording to a government notice circulated by traders and the local media, Anyang ordered small, independent sintering plants to close on Wednesday, and will shut down all steel production from Thursday evening.\n\nAnyang was one of China\u2019s most polluted cities last winter, with concentrations of PM2.5 up 27% over the period. It is located near the Taihang mountain range, which the environment ministry said is currently trapping emissions and channelling them towards Beijing.", "description": "The heavy industrial city of Xuzhou in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu will shut local factories on Thursday as part of efforts to reduce smog ahead of the country's National Day celebrations next week, the local government said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433941718&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O2F2", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
