We will apply the rules.'\n\nTwo million people have so far applied to the scheme, according to Home Office figures.\n\nBrandon Lewis, pictured in Manchester at Conservative Party conference on October 2, told a German newspaper that the UK 'will apply the rules' to any EU citizens living in the UK who do not have settled status\n\nBut that leaves hundreds of thousands more EU citizens who live in the UK who still need to apply for settled status before the deadline.\n\nAs recently as yesterday, the Home Office said EU citizens had until 'at least' December 2020 to apply, but Mr Lewis's words appear to be a hardening of the deadline.\n\nMaike Bohn, a spokeswoman for campaign group the3million, said the organisation - which represents EU citizens who live in the UK - had pressed the government 'for years' to acknowledge what would happen to those people who had not aquired settled status by the start of 2021.\n\n'Today, after much wait, it is confirmed that hundreds and thousands of people will be punished with the threat of removal from their home. This is no way to treat people, let alone what was promised,' she said.\n\n'Those people who miss the tight deadline will face the full force of the hostile environment.\n\n'That is the grim reality of the UK Government's position, no matter how many times they repeat the phrase \"EU citizens and their families are our friends, neighbours and colleagues and we want them to stay\".'\n\nA statement from a Home Office spokesman repeated a similar phrase and added: 'We have received two million applications and are looking for reasons to grant status, not refuse, and EU citizens have until at least December 2020 to apply.\n\n'We've always been clear that where they have reasonable grounds for missing the deadline, they'll be given a further opportunity to apply.'\n\nBut Lib Deb shadow home secretary Christine Jardine warned 'thousands' of people could be left undocumented by the 'arbitrary' deadline, which she said could create another Windrush-style scandal.\n\nShe said: 'I am absolutely appalled. I have just been at a school where a Hungarian-born pupil told me she was scared about Brexit, and now I learn that the Conservative Government is threatening to deport people like her.\n\n'Brandon Lewis has finally confirmed what we've known all along: Boris Johnson has no intention of keeping his promise to automatically guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in the UK. That is totally unacceptable.'", "description": "Brandon Lewis said people may be forced to leave the UK if they do not sign up to the EU settlement scheme by the end of 2020 - even if they meet all requirements for a residence permit.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/17/19549922-0-image-a-5_1570725946126.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
