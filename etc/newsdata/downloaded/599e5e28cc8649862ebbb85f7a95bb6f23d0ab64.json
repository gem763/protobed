The added perk doesn\u2019t raise the student plan\u2019s price: it\u2019s still $4.99 per month for full access to the music streaming service. The only real caveat is that, as always, you need to verify that you\u2019re enrolled at a college of some sort to qualify for the discounted rate.\n\nApple is giving away Apple TV Plus to hook viewers and generate buzz for shows\n\nApple doesn\u2019t usually like giving things away for free, or even at discounts, so the addition of Apple TV Plus to the student plan is somewhat surprising. It\u2019s a smart addition, though. Apple needs to reach a mass of viewers if it wants to make the service into a truly profitable, sustainable business. One way to do that is to get people hooked on series that they\u2019ll have to pay for later. Apple is already doing that in one other major way: purchases of most new Apple devices now come with a one-year subscription. That means hundreds of millions of people Apple could potentially hook and get to keep subscribing.\n\nGiven that Apple is only charging $4.99 per month for the entirety of Apple TV Plus, it might have been a hard sell for students as it is given the small size of the service\u2019s library. Bundling it won\u2019t necessarily lose much for Apple, and it gives the company a lot to gain in the way of potential subscribers and buzz for its shows.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson told us the bundle would be available for \u201ca limited time,\u201d though it\u2019s not clear whether that means Apple TV Plus will be cut out later this year or sometime down the road when the service\u2019s price inevitably goes up once it has more content and \u2014 with some luck \u2014 some prestige behind it.", "description": "Apple Music student plan subscriptions now include Apple TV Plus.
