REUTERS/Rodi Said\n\nHere are some reactions to the operation:\n\nUNITED NATIONS\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said any military operation must fully respect the U.N. Charter and international humanitarian law. Spokesman Farhan Haq said: \u201cCivilians and civilian infrastructure should be protected. The secretary-general believes that there\u2019s no military solution to the Syrian conflict.\u201d\n\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker urged Turkey to show restraint and stop its military operation. \u201cIf the plan involves the creation of a so-called safe zone, don\u2019t expect the EU to pay for any of it,\u201d he said.\n\nNATO\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said he hoped Turkey\u2019s operations in Syria would be measured and proportionate.\n\nEGYPT\n\nEgypt\u2019s foreign ministry condemned the offensive as \u201ca blatant and unacceptable attack on the sovereignty of a brotherly Arab state\u201d. It called for an emergency meeting of the League of Arab States.\n\nGERMANY\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Turkey\u2019s operation would lead to further destabilisation of the region and could strengthen Islamic State. He urged Turkey to end the operation.\n\nFRANCE\n\nFrance\u2019s European affairs minister Amelie de Montchalin said France and Britain would call a U.N. Security Council meeting over the Turkish offensive. France, Germany and Britain are finalising a joint statement condemning the advance.\n\nITALY\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the operation risked destabilising the region and harming civilians.\n\nDENMARK\n\nDanish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod tweeted: \u201cDeeply concerned about Turkish military operation in Syria. In my view, this is a regrettable and wrong decision, which can have serious consequences for civilians and the fight against ISIL (Islamic State). Turkey must show restraint. Denmark is in close contact with allies on the matter.\u201d\n\nTHE NETHERLANDS\n\nDutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok summoned the Turkish ambassador and said: \u201cThe Netherlands condemns the Turkish offensive in northeast Syria. \u201cWe call on Turkey not to continue on the path they are going down.\u201d", "description": "Turkey launched a military operation against Kurdish fighters in northeast Syria on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1439020535&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9823R", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
