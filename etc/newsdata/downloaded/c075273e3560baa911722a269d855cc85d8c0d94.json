Through the Union, one franc would worth be the same amount as one lira, peseta, leva, or drachma, and be easily exchangeable within the member nations. The Union was dissolved in 1927.\n\nA $4 coin was proposed by Congressman John Kasson of Iowa, who was appointed by President Rutherford B. Hayes as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1877. While there, he experienced difficulties in converting American dollars into Austrian florins and back again. Upon his return to the U.S., he submitted a proposal for a $4 coin that would be closer in weight to the Austro-Hungarian 8 florin piece, which was equivalent to the French 20 franc coin.\n\nThe back of $4 coin Courtesy of Stack's Bowers Galleries\n\nTwo designs were prepared, one featuring Flowing Hair by Charles E. Barber, and the other featuring Coiled Hair design by George T. Morgan. Barber's Flowing Hair design was the first selected for production and an estimated 25\u2014some estimate as few as 10 to 15\u2014were distributed to Congress leaders.\n\nIn 1880, the Mint struck more examples, estimated to be in the region of between 425 to 800 coins and all bearing the date 1879, for government officials. But the coin never was approved for regular full-scale production, according to Stack\u2019s Bowers Galleries.\n\n\u201cThe Stella represents an attempt to integrate the world\u2019s money as one,\u201d Brian Kendrella, president of Stack\u2019s Bowers Galleries, said in a statement. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t been able to do this even today but this coin represents the closest we likely ever came.\u201d\n\nThe coin offered for sale next month features the Flowing Hair design. A similar example sold for $411,250 in June 2012, and another for $384,000 in March 2018, both at Stack\u2019s Bowers Galleries auction in Baltimore. Those two were finer graded, though.", "description": "The denomination from 1879 was intended to be a universal currency, but didn\u2019t go into full production", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-119577/social", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
