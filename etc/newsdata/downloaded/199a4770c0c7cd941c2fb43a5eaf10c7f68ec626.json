A Singapore court ordered teenage blogger Yee to undergo a mental health re-evaluation, after he was found guilty on charges of offending Christians and spreading an obscene image online. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nTsang Chi-kin, also known as Tony Tsang, who was shot at close range on Tuesday as he fought officers with what appeared to be a white pole, has been charged with rioting, which carries a maximum 10-year sentence, and assaulting a police officer.\n\nThe prosecutor said Tsang was more violent than others who have attended recent rallies, which began after the government announced its intention to introduce an extradition law.\n\nThe proposed legislation, which would have meant the possibility of people facing trial in mainland courts, has been withdrawn but the protests have evolved into a broad pro-democracy movement.\n\nA judge set bail at HK$5000 ($640) and banned Tsang, who according to his lawyer is in a hospital intensive care unit in a stable condition, from leaving the country.\n\nAfter the hearing, hundreds of supporters, some crying, clapped and chanted \u201cthank you\u201d to the lawyer who represented him. They also opened umbrellas to form a tunnel outside the court to shield the identity of other arrested protesters who appeared in court.\n\nCecilia Ng, 53, said young people had sacrificed themselves to stop government wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cYes, they destroy things. But it was completely not necessary to shoot them,\u201d she said. \u201cThe point is that the government taught us that peaceful protest can never work. Now, the government pushes another evil law. Our city is on edge. Our teenagers are also on edge.\u201d\n\nMany of those gathered in the court and outside were wearing masks, in defiance of an expected government ban on the wearing of face-masks in public - as many protesters do to disguise their identities. The ban was announced a short while later.\n\nThe case was been adjourned until Nov. 14.", "description": "The 18-year-old protester shot in the chest by Hong Kong police this week was throwing bricks and \"rioting\" at the time he was wounded, a prosecutor told a court packed with his supporters on Friday.", "authors": ["Felix Tam", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436962065&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930NB", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
