These rinks, which once shouted the president's name, now barely mention it. \u201cThey've taken [the name] off everything. Off the uniforms, everything.\u201d\n\nMr Trump has run the rinks since the 1980s, under a concession from the city of New York.\n\nThey actually played a major role in the creation of Mr Trump as a national celebrity: in the 1980s, he took over a languishing city-run renovation project and famously finished the rink himself, on time and under budget.\n\nOfficially, they have other names: Wollman Rink in the southern part of the park, and Lasker Rink at the park's northern end. But Mr Trump displayed his name as prominently - or more prominently - than the official names.\n\nThe two rinks had been heavily branded with the Trump name through last winter's skating season.\n\nThis summer, a city spokeswoman said, the Trump Organisation decided to make a change.\n\n\u201cThe Trump organisation notified us in late August that they planned to change the on-rink branding,\u201d Crystal Howard, a spokeswoman for the city parks department, said in an email.\n\nShe said the city did not ask for the change and that the company did not explain why it did it.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Employees weren't sure if it would stay there, either. Croft, the parks watchdog, said an employee had told him it would come off.\n\nThe Trump Organisation did not respond to questions about the change.\n\nWhen a Post reporter visited the rink this week, one employee theorised that the decision was made because the Trump branding was driving some customers away.\n\n\u201cI do believe that's the answer. It was hurting business,\u201d the employee said. The employee spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media. \u201cA lot of the schools, you know, liberal private schools up here, come to parties up here. That was a big income earner up here Monday and Tuesday night.\u201d\n\nThe New York Post reported on one instance of that in early 2017: a skating party at the Wollman Rink for children from the elite Dalton School was cancelled, the paper reported, after some parents refused to let their children go to a rink emblazoned with Trump's name.\n\nMr Trump built an empire on branding, leaving his name on dozens of hotels, buildings and golf courses. Since Mr Trump took office, his name has been removed from three hotels and six Manhattan residential buildings. But those were other people's buildings, whose owners had paid to license the Trump name.\n\nThe ice rinks, by contrast, are run directly by Mr Trump's company. The change is their decision, the city said. The Post has not identified any other instances in which the Trump Organisation voluntarily removed so much Trump-branded signage from any property.\n\nThese ice rinks are - like many other Trump properties - marooned in a liberal city, far from the rural and exurban voters whom Mr Trump relies on as a politician.\n\nIn 2015, Mr Trump quickly reversed his public image, from a hotel owner who courted urban elites to a hard-right politician who denounced them.\n\nBut unlike Mr Trump's hotels in New York, Chicago and Doral, Florida, the Trump-branded ice rinks had not suffered declines since Mr Trump ran for office.\n\nIn fact, their income had risen about 12 percent from 2015 to 2018, according to figures provided by New York City. That was roughly in line with trends at other popular rinks in the city.\n\n\u201cI'm not going to not go because it's Donald Trump . . . even though I hate him and I don't want him to be my president,\u201d said Amy Townsend, 57, a visitor from Los Angeles who was walking in the park this week. She also said that even a Trump-branded ice rink wouldn't dissuade her from skating: \u201cIf I want to ice skate in this beautiful area, I'm going to do that.\u201d\n\nThe Wollman Rink played a significant role in the creation of Mr Trump as a local and national celebrity. In the 1980s, the city was mired in an over-budget, long-delayed renovation project.\n\nMr Trump, then known as a playboy real estate developer, offered to take the project over. He did, and finished it ahead of schedule. In return, Mr Trump got the valuable concession to run the rink - and a national reputation, as a businessman who talked big and got results.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time he's famous not for his nightlife, but for improving urban civic life,\u201d said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University.\n\n\u201cYou know what this tells me?\u201d Ms Moss said of the removal of the Trump-branded signs. \u201cHe's a businessman. He knows the name Wollman [Rink] is better without Trump.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "Two of Donald Trump's oldest businesses - a pair of ice rinks in Central Park, which the US preisdent has run since the 1980s - have started removing his name from their branding.\u00a0 As skating season begins, the president's name is gone from the boards around each rink, where large red \u201cTRUMP\u201d signs once surrounded skaters.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "David A Fahrenthold"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/23/10/central-park-wollman-ice-rink.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
