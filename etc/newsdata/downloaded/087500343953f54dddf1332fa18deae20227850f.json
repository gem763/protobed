As soon as Gabbard\u2019s name was mentioned, Sellers took the opportunity to claim that there \u201cis a chance that Tulsi\u2019s not just working for the United States of America.\"\n\n.@Bakari_Sellers: \"There is no question that Tulsi Gabbard is a puppet for the Russian government.\" pic.twitter.com/a5qtVjFu2i \u2014 chris evans (@notcapnamerica) October 15, 2019\n\nThe dramatic accusation prompted uncomfortable shuffling from the rest of the panel, with CNN contributor April Ryan asking \u201cohh, wait a minute, what?\u201d Sitting opposite Sellers, commentator Angela Rye jumped in to stress that any accusations of Gabbard working for a foreign power are just \u201can allegation.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com As she enters White House race, demonization of \u2018Kremlin\u2019s crush\u2019 Tulsi Gabbard goes full tilt\n\nSellers was not content to quit, however, adding that it was \u201cnot just an allegation\u201d \u2014 despite the fact that there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that Gabbard is compromised by any foreign country.\n\nThen Sellers got into the specifics.\n\nThere's no question, there is no question that Tulsi Gabbard, of all the 12 [debate participants], is a puppet for the Russian government.\n\n\u201cHow is there no question?\u201d host Alisyn Camerota asked, seemingly taken aback by the seriousness of the claim. Sellers instantly cited Gabbard\u2019s position on the war in Syria as proof.\n\nIndeed, the unapologetically anti-war candidate has faced similar smears of being an \u201cAssad apologist\u201d and a \u201cPutin puppet\u201d multiple times due to her criticisms of US foreign policy in Syria, where she believes Washington should never have backed and funded jihadist rebels fighting President Bashar Assad.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Neocon warmongers\u2019: NBC slammed for drawing on dodgy Russiagate org in Gabbard smear\n\nAs for Sellers himself, he has endorsed California Senator Kamala Harris for president, so his distaste for Gabbard is not entirely surprising. Gabbard won broad praise for expertly taking Harris to task on her record as a prosecutor during an earlier debate \u2014 so much so that the hashtag #KamalaHarrisDestroyed even trended on Twitter (but that was apparently Russia\u2019s fault, too).\n\nWhile Sellers did face some mild pushback from the CNN panel, none of the participants rushed to wholeheartedly defend Gabbard, either. The analyst did experience the wrath of Twitter, however.\n\nJournalist Max Blumenthal tweeted that Sellers comment was somewhat ironic since he is \"an actual puppet for corporate America and AIPAC.\" Sellers is an activist for the pro-Israel AIPAC lobbying organization, which is accused of waging outsized influence in US domestic politics and foreign policy.\n\nInvestigative journalist Glenn Greenwald called Sellers' comments \"repugnant, McCarthyite accusations of treason\" and noted that the CNN panel moved quickly on and would surely allow him back to repeat the same smears on another occasion.\n\nAgain, the rules for Dem Party/MSNBC/CNN discourse are repugnant, defamatory and grotesque: anyone - even war veterans - who criticizes establishment Dems is fair game to be accused of treason, being a Kremlin agent & hating the US. No smears are off limits; no evidence required. pic.twitter.com/J6Urn3xzfD \u2014 Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) October 15, 2019\n\n\u201cIf there were a shred of proof that she is working for the Russian government she would be in a whole world of trouble,\u201d another user wrote, noting that Gabbard is a major in the National Guard and a member of congress with top secret security clearance.\n\nAlso on rt.com Who do you trust more? NBC journalist\u2019s stab at RT backfires spectacularly\n\nThe anti-Gabbard smears have been bubbling in mainstream media since before she even announced her candidacy, but they went into overdrive after she entered the race for president.\n\nNBC has accused her of being supported by Russian trolls on Twitter, while the New York Times recently published a hit piece in the \u2018news\u2019 section, headlined: \u201cWhat, Exactly, Is Tulsi Gabbard Up To?\u201d The piece speculated that Gabbard\u2019s anti-interventionist stances might somehow make her a Russian stooge, even citing coverage of her campaign by RT of all news organizations as some kind of proof.\n\nGabbard also won no friends within the Democratic Party in 2016 after she stepped down as DNC vice chair, endorsed Bernie Sanders and accused the party of bias in favor of Hillary Clinton.\n\nGabbard has continued her criticism of her party during this election cycle, too \u2014 so it\u2019s no wonder that the mainstream media and Democratic establishment haven\u2019t exactly warmed to her candidacy.\n\nLike this story?
