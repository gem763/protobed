At least based on his early morning, executive-time tweeting.\n\nMr Trump is facing pressure from an impeachment inquiry in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, stemming from his efforts to get Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a possible opponent for Mr Trump in next year's general election. Polling has shown a recent increase in support for that inquiry following a cascade of revelations about how the administration and Mr Trump's outside lawyer tried to dig up dirt on Mr Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nWhat had Mr Trump particularly incensed on Thursday morning was a new poll from a cable network that's generally generous in its estimations of his presidency.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cFrom the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll. Whoever their Pollster is, they suck,\u201d Mr Trump tweeted. \u201cBut @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days.\u201d\n\nIt's not true that Mr Trump has never had a good poll from Fox's pollsters; in January 2016, he celebrated a Fox poll that showed him leading in the Iowa caucuses. Nor is it the case that Fox's poll team generally mirrors the network's coverage. The pollsters represent the sort of objective analysis that the network's pundits only claim to espouse.\n\nThat said, it's not surprising that Mr Trump is particularly angry about the new results.\n\n1. The poll shows that a majority of Americans want to see Mr Trump removed from office.\n\nThe top-line numbers are some of the worst Mr Trump has seen on the question of impeachment and removal from office. In the Fox News poll, 51% of respondents said that Trump should be both impeached and removed, with 4% saying he should be impeached but not removed.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower.

As Trump\u2019s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president\u2019s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy. In a series of eccentric TV appearances he has claimed that the US state department asked him to get involved. Giuliani insists that he is fighting corruption on Trump\u2019s behalf and has called himself a \u201chero\u201d. AP 5/19 Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin. AFP/Getty 6/19 Mike Pence The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later. However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year. Getty 8/19 Joe Biden The former vice-president is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination, which would make him Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2020 election. Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant. Reuters 9/19 Hunter Biden Joe Biden\u2019s son has been accused of corruption by the president because of his business dealings in Ukraine and China. However, Trump has yet to produce any evidence of corruption and Biden\u2019s lawyer insists he has done nothing wrong. AP 10/19 William Barr The attorney-general, who proved his loyalty to Trump with his handling of the Mueller report, was mentioned in the Ukraine call as someone president Volodymyr Zelensky should talk to about following up Trump\u2019s preoccupations with the Biden\u2019s and the Clinton emails. Nancy Pelosi has accused Barr of being part of a \u201ccover-up of a cover-up\u201d.

He has since suggested that asking foreign leaders for favours is simply how international politics works.

On September 24, amid reports of the Ukraine call and the day before the White House released a partial transcript of it, she relented and announced an inquiry, saying: \u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d Getty 13/19 Adam Schiff Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, one of the three committees leading the inquiry. He was criticized by Republicans for giving what he called a \u201cparody\u201d of the Ukraine phone call during a hearing, with Trump and others saying he had been pretending that his damning characterisation was a verbatim reading of the phone call. He has also been criticised for claiming that his committee had had no contact with the whistleblower, only for it to emerge that the intelligence agent had contacted a staff member on the committee for guidance before filing the complaint. The Washington Post awarded Schiff a \u201cfour Pinocchios\u201d rating, its worst rating for a dishonest statement.

Getty\n\nAmong suburban women, a constituency that is of ongoing concern for Republicans, nearly six in 10 support Mr Trump's removal. Even more than one in 10 Republicans - and 12% of people who voted for Mr Trump - think he should be ousted.\n\nMore than half of respondents said they thought Mr Trump is more focused on doing what serves himself best as opposed to what best serves the country. Nearly a fifth of Republicans said that they think Mr Trump is focused more on Mr Trump than the country.\n\n2. Americans find Mr Trump's actions on Ukraine particularly troubling.\n\nAsked their views about what Mr Trump did - specifically, asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Mr Biden - most respondents said that the request was \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d troubling. Even a fifth of Republicans said it was at least \u201cvery\u201d troubling that Mr Trump made the request.\n\nMr Trump and his allies have been arguing that the request was solely a function of Mr Trump's desire to see possible corruption uprooted. It's an argument that suffers from two distinct problems: There's not strong evidence that Mr Biden was engaged in anything close to corruption, and there's no evidence that Mr Trump has put a focus on corruption anywhere that a prominent Democrat wasn't involved.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Fully 40% of Republicans think it's inappropriate for Mr Trump to ask foreign leaders to investigate political rivals - nearly twice as many as find the Ukraine situation troubling. This suggests, perhaps, that some supporters accept the idea that Mr Trump wasn't looking to undermine Mr Biden specifically.\n\nBut the numbers above are grim for Mr Trump as an impeachment inquiry moves forward. Unearthing additional evidence suggesting that Mr Trump's goal was solely to undercut Mr Biden could presumably increase the number of people who consider Mr Trump's actions out of bound. (Assuming the normal rules of political scandal apply, which may not be a fair assumption.)\n\n3. Views of the situation among Republicans are complicated.\n\nThirteen per cent of Republicans believe that Mr Trump should be impeached and removed from office. That's a big chunk of the president's own party - 1 in 8 Republicans. But it's not many relative to the population overall.\n\nFox's pollsters asked those Republicans why they didn't think Mr Trump should be impeached.\n\n- 22% of those who opposed impeachment said Mr Trump did nothing wrong.\n\n- 22% said the impeachment push was a politically motivated attack.\n\n- 17% said there was a lack of evidence.\n\n- 12% said they approve of the job he's doing.\n\n- 10% said that what Mr Trump did wasn't impeachable.\n\nThat 17% is interesting, implying (as we just noted) that more evidence might sway them. As it stands, 9% of Republicans see the Ukraine call as impeachable, with another 38% calling it inappropriate.\n\nThere's a broad sense that this is political. Eighty-one per cent of Republicans think Democrats just want to hurt Mr Trump politically. About six in 10 Republicans think that Republicans in Congress oppose impeachment because they think Mr Trump did nothing wrong.\n\nThe flip sides of those questions are interesting, too. Only 11% of Republicans think that Democrats sincerely think Mr Trump did something impeachable. But about a quarter of Republicans think that members of their party are opposing impeachment to protect the president.\n\n4. There remains a significant gender gap in views of what happened.\n\nOn the questions of both approval of Mr Trump's job performance and impeachment, there are big gaps between men and women. Men are 13 points more likely to approve of Mr Trump's job performance; women are 13 points more likely to want to see him booted from office.\n\nSome of the broadest gaps are among white people with college degrees. More than half of white men with degrees approve of Mr Trump's job performance while only about a third of white women with degrees do, a 20-point gap. White women with degrees are 14 points more likely to want to see Mr Trump impeached and removed.\n\n5. Fox News has covered its poll less than other networks.\n\nOne small detail that should relieve Mr Trump: His favourite network is talking about the results of the poll less than other networks.\n\nA search of mentions of either \u201cFox News poll\u201d or \u201c51 per cent\u201d since the poll was released Thursday evening shows that Fox News and Fox Business have mentioned it less frequently than CNN or MSNBC, particularly when including overnight reruns of shows.\n\nWhen Fox News does cover the poll, its coverage can be a bit different in tone than the other networks.\n\n\u201cPolls are showing support for impeachment,\u201d host Laura Ingraham said. \u201cAnd the polls are not going in the way the president wants them to go. If you believe the polls, you don't believe the polls - including a poll done by Fox News. A thousand registered voters called randomly on cellphones and home phones. Supposedly 51% say they want the president either impeached or removed.\u201d\n\n\u201cSupposedly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you believe the polls.\u201d\n\nOn Fox & Friends on Thursday morning, a reporter noted that support for impeachment had increased since a July Fox poll. \u201cSince then a lot has happened,\u201d he said, \u201cmost notably, of course, the House Democrats launching the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nThe last Fox News poll was released 25 July, the day that something else notable happened: that call between Trump and the Ukrainian president.\n\n\u200bThe Washington Post", "description": "For not the first time in recent weeks, President Donald Trump woke up angry.
