The Spectacled Flowerpecker has drawn major attention since it was first photographed and described by a group of birdwatchers in 2009. US researchers managed to capture on for study in 2019. It lives in the jungles of Borneo, near the mistletoe trees on which it feeds. It has a stout, pot-bellied body and stubby bill that are typical of flowerpeckers. However, the small grey birds is not closely related to the other species in its family.\n\n'This bird is totally unique,' said Christopher Milensky, leader of the Smithsonian survey that led to the new discovery.\n\n'It's unlike anything else, and it is the latest example of the rich biodiversity that can be found in this region.'\n\nThe tropical island of Borneo in South East Asia is home to hundreds of species of birds, including dozens that are seen nowhere else in the world.\n\nThe Spectacled Flowerpecker has drawn major attention since it was first photographed and described by a group of birdwatchers in 2009.\n\nThe bird's stout, pot-bellied body and stubby bill immediately suggested that it was a Flowerpecker.\n\nHowever, its distinctive facial markings \u2014 the prominent white arcs above and below its eyes that give the bird its bespectacled appearance \u2014 were unfamiliar.\n\nThe birdwatching group, which included Professor Edwards, dubbed the bird the Spectacled Flowerpecker and proposed that it might be a species new to science.\n\nFor the next 10 years, birds matching the description of the Spectacled Flowerpecker have been spotted periodically in lowland forests around the island.\n\nAlthough it was not until earlier this year, when the American team found the elusive bird in a remote wildlife preserve in South Western Borneo, that scientists had a chance to study it directly.\n\nThe Spectacled Flowerpecker was first spotted 2009 by a team of birdwatchers including ornithologist David Edwards, presently of the University of Sheffield\n\nThe Smithsonian researchers were collaborating with Malaysia's Sarawak Forestry Corporation on a survey of the diversity of bird species living in the Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary on the northwest of the island.\n\nThe team's chosen research site was miles from any reported Spectacled Flowerpecker sightings, so discovering one came as a surprise.\n\nHowever, Mr Milensky said he recognised it immediately.\n\n'I was fairly certain that's what it was, and I knew it had not been formally described and documented,' he said.\n\n'As soon as I saw it, I knew we had a new species of bird to describe.'\n\nNow a team from the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in the US has become the first to capture and study the small, grey bird\n\nThe researchers returned to the Smithsonian Museum to examine the bird closely \u2014 analysing its external features and comparing its DNA to that of other flowerpeckers.\n\nTheir genetic analysis turned up another surprise, however, revealing that the new bird was very different from its family members.\n\n'It isn't related to any of the other flowerpeckers all that closely,' said Smithsonian team leader Jacob Saucier.\n\n'It's a whole new species that distinctly stands out.'\n\nLike other flowerpeckers, the new species has been spotted eating mistletoe, a parasitic plant that grows high in the forest canopy.\n\nThe Spectacled Flowerpecker has drawn major attention since it was first photographed and described by a group of birdwatchers in Borneo \u2014 at location F in the above \u2014 in 2009\n\nThrough DNA analysis and close inspection of seeds from the bird's gut, the team were able to identify the type of mistletoe that the bird eats.\n\nThis information gives researchers a new perspective on this bird's ecological needs and habitat preferences.\n\n'We think that wherever primary forest and mistletoe occur, there's a good chance this bird could be there,' said Mr Saucier.\n\nThe researchers hope that their discovery will bring attention to the unexplored diversity that remains in the forests of Borneo \u2014 along with the importance of conserving such threatened ecosystems.\n\nThe scientific name that the team chose for the Spectacled Flowerpecker \u2014 Dicaeum dayakorum \u2014 honours the Dayaks, the people who live in and are working to protect the island's forests.\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal Zootaxa.\n\nThe team's chosen research site was miles from any reported Spectacled Flowerpecker sightings, so discovering one came as a surprise\n\nThe tropical island of Borneo in South East Asia is home to hundreds of species of birds, including dozens that are seen nowhere else in the world\n\n\n\n", "description": "The Smithsonian researchers were doing a survey of the diversity of bird species living in the Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary on the northwest of Borneo when they captured the bird.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/17/19847078-0-image-a-94_1571329303024.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
