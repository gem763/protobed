It would provide a solid base from which to get the deal approved as it faces several more votes from lawmakers.\n\nHowever, Parliament could decide to subject it to more detailed scrutiny that could drag out or even derail his plans to split with the EU by the end of the month.\n\n\u201cWhat is the alternative action available to us?\u201d Mr. Johnson told lawmakers as he rallied them round the deal. \u201cTo undo Brexit?\u201d\n\nMr. Johnson said he would pull his Brexit deal altogether if Parliament attempted to block its progress and delayed ratification until January.\n\nA victory in the vote wouldn\u2019t on its own bring to an end the protracted deadlock on how and when the U.K. should break from the EU: Lawmakers will vote later Tuesday whether to accept his government\u2019s preferred timetable of just three days to make the legislation law, and will likely balk at waving the deal through so quickly. That will give Mr. Johnson\u2019s opponents further opportunities to try to amend or frustrate the deal.\n\nMr. Johnson\u2019s government argues that after three years of political wrangling, Brexit needs to be concluded. He wants Parliament to approve it at record speed, with lawmakers wrapping up deliberations on the bill by Thursday and the House of Lords working over the weekend to get it over the line. Britain\u2019s departure from the EU has been delayed twice since 2016\u2019s referendum and Mr. Johnson is loath to delay once more.\n\n\u201cI will in no way allow months more of this,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated Video WSJ\u2019s Saabira Chaudhuri takes a look at what a no-deal Brexit could look like for businesses and consumers.\n\nGovernment officials are confident they have the votes in the House of Commons to pass the deal, though margins are slim. If they fail, the Brexit impasse would likely have to be resolved through a general election.\n\nEven if the deal passes, lawmakers could vote to slow down scrutiny of the law, jeopardizing Mr. Johnson\u2019s pledge to get the U.K. out of the EU by the current deadline of Oct. 31. Any delay beyond that date would need to be agreed by the 27 other EU governments\u2014though their agreement is highly likely.\n\nIf lawmakers do approve the accelerated timetable, they could hold further votes to try to change the legislation.\n\nLawmakers have already begun publishing proposed amendments to the agreement. Former Conservative legislator Kenneth Clarke, now an independent lawmaker, wants the U.K. to be more closely bound to the EU, remaining in a customs union with the bloc after Brexit.\n\nOther amendments expected to be voted on include one to subject the deal to a public referendum, offering the option of staying in the EU. It is unclear whether either of these proposals will garner a majority, but they will need time to be debated.\n\nGiven that this summer British lawmakers spent nearly a month debating a law to ban the use of wild animals in traveling circuses, passing a law that will define Britain\u2019s split with its biggest trade partner in just a few days is a tall order, analysts say.\n\nFurthermore, some details are scant: The U.K. Treasury hasn\u2019t published an assessment of economic impact it would have on the U.K., for instance.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nPrevious EU related laws have taken a long time to pass. The EU Withdrawal Act, which paved the way for the U.K. leave the bloc, took up 273 hours of parliamentary time. The Maastricht treaty, which accelerated the integration of the European bloc in the early 1990s, was debated for 21 days in Parliament.\n\nIf the government\u2019s proposed schedule is voted down, it could propose another timetable after consulting with lawmakers. Or it could simply try to curtail the ongoing debate when the deadline approaches by tabling a special motion, which again would be subject to voting.\n\nAnother issue is what happens after Brexit.\n\nCurrently Britain is due to enter a transition period with the EU up until the end of 2020\u2014with possible further extensions until the end of 2022\u2014while the two sides negotiate a trade deal.\n\nSome lawmakers fear the U.K. won\u2019t have negotiated a comprehensive trade deal with the EU by the end of next year and fear a cliff edge in which Britain\u2019s ties with its biggest trading partner will be severely curtailed. They want a guarantee the U.K. will ask to extend the transition period until 2022, a step pro-Brexit lawmakers oppose.\n\nWrite to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com", "description": "Britain\u2019s prime minister could be on the cusp of an important victory if Parliament\u2019s vote goes his way, but obstacles remain.", "authors": ["Max Colchester", "Max.Colchester Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-119347/social", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
