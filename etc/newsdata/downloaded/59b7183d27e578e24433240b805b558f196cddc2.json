At the time, she wished to remain anonymous for fear of personal safety and professional repercussions.\n\nThe same day Lauer was fired, Variety broke additional stories from multiple other women of Lauer\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct at NBC, and revealed that his alleged serial sexual predation was not a secret at the company.\n\nLauer emphatically denied the new allegations in a letter published Wednesday, in which he admits to having had an extramarital affair with Nevils but says the rape accusation is \u201cdangerous and defamatory\u201d and \u201ccategorically false.\u201d\n\nNBC News responded to the book excerpts Wednesday, calling his behavior \u201cappalling, horrific and reprehensible,\u201d the network said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague.\u201d\n\nLauer\u2019s former colleagues, \u201cToday\u201d show hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, also responded on Wednesday\u2019s broadcast of the show.\n\n\u201cThis is shocking and appalling, and I honestly don\u2019t even know what to say about it,\u201d Guthrie said. \u201cI know it wasn\u2019t easy for our colleague Brooke to come forward then. It\u2019s not easy now, and we support her and any other women who have come forward with claims.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are not allegations of an affair,\u201d Kotb said. \u201cThey\u2019re allegations of a crime. And I think that\u2019s shocking to all of us here, who\u2019ve sat with Matt for many, many years. I think we\u2019re going to just sort of continue to process this part of this horrific story.\u201d\n\nAccording to Variety, Nevils told Farrow that Lauer anally raped her after a night of drinks with him and former \u201cToday\u201d show host Meredith Vieira, then a contributing host for the network\u2019s Olympics coverage, and with whom Nevils was working at the time.\n\nNevils told Farrow that she went to Lauer\u2019s hotel room to get her press credential. Lauer then invited her back for a second time, and she went because, according to Farrow, Nevils \u201chad no reason to suspect Lauer would be anything but friendly based on prior experience.\u201d\n\nThe excerpt from Variety goes on to detail the alleged rape.\n\nOnce she was in his hotel room, Nevils alleges, Lauer \u2014 who was wearing a T-shirt and boxers \u2014 pushed her against the door and kissed her. He then pushed her onto the bed, \u201cflipping her over, asking if she liked anal sex,\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cShe said that she declined several times.\u201d According to Nevils, she \u201cwas in the midst of telling him she wasn\u2019t interested again when he \u2018just did it,\u2019\u201d Farrow writes.\n\nNevils told Farrow that she informed many people about the incident, including her superiors. When she moved to a different part of the company, she also told one of her new bosses, but no one took action, according to the excerpt.\n\n\u201cThis was no secret,\u201d Farrow writes in the book, according to Variety.\n\nIt was only after October 2017, when Farrow \u2014 along with New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey \u2014 reported on the years of sexual abuse allegations against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, catalyzing the Me Too movement, that Nevils\u2019 story came to light.\n\nAccording to Farrow\u2019s book, NBC colleagues were reminded of Nevils\u2019 claim and began asking her about it. She then told Vieira about the incident, who told her to get a lawyer and report the alleged rape to NBC\u2019s HR department, which led to Lauer\u2019s firing.\n\nAt the time, Nevils\u2019 lawyer accused NBC of not doing enough to protect her and honor her request for confidentiality. Farrow\u2019s book reveals that other employees were able to figure out that the anonymous accuser was Nevils.\n\nWhen she left the network, according to Farrow, executives \u201cproposed a script she would have to read, suggesting that she had left to pursue other endeavors, that she was treated well, and that NBC News was a positive example of sexual harassment.\u201d\n\nLauer\u2019s firing also exposed NBC\u2019s mishandling of the allegations, as many staffers had warned leadership of Lauer\u2019s alleged misconduct, but the network failed to act, citing the fact that no one made any formal complaints against him. However, an internal investigation detailed that many employees described a culture of fear.\n\n\u201cCatch and Kill\u201d also details NBC News\u2019 attempts to dissuade and impede Farrow \u2015 then an employee \u2015 from investigating Weinstein\u2019s alleged serial sexual misconduct. Farrow later took that reporting to The New Yorker. His work, along with that of Kantor and Twohey, uncovered decades of allegations against the movie mogul and attempted cover-ups by him and the people in his orbit. The ensuing Me Too reckoning exposed other alleged sexual predators and powerful institutions that looked the other way, including Lauer and NBC News.\n\nThis story has been updated with Lauer\u2019s denial.", "description": "Details of the alleged 2014 incident, including the accuser's identity, were revealed in excerpts from Ronan Farrow's book \"Catch and Kill.\"", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9ddff42100005009acbc9b.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
