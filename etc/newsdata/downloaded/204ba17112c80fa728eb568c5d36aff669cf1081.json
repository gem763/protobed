It seeks to comfort without compassion,\" he added.\n\n\"A gauzy, bloated slab of Oscar bait\" is how the movie was described by Dave Ehrlich in IndieWire.\n\nBenjamin Lee of The Guardian was more lenient, describing it as \"neither a rousing success nor an embarrassing failure\".\n\nJeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros, which co-financed the film with Amazon, said the film was not what audiences wanted.\n\n\"The audience wasn't interested in seeing this literary work on screen,\" he told Variety.\n\n\"There were many things that didn't work, but the biggest was probably the marketplace.\"\n\nThe Goldfinch opens in the UK on 27 September.\n\nWorst North American opening weekends to date (between 2,500 and 3,000 cinemas since 1982)\n\n1.
