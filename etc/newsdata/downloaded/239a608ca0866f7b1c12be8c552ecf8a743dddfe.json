REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo\n\nThe world\u2019s top iron ore consumer brought in 99.36 million tonnes of the mineral last month, the biggest purchase since January 2018, Reuters calculations showed. That was up 4.8% from 94.85 million tonnes in August and compared with 93.47 million tonnes a year earlier.\n\nFor the first nine months of the year, arrivals of the key steelmaking ingredient totaled 784 million tonnes, down 2.4% from 803.34 million tonnes in the same period a year ago.\n\nDemand for iron ore at China\u2019s steel mills has been firm despite some curbs last month when China implemented special measures to cut factory pollution ahead of celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic on Oct. 1.\n\nUtilization rates at steel mills across China were around 68% in the first three weeks of September, but fell to 57.6% in the final week, the lowest on record since August 2012, data compiled by consultancy Mysteel showed.\n\n\u201cThe curbs ahead of National Day were strict but were a one-off,\u201d said Zhao Yu, analyst with Huatai Futures, speaking before data was released, noting that steel output has been running at high levels this year.\n\n\u201cShipments from Brazil and Australia that were due to discharged in China last month were stable,\u201d she added.\n\nStocks of iron ore at China\u2019s major ports stood at 125.55 million tonnes as of end-September, little changed from end-August, data compiled by consultancy SteelHome showed.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Ecology and Environment said in September it would set stricter targets for polluting cities for this year\u2019s autumn-winter heating season.\n\nBut analysts don\u2019t expect a major impact on steel production.\n\n\u201cSteel mills have adapted to the pace and measures of output curbs over the past few years, so actual influence on production could be relatively small,\u201d Zhao said.", "description": "China's iron ore imports rose for a third straight month in September to a 20-month high, according to customs data released on Monday, fueled by firm demand at steel mills and stable shipments from big miners.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440581959&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D05L", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
