The Turkish leader has humiliated Trump and the U.S. in recent weeks and months. He went ahead with the purchase of a Russian S-400 air defense system this summer, over several U.S. objections, and has faced no sanctions. He ordered his military to violate an earlier safe-haven agreement that to which Turkey had previously agreed. His forces fired artillery on a U.S. outpost last week. And he has metaphorically \u2014 and literally, according to the BBC \u2014 thrown Trump\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy\u201d letter into the trash.\n\nIn exchange for this disrespect and petulance, Erdogan got what he has wanted all along. He started a war to create a buffer zone in northern Syria, then got the U.S. to agree that he be allowed to keep it. Trump is even now repeating Erdogan\u2019s talking points, claiming (without evidence) that the Syrian Kurds have launched attacks into Turkey. \u201cIn all fairness they\u2019ve had a legitimate problem with it,\u201d Trump said Thursday, referring to the safe zone. \u201cThey had to have it cleaned out. But once you start that, it gets to a point where a tremendous amount of bad things can happen.\u201d\n\nThat point has already been reached. Bad things are indeed happening, and will continue to happen. And there\u2019s little reason to believe Trump\u2019s capitulation in Ankara will do much to stop them.", "description": "", "authors": ["Eli Lake", "Finance.Yahoo.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
