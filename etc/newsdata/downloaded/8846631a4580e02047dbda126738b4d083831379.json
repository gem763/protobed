In mid 2018, there were 1.6 million people aged 85 years and over; by mid 2043, this is projected to nearly double to 3 million.\n\nThe data has prompted concern from elderly care charities and campaigners who fear that an ageing population is set to deepen an ever-worsening social care crisis.\n\nDeborah Alsina MBE, Chief Executive of Independent Age, said: \u201cPeople across England are navigating a social care system that is in crisis. As our society ages, and more people rely on this system, it is vital that high quality services are in place to support people at the right time.", "description": "The number of over 85s in the UK is set to double within the next 25 years, new data reveals, amid fears of the social care crisis escalating.", "authors": ["Gabriella Swerling", "Social Affairs Editor", "Rosa Prince", "Tom Harris", "Stephen Pollard"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/09/TELEMMGLPICT000143955677-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqplGOf-dgG3z4gg9owgQTXPGkjMqXV6CT_ASrwFoxoSc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
