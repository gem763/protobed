She was naive. I still think that now.\n\n(Image: Instgram)\n\n\"I said, 'This is serious. This is the end of your normal life, the end of your privacy \u2013 everything.\"\n\nHowever Gina claims that Meghan wasn't interested in her advice, saying she \"didn't want to hear any negativity\" at what was a \"happy time\" for her and Harry.\n\nGina has not spoken or heard anything from her pal since a week before Meghan and Harry's engagement announcement.\n\nTheir last contact was via a lawyer who ended their professional connections.\n\nMeghan spoke about the pressures of her new royal life in an emotional interview as part of the ITV documentary Harry and Meghan: An African Adventure.\n\nShe said: \"Look, any woman especially when they are pregnant you\u2019re really vulnerable and so that was made really challenging, and then when you have a newborn \u2013 you know.\n\n(Image: @krugercowne/Twitter)\n\n\"And especially as a woman, it\u2019s a lot. So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed it\u2019s, well\u2026\"\n\nShe then cuts to thank Tom for checking how she is doing.\n\n\"And, also thank you for asking, because not many people have asked if I\u2019m OK. But it\u2019s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\"\n\nFollowing up on her answer, Tom asks: \"And the answer is, would it be fair to say, not really OK, as in it\u2019s really been a struggle?\"\n\nMeghan pauses before replying simply: \"Yes\".\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nGina has spoken about her friend a number of times, including details of her excitement in the lead up to their first date .\n\nShe said: \"Meghan had just told me, 'I'm going on a date tonight, with Prince Harry!' I looked at how stunning she was and I just thought: 'There's no way he's going to be able to resist her.'\n\n\"I couldn't believe what I was hearing but I think she could barely believe it either.\n\n\"We were both extremely excited. I jokingly asked if she knew what she was letting herself in for and she said: 'Well, it's going to be an experience and at least it will be a fun night.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nShe's also described her as a \"delightful, warm, personable - and hugely charismatic\" but warned that she doesn't tolerate negativity.\n\nShe described Meghan as being \"so focused on what she wants\" and claims the Duchess \"changed\" when things began to get serious with her future husband.\n\nGina put a perceived tension and \"anxiety\" surrounding Meghan down to a busy work schedule which interfered with her growing relationship.\n\nDuring a trip to Ottawa to attend a One Young World event in September 2016, Gina said Meghan gave her a \"bit of a difficult time\".", "description": "Meghan Markle met her friend and agent Gina Nelthorpe-Cowne for lunch just hours before her first date with Prince Harry, and she could tell when things were getting serious", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Instgram", "Krugercowne Twitter", "Itv", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20699626.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Meghans-friend-says-she-warned-her-about-being-a-royal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
