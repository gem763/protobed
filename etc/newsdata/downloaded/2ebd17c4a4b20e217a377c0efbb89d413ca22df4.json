(Nathan Gross/CBC)\n\n\"A lie because none of what [Premier Jason] Kenney ran on is in this budget,\" Notley said. \"He's not creating jobs. He is cutting front-line services and he raised taxes and fees on Albertans.\"\n\nAlberta is projected to end the 2019-20 financial year with an $8.7 billion deficit, up from $6.7 billion for 2018-19.\n\nThe higher deficit is mostly due to the cancellation of the crude-by-rail contracts put in place by the previous government. The budget estimates the costs of transferring rail contracts to the private sector at $1.5 billion.\n\nThe province's debt is forecast to reach $71.8 billion by the end of the year.\n\nThe government intends to cut the size of the nearly 28,000-member public service by 7.7 per cent by 2023.\n\nJob losses this year \u2014 achieved mostly through not replacing people who quit or retire \u2014 will be 764 full-time equivalents.\n\nThe aim is to reduce spending on public service salaries by 2.1 per cent by 2022-23. Toews said there will be no room for wage increases in the budget over the next three years.\n\nThe province is removing indexing for non-refundable tax credits and taxation brackets, which is estimated to save more than $600 million by the end of 2022-23.\n\nPeople who smoke will pay an additional $5 for a carton of cigarettes as of midnight. Fees for land titles and motor vehicles will also increase. For example, the cost of registering a vehicle will go from $75 to $80. The application fee for the Alberta Immigrant Nominee program is set at $500. It was previously free.\n\nAdvanced Education will see a five per cent budget cut and the government will end the five-year freeze on tuition, with increases limited to an annual maximum of seven per cent a year or 21 per cent over three years.\n\nStudents will also pay more for their student loans. Interest is currently set at prime but the government is changing the rate to prime plus one per cent. The province is also ending education and tuition tax credits in the 2020 tax year.\n\nPost-secondary institutions will also have their operating grants cut by up to 7.9 per cent. The amounts will be based on each institution's financial capacity and will be revealed later Thursday.\n\nMunicipalities take a hit\n\nMillions will be spent to support people who choose to take training in trades.\n\nPeople who receive social assistance programs like the Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped (AISH) and Income Support will no longer have their payments indexed to the Consumer Price Index, which will save $10 million this year.\n\nNotley said it was \"immoral\" for the government to give a tax breaks to large corporations while cutting about $30 each month to AISH recipients who she says struggle to make ends meet on $1,600 a month.\n\n\"It shows what kind of person this premier is and it shows the values of this government,\" Notley said.\n\nMunicipalities will take a sizeable hit to the funding they receive to pay for infrastructure. The Municipal Sustainability Initiative, or MSI, will be cut by $94 million in 2020-21 and $142 million in 2021-22.\n\nIn the 2018-19 NDP budget, MSI was pegged at $694 million, meaning it will come down to $600 million in 2020-21. In 2021-22, that figure will drop from $667.2 million to $535.2 million.\n\nThe province will also cut the grants it provides in lieu of taxes for municipal buildings.\n\nEdmonton, which as the provincial capital has the most government buildings, will see a $15.3 million cut in 2020-21. Calgary, by comparison, will only see a $5 million reduction.\n\nCalgary, Edmonton city charters repealed\n\nThe government also intends to repeal the city charters for Edmonton and Calgary, opting for a new program that will apply to all municipalities starting in 2022-23. Alberta's two largest cities would see their base spending reduced by $45 million a year.\n\nA couple of major projects have been cancelled or delayed. The new southwest Edmonton hospital, which was supposed to be completed by 2027, won't be finished until 2030.\n\nThe government will also chop the new $122-million Provincial Operations Centre but will maintain the $3 billion committed for LRT in Edmonton and Calgary.\n\nThe majority of provincial funds for the LRT expansions will however come after 2022-23.\n\nDespite the cuts, the government will spend $30 million on the new Canadian Energy Centre, otherwise known as the energy war room, and $2.5 million on the public inquiry examining foreign sources of funding for opponents of Alberta oil and gas.\n\nThe government will increase funding in some areas, spending an additional $100 million on mental health, $40 million to fight opioid addictions and $20 million on palliative care over four years.\n\nThe government will fund this year's 2.2 per-cent increase in education enrolment, but said it is working on a new funding framework in time for the 2020/21 school year.\n\nAlberta plans to build or retrofit 25 schools over the next four years.\n\nThe province plans to combine the Alberta Child Benefit and the Alberta Family Employment Tax Credit into a single Alberta Child and Family Benefit.\n\nOverall government revenue will stay at about $50 billion for the next two years, increasing to $53 billion in 2021-22 and $57.5 billion in 2022-23. Expenses are estimated at $56.5 billion in 2019-20, and then around $55 billion in each of the following three years.\n\nThe government is forecasting the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate to range from $57 US this year to $63 by 2022-23.\n\nThe government started a phased reduction of the corporate tax which will take the rate from 12 to eight per cent by 2022. Toews said the tax cut will incentivize business to set up in Alberta, and will increase revenues by $4 billion by the end of 2023.", "description": "Alberta will cut public sector jobs, end the cap on post-secondary tuition, chop municipal funding and delay infrastructure projects, all with the aim of returning to a balanced budget by 2023.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5334465.1571954428!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/travis-toews-delivers-2019-budget-speech.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
