His roots are in the Hudson Valley.", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Democratic Presidential hopeful Andrew Yang spent some time in Iowa talking about the Freedom Dividend. Des Moines Register\n\nLong before Andrew Yang built a devoted, internet-fueled following that propelled him into the 2020 Democratic debates, his presidential ambitions were the talk of a small brick church with white columns on a historic street in a Hudson Valley college town.\n\nYang had taken to attending Sunday services at the Reformed Church of New Paltz with his young family after purchasing a weekend home less than two miles away in 2015.\n\nEven his pastor was skeptical when Yang started telling people he was eyeing the White House.\n\n\"At first, I thought what everyone else probably thought \u2014 'Ha ha, great joke,'\" Rev. Mark Mast said. \"Then I realized he was very, very serious.\"\n\nNobody is laughing now.\n\nYang, 44, a political newcomer, quickly morphed from a virtual unknown to the last New Yorker standing in the Democratic presidential primary, outlasting Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio in his bid to take on another Empire State resident: President Donald Trump.\n\nBusinessman and 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang speaks at the Polk County Steak Fry on Sept. 21, 2019.

Here are 4 things you need to know\n\nHe qualified for the first five primary debates, including Tuesday's event in Ohio, with the aid of the \"Yang Gang\" \u2014 his formidable, social-media-savvy group of supporters that helped his campaign raise more than $10 million last quarter.\n\nYang \u2014 whose signature policy proposal is the Freedom Dividend, which would provide a universal basic income of $1,000 a month to all citizens \u2014 is often described as a Manhattan entrepreneur.\n\nHis roots, though, are firmly planted throughout the eastern half of New York state, from his early years in suburban Schenectady to his school days in Westchester County, where he honed his taste in music, comic books and video games while attending Somers public schools for a decade.\n\nNow his family shuttles between New York City and New Paltz, Ulster County, where they remain among the 200 or so active members of the church on historic Huguenot Street.\n\n\"When they're here, they're in church,\" Mast said.\n\nDemocratic debate: 5 ways the Trump impeachment inquiry will loom large at Tuesday's Democratic debate\n\nBorn in Schenectady; Son of a GE worker\n\nAndrew Yang's family owned this home in Niskayuna, Schenectady County, before moving to Westchester when he was four. (Photo: Jon Campbell / Albany Bureau)\n\nYang is a first-generation American, born in Schenectady to a pair of Taiwanese immigrants in January 1975.\n\nHis parents, Nancy and Kei-Hsiung Yang, met as graduate students at the University of California, Berkeley, before moving east when his father scored a job as a researcher at General Electric, a pillar of the Schenectady economy since the company was founded there in the late 19th century.\n\nYang's mother worked at Blue Cross Blue Shield, according to his 2018 book,\"The War on Normal People.\"\n\nThey lived in the neighboring suburb of Niskayuna, about 18 miles northwest of Albany, moving from an apartment complex to a modest, two-floor house near the local high school when Andrew was just six months old, according to deed records.\n\nBy 1979, when Yang was four, his father \u2014 whose name is on more than 60 patents, records show \u2014 moved on to a research job with another major company with New York roots: IBM.\n\nThe job change brought Yang's family to the Lower Hudson Valley, where IBM has long maintained a major presence.\n\nAndrew Yang: Andrew Yang plans to sit down with Shane Gillis after the comedian was fired from 'SNL'\n\nYang attended school in Somers\n\nThere, the Yangs bought a home on David Road in the Westchester town of Somers, setting up roots in the county Yang would call home for the next decade-plus.\n\nHis mother got a job as an analyst for the Department of Computer Services at SUNY Purchase, eventually becoming the department director.\n\nIn 1986, deed records show the Yangs moved to Cobbling Rock Drive, where they would live in Andrew's middle and high-school years.\n\n\"To me, it was I think a fairly typical suburban, first generation born in this country (childhood), where I had an older brother and we were very nerdy,\" Yang said in a June interview on the Rubin Report, a YouTube talk show.\n\nYang's campaign declined to make him available for an interview for this story. His older brother, Larry, an NYU professor, also declined to speak, though he noted he \"wholeheartedly support(s)\" his brother's campaign.\n\nDemocratic debate: Why the 2020 election will be decided in suburbs like Westerville, Ohio\n\nThose who knew him at the time described him as a brilliant student who was both athletic and nerdy, with an outsize vocabulary he credited to his love of comic books.\n\nAndy Yang, as he was known then, was a wrestler and tennis player who had an affection for Dungeons & Dragons and arcade games like Street Fighter II.\n\n\"I always tell people that Andy was pretty much the smartest guy I knew,\" said Daniel Miller, a Somers classmate.\n\n\"We always had a little bit of competition in science classes and all that, then we just ended up hanging out and joking about how we were getting our assignments done really fast and goofing off in class.\"\n\nConcerts and arcade games\n\nAndrew Yang, who attended Somers public schools from 1980 to 1990, is shown in the Somers High School 1990 yearbook. (Photo: Courtesy of Somers Central School District)\n\nYang and Miller, now a San Francisco-based video-game designer under the company name danbo.co, formed a close friendship that began in middle school.\n\nThey would take the train to Mount Kisco to feed quarters into the arcade games at the now-defunct Electric Playhouse. They were the \"brains\" of the school, taking honors classes together, Miller said.\n\nThey bonded over discovering new wave and industrial music, traveling to concerts along the way. He and Yang gleefully bought Catherine Wheel t-shirts after seeing the English band open for the Soup Dragons, a Scottish one-hit wonder, in the early 1990s.\n\n\"That's always something that always impressed me about Andy \u2014 if he likes something, he likes it,\" Miller said. \"He doesn't worry if it's cool or not.\"\n\nYang's September debate surprise: Andrew Yang reveals his debate surprise \u2013 $1,000 a month for 10 more families\n\nYang credits Miller for shaping his musical tastes and style, telling Jezebel he distinctly remembers Miller returning from summer break as a full-on goth in eighth grade.\n\n\"Dan had a real impact on my musical taste, and we ended up going to many of these concerts together,\" Yang told the feminist website. \"So I daresay, if I win in 2020, I would be the first ex-goth president.\"\n\nMiller has a slightly different take: \"I would call him more of a skater, new wave kid back then.\"\n\nAn actor and tennis player, too\n\nThis house on Cobbling Rock Road in Katonah used to be the home of presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Oct. 8, 2019. (Photo: Frank Becerra Jr./The Journal News)\n\nYang attended Somers schools from 1980 through 1990, according to the school district.\n\nHis yearbooks suggest he was an active student, serving as a member of the tennis team and the drama club as an underclassman at Somers High School.\n\n\u201cAs a kid, my parents told me that my job was to get into a good college, which involved getting good grades, playing piano at a competitive level, and playing tennis well enough to make my mediocre high school team,\" Yang wrote in his 2014 book, \"Smart People Should Build Things.\"\n\nIn 1990, Yang picked up a speaking role in the Somers High School annual drama club production, playing a professor in Thornton Wilder's famed 1938 play \"Our Town.\"\n\nThe role required him to deliver a lengthy monologue, a rarity for an underclassman, according to Tony DiFabbio, the now-retired English teacher who directed the play.\n\n\"He did a spectacular monologue,\" DiFabbio said. \"He stood out in auditions. He was wonderful, and I was so glad he took the role.\"\n\nDiFabbio, who also taught Yang's ninth grade honors English class, remembers Yang being deeply involved in class discussions about classic literature like Shakespeare plays and Homer's \"Odyssey.\"\n\n\"He was quite affable and very bright and interested in being part of things,\" he said. \"I wouldn't call him a class clown \u2014 that's not the right way to describe him \u2014 but I would say he was spirited and effervescent in class.\"\n\nYang: 'I'm Asian, so I know a lot of doctors'\n\nRacist taunts, finishing school elsewhere\n\nHis experience at Somers was not universally positive.\n\nIn his 2018 book, Yang recalled some of the racist taunts he would endure from students who would pick on his Asian heritage.\n\nMost of the name-calling came in middle school, he wrote. It made him self-conscious and angry, but helped shape his personality.\n\n\u201cPerhaps as a result, I\u2019ve always taken pride in relating to the underdog or little guy or gal,\" he wrote.\n\n\"As I grew up, I tried to stick up for whoever seemed excluded or marginalized. I became a Mets fan. I\u2019d go to a party and find the person who seemed the most alone or uncomfortable and strike up a conversation.\"\n\nAndrew Yang's sophomore year photo in the 1990 Somers High School yearbook. (Photo: Courtesy of Somers Central School District)\n\nYang did not finish out his high school career at Somers.\n\nAfter his sophomore year, he transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy, a highly touted boarding school in New Hampshire. It was an idea Yang came up with when talking with friends he made at a summer program for gifted students \u2014 \"nerd camp,\" as he put it \u2014 at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\n\n\u201cI pitched going there to my parents,\" Yang wrote in his 2014 book. \"I was kind of coasting at my public school, halfheartedly doing well enough to maintain my general profile as the smart kid but not really pushing too hard.\u201d\n\nYang finished high school at Exeter, landing a spot on the U.S. national debate team along the way.\n\nLater he would go to Brown University on a partial scholarship funded by IBM. His parents mortgaged their home to help pay for it, he wrote in his 2014 book.\n\nWestchester County mortgage records seem to back that up: His parents took out a $31,000 mortgage on their home in August 1992, when Yang left for college.\n\nTom Steyer: He has been pushing impeachment for years. Now it's center stage for his first debate\n\nReturn to the Hudson Valley\n\nSupporters of Democratic presidential candidate, entrepreneur Andrew Yang listen to Yang speak at a campaign rally on September 30, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. Yang is the son of Taiwanese immigrants and was born in upstate New York. (Photo: Mario Tama, Getty Images)\n\nYang's post-college life has been a major part of his campaign message.\n\nHe moved to Manhattan and earned a degree from Columbia Law School. But he quickly gave up on a career as a lawyer after just a few months working for a high-powered firm, Davis Polk & Wardwell.\n\nHe eventually became the CEO of Manhattan Prep, a company that offered prep courses for the GMAT and other tests, for more than 10 years.\n\nFrom there, he launched Venture for America, a training and fellowship program for young entrepreneurs, stepping down as he ramped up his presidential campaign.\n\nIn 2015, he made a return to the Hudson Valley, purchasing a 4-bedroom, 3-bath home in the town of New Paltz.\n\nThe Yangs \u2014 Andrew; his wife, Evelyn; and their two young children \u2014 spend most weekends in the fall and winter there, though Yang himself has been there less frequently since launching his campaign in 2017, according to Mast, the Reformed Church of New Paltz pastor.\n\nTulsi Gabbard: Tulsi Gabbard says she will attend Tuesday Dem debate after considering a protest\n\nDan Torres, a New Paltz town councilman, said his grandmother \u2014 a member of the Reformed Church, a progressive-leaning Christian church \u2014 told him more than a year ago she goes to church with a presidential candidate.\n\nTorres wasn't buying it.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh God. OK, grandma,'\" he said. \"It wasn't until much later that I realized she was actually correct.\"\n\nThe New Paltz home serves as the Yangs' getaway from their Manhattan apartment, which remains their primary residence and where Yang remains registered to vote.\n\n\"When they moved here, we treated them like any other people who were coming,\" Mast said.\n\nFrom there, Mast and Yang would meet occasionally for coffee and talk after Sunday services. Mast, who called Yang \"brilliant,\" has been a supporter of Yang's campaign, penning a faith-based message in support of universal basic income for Yang's website.\n\nYang's campaign, meanwhile, maintains an enthusiastic following in the Hudson Valley and Ulster County in particular.\n\nDedicated Hudson Valley support\n\nKeiko Sono, an artist and a lead organizer of the Hudson Valley Yang Gang, said Yang's push for a universal basic income has endeared him to many of the professional artists and creative types who have long flocked to Woodstock, New Paltz and nearby areas.\n\nA supporter since he first launched his campaign in 2017, Sono said she's been heartened to see Yang's campaign continuing to gain public support.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll last week showed he had support of 3% of Democrats nationally, trailing only Sen. Elizabeth Warren (29%), Vice President Joe Biden (26%) and Pete Buttigieg (4%), mayor of South Bend, Indiana, in the crowded Democratic field.\n\n\"We're so thankful he is running for president to push the idea of (universal basic income),\" Sono said. \"I have to say, at first nobody really thought he would go anywhere. But we understood he was doing this to spread the idea.\"\n\nThose who knew Yang as a young man have enjoyed seeing his national profile rise.\n\nMiller is a big supporter, with a huge Yang 2020 sign outside the window of his San Francisco home. He's been attending Yang's California rallies and events for two years, watching them grow from small gatherings of 20 people to large rallies attended by thousands.\n\nHe was amused when he saw a recent viral video of Yang crowd surfing at a campaign event, thinking back to their crowd-surfing days at concerts in their youth.\n\n\"That's the thing that is so exciting to me about supporting him,\" Miller said.\n\n\"How often do you get to support someone that you genuinely know is a caring, empathetic person of integrity? And you know this because you know him well and you've known him for many, many years.\"\n\nContact Jon Campbell at JCAMPBELL1@gannett.com\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/15/andrew-yang-raised-in-new-york-hudson-valley/3984118002/", "description": "Andrew Yang, the presidential candidate, is often described as a Manhattan entrepreneur, but his roots are spread throughout New York state.", "authors": ["Jon Campbell", "Published A.M.
