Luciano Passirani, an Italian football journalist, was a guest on the Qui Studio a Voi Stadio show when he made the racist remark and the director of the Telelombardia show reacted immediately by saying that he would never appear on the programme again.\n\nThe show was debating Lukaku\u2019s impact for Inter so far since joining Manchester United in the summer and Passirani said: \u201cLukaku is one of the best signings that Inter could have made. I don\u2019t see another player like him on any other team in Italy. He is one of the strongest, I like him a lot because he has that strength: he is the twin of [D\u00favan] Zapata at Atalanta.\u201d\n\nInter\u2019s Romelu Lukaku is the latest victim of ultras\u2019 warped loyalty | Nicky Bandini Read more\n\nHe then added: \u201cThey have something extra that the rest don\u2019t have, and then they score the goals and drag your team forward. This guy kills you in the one-on-ones, if you try to challenge him you wind up on the floor. Either you have 10 bananas to eat, that you give to him, or \u2026\u201d\n\nThe director of the show, Fabio Ravezzani, said that Passirani had apologised but that that was not enough. \u201cMr Passirani is 80 years old and to compliment Lukaku he used a metaphor that turned out to be racist,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it was a terrible lack of momentary lucidity. I cannot tolerate any kind of errors, even if momentary.\u201d\n\nOn the pitch Lukaku has been a huge success already, scoring two goals in three games as Inter sit top of Serie A. But it has been a troubled time off the pitch after he was subjected to monkey chants by Cagliari fans. To make matters worse, Inter fans then wrote an open letter supporting the Cagliari fans.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand that Italy is not like many other north European countries where racism is a REAL problem,\u201d said the statement, published on Facebook by a group who occupy the second tier of the Curva Nord at Inter\u2019s San Siro home. \u201cIn Italy we use some \u2018ways\u2019 only to \u2018help our teams\u2019 and to try to make our opponents nervous, not for racism but to mess them up.\u201d\n\nLukaku posted a message on Instagram after the incident in Cagliari, saying: \u201cMany players in the last month have suffered from racial abuse ... I did yesterday too. Football is a game to be enjoyed by everyone and we shouldn\u2019t accept any form of discrimination that will put our game in shame. I hope the football federations all over the world react strongly on all cases of discrimination!\u201d", "description": "An Italian TV commentator has been suspended for saying that the only way to stop Romelu Lukaku is for defenders to say \u2018here are 10 bananas that you can eat\u2019", "authors": ["Marcus Christenson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bae925a46bee630637b5f52e139ecf824bf1e23e/0_42_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e932707c71df805c7ee5786b1cfd7c0d", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
