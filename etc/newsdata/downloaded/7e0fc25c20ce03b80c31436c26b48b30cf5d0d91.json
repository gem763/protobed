The advanced wastewater treatment system onboard purifies used wastewater to near tap-water quality. The system meets the so-called \u2018Baltic Standard\u2019 and treats the wastewater to a higher standard than most waste standards in cities around the world.\n\nPICS: Namibia just inaugurated a R4.2bn port terminal so it can become a new cruise gateway for Southern Africa\n\nThe ship will also be able to plug into a local power grid when it's docked, giving juice to certain systems which will reduce overall emissions.\n\nTo celebrate its brand new look, MSC Magnifica will be embarking on new itineraries starting from Southampton, UK, in mid-2021 through Northern Europe, the Baltic capitals, Canary Islands, Madeira and the Mediterranean. Ticket sales are already open.\n\nCHECK OUT: Start 2020 off right with these carefree cruise destinations\n\nCompiled by Gabi Zietsman\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
