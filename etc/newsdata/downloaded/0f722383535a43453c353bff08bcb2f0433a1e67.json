And the way that balances out is going to be very individual to the person, to the partnership, to the circumstance. But we do want to put effort into more than just [our romantic] relationships.\"\n\nSherman said currently, none of the housemates are thinking of having kids and starting a nuclear family of their own. But, she says, if and when that day comes, the household would decide, collectively, if and how it could accommodate that kind of addition.\n\nAs it is, Clarens Commons is a busy place.\n\nThe house is the hub of a wider community of friends and family members who regularly stop by to hang out.\n\nThe residents throw parties and social events; they screen movies in their basement home cinema.\n\nBut despite the upsides, communal living isn't always easy.\n\n\"If you ask anybody who's in any kind of relationship \u2014 a marriage, or employer-employee, or even your best friend \u2014 there are always things that are going to come up as challenges,\" said Sabrina Bowman, one of the residents.\n\nBowman said the period when they first renovated the house after moving in was a trying time that tested their ability to sort out collective differences.\n\nShe said there was a string of a half-dozen meetings in which someone cried at least once.\n\nAnd that she, herself, was at odds with her housemates over a decision about where to locate one of the bathrooms.\n\nAs is the nature of human interactions, Bowman said, tensions can sometimes run high over seemingly banal issues, but they had their consensus process and their goodwill to fall back on.\n\n\"All that process created this really incredible trust and faith in our ability to, kind of, face anything. You know I think that we were more prepared for this house than most people are for a marriage \u2026 I mean the paperwork alone, but also just the amount of discussions we had ... very very open discussions.\"", "description": "Six friends pooled their resources and bought a house together.
