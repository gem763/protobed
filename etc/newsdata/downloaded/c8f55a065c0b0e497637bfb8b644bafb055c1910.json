Ripken on Wednesday sided with prosecutors during a pretrial hearing, saying the value of the footage outweighs concerns of prejudice because it helps prove the elements of the crimes charged.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe best evidence in this case of what was occurring is the video itself,\u201d Ripken said.\n\nThe judge said redacting the video would \u201ccause confusion of the issues\u201d and be \u201cpotentially misleading to the jury.\u201d\n\nRamos, 39, is charged with murder in the shootings that killed five on June 28, 2018. Ramos has pleaded \u201cnot criminally responsible,\u201d Maryland\u2019s version of the insanity defense.\n\nImages in the video of the shooter, victims fleeing and the murder weapon speak to the deliberate nature of the attack and the fear of those under fire, the judge said. Those elements are needed to prove murder and assault charges.\n\nThe Capital Gazette shooting, one year later: Survivors and loved ones gather to remember the victims\n\nPalan had suggested that still images captured from the video could stand in for the footage, but Anne Arundel County State\u2019s Attorney Anne Colt Leitess pushed back, saying the video shows \u201cdirect evidence of the crime.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo suggest that still pictures could convey the methodical hunting \u2026 is so inaccurate, it\u2019s astounding to me,\u201d Leitess said.\n\nIn arguing to show 36 minutes of video at trial, Leitess said the footage shows Ramos \u201cpacing\u201d and \u201chunting\u201d during the attack. The video also shows Ramos changed his appearance, taking out his ponytail and removing his shooter\u2019s glasses after the shooting, Leitess said. When paired with footage from body-worn cameras, the video reveals he hid under a desk after the attack for upward of 10 minutes as police swept through the office, she said.\n\n\u201cThe hiding shows the consciousness of guilt,\u201d Leitess said.\n\nPolice and prosecutors say Ramos opened fire in the newsroom after a long-standing grudge with the publication. Ramos had lost a defamation suit against the paper after it ran a column about Ramos pleading guilty to harassing a former high school classmate, according to court records.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFive people were killed in the shooting: editorial page editor Gerald Fisch\u00adman, 61; assistant editor Rob Hiaasen, 59; sportswriter, reporter and editor John McNamara, 56; sales assistant Rebecca Smith, 34; and reporter Wendi Winters, 65.\n\nJury selection in the case is scheduled to start Oct. 30.\n\nInnocent man spent months in jail for bringing honey back to United States\n\nProsecutors in Prince George\u2019s will no longer recommend cash bail for defendants\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t you think the defendant is handsome?\u2019: Rape case takes unusual turn when accused represents himself at trial\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Defense attorneys for Jarrod Ramos sought to block the footage from trial saying it would unfairly appeal to the jury\u2019s emotions.", "authors": ["Lynh Bui", "Reporter Focusing On Public Safety", "Criminal Justice"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IWWgw1chMkrcEFcHEGo6RzxF3Y0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FYCRPSVIQQI6TEQUERXFSTPF2U.jpg"}
