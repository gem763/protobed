'I said it, I said it, da s***. Finally. He's a piece of s***.'\n\n'He's lying, lying, lying, lying, and raising money off the death of four Americans,' Vietor, who was a former Obama spokesman, added in the exchange.\n\nFormer National Security Adviser, Susan Rice, can be seen calling Senator Lindsey Graham a 'piece of sh**' during a preview for 'Pod Save the World' which is released, in full, on Wednesday\n\nThe 2012 coordinated attack by the Islamic Ansar al-Sharia militia on United States government facilities in Benghazi, Libya, killed four American citizens, including the US Ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens.\n\nIn the weeks immediately after the attack, Republicans, often led by Lindsey Graham, accused Rice, who was US Ambassador to the UN at the time, of 'misleading the public' with her representation of the situation.\n\nRice had claimed that the jihadist military action was not premeditated and told the public that the attack had evolved from a protest.\n\nThis was all later found to be false.\n\nDespite this, 10 separate investigations into the events concluded that no one in the Obama administration deliberately misled the public.\n\nSusan Rice, pictured, criticised Trump's actions in evacuating US troops from Syria and leaving the Kurds who 'we promised our partnership' and that we would 'stand with them.' Lindsey Graham, pictured left, was a vocal voice among Republicans criticizing Rice for what they said was misleading the public over the events in Benghazi in 2012\n\nRice was National Security Adviser under the Obama administration in 2013\n\nRice, who then became National Security Adviser under the Obama administration in 2013, called US President Trump's decision to pull out of Syria 'bats-crazy.'\n\nRice put her hat down firmly on the side of the Kurds in Syria, saying that they fought 'on our behalf,' during the Late Show.\n\nShe also called Turkey the 'hungry wolf who's trying to kill the lamb.'\n\n'It's just appalling because we promised them out partnership and we promised them that if they worked with us to defeat our common enemy ... then we would stand with them,' she added.\n\n'Trump woke up on the wrong side of the bed, it appears, and decided, 'Never mind.'\n\nTrump has also been less than polite in his response to Rice. In a tweet last week, he spoke of Obama's 'Red Line in the Sand,' the promise of American military intervention in Syria if Assad deployed chemical weapons.\n\n'Susan Rice, who was a disaster to President Obama as National Security Advisor, is now telling us her opinion on what to do in Syria. Remember RED LINE IN THE SAND? That was Obama. Millions killed! No thanks Susan, you were a disaster.'", "description": "Former National Security Adviser Susan Rice called Senator Lindsey Graham a piece of s*** during the recording of a podcast episode as she and the panel discussed the 2012 Benghazi controversy.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/12/20079810-0-image-a-15_1571828408410.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
