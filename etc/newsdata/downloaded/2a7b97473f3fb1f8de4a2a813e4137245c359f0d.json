The women included Sophia Williams-De Bruyn, who in 1956 led 20,000 women in an anti-apartheid march on the seat of government in Pretoria when she was only 18 years old.\n\n\"I was recently reminded that the first one up the mountain often gets knocked down the hardest but makes way for everyone behind them,\" a statement quoted Meghan as saying to the women, adding that all young female campaigners must keep at it.\n\nGender-based violence, she said, was a global problem and the solution had to come from everybody, regardless of factors such as race, gender or politics.\n\nOn Monday Harry will fly to Liwonde National Park in Malawi, where he will join an anti-poaching patrol with local park rangers and witness an anti-poaching demonstration conducted by local rangers and the UK military.\n\nThe next day he will visit a health centre, pharmacy and youth reproductive health outreach programme before rejoining his family in South Africa for another township visit, this time in Johannesburg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Emma Rumney; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise/David Goodman/Jane Merriman)", "description": "Britain's Prince Harry began his first official visit to Malawi on Sunday, with wife Meghan joining him on a college visit via video call after she had met a group of female activists in Cape Town the previous day.
