We have to make money. We have to make a living.\"\n\nThe report notes that successful essay writers in Kenya can earn as much as $2,000 a month, which is about $300 more than the national per capita annual income. However, Mbugua told the Times she \"always had somehow a guilty conscience\" and questions the quality of education that incorporates the essays.\n\n\"People say the education system in the US, UK, and other countries is on a top notch,\" she said but added that she \"wouldn't say those students are better than us,\" because \"we have studied. We have done the assignments.\"\n\nContract cheating from essay mills is a growing global phenomenon\n\nContract cheating has seen a global rise in recent years, and research has suggested that as many as one in six students, or an estimated 31 million, has engaged in the practice.\n\nBusiness Insider's Hayley Peterson previously reported that the network of companies peddling completed school work has a potentially far greater reach than the recent US college-admissions scandal.\n\nThe companies that provide work for purchase are widely referred to as \"essay mills.\" They claim to offer original, \"plagiarism-free\" essays, term papers, dissertations, speeches, and other assignments for payments of as little as $13 per page.\n\nRead more: Millions of students are buying 'plagiarism-free' essays for as little as $13 \u2014 and it's nearly impossible for teachers to prove\n\nLawmakers in the US and globally have recently started cracking down on contract-cheating services as their usage has proliferated. Though the practice is technically illegal in 17 states, cheating is hard to detect and the law rarely enforced.\n\nSimilar legislation has been floated in New Zealand, Australia, and Ireland, but it's unclear how effective the laws can be.\n\nRead more:\n\nMost kids today dream of influencer fame, but YouTubers are warning their young fans about anxiety, exploitation, and burnout\n\nAn 18-year-old had surgery to remove blisters on his lungs after vaping, and his doctor says this could be just the beginning\n\nThe call for a boycott against SoulCycle appears to be working despite the tactic's unpredictable record", "description": "The essay-for-hire industry produces millions of essays made-to-order for college students and \"contract cheating\" is a rising phenomenon.", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d73fcf6f4fc246bfc01c4a7-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
