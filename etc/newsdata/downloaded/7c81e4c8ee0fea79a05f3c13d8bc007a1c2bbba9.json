But there is light and there is always hope. Progressive values are being fought for in Europe.\n\n'Young people are taking a stand for their future. And for Scotland, the hope lies in becoming an independent nation.\n\n'Be in no doubt about this. We are winning the case for independence.'\n\nShe added: 'We won\u2019t take it anymore. We shouldn\u2019t take it anymore. It is time to take charge of our own future. It is time for independence.'\n\nMs Sturgeon claimed the SNP would secure Scottish independence by 'inspiring and persuading' people rather than through the 'Brexit way' of 'undermining democracy' and 'demonising those who disagree'.\n\nAttacking Mr Johnson's Brexit plan, Ms Sturgeon said that any form of leaving the EU would be a 'disaster' as she accused the PM of caring 'nothing for the human consequences of his disastrous' divorce policy.\n\n'We don\u2019t yet know whether the UK will leave with a deal or without,' she said.\n\n'But we do know that neither of these outcomes is in Scotland\u2019s interests. A no deal Brexit is unthinkable.\n\n'And for the Scottish Tories in particular to back such an outcome is simply unforgivable.'\n\nShe also claimed Brexit had illustrated the 'Westminster system is... broken utterly beyond repair' because Scotland voted to Remain but is now on course to be taken out of the EU against its will.\n\nMs Sturgeon said that illustrated why Scotland should be allowed to vote again on whether or not to become an independent nation.\n\n'We have a cast iron mandate for an independence referendum,' she said.\n\n'That fact is beyond doubt. But we don\u2019t just have a right to offer the people of Scotland a choice over their future.\n\n'In the circumstances now Scotland faces, we have a duty to do so. And it is what we intend to do.'\n\nMs Sturgeon said another referendum on independence 'must happen next year' as she outlined her plan to try to force the UK government to give her permission to hold another vote.\n\nMs Sturgeon claimed the SNP had a 'cast iron mandate' for a second independence referendum because of Brexit\n\n'I can confirm today that before the end of this year, I will demand the transfer of power that puts the legality of a referendum beyond any doubt,' she said.\n\n'And when I do, the question should not be to the SNP \u2013 what will we do if Westminster refuses? The question should be demanded of the Westminster parties \u2013 what gives you any right to deny people in Scotland our ability to choose our own future?'\n\nShe said that any refusal in Westminster to hold a second vote would not be 'sustainable' and that when Scotland is asked the independence question again it 'will choose independence'.\n\nMs Sturgeon also moved to try to dismiss arguments against Scottish independence as she insisted the country could prosper if it goes it alone.\n\n'Scotland\u2019s national income is higher per head than countries like France, Japan and New Zealand,' she said.\n\n'So do not ever let anyone tell you that Scotland is not rich enough to be independent, because we most certainly are.'\n\nShe concluded her speech by telling the SNP faithful: 'The world is waiting for us. Let\u2019s win our nation\u2019s independence.'", "description": "Nicola Sturgeon today issued a fresh rallying cry for Scottish independence as she claimed the SNP is 'winning the case' for a split from the rest of the UK.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/16/19747148-0-image-a-95_1571151926796.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
