Trump\u2019s allies in the Senate are trying to focus public attention anywhere but on Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nAnd without a centralized strategy from the White House, House Republicans are taking their cues from Trump, who is treating Schiff as a punching bag in the impeachment fight.\n\nTrump and the GOP are targeting Schiff\u2019s mid-hearing exaggerated rendition of Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine to make it sound like a mob boss shakedown and invoking a New York Times report that the whistleblower sought guidance from an Intelligence Committee aide, which Republicans have used to allege without evidence that Schiff helped write the complaint.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
