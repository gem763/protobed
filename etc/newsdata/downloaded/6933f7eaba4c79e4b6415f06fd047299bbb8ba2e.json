It includes public hearings, a written report on the findings and gives Republicans limited power to call witnesses.\n\nLacking from the eight-page document is a timeline for when the process will move to each step and when it expects to be concluded.\n\nUnder the resolution, power is concentrated in the hands of House Intelligence committee Chair Adam Schiff, who can authorize longer periods to question witnesses and who can approve Republican requests for witnesses to appear.\n\nThe Intelligence panel will take the lead in the next, immediate steps. Those include public hearings where Republican lawmakers and staff can question witnesses.\n\nBut there is no role for the president's lawyer in the that stage - which is the White House's chief complaint.\n\nAfter its public hearings conclude, the Intelligence panel will submit its findings to the House Judiciary Committee, which will have the responsibility for drafting any articles of impeachment that would charge the president.\n\nSTEPHANIE GRISHAM STATEMENT ON RESOLUTION The resolution put forward by Speaker Pelosi confirms that House Democrats\u2019 impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start as it lacked any proper authorization by a House vote. It continues this scam by allowing Chairman Schiff, who repeatedly lies to the American people, to hold a new round of hearings, still without any due process for the President. The White House is barred from participating at all, until after Chairman Schiff conducts two rounds of one-sided hearings to generate a biased report for the Judiciary Committee. Even then, the White House's rights remain undefined, unclear, and uncertain \u2013 because those rules still haven\u2019t been written. This resolution does nothing to change the fundamental fact that House Democrats refuse to provide basic due process rights to the Administration.\n\nIt's in that stage that President Trump's lawyers will get to be involved but what rights they will have - such as the ability to question witnesses - are not outlined in the resolution.\n\n'The White House is barred from participating at all, until after Chairman Schiff conducts two rounds of one-sided hearings to generate a biased report for the Judiciary Committee. Even then, the White House's rights remain undefined, unclear, and uncertain \u2013 because those rules still haven\u2019t been written,' Grisham argued in her statement on the resolution.\n\nBy the time the president gets to participate, most of the drama will have played out on television screens across the country.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have called foul on the restrictions Democrats have placed on them when it comes to presenting Trump's case when the hearings move the public stage.\n\nRep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the intelligence panel, can request witnesses, documents and any subpoenas the GOP want but Schiff must sign off on those requests and the full committee, which has a majority of Democrats, must approve them by vote.\n\nDemocrats point out that it is the same practice Republicans used for the minority power during the impeachment proceedings into President Bill Clinton into 1998.\n\nThe resolution puts the power in the impeachment inquiry into House Intelligence panel Chair Adam Schiff\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi will lead Democrats in voting on the resolution on Thursday\n\nThe resolution is slated for a vote on Thursday in the full House. Republican leadership is telling its members to vote no on what they call a 'Soviet-style' resolution.\n\nUnder the Democratic-written measure, the House committees are directed 'to continue their ongoing investigations as part of the existing House of Representatives inquiry into whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its Constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump, President of the United States of America, and for other purposes.'\n\nBesides setting out the procedure for public hearings, the House intelligence panel is directed to write a public report - with classified information redacted - and ultimately transfer its findings to the House Judiciary Committee, which will take the lead in the final stage of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThat panel, led by Chairman Jerry Nadler, will draw up any articles of impeachment that will end up before the full House for a vote.\n\nThe Judiciary panel can also hold public hearings as it works on drafting the articles.\n\nFor both committees, in the public hearings, each side could engage in extended questioning of witnesses in rounds of up to 90 minutes before beginning the traditional five-minute rounds extended to lawmakers on those panels under existing rules.\n\nBoth lawmakers and staff would have the ability to ask questions.\n\nThe resolution also allows for Trump to make his case before lawmakers in the Judiciary Committee stage.\n\n'The House authorizes the Committee on the Judiciary to conduct proceedings relating to the impeachment inquiry referenced in the first section of this resolution pursuant to the procedures submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the chair of the Committee on Rules, including such procedures as to allow for the participation of the President and his counsel,' it reads.\n\nA fact sheet put out by Democrats says that the president's lawyers can will have an opportunity to present their case, attend hearings, respond to evidence, and raise an objection to testimony given.\n\nBut the actual rules for Trump's role will be worked out at a later date.\n\nPresident Trump and Republicans have cried foul on impeachment process\n\nRepublicans and President Trump have assailed the impeachment process.\n\nBy offering a resolution on the next steps, Democrats could undercut that argument if Republicans bring it up during the public hearings.\n\nAdditionally, by putting the Intelligence and Judiciary panels in charge of the next steps, it would appear to cut out the House Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees, which have played a role in the closed-door hearings.\n\nThat result could see some of Trump's most ardent defenders - Republican lawmakers Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows among them - not part of the panels that will question witnesses in the public hearings, which are sure to play out on the 24-hour cable news channels.\n\nGOP lawmakers immediately attacked the resolution for giving Schiff approval over the witnesses they want to call.\n\n'Socialist Dem impeachment resolution lets Repubs call witnesses ... IF Adam Schiff okays. Duh! Will Adam Schiff allow exculpatory witnesses that embarrass Socialist Dems and help public discern truth? Schiff past partisan dishonesty suggests UNLIKELY!,' Republican Congressman Mo Brooks tweeted.\n\nBut Democrats argued the resolution outlines the path forward.\n\n'The House impeachment inquiry has collected extensive evidence and testimony, and soon the American people will hear from witnesses in an open setting. The resolution introduced today in the House Rules Committee will provide that pathway forward,' Schiff and his fellow committee chairs Eliot Engel, Carolyn Maloney and Jerry Nadler said in a statement.\n\n'The resolution provides rules for the format of open hearings in the House Intelligence Committee, including staff-led questioning of witnesses, and it authorizes the public release of deposition transcripts.\n\n'The resolution also establishes procedures for the transfer of evidence to the Judiciary Committee as it considers potential articles of impeachment, and it sets forth due process rights for the President and his Counsel in the Judiciary Committee proceedings,' they said.", "description": "The White House blasted the Democrats' resolution that outlines the next steps in the impeachment inquiry as 'an illegitimate sham' that lacks 'any due process' for Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/20/20344028-0-image-a-15_1572379203634.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
