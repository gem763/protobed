The term can be represented by stroking over the chin \u2013 an action used in British sign language \u2013 or by displaying pipe curls with the fingers or gesturing with the finger over the nose.\n\nThe dictionary has been recently updated to indicate that the latter two signs have negative connotations but the University of Ghent, which hosts the Flemish sign language centre on its website, is facing calls for the signs\u2019 removal.\n\nMenachem Margolin of the European Jewish Association said: \u201cThe one with the hair strands is acceptable, although misleading. The videos using a gesture of a big and crocheted nose to define a Jew are just racist and humiliating for Jews.\u201d\n\nLisa Rombouts, from the Flemish Sign Language Centre, said a new edition of the dictionary would be published that would \u201cclarify these matters\u201d.\n\nShe told De Morgen newspaper: \u201cThe gesture in question is probably the oldest variant of that gesture in the dictionary. The video has been on our site for 15 years. We don\u2019t want to delete that, because a dictionary describes the current situation.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it has not been possible to completely renew the dictionary in recent years because we only received subsidies for that last year.\u201d\n\nLast month, the sign language dictionary in New Zealand came under criticism for a series of portrayals of minority communities.\n\nAlong with the hook-nose gesture for the word Jew, one of the words for representing Chinese people involves tugging at the corner of the eye. Gay is represented by a hand-flop and Samoan by pressing down on your nose.\n\nSuch representations were removed from signed television in the UK in 2004, a year after British sign language was adopted as one of the country\u2019s indigenous languages.", "description": "Calls for \u2018racist and humiliating\u2019 gesture to be removed from online guide to Flemish signing", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c66d6989c0ad3c981fc1c47f5ec3815c0f09fa37/160_33_2044_1226/master/2044.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=16614602c97bc0491a078d5a7a72ea98", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
