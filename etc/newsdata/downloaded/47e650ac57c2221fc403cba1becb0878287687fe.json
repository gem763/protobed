All 189 passengers and crew died when the almost-new Boeing 737 Max plunged into the Java Sea at 415mph.\n\nThe accident happened after a faulty sensor triggered an anti-stall system known as MCAS. The software forced the nose of the aircraft down despite the efforts of the pilots to override it.\n\nIn March 2019, an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max suffered a similar fate, in a crash that claimed 157 lives.\n\nShortly afterwards the Max was grounded worldwide. The aircraft remains out of service.\n\nBoeing expects the 737 Max to be airborne again before the end of the year.\n\nBut Senator Tester said he would never fly on the plane, repeating: \u201cI would walk. You shouldn\u2019t be cutting corners.\u201d\n\nMr Muilenburg did not respond directly \u2013 a pattern that he followed for much of the two-hour session.\n\nMany relatives of the victims of the crashes were sitting behind the Boeing boss.\n\nHe began the session by saying to them: \u201cI wanted to let you know, on behalf of myself and all of the men and women of Boeing, how deeply sorry I am.\n\n\u201cAs we observe today the solemn anniversary of the loss of Lion Air flight 610, please know that we carry the memory of these accidents, and of your loved ones, with us every day.\n\n\u201cThey will never be forgotten, and these tragedies will continue to drive us to do everything we can to make our airplanes and our industry safer.\u201d\n\nAfter his opening statement, Mr Muilenburg faced a barrage of criticism.\n\nTammy Duckworth, a former Army helicopter pilot and now Democrat senator for Illinois, said: \u201cPilots know that catastrophes don\u2019t happen in a vacuum.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell the pilots that MCAS was in there. Then you added an extra step that would trigger it again five seconds later.\n\n\u201cTime and again, Boeing has not told the whole truth. And these families are suffering because of this.\u201d\n\nThe planemaker was also accused of \u201cactively lobbying the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] to keep planes in the air\u201d after the second Boeing 737 Max aircraft.\n\nSenator Jacky Rosen, a Democrat from Nevada, criticised the fact that the Boeing 737 is \u201cstill working off the same certification as 1967\u201d, the year when the original twin-jet first flew.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost as though you took a canoe and turned it into a cruise ship.\u201d\n\nMr Muilenburg said earlier: \u201cWe know we made mistakes and got some things wrong. We own that, and we are fixing them.\n\n\u201cAs painful as it can be, the process of learning from failure, and even from tragedies like these, has been essential to the advances in airplane safety since the industry began.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the session, the chairman, Roger Wicker (Mississippi, Republican), said: \u201cThis has been one of the most difficult hearings I have ever participated in.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nBlack Friday 2019: Our pick of Argos, John Lewis and Currys\u2019 deals\n\nBoeing 737 Max: When will the doomed jet fly again?\n\nBoeing condemned in Lion Air 737 Max accident report\n\nBoeing predicts 737 Max will fly again by the end of 2019\n\nBoeing replaces senior executive in charge of 737 Max\n\nBoeing pilots feared for 737 Max safety three years ago", "description": "A senior US politician has told the boss of Boeing: \u201cI would walk before I would get on a 737 Max.\u201dSenator Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana, was speaking at a marathon session of the Senate Commerce Committee in Washington DC.", "authors": ["Simon Calder"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.NJitCFRc.nZ_bGbFs25oA--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/19f963d9303a146cbdb10eef8fac0c84", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
