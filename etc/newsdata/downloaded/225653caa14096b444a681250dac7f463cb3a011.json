We have a whole program that you have to go through.' \"\n\nThe program included psychological exams and evaluations.\n\n\"And I thought, 'I'm not really here for a shrink, I just want a plumber.' \"\n\nElizabeth did complete the program, and in 1972, successfully underwent the surgery.\n\n\"Later on, my mother sat the kids down and told them the truth \u2014 the big secret,\" Elizabeth told Jennifer.\n\nAfter her siblings learned about their sister, Elizabeth got an unexpected knock on her door.\n\nHer little brother, Billy, about 11 years old then, was standing in the doorway.\n\n\"He just looked up at me and said, 'Hi, it's me.' \"\n\nA tearful Elizabeth hugged her smiling brother. \"Was he ashamed of me?\" she thought. No, she said, \"he wanted me back.\"\n\n\"When I opened that door, all I can say is it was like my heart was exploding, and I was going to have family again,\" she recalled.\n\nHer brother's visit was a big step for her family, she said, who now recognize her as a woman.\n\n\"It made me feel wanted, and it made me feel loved. That meant more to me than anything had meant in a long time,\" she said.\n\nToday, Elizabeth lives in downtown Philadelphia in an LGBT-friendly building for seniors, where she's surrounded by people who accept her, too.\n\nAudio produced for Morning Edition by Jud Esty-Kendall and Afi Yellow-Duke.\n\nStoryCorps is a national nonprofit that gives people the chance to interview friends and loved ones about their lives.
