(AP) - Mississippi was the Southeastern Conference\u2019s big surprise last year. Now the Rebels aim to live up to heightened expectations with a reshaped roster, veteran backcourt and improved depth.\n\n\u201cI like where our team is,\u201d Ole Miss coach Kermit Davis said. \u201cCompared to last year\u2019s team, I was very proud of that team, we\u2019re deeper more athletic. We look more like an SEC team.\u201d\n\nDavis wants Ole Miss to take another step forward after the Rebels went 20-13 and reached the NCAA Tournament in his debut season. That 2018-19 team tied for sixth place in the SEC after being picked to finish last in the league.\n\nThis year, the SEC\u2019s preseason media poll has Ole Miss finishing eighth out of 14 teams.\n\nThe biggest loss the program suffered is the production of Terence Davis, who averaged 15.6 points per game and led the team in both rebounds and assists. Davis signed a two-year deal with the Toronto Raptors.\n\nNow that Davis has departed, the bulk of the scoring load will be shouldered by a backcourt combination of senior Breein Tyree and junior Devontae Shuler.\n\nTyree averaged 17.9 points last season to rank third in the SEC. He earned second-team Associated Press all-SEC honors and was a first-team all-SEC selection of the league\u2019s coaches.\n\n\u201cI am not really focused on scoring too many points or going for 30 a game,\u201d Tyree said. \u201cWhether it is scoring 10 or 30, I am going to do what we need to do to win.\u201d\n\nShuler, who made the move from wing to point guard last year, was perhaps the most invaluable cog on the roster because of the position shift and his on-ball defending prowess. He averaged 10.3 points per game and tallied 56 steals. Tyree\u2019s bump in scoring can be in part attributed to Shuler taking over at point guard, allowing Tyree to play more off the ball.\n\nOle Miss will likely be a guard-oriented team again this season. The Rebels hope they are deeper and better equipped in the post, a weak point last year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve changed as a program from this time last year, our maturity level in the classroom, our maturity level the way we go about our business day-to-day,\u201d Kermit Davis said. \u201cWe\u2019re not close to where we need to be, but I\u2019m proud of the progress.\u201d\n\nSome other things to watch during Mississippi\u2019s 2019-20 season:\n\nNEW-LOOK FRONTCOURT\n\nThe crux of Ole Miss\u2019 roster overhaul resided in the frontcourt.\n\nNew forwards include freshmen Sammy Hunter, Shon Robinson and Antavion Collum along with junior-college transfer Khadim Sy. Robinson is expected to redshirt.\n\nOle Miss also has sophomores Blake Hinson and K.J. Buffen as well as redshirt freshman Carlos Curry. The Rebels should have more options to defend the paint and rebound better than they did last season.\n\nSOPHOMORE LEAPS FOR BUFFEN, HINSON\n\nBuffen and Hinson, who both stand at 6-foot-7 and roughly 225 pounds, played a lot of minutes on a thin team last year. Both added weight this offseason and are expected to contribute more. Buffen improved his jump shot and Hinson has emerged as a leader.\n\nHinson was diagnosed with a blood irregularity in August, but Davis hopes to have him back by the start of the season.\n\nVERSATILE RODRIGUEZ\n\nSophomore Luis Rodriguez is a prime candidate to be the Rebels\u2019 breakout player, according to Davis. Rodriguez played sparingly as a freshman but earned the trust of the coaching staff. At 6-6, 200 pounds, he\u2019s a versatile wing who could provide a rebounding boost.\n\n\u201cIf we started today, he would start,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHe\u2019s physical and when the ball goes up, he\u2019s a natural instinctive rebounder.\u201d\n\nJUNIOR-COLLEGE IMPACT\n\nSy and Bryce Williams are the two junior college newcomers on the roster. Both are expected to make an immediate impact.\n\nSy, a 6-10 power forward, was the centerpiece of the 2019 recruiting class and has a good chance to start immediately. Williams aims to crack the rotation in a veteran backcourt.\n\nSCHEDULE HIGHLIGHTS\n\nOle Miss has a couple of notable non-conference matchups in the first month of the season, including a Nov. 23 game at No. 14 Memphis just before NIT Season Tipoff against Penn State, and potentially Syracuse or Oklahoma State in Brooklyn, New York. The Rebels host Butler on Dec. 23 and visit Wichita State on Jan. 4.\n\nThe Rebels open the season Nov. 8 by hosting Arkansas State.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mississippi was the Southeastern Conference's big surprise last year.
