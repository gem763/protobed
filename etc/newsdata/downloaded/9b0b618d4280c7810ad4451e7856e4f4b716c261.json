Call Donald Trump an \u2018Orange Clown\u2019 for Using Their Music Without Permission", "language": "en", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s taste in music \u2014 while perhaps common for the sexagenarian demographic \u2014 has caused him some woes since he announced his presidential campaign back in June. Searching for a good and catchy theme song to roll out on the campaign trail, the Donald initially declared himself a Neil Young man, using the classic \u201cRockin\u2019 in the Free World\u201d for an early summer rally; the song was promptly reclaimed by Young and given to Bernie Sanders as retaliation. Now R.E.M. have swiftly followed suit. At a rally in Washington, D.C., yesterday, Trump chose \u201cIt\u2019s the End of the World\u201d as his pump-up music while he walked to the podium. The band wasn\u2019t thrilled.\n\nFounding member Mike Mills quickly took to Twitter to vent:\n\nPersonally, I think the Orange Clown will do anything for attention. I hate giving it to him. \u2014 Mike Mills (@m_millsey) September 9, 2015\n\nHowever, things took an angrier turn when lead singer Michael Stipe began tweeting from Mills\u2019s account.\n\nUpcoming is Michael's statement about Trump using our song at the rally. His opinions are HIS, please do not tweet angry responses at me. \u2014 Mike Mills (@m_millsey) September 9, 2015\n\n\"Go fuck yourselves, the lot of you--you sad, attention grabbing, power-hungry little men. Do not use our music or my voice for your 1) \u2014 Mike Mills (@m_millsey) September 9, 2015\n\n...moronic charade of a campaign.\"--Michael Stipe \u2014 Mike Mills (@m_millsey) September 9, 2015\n\nThe band later issued an official statement on their Facebook page:\n\n\u201cWhile we do not authorize or condone the use of our music at this political event, and do ask that these candidates cease and desist from doing so, let us remember that there are things of greater importance at stake here. The media and the American voter should focus on the bigger picture, and not allow grandstanding politicians to distract us from the pressing issues of the day and of the current Presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nSo there goes R.E.M. Mr. Trump, if you ask us (which you totally should), may we suggest asking the Presidents of the United of America (get it!?) to slightly change the words to \u201cLump.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s Trump / He\u2019s Trump / He\u2019s Trump / He\u2019s in my head.\u201d", "description": "R.E.M. won't let him use It's the End of the World on the campaign trail.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/09/10/10-donald-trump-and-michael-stipe.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2015-09-10"}
