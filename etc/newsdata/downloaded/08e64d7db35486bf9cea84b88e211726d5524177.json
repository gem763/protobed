They will discuss how to reach an agreement over a working lunch of snails, salmon and cheese.\n\nTalks are still stalled on the contentious issue of the Irish border backstop, a policy intended to ensure there are no checks on goods crossing the U.K.\u2019s land border with Ireland. On Sunday, two cabinet ministers reiterated Johnson\u2019s desire for a deal, and talked up his chances of achieving that aim.\n\nBarclay told Sky News\u2019s \u201cRidge on Sunday\u201d there is a \u201clanding zone\u201d for an accord, before suggesting in a later radio interview that the transition period after leaving could be extended beyond 2020 to sort out the issues relating to the backstop. Meanwhile Home Secretary Priti Patel said Johnson is fully committed to getting a deal and the machinery of government is focused on such a result.\n\nFlouts Law\n\nStill, Juncker sounded less optimistic on a weekend radio interview as he expressed doubt that the U.K. leader will offer fresh and viable proposals on the Irish impasse. Juncker also said Britain would risk \u201cutter chaos\u201d that will take years to fix if Johnson proceeds with a threat to pull the nation out of the trade bloc without a deal on Oct. 31.\n\nHe may have reasons to worry. Johnson also signaled this weekend that he will ignore a new British law requiring him to ask the EU for Brexit to be postponed and prepare to fight his opponents in court.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s hardened stance dramatically raises the stakes in the U.K.\u2019s political and constitutional crisis over its tortured exit from the EU. After voting to leave the trading bloc in 2016, the country is no closer to completing the divorce in a way that avoids the chaos of a sudden rupture without an agreement to soften the blow.\n\nUnder a law passed by Parliament this month, against Johnson\u2019s wishes, the prime minister must write to the EU to seek an extension if an agreement has not been agreed on by Oct. 19 and Parliament hasn\u2019t given consent to leaving without a deal. Johnson will refuse to write this letter, the senior government official said, and if no agreement is reached with EU leaders at a summit in Brussels on Oct. 17-18, the government will pursue a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cWhat on earth is the point of any further delay?\u201d Johnson said in his column. \u201cLet\u2019s end the wrangling, get this thing done, and set this country on a brighter, more cheerful, more confident and more global path \u2013 and let\u2019s come out of the EU on Oct. 31.\u201d\n\nJohnson will prepare to fight the legal challenge his opponents are likely to mount in court, immediately after the Oct. 19 deadline for seeking a delay, the official said. Opponents of a no-deal split are also likely to offer draft laws in Parliament aimed at canceling Brexit altogether and revoking the official notification that triggered the divorce proceedings, the official said.\n\nThat concern could help unlock support within his Conservative Party, with the Sunday Times reporting that hard-line Brexiteers have signaled they would be willing to vote for a deal if Johnson can win meaningful concessions on the Irish backstop.", "description": "Johnson Talks Up a Brexit Deal as He Heads for Juncker Meeting", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic1fad2b806b35aae82befd429a95eb607.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
