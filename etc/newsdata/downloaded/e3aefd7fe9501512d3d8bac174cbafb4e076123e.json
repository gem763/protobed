The Department of Justice\u2019s briefs comprehensively answer these claims. But I hope to find time to address some of the amicus briefs directly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s start with the amicus brief filed by Laurence Tribe and Joshua Matz on behalf of two former Solicitors General (Theodore B. Olson and Seth Waxman) and two former acting Solicitor Generals (Walter Dellinger and Neal Katyal).*\n\n1. The brief\u2019s core claim that \u201can employer who discriminates based on transgender status necessarily accounts for sex at every single step of his or her reasoning\u201d rests on the assumption that any employment practice that can be applied only by identifying an employee\u2019s sex amounts to discrimination on the basis of sex under Title VII. But that assumption is contradicted by the longstanding acceptance of sex-specific restrooms, sex-specific locker rooms and shower facilities, and dress codes (which all require taking account of an employee\u2019s sex).\n\nAmazingly, the brief does not even acknowledge this contradiction, much less try to explain it away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Relatedly, while the brief undertakes to parse the meaning of the terms \u201cbecause of,\u201d \u201csuch individual\u2019s,\u201d and \u201csex\u201d in Title VII, it never examines what the critical word \u201cdiscriminate\u201d means in conjunction with those other terms. It instead simply assumes, wrongly, that any distinction on the basis of sex amounts to unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex. So much for serious textualist analysis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. The brief wrongly asserts that the Court in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services (1998) \u201cheld that Title VII forbids \u2018male-on-male sexual harassment in the workplace.\u2019\u201d In fact, the Court held only that there is no \u201ccategorical rule excluding same-sex harassment claims from the coverage of Title VII.\u201d In other words, male-on-male sexual harassment in the workplace does not always violate Title VII; it does so only if it also \u201cmeets the statutory requirements.\u201d\n\nAs to what those \u201cstatutory requirements\u201d are, the Court explained:\n\nWe have never held that workplace harassment, even harassment between men and women, is automatically discrimination because of sex merely because the words used have sexual content or connotations. \u201cThe critical issue, Title VII\u2019s text indicates, is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.\u201d [Quoting concurring opinion of Justice Ginsburg in Harris v. Forklift Systems (1993) (underlining added).]\n\nDiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity does not expose \u201cmembers of one sex \u2026 to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.\u201d Oncale\u2019s reading of Title VII thus defeats, rather than supports, the brief\u2019s claim.\n\n* I initially messed up on the listing of former SGs and acting SGs. For some reason, the brief is also submitted on behalf of a former associate White House counsel, Karen Dunn.", "description": "Let\u2019s start with the amicus brief filed by Laurence Tribe and Joshua Matz on behalf of three former Solicitors General (Walter Dellinger, Theodore B.
