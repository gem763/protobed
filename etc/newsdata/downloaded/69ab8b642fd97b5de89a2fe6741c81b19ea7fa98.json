New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services/Handout via REUTERS\n\n(Reuters) - Harvard University expressed remorse on Friday for accepting millions of dollars in gifts from Jeffrey Epstein in the years before his 2008 sex crimes conviction and said it regretted its association with the disgraced financier.\n\nHarvard President Lawrence Bacow said Esptein donated about $9 million to the university between 1998 and 2007, before Esptein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in 2008. Harvard said it knowingly rejected a gift from Epstein in 2008 following his conviction, but that its internal review is still ongoing.\n\n\u201cJeffrey Epstein\u2019s crimes were repulsive and reprehensible,\u201d Bacow said in a letter addressed the university community. \u201cI profoundly regret Harvard\u2019s past association with him.\u201d\n\nThe university\u2019s statement came a day after revelations that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had accepted gifts from Epstein after his Florida conviction on prostitution so long as the donations remained anonymous.\n\nMIT\u2019s president acknowledged the donations on Thursday and said he signed a thank-you letter to Epstein in 2012.\n\nHarvard added that it will donate the total unspent balance of $186,000 to organizations that support victims of human trafficking and sexual assault.\n\n\u201cThis is an unusual step for the university, but we have decided it is the proper course of action under the circumstances of Epstein\u2019s egregiously repugnant crimes,\u201d Bacow said.\n\nEpstein was arrested on July 6 on federal charges for sex trafficking. Prosecutors said he recruited dozens of underage girls to give him massages and then sexually abused them. Epstein pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe wealthy 66-year-old money manager was found dead on Aug. 10 in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan. An autopsy concluded that he hanged himself.", "description": "Harvard University expressed remorse on Friday for accepting millions of dollars in gifts from Jeffrey Epstein in the years before his 2008 sex crimes conviction and said it regretted its association with the disgraced financier.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429467037&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1IK", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
