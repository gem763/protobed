Bedazzled but also troubled by his adopted country, he revealed a nation beset by despair and nagging inequality.\n\nThe resulting book, \u201cThe Americans,\u201d published in this country in 1959, inspired generations of photographers, writers, filmmakers and musicians and made Mr. Frank one of the most important visual artists of the 20th century.\n\nHe died at 94 on Sept. 9 at a hospital in Inverness, Nova Scotia. Kaelan Kleber, the associate director of Pace/MacGill Gallery in Manhattan, which represents Mr. Frank, confirmed his death but did not cite a specific cause.\n\n\u201cThe Americans\u201d was, in effect, a group portrait of the nation, honest and stark and not always flattering. Out of 27,000 images that Mr. Frank took during an almost year-long cross-country journey, only 83 stark black-and-white pictures appeared in the book.\n\nHis images of lonely people, lonesome roads and smoldering tensions of urban life were a riposte to the honey-hued picture essays of popular magazines of the time such as the Saturday Evening Post and Life.\n\n\n\nRobert Frank in 1952. (Courtesy of Elliott Erwitt/Magnum Photos)\n\n\u201cThe Americans\u201d was often considered a visual complement to Jack Kerouac\u2019s classic Beat Generation novel from 1957, \u201cOn the Road.\u201d Kerouac fashioned a memorable introduction to \u201cThe Americans,\u201d writing, \u201cWith one hand he sucked a sad poem of America onto film, taking rank among the tragic poets of the world.\u2019\u2019\n\nMr. Frank, who had an aversion to repeating himself, would later turn to filmmaking, collage and other forms of visual art, but with each passing year \u201cThe Americans\u201d seemed to grow in stature and influence.\n\n\u201cYou know where you were when John F. Kennedy was shot? I know where I was when I saw \u2018The Americans,\u2019 \u201d pop artist Ed Ruscha told the New York Times in 2015. \u201cI was aware of [photographer] Walker Evans\u2019s work. But I felt like those were still lives. Robert\u2019s work was life in motion.\u201d\n\nBruce Springsteen said he leafed through copies of \u201cThe Americans\u201d to stimulate ideas while writing songs. Mr. Frank\u2019s gritty, irregularly cropped images \u2014 seemingly shot from the hip or on the run \u2014 became the model for a generation of photographers such as Lee Friedlander, Nan Goldin and Garry Winogrand.\n\nIn \u201cThe Americans,\u201d Mr. Frank used his gift for \u201cstreet photography\u201d to portray archetypal figures such as hitchhikers, factory workers, prostitutes, cross-dressers walking on New York streets and African American men at a South Carolina funeral.\n\n\n\nRobert Frank, \u201cParade \u2014 Hoboken, New Jersey,\u201d 1955 (Courtesy of Pace/MacGill)\n\nTwo of his masterworks, \u201cPolitical Rally \u2014 Chicago\u201d and \u201cTrolley \u2014 New Orleans,\u201d crystallized the themes of alienation and isolation that Mr. Frank saw lurking beneath the prosperous image of 1950s America.\n\n\u201cI was tired of romanticism,\u201d he said nearly 60 years later. \u201cI wanted to present what I saw, pure and simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolitical Rally,\u201d taken at the 1956 Democratic National Convention, depicts a faceless tuba player standing detached from the half-seen people next to him. In \u201cTrolley,\u201d Mr. Frank captures the indignity of racism by showing black and white passengers occupying side-by-side window frames of the trolley car yet divided by race and social status.\n\nMr. Frank was particularly drawn to the African American experience at a time when much of the country was still segregated. While driving in Arkansas in November 1955, he was stopped by police officers. Noticing that he spoke with a foreign accent and had a bottle of Hennessy cognac in his glove box, the officers asked Mr. Frank if he was a \u201ccommie.\u201d He spent several hours in the local jail.\n\n\u201cThat trip I got to like black people so much more than white people,\u201d he later said.\n\nBack on the road and blessed with an uncanny ability to hide in plain sight, Mr. Frank blended into the often cramped spaces of restrooms, elevators, bus stations and lunch counters.\n\nHe \u201cwas working against the currents of his time,\u201d said Sarah Greenough, senior photography curator at the National Gallery of Art, which presented a retrospective of \u201cThe Americans\u201d in 2009.\n\n\u201cWhile most magazines and other photographers were publishing pictures of America that celebrated American life as wholesome and optimistic \u2014 all Mom and apple pie \u2014 Frank looked beneath the surface in America to reveal issues the country is still wrestling with to this day,\u201d Greenough said. \u201cHe depicted people plagued by racism, ill served by politicians, intoxicated by media and celebrities, and fascinated by the road itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Americans\u201d first came out in France in 1958, a year before renegade publisher Barney Rosset printed an English-language edition. Despite Kerouac\u2019s introductory praise, the book was not well received at first and was out of print within a year. Popular Photography magazine called it \u201ca wart-covered picture of America by a joyless man.\u201d\n\nBut by the late 1960s, \u201cThe Americans\u201d was gaining recognition as a cultural classic and was anointed one of the century\u2019s seminal photography collections.\n\nThe pictures \u201ctook us by ambush,\u201d John Szarkowski, the photography curator at New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art, told the Times in 1972. \u201cWe knew the America that they described, of course, but we knew it as one knows the background hum in a record player, not as a fact to recognize and confront. Nor had we understood that this stratum of our experience was a proper concern of artists.\u201d\n\nMr. Frank never abandoned still photography, but he had a restless artistic temperament. Before \u201cThe Americans\u201d had registered in the public imagination, he had moved on to making low-budget avant-garde films. Among his best known was his debut, \u201cPull My Daisy\u201d (1959), co-directed with painter Alfred Leslie.\n\n\u201cPull My Daisy\u201d had a scratchy, home-movie look and featured Beat eminences such as Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso and Peter Orlovsky taking part in mischievous, absurdist horseplay.\n\nIn 1972, Mr. Frank teamed with the Rolling Stones, and a photograph from \u201cThe Americans,\u201d depicting a collage of pictures on the wall of a tattoo parlor, was used for the cover of the band\u2019s classic album \u201cExile on Main St.\u201d\n\nMr. Frank joined the Stones on tour, filming the band before, during and after its concerts.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t care about the music,\u201d he told the Times in 2015. \u201cI cared about them. It was great to watch them \u2014 the excitement. But my job was after the show. What I was photographing was a kind of boredom. It\u2019s so difficult being famous. It\u2019s a horrendous life.\u201d\n\nThe result was an explicitly titled, little-seen but infamous film. The documentary captured the exuberance of the Stones\u2019 live performances, but it also depicted the unbridled, hedonistic excesses of the rock-and-roll life, including drug use and debauchery.\n\nLitigation prevented the film from being commercially released. It was shown only rarely.\n\nMr. Frank produced more than 30 documentaries, films that had limited commercial appeal but were cited as formative influences by filmmakers such as Jim Jarmusch and Richard Linklater.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Mr. Frank returned to still photography, after a fashion, often creating collages out of his images. As \u201cThe Americans\u201d was rediscovered, Mr. Frank\u2019s early photography increasingly came to be the subject of museum exhibitions. By the 21st century, original prints from \u201cThe Americans\u201d sold for well into six figures.\n\nRobert Louis Frank was born in Zurich on Nov. 9, 1924. His German-born Jewish father imported record players and radios. He did not want to follow his father into that trade, regarding it as dull and confining.\n\nHis artistic escape was photography, which he learned through apprenticeships. His portfolio proved so impressive that, after arriving in New York in 1947, he won commercial photography assignments for Harper\u2019s Bazaar and other publications.\n\nBut his frustration with the strictures of journalism led him on photographic sojourns to South America and Europe.\n\nMr. Frank also cultivated the friendship of two eminent photographers, Edward Steichen and Walker Evans. They helped him win a Guggenheim Foundation grant, which he used to finance his travels for \u201cThe Americans.\u201d Evans\u2019s \u201cAmerican Photographs\u201d (1938) served as Mr. Frank\u2019s artistic road map for \u201cThe Americans.\u201d (Mr. Frank became a U.S. citizen in 1963.)\n\nIn 1950, he married Mary Lockspeiser, a British-born artist, and they had two children before divorcing. In 1975, he wed sculptor June Leaf, his ex-wife\u2019s close friend. She survives.\n\nMr. Frank endured several private tragedies, including the death of his daughter, Andrea, in a plane crash in the Guatemalan jungle in 1974. Around the same time, his frequent artistic collaborator Danny Seymour vanished on a sailboat off the Colombian coast.\n\nIn the aftermath of Andrea\u2019s death, his son Pablo Frank was eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia and died by suicide in 1994. The losses had an indelible effect on Mr. Frank\u2019s art. His photography took on a darker character, and he began to merge images together or add scratches or words to his prints.\n\nDespite the personal setbacks, Mr. Frank continued to publish books and make films. His New York studio was a jumble of detritus from a creative life, including the word \u201cEAT\u201d scrawled on a wall by bohemian musician and writer Patti Smith. In his later years, the National Gallery of Art acquired many of Mr. Frank\u2019s photographic works, including the film and contact sheets from \u201cThe Americans.\u201d\n\nMr. Frank was given to gnomic comments about his life and work, but his guiding motto was as clear and uncompromising as one of his photographs of America.\n\n\u201cLess taste and more spirit,\u201d he said. \u201cLess art and more truth.\u201d", "description": "Shooting in black and white, he trained his lens on inequality and despair in post-World War II life and became one of the most important visual artists of the 20th century.", "authors": ["Andrew Marton", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8przhCjGtfZVvGT6nREvBeNpeZY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/43P3YPWT7QI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
