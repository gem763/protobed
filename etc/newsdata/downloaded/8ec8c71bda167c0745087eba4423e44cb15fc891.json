But, as you\u2019d expect, it was not a log. It was a ferocious saltwater crocodile, 9News reports.\n\n\u201cI actually climbed on and stood on top of the croc for 15 seconds,\u201d Elston said. \u201cMy cousin then told me I was standing on top of its back, and in a split second he spun me around and knocked me over.\u201d\n\nThe apex predator then began attacking the man, a fight that usually has lethal consequences for the human.\n\n\u201cHe started flipping me and I hit the bank, then he attacked.\u201d\n\nThankfully, Elston was a quick-thinker and began to fight back against the wild animal. After a few kicks to the nose, Elston managed to free himself from the deathly jaws of the croc.\n\n\u201cI pushed it and kicked it in the nose three times, and he let me go,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not quite that easy to win a fight with an apex predator. The animal turned around and chased Elston back up the riverbank, managing to attack him for a second time.\n\n\u201cI kept on dragging myself up the bank, and all I saw was a big splash,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen he came up with his jaws open, I spread my left leg and he got me on the shorts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI held the jaw with my right hand, and I hammered it with my left hand, so I hit it four times,\u201d Elston described.\n\nElston eventually managed to escape after defeating the beast once again, but he was still dripping with blood in a riverbank with a monstrous crocodile just metres away. The saltwater crocodile was believed to be between 4.5 and 5 metres long.\n\nHe managed to run for his life with blood gushing from his leg wound, telling 9News that he was thinking of surviving for the sake of his children.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my kids, I wouldn\u2019t be alive right now.\u201d\n\nElston Lami Lami is currently in a stable condition in hospital and is expected to make a full recover.", "description": "A Northern Territory man has escaped a gnarly crocodile attack in Arnhem Land by repeatedly punching the crocodile in the nose.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-142090712-1024x683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
