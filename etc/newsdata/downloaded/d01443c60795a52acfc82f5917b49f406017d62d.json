REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\n\n\u201cIn recent months the number of accounts opened from Britain has trebled,\u201d one person at the wealth management arm of a large international bank in Switzerland said.\n\nSwiss banks do not disclose details of their clients but the sources said that most of the accounts opened by British-based clients were for high net worth British nationals wanting to shift some assets to safe-haven Switzerland.\n\nThis trend had clearly intensified in recent weeks, a source at a large Swiss bank said.\n\nWealthy Britons wanted to protect their assets also against the possibility of a high-tax Labour government coming to power soon, another source said.\n\nThe British pound GBP= has lost 17-18% against the dollar and the euro since the UK's vote on EU membership in June 2016. With just weeks to go before Britain's deadline to leave the EU on Oct. 31, the terms of the UK's departure, and possible ramifications for its economy, are still unclear.\n\nOne Swiss private banker said his bank had also drawn more customers from Britain over the past three to six months.\n\nA source at the Swiss wealth management arm of a second international bank said rich Britons were particularly afraid that the Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn would win an expected UK election soon and find ways to get a share of their money.\n\n\u201cMore than anything else, people are afraid of Corbyn,\u201d the person said.\n\nSwiss banks like UBS (UBSG.S) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) are among the world\u2019s biggest wealth managers, favoured in part for Switzerland\u2019s economic and political stability. The Swiss franc is also popular as a safe-haven investment at times of uncertainty.\n\nStatistics compiled by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) show Britons held nearly $19 billion (\u00a315.45 billion) in Switzerland as of the end of March, the most recent figures available. That is off peaks of around $30 billion during the financial crisis.\n\nLuxembourg is another attractive offshore market for wealthy Britons. British residents had parked more than $14 billion in Luxembourg as of the end of March, and the trend had been on the rise since in the past three years, BIS data shows.", "description": "Swiss private banks have seen a sharp rise in British clients who are moving assets offshore to escape a chaotic Brexit, several sources familiar with the situation told Reuters.", "authors": ["Angelika Gruber", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436627998&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920VX"}
