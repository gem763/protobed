(Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Reuters)\n\nApple on Thursday withdrew an app that enabled protesters to track police movements after heavy backlash from Chinese and Hong Kong authorities.\n\nThe app, HKmap.live, represented clusters of police with the emoji of a dog, an insult that has been shouted at Hong Kong police during the ongoing protests in the city.\n\nOfficials in Hong Kong told the company the app was being used to attack police. On Wednesday the Chinese Communist Party newspaper People\u2019s Daily published an editorial attacking Apple for aiding \u201crioters\u201d in the city.\n\n\u201cLetting poisonous software have its way is a betrayal of the Chinese people\u2019s feelings,\u201d the editorial stated.\n\nApple released a statement saying Hong Kong authorities have verified that the app has been used to \u201cthreaten public safety,\u201d and that criminals have also been using it to avoid police.\n\n\u201cI think the [Communist Party] concludes from this that intimidation, harassment and pressure work for most people, in most places,\u201d Human Rights Watch China researcher Maya Wang said in comments to the Times.\n\nMost of Apple\u2019s products are assembled in China, and the nation represents the company\u2019s third-largest market after the U.S. and Europe.\n\nChina-U.S. relations have soured in recent days following various conflicts between the Chinese government and American officials and entities.\n\nOn Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced visa restrictions on Chinese officials believed to have taken part in the repression of China\u2019s Uighur Muslim minority. Pompeo\u2019s announcement came after the Commerce Department imposed an export blacklist on several Chinese firms implicated in surveillance and detention of Uighurs.\n\nMeanwhile, the NBA recently found itself embroiled in a scandal after Congress members accused it of kowtowing to China\u2019s repressive policies regarding pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.", "description": "The app, HKmap.live, represented clusters of police with the emoji of a dog, an insult that has been shouted at police during ongoing protests in the city.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Jim Geraghty", "Victor Davis Hanson", "John Mccormack", "Rich Lowry", "Andrew C.
