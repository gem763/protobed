The video was 35 minutes long. Two people were killed in the attack, German police said earlier in the day.\n\n\"We are shocked and saddened by the tragedy that took place in Germany today, and our deepest condolences go out to all those affected,\" a Twitch spokesperson said. \"Twitch has a zero-tolerance policy against hateful conduct, and any act of violence is taken extremely seriously. We are working with urgency to remove this content and permanently suspend any accounts found to be posting or reposting content of this abhorrent act.\"\n\nIt shows the growing problem that streaming platforms are facing: When people want to commit evil, they can broadcast their crimes to an audience using social networks, which can amplify their reach.\n\nTwitch is a platform that was built to allow video gamers to livestream their games while chatting with their audience. Other companies have dealt with similar problems.\n\nThe footage is no longer on Twitch. CNBC was able to find links to download the video on other sites including 4Chan, however.\n\nThe New Zealand mosque massacre, which claimed 50 lives, was livestreamed to Facebook in March. Facebook said it worked to remove 1.5 million videos of the attack that were posted in 24 hours after it was initially streamed, and that 1.2 million of them were \"blocked at upload,\" by Facebook. YouTube, Twitter and Reddit also removed versions of the New Zealand livestream from their sites.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Lauren Feiner contributed to this report.\n\nFollow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech product news.", "description": "The alleged shooter in Halle, Germany, livestreamed the killing on Amazon's Twitch platform Wednesday.
