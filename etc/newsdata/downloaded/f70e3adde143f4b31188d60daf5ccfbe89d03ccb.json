Some take dips in nearby ponds.\n\n\n\nThe ranch, 150 kilometres southwest of Edmonton, is in a picturesque part of Alberta known more for cattle and horses.\n\nShane Juuti started his yak ranch in 1996 after buying a bull at auction.

What am I going to do with one bull yak?\u2019 So I bought a cow off a guy who'd bought several cows. And a week later she calved. Then it just kind of grew from there.\u201d\n\nYak milk can be used on its own, or to make butter or soap. But the meat seems most popular.\n\n\u201cMost of what we do is, we sell meat from the animals to try to hit a natural market, just because they're easy to market that way and raised in that direction,\u201d Juuti said.\n\nJuuti has captured a niche market, and says he can barely keep up with demand.

Now it\u2019s being touted for its lower cholesterol and lower fat content when compared to traditional livestock.\n\n\n\nSpecialty stores carry Juuti\u2019s yak meat, and Alberta restaurants have served his products. Business is booming, he said, and it has been tough to keep up with demand.\n\n\u201cIn fact, we're struggling to come up with enough animals for slaughter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's taken a while to get there, but now all of a sudden we've got stores taking it.\u201d\n\nYak meat in Canada is a niche market. It can\u2019t be found in national grocery chains.\n\nIn fact, it appears to be somewhat of an Alberta phenomenon.\n\nIn the past five years, the yak slaughter has become more concentrated in the province. In fact, of the 68 animals slaughtered at provincially or federally inspected abattoirs so far this year, 64 were in Alberta.\n\n\u201cThere's a lot of interest in traditional game meats from individuals who consume paleo diets,\u201d said Amy Proulx, a professor at the Canadian Food and Wine Institute at Niagara College.\n\n\u201cSo yak provides a really intriguing meat product that has a very good fatty acid profile and is high in protein.\u201d\n\nYak meat is used in northern Asian cuisine and sometimes featured in restaurants looking for unique, locally sourced products.\n\n\u201cIt's typically going to be high-end consumers in fine dining establishments looking for a really extraordinary culinary experience,\u201d Proulx said.\n\nJuuti thinks his decision to raise yak rather than cattle has paid off. He\u2019s barely involved in calving, even in the winter.\n\n\u201cI find them way less maintenance than the cows and easier to deal with than the cattle,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that's why I'd have a hard time switching back to cows from yaks.\u201d\n\nYaks are native to the Himalayan region, which makes them a decent fit for the Alberta climate.\n\nLife on a yak farm. Watch how Juuti's days are spent with his herd!\n\n\n\n\u201cThey don't like the heat. If it starts getting much above 20 degrees they want to get out on a hill where they can get some wind, or else they like to go in the dugout to go swimming if it gets very warm.\u201d\n\nJuuti hopes the current demand for yak meat continues to be steady. He said he\u2019s happy to help other farmers breed the animals to get their farms started.\n\nAsked if he sees himself as a yak pioneer in Alberta, he laughed.\n\n\"I never thought about it,\" he said. \"This wasn't the plan when we started \u2026 to have 400 head.\"", "description": "Shane Juuti started raising yaks almost by accident.
