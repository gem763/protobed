Give them the trophy now. Absolutely, I'm so sure they will win it now. They are eight points clear and playing well.\n\n\"If Manchester City were playing great then maybe not - but they have lost two games. They have lost to Wolves at home which everyone thought was an absolute certainty and they got beat at Norwich. Norwich recently got beat 5-1 by Aston Villa at home.\n\n\"So they have lost two games that they usually wouldn't. They haven't even played the tough games yet, they have got them to come. I can't see Man City doing it this year.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nInstead, former Tottenham boss Redknapp believes Guardiola will prioritise the Champions League - a competition he won twice as Barcelona manager but one that has so far eluded him in Manchester.\n\n\"I think if they are going to win anything this year, it will be the Champions League,\" Redknapp added.\n\n\"This is their year. They want to win that. Liverpool will want to win the Premier League, they've won the Champions League. Now they want to win the league. And I think that is what we will see this year.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWhile the blue half of Manchester eye top honours this year, City's fierce rivals Manchester United are enduring their worst start to a Premier League campaign in 30 years.\n\nAnd Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's fallen giants, who host Liverpool in the Premier League this Sunday, have already been ruled out of the top-four race by Redknapp.\n\nHe added: \"I can't see them finishing in the top four, no way. I'll be honest with you, I watched their Arsenal game the other week and there wasn't a player on the pitch who would have got in the Man United team a few years ago.\n\n(Image: McDonald's)\n\n(Image: McDonald's)\n\n\"(Roy) Keane, (Paul) Scholes, (Ryan) Giggs, (David) Beckham, (Rio) Ferdinand, (Nemanja) Vidic. Andy Cole. Dwight Yorke. Teddy Sheringham. They were difference class.\n\n\"Everyone keeps saying how great the game is nowadays but there isn't one player on that pitch who would have got into those teams in my opinion.\"\n\nHarry Redknapp was speaking at a McDonald\u2019s Fun Football Session where he helped deliver the 2,000,000th hour of the Fun Football programme.
