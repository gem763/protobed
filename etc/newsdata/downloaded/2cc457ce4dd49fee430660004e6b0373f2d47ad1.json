We already know that the adaptation of the book published by The New York Times left out the tidbit that the women supposedly sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh in college didn\u2019t recall the incident, and now Hemingway is fact-checking The Atlantic\u2019s take on the Kavanaugh smear.\n\nGuess who caught the New York Times' Kavanaugh authors in another huge error? This time in the Atlantic. \"Witnesses Defended Kavanaugh. NYT Authors Falsely Claimed Silence\" https://t.co/keStoBFRuD \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 17, 2019\n\nShe writes at The Federalist:\n\nA new Atlantic-published, adapted excerpt of the book attempts to resurrect Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s anti-Kavanaugh smears but once again has a major error. \u201cWe Spent 10 Months Investigating Kavanaugh. Here\u2019s What We Found\u201d was published in the Atlantic. Their reporting must not have been thorough. In a section explaining why they believe the accusers despite the lack of any evidence, they write that their emotional reaction to the claims was that the claims rang true. But they get major facts wrong\u2026. \u2026 It is not true that the alleged witnesses kept mum. This is another major error by The New York Times reporters.\n\nHemingway says she\u2019ll update The Federalist piece once The Atlantic corrects this latest error.\n\nGood grief. Is there no end to this shoddy reporting? https://t.co/0ElPBcmAMz \u2014 Brit Hume (@brithume) September 17, 2019\n\nNot shoddy reporting. Purposeful smear job. \u2014 RCarls (@RCarls1) September 17, 2019\n\nAt some point a rational observer would have to reject \"shoddy\" in favor of the more accurate \"corrupt\" \u2014 Every Doggo Knows (@EveryDoggoKnows) September 17, 2019\n\nYou say shoddy reporting, I say partisan hacks. \u2014 Aviva (@avivalev) September 17, 2019\n\nWhen did you see reporting from them that was NOT shoddy? \u2014 GlenninVirginia (@GlenninVirginia) September 17, 2019\n\nCan we stop calling them \"journalists\" and \"reporters\"? How about \"media activists\"? \u2014 Sam in LA (@Sam42199640) September 17, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s purposely deceptive. Labeling it as just \u201cshoddy\u201d gives the @nytimes an out as \u201cmistakes were made.\u201d No mistakes were made. They omitted & lied on purpose. It is who they are.. just the propaganda department of the @TheDemocrats \u2014 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8John \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@DaBearsk35) September 17, 2019\n\nIMO, this is not shoddy reporting. This is an intentional attempt to manipulate the voting public with scurrilous lies. But I think it is backfiring. \u2014 Susan F (@SMF904) September 17, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s not shoddy reporting. It\u2019s Democratic activists doing what they do. \u2014 Len Redfern (@len_redfern) September 17, 2019\n\nThis has become a plague! We have always relied on the media, since our Republic was formed, to be a watchdog of the checks and balances. This reporting, this fiction, this distortion of reality is a loss for all of us. It is the death of our safety net. \u2014 Julie Colin (@JulieColin) September 17, 2019\n\nIt's not even reporting. All the people who worked so hard for NYT reputation had it all get ruined. And for what? \u2014 thomas gilson jr (@tommygi80) September 17, 2019\n\nIs it surprising, Brit? When you are trying to prop up a completely ridiculous national narrative, how could there be anything but egregious and corrupt journalism in play. \u2014 Tim Tedesco (@TimTedesco135) September 18, 2019\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s far more than shoddy reporting. \u2014 Robert DePree (@rightly) September 18, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s not reporting. It\u2019s full on propaganda \u2014 Susan Metz (@Susan_Metz) September 18, 2019\n\nIt's not shoddy reporting, it's a designed plan even if a few reporters lose a little credibility. \u2014 Jerry Vis (@quietsolopursui) September 17, 2019\n\nYou misspelled \"malicious propaganda\" \u2014 Jake Lee (@fiat_justitia_) September 17, 2019\n\nNot until somebody gets sued into oblivion. There\u2019s apparently next to zero accountability in members of media spewing whatever falsehoods they wish. \u2014 Sect 35, Row 72 (@md_schmidt) September 17, 2019\n\nBeyond the news it breaks, \"The Education of Brett Kavanaugh\" is a book-length reminder of the derision with which some sexual-misconduct allegations are still treated. @megangarber writes: https://t.co/VutQqjnvyX \u2014 The Atlantic (@TheAtlantic) September 17, 2019\n\nCould you let me know when you correct the error I identified in the excerpt of the book you published?
