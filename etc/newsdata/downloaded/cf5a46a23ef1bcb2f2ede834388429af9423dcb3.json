He said Mr. Sondland had been prepared and happy to testify, and would do so in the future if allowed.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland is profoundly disappointed that he will not be able to testify today,\u201d Mr. Luskin said. \u201cAmbassador Sondland believes strongly that he acted at all times in the best interests of the United States, and he stands ready to answer the committee\u2019s questions fully and truthfully.\u201d\n\nMr. Sondland has become enmeshed in the burgeoning scandal into how the president sought to push the Ukrainians to investigate his political rivals. Although Ukraine is not in the union, Mr. Trump instructed Mr. Sondland \u2014 a wealthy hotelier and campaign contributor \u2014 to take a lead in relations between the Trump administration and the country. Democrats consider him a key witness to what transpired between the two countries.\n\nMr. Sondland interacted directly with Mr. Trump, speaking with the president several times around key moments that House Democrats are now investigating, including before and after Mr. Trump\u2019s July call with the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. The president asked Mr. Zelensky on the call to do him \u201ca favor\u201d and investigate the business dealings of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s son and a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nText messages provided to Congress last week showed that Mr. Sondland and another senior diplomat had worked on language for a statement they wanted the Ukrainian president to put out in August that would have committed him to the investigations sought by Mr. Trump. The diplomats consulted with Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, about the statement, believing they needed pacify him in order to allow the United States to normalize relations with the Ukrainians.", "description": "The decision to block Gordon D.
