I should not have said it on air or posted it on Twitter. I was wrong to do so.\u201d\n\nWHITE HOUSE SLAMS MSNBC FOR UNVERIFIED REPORT, SAYS LEFT-WING OUTLETS HAVE 'WEAPONIZED' THE MEDIA\n\nO\u2019Donnell then said NBC would retract the story because \u201cit wasn\u2019t ready for broadcast.\u201d\n\nNBC News did not immediately respond when asked if the company stands by O\u2019Donnell and if the host would be disciplined. NBC\u2019s parent company, Comcast, did not immediately respond to the same inquiries.\n\nWhile NBC and its corporate parent remains silent, President Trump has been quite vocal about the situation.\n\n\u201cCrazy Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, who has been calling me wrong from even before I announced my run for the Presidency, even being previously forced by NBC to apologize, which he did while crying, for things he said about me & The Apprentice, was again forced to apologize, this time ... for the most ridiculous claim of all, that Russia, Russia, Russia, or Russian oligarchs, co-signed loan documents for me, a guarantee,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nCNN HAS BAD WEEK AMID APRIL RYAN, CHRIS CUOMO AND DON LEMON NEWS: \u2018IT WAS QUITE EMBARRASSING\u2019\n\n\u201cTotally false, as is virtually everything else he, and much of the rest of the LameStream Media, has said about me for years. ALL APOLOGIZE!\u201d he continued.\n\nMinutes later, he added: \u201cThe totally inaccurate reporting by Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, for which he has been forced by NBC to apologize, is NO DIFFERENT than the horrible, corrupt and fraudulent Fake News that I (and many millions of GREAT supporters) have had to put up with for years. So bad for the USA!\u201d\n\nThe retraction and apology came after Trump's legal team sent a harshly worded letter to NBC Wednesday demanding the apology and retraction for \u201cfalse and defamatory, and extremely damaging\u201d comments made by the MSNBC primetime host. NBC News didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about the blistering letter prior to the retraction, either.\n\nThe fiery letter came shortly after White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham blasted O\u2019Donnell over the story in a statement to Fox News.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the reasons that a majority of Americans have lost trust in the media. Instead of applying ethics and standards to their reporting, journalists and left-wing outlets have weaponized the media, using it to attack and harass people with little to no regard for the truth,\u201d Grisham said.\n\nTRUMP DEMANDS APOLOGY FROM NBC NEWS OVER 'FALSE AND DEFAMATORY' REPORT, THREATENS LEGAL ACTION IN SCORCHING LETTER\n\nThe incident occurred on Tuesday night when O\u2019Donnell and fellow far-left MSNBC host Rachel Maddow were discussing how Trump was \u201cable to obtain loans when no one else would loan him any money\u201d when he tossed out the unverified speculation.\n\n\u201cI may have some information, in this next hour, which would add a great deal to their understanding of that, if true, and I\u2019ll be discussing it here,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \"I stress \u2018if true,\u2019 because this is a single source who has told me that Deutsche Bank obtained tax returns\u2026 this single source close to Deutsche Bank has told me that Donald Trump\u2019s loan documents there show that he has cosigners. That\u2019s how he was able to obtain those loans and that the cosigners are Russian oligarchs.\"\n\nA stunned Maddow leaned back in her chair and responded, \u201cWhat? Really?\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nO\u2019Donnell added \u201cthat would explain every kind word Donald Trump has ever said about Russia and Vladimir Putin\u201d if his information is accurate.\n\nFox News\u2019 Brooke Singman contributed to this report.", "description": "NBC News remained\u00a0silent Thursday morning regarding whether or not MSNBC host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell will face disciplinary action after being forced to apologize and retract a singled-sourced, unverified report\u00a0\u2013\u00a0which bypassed the network's standards \u2013\u00a0claiming\u00a0President Trump possibly had loans co-signed by Russian oligarchs.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
