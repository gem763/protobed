At this stage we believe it is a safe procedure.'\n\nDr Hussain said that women who chose to use the transplant surgery over implants would only see an increase by one cup size.\n\nThe surgery involving fat transfer can cost anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000.\n\nAustralian cosmetic surgeons have said the recovery is much quicker and less painful than patients who have implants put in (file image)\n\nAccording to the Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons, macro-textured implants have a one in 10,000 risk of breast cancer has micro-textured implants have a risk of one in 50,000.\n\nAustralia's peak body for cosmetic surgeons said there's no cause for alarm for people who have textured breast implants, and to consider all evidence before taking action.\n\nThe Australasian College of Cosmetic Surgery also said the risks of developing a cancer that spreads is extremely small.\n\n'If patients do not have any symptoms, there is no need for any action because of this TGA announcement,' the College said.", "description": "A six-month ban was issued by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration of eight types of breast implants in September due to concerns they were linked to forms of blood cancer.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/02/19909628-0-image-a-4_1571450018920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
