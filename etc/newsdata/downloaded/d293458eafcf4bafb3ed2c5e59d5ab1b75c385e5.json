Data for August was revised downward to show private payrolls increasing by 157,000 jobs instead of the previously reported 195,000 positions.\n\nThe ADP figures come ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report due out on Friday, which includes both public- and private-sector employment.\n\n\"I believe that Friday's nonfarm payrolls will come in weaker than forecast,\" said Kevin Giddis, chief fixed income strategist at Raymond James in Memphis, Tennessee. \"In my opinion, a number below 100,000 is likely more probable. It just has that feeling.\"\n\nAccording to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 145,000 jobs in September, after rising 130,000 in August. Job gains have averaged 158,000 per month this year, above the roughly 100,000 needed each month to keep up with growth in the working age population.\n\nThe unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 3.7% for a fourth straight month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst though, there will be data on the US services sector. \"The ISM non-manufacturing index is expected to decline modestly to 55.1 in September following the notable 2.7 increase to 56.4 in August,\" TD said, which \"would suggest the services sector remains largely healthy despite the worsening outlook for the industrial sector\".\n\nMeantime, investors continue to reposition.\n\n\"The souring in the risk sentiment triggered a bid in US Treasury yields with shorter date tenors leading the decline,\" NAB FX strategist Rodrigo Catril said in a note. \"The 2y rate fell 6.2bps to 1.485% and the 10y note now trades at 1.5957, 3.5bps lower on the day.\n\n\"The down trend in 10y UST yields evident since late 2018 remains in place and now with the move sub 1.60% many will be looking at the previous low of 1.467% as the next major resistance,\" Mr Catril also said.\n\nThe sharp move on the short end has increased the prospects of the Fed lowering the funds rate again later in the month, Mr Catril said. \"Since Monday pricing expectations for an October Fed funds rate cut have increased from 41% to 74% currently, this has been a drag for the USD.\"\n\nToday's agenda\n\nLocal: AiG performance of services September, Trade balance August\n\nTD on the pending trade data: \"Iron ore exports to China were very healthy in August despite a flare up in trade tensions, while a drop in oil prices should help reduce Australia\u2019s import bill. We pencil in a $7500m surplus for the August Trade Balance.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOverseas data: Euro zone PPI August, Retail sales August; UK Markit/CIPS services PMI September; US Markit services PMI September, Factory orders August, Durable goods orders August, ISM non-manufacturing September, Fed speakers: Evans, Quarles, Mester, Kaplan\n\nMarket highlights\n\nASX futures were down 120 points or 1.8% to 6493 near 7.45am AEST\n\nAUD flat at 67.06 US cents\n\nOn Wall St: Dow -1.9% S &P 500 -1.8% Nasdaq -1.6%\n\nIn New York: BHP -2.7% Rio -3.2% Atlassian -1.2%\n\nIn Europe: Stoxx 50 -3% FTSE -3.2% CAC -3.1% DAX -2.8%\n\nNikkei 225 futures -1.6%\n\nSpot gold +1.5% to $US1501.83 an ounce at 1.22pm New York time\n\nBrent crude -2.1% to $US57.63 a barrel\n\nUS oil -1.9% to $US52.60 a barrel\n\nIron ore flat at $US93.38 a tonne\n\nChinese markets are closed for national holidays\n\nLME aluminium -2% to $US1706 a tonne\n\nLME copper -0.1% to $US5678 a tonne\n\n2-year yield: US 1.48% Australia n/a\n\n5-year yield: US 1.43% Australia n/a\n\n10-year yield: US 1.60% Australia 0.96% Germany -0.55%\n\n10-year US/Australia yield gap near 7am AEST: 64 basis points\n\nFrom today's Financial Review\n\nLabor's business blitz discovers growth: Labor is working overtime to mend relations with business, while also shifting its policy emphasis away from tax and spend.\n\nPM accuses big banks of profiteering: The Prime Minister condemns the banks for not passing on the full RBA cash rate cut, saying they are profiteering.\n\nDoubts ACCC can win TPG case: A three-week court case challenging the ACCC ban on the $15 billion merger between Vodafone and TPG has left both sides confident of victory.

This data is indicating we are not immune to this trade dispute, that it\u2019s hurting us as well as China,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.\n\nThe focus is now on the Labor Department\u2019s more comprehensive jobs report on Friday for further clues on the health of the US economy.\n\nSouthBay Research is looking at NFP of 146,000; official forecast is 173,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEurope\n\n'Get ready for an election': Boris lays out battlelines: British PM doubles down on Brexit poker and echoes Scott Morrison's pitch to \"the forgotten people\".\n\nEuropean stock markets dived almost 3% to log their worst day since last December on Wednesday as the threat of a transatlantic trade war and dismal economic data added to fears about a faltering global economy.\n\nLosses in London were the most dramatic, with the FTSE 100 seeing its worst session in 3-1/2 years after Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled a final Brexit proposal that dimmed the chances of Britain leaving the European Union with a deal.\n\nIn Europe, Airbus dropped 2% and the benchmark STOXX 600 index gave up almost all of the past month's gains after the World Trade Organisation approved US moves to slap import tariffs on $US7.5 billion worth of European goods.\n\nGlobal equity markets are already reeling from a prolonged tit-for-tat battle between Washington and Beijing over trade, which has showed up this week in sharp falls in manufacturing sector indicators on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n\"We haven't seen the worst of the trade war impact yet and of course it's a big impact on (manufacturing in) Europe because it relies so much more on exports than US,\" said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard.\n\nThe losses drove the pan-European index below its 100-day moving average, seen as a strong technical support level that could spur further losses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of Europe's major markets tumbled more than 2%, with Italian shares losing 2.9% in their worst session since December, while French stocks gave up a full 3%.\n\nFrankfurt shares fell 2.8% to their lowest level in a month and have now fallen more than 4% in just two days.\n\nLatest Refinitiv data showed European companies could be set for their worst quarterly earnings period in three years as revenue drops for the first time since early 2018.\n\n\"It's going to be a tough season and the most important thing will be how the companies view going into Q4 and the early outlook for 2020, which is shaping up to be a tough year for markets and corporates,\" said Neil Campling, analyst at Mirabaud Securities.\n\nAsia\n\nJapanese shares fell on Wednesday after manufacturing activity in the United States contracted by the most in more than a decade, offering further evidence that the US-China trade war is slowing global growth.\n\nThe Nikkei average share price index ended down 0.49% at 21,778.61.\n\nThere were 150 decliners on the Nikkei index against 69 advancers on Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeavy equipment makers and exporters led declines as any weakness in the United States - a major market for Japanese capital goods - and a slightly stronger yen could impact corporate profits.\n\nThe largest losers in the index by percentage were Nissan Chemical down 5.4%, followed by Rakuten losing 4.8% and Yaskawa Electric down by 4.2%.\n\nCurrencies\n\nGoldman pegs potential RBA bond buying at $200b: Goldman Sachs economists say the RBA's internal economic model suggests the central bank will need to unleash a $200 billion bond-buying stimulus to push up inflation to its target.\n\nTrader sues Citigroup for $167m, alleging malicious prosecution: Rohan Ramchandani was earlier acquitted by a jury in New York of using an online chatroom to fix prices in the foreign exchange market.\n\nSterling rebounded from earlier lows on Wednesday as hedge funds covered some of their short bets against the currency after Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a final Brexit offer to the European Union.\n\nThe pound had earlier weakened 0.5% to $US1.2227, but recouped all its losses after Johnson's speech to his Conservative party's annual conference, and the EU's response, to trade flat at $US1.2311. It had hit a four-week low of $US1.2205 in the previous session.\n\nVersus the euro, the pound was a shade weaker at 88.94 pence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohnson said unless the bloc compromised, Britain would leave without a deal at the end of the month.\n\nCommodities\n\nCopper prices fell on Wednesday after data showed manufacturing output contracted in the United States and Europe, suggesting metals demand will remain weak.\n\nBenchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) ended down 0.1% at $US5678 a tonne, nearing a more than two-year low of $US5518 reached on September 3.\n\nThe metal used in power and construction has slumped more than 20% since June last year, when US President Donald Trump began a trade war with China that has rippled through global markets and dented economic output.\n\n\"Negative sentiment has now fed through to the real underlying data, which has made for grim reading,\" said BMO Capital Markets analyst Kash Kamal.\n\nBut he said state-backed infrastructure spending in China, the largest metals consumer, would support prices, predicting an average copper price of about $US5950 over October-December.\n\nLME nickel closed 1.5% up at $US17,485 a tonne, aluminium finished 2% down at $US1706, zinc rose 0.6% to $US2318, lead gained 0.2% to $US2100 and tin ended 1.9% higher at $US16,550.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAustralian sharemarket\n\nAustralian shares slumped to their biggest loss in seven weeks on Wednesday, as the weakest levels of factory activity in the US since the global financial crisis sparked fears a global recession could be imminent.\n\nThe S &P/ASX200 Index tumbled 103 points, or 1.5 per cent, to 6639.9 just a day after the Reserve Bank of Australia's quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut sent shares soaring.
