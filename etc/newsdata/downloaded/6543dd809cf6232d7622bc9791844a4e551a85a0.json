With ongoing US-China trade tensions and recession signals from the bond market, it's not surprising that the S&P 500 posted 11 moves of over 1%. What's more worrying is that it is unlikely the volatility will abate anytime soon. The Cboe Volatility Index remains at elevated levels- and in any case, September is a notoriously difficult month for the markets.\n\nSo where does this leave investors? Well one option is to tune in to the Street and see which stocks analysts are recommending right now. Here we take a closer look at seven stocks, all with recent bullish calls from Goldman Sachs. Furthermore, as you will see, each of these stocks shows over 20% upside potential from current levels- meaning now could be a compelling time to buy in. Let's take a closer look at which stocks are on Goldman's buy list now:\n\nUber Technologies Inc (UBER)\n\nFive-star Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry has a buy rating and $56 price target on ride-hailing giant Uber. From current levels that indicates impressive upside potential of 72%.\n\nHe clearly sees a buying opportunity from Uber\u2019s current weakness. Indeed, the stock is currently trading at just $33- a far cry from its IPO price of $45 back in May. That\u2019s with shares plunging 23% in August after Uber reported a huge net loss of $5.24 billion for Q219. Even without the \u2018one-off\u2019 hit of stock-based compensation, the loss still amounted to $1.3 billion- up around 30% from the first quarter.\n\n\u201cWhile there are considerable risks in ownership across the space given the intense competition, regulatory issues, and operating pressures, we continue to believe the risk/reward in owning the leader in this space is favorable and we remain Buy-rated\u201d Terry told investors. Plus Terry did note that Uber\u2019s core ride-hailing business generated $12.19 billion in Q2 gross bookings, beating the estimated $12.11 billion.\n\nIn total, UBER still earns a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 Street consensus. In the last three months the stock has scored 20 buy ratings and 6 hold ratings. At $55 the average analyst price target falls marginally below Terry\u2019s own estimate, and suggests upside potential of 68%.\n\nMicron Technology Inc (MU)\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney recently carried out a slew of tech stock upgrades. And one of the key stocks on his upgrade list was chip maker Micron.\n\nStory continues", "description": "August was a particularly volatile month for investors.
