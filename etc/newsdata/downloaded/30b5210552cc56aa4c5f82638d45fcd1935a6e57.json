There were two phenomenal quarterbacks, Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson, who dueled and dazzled. There were fourth-down conversions, two-point attempts and when it was all over, the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Baltimore Ravens 33-28 in the type of game that felt like a playoff preview.\n\nBut the Mahomes-Jackson showdown was an anomaly in this NFL season. Both quarterbacks were healthy. And a deluge of penalties didn\u2019t interrupt the action. They played a watchable football game.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t been the case much in the early going of the 2019 season. Injuries are a key reason why 40 different quarterbacks have already started games this season\u2014the most in the first three weeks on a non-strike year in the Super Bowl era. And games are being interrupted by penalties at a sky-high rate.\n\nHow teams adjust to this may come to define the 2019 season. When there\u2019s unprecedented upheaval at the most important position in the sport, teams\u2019 ability to deal with it will determine their fate, as it did Sunday. The Carolina Panthers won without Cam Newton, and the New Orleans Saints won sans Drew Brees.\n\nThe same can\u2019t be said for the Pittsburgh Steelers, who fell to 0-3 as they embark on a season without Ben Roethlisberger, or the New York Jets who dropped to 0-3 while starting their third quarterback in as many weeks.\n\nBut while everyone is worried about the health of quarterbacks, the players tasked with protecting them are being aggressively penalized. A surge in offensive holding penalties has been impossible to miss: up 36% over last season, according to Stats LLC.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m turning off this game,\u201d Patriots quarterback Tom Brady tweeted during the broadcast of last week\u2019s Thursday night football, when officials threw a flag for offensive holding 10 different times. \u201cI can\u2019t watch these ridiculous penalties anymore.\u201d\n\nThe NFL seemed to agree. The league\u2019s head of officiating spoke with officials on Saturday, and told them they could lighten up on the holding calls\u2014a penalty that had been emphasized over the off-season by the competition committee based on what they saw last year, when in their estimation there were offensive linemen getting away with too much.\n\nAfter the way the first couple of weeks played out, though, it was understandable why the league would want to de-emphasize precisely what they emphasized. There\u2019s an old adage about holding penalties\u2014that there\u2019s one on every single play\u2014and this year, that has become closer to a literal reality. Following the missive, holding calls returning to a more normal level in Week 3, down 16% from the first two weeks.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for the NFL to address these questions while it assesses how its rule tweaks are affecting the game on the field. Last year, there was an emphasis on helmet-rule penalties; that was jarring during the preseason, but became an afterthought as the season played out.\n\nBut the holding rule is salient because protecting the quarterback has become such a focal point of this season.\n\nThe injuries have been staggering: Brees went down last week with a thumb injury and will be out for weeks. Roethlisberger is expected to miss the entire season with an arm injury. Newton\u2019s potential to return to the Panthers from a foot injury is unclear. Nick Foles broke his clavicle, and nobody knows exactly when he will be back for the Jaguars. In the most unusual twist, the Jets\u2019 Sam Darnold has missed the last two weeks while he deals with mononucleosis.\n\nKyle Allen filled in for Cam Newton and led the Panthers to a win over the Cardinals.

The Jets, a trendy pick to compete for the playoffs this year based on Darnold\u2019s development in his second year, have started three quarterbacks in as many weeks and were uncompetitive in a 30-14 loss to the Patriots. The Steelers also fell on Sunday, with Mason Rudolph losing his first career start to the 49ers.\n\nThe Saints were able to survive. Buoyed by a punt return and fumble recovery both returned for scores, they won with Teddy Bridgewater and dealt the Seattle Seahawks their first loss.\n\nThe rash of injuries is creating some unusual matchups and even more surprising bright spots. During the holding-fest that Tom Brady turned off on Thursday night, Gardner Minshew, a sixth-round pick out of Washington State, led Jacksonville to a win over the Titans. And with a bespectacled Foles watching on the sidelines, the mustachioed Minshew showed the makings of someone the Jaguars have longed for: a young quarterback of the future.\n\nUnlike Minshew, Kyle Allen went completely undrafted. This time last year, he was completely unemployed. He was cut by the Panthers, then later brought back to be Cam Newton\u2019s backup. With Newton injured, he got the starting nod on Sunday against the Cardinals and Kyler Murray, his former college teammate.\n\nAllen shined with a performance that could earn him a more serious look down the road: he completed 19 of 26 passes and threw four touchdowns in a 38-20 win. That moved Carolina to just 1-2 on the year but more importantly gave the Panthers a grounded belief that they can win with Newton sidelined.\n\nDaniel Jones rallied the New York Giants to victory in his first career start.

He threw for 336 yards and two touchdowns, while running for two more scores.\n\nDown 18 points, Jones rallied the Giants back, capped off by a touchdown run to put New York ahead for good with 1:16 left. It was an uncanny display of poise and ability that was somehow familiar: it looked just like Manning did in his prime.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Do you agree with Tom Brady?
