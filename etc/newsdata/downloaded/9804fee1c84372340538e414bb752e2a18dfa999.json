And I am so ashamed and sorry for the impact of this crime committed here.\u201d\n\nHindus, Christians, Muslims and Sikhs were killed in April 1919 when they gathered in Amritsar, in Punjab, then part of British India. They were protesting peacefully after earlier riots over the arrest of pro-independence leaders.\n\nAmritsar, 100 years on, remains an atrocity Britain cannot be allowed to forget | Mihir Bose Read more\n\nUnder the orders of Brig Gen Reginald Dyer, an Anglican, British troops opened fire. According to official figures, 379 people were killed and about 1,200 wounded, though other estimates suggested much higher casualties.\n\nWinston Churchill condemned the massacre in the House of Commons, saying it was \u201can extraordinary event, a monstrous event, an event which stands in singular and sinister isolation\u201d.\n\nIn 2013, David Cameron became the first serving prime minister to visit the site of the killings, bowing his head in honour of the victims. The episode was \u201cdeeply shameful\u201d and should never be forgotten, he said, but he stopped short of apologising.\n\nThis year Theresa May called the killings a \u201cshameful scar\u201d in British-Indian history but also stopped short of formally apologising.\n\nWriting on Facebook during a trip to Sri Lanka and India, Welby said visiting the memorial had aroused \u201ca sense of profound shame at what happened in this place. It is one of a number of deep stains on British history.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cLearning of what happened, I recognise the sins of my British colonial history, the ideology that too often subjugated and dehumanised other races and cultures \u2026 We have a great responsibility to not just lament this horrific massacre but most importantly to learn from it in a way that changes our actions.\u201d", "description": "Archbishop says sorry \u2018in the name of Christ\u2019 over killing of 379 unarmed protesters in 1919", "authors": ["Harriet Sherwood", "Mihir Bose", "Amrit Wilson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13227e769a2e9895e3be4fe17c97dc4ab40d366a/0_236_6936_4162/master/6936.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b515d3885bc225092371273e9f444eaf", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
