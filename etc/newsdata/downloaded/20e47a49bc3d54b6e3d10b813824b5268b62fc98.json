For instance, the bitcoin bear market ended near $3,100 in mid-December 2018 and prices built a base below $4,000 in the following three months before breaking into a bull market on April 2.\n\nNotably, the bear market drop ran out of steam two months before the 50- and 10-week moving averages confirmed a bearish crossover (in February 2019).\n\nFurther, the new bull market began two months following the confirmation of the bearish crossover. That is hardly surprising as bearish crossovers of long duration MAs are big-time lagging indicators and often mark bear market bottoms.\n\nWhat\u2019s more interesting is that the previous bear market (2014) had also run out of steam in the run-up to the bearish crossover and the confirmation of the crossover was followed by a bullish breakout, as seen in the chart below.\n\nWeekly chart\n\nThe bear market, which began at the end of 2013, ran out of steam at lows near $150 in January 2015. The 50- and 100-week MAs produced a bearish cross in April and a bullish reversal was confirmed at the end of October 2015.\n\nNote that the bull market had stalled around $450 following a quick rise from $320 to $500 in November.\n\nThe cryptocurrency resumed the bull market in the last week of May 2016 after prices rose 18 percent and the 50- and 100-week MAs produced a bullish crossover.\n\nMore importantly, BTC went on to hit fresh record highs above $1,200 in February 2017.\n\nAs of now, BTC is trading around $10,300, having rallied from $4,000 to $13,880 in the second quarter. Essentially, the bull market has stalled in the last few weeks.\n\nWith history repeating itself, there is a strong reason to believe that the bullish crossover of the 50- and 100-week MAs, if and when, confirmed, could mark the beginning of a meteoric rise well above $20,000.\n\nCurrently, the 50- and 100-week MAs are located at $6,556 and $7,668, respectively.\n\nDisclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.\n\nBitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shutterstock_785329462.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
