It\u2019s his game.\n\nIn seven career postseason appearances, Strasburg has allowed just six earned runs in 41 innings pitched. He has struck out 57 and walked just five.\n\nIt\u2019s been a gradual but total transformation.\n\nStrasburg, always reluctant to speak much in the past, has become almost Buddha-like in his responses to questions such as the culture in the clubhouse, and how it has changed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s human nature \u2026 when things go wrong to maybe not want to look in the mirror and constantly say we don\u2019t really have that kind of feeling in the clubhouse,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s more so like picking each other up and sticking together. And we\u2019re just a tight-knit group of guys, and we talk about family a lot.\u201d\n\nThat sounds like a culture that is damn good.\n\nMax Scherzer may be one of the leaders of this team, but Strasburg has become the face \u2014 and the arm \u2014 symbolizing the dominating Nationals\u2019 starting pitching in the playoffs, setting the tone with his Game 2, six-inning, one-run 4-2 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL Division Series to even it at 1-1. It was a strong follow up to his three innings of shutout relief in Washington\u2019s 3-2 wild card victory on Oct. 1.\n\nHis counterparts on the mound \u2014 Anibal Sanchez and Scherzer \u2014 have turned in their own impressive starting performances, both carrying no-hitters late into games 1 and 2 against the Cardinals.\n\nBut this has been the coronation of Strasburg, the highly-touted 2009 No. 1 draft pick who has put together an impressive career \u2014 112-58 with a 3.17 ERA \u2013 but always heard the questions about his toughness.\n\nNow they ask why he is pitching so good.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
