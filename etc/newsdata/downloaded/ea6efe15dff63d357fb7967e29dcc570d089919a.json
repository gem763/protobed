A cavernous emptiness. An insatiable calling. A magnetic pull to another time, place, or loved one.\n\nSometimes, it\u2019s a deep hunger, a craving for a meal at your local Maccy\u2019s.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019ve encountered this at the end of a big night, or when you\u2019re en route to work and catch the whiff of a salty McMuffin.\n\nOr if you\u2019re anything like husband-wife duo Reuben and Hayley Szekely, this is a craving that has hit you right after you\u2019ve said: \u2018I do.\u2019\n\nThe loved-up, hungry couple were on the way to their wedding reception at The Old Hall Hotel in Buxton when they stopped at the Rawtenstall McDonald\u2019s for a cheeky cheeseburger and box of nuggies.\n\nThey even got the meal on the house, with all the staff rather keen to serve the dressed-up pair.\n\nFortunately, their wedding photographer was along for the ride, and managed to seamlessly capture the young couple living their fast food fairytale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The staff at McDonald\u2019s were amazing! Everyone in the restaurant had their phones out taking photos. I think we made their day!\u2019 photographer Paula Webster Mottram said in an Instagram caption.\n\n\u2018But what a fun couple. I just LOVE it when couples want to do something out of the ordinary.\u2019\n\nHayley, 22 and Reuben, 25, will set off on their Roman honeymoon in two weeks, where we imagine they might be dining on slightly fancier fare.\n\nSo, raise a cheeseburger to the happy couple.\n\nThese two aren\u2019t the first to welcome the golden arches into their special day. In 2017, a newly-married couple enjoyed their first meal as husband and wife at Maccy\u2019s, and in 2018, a bride handed out 400 cheeseburgers to her 450 wedding guests after a six-course meal.\n\nIf you have a brilliant wedding story to share, get in touch at MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The couple were on the way to their wedding reception in Buxton when they stopped at the Rawtenstall McDonald\u2019s for a feed.", "authors": ["Serena Coady"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88858138_1570511338.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
