Business growth depends on a strong free-enterprise system.\u201d \u2014 Sir John Templeton (quoted in \u201cThe Maxims of Wall Street,\u201d p. 137)\n\nThe great Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises (1881-1973) was once asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between socialism and capitalism?\u201d\n\nHe answered, \u201cThe stock market.\u201d Countries that adopt high levels of socialism and government intervention see their stock markets languish or even disappear.\n\nWhen communists take over a country, the first thing they do is shut down the stock market. When Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks took over Russia in 1917, they closed the St. Petersburg stock exchange and converted it into an art museum.\n\nThere is no stock market in Cuba or Venezuela.\n\nSimilarly, the countries that have nationalized their major industries soon see their stock markets disappear. For more than 50 years, the Buenos Aires Bolsa languished due to Juan Per\u00f3n and the Per\u00f3nist takeover of Argentina.\n\nArgentina was not able to create the Argentine stock index MERVAL until 1986. Even then, it underperformed the world markets until 2014.\n\nDemocratic Socialism Gains Support in the United States\n\nSince the financial collapse of 2008, the appeal of socialism has advanced in the West, including in the United States. Witness the Occupy Wall Street movement, the popularity of socialism on college campuses and the Democratic candidates for president supporting state intervention in the economy.\n\nHoward Schultz, the long-time CEO of Starbucks, considers himself a \u201cprogressive\u201d and has been a lifelong Democrat. However, he recently became so disgusted with the direction of the Democratic Party\u2019s move toward outright socialism that he left the party to consider running for the presidency as an Independent.\n\nHe\u2019s also not happy with the current crop of Democratic candidates, who are falling all over each other to see which one can promise more \u201cfree\u201d goodies from the government and more killer regulations that could destroy the American way of life.\n\nHe asked, \u201cWhen I hear them espousing free government-paid college, free government-paid health care and a free government job for everyone \u2014 on top of a $21 trillion debt \u2014 the question is, how are we paying for all this and not bankrupting the country?\u201d\n\nA Better Idea: Democratic Capitalism!\n\nYou can\u2019t get rid of a bad idea just by opposing it. You have to offer a better alternative.\n\nAnd that alternative is \u201cDemocratic Capitalism!\u201d\n\nDemocratic socialism is sharing the poverty. Democratic capitalism is sharing the wealth, not by confiscatory progressive taxation, but voluntarily through an enlightened stakeholder philosophy.\n\nJohn Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, calls it \u201cconscious capitalism\u201d and has stated that it is a capitalist philosophy that can benefit both workers and executives.\n\nThe Ford $5 a Day Story\n\nThe father of democratic capitalism is Henry Ford. In 1914, the Ford Motor Company had record profits from his Model T manufacturing plant in Highland Park, Michigan (right outside Detroit).\n\nFord made the dramatic announcement in January 1914 that he was more than doubling the wages of his workers to $5 a day. Investors and labor would benefit from the company\u2019s success. It was a revolutionary decision that made headlines around the country.\n\nThis week, I\u2019m in Michigan. Yesterday, I visited the original Ford plant where more than one million Model Ts were built yesterday. (See photo.) I wanted to pay homage to the man who changed the world in terms of labor-capital relations for the better. That is, Henry Ford destroyed the Marxist notion that capital and labor were enemies and that capitalism exploits the worker.\n\nMark Skousen stands in front of the site of the original Ford plant in Highland Park, Michigan.\n\nTonight, I\u2019m speaking at Hillsdale College on \u201cHow to Get Rid of a Bad Idea (Democratic Socialism): With a Better Idea \u2014 Democratic Capitalism!\u201d I\u2019ll have a full report on the reaction of the students in Monday\u2019s Forecasts and Strategies hotline.\n\nIf more companies provide incentives to workers through profit-sharing and stock options, democratic socialism will lose its appeal.\n\nLong live democratic capitalism!\n\nBy the way, if you\u2019re interested in what could be \u201cthe greatest private equity investment of all time,\u201d you\u2019re in luck.
