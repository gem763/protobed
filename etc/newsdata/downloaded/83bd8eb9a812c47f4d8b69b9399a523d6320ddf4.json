I would say it is a falsehood. I would say the judges are not politically swayed. I would say that's a falsehood\".\n\n\"The measure of commitment to Constitutional process and to the value of the Constitution and to truthfulness amongst judges in the High Court and judges in the appeal court is almost universal,\" he said.\n\nHe also said it was \"unfair and degrading\" to attack women judges. Instead, people should attack judgments based on the reasons given on a certain matter or the logic of the judgments.\n\n\"But don't attack a judge for being a woman or for having poor language skills. I think that is very degrading.\"\n\nALSO READ: 'Personal attacks on judges should be condemned', says Justice Minister Lamola\n\nCameron also admitted that there were good reasons for people to feel impatient and dissatisfied with the courts.\n\n\"We've got to get our judgments out quickly. We've got to be more responsive to people. I think especially in the magistrate's court, people feel there are too many postponements [and] justice is delayed.\"\n\nOn September 13, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng called on those who have evidence of captured or corrupt judges to provide concrete proof and to stop hiding behind fictional identities.\n\nHe said his office had asked national police commissioner General Khehla Sitole to use relevant capacities at his disposal to \"uncover the real forces behind the masks who are making apparently gratuitous allegations of corruption or capture against the judiciary\".", "description": "Retired Constitutional Court Justice Edwin Cameron says if any judge has ever taken money as alleged, he would be utterly amazed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9053/c3bea2eb5c4d4d0c8f934db29467cc25.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
