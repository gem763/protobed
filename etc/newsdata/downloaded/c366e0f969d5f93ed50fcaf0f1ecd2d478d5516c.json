Snow has blanketed the northern half of the country a few times before December. And if you live further south, there\u2019s a good chance that you have begun layering yourself with thicker, warmer clothes every morning.\n\nTo be clear, you don\u2019t get sick from going outside in the cold. You don\u2019t get sick from being cold. You don\u2019t get sick from not drying your hair.\n\nYou get sick from viruses. Sure, prolonged exposure to the cold can lower your immune system\u2019s ability to fight invading germs and viruses. But to truly protect yourself from getting the cold or flu, you must protect yourself from viruses. So let\u2019s review some prevention practices and also some healthy habits proven to strengthen your immune system.\n\nHow Viruses Spread and How to Stop Them\n\nOn the mirco level, viruses infiltrate and replicate inside the cells of healthy organisms. There are countless ways they can spread from organism to organism. Commonly, when infected people sneeze or cough, virus-infected droplets project several feet from their mouths. If you breathe the air shared by these droplets, there\u2019s a good chance that the virus entered your body.\n\nViruses also live on commonly touched things such as door handles, phones, hand towels, remote controls and more. They can spread viruses even days after they were originally contaminated.\n\nIn short, viruses are everywhere. And they move faster during cold and flu season because more people tend to stay indoors, in enclosed spaces, breathing recirculated air. Prevention is fairly simple, however, when practiced consistently and with the understanding of how viruses spread.\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nFor starters, cough into your elbow so that viruses aren\u2019t flying through the air or on your hands. When you cough into your hand or fist, you\u2019ll spread germs to everything you touch.\n\nIf you are infected, consider your face as a virus\u2019 ground zero. Runny noses, the area around your mouth, facial hair \u2013 all are virus bastions. Avoid touching your face when possible. (Actually avoid touching your face when you\u2019re not infected, too, to avoid bringing other people\u2019s germs to your mouth, nose, eyes, and ears.)\n\nOf course, you can\u2019t avoid touching everything (by the way, using a handkerchief to touch everything only spreads viruses more!) but you can thoroughly wash your hands for 20 seconds:\n\nBefore, during, and after preparing food\n\nBefore eating food\n\nBefore and after caring for someone who is sick\n\nBefore and after treating a cut or wound\n\nAfter using the toilet\n\nAfter changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet\n\nAfter blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing\n\nAfter touching an animal, animal feed, or animal waste\n\nAfter handling pet food or pet treats\n\nAfter touching garbage\n\nWater and soap work best, but if they aren\u2019t available in the moment, alcohol-based hand sanitizer is a fine substitute.\n\nThree More Power-Packed Prevention Methods\n\nTake a daily probiotic. Probiotics fight off cold and flu viruses on the bacterial level inside your body. They don\u2019t fight them blow-by-blow per se, but rather by boosting your immune system so that it\u2019s properly armed to fight off invading viruses and diseases. Look for a probiotic with at least 10 billion CFUs. Get more sleep with melatonin. Melatonin\u2019s natural ability to help you fall asleep and stay asleep is an underappreciated weapon against a cold or flu. While you sleep, your body rests and repairs itself. And when I say your body, I mean everything in your body \u2013 your muscles, your organs, your major systems, including your immune system. Sleeping better helps prevent sickness and it helps ward it off if you caught a virus already. I suggest you take 1-3 mg of melatonin 30 minutes before going to bed. Give yourself a multi-vitamin boost. Look for a high-quality multi-vitamin, especially one with antioxidants and vitamins C and D. Antioxidants and vitamin C are established cold fighters, but recent studies show that taking vitamin D reduces the risk of respiratory infections. That\u2019s critical during winter because we don\u2019t get nearly the amount of vitamin D from sunlight as we do in the summer.\n\nReferences\n\nAubrey, Allison. \u201cA Bit More Vitamin D Might Help Prevent Colds and Flu.\u201d NPR.
