The two recently got a marriage license, according to TMZ, but the outlet could not confirm they actually went through with it yet.\n\n\"I\u2019ve decided to retire & have my family. I know you guys are happy now. To my fans, keep reppin me, do it til da death of me,\" she said in a tweet on Thursday. \"X in the box- cuz ain\u2019t nobody checkin me. Love you for LIFE.\"\n\nI\u2019ve decided to retire & have my family. I know you guys are happy now.

Love you for LIFE ??\u2665??? \u2014 Mrs. Petty (@NICKIMINAJ) September 5, 2019\n\nIf Nicki's in fact done with the rap game ... she leaves behind a storied legacy. The pride of Trinidad and Tobago and Queens earlier this year became the first female rapper to officially sell 100 million units across her albums, singles and features as certified by the Recording Industry Association of America. Nicki's been nominated for 10 Grammys, earned a Guinness World Record in 2017 for most Billboard Hot 100 entries by a solo female artist and hauled in five MTV Video Music Awards. It's unclear if retirement means she's also done with the popular \"Queen Radio\" show. (TMZ)\n\nDJ Paul of Three 6 Mafia told TMZ he's hoping she is just taking a break, and that she will eventually come back, like so many other hip hop artists who \"retire\" but jump back on the scene later.", "description": "Rapper Nicki Minaj announced Thursday she is retiring to focus .09/06/2019 22:10:34PM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/251/4837fc07-3f93-4489-9be8-d0e21427ae80.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
