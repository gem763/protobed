Your dedication and the skills you imparted are still helpful.\n\nI can still see you stepping into our classroom that had broken window panes; I can still hear your voice and your emphasis on correct pronunciations and \u201cwoord orde\u201d.\n\nA robot cannot compete with you.\n\nThe second teacher is Matthews Sebidi, my standards 9 and 10 (grades 11 and 12) class teacher and Setswana teacher.\n\nWhen he was not at school or in the class, he was missed.\n\nThere is something about teachers who are good and dedicated at what they do, and that is: They are missed by their pupils.\n\nTeaching is not only about dishing out the subject matter, it is about how it is done.\n\nThe best teachers are often the ones who care the most deeply, not only about their jobs, but about every pupil they serve.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough just to love the subject matter: Great teachers share a love of pupils. Great teachers know how to communicate to enforce discipline.\n\nNo matter how good they may be, machines do not have the social and cognitive skills; they lack empathy to adequately support pupils and students.\n\nThis is what Sebidi did well without inflicting any pain on his pupils.\n\nI once responded to his request to construct a sentence using a particular verb and the whole class burst into laughter because of its pedestrian features.\n\nInstead of punishing me, Sebidi retorted \u201cthis one is playful and such cannot be admitted to a university\u201d.\n\nThat made me think deeply about my future.\n\nIt was a diplomatic way of bringing me in line in terms of what can be said and done in a teaching and learning environment and its implications for both the present and the future.\n\nTrue to his attribute of a great teacher, he knew what each pupil was capable individually and he strove to help them attain their personal best.\n\nBecause I had ambitions of going to university, I started taking my conduct in the classroom seriously.\n\nI passed my Setswana subject in matric very well, and obtained a distinction pass in my first year at the University of the North (Limpopo).\n\nI later learnt that it was that distinction pass in Setswana that got me admitted to the bachelor of education honours at the University of the Witwatersrand four years later.\n\nAt the time, historically white institutions were unable to measure the aptitude of black students as the matric examination they wrote under apartheid was viewed as not reliable enough to measure the academic potential of black students.\n\nThank you, Sebidi, for your hard work, discipline and diligence which opened doors for me in a system that was pitted against black people.\n\nYour quiet diplomacy and reprimand taught me a life lesson and shaped the path to who I am today.\n\nThat, a robot could not do.\n\nThe third teacher was Sello Lekotoko, my Standard 8 (Grade 10) class teacher.\n\nIn my first year at Khamane High School, he nominated me as one of nine pupils to represent the school at a youth convention in Mahikeng.\n\nI had no idea why I deserved this nomination. Upon our return from the convention we had to report back to the other pupils.\n\nFor the first time in my life I had to address a crowd of 300 pupils.\n\nThat took courage, confronting one\u2019s fears and learning to be accountable, some of the key elements of leadership.\n\nThroughout my high school and beyond, he took a keen interest in my growth and development.\n\nThank you, Lekotoko, a robot cannot match your insight, interest and nurturing.\n\nMy three teachers, now enjoying their retirement in Marapyane, are some of the unsung heroes of this nation.\n\nThey exhibited some of the attributes of great teachers: The ability to build caring relationships with pupils; excellent preparation and organisational skills; and a strong work ethic.\n\nWith little resources at their disposal they were able to inspire greatness and ambition and a sense of purpose in their pupils.\n\nGreat teachers touch the lives of their pupils in ways that shape their destinies and have a lifelong influence.\n\nNo matter how good they may be, machines do not have the social and cognitive skills; they lack empathy to adequately support pupils and students.\n\nJob roles that involve recognising cultural sensitivities and caring for others, as well as cultivating creative or complex reasoning and perception are unlikely to be automated.\n\nTeachers, you can relax, your jobs are safe. You will never be replaced by robots anytime soon.\n\nA word of advice: Do not stop learning and improving your knowledge and skills. Find ways to embrace the use of technology in your teaching.\n\nAs Henry Adams said: \u201cGood teachers affect eternity; they can never tell where their influence stops.\u201d\n\nSehoole is professor and dean of the faculty of education at the University of Pretoria\n\nTALK TO US Which teacher inspired you to become the person you are today?
