REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - British finance minister Sajid Javid will promise on Thursday to launch \u201ca decade of renewal\u201d for the country\u2019s economy as he prepares to increase public investment after years of tight control on government spending.\n\nJavid will make his comments to other finance chiefs at a planned gathering of International Monetary Fund member countries in Washington on Thursday, Britain\u2019s finance ministry said.\n\nJavid, who became finance minister in July, is working on new fiscal rules to be announced along with his first budget plan which is due on Nov. 6, if Britain can avoid a no-deal Brexit before then.\n\nLast month he announced the biggest rise in day-to-day public spending in 15 years in a one-year expenditure plan which was widely seen as paving the way for an early election.\n\nJavid has previously said his budget will focus on improving infrastructure.\n\nThe ministry said Javid would also support calls made by the IMF earlier this week for countries to invest in long-term growth and he was determined to take advantage of record-low borrowing costs for productive investment.\n\nJavid was also due to say that getting Brexit done would unlock corporate investment, which has fallen due to uncertainty about Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, and that the country would remain an open economy.", "description": "British finance minister Sajid Javid will promise on Thursday to launch \"a decade of renewal\" for the country's economy as he prepares to increase public investment after years of tight control on government spending.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441655859&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F21S", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
