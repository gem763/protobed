The judge claimed the ban may force adults to return to smoking more harmful tobacco products and has irreparably hurt vaping businesses.\n\nGovernor Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement that she would be appealing the decision, calling the judge's ruling \"wrong.\"\n\n\"It misreads the law and sets a dangerous precedent of a court second-guessing the expert judgment of public health officials dealing with a crisis,\" Whitmer said. \"I plan to seek an immediate stay and go directly to the Supreme Court to request a quick and final ruling.\"\n\nSeveral states have taken steps to ban the sale of flavored vaping products amid a rising number of vaping-related lung illnesses and an epidemic of teen e-cigarette use. As of last week, vaping-related illnesses in the U.S. had reached about 1,300 cases, including at least 26 deaths.\n\nMost who got sick said they vaped products containing THC, the marijuana ingredient that causes a high, but some said they vaped only nicotine.\n\nIn New York, a state appeals court this month preliminarily blocked the state from enforcing a ban on flavored e-cigarette sales.\n\nThe Michigan lawsuits, which were consolidated, were filed by Houghton-based 906 Vapor and A Clean Cigarette, which has 15 locations across the state.", "description": "The judge said the ban may force adults to return to smoking more harmful tobacco products and has irreparably hurt vaping businesses", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/06/2add800f-a543-45af-99ca-6cd80ac59a26/thumbnail/1200x630/6a5a7226810f09c14e3ef74f1b2e5970/ap-19226695071917.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
