According to the National Center for Education Statistics, just 41% of first-time full-time college students earn a bachelor's degree in four years, and 59% earn a bachelor's in six years. Among low-income students who receive Pell Grants, four and six-year graduation rates are even lower.\n\nTaking longer than the standard four years to graduate can drive up the cost of attending college significantly, and many of these students are ultimately left with the debt of a college education without the degree.\n\nHowever, the top ranked schools on U.S. News' list graduate the vast majority of students within six years, helping students minimize the cost \u2014 and maximize the benefits \u2014 of college. Here are the top five U.S. universities of 2020, according to U.S. News:", "description": "U.S. News analyzed data from nearly 1,400 schools and found that top ranking schools share one thing in common: they excel at graduating students on time.", "authors": ["Abigail Hess"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105439114-1536343150976princeton.jpg?v=1536343242", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
