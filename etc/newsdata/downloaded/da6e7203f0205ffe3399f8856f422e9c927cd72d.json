Everything stops for not only me but my husband as well.\n\n'You don't actually believe it, even up to now, you don't. Although you've been given the information, you've processed the information but your feelings don't allow you to accept it.'\n\nArathi Nehar, 43, is pictured with her husband Jaswinder Singh and their sons Sanjay, 10 (left), and Pawanveer, 23 months (right) who were both killed in a horror crash in Wolverhampton\n\nMrs Nehar was told her boys had died by police officers after going for urgent scans on her broken coccyx and fractured upper back.\n\nShe recalled how it was 'just a normal Thursday night' when she set off with her boys to get fish and chips.\n\nShe said: 'You don't actually believe it, even up to now, you don't. Although you've been given the information, you've processed the information but your feelings don't allow you to accept it. We wouldn't want this to happen to anyone else.'\n\nMrs Nehar and her husband Jaswinder Singh say 'lessons need to be learned' following the tragedy. A police investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing.\n\nMrs Nehar was told her boys (pictured) had died by police officers after going for urgent scans on her broken coccyx and fractured upper back\n\nThe investigation has focused on two cars - an Audi, which was in collision with the family car, and a Bentley. Detectives are seeking to examine whether either were speeding.\n\nThe family say they have faith in the police and they await for the investigation to run its course.\n\nArathi's cousin Rikki Nehar, 47, said: 'There's nothing we can do that is going to change what's happened but lessons needs to be learned.\n\n'These accidents are continuing to happen. That's the main objective now, to learn lessons from this.'\n\nShe added: 'It's tougher sentences. I don't think the roads being made safer is going to make any impact.\n\n'You're always going to get your rogue element that is going to cross the line. Tougher sentences may deter people.'\n\nSanjay was a pupil at Cotwall End Primary School in Sedgley and was described as kind and caring by his mother, and protective of his younger brother who was only days away from his second birthday when he died.\n\nTheir mother, also of Sedgley, is still on leave from her job as a services administrator for a care company and says she has been existing day to day since tragedy struck in March.\n\nSanjay was just over a year away from starting secondary school. His mother describes him as loving and cheeky.\n\nHe supported Liverpool and Arathi remembers with a smile how he liked designer clothes and would steal his father's aftershave.\n\nHe was especially protective of Pawanveer and would tell all his school friends at Cotwall End Primary School in Sedgley about how he adored his younger brother.\n\n'Sanjay had a very kind and caring personality. He was a very popular child, he was very confident. Then I had Pawanveer eight years later and Sanjay took really well to Pav,' she added\n\n'He loved being an older brother, he took on the caring role with him so Pav and Sanjay had their own relationship which was beautiful and they had this very strong bond.\n\n'Sanjay and me, we were very close. He wasn't a typical 10-year-old, he was very charismatic, he did the housework. Boys would tend to go a different way but he was domesticated, he loved looking after his own bedroom.\n\n'As he started to get older he was very much aware of designer wear, using his dad's aftershave and things like that. He was very caring to the children at school and a lot of that was told to me after the children did pass.\n\n'He was very protective (of Pawanveer) and kind of showed him off as well at the same time and spoke highly of his younger brother.\n\n'The four of us had a very strong relationship between us and the boys were very much loved and cared for.'\n\nRecalling the beginning of the day that would change their lives forever, she added: 'It was just a normal day.\n\n'I was at work. I came back from work and we just decided to get some tea for ourselves.\n\n'We were minding our own business, a typical Thursday evening for us, I've done it a million times. A normal day, even up to the point where I'm at the traffic lights.\n\n'I remember waiting to turn onto Lawnswood Avenue, the next bit what I remember was seeing the ambulances, the crew and everyone.\n\n'The first thing I remember is the high-visible jackets, I remember them very clearly on the night.'\n\nHer vision of the aftermath remains hazy but has been told how, despite her traumatic injuries, she screamed out for her boys, desperate to see if they were okay.\n\nSpeaking of the earth-shattering moment she found out what had happened, she continued: 'I went in for assessment and my scans, then the doctor came and told me about my injuries and my care that I was going to receive.\n\n'Then shortly after it was the police officer that came to my bed and brought my family with them and that's when I was informed.'\n\nThe mother's injuries were so serious doctors were surprised she survived.\n\n'They were looking at three fatalities. Although I was conscious when they got to me they didn't really know if I was going to survive, she said.\n\nAsked whether she ever questions why she survived and her sons did not, she replied: 'All the time - it's here at the front of your mind every day. You go to bed, it's there and I think it will be for the rest of my life.\n\n'You're positive for a couple of days then something sets you right back. I've got to work at getting myself back to how I was, the woman before the accident, still I can't say how or when.'\n\nMrs Nehar says she understands the police investigation will take time but hopes someone will be punished over the deaths of Sanjay and Pawanveer.\n\nShe said: 'It makes me physically sick. It just makes me feel nervous, I've lost confidence.\n\n'I've not given them (the drivers of the other cars) any time. I'm going to let the police do their work and I'm not giving them any thought.\n\n'I've not wanted to go out. I've had a lot of support from my direct family and without them I don't know if I would be here today.'\n\nA sea of flowers, cards, balloons and other tributes lined the road where the boys were killed following the crash.\n\nHundreds turned out for their funerals, while a memorial garden had been opened at Cotwall End Primary School in the boys' honour.\n\nArathi said: 'The amount of cards, flowers that were coming into the house. For Pawanveer's birthday on March 23 that was the first time I went out and visited the scene.\n\n'Although it was traumatic when I saw the messages from the children, families, the community it almost lifted me. I was glad I was there.\n\n'It was Pawanveer's birthday and there was no way I was not going to return on that day.\n\n'When I saw the messages about Sanjay I felt positive about how other people saw him. Your own children are always special to you. The children who hadn't even met Pawanveer knew about him because that's how much Sanjay talked about him.\n\n'Pawanveer was just adorable. People saw him once and remembered him, he was jut and adorable baby.\n\n'Sanjay taught him everything, the PlayStation and the floss. Sanjay thought we was the best flosser that was ever born.\n\n'They're both beautiful boys and I was lucky to have the 10 years with Sanjay, the 23 months with Pawanveer.\n\n'They'll always be missed and they'll be loved forever. Nothing's ever going to be the same for us again.'", "description": "Arathi Nehar, 43, battled for her life after suffering a broken spine in the crash in Wolverhampton on the evening of March 14.
