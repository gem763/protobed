The rally offered a pointed reminder to skeptics in both political parties that the 78-year-old democratic socialist is still very much a force in the 2020 presidential race.\n\nSanders opened his remarks by apologizing that he secured a permit for only 20,000 people. His campaign, he said, was forced to close the gates on many more people who were trying to enter the Queens park just across the river from Manhattan.\n\n\u201cTo put it bluntly, I am back,\u201d Sanders declared, sparking chants of, \u201cBernie is back\u201d from the massive crowd.\n\n\u201cI am happy to report to you that I am more than ready \u2014 more ready than ever \u2014 to carry on with you on the epic struggle that we face today,\u201d he added. \u201cI am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe event marked Sanders\u2019 formal return to the campaign trail less than three weeks after he suffered a heart attack that threatened both his life and political future. Even before that, he was in danger of falling out of the top-tier in the 2020 Democratic primary field. Polls suggest he\u2019s lagging behind liberal rival Elizabeth Warren and establishment favorite Joe Biden.\n\nBut the fiery Brooklyn native, backed by a slate of new endorsements and two new stents in an artery connected to his heart, appeared to be expanding his coalition on Saturday.\n\nA security company hired by the campaign reported a crowd estimate of 25,000. Among those speaking, filmmaker and activist Michael Moore told the cheering crowd that he was endorsing Sanders, shortly before Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., praised the Vermont senator on stage.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders fought for me,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said as she introduced Sanders.\n\nShe heaped praise on the Vermont senator but did not explicitly say that she was endorsing him. The Sanders campaign announced earlier in the week that she had.\n\nBefore the rally, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said endorsements this past week from Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., in particular were proof that the Sanders campaign is growing. He predicted that they would especially help Sanders strengthen his support among young, minority voters.\n\n\u201cThose are two people who I think have immense power to mobilize young people, and I promise you you\u2019ll be seeing them in Iowa, but not only in Iowa, but around the country, trying to get people engaged around the issues,\u201d Shakir said.\n\nFor now, at least, Sanders can use the help.\n\nWhile he insists he\u2019s ready to move forward, he\u2019s doing so cautiously. Saturday\u2019s rally was his only scheduled appearance before he returns to Iowa late in the coming week.\n\nThe week after, he\u2019ll join Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., for a tour of her congressional district. Tlaib hasn\u2019t announced whether she\u2019ll endorse Sanders, but she is part of the same small \u201csquad\u201d of minority women on Capitol Hill who gave been a target of President Donald Trump.\n\nDespite the aggressive rhetoric from Sanders himself, senior adviser Jeff Weaver said Sanders would ease himself back onto the campaign trail. But by December, he predicted, Sanders health scare will be forgotten.\n\nAlmost all the speakers during Saturday\u2019s event, which spanned several hours on a sunny, crisp fall afternoon, played down the health concerns.\n\n\u201cThe only heart attack we should be talking about is the one Wall Street is going to have when Bernie Sanders is president,\u201d said Moore, the filmmaker.\n\nNina Turner, one of Sanders\u2019 national co-chairs, said it \u201cboggles my mind\u201d that Sanders\u2019 critics have embraced \u201cageism.\u201d\n\n\u201cLife happens to us all,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMemo to the haters: hashtag Bernie Is Back,\u201d she added. \u201cWe never went anywhere, we just pushed pause for a minute.\u201d", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Storming past questions about his health, Bernie Sanders vowed that he's \"more ready than ever\" to fight for a political revolution \u2014 with", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/19/9ea562_election-2020-bernie-sanders-43753-democratic-presidential-candidate-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
