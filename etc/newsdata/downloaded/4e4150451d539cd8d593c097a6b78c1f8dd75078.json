From a business perspective, the controversy certainly isn\u2019t worth the small part of our business they make up. But political ads are an important part of voice \u2014 especially for local candidates, up-and-coming challengers, and advocacy groups that may not get much media attention otherwise.\n\nThroughout the speech, Zuckerberg couched Facebook\u2019s policies as the result of moral choices rather than business decisions. \u201cBanning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media covers,\u201d he said, noting the solution is to monitor who is posting the content rather than the content itself. \u201cYou can still say controversial things,\u201d he added, \u201cbut you have to stand behind them with your real identity and face accountability.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s comments come at a time when Facebook is under fire for helping spread misinformation and is being investigated by the Justice Department and 40 state attorneys general for possible antitrust violations. Politicians from Josh Hawley (R-MO) to Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) are calling for the company to be broken up.\n\nWarren has been on the forefront of calling out the company\u2019s permissive ad policies, which she says have turned the company into a \u201cdisinformation-for-profit machine.\u201d After Facebook modified its policy to exempt political ads from fact-checking, she ran an ad falsely claiming that Zuckerberg had endorsed Trump to illustrate her point.\n\nTo Zuckerberg, the fallout from Warren is the cost of defending free expression. \u201cI don\u2019t think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100 percent true.\u201d he said. \u201cI believe we should err on the side of greater expression.\u201d", "description": "Facebook\u2019s CEO Mark Zuckerberg rallied people around the First Amendment during a live speech at Georgetown University.
