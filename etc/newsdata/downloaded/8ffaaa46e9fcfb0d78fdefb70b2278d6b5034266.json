The question is will the telecommunications powerhouse keep up its impressive run amid a changing consumer landscape that has seen more pay-TV customers defect in favor of streaming TV services such as Netflix (NASDAQ: ) .\n\nAT&T\u2019s Pitch & Problems\n\nAT&T completed its $80 billion-plus acquisition of Time Warner (now called WarnerMedia) last summer in a move meant to bolster and broaden the telecom giant\u2019s portfolio amid changing consumer habits. The Time Warner deal brought HBO, Turner, Warner Bros, and cable channels such as CNN under AT&T\u2019s umbrella.\n\nThe company is projected to roll out its challenge to Netflix, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Prime, Apple (NASDAQ: ) , Disney (NYSE: ) , and others in the spring of 2020.HBO Max should help AT&T compete in a streaming TV era that is just starting to heat up.\n\nThe firm also said last quarter that it planned to begin trials of its new \u201cthin client video service\u201d channel package called AT&T TV during the third quarter.\n\nInvestors also want to see the firm adapt to other challenges. This includes activist investor Elliott Management\u2019s early September push for AT&T management to move on from non-essential assets. AT&T executives had already started to divest, which included selling its stake in Hulu, in order to help pay for its WarnerMedia deal.\n\nLast week, AT&T announced that it agreed to sell its Puerto Rican and U.S. Virgin Islands operations to Liberty Latin America Ltd. (NASDAQ: ) for $1.95 billion in cash. The firm noted that the new deal brought its \u201ccompleted or announced monetization efforts this year\" to more than $11 billion. AT&T management also said that they expect the firm to return to repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter, along with further debt reduction.\n\nAT&T\u2019s plans to continue to pay down debt might also help ease nerves on Wall Street regarding its continued loss of TV users. Last quarter, the firm, which owns U-Verse cable and DirecTV, lost 778,000 \u201cpremium TV subscribers\u201d and 168,000 \u201cDirecTV NOW subscribers.\u201d\n\nComcast (NASDAQ: ) and other cable giants have also lost TV users. Luckily, AT&T\u2019s wireless business continued to add customers as it competes against Verizon (NYSE: ) .\n\nQ3 Outlook & Earnings Trends\n\nMoving on, our current Zacks Consensus Estimates call for AT&T\u2019s Q3 revenue to slip 1.2% to $45.18 billion. The firm\u2019s fourth-quarter sales are expected to fall at a similar rate, with full-year fiscal 2019 revenue still projected to surge 6.8% to $182.40 billion. Peeking a bit further down the road, the company\u2019s 2020 sales are expected to pop 0.42% above our current-year estimate to come in at $183.16 billion.\n\nAt the bottom end of the income statement, T\u2019s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to climb 3.33% to reach $0.93 per share. AT&T\u2019s Q4 EPS figure is then projected to pop 3.5% to help lift full-year earnings by 1.1%. The telecom firm\u2019s adjusted FY20 earnings are expected to jump 2.4% higher than our 2019 estimate.\n\nAT&T has a relatively solid history of quarterly earnings beats, but investors should note that the company\u2019s earnings estimate revisions have trended more heavily in the wrong direction recently.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAT&T is Zacks Ranks #3 (Hold) at the moment that sports an \u201cA\u201d grade for Value in our Style Scores system. The stock is trading below its industry\u2019s average and its own five-year median when it comes to forward 12-month Zacks earnings estimates.\n\nThe company also pays an annualized dividend of $2.04 per share. This helps T boast an impressive 5.43% yield, which comes in way above the 10-year U.S. Treasury note\u2019s 1.73%.\n\nAT&T\u2019s solid valuation picture and strong dividend yield will likely keep most investors around no matter what happens when the firm reports its Q3 fiscal 2019 financial results on October 28. However, T stock rests just below its 52-week highs, which could put added pressure on the firm to post stronger-than-expected quarterly results.\n\nIn the end, though, Wall Street might focus more on AT&T\u2019s streaming future and updates on what it plans to do with assets such as DirecTV.\n\nBreakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit Potential\n\n\n\nThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond $775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases. They\u2019re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases.\n\n\n\nZacks has just released Century of Biology: 7 Biotech Stocks to Buy Right Now to help investors profit from 7 stocks poised for outperformance.
