Then I saw my son, daughter, and wife and I deleted it.\u201d\n\nI was about to push the button on a really snarky tweet.

They were a tabloid fixture in those days, thanks in part to the fact that she is 15 years older than he is.\n\n\u201cI think part of it is, we\u2019ve been conditioned societally to look at the value of a woman being tied to her fertility,\u201d Moore said during a \u201cGood Morning America\u201d interview with Diane Sawyer on Wednesday. \u201cLike, what would an older woman have to offer?\u201d\n\nDuring the same interview, Moore also admitted that she felt she \u201clost\u201d a sense of her self while she was with Kutcher.\n\nChristian JENTZ via Getty Images Kutcher and Demi Moore at the Los Angeles premiere of \"No Strings Attached\" in 2011.\n\nMoore told Ellen DeGeneres on Tuesday that she felt she \u201ccreated an addiction\u201d to her famous ex and engaged in threesomes to \u201cplease\u201d him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it should be implied that he instigated,\u201d Moore told DeGeneres in regards to the group sex. \u201cI think it was \u2014 and again in trying to keep the perspective on my story \u2014 he expressed something that was of a fantasy and it was in my efforts to want to please and be what I thought he wanted.\u201d\n\nIn regards to the couple\u2019s eventual split, Moore told Sawyer that she discovered Kutcher had been cheating on her when she received a Google alert about his infidelity. She said she sent the alert to Kutcher, asking him if it was true, and \u201che admitted it right away.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think my response was, \u2018Are you fucking kidding me?\u2019\u201d Moore added with a laugh.", "description": "Moore has been spilling a lot of tea about ex-husband Kutcher on the press tour for her new memoir, \u201cInside Out.\u201d", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8bc5d0220000e601516957.jpeg?cache=bpsjkby0jg&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
