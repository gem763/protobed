However, researchers in China have found a rather unexpected effect that the high level of air pollution had on the growth of trees.\n\ngoodfreephotos\n\nA study that was published in the journal Global Change Biology found that the trees actually grew faster and stronger when the smog was the thickest. To conduct this field research, the researchers tracked the growth of six aspen trees from 2012 to 2015, when Beijing recorded the highest levels of pollution.\n\nIt may seem bizarre to us but Wang Xin, a doctoral student, claims that the results of the study didn't come across as strange to experts who study plant growth.\n\nUnsplash\n\nDon't Miss 46.1 K SHARES 1 K SHARES 2.1 K SHARES\n\n\u201cAerosol particles can increase the efficiency of photosynthesis by diffusing light, as observations over the past 30 years have showed,\u201d he said.\n\nAerosols are essentially particles that are floating in the air. These include soot, dust and sulphates which are produced due to the burning of coal, wood or gas. These particles are extremely harmful to human health but in plants, it helps the process of photosynthesis.\n\nUnsplash\n\nHowever, don't mistake this for a necessarily positive effect. Liu Lingli, the study\u2019s lead researcher said:\n\n\u201cThis is because trees that absorb major greenhouse gas carbon dioxide will grow slower than they did once the aerosol concentration decreases.\u201d\n\nUnsplash\n\nTalking about this effect of pollution on the growth of trees, Lingli said:\n\n\u201cIt suggests an even more challenging task in coping with climate change while fighting against air pollution in the future.\"\n\nAccording to Liu, this means that countries that have high levels of PM2.5 (the small particles in the atmosphere which are the most harmful to human health) should reduce their carbon footprint in order to compensate for this effect.", "description": "We've always associated Beijing with bad air pollution, before Delhi happened, that is.
