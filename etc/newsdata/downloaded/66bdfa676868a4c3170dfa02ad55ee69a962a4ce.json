Anna Brockway, co-founder of online antiques market Chairish, noted, \u201cIn 2018 we saw 40% growth in the category. Shoppers were going absolutely nuts for them.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s certainly no shortage of style options\u2014from earthy rattan to midcentury teak to brass-appointed acrylic. Austin Handler, who runs design firm Mabley Handler in Water Mill, N.Y., with his wife, installed a cart, a modern take on Hollywood Regency, in his mother\u2019s small Cape Cod house in nearby Sag Harbor. The polished-nickel cart makes a statement among the Hamptons\u2019 blue-and-ivory d\u00e9cor, he said. \u201cYou can put a mirror or piece of art above one, so it gives you two opportunities to bring style to a room.\u201d In a Palm Beach, Fla. project, designer Betsy Wentz used a cart to bridge the formal feel of a cypress-panelled library with a minimalist white pool deck. The cart\u2019s \u201cboardwalk gray\u201d painted wood was beachy, its hexagonal shape, glamorous.\n\nSome design pros believe the appeal of these trolleys goes beyond their photogenic, \u201ctablescaped\u201d tiers. \u201cPractically speaking, a bar cart allows you to keep all your cocktail-making kit together. Not just your spirits, liqueurs and mixers but stirrers, jiggers, coasters, things you might otherwise have to dig around for in kitchen drawers,\u201d said Emily Henson, a London interior stylist and author of \u201cBar Cart Style\u201d (Ryland Peters & Small), out next month. Equally valuable, said Ms. Henson, \u201cMixing a cocktail at a beautifully presented bar cart elevates a simple evening of drinks with friends to a memorable event, a ritual to be savored.\u201d\n\nNO\n\nINITIALLY seduced by a glittery bar cart, Grace Rosenstein jettisoned it from her design scheme when she and her husband moved from Manhattan to Connecticut. She is, in short, not a fan. \u201cThe bottles and glassware collect dust and dirt, and when the bar cart is fully arranged, there\u2019s little space\u2014if any\u2014to actually mix a drink, so they become sticky,\u201d said the designer. Her fantasy alternative: a butler\u2019s pantry, one of those little be-sinked areas off grand kitchens. But since the closest most of us get to butler-anything is streaming \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d the bar cabinet is the solution. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like creating your own mini butler pantry.\u201d\n\nNew York designer Mark Curley not only refutes bar carts\u2019 utility\u2014\u201cEveryone mixes their drinks in the kitchen, even if they have a wet bar\u201d\u2014he believes they telegraph crassness more than sophistication. \u201cBar carts say, \u2018Hi this is my living room brought to you by Johnnie Walker,\u2019\u201d he said. Mr. Curley prefers using the trolleys as furniture, especially end tables. \u201cAs sofas keep getting bigger, bar carts, adorned with wheels and strong structural elements, can certainly hold their own against them.\u201d\n\nMr. Handler and his wife also appreciate the discretion of bar cabinets. In fact, as part of their furniture collection with Kravet, the two designed a version clad in blue grass cloth overlaid with cerused-oak lattice. Speaking proudly of their design and of bar cabinets in general, Mr. Handler said that when access to the liquor isn\u2019t needed, \u201cyou get to close it off and look at a beautiful piece of furniture.\u201d\n\nHigh Rollers\n\nFour servers in which to hold your liquor in style\n\n1.
