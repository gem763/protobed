But this year, Walford bosses are actively teasing the scintillating prospect after the superbitch\u2019s solicitors sent a letter to the Slaters informing them of her plans to sell the house.\n\nJanine currently owns the house that the Slaters live in and we saw Mo Harris (Laila Morse) look troubled as she opened a letter informing them that they would have to vacate their home as she is selling up.\n\nWith so much going on for the clan \u2013 from Jean\u2019s (Gillian Wright) cancer battle to Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner) going into hiding \u2013 a big move is the last thing they need. So will they be prepared to make Janine\u2019s eviction of them as difficult as possible? And will this bring Janine back to the Square to do her dirty work herself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCentral to many a huge story \u2013 which often included her conning, scamming, scheming, cheating or even killing (RIP Barry) \u2013 Janine has long been on viewers\u2019 wish list of returns. And given that show bosses have recently tempted back iconic legends such as Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite), Sean Slater (Rob Kazinsky), Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin) and Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer), could now be the right time?\n\nThere is no word either way on whether Janine will step onto the Square again but Charlie has never ruled out a comeback when asked about it in the past. And fans are speculating that the letter is the sign that a return plot is underway.\n\nWill EastEnders give us the Christmas gift we all deserve?\n\nEither way, it already promises to be a festive season to remember as the Slaters aren\u2019t the only family set to be ripped apart. The Mitchells are going to be utterly demolished when the truth about Sharon\u2019s (Letitia Dean) affair with Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters) is exposed.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "She has some bad news for the family.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/janine-eastenders-9ab5_1571821808.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
