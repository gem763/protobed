They are discussing today whether to grant Britain a short or long extension - with a decision expected tomorrow. They are also considering whether they need to convene a special summit in Brussels to do this, or the 27 EU leaders can reach a consensus remotely. If leaders agree a short extension of a few days or weeks, Boris Johnson could try to get his deal over the line and agree a new timetable to get Brexit done. If they agree an extension until January 31 or beyond, Number 10 says it will pull the Bill and challenge Jeremy Corbyn to an election. It is thought this would be held before Christmas, with the last feasible date to hold a vote being December 12. After that civil servants have warned that schools will have to cancel nativity plays and other Christmas events to act as polling stations. It means that how the EU decides to act are crucial in how the future of Brexit and a general election plays out.\n\nIt came amid reported splits within Mr Johnson's Cabinet over whether to use the so-called Brextension of three months for a general election or a second attempt to get his Withdrawal Agreement Bill (Wab) through Parliament.\n\nIt is thought the Prime Minister will lay down the gauntlet to Jeremy Corbyn as soon as the EU grant another Brexit extension, a decision expected tomorrow.\n\nMr Johnson could put forward a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act as early as tonight, according to The Times, leading to a potential election on December 5.\n\nBut Mr Johnson is facing mounting Tory resistance, with some believing his chief adviser Dominic Cummings is driving him towards the polls, whereas the PM might be more inclined to plough on with Brexit.\n\nAnd Jeremy Corbyn is still dithering over whether to back a pre-Christmas election \u2013 as Labour MPs warned him the party would get 'smashed' at the polls.\n\nMr Corbyn, who turned down the chance of an election three times last month, claimed this month he was 'champing at the bit' to go to the polls as soon as a fresh Brexit delay was in place.\n\nBut yesterday his spokesman refused to say if Labour would vote for an election next week, even if Brexit has been delayed until the end of January, which rules out the risk of an immediate No Deal.\n\nAnd sources said more than half of Labour MPs had told the party's whips they would not vote for an election now, even if Mr Corbyn ordered them to.\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron is leading a group of rebels who want a Brexit extension of as little as 15 days after Boris Johnson was forced by MPs to hand control to Brussels\n\nOne shadow Cabinet minister told MailOnline: 'It is awful. He could try, but he probably won't have the numbers to get it over the line anyway. It just doesn't stack up.'\n\n'We could be stuffed like Christmas turkeys': Tory MPs warn Boris Johnson over his 'Grinch-like' bid for a December election Boris Johnson has been warned that the Tories could be 'stuffed like Christmas turkeys' if he insists on holding an election this year before Brexit has been delivered. The Prime Minister and Jeremy Corbyn are both battling rebellions within their own parties today as they sought to win enough backing for a snap general election. It came as all eyes in Westminster are focused on the EU. Leaders are set to reveal tomorrow if they have agreed the length of a Brexit delay, or whether an emergency summit will be needed on Monday to hammer out the details. Many Tory MPs fear that the party could lose seats in Scotland and London if a vote is held now, because of strong support for Remain in those areas as Mr Johnson pushes for Brexit. Some Tory backbenchers are deeply sceptical that the Conservatives will be able to win a majority at a snap poll \u2013 a point they have conveyed to Number 10. And many of Mr Corbyn's MPs are set to vote against any move to support Mr Johnson's wish, fearing an electoral disaster.\n\nThe shadow minister predicted that the leadership will wait till the last possible moment and hope events save them from having to make a decision.\n\n'In principle an Opposition should always be wanting to face the electorate. That is pretty much our only reason for being.\n\n'But a lot of people are scared of what will happen. Splitting the party that badly would be the nightmare.\n\n'What is our excuse for not wanting an election? Once we have the extension, what are we going to say?'\n\nShadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey was asked this morning if Labour would vote for a general election as soon as the Prime Minister asks for one after the EU grants an extension.\n\nShe told the Today programme: 'That's our position. But we also want the Prime Minister to look at the compromise that's been offered that a lot of MPs support, and that's the ability to be able to properly scrutinise the Bill.'\n\nMr Cummings, Mr Johnson's chief adviser, is reportedly leading calls to abandon attempts to get the Prime Minister's Brexit deal through Parliament and go for an election.\n\nBut Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith is said to be among ministers arguing it is still possible to pass a bill ratifying the agreement, despite Tuesday's defeat for Mr Johnson's attempt to fast-track it through the Commons.\n\nThere are fears among Conservatives that if there is an election before the UK has left the EU, it will play into the hands of Nigel Farage's Brexit Party.\n\nEven if Mr Johnson does decide to press for an early election there is no guarantee that he will succeed.\n\nUnder the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act he would need a 'super majority' of two-thirds of all MPs to call an election which would require Labour support.\n\nJeremy Corbyn is dithering over whether to back a pre-Christmas election \u2013 as Labour MPs warned him the party would get 'smashed' at the polls.\n\nMr Cummings (pictured today) reportedly banging his fist in fury during a meeting between Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn when the PM suggested a compromise to the Brexit timetable\n\nPM blasted for pulling out of grilling by senior MPs for the third time The Prime Minister's decision to pull out of an appearance before senior MPs with less than 24 hours' notice has been described as 'extraordinary'. Boris Johnson had been due to face questioning by the Commons Liaison Committee - made up of select committee chairmen - on Thursday. But in a handwritten note to the chairwoman, Sarah Wollaston, he asked for a new date to be arranged for 'five or six months' on from when he became Prime Minister. Dr Wollaston said the public would have to 'draw their own conclusions' on whether he refused because he is running scared. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'He knows that he's been Prime Minister for months now, he's only had two appearances at Prime Minister's Questions, and again not facing this kind of detailed scrutiny, I don't think it's good enough, really.'\n\nTory Party chairman James Cleverly kept his options this morning, saying it was still possible to leave on October 31, without revealing how.\n\nHe told the Today Programme: 'We've been calling for a general election, me personally, the Prime Minister at the ballot box, my friends and colleagues all around the country, for months now.\n\n'The Labour Party are running scared and I can completely understand why, their Brexit message is confused at best.'\n\nHe added that the Government has had to 'ramp up' its no-deal preparations because 'the EU has not agreed an extension and therefore it is absolutely essential that we make sure that we are ready to leave'.\n\nMr Cummings reportedly banging his fist in fury during a meeting between Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn when the PM suggested a compromise to the Brexit timetable.\n\nAfter Labour blocked Mr Johnson's fast-track Brexit timetable on Tuesday night, it was alleged that Mr Johnson had asked Mr Corbyn how long it might take to get the deal passed, at which point, according to The Telegraph, Mr Cummings furiously shouted, 'No!'\n\nNo10 doused the claims as 'utter nonsense' and added that the meeting with the Opposition leader was 'a total waste of time.'", "description": "French president Emmanuel Macron is leading a group of rebels who want a Brexit extension of as little as 15 days after Boris Johnson was forced by MPs to hand control to Brussels.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent", "James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline", "David Churchill Brussels Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/09/20121956-0-image-a-17_1571906155234.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
