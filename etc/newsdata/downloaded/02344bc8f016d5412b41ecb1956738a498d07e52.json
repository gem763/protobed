After Paul Goldschmidt was intentionally walked, Wong advanced to third on Marcell Ozuna's forceout. Then it was Molina time. The 37-year old hit a deep fly ball to left that scored Wong to end the game in walk-off fashion.\n\nThis time it was the Cardinals who got the last laugh in front of a frenzied home crowd at Busch Stadium, unlike in Game 4 when the Braves rallied for three runs in the ninth inning.\n\nHere's a look at how the game was won:\n\nYadier Molina celebrates with first base coach Stubby Clapp after hitting an RBI single in the eighth inning.

Molina, the heart-and-soul of the Cardinals, hit a game-tying single in the eighth inning and won Game 4 with a sacrifice fly in the 10th inning.\n\n\"Did it behind the plate today. Helped navigate the relievers through it. Did a nice job with Dak, who I thought did a nice job as well.\" said Cardinals manager Mike Shildt. \"But that's what makes you an elite, special player, that's what he is.\"\n\nShort rest\n\nBraves manager Brian Snitker waited until Monday morning to announce their Game 4 starter. Snitker opted for Dallas Keuchel, who started on short rest.\n\n\"I know it's a day short, but he didn't have an extended, just a grueling outing in his first one either,\" Snitker said. \"So that's why we feel really good about him going out there.\"\n\nThe move almost backfired from the get-go. The Cardinals hit back-to-back homers off Keuchel in the first inning and added a third in the fourth inning. It was the 11th time Keuchel had allowed three homers in a game.\n\nState of the series\n\nThe series shifts back to SunTrust Park in Atlanta for the winner-take-all Game 5 on Wednesday. The Cardinals are expected to start Game 2 starter Jack Flaherty, who was one of the majors\u2019 best pitchers in the second half of the season. Flaherty earned the loss in Game 2 despite a solid start over seven innings. He had a microscopic 0.91 ERA over 15 second-half starts and put up a 2.25 ERA in two starts against the Braves, both of which came in May.\n\nThe Braves will turn to Mike Foltynewicz, who was brilliant opposite Flaherty in Game 2. Folty rediscovered his form upon his return from a minor league stint, going 6-1 with a 2.65 ERA in 10 starts since Aug. 5.\n\nThe winner will face the winner between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Washington Nationals in the NLCS.", "description": "The Cardinals beat the Braves 5-4 in 10 inning to even NL Division Series two games apiece.\u00a0Game 5 is Wednesday in Atlanta", "authors": ["Scott Boeck", "Published P.M.
