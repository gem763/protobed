And don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not all late-stage happenings. We\u2019re discussing early-stage news every week because that\u2019s what the listeners want!\n\nUp top we dug into Kate\u2019s excellent work covering the Superhuman founder\u2019s new micro fund, or at least his attempt at raising such a fund. Our main question is how can he be a good VC and a good executive at the same time? Folks don\u2019t tend to do both at the same time because they\u2019re each more than full-time jobs. Having two such gigs sounds hard.\n\nBut hey, it\u2019s not just athletes and musicians who can bring outsized interest to deals. In-demand founders can have a similar effect. We\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on the upcoming fun. Moving on.\n\nNext we turned to the other end of the venture landscape, looking at Founder\u2019s Fund\u2019s new capital vehicles. With a combined $2.7 billion in eventual capital, FF is hoping to build a financial redoubt from which they can rain capital down on late-stage targets wherever they may be.\n\nIs it a bit late in the cycle to cut late-stage checks to companies that might otherwise go public? That\u2019s the gamble so far as we can see it, but perhaps with WeWork\u2019s IPO dreams turned to nightmares, there\u2019s demand among a group of companies for another 12 months in the private markets. And that means more money is required.\n\nOn the theme of more money, Lime is raising some more and we were treated to new financial results from The Information\u2019s great work getting the figures. Or discussion asked the question of how far the company\u2019s unit economics could improve. Kate said that Lime is investing a lot now in developing better hardware, so their scooters can last more than 5 minutes on the roads before breaking down. She thinks things will start looking up when its deploying only new, fancy, good scooters. Alex is bearish.\n\nBefore we could turn back to the early-stage market and wrap up, we had to cover the latest from WeWork. SoftBank did in the end come and save the day (at least for now) for the company, meaning that WeWork lives on, though layoffs are expected sooner rather than later. Who knows what the future holds\u2026\n\nAnd finally, Vendr, a company that is profitable, raised a $2 million round. This is interesting because, again, it\u2019s profitable! And the startup willing shared some financial data with us\u2013a rarity.
