She was 74.\n\nA family spokesperson, Gwendolyn Quinn, confirmed the death. A statement released to the Associated Press said Ms. Norman died from septic shock and multi-organ failure secondary to complications from a spinal cord injury she suffered in 2015.\n\nMs. Norman was a trailblazing performer and one of the few black singers to attain worldwide stardom in the opera world, performing at such revered houses as La Scala in Milan and the Metropolitan Opera in New York and singing title roles in celebrated works including Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen\u201d and Verdi\u2019s \u201cAida.\u201d She also excelled in the works of Wagner but was not limited to opera or classical music, performing songs by Duke Ellington and others as well.\n\n\u201cI have always been drawn to things other people might consider unusual. I\u2019m always taken by the text and beautiful melody. It\u2019s not important to me who has written it. It\u2019s just more reasonable to have an open mind about what beauty is,\u201d Ms. Norman said in a 2002 interview with the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for classical musicians to stretch and think beyond the three B\u2019s (Bach, Beethoven and Brahms). They were wonderful composers, but they went to the great beyond a long time ago. There\u2019s lots of music that will live for a very long time.\u201d\n\nMs. Norman knew few boundaries or limits. She broke barriers and had hoped her industry would see more faces like hers.\n\n\n\nMs. Norman portrays Emilia Marty in Jan\u00e1\u010dek's \u201cThe Makropulos Case\u201d at the Metropolian Opera during the 1995-1996 season.

She grew up singing in church and with a musical family that included pianists and singers. She received a scholarship to study music at Howard University in Washington and later studied at the Peabody Conservatory and the University of Michigan.\n\nShe made her operatic debut in 1969 in Berlin and stunned audiences in Milan, London and New York with her shining vocals, no matter the language. The New York Times described her voice as \u201ca grand mansion of sound.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt defines an extraordinary space. It has enormous dimensions, reaching backward and upward. It opens onto unexpected vistas. It contains sunlit rooms, narrow passageways, cavernous falls,\u201d the Times\u2019 Edward Rothstein wrote in a 1992 review.\n\nThe Met Opera called Ms. Norman \u201cone of the great sopranos of the past half-century\u201d in a statement.\n\n\u201cStarting with her Met debut as Cassandra in Berlioz\u2019s Les Troyens on Opening Night of the Met\u2019s centennial 1983-84 season, Norman sang more than 80 performances with the company, dazzling audiences with her beautiful tone, extraordinary power, and musical sensitivity,\u201d the statement read.\n\nIn 1997, at age 52, Ms. Norman became the youngest person ever to earn the Kennedy Center Honors in the organization\u2019s 20-year history at the time. She received a National Medal of Arts from President Barack Obama.\n\nShe received 15 Grammy nominations, picking up her first at the 1985 show for best classical vocal soloist performance for \u201cRavel: Songs of Maurice Ravel.\u201d She earned a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006.\n\nMs. Norman raised funds to help students attend school, championing the arts in schools and championing diversity.\n\n\u201cI look at symphony orchestras around this country and I want those orchestras to look more like the demographic they\u2019re meant to serve. I would like to see more African Americans on the stage at the Metropolitan Opera here in New York. There are certainly some, but not nearly enough, and I come across so many singers who are terribly gifted and that would be an asset to these opera companies around our country.\n\n\u201cBut we still have these people who are just a little bit hesitant, and perhaps not as openhearted ... as I\u2019d like them to be,\u201d she said. \u201cI look forward to the day when we do not think about color of skin when we\u2019re looking to have a person do a job, whatever that job is.\u201d\n\nThe Jessye Norman School of the Arts opened in 2003 in Augusta to provide free fine arts education to disadvantaged children. She released a memoir, \u201cStand Up Straight and Sing!,\u201d in 2014.\n\nSurvivors include a brother and a sister.\n\n\u2014Associated Press", "description": "The celebrated soprano was a trailblazing performer and one of the few black singers to attain worldwide stardom in the opera world.", "authors": ["Mesfin Fekadu", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/sCdTMBolZeQ-vRGoqwmpQcffzMY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FYQOZZXD4YI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
