USA TODAY Sports\n\nATLANTA \u2014 The entire construct of a Game 5 to decide a Major League Baseball playoff series is supposed to lend itself to hold-your-breath drama on every pitch.\n\nBut as we found out Wednesday at Sun Trust Park, the air was a little too thin for one of the participants. The St. Louis Cardinals blew the Atlanta Braves out of the postseason and into the history books, unleashing a playoff record 10-run first inning that took all the suspense away before the Braves even came up to bat.\n\nBehind 11 base hits and a solid six-inning start from Jack Flaherty, the Cardinals eventually finished off a 13-1 win that sends them back to the National League Championship Series for the first time since 2014.\n\nThe Braves, meanwhile, are left to contemplate an all-systems failure at the season\u2019s biggest moment. Atlanta has made nine straight trips to the playoffs without advancing, last winning a playoff series in 2001 against the Houston Astros.\n\nTurning point\n\nIn a sense, the turning point of the series occurred Monday in Game 4 when the Braves led 4-3 in the eighth inning, needing just five more outs to wrap up the series until catcher Yadier Molina tied it up with an RBI single and then won the game with a sacrifice fly in the 10th.\n\nAtlanta had plenty of opportunities to wrap up the series right there, getting nothing out of bases-loaded situations in the sixth and seventh innings but hoped that they could capitalize on playing Game 5 at home.\n\nInstead, the Braves simply made a mess of things right away. They could have struck out leadoff hitter Dexter Fowler but didn\u2019t as catcher Brian McCann dropped strike three, leading to a walk. They could have gotten out of the inning having given up just one run, but first baseman Freddie Freeman booted a ground ball and a likely double play, loading the bases. They could have limited the damage, but starter Mike Foltynewicz walked in a run and relief pitcher Max Fried walked in another, failing to find the plate against Flaherty.\n\nEverything that could go wrong for Atlanta did, and St. Louis busted the game open on hard-hit doubles by Tommy Edman, Fowler and Kolten Wong.\n\nManager\u2019s special\n\nThe Braves may look back with some regret at manager Brian Snitker\u2019s decision to set the playoff rotation so that rookie Mike Soroka, who was arguably their best pitcher this year, started just once in the series. The 22-year old Soroka posted a 2.68 ERA during the regular season, the best among Atlanta\u2019s starters, and was terrific in Game 3 giving up just two hits and one run in seven innings.\n\nSoroka would have been available to pitch in a key spot in Game 5 if necessary, but the first-inning struggles made that idea irrelevant.\n\nWould the series have gone differently if Soroka had started Games 1 and 4 instead of Dallas Keuchel, who allowed four earned runs over eight combined innings? We\u2019ll never know, but the only getting one appearance out of a pitcher who was great in the regular season and great in the postseason feels like a mistake.\n\nSeries extremes\n\nThe Braves had absolutely no answer for Cardinals left fielder Marcell Ozuna in this series. Ozuna, who hit just .243 during the season, went 9-for-21 (.429) in the NLDS and posted at least one hit in every game. He also had a pair of home runs and five RBIs.\n\nAtlanta didn't get that kind of X-factor performance and, in fact, was let down mostly by its veteran bats in the series \u2013 none moreso than Freeman. A four-time All-Star, Freeman hit .200 (4 for 20) for the series and drove in just one run: A solo homer in the ninth inning of Game 1.\n\nFreeman had one more shot to do some damage on Wednesday. Down 13-1, the Braves loaded the bases for him with two outs in the fifth. St. Louis left in Flaherty, who appeared to be laboring a bit as he hit the 90-pitch mark. As the count reached 3-0, the crowd rose to its feet to urge him on, as if a hit might somehow give the Braves some hope of a comeback. Instead, Freeman hit a weak grounder to second on a 3-1 pitch that ended the inning.", "description": "The Cardinals cruised to victory in Game 5 after scoring 10 runs in the first inning, securing their first trip to the NLCS since 2014.", "authors": ["Dan Wolken", "Published P.M.
