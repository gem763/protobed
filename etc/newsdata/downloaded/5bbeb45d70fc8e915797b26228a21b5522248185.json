CEO Gary Kelly said the Southwest board has directed him to study whether the airline should start buying planes from other aircraft makers, which would almost certainly be Boeing's European rival, Airbus.\n\n\"We put our future in the hands of Boeing and the Max and were grounded,\" Kelly said on CNBC.\n\nThat has cost Southwest $435 million in operating income since March when the Max was taken out of the air by regulators after a second fatal crash. American put its cumulative Max-related loss at $540 million. American Airlines Chairman and CEO Doug Parker said he is in early talks over compensation.\n\n\"We feel highly confident that the losses that American Airlines has incurred won't be incurred by American shareholders, but will be borne by the Boeing shareholders,\" Parker said on a call with analysts and reporters. Parker and Kelly both repeated that their airlines maintain their full faith in Boeing's ability to fix the plane, and they are eager to put them back into service.\n\n", "description": "Grounded Boeing Plane Churns up More Turbulence at Airlines", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/25/2019102500449_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
