Halloween is over! Ciara and Russell Wilson did it, and they won. The couple re-created Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cApeshit\u201d music video, in which they take over the Louvre. For those under a very specific but very large rock, the video ends with Beyonc\u00e9 and her husband posed in front of the actual Mona Lisa, wearing pink and blue suits, daring anyone to call them poor. Ciara and Russell paid homage by standing in front of a portrait of Barack and Michelle Obama, kind of like how Bey and Jay stood in front of a portrait of Meghan Markle to accept their BRIT Award. Ciara even snagged the exact same suit Beyonc\u00e9 wore, a Peter Pilotto creation. In their own mini music video, Wilson conjures up Big Hov Energy and mean-mugs while Ciara spits bars. Sitting back while your wife handles business is the most important detail in a Jay-Z costume.\n\nThey even finish it off by turning away from the camera! Considering Beyonc\u00e9 waited an entire year to show us her third costume, if this is the only glimpse of Halloween Bey we get this year, thank goodness it\u2019s flawless.", "description": "Ciara and Russell Wilson dressed up as Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z in their \u201cApeshit\u201d music video for Halloween 2019.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/30/30-ciara-russ-wilson.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
