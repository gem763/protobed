Roger Wicker. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images Technology Senator 'deeply disappointed' Zuckerberg declined to testify on extremism\n\nThe Republican chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee said he's \"deeply disappointed\" that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg declined to take part in an upcoming hearing on violent and extremist content online and urged him to reconsider, according to a letter obtained by POLITICO.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), in the Sept. 4 letter, pressed Zuckerberg to \u201cpersonally participate\u201d in the hearing.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cAs a dominant social networking platform, Facebook has a significant role in the communications marketplace,\u201d Wicker wrote. \u201cYour direct engagement as the chief executive officer of Facebook on this issue will be invaluable to our efforts to protect communities and enhance public safety.\u201d\n\nThe senator indicated that he and Zuckerberg spoke previously about what Facebook is doing to remove extremist content.\n\nFacebook couldn't immediately be reached for comment. The Senate Commerce Committee didn't immediately respond to a request for more information on the letter and whether Wicker has pressed other tech company executives to participate.\n\nAccording to the letter, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asked the Commerce Committee to participate in an effort to address mass violence following shootings in Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas. The alleged gunman in the El Paso shooting was linked to an anti-immigrant screed posted on the anonymous online message board 8chan prior to the attack.\n\nWicker wrote that the upcoming hearing will \u201cexamine how social media companies are identifying and removing violent and extremist content from their platforms and what Congress can do to assist those efforts.\u201d", "description": "Sen.
