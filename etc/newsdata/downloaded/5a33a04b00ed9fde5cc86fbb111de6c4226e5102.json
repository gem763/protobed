All are in central terminal buildings, mostly positioned for arriving passengers. That means a slight detour on your way to the gate.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re not a fan of fast food, and don\u2019t want to fork up for an airport lounge, stopping in here to stock up may just be your best bet.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s another small catch: because they are in the public sections of airports, you have to take what you buy through security. If you are on a domestic flight there\u2019s no restriction for liquids, but watch out for those on international flights.\n\nThese are your best bets for quick takeaways\n\nOR Tambo: Chicken Licken has a branch in the heart of OR Tambo - and it\u2019s received glowing reviews from travellers who\u2019ve had a craving while passing through Terminal B.\n\nCape Town: Woolworths Food is the best bet for a quick sandwich or wrap - though it\u2019s location before security might be an issue for some travellers.\n\nKing Shaka: Kauai is the healthiest - and freshest - takeaway food you\u2019ll find at King Shaka.\n\nAnd if you have the time for a sit-down meal before departure, try these restaurants.\n\nOR Tambo: Airport Craft Brewers is the first airport restaurant on the continent with an on-site brewery. They have branches both sides of security, a food menu that includes everything from breakfasts to burgers, and craft beer priced similarly to that in the outside world.\n\nCape Town: Aside from the usual fast food offerings of Wimpy and Mugg and Bean, the only real option after security at Cape Town International is the Alba Easy Lounge with its wraps, burgers, and reasonable selection of wines.\n\nKing Shaka: Soaring Falcon Spur Steak Ranch is the best - if pretty much the only - real option for a sit-down meal while passing through King Shaka.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "You have a couple of options at each of South Africa's major airports to keep yourself fed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9442/5039cb25b5d8474fb02b59e103758294.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
