He shot an innocent woman with a firearm. He gets acquitted,\" Watters argued. \"He gets protection [in] a sanctuary city but a law-abiding NRA member is labeled a terrorist. That's absolutely crazy.\"\n\nWatters was referencing the news Friday that a California state appeals court overturned the lone conviction against an undocumented immigrant who shot and killed Kate Steinle on the San Francisco waterfront in 2015, a case that drew national attention and became a flashpoint in the debate over illegal immigration.\n\nThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution Tuesday saying the U.S. is \u201cplagued by an epidemic of gun violence\" and accusing the NRA of using \u201cits considerable wealth and organization strength to promote gun ownership and incite gun owners to acts of violence.\u201d\n\n2020 DEMS RAMP UP CALLS TO MANDATE ASSAULT WEAPONS BUYBACK: 'ALL OF THEM'\n\nWatters warned that Democrats are planning to confiscate guns from Americans and said it was impossible to do so.\n\n\"People like to say, 'You know, there are 10 to 20 million illegal immigrants in this country. You can't just round them up. It's impossible. It's too many people.' Well, there are hundreds of millions of firearms in this country ... How are you going to confiscate and round all those up, either?\" Watters said. \"It's impossible.\"\n\nCo-host Dana Perino said it was not up to the County Board of Supervisors to label groups \"domestic terrorists\" and they could better serve their city's constituents by focusing on other problems.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\n\n\"There's a lot of problems that they should focus on and when you're the County Board of Supervisors that's what you should do,\" Perino advised.\n\nFox News' Samuel Chamberlain and Adam Shaw contributed to this report.", "description": "Fox News' Jesse Watters was fired up on \"The Five\" Wednesday over San Francisco passing a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association \"a domestic terrorist organization.\"", "authors": ["Victor Garcia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Watters-SFSeal.jpg"}
