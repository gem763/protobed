When Ms. Zhang was arrested in March, she had a cache of electronics, including four cellphones, nine USB drives and a device that can detect hidden cameras, according to prosecutors.\n\nBut in the end, Ms. Zhang was convicted only of unlawful entry and of making false statements to the U.S. Secret Service. When she first entered the Mar-a-Lago grounds in Palm Beach on March 30, she told a Secret Service agent she was there to visit the pool. She later told agents that she was there to attend a \u201cUnited Nations Friendship Event,\u201d which previously had been canceled.\n\nShe faces a maximum of about five years in prison and is scheduled to be sentenced in November.\n\nThe case has highlighted potential security vulnerabilities at Mar-a-Lago and efforts by foreign and domestic parties to seek access to the president and his confidantes outside of standard protocols.\n\nMr. Trump had been visiting the resort the same weekend Ms. Zhang entered the grounds.\n\nAt an April hearing, an assistant federal public defender representing Ms. Zhang at the time said she went to Mar-a-Lago to attend what she believed was a networking event and that she followed proper procedures. Her then-attorney had submitted evidence that Ms. Zhang had paid about $20,000 to a promoter for the event. By June, Ms. Zhang had asked the judge to be allowed to represent herself, which the judge approved with expressed misgivings.", "description": "A Chinese woman was convicted of unlawfully entering President Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, after her arrest earlier this year raised concerns about security at the president\u2019s clubs.", "authors": ["Aruna Viswanatha", "Aruna.Viswanatha Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106438/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
