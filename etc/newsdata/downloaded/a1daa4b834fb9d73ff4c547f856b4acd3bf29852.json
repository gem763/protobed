That saying is starting to spread in farm towns like Saladillo, after the populist-leaning Peronists won back power on Sunday.\n\nThis dusty soy, corn and cattle ranching town in the bread-basket province of Buenos Aires was a bastion of support for farm-friendly incumbent Mauricio Macri. He was seen here as a free-markets messiah when elected in 2015 after eight years of populist, protectionist rule.\n\nFarmers \u201csaddled up\u201d by planting at record levels when Macri, only days into his administration, ditched the heavy handed trade controls and export limits that previous President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner had put on corn and wheat.\n\nNow she is back as the running mate of president-elect Alberto Fernandez, who will take office in December. Questions are swirling about his policies for the farm sector, Argentina\u2019s main source of sorely needed export dollars.\n\nAround Saladillo, a town soaked in farming, growers and traders said Fernandez would likely increase grains export taxes, which would hit profits. Some fear a full-on return to Fernandez de Kirchner\u2019s policies, which included strict export limits during her two-term 2007-2015 administration.\n\n\u201cIf that happens again, I will produce the minimum to get by, unsaddle, in other words, until the market comes back. We\u2019ve done it before. We can do it again if we have to,\u201d said Eduardo Bell, 63, who owns a 2,000-hectare farm and cattle ranch.\n\nAs popular as Macri is in Saladillo, where the town crest includes a cow and bags of wheat, his image nationwide had been battered by recession and high inflation. He came to power on promises or \u201cnormalizing\u201d Latin America\u2019s No. 3 economy after the distortions caused by robust state intervention in the markets under the Peronists before him.\n\nBut his orthodox policy signals were not enough to attract significant foreign direct investment to a country still plagued by cyclical financial crises and high business costs. The economy slumped, inflation ignited and debt fears rose.\n\nAnd he underestimated the inflationary effect of his fiscal policies, which included cuts to public utility subsidies, which heaped more costs on already hard-hit voters and small businesses, including farmers.\n\nPRODUCTION DROP\n\nArgentina is a major world supplier of soybeans, corn and wheat, as well as the No.1 exporter of soymeal livestock feed, fueling Asia\u2019s shift in diet from rice toward animal protein.\n\nBut uncertainty abounds in Saladillo, a quiet community of 27,000 residents. While voters turned against Macri in the August primary vote nationwide, handing Peronist Fernandez a huge margin of victory, Saladillo stuck by him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll come at the agricultural sector with every short-sighted policy they can think of, like export limits (quotas) and more export taxes,\u201d said Roberto Vaccarini, 60, a cattle broker in the town as he went to vote for Macri.\n\n\u201cProduction is going to go down, which means less investment and the farm economy stagnates.\u201d\n\nAfter voting at a country schoolhouse just outside Saladillo, one farmer and rancher praised Macri for lowering export barriers and taxes and said that the future looked uncertain under the Peronists.\n\n\u201cThese four years have been great for us,\u201d the farmer, who gave only his first name Oscar, told Reuters. \u201cBut we do not know what the Fernandez government is going to do.\u201d\n\nThat uncertainty was reflected around the town, despite some moves by Fernandez to reassure the farm sector.\n\n\u201cFernandez has not told us exactly what his plans are for the sector. When they don\u2019t tell you what their policies are, it\u2019s because they\u2019re hiding something,\u201d said Ernesto Marcenaro, 55, manager of a local agro-products company.\n\n\u201cIf he wanted to transmit confidence he would say he plans to keep the markets open, support production and promote exports.\u201d", "description": "There is a saying among farmers when times are hard on the Argentine Pampas: \"Unsaddle the horse until the sun comes out\".
