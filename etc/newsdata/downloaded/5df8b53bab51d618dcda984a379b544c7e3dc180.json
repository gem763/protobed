President Trump falsely claimed that his crowd (bottom) was bigger Reuters\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr Trump was asked whether he would provide Democrats the documents they sought before the Friday deadline expired.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s up to the lawyers. I know the lawyers think they\u2019ve never seen anything so unfair. They\u2019ve never seen anything so unjust,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been president now for almost three years, and I\u2019ve been going through this for almost three years. It\u2019s almost become, like, a part of my day.\u201d\n\nHe admitted that Democrats in the House of Representatives had the numbers to impeach him if the wished to, though he said he believed Republicans in the Senate would not confirm the censure. \u201cSo the Democrats. Unfortunately they have the votes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis subpoena changes nothing \u2013 just more document requests, wasted time, and taxpayer dollars that will ultimately show the president did nothing wrong,\u201d said spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

If she does not push for a vote, it is hard to see how long she would retain her position as the Democrats\u2019 leader in the House.\n\nReports said the White House was expected to send a letter to Ms Pelosi arguing that Congress could not mount its impeachment inquiry without first having a vote to authorise it. The letter was expected to say the administration wouldn\u2019t cooperate with the probe without that vote.\n\nMr Trump said the resolution would likely pass the House, but he predicted it would backfire on Democrats. \u201cI really believe that they\u2019re going to pay a tremendous price at the polls,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s comments came shortly before Democrats sent an extensive request for documents to vice president Mike Pence about his contacts with Ukraine. Mr Pence spokeswoman Katie Waldman, dismissed the new demand for documents, saying that given its wide scope, \u201cit does not appear to be a serious request\u201d.\n\nIt is likely the White House will claim the material sought by Congress is covered by executive privilege, an issue that will likely be resolved by the courts.\n\nMore follows\u2026", "description": "Democrats have issued a subpoena to the White House, demanding it hand over documents relating to Donald Trump\u2019s controversial Ukraine phone call, turning up the pressure of their", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/04/19/trump-subpoena.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
