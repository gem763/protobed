I believe the company is attempting to squash an individual who tried to correct its injustice. The management in fact seems to value when men work outside and women stay at home.\u201d\n\nParental leave in Japan is among the most generous in the world, entitling men and women to a year off work, or longer if there is no public childcare provision. But very few men use their paternity leave entitlement, fearing their careers will suffer.\n\nWomen outperform men after Japan medical school stops rigging exam scores Read more\n\nThe alleged mistreatment of men who take leave has given rise to a new phrase, patahara \u2013 short for paternity harassment. The term is modelled on matahara \u2013 or maternity harassment \u2013 used to describe abuse experienced by working women after becoming pregnant or giving birth.\n\nThe employee in the Asics case was initially criticised on Twitter, being described as \u201cselfish\u201d for taking a year of leave for each of his sons, now aged four and one.\n\nThe inability of male employees to take paternity leave is among the obstacles facing the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, as he attempts to increase the number of women in the workplace, particularly in senior positions, and raise the country\u2019s low birth rate.\n\nA corporate culture that values loyalty to the company and long hours, especially from male employees, means just 6% of eligible fathers take paternity leave, according to government data \u2013 way below the goal of 13% by 2020.\n\nMore than 70% of men who take paternity leave are away for less than a fortnight. That compares to more than 80% of mothers who use their allowance beyond the mandatory eight weeks after birth.\n\nThe challenge to social norms received a boost recently when the new environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi \u2013 a rising star of Japanese politics \u2013 said he would consider taking paternity leave when his wife gives birth next year.\n\nThe court plaintiff said: \u201cThere are plenty of people who want to take childcare leave, as it\u2019s their right, but they cannot because their workplace makes it difficult. Someone had to speak up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been thinking, I\u2019m going to be a salaryman for something like 40 years, so what\u2019s a year or two of leave compared to that.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff, one of a handful of men who have taken their employers to court, said he was transferred to a warehouse operated by an Asics subsidiary after he returned from his first period of paternity leave.\n\nAlthough he did not receive a pay cut or official demotion, he said the physical nature of the work was in stark contrast to his previous role in the company\u2019s personnel department.\n\nAsics allowed him to return to a desk job after he injured his shoulder, but gave him \u201cmeaningless\u201d tasks such as translating company guidelines into English, even though he has minimal language skills.\n\nHe wants to be reinstated in his original job, along with 4.4m yen ($41,000) in damages.\n\nAsics denies the allegations and said it had tried to negotiate with the plaintiff\u2019s union representatives and legal team.\n\n\u201cWe put effort into fostering diversity, and we will continue to make greater efforts to ensure our work environment and policies allow people to remain active through pregnancy, birth and childcare,\u201d the firm said in a statement.\n\nThe father\u2019s lawyer, Naoto Sasayama, said: \u201cThe culture established in a post-war Japan expects men to be the sole breadwinner. Stay-at-home men are considered extremely strange. We want to give hope to all those dads who want to take paternity leave.\u201d\n\nAgencies contributed to this report.", "description": "Father says he was transferred from personnel to warehouse role and given \u2018meaningless\u2019 tasks after returning from leave", "authors": ["Justin Mccurry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3eb3bcd7241db92d7e6716848993965fe73c0c2/0_53_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0905adeca8a982f8228b69f612775a21", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
