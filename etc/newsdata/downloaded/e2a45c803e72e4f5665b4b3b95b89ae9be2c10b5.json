Even as she commits to campaigning aggressively in Iowa, she is keeping up a busy national fund-raising schedule to avoid falling further behind financially; in July, August and September, Ms. Harris spent nearly $1.25 for every dollar she raised.\n\nThe restructuring came on the same day that a new poll, from USA Today/Suffolk, showed Ms. Harris dropping to 3 percent, down three percentage points since August. It puts Ms. Harris well behind the leaders and in a virtual tie with Representative Tulsi Gabbard, whom Ms. Harris thought so little of two months ago that she mostly ignored her attacks in the late July debate.\n\n\u201cCampaigns are about tough choices and this one is no different,\u201d Ms. Harris\u2019s communications director, Lily Adams, said on Twitter. \u201cKamala & this team launched with 1 goal in mind: win the nomination & take on Trump. It wasn\u2019t to just participate. We\u2019re going to make the hard choices necessary to put us in a place to achieve that goal.\u201d", "description": "The California senator\u2019s fund-raising struggles are prompting her to reboot her campaign with a focus on Iowa.", "authors": ["Astead W.
