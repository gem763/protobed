If he holds his position maybe he can clear it. Ash [Young] never really gets goal-side.\n\n\"But if you watch Rojo he just anticipates where the ball is going to be instead of staying with his man.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I think it\u2019s a poor goal to give away. But Liverpool , for that five and ten minutes, were knocking at the door and there you see Robertson crossing the ball a lot further up the pitch.\n\n\"Where for the majority of the game, him and Trent Alexander-Arnold were crossing the ball from 40, 45 yards out.\"", "description": "Adam Lallana's late leveller rescued a point for Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday", "authors": ["Jacob Murtagh", "Image", "Alex Livesey", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20662668.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Liverpool-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
