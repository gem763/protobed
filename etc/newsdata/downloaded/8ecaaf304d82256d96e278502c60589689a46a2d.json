Co-created with regular collaborators Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan, this Netflix series about an election for student-body president at a well-off Southern California high school has trouble staying focused and seems not to realize when its clever ideas cancel each other out. And it\u2019s so aggressively kitschy and cutesy that, on the rare occasions when it calms down and tries to be earnest and affecting, the sincerity comes across as calculated, like a politician tearing up while delivering the same campaign speech for the fourth time in a week.\n\nConsidering the show\u2019s many irritating and exhausting qualities, it\u2019s a small miracle that The Politician hangs together, much less that it manages to produce some touching and insightful moments. A good part of its cohesiveness comes from Dear Evan Hansen star Ben Platt\u2019s central performance as Payton Hobart, a Max Fischer\u2013esque obsessive overachiever. Payton lost his parents when he was young and was adopted by socialite Georgina Hobart (Gwyneth Paltrow) and her wealthy collector husband Keaton (Bob Balaban), who already have two arrogant and thuggish twin biological sons, played by Trey and Trevor Eason. Payton is a fish out of water who is accustomed to privilege but retains a certain affinity for society\u2019s outsiders. Since he was 7, he has pictured himself becoming president of the United States after graduating from his dream school, Harvard. Platt\u2019s anxious, dark energy and knack for smilingly aggressive patter nearly succeeds in making Payton seem like a plausible human being, rather than the anchor for a TV series of indeterminate purpose.\n\nPayton\u2019s purpose, however, is clear: He\u2019s determined to win the position of student-body president at his high school, even running against a dreamboat and natural-born star named River (David Corenswet, who looks like he could play Henry Cavill\u2019s kid brother). The dynamic between the two candidates is one of the series\u2019 many callbacks to Election \u2014 see: Tracy Flick and Paul Metzler \u2014 but it\u2019s complicated by the fact that they\u2019ve been lovers. (True to form for Murphy, this is a series with a wide and embracing sense of gender and sexuality: There\u2019s also a nonbinary student, Theo Germaine\u2019s James, on Payton\u2019s team, and one of his most formidable rivals is Rahne Jones\u2019s Skye, an out-and-proud lesbian.) Another frequent reference point comes through in the show\u2019s wide-shot compositions, whip-pan conversations, Futura Bold lettering, and overstuffed production design \u2014 it\u2019s all early Wes Anderson, right down to a pizzicato-violins\u2013plus\u2013mariachi-trumpet score that seems to exclaim, \u201cIsn\u2019t this all quite delicious!\u201d\n\nMurphy & Co. have clearly poured many high-school satires into their pastiche fusion machine here, not just Rushmore and Election but also Heathers and the team\u2019s own Popular and Glee (which comes through in the season\u2019s sporadic but flashy musical interludes), plus some added dollops of tabloid outrageousness. (A key subplot is very close to the story line of a ripped-from-the-headlines streaming series that just got multiple Emmy nominations). But The Politician never quite manages to create a personality of its own.\n\nI should not delve into the long-term mechanics of the election too deeply here, but suffice it to say that this series regularly flips itself upside down. Nearly every episode completely changes the dynamic and many of the key allegiances, taking some pieces off the narrative chessboard and adding others who get their own side plots to wander down, like Lucy Boynton\u2019s Astrid, River\u2019s girlfriend and Payton\u2019s sworn enemy. Ultimately, the series has too much plot and churns through it too ravenously, turning its narrative architecture into a blatant formula: setup, twist, setup, twist, cliffhanger ending, repeat. Payton goes through such an election-season roller coaster, with triumphs constantly giving way to disasters and then to last-minute rescues, that it starts to feel as though you\u2019re watching the third season of an existing series that has run out of ideas and is just trying to fill up every hour.\n\nNor does it help that one of the key story lines turns out to be a black hole that pulls energy and running time away from the main narrative. Payton chooses a spunky, wheelchair-using, possible leukemia sufferer named Infinity Jackson (Zoey Deutch) as his running mate to make himself seem as enlightened as possible and to win sympathy votes from Infinity\u2019s fans. This brings a lot of unnecessary melodrama into an already fraught campaign, a lot of which comes from Infinity\u2019s grandma Dusty, a stage mama and grifter whose scam becomes apparent a lot more quickly than the writers probably wanted it to.\n\nDusty is played by Murphy diva-in-residence Jessica Lange, replacing Barbra Streisand, who was originally cast in the role but bowed out. Lange is characteristically thrilling playing a boozy manipulator with a self-glorifying anecdote for every occasion. (Her deep-fried country-music accent here evokes her acclaimed performance as Patsy Cline in Sweet Dreams; she pronounces motel as MOE-tell and proclaims, \u201cI\u2019m just a little ol\u2019 country girl.\u201d) But the show\u2019s determination to keep Dusty and Infinity smack-dab in the middle of things makes it seem as if The Politician never quite figured out how it wanted to express its ideas about the corruption of electoral politics by money and power and about the toxic superficiality of American culture in the social-media era. And unlike Election, The Politician never gets a handle on the main irony of its plot: These teenagers, many of whom are played by actors who look like they\u2019re old enough to play teachers, are running for an office that has no actual power to speak of. And it\u2019s never believable, even in the context of a borderline fable, that so many of the students would be carrying on like James Carville or Mary Matalin, obsessing over numbers and polling. (The main joke on the Election characters was that nobody cared about the election except the three students running in it and a couple of faculty members with axes to grind.) The final episode, which has the sad sting of Michael Ritchie\u2019s The Candidate, brings the microcosm of high school out into the wider world, confronting idealists with the entrenched bureaucratic and capitalistic status quo that\u2019s going to paralyze them as grown-ups. But it\u2019s too little, too late.\n\nHowever, if you stick with the series through the fifth chapter, you\u2019ll be rewarded with one of the most perfect and corrosive episodes of the TV year: It turns out this very tight campus election will be settled by a handful of undecided, mostly bored and uninterested voters, and the story focuses on one of them, a nihilistic, slack-jawed compulsive masturbator who can\u2019t stop staring at girls\u2019 butts, vaping, or playing video games long enough to listen during the candidates\u2019 speeches, and tells one of the contenders that the most pressing issues on campus are the absence of hot Cheetos in the vending machines and the lack of individual restrooms. This installment could be lifted out of its context and stand on its own as a short film; the scene between the undecided voter and one of the candidates is one of the most perfect things Murphy and his team have ever been associated with.\n\nBut I\u2019m not sure a single glorious hour is worth the lead-up, and by the time you enter the final chapter, depressing social critiques notwithstanding, you\u2019re back to more wasted motion with Murphy & Co. refocusing their attention from the student election to a conspiracy potboiler. It\u2019s more of an epilogue setting up an already-confirmed second season \u2014 the show is intended to follow Payton across several pivotal elections throughout his life \u2014 but, like too many elements of this series, it feels as if it would have been better served on its own show. Much like its hero\u2019s determination to win his high-school election, The Politician\u2019s presence on Netflix feels like the by-product of ambition and chutzpah rather than an urgent need to effect change or communicate meaningful ideas.", "description": "A review of The Politician, the new Netflix series from Ryan Murphy, starring Ben Platt as a high-schooler running for class president, Gwyneth Paltrow as his socialite mom, and Zoey Deutch as his running mate with a secret.", "authors": ["Matt Zoller Seitz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/24/24-the-politician.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
