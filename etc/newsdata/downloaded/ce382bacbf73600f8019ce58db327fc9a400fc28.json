(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)\n\nThere is, primarily among Europeans, a fascination with the high political drama of the meteoric rise \u2014 on the international scene \u2014 and potential fall of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau.\n\n\"The world is paying attention to Canada and elections,\" said the diplomat. \"Justin Trudeau was popular \u2014 so popular \u2014 and how relatively quickly, in three years, support for him went down. People are simply interested.\"\n\nThe wider, perhaps more worrying, aspect of whether Canada's political landscape will be upended by anti-establishment forces has also been a major preoccupation as assessments are prepared, the diplomat added.\n\n\"All elections are important at the moment because of this populist movement and people want to see whether populism is gaining, or whether we are going back to some kind of normality,\" the diplomat added.\n\nA Canadian foreign policy expert said, for the most part, no one has seen much evidence of a populist backlash.\n\nPopulism a worry\n\n\"Populism is certainly on all of their files and they're asking the question of where Canada is headed on this one,\" said Colin Robertson, vice-president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute. \"Thus far, there's a strain of it in Canada and many of [the diplomats] say there's less populism here than in their own countries.\"\n\nMany European countries have also been alert, perhaps more than most, for signs of foreign interference and election tampering.\n\nThe visceral reaction in English Canada to the publication of photos of Trudeau in both brownface and blackface startled some of the foreign missions from the Far East.\n\n\"We did not realize it would have such a strong impact on the Liberal campaign and it was such an important issue for Canadians until, like, a few days later,\" said a diplomat from the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\"I was truly amazed; shocked, in fact. Perhaps it's a culture thing. We don't know, but truly speaking we were amazed to see the impact.\"\n\nRobertson said it was the moment many in the diplomatic community, both inside and outside of Ottawa, remember, even though it appeared to have had a minimal impact on the direction of the campaign.\n\nLook at other parties\n\nThere seems to be a general acceptance among other countries that Canada is headed toward a minority government, said Robertson, and consequently each of the embassies is diving into the details of not only the Liberal and Conservative election promises, but also those of their potential partners.\n\nThey're combing the platforms of the NDP, the Green Party and the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois looking for clues on how each of them could affect a minority Parliament. There has been some attention paid to the People's Party of Canada, but several diplomats said they do not expect to see that party hold the balance of power.\n\nAlmost all of the envoys registered concern about how a minority government would affect Canada's climate change policy and leadership.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer gestures as he responds to a question during a campaign stop in Quebec City. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)\n\nSome countries in the Far East, looking for energy security and business investment, have been drawn to the debate over pipeline politics and whether the Trans-Mountain project will be completed.\n\nOne longtime veteran of the Ottawa diplomatic circuit expressed amazement at how the issue of Canada's debt and deficit seems to have lost its sting after years of dominating the political agenda under the former Conservative government.\n\nThe curiosity sometimes extends to the personalities.\n\nRobertson said he was buttonholed recently by a Russian diplomat who was curious about Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland's chances of re-election.\n\nShe was barred from entering Russia after her outspoken criticism over the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and has regularly faced the wrath of the Kremlin.", "description": "Most of the foreign embassies in Ottawa are writing home this week with their take on the potential outcome of Canada's federal election.
