We will not be refunding your order however, we can refund your shipping fees.\n\nFeud: Amanda Holden insisted she's 'not a princess' as she engaged a in spat with a tile company who accused her of using her 'celebrity status to get special treatment'\n\nAnnoyed: Amanda had ordered some tiles to her home but the incorrect ones were sent out and she already had tilers on site, so she was out of pocket\n\n'Alternatively, we can refund your whole order for you and not send these out.\n\n'Unfortunately we do not make exceptions for 'celebrity' status and all of our customers are treated the same as per our terms and conditions.\n\n'We will happily refund you your shipping for the inconvenience.'\n\nMailOnline has seen the full transcript between Amanda and Appleby's and it's clear that Amanda does not use her celebrity status to get special treatment.\n\nCalling them out: Amanda shared some of the exchange on Twitter - MailOnline has read the full transcript and at no point did she use her celebrity status to get special treatment\n\nOuch! A representative called Jack accused her of using her status to get the free tiles, but Amanda didn't see why she should pay for the company's mistake. Appleby's say customers should not book in builders until their tiles have been received\n\nShe makes clear that she had to pay for tilers who were already at her house and were anticipating receiving the tiles that day and didn't feel that she should be out of pocket for this.\n\nBut Appleby's stated that they advise customers to not book in builders until they have received their tiles.\n\nAmanda wrote on Twitter: 'Well, what a useless company.\n\n'Don't usually name & shame but this reply wound me up!! I\u2019m no [princess emoji] & hate the word celebrity-didn\u2019t ask for special anything BUT the order is under my name.\n\nTwo sides: MailOnline called Appleby's but their phone line was disabled due to a high volume of calls - however, they did respond quickly via their online chat service to give their side of the story\n\nNot impressed: Amanda shared screenshots of more of the conversation on Instagram\n\n'I don\u2019t expect any special service. JUST a SERVICE would be good.'\n\nShe also wrote on Instagram: 'I\u2019m so cross that Appleby-co.uk seem to have no proper customer service. Firstly The order was under my name.\n\n'We didn\u2019t ask for a special service... Secondly the company have admitted it was their mistake but I still have to pay for tiles That are wrong ? How is this legal?\n\n'If they\u2019ve admitted the error. And thirdly \u2018Jack\u2019 needs to learn some people skills and have a glance at the Oxford English dictionary...\n\nOn her way: Amanda was pictured heading to work at Heart FM amid her spat\n\nAutumnal: Amanda looked incredible wearing grey trousers and a brown jumper\n\n'If there is another tiling company that could help us out I would be equally willing to big them up. As I frequently do with small British businesses. Why should we pay for their mistakes?? Literally?!!'\n\nMailOnline called Appleby's tiles for a comment but they claim to have disabled their phone line due to receiving a large amount of calls.\n\nHowever, they quickly responded to an email in which they wrote:\n\n'Amanda Holden placed an order with us for some items, these were delivered as agreed however, due to a picking error the incorrect tiles had been sent out.\n\nHome is where the heart is: Amanda takes great pride in decorating her home and regularly shares pictures of it on Instagram\n\n'Upon speaking to a representative for Amanda we informed them that, we would get these exchanged as soon as possible.\n\n'The representative then went on to inform us of Amanda\u2019s \u201cStatus\u201d for which we informed them that there is nothing more we can do than offer an exchange and regardless of status, all customers are treated the same.\n\n'We the offered to refund the postage paid in full as well as exchanging the tiles as soon as they became available.\n\n'The representative asked that we provided these tiles for free we informed them we could not however, we are happy to fully refund Amanda and collect the wrong tiles or, refund the postage charges and have the tiles exchanged to the correct tiles.'\n\nA spokesperson for Amanda also told MailOnline: 'On top of all this, a large percentage of the tiles are damaged too!\n\n'Her tiler took pictures of them yesterday. So not only are they the wrong tiles, but they are damaged too.\n\n'She just wanted to return them and have the correct ones sent.'", "description": "A furious Amanda Holden took to Twitter on Tuesday to deny she's a 'princess' after engaging in a spat with a tile company called Appleby's.", "authors": ["Rebecca Davison For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/12/19440300-0-image-a-7_1570534334043.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
