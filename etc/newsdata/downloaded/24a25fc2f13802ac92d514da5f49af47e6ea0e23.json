(AP) - Jayden Daniels scored on a 17-yard scramble with 34 seconds left and threw three touchdown passes to ailing Brandon Aiyuk, leading No. 18 Arizona State to a 38-34 comeback victory over Washington State on Saturday.\n\nArizona State (5-1, 2-1 Pac-12) trailed by three after Blake Mazza made a 31-yard field goal with 2 1/2 minutes left. Taking over at their own 25-yard line, the Sun Devils moved quickly down the field behind Daniels\u2019 pinpoint passing.\n\nThe freshman capped the drive with his scramble, helicoptering off a defender into the end zone.\n\nDaniels threw for 363 yards on 26-of-36 passing. Aiyuk had seven catches for 196 yards despite an illness that kept him out for portions of the game.\n\nAnthony Gordon threw for 466 yards and three touchdowns, but Washington State (3-3, 0-3) was again let down by its defense.\n\nThe Cougars lead the nation in passing yards per game, are fourth in total offense and eighth in scoring.\n\nWashington State was good against Arizona State from the start.\n\nGordon took advantage of blown coverages by Arizona State to hit Travell Harris on a 35-yard touchdown and Dezmon Patmon on a 2-yard score to put the Cougars up 17-7.\n\nWhere Washington State has struggled is on defense, so much that defensive coordinator Tracy Claeys abruptly resigned this week.\n\nWashington State\u2019s defense was solid early under interim coordinator Roc Bellantoni, sacking Daniels three times in the first nine plays while holding Arizona State to 23 yards in the first quarter.\n\nThe Sun Devils came alive behind the Daniels-Aiyuk connection. The pair hooked up on a 40-yard touchdown early in the second quarter, then Aiyuk broke a tackle to turn a short completion into an 86-yard score .\n\nCristian Zendejas\u2019 31-yard field goal on the final play of the first half tied the game at 17-all.\n\nArizona State took a 24-17 lead to open the second half when Eno Benjamin turned a fourth-and-1 into a 32-yard touchdown run.\n\nWashington State responded with drives of 91 and 92 yards, scoring on a 2-yard pass from Gordon to Easop Winston Jr. and Max Borghi\u2019s 2-yard run.\n\nDaniels and Aiyuk connected for a third score, a 33-yarder to tie it at 31-all.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nAnother huge offensive game (532 total yards) by Washington State, another defensive letdown leaves the Cougars winless in Pac-12 play.\n\nThe calm, cool play of their freshman quarterback has the Sun Devils rising, likely up a few spots in next week\u2019s AP Top 25.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWashington State hosts Colorado next Saturday.\n\nArizona State plays at Utah next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jayden Daniels scored on a 17-yard scramble with 34 seconds left and threw three touchdown passes to ailing Brandon Aiyuk, leading No. 18 Arizona State to a 38-34 comeback victory over Washington State on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Marshall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/washington_st_arizona_st_football_09025_c0-150-3600-2250_s1200x700.jpg?187bc123cc4510feb7f1966081317bdd024739c4", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
