They are also vital for wind turbines and electric vehicles.\n\nASX-listed Lynas is the biggest supplier of rare earths outside China, and is edging closer to making an official call on building a first-stage processing plant next door to BHP\u2019s Nickel West operations outside Kalgoorlie, in Western Australia.\n\nMr Ross is expected to meet Mr Morrison, Trade and Investment Minister Simon Birmingham and business leaders during the visit.\n\nThe US-China trade war and broader US-Australia trade and investment relations are also expected to be discussed during Mr Ross' visit.\n\nHe will be the keynote speaker at an American Chamber of Commerce in Australia lunch on Thursday in Sydney, in an address promoting Mr Ross as the \"principal voice of business in the Trump administration\".\n\nThe US Studies Centre report probes whether the government should use taxpayer money to develop rare earths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Australia has at least half a dozen rare earth projects ready for development but needing commitments from potential customers and financiers,\" Mr Uren noted.\n\n\"Neither banks nor equity markets will finance them.\n\n\"The Australian government could, at a stretch, use the 'national interest account' at Export Finance Australia to assist.\n\n\"However, it would have to go into any such commitment with its eyes open to the possibility of losses to the taxpayer \u2013 rare earths have often been in oversupply with poor prices.\"\n\nThe Morrison government has put a heavy focus on downstream investment in rare earths and other so-called critical minerals processing since their supply emerged as a flashpoint in the trade war between Washington and Beijing.\n\nLynas is the only non-Chinese supplier of any scale for rare earth materials such as neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr) used in permanent magnets. In partnership with Blue Line Corporation, the company is working on plans to develop a heavy rare earth separation capacity at a plant in Texas.", "description": "The joint development of rare earths and other critical mineral deposits, which are vital to national security, will be high on the agenda for the visit to Australia this week by US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1bdd0ff339d3482ef9d7f332ba332c6ece1f46b1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
