That breaks down as: once-weekly day trips to Melbourne and/or Brisbane (a total of 30 domestic trips); fortnightly short-haul day/24-hour trips, typically to Singapore or Jakarta (20 regional trips); and monthly \u201cglobal sprints\u201d of two to three days at a time to Europe (Warsaw, Madrid, London) and the US, either Chicago or the west coast (10 international trips).\n\nWhat are your preferred airlines and your top frequent flyer loyalty cards?\n\nQantas and Singapore Airlines are my go-to carriers. I also fly Emirates and, more recently, Qatar within the Qantas/Oneworld network. I have more than 1 million points with Qantas Chairman\u2019s and Platinum One, and 500,000 points with KrisFlyer Solitaire PPS Club.\n\nWhere was your last trip?\n\nMy last trip was to New York for a set of client meetings in early July. I stayed in the Grand Hyatt, in downtown Manhattan. It\u2019s convenient because it\u2019s close to our meetings, but a bit \u201cindustrial strength\u201d.\n\nThe W Hotel on Lexington Ave is smaller and my preferred work hotel in NYC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no shortage of places to eat and entertain in NYC, and I\u2019m happy to share where I go alone or with close friends to enjoy great food: Sarge\u2019s Delicatessen & Diner on Third Ave (between 36th and 37th streets) for the best breakfasts; and Haandi (on 28th St and Lexington Ave), which is where the cabbies go for real Indian and Pakistani food.\n\nWhat\u2019s your top business travel tip?\n\nWhen travelling across time zones, set your watch to your destination the moment you take off. Mentally arriving in a time zone nine to 24 hours before your body does really helps you to hit the ground running.\n\nTravel briefs\n\nBest of British\n\nThe first of British Airways\u2019 18 new Airbus 350s landed at London Heathrow in late July, and four are expected to be flying before the end of the year. The most exciting aspect to the 350s is the business-class Club Suites. In a 1-2-1 configuration, every suite has all-aisle access, a fully flat bed and a sliding door. Passengers will also find 40 per cent more storage than traditional BA business class, plus Wi-Fi, 18.5-inch in-flight entertainment screens and PC/USB power. The 350s will operate mainly on trans-Atlantic routes (such as London-Toronto), but will also fly into Dubai. A good one for the discerning Australian executive traveller to keep in mind when on business in the northern hemisphere.\n\nA business-class Club Suite on British Airways' new Airbus 350.

Those looking for a truly luxurious transit can book AA's Five Star Service to secure off-terminal entry, private screening service and customs clearance inside the Private Suite. Also available is a Cadillac transfer across the tarmac to Flagship First Dining for those transiting in LA. Or beat the traffic with a private helicopter transfer in LA or New York.", "description": "For A.T.
