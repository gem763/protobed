Water from another planetary system has never before been spotted inside our solar system.\n\nBorisov was spotted by an amateur astronomer on 30 August, and the professionals have been scrambling to analyse before it flies away. Researchers had already detected gas being spewed from the comet\u2019s surface, but finding water would signal a hugely significant discovery.\n\nThe findings indicate that water-rich comets are not unique to the Solar System and that the universe is likely to contain other Earth-like worlds with the potential to support life.\n\nThe researchers from NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center studied the light reflected by Borisov and found large amounts of oxygen around the comet, which they believe is the result of water ice changing from solid to gas as it is heated by the sun.\n\nThe research suggests that Borisov produces up to 19 kilograms of water per second.\n\nAlso on rt.com New interstellar object heading our way, but this time we\u2019re ready for it\n\nResearcher Adam McKay notes that studying the water could give us a fascinating insight into other planetary systems. \u201cAre we special as a planetary system or are a lot of planetary systems like ours?\u201d he said to New Scientist. \u201cThat has implications for the origin of life, and how common life is throughout the universe.\u201d\n\nBorisov will reach its closest flyby of the sun on December 10, giving the scientific community at least another six weeks to examine the extraterrestrial visitor before it disappears from view.\n\nLike this story?
