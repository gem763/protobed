Thunberg, 16, is currently in California. But Sofia and Isabella Axelsson quoted Thunberg as saying that \u201cwhat we need is for our rulers and politicians to listen to the research.\u201d\n\nThe Nordic Council hands out annual prizes for literature, youth literature, film, music and the environment, each worth 350,000 Danish kroner ($52,000).\n\nIt was not the first prize that the climate activist has won or been nominated for.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

There, she scolded a U.N. climate conference in September , repeatedly asking, \u201cHow dare you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in the beginning of a mass extinction and yet all you can talk about is money. You are failing us,\u201d she said.\n\nWeeks later, Thunberg won the 2019 Right Livelihood Award \u2014 known as the \u201cAlternative Nobel\u201d \u2014 \u201cfor inspiring and amplifying political demands for urgent climate action reflecting scientific facts.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Activist Thunberg declined the Nordic Council's award, saying that \"the climate movement does not need any more prizes.\"", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/greta-thunberg-turns-down-prize.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
