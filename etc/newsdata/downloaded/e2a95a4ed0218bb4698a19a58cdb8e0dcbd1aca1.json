They witnessed the effects of the Turkish-led military operation in northeast Syria which has been paused after the United States and Turkey announced a five-day ceasefire.\n\nSome of the people Al Jazeera spoke to left the country earlier than scheduled, citing inflation and a fear of the return of government control.\n\nIn al-Bab, while basic necessities such as water and electricity were unavailable, other costs of living were simply \"unaffordable\", one man said.\n\nThe pause in Turkey's operations is meant to grant Kurdish-led forces in the region a window to withdraw 30 kilometres (18.5 miles) south of the border, and away from the so-called \"safe zone\" Ankara wants to establish inside Syria.\n\nLaunched on October 9, the aim of the operation was to clear the region of Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), a group Ankara considers \"terrorists\" linked to Kurdish separatists on its soil.", "description": "Citing rising prices and fears of government takeover, Syrians return after months on the other side of the border.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/18/9981fcfcd3ff49e69d44f838a1e168ed_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
