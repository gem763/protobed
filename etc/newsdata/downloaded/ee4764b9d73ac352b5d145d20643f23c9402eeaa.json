The deal directly contradicts (and potentially threatens) one of the cornerstone efforts of his administration: an attempt to roll back even higher standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency under Barack Obama.\n\nTrump reportedly even summoned other automakers \u2014 General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, and Toyota \u2014 to the White House to pressure them to stick with the administration\u2019s plan, according to The New York Times.\n\nHe\u2019s reportedly trying to keep other automakers from joining the California deal\n\nThe new deal with California holds those four automakers (and any others who join the pact) to a standard similar to the one Obama\u2019s EPA set. Automakers would have to decrease the overall emissions of their new vehicle fleets until model year 2026, which in turn will make the new cars more fuel efficient. Since other states follow California\u2019s lead on air regulation, the deal has the potential to split the market if the Trump administration enacts a federal rule with lower standards. The New York Times report also names Mercedes-Benz as the next automaker most likely to join the other four in the pact.\n\nTrump tweeted late Wednesday night that Henry Ford is \u201crolling over\u201d in his grave at the \u201cweakness of current car company executives\u201d for taking the deal with California. In a statement, Ford said it is \u201cproud to lead the way in taking the right actions for the environment while at the same time protecting consumer affordability and the short- and long-term health of the industry.\u201d\n\n....that when this Administration\u2019s alternative is no longer available, California will squeeze them to a point of business ruin. Only reason California is now talking to them is because the Feds are giving a far better alternative, which is much better for consumers! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2019\n\nAutomakers originally lobbied Trump to relax the Obama-era rule, both before and after his inauguration. But instead of simply loosening the regulatory belt, the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ultimately proposed what amounts to a full rollback of the Obama-era rule. The Trump administration\u2019s rule would freeze the increasing fuel efficiency standards at 2020 levels (around 37 miles per gallon) and no longer hold automakers to the ultimate goal, which was an average fuel economy of more than 50 miles per gallon by model year 2025.\n\nThe Trump administration built its proposal around the idea that the high Obama-era standards would make new cars more expensive, pushing consumers to either buy older cars or stick with the one they already own. Since older cars are typically less efficient and don\u2019t have the safety features of newer ones, the Trump administration is essentially making a case to trade the environmental gains of the final five years of the Obama rule for potential upfront cost savings and a reduction in crash-related injuries and deaths.\n\nThe Trump administration says making cars more efficient will cost too much, though not everyone agrees\n\nTrump partially laid out this argument in a tweet on Wednesday, saying he is giving \u201cpolitically correct Automobile Companies\u201d the option of lowering the average price of a car by \u201cmore than $3000\u201d in exchange for \u201c[v]ery little impact on the environment.\u201d He also said his administration is trying to make new cars \u201csubstantially safer,\u201d a sentiment he echoed later tweets, despite the fact that the rule being written by the EPA and the NHTSA proposal has nothing to do with making new cars safer. He called automotive executives \u201cfoolish,\u201d though it\u2019s not explicitly clear if he was referring to the executives of Ford, Volkswagen, BMW, and Honda.\n\nTrump also tweeted that there could be a time where his administration\u2019s rollback is \u201cno longer available\u201d as an option, which could be a nod to the New York Times\u2019 reporting that he\u2019s considered pulling the rollback and focusing the fight on California\u2019s right under the Clean Air Act to set its own air regulations.\n\nMany experts disagree with the Trump administration\u2019s calculations. Some argue any potential savings on the sticker price of new cars would likely be offset by the increased fuel cost over the life of those vehicles, even if gas prices stay low. With less fuel-efficient cars, the rollback could also introduce hundreds of millions of metric tons of CO2 into the air, and increase oil consumption by more than 1 billion barrels, according to the EPA\u2019s own estimates.\n\n\u201cThe clean car standards are the most effective policy we have on the books to fight climate change, and the transportation sector is the country\u2019s largest source of the carbon pollution that causes climate change,\u201d nonprofit advocacy group Sierra Club said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s push for dirtier, less efficient vehicles would pump more carbon pollution into our air.\u201d\n\nThe EPA and the NHTSA are expected to unveil the final version of the rollback the Trump administration has been promising sometime this year, but The New York Times reports that staff members at those agencies are \u201cstruggling to assemble a coherent technical and scientific analysis required by law to implement a rule change of this scope.\u201d\n\nUpdate August 21st, 8:56PM ET: Added new Trump tweets and part of a statement from Ford.", "description": "Ford, Volkswagen, BMW, and Honda bucked his attempted emissions rollback by signing a deal with California, and The New York Times reports that the president is \"enraged.\"", "authors": ["Sean O'Kane", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nPkAxpW1VokFbXRzuKh82jjD4Bc=/0x430:6000x3571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18956742/1167022171.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-21"}
