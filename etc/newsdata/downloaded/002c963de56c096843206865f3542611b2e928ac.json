While being questioned by Mr. Younger\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Odeneal, Dr. Georgulas admitted that she used an egg donor.\n\nREAD: BREAKING: Jury rules against dad trying to save his 7-year-old from gender \u2018transition\u2019\n\nThe jury\u2019s ruling today means Dr. Anne Georgulas will be able to continue \u201ctransitioning\u201d James into \u201cLuna,\u201d and now has full authority to start him on puberty blockers and eventually cross-sex hormones.\n\nDr. Georgulas also testified that she and Mr. Younger knew the sex of the boys before they were born. She testified that they ordered a test to identify the sex of the embryos, at Mr. Younger\u2019s request.\n\nMr. Odeneal alluded earlier in the trial to the fact that Dr. Georgulas is not the biological mother of the children. Mr. Younger testified that he would \u201cnever deny the motherhood\u201d of Dr. Georgulas but said she isn\u2019t biologically related to James and Jude.\n\nThe focus of testimony last week and this morning revolved around the imminent threat of a medical \u201ctransition\u201d for James and the significant risks of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones.\n\nDr. Georgulas testified this morning that she thinks it is reasonable for the court to rule that Mr. Younger cannot call James by his given, legal name.\n\nDr. Georgulas also testified that she thinks the court can rule to forbid Mr. Younger from speaking to James about his biological make-up.\n\n\u201cI believe that is a reasonable thing for the court to find,\u201d Dr. Georgulas stated when answering the amicus attorney\u2019s question about the court being able to forbid Mr. Younger from speaking to James about his biological make-up.\n\n\u201cIt presents so many risks and it scares me,\u201d Mr. Younger said of a possible medical \u201ctransition\u201d for his son, and cited the testimony of his expert witnesses.\n\nMr. Younger\u2019s attorney was not able to call all of his side\u2019s witnesses due to time constraints. The jury heard from Dr. Geogulas\u2019 witnesses Tuesday afternoon, Wednesday, half of Thursday, and half of Friday. The jury heard from Mr. Younger\u2019s witnesses half of Thursday and this Monday morning.\n\nJudge Kim Cooks will read her ruling on possession, child support, and Dr. Georgulas\u2019 other requests at 1:30 p.m. CST on Wednesday.\n\nFollow all LifeSiteNews coverage of the James Younger case here.", "description": "Dr. Anne Georgulas revealed that twins James and Jude were created via in-vitro fertilization.", "authors": ["Madeleine Jacob"], "top_image": "https://assets.lifesitenews.com/images/made/images/remote/https_www.lifesitenews.com/images/local/save_james_1_1024_512_75_s_c1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
