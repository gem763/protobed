He had his finger on it all,\" he said.\n\nAlder said he and Wilcock started the helicopter company, E & B Helicopters, together and ran it together for about 10 years before Alder left it to focus on his other company, Sealand Aviation.\n\n\"He was the E and I was the B,\" said Alder of the company the men founded together.\n\nHe said if anyone ever wanted to get in touch with Wilcock on Christmas Day, they knew they could find him by calling the office \u2014 a testament to his work ethic.\n\nFire crews responded to the helictoper crash on the Tyee Spit in Campbell River late Tuesday morning.
