She\u2019s been so amazing. For a couple of hours she\u2019s been guiding me through the routine.\n\n\"This is a real test for her. I\u2019m just going to do my best for her and for Neil.\n\nWhile Alex added: \"He's been amazing.\"\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nNeil was ruled out of the Halloween special after picking up an injury in rehearsals.\n\nThis meant that Alex had to teach Kev her entire street commercial routine in just a matter of hours.\n\nThere was some controversy as certain viewers insisted that Gorka Marquez, who did not receive a partner this year, should have been drafted in instead.\n\n(Image: TV Grab)\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nFormer Strictly pro dancer, James Jordan, tweeted: \"Kevin to the rescue....\"\n\nMinutes later, he added: \"Shame they didn\u2019t use Gorka to step in for Neil.....\"\n\nThis was backed by lots of Strictly viewers on Twitter , as one said: \"Nothing against Kevin but I wish it was Gorka\"\n\n\"I love them both but Gorka was gutted not to have a partner this year so should of been,\" added another.\n\n(Image: TV Grab)\n\nAlex didn't let the setback ruin her routine and received high praise from all of the judges before getting a score of 34.\n\nPraising Alex after the performance, Kevin said: \"Then having to teach a to do the dance in 45 minutes. Everyone can probably see I got a few things wrong in that and Alex kept the whole thing going on her own.\"\n\nSpeaking to Claudia afterwards, Kevin admitted: \"I literally went out and blanked in the middle of the routine and got it all wrong. You carried me through, Alex.\"\n\n*Strictly Come Dancing airs tonight on BBC One at 7.15pm", "description": "Kevin Clifton stepped in for injured Neil Jones - but some Strictly Come Dancing fans argued Gorka Marques should have got the call up", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Bbc", "Tv Grab", "Bbc Guy Levy"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20737176.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Strictly-Kevin-and-Alex.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
