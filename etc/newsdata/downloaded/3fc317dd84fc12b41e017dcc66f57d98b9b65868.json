That put them in first place, but with only four seats still not accounted for, they cannot reach the full majority of 116 seats in the 230-seat assembly.\n\nThe Socialists substantially increased their score from their 86 lawmakers in 2015.\n\nCosta's minority government has received praise from Brussels and at home for combining fiscal discipline with measures to promote growth after recession and the austerity of Portugal's 2010-14 debt crisis.\n\nHe told supporters he would continue to cut the budget deficit and the debt. But that could be complicated by his potential allies' demands.\n\n\"These negotiations could be more complex than four years ago when the pact on the left was cemented by their common goal to unseat the right,\" said political scientist Antonio Costa Pinto.\n\n\"Now the left as a whole has been reinforced.\n\n\"Obviously, they will test the budgetary limits and the economic projections for the next few years,\" Costa Pinto said, expecting the negotiations to take a few weeks, now with more participants.\n\nPresident Marcelo Rebelo de Souza is likely to demand assurances from the parties that the solution would be a lasting one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNegotiations are in any case not expected to be as messy or as long as in neighbouring Spain, which still has no government more than five months after elections and is heading for a repeat vote in November.\n\nIn 2015, it took less than two months for Costa to reach a deal with leftist allies and be sworn in as prime minister.\n\nLeaders for the Left Bloc and the Communists both said they had no objections to Costa being nominated as premier and were open to negotiate if the Socialists committed to improving the lives of workers.\n\n\"There is no obstacle for the president to appoint the prime minister and for the government to be formed and start working,\" said Communist leader Jeronimo de Souza. \"We will determine our position depending on the PS' choices, on its budget instruments and the content of its legislative proposals.\"\n\nCosta has benefited from an economy that is growing more than the EU average, helped by increased exports and a booming tourism industry that last year saw visitors outnumber Portugal's inhabitants.\n\nBut a series of scandals, from a nepotism row to the alleged involvement of a former minister in an army cover-up of the theft of weapons from a military base, has hit the Socialists' ratings.\n\nThe main opposition Social Democrats (PSD) won 28 per cent of the votes and at least 77 seats, according to the preliminary results, once of their weakest results ever.\n\nAt the PS election rally, supporters stood up cheering as the exit polls were published.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We got stronger from this election and we will be able to continue with our policies,\" said 25-year-old supporter Miguel Matos.\n\nPAN attracted more votes than in the previous election, riding a wave of popularity among pro-environment parties in much of Europe to land at least four seats. But those seats are not enough for the Socialists to govern with them alone.\n\n\"It's a very good result. I still wish it was more, because the country needs to move quickly to tackle the climate emergency,\" PAN supporter Paulo Santos, 43, said at the party's evening rally.\n\nThe far-right Chega elected one lawmaker - the first time a far-right party got a seat in Portugal's parliament since the end of the dictatorship in 1974. Two other small parties got one lawmaker each for the first time.\n\nReuters", "description": "With most of the votes counted, the Socialists led with 106 seats from a 230-seat assembly.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7277%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_143/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1315c0aed3238a049d44e008bf0bdbf6ab2b6ef0", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
