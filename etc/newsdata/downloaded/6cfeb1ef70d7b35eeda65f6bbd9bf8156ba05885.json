(Tom Williams/Reuters)\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) on Tuesday endorsed President Trump\u2019s characterization of the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry as a \u201clynching.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2013 a lynching,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cBut we will WIN!\u201d\n\nThe comments prompted immediate criticism from Democrats.\n\n\u201cThat is one word that no president ought to apply to himself,\u201d House Majority Whip Tim Clyburn (D., S.C.) said in an interview on CNN.\n\nHowever, Graham stood by Trump\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cThis is a lynching in every sense. This is un-American,\u201d Graham said in response. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a situation in my lifetime as a lawyer where somebody is accused of a major misconduct who cannot confront the accuser, call witnesses on her behalf and have the discussion in the light of day so the public can judge.\u201d\n\nDemocrats leading the impeachment inquiry are investigating whether Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine to pressure the country to investigate corruption allegations against former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nGraham was asked if he could understand the offense taken by African-Americans at Trump\u2019s invocation of a historic racial injustice.\n\n\u201cYes, African Americans have [been] lynched. Other people have been lynched throughout history,\u201d Graham responded. \u201cWhat does lynching mean? That a mob grabs you, they don\u2019t give you a chance to defend yourself, they don\u2019t tell you what happened to you, they just destroy you. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening in the United States House of Representatives right now.\u201d\n\nGraham has generally been a staunch ally of President Trump throughout the impeachment process, although in a Sunday interview he did not rule out impeachment if lawmakers brought to his attention evidence of a crime committed by Trump.\n\nThe South Carolina lawmaker has also pushed back vigorously against Trump\u2019s order to withdraw American troops from northeast Syria.", "description": "Senator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) on Tuesday endorsed President Trump's characterization of the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry as a \"lynching.\"", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
