The caucuses are Feb. 3.\n\nHouse leaders plan for the first floor vote in the impeachment inquiry on Thursday, a measure that will authorize public hearings on the matter and ensure the release of deposition transcripts.\n\nAD\n\nUnder the constitutional process, the House would vote to impeach with a simple majority vote. The Senate would then hold a trial, with conviction requiring a vote of two-thirds of the senators present.\n\nAD\n\nOther strategists have argued that Trump and the Republican Party have reacted so poorly to the impeachment investigation that a drawn-out process could be beneficial to Trump\u2019s rivals.\n\n\u201cHe has been exhibiting all the behaviors that polling shows makes the voters who decide elections very nervous about him,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, who was a senior White House adviser to President Barack Obama and now co-hosts the \u201cPod Save America\u201d podcast. \u201cShort circuiting the investigation to meet an arbitrary deadline is the greater political risk than having it bleed into 2020.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Capitol Hill, interviews with more than a dozen House Democrats revealed their hope to conduct a full and complete investigation, with some expressing concern about the process extending into January.\n\n\u201cThe end of the year is the deadline still, and I certainly think it ought to happen before Iowa,\u201d said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). \u201cWhen you run against an incumbent, you have to make the case of why to fire them. The House has done that. But you also have to make the case of how you\u2019re going to improve people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOthers are focused more on the need to follow the facts.\n\n\u201cI think they should take as long as they need,\u201d said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii). \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t take any extra time. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any magic to Thanksgiving or Christmas. This is a weighty matter, and if it takes several months, so be it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has publicly sided with the latter group, even as the team she has assembled to conduct the inquiry has been moving quickly, repeatedly seeking to avoid judicial involvement that might cause months of delay in an effort to produce more documents and testimony.\n\n\u201cThe timeline will depend on the truth line,\u201d Pelosi said on Oct. 17.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) declined to speculate Tuesday about the impact on the Iowa caucuses.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t put a time frame on it. But we would like to do it as expeditiously as possible. And that will be informed by the facts, by our conclusions and where we think we need to go,\u201d Hoyer told reporters.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly tried to use time as a weapon to get the upper hand in proceedings. Trump and his staff have refused requests for documents and demanded that current and former officials decline House requests for documents.\n\nLast week, House Republicans tried to disrupt the investigative work, with members storming and delaying a closed-door witness interview.\n\nSo far, the Democratic National Committee and the top presidential campaigns have not weighed in on the timing debate, both because they do not want to politicize the process and because it is difficult to game out just what an extended process would mean, officials said.\n\nSeveral senators running for president, including Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a former state prosecutor, are likely to try to use a trial of Trump as a showcase for their candidacy. But the trial could also remove them from the campaign trail in early states such as Iowa and New Hampshire just weeks before the vote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have been in uncharted territory for so long, who knows? It could distinguish people, or it could complicate things,\u201d said a top official with one of the Democratic campaigns, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy.\n\nSome in the Senate have weighed in on a separate debate over expanding the scope of the investigation, another decision that could extend the reach of the process.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to get it done, get the information you need and move on,\u201d said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), the former chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \u201cThey just got to stay focused on Ukraine, get the information, and then hopefully come to some sort of [decision on] whether they\u2019re going to send it over here.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe said time was a factor, though not a decisive one.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s important that they do their job in a very timely manner \u2014 whether it\u2019s done by the end of the year or not, I can\u2019t say,\u201d Tester said. \u201cI would prefer it, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a killer or not.\u201d\n\nAnother group, including Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), have echoed Pelosi in pushing back against an artificial timeline.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard we need to be done before Thanksgiving, that it needs to be done before Christmas, that it needs to be done before the first primary \u2014 it needs to be done when it\u2019s done,\u201d said House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.). \u201cThis has to be a dignified process and a process the American people respect.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHanging over the entire discussion is an awareness of the political nature of impeachment. Though the proceedings have so far been held mostly behind closed doors, leaders of both parties are closely tracking public opinion polls, which have shown a clear growth in support for both an impeachment investigation and Trump\u2019s removal since September.\n\nAD\n\nA Washington Post-Schar School poll in early October found 58 percent of Americans supported opening the inquiry, while 49 percent supported recommending Trump\u2019s removal from office. A CNN poll taken between Oct. 17 and 20 similarly found that 50 percent supported removing him from office.\n\nThe strong support for impeachment could put pressure on vulnerable Republican members of the Senate, including Sen. Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Sen. Martha McSally (Ariz.), who have recently signed on to a bill that condemns the House impeachment process.\n\nSome Democratic strategists are hopeful a more extended impeachment proceeding will make it easier for their Democratic rivals to make the case that the GOP incumbents are more focused on defending Trump than on working for their state.\n\nBut other Democrats worry the same arguments could be made against their own presidential candidates, who have built campaigns around providing more support for middle-class families and new health insurance options.\n\n\u201cThis whole impeachment conversation \u2014 you look at cable news and whatever \u2014 is overshadowing the actual presidential race,\u201d said Rep. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.). \u201cSo I think there are some people who say, \u2018Look, you know, we have to have space for the presidential campaigns to play out.\u2019 \u201d", "description": "A January trial in the Senate would force Democratic senators to remain in Washington while Biden, Buttigieg and others campaign in Iowa ahead of the Feb. 3 caucuses.", "authors": ["Michael Scherer", "National Political Reporter Covering Campaigns", "Congress", "The White House", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-XCMiKysumNbBsu_VRFm7OBeMDw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PF25PHH2REI6TAMQNPSN5NLOAE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
