Screenshots of his remark, which was later deleted, were posted on the Waterloo Community School District Facebook page, according to the newspaper.\n\nScreen Shot/Facebook\n\nParents emphasized to a local news station that Baish made the threatening comment about a child the same age as students he teaches. That means students can enter a classroom \u201cwhere they don\u2019t feel safe, where they don\u2019t feel they can share their opinion, where they don\u2019t feel respected\u201d said one mother (see the video above). \u201cWe as parents have to stand up against that.\u201d\n\nParents, teachers and students at Waterloo West High School received an email from Waterloo Community School District officials Friday about Baish being placed on administrative leave.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of a social media situation involving one of our employees,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe nature of the content shared rose to the level of putting this employee on administrative leave pending an investigation. We appreciate your patience as we sort through the details and thank you for respecting the process.\u201d\n\nA police spokesman told the Des Moines Register that law enforcement is also investigating Baish.\n\nBaish could not be reached for comment.\n\nWaterloo Schools\u2019 social media policies warn staff to \u201cthink twice before posting\u201d and advise not to post or approve comments that include \u201cthreats of physical or bodily harm.\u201d\n\nThunberg joined more than 3,000 activists at a \u201cclimate strike\u201d Friday in Iowa City. Demonstrators demanded that the University of Iowa and the city agree to a climate accord which calls for both entities to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2030 \u2014 and demands the university to cease burning coal at its power plant.", "description": "A high school science teacher's frightening Facebook remark was forwarded to school district officials.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9aa8812100002a0432a868.jpeg?cache=c2kwewebti&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
