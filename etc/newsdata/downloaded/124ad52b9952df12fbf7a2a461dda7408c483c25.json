Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough\u2019s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families.

Amazon Prime 25/38 Years and Years \"Years and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views.

Villanelle\u2019s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle\u2019s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-they/won\u2019t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.\" BBC/BBC America 27/38 Chernobyl \"Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.\" HBO 28/38 The Handmaid's Tale \"Season three's knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.\" Hulu 29/38 This Way Up \"The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.\" Channel 4 30/38 Jade: The Reality Star Who Changed Britain \"A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.\" Channel 4 31/38 Succession \"Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all.
