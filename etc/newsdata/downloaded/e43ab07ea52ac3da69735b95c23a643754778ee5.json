Put simply, the bank would effectively pay customers to borrow money. It\u2019s a bit more complicated than that, however, as borrowers have to pay fees that offset the savings.\n\nThe news got loads of attention, as people struggled to wrap their heads around being paid for something they are supposed to be purchasing. Consumers around the world wanted in on the action.\n\nThe weekend following the negative mortgages announcement, Jyske Bank received 80-90 inquiries from Americans who wanted these viral mortgages.\n\nIt\u2019s all been rather amusing for Jyske Bank and its housing economist Mikkel H\u00f8egh, who has had to deal with all the attention.\n\n\u201cWhat I have said to the Americans is that they have to have a Danish property to get such a loan,\u201d H\u00f8egh told Yahoo Finance in an email. \u201cSome of the Americans then asked if I could help them buying a property in Denmark. I can\u2019t with that but we can help them with the funding if they get the house.\u201d\n\nJyske Bank has had to do a lot of clarifying; there\u2019s a widespread misconception that the bank is actually paying borrowers to take their money. First of all, the bank is not actually paying anyone; it is simply forgiving part of the loan each time a payment is made. A mortgage borrower is likely to end up paying Jyske back a little more than they borrowed, factoring in fees and charges associated with arranging the mortgage loan.\n\nAnd the bank can afford to do this without losing money because it borrows at negative interest rates as well.\n\n\u201cThe experience has been quite good,\u201d H\u00f8egh told Yahoo Finance in an email. \u201cMany people like to hear about the loans and apply for them.\u201d H\u00f8egh added that the country was amidst a historic refinancing of mortgages. Mortgage debt in Denmark increased in 88 of 98 municipalities, according to Denmark\u2019s national bank, with most customers choosing fixed rates.\n\nThough only Denmark has done this so far, the German Bundesbank has indicated that these loans would also be \u201cconceivable\u201d and wouldn\u2019t be against them, according to the Stuttgarter Zeitung and Bloomberg.\n\nHow it works\n\nDenmark has had low interest rates for a long time, and the country\u2019s banking system has a closer than normal relationship between borrowers and investors, facilitated by banks.\n\nBecause interest rates have gone down and the prices of mortgage bonds have gone up for investors, those rates can be passed on to borrowers \u2014 creating negative mortgages if they\u2019re low enough.\n\nThe fact that banks and investors are willing to invest with negative returns is not necessarily a good thing, because it shows they would rather take a small loss than lose more elsewhere, because they view the economy as less-than-healthy. Though negative interest rates aren\u2019t new in Europe, they are breaking new ground, from these types of mortgages to Germany selling a negative-yielding 30-year bond for the first time in August.\n\nDespite being in \u201chistoric remortgaging,\u201d H\u00f8egh said the negative interest rates don\u2019t actually make it any easier for home buyers to get a loan, but makes it easier to get a bigger loan \u2013 a lower rate means a higher disposable budget.\n\n\u201cPeople find the new loans very attractive, but I don\u2019t think that it is a big surprise for them,\u201d said H\u00f8egh. \u201cThe most surprising thing is that de-link between the real estate prices and the interest rate is in these years less significant.\u201d\n\nJyske Bank's graph showing the amount of new loans over time.
