In less than a month, the campaign collected 40 times that amount.\n\nD'Amico, McClure and Bobbitt did numerous newspaper and television interviews, posed for photos together, revisited the spot where they claimed their first encounter happened and went on Good Morning America' to share the heartwarming tale.\n\nAuthorities began investigating after Bobbitt sued the couple for allegedly not giving him the money.\n\nIn announcing criminal charges last November, Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina said almost no part of the tale was true and that instead, the group met near a Philadelphia casino in October 2017 shortly before they spun their sob story.\n\nThe trio ended up collecting more than $400,000 from 14,000 donors on GoFundMe, claiming the money was intended for Bobbitt\n\nBobbitt and McClure have pleaded guilty to federal and state crimes. D'Amico has pleaded not guilty to all counts against him\n\nBobbitt, 36, and McClure, 29, have both pleaded guilty to federal and state crimes. McClure faces four years in state prison and must help repay the $400,000 to 14,000 duped donors.\n\nAs part of her plea deal, McClure must also testify against D'Amico. Her federal sentencing currently is scheduled for November.\n\nBobbitt, a homeless military veteran, was sentenced in April to five years' probation in state court and agreed to help repay the money. His federal sentencing is scheduled for later this month.\n\nAuthorities have alleged D'Amico was the ringleader and concocted the story. The federal criminal complaint released Thursday alleged all of the money raised in the GoFundMe campaign was spent by March 2018, with large chunks spent by McClure and D\u00b4Amico on an RV, a used BMW and numerous trips to casinos in Las Vegas and New Jersey for gambling purposes.\n\nBobbitt (left) was sentenced in April to five years' probation in state court and agreed to help repay the money. McClure has agreed to testify against D'Amico as part of her plea deal\n\nIf found guilty of both federal charges, D'Amico faces up to 30 years in prison and fines totaling as much as $500,000.\n\nDuring his initial appearance in federal court on Thursday, D'Amico pleaded not guilty to the new charges and had a $100,000 unsecured bond set, which requires him to pay no money as long as he shows up for future hearings and complies with the conditions of his release.\n\nA judge ordered D'Amico to turn in his passport, prohibited him from leaving New Jersey without permission and barred him from contacting any witnesses or victims in this case.", "description": "Mark D'Amico, 40, was charged on Thursday with federal counts of\u00a0wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy stemming from the 2017 ruse involving Johnny Bobbitt.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Snejana Farberov For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/19/19309114-0-image-a-12_1570213885875.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
