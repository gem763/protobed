REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n\nThe 15-member council agreed to the brief statement after meeting for the second time behind closed doors since the Turkish operation began. The offensive has forced tens of thousands of civilians to flee and raised doubt about the fate of thousands of Islamic State fighters in Kurdish jails.\n\nThe council said nothing on northeast Syria after it met last Thursday. Council statements are agreed by consensus and Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said at the time the council \u201cshould take into account other aspects of the Syrian crisis not just the Turkish operation.\u201d\n\nAfter Wednesday\u2019s meeting the United States, China and the council\u2019s five European members - Britain, France, Germany, Poland and Belgium - all separately called on Turkey to halt its attack, but the Security Council statement did not.\n\n\u201cChina calls for the immediate end of military actions by Turkey,\u201d China\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun told reporters. \u201cThe Security Council discussions, in one way or another, are still going on so let\u2019s work toward the right solution.\u201d\n\nNebenzia said that the Security Council did not discuss calling for a ceasefire in northeast Syria. Syrian ally Russia has vetoed 13 Security Council resolutions since the Syrian war began in 2011 and has long called for the United States to withdraw its forces from Syria.\n\n\u201cThe Turkish side tells us that they will respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria,\u201d Nebenzia told reporters. \u201cWe understand the Turkish national security concerns but we believe that the operation that they\u2019re conducting should be proportionate to the aims that they declare.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish assault forced the United States to pull its forces out of northern Syria. Syrian government forces, backed by Washington\u2019s adversaries Russia and Iran, have swiftly advanced into territory formerly patrolled by U.S. troops.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft said Washington called on Turkey to \u201ccease undermining the campaign to defeat ISIS, cease endangering civilians ... cease its offensive and declare a ceasefire immediately.\u201d\n\nA crackdown by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on pro-democracy protesters in 2011 led to civil war. Islamic State, sometimes called ISIS or ISIL, used the chaos to seize territory in Syria and Iraq. The United States led a coalition in Syria to oust Islamic State.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council \u201cexpressed deep concern over the risk of the dispersion of terrorists from U.N.-designated groups, including ISIL, and are also very concerned over the risk of a further deterioration of the humanitarian situation.\u201d\n\nTurkey has justified its action under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, which covers an individual or collective right to self-defense against armed attack. It told the Council in a letter last week that its military operation in northern Syria would be \u201cproportionate, measured and responsible.\u201d", "description": "The United Nations Security Council voiced concern on Wednesday over the risks of a deterioration in the humanitarian situation in northeast Syria and the escape of Islamic State fighters, but made no reference to a Turkish assault on U.S.-allied Syrian Kurdish militia that began a week ago.", "authors": ["Michelle Nichols", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441577542&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0RE", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
