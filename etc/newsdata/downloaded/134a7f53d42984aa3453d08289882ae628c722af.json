For them to achieve this is a great thing for us and for the nation,\u201d he added.\n\nPNG\u2019s automatic qualification came at the expense of the Netherlands, who defeated Scotland but will have to take the playoffs route to reach Australia.\n\nCricket was introduced into PNG in the early 1900s by British missionaries but the national teams have struggled to make an impression on the world stage until recently.\n\nThe men\u2019s \u201cBarramundis\u201d team were awarded One Day International Status by the ICC in 2014 and they have benefited from development grants from neighbouring cricket power Australia.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Papua New Guinea have qualified for their first Men\u2019s T20 World Cup in 2020 is one of modern cricket\u2019s amazing feel good stories,\u201d commentator and former West Indies fast bowler Ian Bishop tweeted.\n\nIndia spinner Ravichandran Ashwin also hailed PNG\u2019s entry to one of cricket\u2019s biggest global stages.\n\n\u201cSo PNG qualifies for the T20 World Cup!! It\u2019s amazing to see the game expanding globally and will surely bring more young ones to play the great game,\u201d he tweeted.", "description": "Global cricketers hailed one of the sport's \"feel good\" stories of the year on Monday after Papua New Guinea dug themselves out of a huge hole at a Dubai qualifier to book their maiden appearance at the T20 World Cup in Australia next year.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
