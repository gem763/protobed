His most notable runs were a 36-yarder on the opening drive, a 21-yard score and a 16-yard foray up the middle on a third-and-14 in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cI want to win. If I have to run, I do it,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cToday, that\u2019s what it was. Sometimes I had to pass, sometimes I had to run.\u201d\n\nRegardless of where Jackson went, the Bengals (0-6) were usually a step behind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard because you got all your skill guys covering down the field, eyes on their man,\u201d safety Jesse Bates said. \u201cAnd then you got the D-line, and they\u2019re just rushing against basically a running back. It\u2019s pretty tough.\u201d\n\nThe Bengals (0-6) aren\u2019t the only team to struggle against Jackson, although they\u2019ve had their fair share of problems against the 2016 Heisman Trophy winner.\n\nJackson now has three career 100-yard rushing games, tied with Billy Kilmer for most by a quarterback in his first two seasons since 1950. Jackson\u2019s first 100-yard game came last November against Cincinnati, in his first NFL start.\n\nIn this one, Jackson avoided trouble when possible but also took a few hard hits when forced to stay between the hash marks. Each time, he popped up with enthusiasm, ready to do it again.\n\n\u201cThe most frustrating thing for the defense is, you got the play covered - and he just finds (space),\u201d Bengals coach Zac Taylor said. \u201cHe\u2019s an elite athlete. We\u2019ve played a couple good athletes, (but) he\u2019s one of the rarest I\u2019ve ever seen in person. Just one little crease and he\u2019s got 30 yards on you.\u201d\n\nJackson became the first quarterback in the Super Bowl era to pass for at least 200 yards and rush for 150 in a single game. Tapering off his downfield runs at the end, Jackson finished tantalizingly short of Michael Vick\u2019s single-game record of 173 yards rushing by a quarterback.\n\n\u201cHaving your name mentioned with his is pretty cool,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nNot that placing his name in the NFL record book is all that important for Jackson.\n\n\u201cTo his credit, he\u2019s all about winning the game,\u201d Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. \u201cSetting records is not what he\u2019s thinking about now.\u201d\n\nJackson was also adept when throwing, going 21 for 33 without an interception. But on this day, his legs counted most.\n\n\u201cLamar was able to get out and run because of the way they were playing,\u201d Harbaugh said.\n\nCincinnati jumped on top when Brandon Wilson took the opening kickoff 92 yards for a score, but Jackson responded quickly. Baltimore (4-2) finished with 497 yards of offense, and the Ravens retained sole possession of first place in the AFC North.\n\nThe Bengals, meanwhile, remain in search of their first win under Taylor.\n\nAndy Dalton went 21 for 39 for 235 yards and scored on a 2-yard run with 1:28 left. But Cincinnati failed to a produce an offensive touchdown over the first three quarters in a third straight game.\n\nBaltimore compiled a 212-6 advantage in yardage and an 11-0 margin in first downs during the first quarter. Jackson led the way with 106 yards through the air and 85 on the ground.\n\nThe Ravens scored touchdowns on each of their first two possessions, a 21-yard run by Jackson and a 1-yard plunge by Mark Ingram. The quarter ended just before Justin Tucker kicked a 40-yard field goal for a 17-7 lead.\n\nLate in the half, the Bengals moved to the Baltimore 21 before Marlon Humphrey intercepted a deflected pass. The Ravens gave it back when tight end Mark Andrews fumbled while trying to hurdle a defender, and Cincinnati cashed in with a field goal.\n\nRARE OCCURRENCE\n\nWilson\u2019s kickoff return for a touchdown was only the 11th allowed by the Ravens in their existence, and the first since Joe McKnight of the Jets went 107 yards on Oct. 3, 2011. It was also the first opening kick TD in the NFL since Pharoh Cooper\u2019s 103-yarder for the Rams against the Jaguars on Oct. 15, 2017. Finally, it was the first by Cincinnati since Bernard Scott against Pittsburgh in 2009.\n\nINJURIES\n\nBengals: CB Dre Kirkpatrick (knee) was carted off in the first quarter and did not return. \u2026 G John Miller left in the second quarter with a groin injury. He did not return. \u2026 OT Cordy Glenn (concussion) was inactive for the sixth consecutive week.\n\nRavens: Rookie WR Marquise Brown and MLB Patrick Onwuasor, the team\u2019s leading tackler, were inactive with ankle injuries.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBengals: Cincinnati takes another shot at getting its first victory next Sunday in a home matchup with Jacksonville.\n\nRavens: Baltimore faces the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday, the first meeting between the teams on the West Coast since 2011.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Lamar Jackson presented the Cincinnati Bengals with a can't-win dilemma: Try to prevent the versatile quarterback from running, or stop him from passing?", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Ginsburg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/bengals_ravens_football_61753_c0-0-3238-1888_s1200x700.jpg?dae2e662efd43d16c26f443edc280463ef5f2afc", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
