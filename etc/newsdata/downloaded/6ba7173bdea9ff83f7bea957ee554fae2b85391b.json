Users will also be able to submit Siri data deletion requests in the near future as well. These new features have been appearing in the latest round of OS updates for Apple devices and should be reaching the public soon.\n\nIt\u2019s good to see Apple responding to recent criticism over letting employees use recorded Siri interactions to help develop new features and fine-tune the AI assistant\u2019s accuracy. While Apple handled this data with more finesse and security than other companies, it was basically impossible to opt-out of the program without completely disabling Siri and deleting your entire command history\u2014but the upcoming iOS 13.2, iPadOS 13.2, MacOS 10.15.1, tvOs 13.2, and WatchOS 6.1 updates will all include the new opt-out and deletion requests for your Siri data.\n\nBetter yet, you can get the features early by enrolling your device(s) into to Apple OS beta program. Once you do, here\u2019s how you can start opting-out of the audio reviews:\n\nOpt-in or out of the Siri audio review program\n\nGo to Settings > Privacy > Analytics. Disable \u201cImprove Siri and Dictation.\u201d This will remove you from the clip review program; enabling the setting will opt you back in.\n\nIf you decide to let Apple review your Siri clips, Apple stresses that only Apple employees\u2014not third-party contractors\u2014will have access to the clips. Those who opt-out may still have their commands reviewed, but only in the form of computer-generated and fully anonymised text transcripts. You\u2019ll find a full explanation of how your Siri data is used by going to Settings > Privacy > Analytics and Improvements > About Siri.\n\nDelete Siri command history\n\nAs for wiping you Siri history, you can now make deletion requests by going to Settings > Siri and Search > Siri History. Those who don\u2019t want to fully opt-out of the audio review program for whatever reason should take note of this feature, since deleting Siri data within 24 hours of making a command will prevent it from being used by Apple to improve Siri.", "description": "Apple has started rolling out new options for managing Siri data\u2014most importantly the ability to opt-out of having Siri audio clips reviewed by Apple employees.
