Wochit, Wochit\n\nALVARADO, Texas \u2013 U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, the former Texas governor who has faced scrutiny over President Donald Trump's interactions with Ukraine, has resigned.\n\nPerry reportedly informed the president on Thursday as the two flew together on Air Force One to Texas, where Trump is holding several events, including a political rally in Dallas. The president confirmed the news while traveling in the state.\n\n\"We already have his replacement. Rick has done a fantastic job. But it was time,\" Trump told reporters, adding that Perry will stay on until the end of the year.\n\nA member of Trump's original Cabinet, Perry has come under scrutiny amid the ongoing impeachment inquiry into whether Trump abused his office by pressuring Ukraine to help to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, one of his top political rivals.\n\nPerry was subpoenaed last week in the inquiry. House Democrats have demanded he turn over documents related to Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump pushed for an investigation of Biden and Biden's son Hunter, who once had business interests in Ukraine.\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry gestures as he arrives on Air Force One with President Donald Trump at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base in Fort Worth, Texas, Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019.

As Trump was planning his first trip to the border of his candidacy, Perry slammed the former reality TV host turned presidential candidate.\n\n\"He offers a carnival act that can best be described as Trumpism,\" Perry said in a July 2015 speech. \"A toxic mix of demagoguery and mean-spiritedness and nonsense that will lead the Republican Party to perdition.\n\n\"Let no one be mistaken: Donald Trump's candidacy is a cancer on conservatism.\"\n\nBut Perry ultimately set aside his earlier misgivings and backed Trump in the general election.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/17/rick-perry-resigns-trumps-energy-secretary-amid-ukraine-probe/4012381002/", "description": "Energy Secretary Rick Perry, the former Texas governor who has faced scrutiny over President Donald Trump's interactions with Ukraine, has resigned.", "authors": ["John Fritze", "Courtney Subramanian", "Nicholas Wu", "John C Moritz Austin Bureau Usa Today Network", "Published P.M.
