Seemingly it\u2019s deeply invested in getting you to fuck your friends! You can start screaming now, or in unison with me as I read through their announcement post.\n\nToday, we\u2019re launching Facebook Dating in the US. We\u2019re also giving people the ability to integrate their Instagram posts directly into their Facebook Dating profile [...] By the end of the year, we\u2019ll make it possible to add Facebook and Instagram Stories to your Dating profile too.\n\nOh god. Oh no. Please do not do this.\n\nPeople are suggested based on your preferences, interests and other things you do on Facebook\n\nThat\u2019s awfully vague. Is now a good time to start worrying, or is it already too late?\n\nWith one tap, we\u2019ll suggest photos and information from your Facebook profile, which you can edit or remove. You can also create your own Dating profile from scratch.\n\nJust imagine Mark Zuckerberg personally suggesting adding a photo where you \u201clook exceptionally fertile.\u201d\n\nIf you are interested in someone, you can comment directly on their profile or tap on the Like button to let them know. If you aren\u2019t interested, you can pass on them. Facebook Dating allows you to match with friends of friends and/or people not in your friend circle. Facebook Dating won\u2019t match you with friends, unless you choose to use Secret Crush and you both add each other to your list.\n\n... so that you can feel weird around one another until you stop hanging out entirely, forever!\n\nYou can choose to see other people who are using Facebook Dating that fit your preferences within the groups you are part of and the events you have attended or will be attending.\n\nAHHHHHHHHHHH\n\nWe\u2019re committed to protecting people\u2019s privacy within Facebook Dating so that we can create a place where people feel comfortable looking for a date and starting meaningful relationships.\n\nAnd why would we ever have a reason to doubt them?", "description": "Facebook \u2014 a company that knows everything about you \u2014 is a dating platform now.
