According to local news station CBS4, Turner said her daughter had neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy, a degenerative disease of the internal organs.\n\nHowever, an indictment released on Monday accuses Turner of murdering her daughter, according to 9 News. 9 News say that Turner faces two counts of first-degree murder.\n\nIt notes that the charges are \"one alleging she killed Olivia while in a position of trust, one alleging she killed the girl after deliberation.\"\n\nDuring the course of her daughter's illness Turner raised multiple funds for her including an $11,000 grant from the Make-A-Wish Foundation, an organisation granting \"wishes\" to terminally ill children, according to the same indictment, as cited by Channel 9news.\n\nRead more: A court has heard how a couple who murdered a young woman and burned her body were afflicted by a 'folie \u00e0 deux' \u2014 here's what it means\n\nA still taken from a local news interview with Kelly Turner while her daughter Olivia was still alive.
