(Q3 report)\n\nTesla also reported better-than-expected free cash flow (FCF) of $371 million. And it forecast that it would be GAAP profitable and cash-flow positive going forward, albeit (in classic Tesla fashion) with \"possible temporary exceptions, particularly around the launch and ramp of new products.\" The company hadn't shared a profit or cash-flow outlook in its Q3 deliveries report, which arrived earlier this month.\n\nThe improvement seen in Tesla's automotive gross margin (GM) is getting a lot of attention, given how this figure has been pressured in recent quarters by a mix shift towards cheaper versions of the Model 3. Excluding government credits, automotive GM was 20.8%, down from a year-ago level of 23.4% but well above a Q2 level of 16.8%.\n\nAlso boosting Tesla's EPS and FCF: GAAP operating expenses fell 16% annually to $1.09 billion, as job cuts and a sales model change made itself felt.\n\nTesla did once more use some creative wordplay to change its deliveries guidance. Whereas the company previously said it's aiming for 360,000 to 400,000 2019 deliveries, it now says it's \"highly confident\" that it will top 360,000 deliveries.\n\nOn the flip side, Tesla says it now expects to start volume production for its relatively cheap Model Y crossover by the summer of 2020, after having previously forecast a fall 2020 start. The company also says its Shanghai Gigafactory has begun making vehicles on a trial basis, and is working to get the government approvals needed to start volume production.\n\nOverall, Tesla's Q3 report does a lot to calm investors worries (heightened in July by a weak Q2 report) about the company's ability to be profitable and cash-flow positive while selling large numbers of cars for around $40,000 or less. And over time, greater manufacturing efficiencies and lower battery costs should make this feat easier.\n\nThat said, with Tesla currently sporting an enterprise value (market cap plus net debt) of around $61 billion, the stock is already pricing in further financial improvement, as well as meaningful top-line growth.\n\nLam Research\n\nLam, a top-3 chip equipment maker, beat EPS estimates while reporting roughly in-line revenue. More importantly, it issued a strong December quarter outlook, with revenue guidance of $2.35 billion to $2.65 billion comfortably above a consensus estimate of $2.19 billion. (September quarter report)\n\nWith Lam having posted revenue of $2.53 billion during its December 2018 quarter, the outlook raises the possibility that Lam, which like its peers has been hit hard this year by weak demand from memory makers, could see annual revenue growth for the first time in 18 months.\n\nLam's earnings call commentary was also encouraging -- both for itself and for peers such as Applied Materials (AMAT) and KLA (KLAC) . Whereas Lam previously forecast industry wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending would drop by a mid-to-high teens percentage this year -- an outlook that implied spending in the low-$40s billion dollar range -- it now expects spending to be in the mid-$40s billion dollar range.\n\nNot surprisingly, given the big capex guidance hike that Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) revealed last week as well as recent reports of Intel (INTC) PC CPU supply constraints, Lam indicated that strong demand from foundry (chip contract manufacturer) and logic (processor) clients was driving the recent strength it's seeing. Lam also asserted that it's gaining share with these clients.\n\nLam's commentary about demand from DRAM was more tempered. The company noted that server CPU upgrade cycles and 5G phone launches will boost DRAM demand, but nonetheless predicted the DRAM industry's inventory levels (currently elevated) wouldn't normalize until the second half of 2020. It was a little more positive about the NAND flash memory market, noting that the supply/demand balance is already improving and forecasting that inventories would normalize during the first half of 2020.\n\nLam is now up 92% on the year. With shares now trading for close to 15 times what Lam earned in fiscal 2018, before orders from memory clients tumbled, the stock doesn't have the kind of rock-bottom valuation it possessed in late 2018 and early 2019. But it doesn't exactly sport nosebleed multiples either.\n\nTwitter", "description": "Tesla and Lam Research are soaring post-earnings, while Twitter is doing the opposite.
