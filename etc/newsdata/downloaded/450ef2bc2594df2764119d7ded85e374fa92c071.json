Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) responded on Sunday to remarks from a 9/11 victim\u2019s son who criticized the congresswoman during the 18th anniversary of the terror attacks last week.\n\nOmar was met with backlash from conservatives after stating in a speech earlier this year that \u201csome people did something\u201d that day, a line that was taken out of context by her opponents \u2015 including President Donald Trump \u2015 who used it to claim she was downplaying the significance of the event.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nicholas Haros Jr., who lost his mother, Frances, at the World Trade Center, wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the phrase, invoking Omar\u2019s comments, which he appeared to have found offensive.\n\nDuring a Sunday appearance on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Omar offered empathy for Haros while emphasizing the meaning behind her remarks.\n\n\u201cI certainly could not understand the weight of the pain that the victims ... the families of 9/11 must feel,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think it is really important for us to make sure that we are not forgetting the aftermath of what happened after 9/11. Many Americans found themselves now having their civil rights stripped from them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI certainly could not understand the weight of the pain that the victims of the families of 9/11 must feel,\u201d @IlhanMN says, but she adds, we should also remember that many Americans had \u201ctheir civil rights stripped from them\u201d in the wake of the attacks. https://t.co/GXCetaYIsi pic.twitter.com/pG18aMn4Ea \u2014 Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) September 15, 2019\n\nContinuing, Omar noted that her comments, which were made during a Council on American-Islamic Relations gathering in March, were intended to point out that the attacks had resulted in intensified suspicion of the Muslim community as a whole, despite the fact that the violence was perpetrated by a small number of individuals.\n\n\u201cAnd so what I was speaking to was the fact that as a Muslim, not only was I suffering as an American who was attacked on that day, but the next day I woke up as my fellow Americans were now treating me a suspect,\u201d she added.\n\nAt the Ground Zero memorial service to honor 9/11 victims, Haros took aim at Omar\u2019s past remarks, stating, \u201cToday I am here to respond to you exactly who did what to whom.\u201d\n\n\u201cMadam, objectively speaking, we know who and what was done,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no uncertainly about that. Why your confusion?\u201d\n\nDespite the scrutiny, Omar said on Sunday that she feels her place in Washington is to initiate \u201ca conversation that others weren\u2019t having\u201d and speak \u201cfor people who felt voiceless for a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think it\u2019s really important for us to recognize that it\u2019s a new Congress. It\u2019s a diverse Congress and we\u2019re not only diverse in our race or ethnicity or religion, but we are also diverse in our perspective, in our pain and our struggles, and in the hopes and dreams that we have, and the kind of America that we want to shape for all of us.\u201d", "description": "Nicholas Haros Jr., who lost his mother at the World Trade Center, attacked the congresswoman over past remarks that were widely taken out of context.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7ec3e8230000580554b1cb.jpeg?cache=d1iodr6ufi&ops=1778_1000"}
