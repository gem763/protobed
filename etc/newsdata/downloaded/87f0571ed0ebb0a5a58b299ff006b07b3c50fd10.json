Add Immigration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Immigration news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not Nazis,\u201d he said in a wide-ranging interview this week, referencing comparisons from Democrats who've described migrant detention centers as \u201cconcentration camps.\u201d\n\nThe plea by acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Matthew Albence is likely to solicit pushback. Critics say his agency\u2019s tactics have grown increasingly aggressive, including one incident in which ICE officers smashed the window of a car with a man sitting inside with his young children. He was dragged out and arrested, then deported. Agency officials said the force was justified because the man had previously been deported and had reentered the U.S. \u2013 a felony.\n\nBut Albence insists that not enough is being done to tell the side of the agents who are responsible for enforcing President Donald Trump's most controversial immigration policies.\n\nThe comments drew a contrast with Trump\u2019s approach to the immigration debate. Trump has declared a \u201cwar\u201d on illegal migration and in June said ICE would start targeting \u201cmillions\u201d of undocumented immigrants.\n\nNext week ICE will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States. They will be removed as fast as they come in. Mexico, using their strong immigration laws, is doing a very good job of stopping people....... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2019\n\nDespite the threats, ICE has not hit the record number of annual removals made during the Obama administration. Those numbers hit a peak in 2011 when the agency removed more than 400,000 people from the country. Under Trump, fewer than 260,000 were removed in the first full budget year of his presidency.\n\nTo explain these results, Albence pointed to the changing demographics of more recent border crossers, noting that the Central American families crossing in record numbers over the past year are more difficult to deport than single adult men from Mexico.\n\nHe also said a lack of cooperation from state and local law enforcement was to blame.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the politics of this have gotten so bad that they would rather put these politics over public safety,\u201d Albence said.\n\nWhen Trump announced earlier this year he would take a \u201ctougher\u201d approach in immigration enforcement, some local police chiefs spoke out against the move. They argued that Trump\u2019s public shows of force to create deterrent effects for border crossers can make immigrant communities fearful, putting obstacles in the way of fighting local crime.\n\nAlbence rejected the idea that his agency was responsible for instilling fear in any way.\n\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t think I have to address the fear,\u201d Albence told ABC News. \u201cIf you are here in this country illegally you are subject to arrest and, if ordered removed by an immigration judge, removal from this country. That hasn't changed.\u201d\n\nAlbence also blamed those stagnant laws and congressional inaction for the dilemma his agency faces in attempting to detain more families and children long-term. Currently the agency has a capacity to hold a maximum 3,000 family members with two detention centers in Texas and Pennsylvania.\n\nBorder Patrol has been forced to release tens of thousands of family members since the migration influx started putting major strains on holding cells back in March.\n\nAnd while the Trump administration continues to litigate its recent move to lift detention limits on families and children, Albence insisted that indefinite detention is not on the table.\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as indefinite detention,\u201d Albence argued. \u201cWhen individuals are in our custody just as if they're arrested for a criminal violation. There is a process that they are going through.\u201d\n\nAs the administration continues to take aggressive action, the enforcement push has been complicated by a thorough shake-up of Trump\u2019s Homeland Security agency earlier this year. Albence took over the top job at ICE in June. His predecessor, Mark Morgan, had the job less than two months before transitioning to acting chief of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe heads of all three domestic immigration agencies - ICE, CBP, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services - agencies currently work in an \u201cacting\u201d capacity.\n\nAlbence, who has made a career in immigration enforcement, said he\u2019s not interested in becoming the agency\u2019s permanent director.", "description": "ICE Acting Director Matthew Albence says fervent political activism put his front-line agents at risk.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/albence-abc-jt-190918_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
