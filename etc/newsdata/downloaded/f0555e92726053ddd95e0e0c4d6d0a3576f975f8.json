What better way to test the waters than as a featured speaker at a political gathering in Nashville?\n\nThe fifth annual Politicon brought together political junkies from all stripes for what is nicknamed \u201cComic-Con of politics.\u201d Simon Sidi, a former rock concert producer, organizes the event as he would a festival \u2013 a mix of political celebrities, public figures, and media personalities for panel discussions, interviews, and speeches. The two-day event is a mix of politics and entertainment. Franken was a headliner Saturday night.\n\nThe event works to further obfuscate the already ambiguous line between politics and entertainment and to embrace the full-on spectacle of politics. Sidi encourages fans to come see their \u201cheroes\u201d and \u201cvillains\u201d duke it out on stage. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly like a festival,\u201d he told Fortune. \u201cI don\u2019t come from a political world, I come from live entertainment and have been a political nerd for years. What we\u2019re doing is pleasing ourselves, there\u2019s no agenda we don\u2019t expect people to sing \u2018Kumbaya\u2019 at the end. It seemed pretty obvious, and yet no one was doing it.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not the Aspen Ideas Festival,\u201d said Sidi. \u201cWe\u2019re here for people who want to enjoy politics, which can sometimes be a bit of a pill.\u201d\n\nFranken, who resigned from office after accusations of inappropriate touching and sexual misbehavior surfaced from several women, used the opportunity as a part of his \u201credemption tour\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe president is an entertainer who won by exploiting the divisions in our country and spent his presidency dividing us more day after day. Anxious Americans on both sides have turned to the news and become more invested in one side or the other,\u201d Franken said. \u201cThis weekend, political junkies will get to see and listen to some of their favorite and least favorite politicos, looking for drama, laughs, and maybe, maybe, some spectacle.\u201d\n\nFranken told those in attendance that he\u2019s out of office but he still plans to speak his mind or something.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of you might be wondering what I\u2019ve been up to,\u201d Franken said at the event, which some nickname the \u201cComic-Con of politics.\u201d \u201cWell, when I left the Senate, I said that I was giving up my seat, but I wasn\u2019t going to give up my voice \u2026 and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about how to do that and how to best make a difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn Evening with Al Franken\u201d allowed Franken to showcase his routine that was part stand-up comedy, impersonations of former Senate colleagues like Bernie Sanders and Chuck Grassley, a walk down memory lane, and the inevitable political hot takes of current events. As you would expect, he tore into President Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to turn now to the essential task before us, which assuming he\u2019s in the White House a year from now, is defeating the sick, cruel, corrupt psychopath,\u201d Franken said. \u201cNow that\u2019s just my opinion.\u201d \u201cThe thing about Donald Trump is in addition to being a compulsive liar, a serial conman, a white supremacist and just kind of a jerk, this guy \u2026 does not know what he is doing,\u201d he added.\n\nThere is nothing new or fresh in any of that, is there? He checked all the usual boxes in criticism of the president \u2013 mentally unstable, liar, conman, white supremacist \u2013 it\u2019s all there. I don\u2019t know about you but I prefer comedians who are able to deliver some original material, not warmed-over talking points from every Democrat in office.\n\nFranken didn\u2019t exactly receive a lot of attention from attendees, if this photo on Twitter is any indication. There are a whole lot of empty seats in the Music City Center auditorium.\n\nPoliticon crowd for Al Franken pic.twitter.com/XdSty6DfK0 \u2014 Ben Terris (@bterris) October 27, 2019\n\nOne person stood up and yelled at Franken before leaving the room.\n\nThere was one tense moment during the speech. After Franken explained \u201cthat\u2019s why I\u2019m a Democrat,\u201d one attendee yelled out \u201cYou\u2019re also a liar, a fraud and a sexual predator.\u201dFranken seemed unfazed. \u201cAh don\u2019t go,\u201d he joked as the man left the room. He paused and added, \u201cI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s a serious accusation and i take it seriously,\u201d before returning to his scripted remarks.\n\nFranken\u2019s appearance was featured prominently in advertising of the event.\n\n. @AlFranken makes his return to the national scene at #Politicon2019, and there\u2019s no holding back this time. Join us at @NashvilleMCC Oct 26 & 27 to hear Franken as he cuts through conventional wisdom to tell it how it really is.

The event, now in its fifth year, drew thousands of people \u2015 Republicans, Democrats and everyone in between \u2015 from across the country to its new location in Nashville. Politicon, previously held in Los Angeles, has become a forum for media pundits, current and former lawmakers and celebrities to discuss and debate politics in front of crowds of political junkies. When asked why Franken was tapped as a keynote for the fifth annual event, co-organizer Simon Sidi said he\u2019s wanted to book Franken as a panelist for years. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to get Al here anyway just because you know he\u2019s so great and people love him so much,\u201d Sidi told HuffPost. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to have him, very happy.\u201d\n\nFrom the empty chairs to the heckler interrupting his speech by pointing out that he is much of what he accuses President Trump of being, it looks like Al Franken has a lot of work to do. His road to a comeback may be longer than he thinks.", "description": "Too soon?", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Taylor Millard"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1fda72d1-6f06-4e6c-9052-df19f80a076b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
