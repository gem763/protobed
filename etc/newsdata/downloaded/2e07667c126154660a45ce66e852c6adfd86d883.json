We just wanted to go on holiday,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThings first kicked off when the group at the back got into a fight. Punches were thrown, and the stewardess broke them up.\n\n\u201cBut then they kicked off again, and passengers actually intervened to calm them down.\n\n\u201cOne woman got in the way, but a guy spat in her eye.
