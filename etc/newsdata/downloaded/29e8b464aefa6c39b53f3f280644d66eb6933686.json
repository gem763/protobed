The song debuted when she was 6 years old, and she was later awarded a Guinness World Record for Youngest R&B Chart Entrant.\n\n\"When she gets older, she can grow up and say, 'my dad put me on the song. My dad sung songs about me\u2026 my dad put my name everywhere,' \" Eminem said in an interview in the early 2000s.\n\nHe also rapped about her in \"Hailie's Song\" in 2002: \"My baby girl keeps getting older / I watch her grow up with pride \u2026 My insecurities could eat me alive/ But then I see my baby / Suddenly I'm not crazy / It all makes sense when I look into her eyes.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Eminem's daughter Hailie Jade is Ariana Grande in Halloween costume", "description": "Hailie Jade Mathers, Eminem's 23-year-old daughter, is channeling a musician for Halloween this year.
