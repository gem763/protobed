It was a darker offering than their previous poppier album Present: You, and this was reflected in the tone of this tour. The members were tortured by an eclipse in the opening film that laid out their concept \u2013 they are lost and only their fans Ahgase (short for IGOT7) can help them find the light.\n\nDespite the palpable enthusiasm from fans, the members seemed to have the whole light-finding thing on lock, oozing attitude through a ferocious first half kicking off with Eclipse. I\u2019m Out and Skyway were random choices from their back catalogue, but they provided two of the most impressive dance breaks of the night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere other groups\u2019 unit stages can feel like filler or incomplete, GOT7 shined separately as performers. You could have happily watched two hours of Youngjae flirting with men in masks, or group leader JB grinning like a demon around a gag in his mouth. The rapline, decked out in flashy jackets, dealt a one-two punch with God Has Returned and the bass-heavy, swaggering Ma\u00f1ana.\n\nThe short and sweet unit stages nipped along at nice pace, so the lull wasn\u2019t there. But the timing went against them too. GOT7 has been together for five years and the chemistry came off them in waves. Bam Bam teased Mark, the oldest member, about his age between songs. At another point, Jackson tried to read lyrics off a teleprompter and Youngjae dashed over and covered his eyes. These guys are warm, funny and sincere \u2013 if only the bullet train of a setlist gave them a bit more time to chat.\n\nOther fandoms will argue this, as they are entitled to, but GOT7 is easily one of if not the strongest K-pop group vocally. This was especially evident in 1\u00b0, Paradise, Look and Thank You, the rapline\u2019s low tones harmonising tenderly with the singers (props to Youngjae again).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd even though they were clearly flagging, (the non stop dancing and live singing left them literally flat on the floor and unable to talk at some points) they mustered up enough energy, enough light if you like, to really bring it home for the encore. Face-melting banger Hard Carry was a welcome addition, with the festive Miracle giving Ahgase a moment to breathe before bringing out the big guns. Shopping Mall served early 00s R\u2019n\u2019B realness and deep cuts Go Higher and Girls Girls Girls (their debut single) had people dancing in the aisles.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nTheir ending \u2018ments\u2019, or speeches, were littered with basic crowd-pleasing platitudes like \u2018I love this city\u2019 and \u2018thank you for coming\u2019, however that\u2019s to be expected given the language barrier for some members. But Jinyoung mentioning the group\u2019s comeback next month got massive cheers.\n\nMark confessed the members were anxious about how many people would turn up on the night. An artist admitting they were worried they wouldn\u2019t sell tickets is practically unheard of, and displayed the closeness between GOT7 and their fans after two blistering hours of looking as untouchable as gods. Or idols. But he, JB, Jinyoung, Jackson, Bam Bam, Youngjae and Yugyeom needn\u2019t have feared. If anything, we should be the ones worried about how long we\u2019ll have to wait until they come back here\u2026\n\nGot a showbiz story?
