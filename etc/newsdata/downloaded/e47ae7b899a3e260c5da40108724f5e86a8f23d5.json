Youthful activists cite all-too depressing science and develop angst. They grieve for a future they worry they\u2019ll never have.\n\nMany young climate activists say they feel hopeless and overwhelmed. Psychologists say it\u2019s good they\u2019re talking about it. It\u2019s sometimes called \u201cclimate change anxiety,\u201d and you don\u2019t have to be an activist - or young - to feel it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to grow up on a planet full of ifs,\u201d said This is Zero Hour co-founder Jamie Margolin, a 17-year-old from Seattle, who is finding hard to buckle down and apply to colleges. \u201cThere\u2019s always been a sense that everything beautiful in this world is temporary for my generation.\u201d\n\nBeing young is tough and emotional to begin with. Add into that mixture a world where each scientific report - such as one that came out Wednesday - seems gloomier than the one before, and you have a recipe for anxiety.\n\n\u201cComing to terms with the fact that we have lived on a dying planet is terrifying,\u201d said 18-year-old activist Kaylah Brathwaite, a Charlotte, North Carolina college student. \u201cI\u2019ll give speeches and I\u2019ll cry\u2026. I\u2019m just going to have to be scared for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nMax Prestigiacomo of Madison, Wisconsin and the Youth Climate Action Team, said as he left Saturday\u2019s U.N. Youth Climate Summit in New York that \u201cclimate anxiety is justified\u201d because politicians are doing nothing.\n\n\u201cA lot of us say we can\u2019t think more than 16 months ahead because we don\u2019t know the environment we will have to grow up with,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen they meet with world leaders or testify before Congress, as Margolin did earlier this month, the students emphasize the personal toll that climate change is taking on them.\n\n\u201cYoung people from different parts of the world are living in constant fear and climate anxiety, fearing their future,\u201d Komal Kumar, a youth climate activist from Fiji, told United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at Saturday\u2019s youth climate summit.\n\nNowhere it was more obvious than on Monday. Usually, the most visible young climate activist, 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, gives mostly emotionless talks. At a U.S. congressional hearing she said, simply: \u201cI don\u2019t want you to listen to me. I want you to listen to the scientists.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, she shed the stick-to-the-science message and frequently choked up when she scolded world leaders at the United Nations, repeating the phrase \u201chow dare you\u201d over and over in a highly praised address.\n\n\u201cYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\u201d she said, later adding \u201cWe will never forgive you.\u201d\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to be famous or even an activist to feel it.\n\nAdam Stater, a 15-year-old from Sewickley, Pennsylvania, wants to get more active about global warming but hasn\u2019t yet. What he reads, he said, scares him. He wonders \u201cif I will be able to live my life to the fullest. Will I get to be old?\u201d\n\nSarah Warren, a Chicago psychologist, said she sees the anxiety as relatively widespread.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of feeling that we\u2019re cooked, and there\u2019s an inevitability to that and that there\u2019s not much they can do,\u201d said Warren, who sees such emotions - even in her own children - starting in middle school and running through college.\n\n\u201cA sense of helplessness underlies the anxiety,\u201d Warren said.\n\nMany young people talk about the world having only 11 years left or some variation of that message. Climate scientists, including Victor Gensini of Northern Illinois University, say that is a common misinterpretation of a U.N. report last year that looked at the difference between two different temperature goals in fighting climate change.\n\nPeople need to educate themselves on how the problem is severe but not fatal, he said.\n\n\u201cClimate change is a wicked problem that is going to require all of us to address, and that itself seems like an impossible mountain to climb,\u201d Gensini said in an email. \u201cYet there are decisions all of us can make right now to mitigate the impacts.\u201d\n\nPundits, especially non-scientists who reject mainstream climate science, often dismiss young activists\u2019 feelings and what they say, even using the word \u2018snowflake\u2019 as an insult.\n\nExperts say that\u2019s dead wrong.\n\n\u201cActually, we should all be feeling anxious about the situation. It\u2019s a healthy response,\u201d said London-based psychoanalyst Sally Weintrobe , editor of the book \u201cEngaging with Climate Change,\u201d who works on the psychology of global warming. \u201cIf you are not anxious about this, then you are not in touch with reality.\u201d\n\nWeintrobe said emotions about climate change are similar to the mourning cycle, with people going through denial, rage and acceptance. She said she has felt ecological anxiety herself.\n\nFor young people, climate anxiety \u201cis a very tough thing for them to take. How grownups react is critical to them,\u201d Weintrobe said.\n\nMany grownups are in their corner - and recognize the anxiety. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, speaking at the U.N. on Wednesday, talked of children who write him letters about their concerns for their future - including about climate change.\n\n\u201cOur children have a right not just to their future but to their optimism,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cAbove all, we must let our children be children, let our kids be kids, let our teenagers be teenagers, while we do the work positively together to deliver the practical solutions for them and their future.\u201d\n\nClimate scientists say they see the anxiety in students and even, at times, in themselves. They say they often cling to optimism that the world will eventually tackle the problems they highlight.\n\nUniversity of Michigan climate scientist Richard Rood, who said he has made grown academics cry in despair during some of his presentations, said his students \u201cmostly get really depressed by the first part of the course, and then they pull it together at the end when they see how they can handle it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy emotion more and more is moving into acceptance of loss,\u201d Rood said. \u201cThere is a loss coming, and you have to prepare yourself about it.\u201d\n\nDoing something about the problem can help ease the anxiety, the psychologists say. Some young people have found their way to that conclusion as well.\n\nFive to 10 years ago, Loay Radiwan of Egypt said he felt depressed and thought: \u201cThere\u2019s no way you\u2019re getting out of this. It\u2019s getting worse and worse.\u201d\n\nSo Radiwan, who was at the United Nations youth summit for a hackathon session, became active beyond protest. The 20-year-old developed a robotic beetle that helps Egyptian farmers monitor water in the soil to adapt to the problems of climate change.\n\nRadiwan\u2019s anxiety is mostly gone, he said: \u201cActually, I\u2019m quite excited.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Science Writer Seth Borenstein has covered climate issues for nearly 25 years.
