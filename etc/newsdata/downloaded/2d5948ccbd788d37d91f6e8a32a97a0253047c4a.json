It just shows you the agency of images to destabilise our perceptions.'\n\nMr Dworzak told the paper he found the photos 'incredibly touching,' despite the ruthless hypocrisy they represent.\n\n'I'm almost envious of the photographer that they could take these portraits of these guys,' he said. 'The Taliban then were the absolute personification of evil and you have them holding hands with plastic flowers. It is very confusing but I like that.\n\nThe Barbican say of their Masculinity exhibition: 'In the wake of #MeToo the image of masculinity has come into sharper focus, with ideas of toxic and fragile masculinity permeating today's society.\n\n'This exhibition charts the often complex and sometimes contradictory representations of masculinities, and how they have developed and evolved over time.'\n\nBarbican curator Alona Pardo said: 'These are not constructed photographs, these men have chosen to have the photographs made and present themselves to camera like that. It just shows you the agency of images to destabilise our perceptions.'\n\nAn anti-Taliban soldiers walks through rubble created by US bombing, near the residence of former Taliban leader Mullah Umar near Kandahar, Afghanistan, Monday April 15, 2002 - under Umar's regime the taking of photos was banned\n\nThe fighters pose before bright primary colours in the surprising images uncovered in Kandahar at the height of the war\n\nIt will feature work from 50 photographers and filmmakers, including Laurie Anderson, Sunil Gupta, Rotimi Fani-Kayode, Isaac Julien and Catherine Opie.\n\nThe exhibition will run from February 20 to May 17 at the Barbican Centre, Silk Street, EC2.\n\nThomas Dworzak's Taliban book is available on Amazon.", "description": "The bizarre Warholesque images were uncovered in Kandahar, Afghanistan, at the height of the war in 2002 by German photographer\u00a0Thomas Dworzak.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/18/20095350-0-image-a-38_1571852490114.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
