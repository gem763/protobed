This time she\u2019s not the target.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "\n\nFormer prime minister Theresa May, smiling, as she sits next to father of the house, Conservative MP Kenneth Clark in the House of Commons in London on Sept. 3, 2019. (PRU/AFP)\n\nAs prime minister, Theresa May was direct in her criticism of lawmakers in Britain\u2019s Parliament, whom she accused as recently as March of \u201cinfighting,\u201d \u201cpolitical games and the arcane procedural rows.\u201d\n\nNow, more than a month after she resigned amid a lack of confidence in her ability to oversee an orderly British exit from the European Union, she sits in Parliament among the very lawmakers she so pointedly criticized.\n\nWith her successor and fellow Conservative Party member Boris Johnson losing his parliamentary majority on Tuesday amid larger opposition from within his own party, speculation has swirled around how May will handle her role as a rank-and-file lawmaker.\n\nWill May join the rebellion against Johnson as some have suggested after she chose to watch cricket instead of attending Johnson\u2019s first speech as prime minister? Or will she back him in his effort to suspend Parliament during a critical period ahead of the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline?\n\nIn a first indication, May voted with Johnson on a key procedural vote on Tuesday \u2014 a vote Johnson still lost, as other Conservative MPs joined forces with the opposition to pave the way for a legislative Brexit battle on Wednesday.\n\nThose who know her say May is unlikely to make moves that will draw attention in the future, too, breaking a tradition of former British leaders who loomed large over politics after leaving office.\n\nChris Wilkins, a former director of strategy for May when she occupied 10 Downing Street, said May will most likely support Johnson.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental thing that I think people need to understand about Theresa May is that she has been part of the fabric of the Conservative Party since her teenage years,\u201d Wilkins said in an interview. \u201cDoing anything now that is seeking to sort of destabilize or criticize the party is just very, very unlikely from her.\u201d\n\nRosa Prince, who wrote a biography of May, agreed that the former prime minister is unlikely to rebel easily. There is the possibility May \u201cvery reluctantly feels pushed at the last moment\u201d to prevent the no-deal Brexit Johnson is open to \u2014 and puts \u201cher country over her party,\u201d Prince said.\n\nWhatever May does, most of it will probably go unnoticed on a national stage. Even though May\u2019s return to Parliament as a backbencher is nothing unusual in British history \u2014 former prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and David Cameron, among others, did the same \u2014 some hope she will do so with the intent of serving the constituency that put her there.\n\nAfter long struggling to find a footing in politics, she won in the district of Maidenhead \u2014 and she has been \u201crepaying the favor ever since,\u201d Prince said.\n\nAs home secretary and later on as prime minister, May continued to meet with members of her constituency over the weekend, shopped in the local supermarket and attended church on Sundays.\n\nMay\u2019s deep connection to her home district could foreshadow the way she seeks to make use of her remaining time in Parliament.\n\nShe is likely to \u201cstay clear of a lot of the drama that\u2019s going on, particularly in the next few weeks and months, but she\u2019ll prove quite active for her constituency,\u201d Prince said. May could also become a stronger advocate for issues she has prioritized, including combating modern slavery or empowering women in politics.\n\nA number of other former prime ministers chose strikingly different paths.\n\nCameron stood down as a lawmaker shortly after he announced his resignation as prime minister. While his critics slammed Cameron, suggesting he had always been more interested in his own career than in representing his voters, Cameron said he was afraid he would become a \u201cdistraction.\u201d\n\nStaying in Parliament \u201cwas just going to be difficult\u201d for him, said Cameron\u2019s former deputy chief of staff, Kate Fall, as everyone would know how he is voting.\n\nHe and other former prime ministers \u2014 including former Labour Party leader Tony Blair \u2014 went on to obtain lucrative corporate contracts. Cameron has also been writing his memoir.\n\n\u201cI doubt there\u2019s going to be a huge market for [May\u2019s] memoirs,\u201d said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London. \u201cShe\u2019s probably . . . not likely to sort of cash in on her time as prime minister.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nWant to understand Boris Johnson, Britain\u2019s probable next prime minister?
