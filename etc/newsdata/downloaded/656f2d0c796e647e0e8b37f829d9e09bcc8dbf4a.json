(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nThe GOP\u2019s fiscal hawks have finally flown the coop.\n\nThis week, the Congressional Budget Office released its latest estimate for the federal budget deficit for the fiscal year that just ended. Lo and behold, the deficit likely reached nearly $1 trillion \u2014 $984 billion, to be precise. Final numbers are due from the Treasury Department any day now.\n\nTo put this in context: This was the largest annual deficit in both raw dollar terms and as a share of the economy since 2012, when we were still recovering from the aftermath of the financial crisis and ensuing Great Recession. It was also a huge jump from where it was when President Trump first took office; the deficit is up by 26 percent since fiscal 2018 and a whopping 48 percent since 2017.\n\nThis is, needless to say, not what either Trump or others in his party told us to expect under Republican leadership. For years, the GOP cast itself as the party of fiscal responsibility, fighting tooth and nail against virtually any Obama-era expense even when the struggling economy desperately needed more fiscal stimulus.\n\nWhen he ran for president in 2016, Trump promised to not only shrink deficits but to actually eliminate the entire federal debt \u2014 that is, to pay down all the accumulated deficits we\u2019ve had over the years, which now add up to about $23 trillion.\n\nThe King of Debt\u2019s promise to wipe out government debt was always nonsense. But reducing deficits? That seemed at least theoretically possible.\n\nWe\u2019re more than a decade into an economic expansion, after all. For most of the postwar period, when unemployment was low, budget deficits fell or even flipped into surpluses.\n\n\n\nCongressional Budget Office data. Years shown are fiscal years. Chart is adapted from one originally created by Goldman Sachs Economic Research. (Catherine Rampell/The Washington Post)\n\nThat\u2019s because a strong economy usually means much stronger tax revenue: People and companies earn more money and so remit more taxes. A strong economy also typically means less need for safety-net services such as food stamps or unemployment benefits, and therefore less overall government spending.\n\nIn the past few years, though, the health of the economy and the health of the budget have decoupled. In fact, fiscal 2019 was the fourth consecutive year in which the deficit increased as a percentage of the economy, despite falling unemployment.\n\nSo what went wrong?\n\nTo be fair, the country is aging. That means more Americans enrolling in Social Security and Medicare, which of course swells spending.\n\nBut even aside from this demographic change, our political leaders, corralled by Trump, have made things appreciably worse through their policy choices.\n\nA political leader who\u2019s serious about curbing budget deficits would propose actual fixes \u2014 including unpopular or painful ones, such as spending cuts or tax hikes. Instead, Trump decided to go on a tax-cut-and-spending-hike spree. He wished away the predictable deficit consequences with promises of turbocharged growth. While independent forecasters projected long-term economic growth around 2 percent, Trump instead pledged rates around 5 percent.\n\nAs I\u2019ve explained before, a good rule of thumb is that the more growth a politician promises, the worse his economic plan likely is; it suggests he needed to make extra-rosy assumptions to get his math to work out. And that has clearly been the case with Trump.\n\nEven Trump\u2019s own economic advisers, such as Stephen Moore, now admit 5 percent economic growth was never remotely feasible. Trumpkins eventually scaled back their growth promises to a \u201cmere\u201d 4 percent, but those haven\u2019t materialized, either.\n\nWe had a brief sugar high in growth last year, and now we\u2019re reverting to annual rates in the mid-2-percent range. Which, to be clear, is still respectable. Because Republicans slashed tax rates, though, Treasury coffers haven\u2019t benefited much from the continued expansion.\n\nCorporate tax receipts, for instance, are projected to be up from last year (likely because the tax cuts front-loaded some changes, such as full expensing). But corporate tax revenue is still down a net 23 percent from fiscal 2017, the final year before the GOP tax overhaul.\n\nEven rising tariff revenue \u2014 which, despite Trump\u2019s claims to the contrary, are taxes paid by Americans \u2014 won\u2019t make up the difference. In other words: No, tax cuts aren\u2019t paying for themselves. The CBO estimated that the GOP tax cut would actually leave deficits over the next decade nearly $2 trillion larger than they would have otherwise been had the tax system stayed the same.\n\nMeanwhile, federal spending has grown. A lot. And not just on the growing legions of elderly Americans; defense and other areas of discretionary spending have also shot up under Trump\u2019s presidency. So have interest payments on the debt, even as interest rates have fallen.\n\nThere\u2019s nary a peep about any of these trends from politicians of either party. And don\u2019t expect one anytime soon \u2014 at least not until there\u2019s a Democrat back in the White House, when we can expect all those Republican fiscal hawks to abruptly fly back home.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s policies haven\u2019t helped his campaign promise.", "authors": ["Catherine Rampell", "Columnist Covering Economics", "Public Policy", "Politics", "Catherine Rampell Is An Opinion Columnist At The Washington Post.
