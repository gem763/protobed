The incident subsequently caused a storm with the Australia head coach, Michael Cheika, claiming he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the confusion surrounding World Rugby\u2019s crackdown on high tackles and Kerevi suggesting that rugby had gone \u201csoft\u201d.\n\nRugby World Cup refereeing confusion is hindering drive to grow game | Andy Bull Read more\n\nFrom the initial break in play to Patchell slotting the penalty there was a delay of more than five minutes, while during the first half of England\u2019s opening match against Tonga there were four incidents referred to the TMO before half-time, leading to a first half of nearly an hour and denying Mitchell\u2019s side the chance to find much rhythm. Indeed, they did not score a bonus-point try until the 77th minute.\n\nThis week, however, the World Rugby vice-president Agust\u00edn Pichot revealed the governing body is exploring the possibility of employing Hawk-Eye technology in an effort to police the offside line with a number of blatant incidents missed by officials in Japan. Four years ago the opening rounds of the World Cup were plagued by the large number of TMO referrals, however, which led to increased delays and frustration among supporters.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I would say is that as fans of the game, if there\u2019s going to be large debates about decisions \u2013 like that case the other day \u2013 let\u2019s make sure those large amounts of time where there\u2019s a debate around something are focused on priorities as opposed to just taking a long time,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more stoppages in the game and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to stop. That\u2019s the only thing, there\u2019s a huge amount of stoppages.\u201d\n\nMitchell also insisted that England were not serial offenders when it comes to straying offside, revealing he comes down hard on those who transgress and even keeps a record of those who do. \u201cIt\u2019s a really big part of our behaviour in terms of staying onside, its something we work a lot on and work very hard on should an individual transgress in that area,\u201d he added. \u201cWe even measure it, that\u2019s how critical we are in terms of wanting to make sure that we get that right. We\u2019re a big believer in the half-yard that we take gives us the chance to create more speed anyway as a defensive line.\u201d\n\nThe England fly-half George Ford said: \u201cOur aim is to be whiter than white because the thing we\u2019ve seen is that one penalty can change the momentum of the game massively. A lot of them are coming from offside, so a lot of them are probably coming from the collision area as well. It\u2019s something we want to be ultra disciplined in.\u201d", "description": "The England defence coach has claimed officials are taking too long deliberating over decisions and fears more technology to help them could make matters worse", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f517054556d0aaa5adb094528a223902ad9a4cbb/102_101_2094_1256/master/2094.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=01150a3b1b5226e8115e3ee33941a735"}
