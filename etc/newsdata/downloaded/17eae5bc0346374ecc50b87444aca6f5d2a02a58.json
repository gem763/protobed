Goalie Mikko Koskinen made 25 saves in his season debut.\n\nAnthony Beauvillier and Matt Martin scored for the Islanders, who lost two of three on a season-opening three-game homestand. Starting goalie Semyon Varlamov was chased after giving up four goals on 19 shots. Thomas Greiss made seven saves in relief.\n\nNeal became the third Oilers player this century to collect four goals in a game and the first since teammate Connor McDavid did it against the Tampa Bay Lightning on Feb. 5, 2018.\n\nThe four-goal game was the first against the Islanders since Patrik Elias scored four times for the New Jersey Devils on March 30, 2003.\n\nBeauvillier gave the Islanders a short-lived lead by scoring a breakaway short-handed goal with 5:46 left in the first.\n\nNeal began and finished the sequence that ended with his first goal. After intercepting a Devon Toews pass along the boards behind the Islanders' net, Neal dished to Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, who briefly had the puck swiped from him by Beauvillier. But Neal swooped in, grabbed the puck back and fired a shot past Varlamov from the left faceoff circle.\n\nNeal completed his natural hat trick with two power play goals. He gave the Oilers the lead for good just 96 seconds later, when he was stationed to the left of the net and tucked home a pass from McDavid.\n\nNeal was on the other side of the net 6:31 into the second, when he took a pass from Leon Draisaitl and flicked it past Varlamov.\n\nKassian chased Varlamov just 2:15 later.\n\nNeal scored his fourth goal from the front of the left faceoff circle 6:51 into the third. Martin pulled the Islanders within 5-2 with 6:28 left.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "James Neal collected a natural hat trick in a span of fewer than nine minutes  bridging the first and second periods and finished with a career-high four ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
