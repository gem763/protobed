One bonus point is awarded for scoring four tries, irrespective of the result.

The number one ranked side will be confident of securing the top position as long as they can defeat Scotland in their opening game. Scotland have a great opportunity to make it into the quarter-finals as the other Tier 1 side. However, they will face stiff competition from the hosts Japan who will equally see this pool as a chance to make it into the knockout stages. Japan vs Scotland is the last fixture in the group and could well be the decider.\n\nStory continues\n\nSamoa showed some promise in their last warm-up match against Australia and will be targeting both the Japan and Scotland fixtures for an upset. Russia look somewhat hopeless - they lost comfortably to Championship side Jersey Reds in one of their warm-up fixtures.\n\nIreland are likely to come first, with Scotland joining them in the quarter-finals. But Japan should not be discounted, especially at home. This pool could come down to bonus points.\n\nPool A fixtures:\n\nJapan 30 Russia 10... Tokyo Stadium... Friday, September 20... 11.45am BST...

The rest of the pool matches will be relatively straightforward for them.\n\nItaly are the next best side in this pool but have failed to kick on under the leadership of Conor O'Shea. It seems unlikely they will pose much of a challenge to either the All Blacks or the Springboks. Canada and Namibia will battle it out to avoid coming last in the pool - Canada will be favourites as number 22 and 23 in the world rankings clash.\n\nThe energy of New Zealand and South Africa will be focused on beating one another - and thereby avoiding Ireland in the quarter-finals, assuming Ireland win their pool.\n\nThe winner of New Zealand vs South Africa is likely to get a favourable draw in the knockout stages Credit: Getty Images\n\nPool B fixtures:\n\nNew Zealand 23 South Africa 13...

England are expected to progress while second place is very tough to call. The French are capable of beating both Argentina and England. Argentina's form dropped off towards the end of the Rugby Championship but the Pumas have a very talented side that will expect to reach the knockout stages.\n\nTonga are not the force they once were. They were hammered by New Zealand 92-7 in their last warm-up match which will have dented their hopes of causing an upset. Conversely the USA are a team on the rise. They have a number of talented individuals scattered throughout their squad. A surprise win against Tonga would constitute a successful tournament for the USA.\n\nThis pool could end with three teams all winning three out of their four games which would make bonus points vital. England are favourites to come first with France just edging ahead of Argentina.\n\nEngland face France in their last group match Credit: Getty Images\n\nPool C fixtures:\n\nFrance 23 Argentina 21...

(ITV)\n\nPool D assessment:\n\nWales are favourites to top the pool but face tough opposition in a resurgent Australia. Australia showed a lot of promise in the Rugby Championship including a victory over the All Blacks but are yet to prove they can perform consistently against top-level opposition. This pool presents a variety of challenges with the contrasting styles of free-flowing Fiji and forward dominated Georgia. Fiji pose the biggest threat to Wales and Australia. The talent they possess is well known about but crucially they have had a long time together to prepare.\n\nGeorgia will be a tricky opposition to breakdown but ultimately are lacking enough quality in the backline to cause a major upset. It is going to be a long tournament for Uruguay who have the unfortunate task of playing four teams on a different level to them.\n\nWales and Australia are likely to progress but Fiji have the ability to cause a scare at the very least.\n\nPool D fixtures:\n\nAustralia 39 Fiji 21...
