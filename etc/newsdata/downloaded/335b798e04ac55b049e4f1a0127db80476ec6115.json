Their insight could be helpful to Democrats hoping to learn more about the dual strategies that the U.S. was taking on Ukraine \u2014 the official one and the operation that multiple officials have told lawmakers hinged on the country investigating political rivals of the president.\n\nIt's unclear if either of the officials plans to show up for their scheduled appearances. The Trump administration has attempted to block various witnesses Democrats have called before them, including one witness earlier this week who filed a lawsuit in hopes that the courts could help guide witnesses as the legislative and executive branch face off.\n\nCNN reported that both Croft and Anderson worked under then-Special Envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker, who has emerged as a key witness in the impeachment investigation.\n\nCroft's background includes work on Ukraine for both the State Department and the National Security Council, the outlet reported. Similarly, Anderson's resume includes working at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.\n\nMore: House resolution outlines public phase of impeachment inquiry, gives GOP subpoena powers\n\nThe two are scheduled to follow Tuesday's testimony of Lt.
