About four of the last seven tries (Wales scored) against France have been situations where we kept working hard to chase, and one of their players has made an error and we have capitalised.\"\n\nBut Gatland added: \"Defensively, (Wales defence coach) Shaun (Edwards) has been a little bit more on edge this week.\n\n\"He was not too happy with conceding a try against Uruguay, and he let the players know clearly in the changing room afterwards.\"\n\nTeams:\n\nWales\n\n15 Liam Williams, 14 George North, 13 Jonathan Davies, 12 Hadleigh Parkes, 11 Josh Adams, 10 Dan Biggar, 9 Gareth Davies, 8 Josh Navidi, 7 Justin Tipuric, 6 Aaron Wainwright, 5 Alun Wyn Jones (captain), 4 Jake Ball, 3 Tomas Francis, 2 Ken Owens, 1 Wyn Jones\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Elliot Dee, 17 Rhys Carre, 18 Dillon Lewis, 19 Adam Beard, 20 Ross Moriarty, 21 Tomos Williams, 22 Rhys Patchell, 23 Owen Watkin\n\nFrance\n\n15 Maxime Medard, 14 Damian Penaud, 13 Virimi Vakatawa, 12 Gael Fickou, 11 Yoann Huget, 10 Romain Ntamack, 9 Antoine Dupont, 8 Gregory Alldritt, 7 Charles Ollivon, 6 Wenceslas Lauret, 5 Sebastien Vahaamahina, 4 Bernard Le Roux, 3 Rabah Slimani, 2 Guilhem Guirado (captain), 1 Jefferson Poirot\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Cyril Baille, 17 Camille Chat, 18 Emerick Setiano, 19 Paul Gabrillagues, 20 Louis Picamoles, 21 Baptiste Serin, 22 Camille Lopez, 23 Vincent Rattez", "description": "Warren Gatland believes Wales' recent record shows they can cope with the burden of expectation as they head into the World Cup quarter-finals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7921/83ce6f922c564d73ae0b1b3a92e811be.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
