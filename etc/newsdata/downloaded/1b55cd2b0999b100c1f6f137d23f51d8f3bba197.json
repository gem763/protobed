Others, meanwhile, defended the restaurant for trying to maintain a particular atmosphere.\n\nIts website says The Choptank is \u201copening soon.\u201d An image uploaded on Twitter of the sign said to be on the restaurant's gate shows an apparent dress code.\n\nCHILI'S EMPLOYEE FINDS CREMATED HUMAN REMAINS OUTSIDE RESTAURANT: 'I CAME TO WORK TODAY AND FOUND A BOX OF ASHES'\n\nThe sign in the photo says items like \u201cexcessively baggy clothing, athletic attire, jerseys, brimless headgear and backwards or sideways hats\u201d are prohibited. The photo was captioned, \u201cDress CODED sign at the new Choptank restaurant in Fells,\u201d implying that the dress code had an ulterior motive.\n\nAnother user was more direct with their criticism, posting, \u201cY'all could have saved yourselves some time and just posted a \u2018No Black People\u2019 sign.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOthers echoed the sentiment, with one user posting, \"this is racist as hell and I will never enter your restaurant and will actively warn others away from it, have a great day.\"\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, a spokesperson for Atlas Restaurant Group, who own The Choptank, said, \u201cOur policy is no different than countless other bars in Fells Point, Federal Hill and many other bar/restaurants around Maryland including Seacrets and Tiki Lee\u2019s both posted on their websites. There are also national properties such as Wynn Las Vegas (XS) that have similar dress codes in their entertainment venus. The most prominent African-American nightclub in Baltimore, Select Lounge has a stricter dress code as well. Baltimore City Public Schools has a similar dress code and language for their students.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nThey also provided Fox News with an official dress code, which was slightly different than the one featured in the photo on Twitter. While it was mostly similar, it didn\u2019t prohibit the wearing of baggy clothes, sideways hats or sunglasses after dark.", "description": "A Baltimore restaurant is coming under fire before it\u2019s even opened.", "authors": ["Michael Hollan"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/abc809b2-Baltimore.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
