The Ukraine-Gate allegations might have some Republicans distancing themselves from Donald Trump, but The Hill reports that the shift to an impeachment inquiry has begun putting pressure on Democratic unity as well. A split has started to emerge between moderates who want to stay focused on Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, and progressives who want to throw everything but the kitchen sink at the president:\n\nSenate Democrats representing red states are worried the House impeachment process may spin out of control and destroy any chance their party might have of winning back the majority next year. These Democrats hope the House keeps its impeachment focus on the Ukraine controversy, and that Democrats act relatively quickly. If they do not, the red-state Democrats warn Trump could turn the tables on them. \u201cIt\u2019s really incumbent on the House to really be laser-focused. The president is a master of pivoting and deflecting and I think it\u2019s really important to stay focused,\u201d said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), who narrowly won re-election in a Republican-leaning state in 2018.\n\nTester\u2019s not alone in his concerns. The Hill\u2019s Alexander Bolton spoke with Joe Manchin, another deep-red state that will no doubt stick with Trump unless Democrats produce a smoking gun, and Manchin\u2019s every bit as skeptical about trying to make it about everything. He\u2019s also skeptical that his colleagues are listening, and for good reason:\n\nOne Democratic senator who requested anonymity to discuss the dynamics within the Democratic caucus said Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) has told his colleagues that Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) wants to keep the scope of the impeachment inquiry as narrow as possible. The senator, who favors a broader scope, said that \u201cpeople are worried\u201d about potential political fallout within the Democratic caucus. \u201cThe stakes go up for both sides at this point,\u201d the source added.\n\nThey do indeed, in part because there\u2019s little confidence at this point that Ukraine-Gate will be sufficient for impeachment, even among House Democrats. First off, a couple of dozen or more have to face voters in districts that went for Trump in 2016 and might do so again. If it begins to look like an impeachment in search of any justification or rationalization, they won\u2019t be able to defend it. Plus, they have the added issue of Hunter Biden\u2019s influence-peddling, which as Allahpundit wrote earlier turns out to be a bigger issue than Democrats might have first thought.\n\nThat leaves Pelosi stuck between a rock and a hard place. She declared \u201calea iacta est\u201d when she crossed the impeachment Rubicon last week without seeing the Zelensky transcript or the underlying complaint. Neither lived up to their initial billing, although neither can be entirely discounted yet either. The complaint turned out to be much more about Rudy Giuliani\u2019s activities in Ukraine than Trump\u2019s phone call per se. Even if Giuliani\u2019s acts pan out to be illegal \u2014 which is unlikely \u2014 the illegality would be Giuliani\u2019s. It might leave Trump with a lot of political baggage, but that would leave Pelosi with no clear path to impeachment unless she adopts the kitchen-sink approach that would sink her moderates in the next election.\n\nHaving Tester and Manchin speak out publicly against that strategy shows another risk. Democrats need twenty Senate Republicans to flip to remove Trump, and that won\u2019t happen on the basis of what Democrats have on any track. It sounds as though they might lose Manchin and Tester, and almost certainly Alabama\u2019s Doug Jones, if they go broad-spectrum with an inch-deep argument. They might lose them anyway, but at any rate removal is not in the cards. And if that\u2019s the case, why would Pelosi\u2019s moderates put their necks on the line in Trump-friendly districts for a dead-end stunt?\n\nThat\u2019s the tension that will start to split the Democratic caucuses on Capitol Hill, especially if this is all they end up bringing to an impeachment vote. That\u2019s still a very large if, of course.", "description": "\u201cThe stakes go up for both sides at this point.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/manchin-tester.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
