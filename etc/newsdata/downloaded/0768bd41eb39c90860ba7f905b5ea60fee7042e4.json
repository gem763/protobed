She barely moves in when she realizes that Kendrick\u2019s story needs to be told, so she works with her producing partner to create a film telling the world about this femme fatale who has largely been forgotten.\n\nThe chapters alternate between Glover following the path of Kendrick\u2019s life when she arrived in Hollywood and the finished film taking the reader into the 1940s. Benson outlines a world of prejudice where women who wanted to become stars were expected to sleep with producers and movie studio executives.\n\nKendrick wanted to see her name in lights, and when she\u2019s offered a lucrative contract, she thinks she\u2019s made it. When she falls in love with jazz musician Hank Marley, she quickly learns that interracial relationships aren\u2019t met by others with fondness.\n\nThe shifting perspective that contrasts Glover\u2019s quest and the resistance she meets to find out what happened to Kendrick with Kendrick\u2019s desire to make films and love the man she wants is compelling and heartbreaking. Benson has crafted a noir film inside the pages of a book and the cast of characters in the present and past come vividly to life. He also makes the reader question what is morally just in the midst of a well-written crime drama.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"Blues in the Dark: a Thriller,\" Arcade Books, by Raymond Benson", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jeff Ayers"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/book_review_-_blues_in_the_dark_06261_c0-850-1800-1899_s1770x1032.jpg?6141dd7f584f8a4fcf9eabe1b5ad615c538a060b", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
