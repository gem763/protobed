Those who lived with a partner or children were only 15 percent less likely to die after a heart attack.\n\nSimilarly, stroke survivors were more likely to keep surviving, if they had a dog.\n\nAfter a stroke, people were 27 percent less at-risk of dying if they owned a dog, but only 12 percent less at-risk if their partner or children lived with them.\n\nIn a second study, University of Toronto researchers looked at data on over 3.8 million people, documented in 10 prior studies.\n\nTheir findings suggested even more robust benefits of dog ownership.\n\nMan's best friend was linked to a 24 percent lower risk of death by any cause, a 65 percent lower risk of dying after a hart attack and 31 percent less probability of dying of any cardiovascular cause.\n\nThat's not surprising when you consider that previous studies, too, have documented the lower cholesterol and blood pressure profiles of dog owners and the share amount of time they spend being physically active on the animal's behalf.\n\nDogs are supposed to get between 30 minutes and two hours of exercise a day.\n\nThat's significantly more than the 150 minutes a week that is recommended for humans, so it stands to reason that those with pets would have a more athletic physique.\n\nMuch of the befit of a dog is a more mental than physical.\n\nAbout 40 percent of older Americans report periods of feeling isolated and alone.\n\nAnd a dog is one way to combat that.\n\n'We know that social isolation is a strong risk factor for worse health outcomes and premature death,' said Dr Tove Fall, an Uppdsala University professor and study co-author.\n\n'Previous studies have indicated that dog owners experience less social isolation and have more interaction with other people.\n\n'Furthermore, keeping a dog is a good motivation for physical activity, which is an important factor in rehabilitation and mental healthj,'\n\nAs strong as its links to better health are, Dr Tove had a rather measured take on what to do with this information.\n\n'More research is needed to confirm a causal relationship and giving recommendations about prescribing dogs for prevention,' said the study authors.\n\n'Moreover, from an animal welfare perspective, dogs should only be acquired by people who feel they have the capacity and knowledge to give the pet a good life.'", "description": "On the heels of two studies finding dog owners have better survival of heart attacks and strokes, the American Heart Association has stopped just short of recommending prescription pups.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/23/19413702-0-image-a-36_1570486220378.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
