I carried out the policy of the United States government. That\u2019s what we should be focusing on. My son\u2019s statement speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nBiden added that he was \u201cproud of the judgment\u201d Hunter made to go public in a television interview, before quickly pivoting back on Trump himself. \u201cThis president on three occasions has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged to try and alter our elections,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about Trump\u2019s corruption.\u201d\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), when asked a question about a federal jobs guarantee, used several moments of his time to appear to defend Biden.\n\n\u201cI want to say, I am having deja vu all over again,\u201d Booker started, dodging the moderator\u2019s question.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, because I saw this play in 2016\u2019s election. We are literally using Donald Trump\u2019s lies. And the second issue we cover is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman. That was so offensive. The only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump, seeing we are distracting from his malfeasance and selling-out of his office.\u201d\n\nThe elder Biden\u2019s comments came hours after his son gave his first interview about the unfounded allegations regarding his work in China and Ukraine\u2014allegations that have quietly dogged his father\u2019s 2020 campaign.\n\nSpeaking to ABC\u2019s Good Morning America about President Trump\u2019s claims of misconduct, which have been bolstered by his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Hunter Biden didn\u2019t go as far to say he would have acted differently in serving on multiple boards of foreign companies. Instead, he stated explicitly that he \u201cdid nothing wrong at all,\u201d but conceded that he did not foresee the political toll his prior work would take on his father\u2019s current political fortunes.\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part. Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don't believe now, when I look back on it \u2014I know that there was\u2014did nothing wrong at all,\u201d Hunter Biden said in the Tuesday morning interview with ABC. \u201cHowever, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is...a swamp in\u2014in\u2014in many ways? Yeah.\u201d\n\nThe younger Biden\u2019s television appearance and the elder Biden\u2019s opening comments were not addressed by other candidates on the stage directly, though Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) appeared to try and piggyback on the subject before being cut off by the moderators.\n\nBefore the debate, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield reiterated that the younger Biden had decided independently to appear on TV the same day as the Democratic debate in Ohio.\n\n\u201cHim sitting down and answering every question is more than you can say for Donald Trump,\u201d she told CNN host Wolf Blitzer.\n\nThe Daily Beast reported on Monday that the timing of the interview was seen as perplexing by several rival campaigns, and even by a top Biden surrogate himself, who suggested the move was ill advised.\n\nBefore his father launched his presidential campaign in April, Hunter Biden stepped down from the board of a private gas firm in Ukraine. But his work there has been under increased scrutiny by Republicans and the subject of baseless attacks by the Trump White House.\n\nMore recently, Trump has turned his focus to the younger Biden\u2019s work in China, though there too Hunter Biden has worked to tie up loose ends. This week, he announced he would step down from the board of the Chinese private equity company on which he served. In addition, his lawyer George Mesires writing that under a hypothetical Biden administration, Hunter Biden would \u201creadily comply with any and all guidelines or standards a President Biden may issue to address purported conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts, including any restrictions related to overseas business interests.\u201d\n\nMesires went on to write that, \u201cin any event, Hunter will agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign owned companies.\u201d\n\nOver the past several weeks, the Biden campaign has denied that any wrongdoing took place, and insisted that unnecessary attention paid to it would only play into Trump\u2019s hands. They\u2019ve even gone so far as to ask that Giuliani not be booked on television networks, pushing the boundaries of traditionally acceptable conduct from a political campaign.\n\nIn his ABC interview, Hunter took a moment to turn the attention back to Giuliani, saying he regrets \u201cnot taking into account that there would be a Rudy Giuliani and a president of the U.S. that would be listening to this ridiculous conspiracy idea which has again been completely debunked by everyone.\u201d", "description": "The former VP called the attacks a distraction by \u201cthugs\u201d President Donald Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani.", "authors": ["Hanna Trudo"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571185514/GettyImages-1181316173__1_m191sn", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
