I feel for her.\"\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nEven Mariam's early years were filled with heartbreak.\n\nHer mum walked out on her, her father and her five brothers and sisters just three days after she gave birth to Mariam.\n\nHe father re-married and Mariam's step-mother poisoned her older siblings by mixing cut glass in with their food.\n\nThey all died.\n\nA visit to a relative meant Mariam escaped with her life.\n\nShe said: \"I was seven years old then, too young to even understand what death actually meant.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"I was told by relatives what had happened.\"\n\nThe scars of her ordeal meant Mariam was desperate for a family of her own to love, although she admits she only ever wanted six children.\n\nHer youngsters have to make the best of what she manages to provide as a single parent.\n\nMetal bunk beds with thin mattresses are where 12 of her brood sleep in one small room with walls caked with grime.\n\nOthers have to share mattresses on the floor while some of the children are forced to sleep in the dirt because there is simply no space.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nEveryone piles in to help with chores like cooking and clearning while the older children look after their younger siblings.\n\nEach day, Mariam uses 25kgs of maize floor to ensure her children have enough to eat.\n\nAlthough fish and meat are rare treats for the family.\n\nMariam has to be organised to make sure each day runs smoothly on there is a rota of cooking and washing duties on a wooden board in the family home.\n\nIt reads: \"On Saturday, we all work together.\"\n\nBut Mariam's main hope for her children is that they will be happy.\n\nShe said: \"I started taking on adult responsibilities at an early stage.\n\n\"I have not had joy, I think, since I was born.\"", "description": "Mariam Nabatanzi had her first set of twins when she was just 13 and has since had another five sets, three sets of quads and four sets of triplets", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "Alamy Stock Photo", "Reujters", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14594172.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-The-Ugandan-woman-Mariam-Nabatanzi-sits-in-front-of-the-house-with-twelve-of-her-children-in-Kasawo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
