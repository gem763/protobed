This means a total collapse of the global economy, and not just Saudi Arabia or the Middle East countries.\u201d\n\nThe crown prince\u2019s comments come less than two weeks after drone attacks on his kingdom\u2019s oil facilities, for which it implicates Iran, temporarily knocked 5 percent of the world\u2019s production offline, causing prices to soar by more than 14 percent.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo called the attack an \u201cact of war,\u201d and when asked by \u201c60 Minutes\u201d bin Salman agreed, adding that a \u201cpolitical and peaceful solution is much better than the military one.\u201d Still, he said that all options remain on the table.\n\n\u201cIf the world does not take a strong and firm action to deter Iran, we will see further escalations that will threaten world interests,\u201d bin Salman said. \u201cOil supplies will be disrupted and oil prices will jump to unimaginably high numbers that we haven't seen in our lifetimes.\u201d Already, the attack pushed U.S. gas prices higher over the past two weeks.\n\nIn a recent note to clients, economists at the London-based research firm Capital Economics agreed.\n\n\u201cWar with the US would cause a collapse in Iran\u2019s economy that would directly knock around 0.3%-pts off global GDP \u2013 equal to the damage from the US-China trade war so far,\u201d economists Jason Turvey and James Swanston wrote on Sept. 20. \u201cMore important to the rest of the world, though, would be the resulting surge in oil prices and increased uncertainty, which would add to the headwinds already facing the global economy.\"\n\nThey believe Iran would respond to the onset of war by \u201cstepping up disruption of maritime transit through the Strait of Hormuz,\u201d causing Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, to surge to $150 a barrel.
