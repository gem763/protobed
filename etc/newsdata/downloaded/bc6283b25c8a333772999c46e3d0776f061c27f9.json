What we have are partisan theatrics, proceeding under the ipse dixit of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). It raises the profile, but not the legitimacy, of the same \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) previously tried to abracadabra into being without a committee vote.\n\nMoreover, there are no subpoenas. As Secretary Pompeo observed in his fittingly tart response on Tuesday, what the committee chairmen issued was merely a letter. Its huffing and puffing notwithstanding, the letter is nothing more than an informal request for voluntary cooperation. Legally, it has no compulsive power. If anything, it is rife with legal deficiencies.\n\nThe Democrats, of course, hope you don\u2019t notice that the House is not conducting a formal impeachment inquiry. They are using the guise of frenetic activity by several standing committees \u2014 Intelligence, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, Oversight and Reform, Financial Services, and Ways and Means \u2014 whose normal oversight functions are being gussied up to look like serious impeachment business.", "description": "", "authors": ["Andy Mccarthy", "Thehill.Com Opinion White-House"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
