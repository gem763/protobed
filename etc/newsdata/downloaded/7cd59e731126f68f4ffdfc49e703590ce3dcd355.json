Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Bolsonaro was originally written off as a fringe candidate before sweeping the traditional Brazilian parties aside in 2018\u2019s elections.\n\nIn a meeting at the White House earlier this year, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s decision to appoint his son, Eduardo, as the ambassador to the U.S. and later vowed to be a \u201cvoice for Brazil\u201d at the recent Group of Seven meeting in France. Mr. Trump praised Mr. Bolsonaro in the face of withering criticism from Europe over his handling of recent wildfires in the Amazon and for his frankly pro-development views for Brazil\u2019s vast interior lands.\n\nBrazil under Mr. Bolsonaro has emerged as a key player in global debates on climate change, trade and the standoff in neighboring Venezuela.\n\nBut unlike several other G-7 nations, Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s administration has rejected the stance that climate change is a crisis and said outside attempts to dictate Brasilia\u2019s environmental policies was an attack on Brazil\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nIn his speech, Mr. Araujo told an audience of several hundred that some say \u201cthe big threats that our civilization now faces involve climate change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely not true,\u201d he said, saying the world faces an even bigger ideological crisis.\n\n\u201cThere is no climate change catastrophe,\u201d he added. \u201cFrom the debate that is going on it would seem that the world is ending.\u201d\n\nMr. Bolsonaro has pushed for development in the region \u2014 which encompasses 40% of the South America land mass and includes parts of eight countries \u2014 and charged that nongovernmental organizations set a slew of recent wildfires there to protest losing state funding and to paint the government in a bad light. The environmental groups have strongly denied the charges.\n\nThe debate over Brazil\u2019s stewardship of its natural resources is part of a much larger struggle, Mr. Araujo insisted.\n\n\u201cThe Amazon is ground zero for the fight against globalism,\u201d he said, \u201cand for the recovery of the human being and its voice.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
