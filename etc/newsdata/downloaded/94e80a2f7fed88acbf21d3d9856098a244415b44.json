Orientalists were largely 19th century European artists, and Hamdi Bey was the only Middle Eastern painter to have worked in this same Western style.\n\nThe Connoisseur by Ludwig Deutsch Courtesy of Bonhams\n\nHe began to study painting under the great French Orientalists Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me and Gustave Boulanger, while completing his law studies in Paris in 1860. His paintings were exhibited at the 1867 Paris Exposition Universelle and he continued to paint throughout his life.\n\nAnother masterpiece by Hamdi Bey, Koranic Instruction, 1890, will be featured at Sotheby\u2019s sale of Orientalist paintings from the Najd Collection in London on Oct. 22. It has a presale estimate of between \u00a33 million and \u00a35 million.\n\nYoung Woman Reading was the star lot of Bonhams sale of 19th-century European, Victorian, and British impressionist art, which achieved a total of \u00a311 million.\n\nThree other orientalist works by the Austrian Orientalist painter Ludwig Deutsch all sold far above their estimates. The Qanun Player sold for \u00a31.2 million against a low estimate of \u00a3300,000; The Connoisseur sold for \u00a3337,563 against a low estimate of \u00a3150,000; and The Goza Smoker sold for \u00a31.1 million, which was more than eight times its presale estimate.", "description": "The sale price is more than 10 times its presale estimate by Bonhams", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-111367/social", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
