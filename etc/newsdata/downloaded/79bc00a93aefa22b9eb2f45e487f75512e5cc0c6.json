(AP) \u2014 A grand jury declined to bring charges against an off-duty Los Angeles police officer who fatally shot a mentally ill man who assaulted him in a Southern California Costco warehouse, Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin said Wednesday.\n\nOfficer Salvador Sanchez, a seven-year veteran of the LAPD, opened fire on June 14, fatally shooting Kenneth French and injuring his parents, Russell and Paola French.\n\nHestrin said the results of the investigation were presented to a grand jury this month, and the panel declined to return charges.\n\n\u201cOne of the pieces of information that I think was uncontroverted was that the off-duty officer was struck by Kenneth French \u2014 struck in the head \u2014 and he went down as he was holding his infant child,\u201d Hestrin told a news conference. \u201cAnd it all happened very fast, about less than four seconds from the moment that he (French) struck to the moment that he (Sanchez) fired.\u201d\n\nThe officer believed he had been shot and that there was an active shooter, Hestrin said, citing witnesses who saw him reach to the back of his head multiple times to look for blood.\n\nTen rounds were fired. Four struck Kenneth French, and each parent was hit once.\n\nLawyers for Sanchez have said he acted in self-defense when French attacked him as he was holding his 1\u00bd-year-old son during a shopping trip to the warehouse store in Corona. French knocked him to the ground, Sanchez\u2019s attorney David Winslow has said, and he briefly lost consciousness.\n\nBelieving his life and his son\u2019s life were in \u201cimmediate danger,\u201d Winslow has said, Sanchez fired his handgun. The LAPD is conducting an administrative inquiry into whether Sanchez followed the department\u2019s policies.\n\nDale Galipo, an attorney for the French family, has said Russell and Paola French were trying to explain to the officer that his son had a mental disability when shots rang out. French, 32, of Riverside, had been taken off his medication because of other health complications, which may have affected his behavior that night, Galipo has said.\n\nGalipo has called it an \u201copen-handed push or slap\u201d to the policeman\u2019s back.\n\nThe family has filed a claim \u2014 a precursor to a lawsuit \u2014 against Sanchez and the Los Angeles Police Department. A Riverside County judge has issued an order that keeps surveillance footage and cellphone video out of the public eye for one year because of the investigation.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A grand jury declined to bring charges against an off-duty Los Angeles police officer who fatally shot a mentally ill man who assaulted him in a Southern California Costco warehouse, Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin said Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/Off_Duty_Officer_Fatal_Shooting_77110.jpg-cfeb6_c0-112-2681-1675_s1770x1032.jpg?fba616ffeabf9d37d35ae7ad97e85c9329f9140e", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
