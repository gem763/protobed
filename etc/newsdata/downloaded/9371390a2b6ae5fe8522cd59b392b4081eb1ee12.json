It comes with hurricane season ramping up, even as Puerto Rico and other parts of the country lag in recovery efforts following devastating storms over the past two years.\n\nDemocratic leadership this week criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s prioritization of hardline immigration policies over disaster preparation and relief. But Trump has ignored those comments, focusing instead on Puerto Rico, a long-running source of ire for the White House.\n\nWith Dorian \u2014 currently a tropical storm with the potential to become a hurricane \u2014 drawing nearer to the United States, Trump on Wednesday morning tweeted that, \u201cas usual,\u201d Puerto Rico would likely face extreme weather. The president\u2019s comments referenced Hurricane Maria in 2017, which left the island completely devastated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFEMA and all others are ready, and will do a great job. When they do, let them know it, and give them a big Thank You \u2013 Not like last time. That includes from the incompetent Mayor of San Juan!\u201d wrote Trump. Puerto Ricans have repeatedly criticized the president for his handling of Maria, with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz among the loudest naysayers.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest remarks followed a Tuesday tweet, in which the president wrote, \u201cYet another big storm heading to Puerto Rico. Will it ever end?\u201d\n\nTrump has historically claimed \u2014 falsely \u2014 that Puerto Rico has received $91 billion in aid from the U.S. government, using the number as a justification for blocking more funds for the island. He appeared to return to that line of argument with his tweets on Tuesday. \u201cCongress approved 92 Billion Dollars for Puerto Rico last year, an all time record of its kind for \u2018anywhere,'\u201d he asserted.\n\nAs a small island off the southeastern U.S. coast, Puerto Rico is disproportionately vulnerable to hurricanes. A slow recovery from Maria has also left the island in poor condition to respond to yet another hurricane.\n\nAs part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), FEMA has endured repeated criticism over the agency\u2019s botched response to Maria, with internal findings showing FEMA was deeply understaffed and ill-prepared to deal with a disaster on the scale of the Category 5 hurricane at the time. Since the departure of agency head Brock Long earlier this year, FEMA also remains without a permanent administrator.\n\nDuring a hearing this June, acting FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor admitted that the agency was \u201cshort a few thousand employees\u201d with Atlantic hurricane season already underway. Long, the agency\u2019s former head, told E&E in a recent interview that the agency \u201cis dying a death by 1,000 cuts\u201d as it struggles to overcome staffing and budget challenges, as well as a lack of direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, FEMA is set for another blow. Trump administration officials on Tuesday said that $271 million in funds will be moved from several agencies to support border enforcement. Of that amount, $155 million will come from FEMA, while the rest will come from the U.S. Coast Guard and other sources.\n\nWhen DHS notified Congress about the transfer in July, officials said that \u201cabsent significant new catastrophic events\u201d FEMA\u2019s disaster relief fund is expected to operate smoothly without the additional money.\n\nDemocrats, however, have slammed the decision. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) called the move \u201cstunningly reckless\u201d and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) panned the White House\u2019s priorities.\n\n\u201cTaking these critical funds from disaster preparedness and recovery efforts threatens lives and weakens the government\u2019s ability to help Americans in the wake of natural disasters,\u201d Schumer said. Organizations including Amnesty International similarly criticized the Trump administration\u2019s actions as \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\nMoving money around between federal agencies is common and, under Trump, DHS has directed millions from FEMA and others to ICE. But the looming prospect of Dorian is likely to heighten tensions, particularly in Puerto Rico.\n\nDorian approaches Puerto Rico.

The National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that Dorian will likely gain some speed before passing over Puerto Rico on Wednesday. The U.S. Virgin Islands are also bracing for rain and flooding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut things could worsen from there. An updated forecast has Dorian regaining speed and strengthening to a Category 2 hurricane as it moves past the islands and heads towards Florida, potentially hitting as early as Sunday.\n\nTrump, for his part, continued tweeting late into Wednesday morning, taking aim at Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cPuerto Rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth,\u201d the president declared. \u201cAnd by the way, I\u2019m the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to Puerto Rico!\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1164417988.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
