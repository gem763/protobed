Contacts of potentially infected persons must be quarantined and the public warned to step up precautions like handwashing.\n\nWHO said in a statement late on Saturday that it was made aware on Sept. 10 of the death of a patient in Dar es Salaam, and unofficially told the next day that the person tested positive for Ebola. The woman had died on Sept. 8.\n\n\u201cIdentified contacts of the deceased were unofficially reported to be quarantined in various sites in the country,\u201d the statement said.\n\nWHO said it was unofficially told that Tanzania had two other possible Ebola cases. One had tested negative and there was no information on the other.\n\nOfficially, the Tanzanian government said last weekend it had no confirmed or suspected cases of Ebola. The government did not address the death of the woman directly and did not provide further information.\n\nDespite several requests, \u201cclinical data, results of the investigations, possible contacts and potential laboratory tests performed ... have not been communicated to WHO\u201d, the U.N. agency said.\n\n\u201cThe limited available official information from Tanzanian authorities represents a challenge.\u201d\n\nOfficials in Tanzania\u2019s health ministry could not be reached for comment.\n\nAuthorities in east and central Africa have been on high alert for possible spillovers of Ebola from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where a year-long outbreak has killed more than 2,000 people.\n\nThe WHO was heavily criticised by experts during West Africa\u2019s 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic, which claimed more than 11,300 lives in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, for not moving more quickly to contain the outbreak, which remains the world\u2019s worst.\n\nFEARS SPREAD\n\nLast week the U.S. health secretary, Alex Azar, criticised Tanzania for failing to share information on the possible outbreak. The next day he sent a senior health official to Tanzania.\n\nUganda has already recorded several cases after sick patients crossed the border from Congo. A quick government response there prevented the disease spreading.\n\nThe 34-year-old woman who died in Dar es Salaam had travelled to Uganda, according to a leaked WHO document circulated earlier this month. She showed signs of Ebola including headache, fever, rash and bloody diarrhoea on Aug. 10 and died on Sept. 8.\n\nTanzania relies heavily on tourism and an outbreak of Ebola would likely discourage visitors.\n\nThe WHO statement is not the first time international organisations have queried information from the government of President John Magufuli, nicknamed The Bulldozer.\n\nEarlier this year, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund contradicted the government\u2019s economic growth figure for 2018.
