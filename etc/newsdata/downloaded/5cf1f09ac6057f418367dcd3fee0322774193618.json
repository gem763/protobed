An artery-opening procedure like the one Mr Sanders had, and placing stents, which are tiny scaffolds to keep the artery open, restores blood flow and helps prevent future problems.\n\nThe statements from Mr Sanders and his doctors do not indicate whether his heart suffered any permanent damage, or the extent of any damage.\n\nThe sooner blood flow is restored, the better the chance of survival without damage, which is why heart experts urge anyone thinking they might be having a heart attack to call an ambulance.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders had a heart attack, his campaign confirmed as the Vermont senator was released from a Nevada hospital on Friday.", "authors": ["Our Foreign Staff", "Janet Daley", "Juliet Samuel", "Michael Deacon", "Sarah Champion"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/05/TELEMMGLPICT000212028591-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
