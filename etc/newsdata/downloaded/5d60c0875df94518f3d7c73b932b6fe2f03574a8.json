A sawn-off shotgun, with the bullets still inside. She has also found human remains, which must be reported to the police.\n\nMaiklem says she never sells what she finds, and it is the \"historical contact\" that she loves.\n\nAmong her favourite finds are bent sixpence coins from the 17th and 18th centuries, thrown into the river as love tokens for those who could not afford a ring.\n\n\"People who have been forgotten by history, who didn't leave anything of themselves other than the things they lost along the way -- this is what they left behind of themselves,\" she said.\n\n- Instagram, museum interest -\n\nMaiklem has just published a book, \"Mudlarking\", and also chronicles her finds on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram -- part of a thriving social media community of mudlarks.\n\n\"When I don't know what something is and I post it, I'm always blown away by the knowledge that comes back,\" she said.\n\nMudlarks also work with the Museum of London to help identify and preserve their finds, with some currently on display at its \"Secret Rivers\" exhibition.\n\n\"The Thames is the city's longest archaeological site, but it is vulnerable, it is fragile, and the mudlarks do excellent work at recording and helping to save that information,\" curator Kate Sumnall told AFP.\n\n- 'Smells disgusting' -\n\nAlthough social media has fuelled interest in mudlarking, it is not for everyone.\n\nMudlarks must first get a licence from the Port of London Authority (PLA), with around 1,500 people allowed to take part at any one time, although only a few dozen are regularly active.\n\nThe licences stipulate how deep mudlarks are allowed to delve and geographical limits are also in place, with some areas off limits for security or archaeological reasons.\n\nMaiklem neither digs nor uses a metal detector, preferring to focus on what washes up on the shore.\n\nAnd while a wander along the water brings a peace rarely found in the city, it can be a grim task.\n\nThe Thames is far cleaner than it used to be but London's creaking 19th-century sewer system often overflows into the river.\n\nThe PLA also warns mudlarks that they must be aware of hypodermic needles and glass.\n\n\"After heavy rain on a sewage spill day the foreshore is revolting,\" Maiklem said, noting she wears plastic gloves.\n\n\"It's covered in unmentionable things and it smells disgusting.\"", "description": "Treading her way along the muddy banks of the River Thames, Lara Maiklem spots a 16th-century clothespin which she wipes and adds to a row of others puncturing her coat pocket.  \"Mudlarks\" have scoured the foreshores of London's rivers for centuries, searching out lost or discarded items", "authors": ["Alice Ritchie"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5HVnK4nqENt7.ORAVk6HeQ--~B/aD01MTI7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_sg/News/AFP/609861cd19c26b09bac170b6481177a683689710.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
