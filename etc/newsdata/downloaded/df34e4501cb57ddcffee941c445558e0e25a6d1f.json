Consumer Reports has revealed that the tech giant\u2019s iPhone 11 Pro Max is the top-rated handset on the market, followed by the iPhone 11 Pro (left)\n\nIn previous years, it was always Samsung or Google who took home the crown in Consumer Report\u2019s testing, but Apple has taken the title for the first time in history.\n\nThe report starts with the \u2018more-than-impressive\u2019 40.5 hours of battery life, which is Consumer Reports \u2018longest stretch any phone currently listed\u2019 with its ratings.\n\nFACT BOX TITLE LONGER BATTERY LIFE The Pro Max\u2019s battery lasted for an impressive 40.5 hours and the Pro went 34 hours on a single charge. BETTER CAMERAS The new design allows for a wide, ultrawide and 2X. The cameras are capable of taking stunning pictures in low-light settings with the new Night Mode -- something Google Pixel phones have been using for a while. There\u2019s also a slow-motion selfie, or Slofie, mode. Our testers tried out both features and found that they work pretty well. DURABILITY The iPhone 11 Pro Max made it through 100 drops with just minor scratches. The iPhone 11 Pro's display was broken and not working after 50 drops.\n\nApple attributes these improvements to the energy-efficiency it programmed into its new processor.\n\nDuring the battery life testing, Consumer Reports used a robotic finger designed to put the phone through a range of tasks designed to simulate a consumer\u2019s average day.\n\nIt browsed the web, took pictures, used GPS navigation and made phone calls.\n\nFollowing the tests, the Pro Max\u2019s battery lasted for an impressive 40.5 hours, which is 11 hours more than the iPhone XS Max.\n\nThe 11 Pro went 34 hours on a single charge, up from the 27.5 hours of the iPhone XS.\n\nIn addition to a longer battery life, Apple also made improvements to its charging technology, as both handsets include an 18-watt charger with the 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max \u2013 helping your battery reach 100 percent more quickly.\n\nApple has received a lot of criticism for the look of the new camera on the iPhone Pro and Pro Max \u2013 it has been said to look like a coconut, bowling ball and other interesting things.\n\nAnd it has sparked fear among those with tryophobia.\n\nOne fan shared on Twitter: 'The new iPhone is creeping me TF out with the 3 little cameras #Trypophobia.'\n\nBut the new design allows for a wide, ultrawide and 2X.\n\nThe cameras are capable of taking stunning pictures in low-light settings with the new Night Mode -- something Google Pixel phones have been using for a while.\n\nThere\u2019s also a slow-motion selfie, or Slofie, mode. Our testers tried out both features and found that they work pretty well.\n\nApple, Google and Samsung phones all passed the water-resistance tests, but the 11 Pro didn\u2019t survive a ride in the tumbler.\n\nThe tumbler is a rotating chamber that repeatedly drops a phone from a height of about 2.5 feet.\n\nIPHONE PRO SPECS Comes with 5.8 or 6.5-inch display Start at $1,749 for Pro, $1,899 Pro Max Runs on A13 Bionic Chip Three cameras: Wide, Ultra-wide, Telephoto Available with 64GB, 256GB and 512GB storage Comes in midnight green, space gray, silver, and gold\n\nThe phone is checked for damage after 50 drops and then again after 100.\n\nThe goal is to expose it to impacts from a wide variety of angles.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro Max made it through 100 drops with just minor scratches, but the iPhone 11 Pro display was smashed and not working properly after just 50 drops.\n\n'That said, if you buy any of these three phones, snapping on an inexpensive case is always a good idea,' Consumer Reports noted.\n\n'Even the best phones can break, and getting them fixed can be expensive.'\n\nApple also ranked the highest for fastest processor, as it boasts the cutting edge A13 Bionic chip.\n\n'Our testers also evaluated the phones\u2019 displays and found them to be exceptionally bright, though not visibly sharper than those of last year\u2019s,' shared Consumer Reports.\n\nThe firm also noted that the speakers are louder than prior models, it is suggested to connect to headphones or a wireless speaker.\n\n\u2018If you already own an iPhone XS, XS Max, or even an XR, you can probably save your money and wait,\u2019 shared Consumer Reports.\n\n\u2018Huge jumps in battery life and new cameras aside, there just might not be enough in the way of new features to justify spending $1,000 or more on a whole new phone.\u2019\n\n\u2018If you are ready for an upgrade, though, these phones are high-performing, sleek machines.\u2019\n\n\u2018And if you want to save some scratch, don\u2019t forget the $700 iPhone 11.\n\n\u2018Opt for one of those and you miss out on an OLED display, a 2X rear camera, and a superfast charger, along with crazy long battery life. But not everyone needs those frills.\u2019", "description": "Consumer Reports revealed Apple's iPhone 11 Pro Max is the top-rated handset on the market, followed by the iPhone 11 Pro.
