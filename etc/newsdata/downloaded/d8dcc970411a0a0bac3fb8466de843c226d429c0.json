The answer remains unclear, but he could certainly do with a pick-me-up after a season that has turned more sour than a worm-eaten apple. So Antwerp \u2013 the city where Edmund claimed his maiden ATP title last year \u2013 would be a sensible place to start.\n\nOn Monday in Shanghai, Edmund lost in straight sets to Jeremy Chardy. He did not play terrible tennis, exactly. But neither did he ever switch on the afterburners that had carried him to within striking distance of the world\u2019s top 10 last year. And the worst thing? Nobody was surprised, for it has been the same story for most of 2019. Edmund is now on a six-match losing streak, dating back to Aug 6. When the new set of rankings are published, his 19-month possession of the British No 1 spot will end.\n\nSo, what has happened to the young outsider who reached the Australian Open semi-finals last season? The giant-killer who overpowered Novak Djokovic in Madrid three months later? The rising star who then rampaged through the Asian swing, scoring six wins in a fortnight before returning to Europe and outlasting Gael Monfils in the Antwerp final?", "description": "Will Kyle Edmund be returning to Antwerp next week?", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/07/TELEMMGLPICT000212298506-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq35mikMYd2GZS309uQ090NqTUr-a8TLOkgi5NcfN3ifE.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
