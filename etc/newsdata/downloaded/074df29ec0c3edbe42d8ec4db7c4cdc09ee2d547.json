No, he's not the reason one way or the other they got there. Current Nats explain. USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 We are going to see some old-school baseball in this 115th World Series featuring the Houston Astros and Washington Nationals.\n\nYou want pitching the way it was meant to be \u2013 you know, where starters are actually starters and relievers are relievers? You\u2019ve got it.\n\nIt\u2019s all-world Gerrit Cole vs. future Hall of Famer Max Scherzer in Game 1.\n\nIt\u2019s future Hall of Famer Justin Verlander and all-world Stephen Strasburg in Game 2.\n\nIt\u2019s 238-stirkeout lefty Patrick Corbin vs. future Hall of Famer Zack Greinke in Game 3.\n\n\u201cWhat this is, is the making of a classic,\u2019\u2019 former World Series champion manager Jim Leyland told USA TODAY Sports. \"Everybody is looking forward to this. It\u2019s great for baseball. Look at the matchups. It\u2019s baseball at its best, and the way the game was meant to be played.\n\n\u201cYou need horses to win championships. What I personally believe is that your best bullpen is a seven-inning starter. You\u2019re then only using your bullpen because you want to, not because you have to.\n\n\u201cThese two teams are proving how valuable good starting pitching means to teams. This has got a chance to be a hell of a matchup.\u2019\u2019\n\nNATIONALS: History not on Washington's side after LCS sweep\n\nRENDON: Nationals' MVP candidate returns to his home town\n\nThis will be the first World Series since 1945 to have six starting pitchers who finished the year among the top 20 in ERA, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, with four in the top 10\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely old-school style,\u2019\u2019 Nationals second baseman Brian Dozier said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be no openers or any of that stuff. When you get to this stage it seems like its always the best of the best, but it really is. This is truly the best pitching in the game.\"\n\nIt\u2019s the first time that five of the top-10 strikeout pitchers in the regular season will meet in the World Series, led by Cole and Verlander, who finished 1-2, with these two teams also finishing first and second in total strikeouts.\n\nThe last World Series featuring the top two strikeout pitching staffs was in 2001 when the Arizona Diamondbacks and New York Yankees met, featuring the likes of Randy Johnson, Curt Schilling, Roger Clemens and Mike Mussina.\n\n\u201cWell,\u2019\u2019 says Astros MVP candidate Alex Bregman, \u201cat least it gives you an excuse if you go 0-for-4.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe laughed.\n\nWell, kind of.\n\n\u201cHey, if you want to win the World Series, and be the best,\u2019\u2019 Nationals first baseman Ryan Zimmermann says, \"you\u2019re going to have to beat the best. And these are the best.\u2019\u2019\n\nGerrit Cole and Max Scherzer will start Game 1. (Photo: USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAstros manager A.J. Hinch, who watched the Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees intensely utilize their bullpens in the last two rounds, will know what to do with himself in the World Series. He and Nationals manager Davey Martinez can sit back, put their feet up, and watch these starters go deep into games every night.\n\n\u201cI think they should take their starter out after the third inning, to be honest,\" Hinch joked.\n\nConsidering the Nationals bullpen had a 5.66 ERA during the season, the Astros may lay out the red carpet for the Nats\u2019 relievers.\n\n\u201cYou definitely have to have some guys there to pitch deep in games, because if your starters only go a couple of innings,\u2019\u2019 Corbin said, \u201cthat\u2019s a lot of innings you\u2019re going to have to eat up, especially in a seven-game series. It catches up to teams. If your bullpen is throwing six to seven innings, it\u2019s going to be pretty tough.\u2019\u2019\n\nIndeed, there\u2019s a reason two teams with dominant rotations are the last ones standing. You can try \"bullpenning\" in small stretches, but eventually it catches up.\n\nIt was the Milwaukee Brewers\u2019 woefully thin starting rotation that eventually caught up with them, with reliever Josh Hader unable to protect a two-run lead in the wild-card game, which would have eliminated the Nationals three weeks ago.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why this matchup is so good for the game,\u2019\u2019 Nationals catcher Kurt Suzuki says. \u201cThe two teams that are playing in the World Series went out and got the best starting pitchers in the game, and look at what they got now. So hopefully it doesn\u2019t shy teams away from shelling money out for good starting pitching. You need it. You rely on your bullpen, you\u2019re going to kill these bullpen guys, and shorten their careers. Teams are putting a lot of stress on their arms.\n\n\u201cLook at Hader. He has a lot of innings, and its only his second full season in the big leagues. Poor guy.\"\n\nYet, with the innings that Astros and Nationals\u2019 starting rotations racked up, their bullpens were largely spared the stress, and feel relatively fresh for late October.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we won in 2017,\u2019\u2019 Astros reliever Will Harris said, \u201chaving that strong starting rotation. It allows A.J. not to have to extend any of us. Really, it\u2019s like having a good quarterback in the NFL. The whole team feeds off it.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut who knows, , it might make life a little easier for hitters knowing they won\u2019t have to see a different pitcher every time they step to the plate.\n\n\u201cI'm the last person that's going to tell you it's 'easier' to face Scherzer and Strasburg in the first couple games,\u2019\u2019 Hinch said, \u201cjust because they're traditional pitchers. We\u2019ll see how much 'easier,' it is to face a guy a second and third time, but with the type of pitching that we're going to face out of the rotation with the Nats, I'm not sure you can use the word 'easier.'\n\n\u201cIf you want to do well against the Nats, you've got to beat their starters, and then make them make decisions as the game goes on. If you sit back and kind of wait for the bullpen, you'll look at Strasburg and Scherzer throwing 120, 130 pitches and you'll be too deep in the game to make up a difference.\n\n\u201cThose guys getting 21, 24, 27 outs is a real possibility for them.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd it\u2019s not only a possibility, but a virtual guarantee for Cole, who\u2019s on one of the most incredible runs in history. The dude is 19-0 with a 1.59 ERA in his last 25 starts.\n\nNow, he\u2019ll be taking his act to baseball\u2019s biggest stage, where he\u2019ll be making his first World Series appearance \u2013 after watching his first one as an 11-year-old kid in 2001, rooting for the Yankees.\n\n\u201cIt was probably the only time most people felt some empathy for the Yankees,\u2019\u2019 Cole said. \u201cThat was an unbelievable series getting to watch Randy and Curt Schilling work. I personally am a big fan of starting pitching. I grew up wanting to become a starting pitcher and I'm a starting pitcher now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stuff you dream as a little kid.\u2019\u2019\n\nJust like back in the day, says Astros pitcher Collin McHugh.\n\n\u201cI grew up watching [Greg] Maddux, [Tom] Glavine and Smoltz in the 90\u2019s watching them go against those Yankees starters,\u2019\u2019 McHugh says, \u201cand this will be like bringing back old-school baseball memories. We need that in 2019. I think it\u2019s a fun, new way of watching baseball that probably a lot of young fans haven\u2019t been able to like sink their teeth into for awhile.\n\n\u201cBullpens have been in vogue the last few years, but to go out there and see the anomaly, seeing the horses go through a lineup three times, and get better as the game goes on, it\u2019s going to be fun.\n\n\u201cAny team in baseball would love to have the embarrassment of riches these two teams have.\u2019\u2019\n\nFollow Bob Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale", "description": "We're in for a treat in the World Series.
