While analysts advise us to keep our eyes on the price formation on large Asian exchanges, XRP jumped the highest among the top 10 on Monday, BAT jumped after Brave's major news, six coins in the top 50 went up by two digits, BNB jumped too following Binance\u2019s and Amun\u2019s ETP launch, and we learned that there\u2019s big money coming for BTC. But mid-week, the market turned red, and ETH was one of its first victims. We discussed what BTC halving might mean for miners, and we\u2019ve also seen that Pyongyang cyber-criminals becoming more skilfull as crypto thieves. And as Binance reached USD 1bn in profit, their CEO is confused over the price of BNB.\n\nMeanwhile, G7 went to war over control for money; central banks realized they can't ignore crypto anymore; Coinbase said they were granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of Ireland; and Telegram postponed the launch of its TON and Gram after SEC's regulatory move. And while this has been happening, Venezuela will hand out millions in Petro, Bermuda has its own crypto surprise, and Ripple made three crypto wallet-related steps that might help XRP reach a wider audience. We\u2019ve also learned that five giants will begin a pilot for a blockchain-powered vehicle identification platform.\n\nFinally, security experts discussed an 'ideal' security setup, 6 crypto experts told us what might encourage people to use Bitcoin, and Lil Bubble talked to us about his music and about the Cryptoverse. Also, if you'd like to buy a charming 19th-century church, you can do so for 180 BTC.\n\nAnd now, the jokes.\n\n__________\n\nThey must!
