Tell Kmart this is beyond inappropriate and offensive and that they have a social responsibility to pull this item off their shelves immediately,\u201d the petition reads.\n\n\u201cEach year, 12 million children (girls as young as 6 years old \u2013 the same size as this \u201ccostume\u201d) are sold or married off by their family without their consent.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one million child marriages per month!\u201d\n\nKmart promptly responded to the backlash by removing the costume from shelves and issued the following statement via nine.com.au:\n\n\u201cKmart Australia regrets the decision to range the bride costume (ages 4-6 years), it was not intended to cause offence and we sincerely apologise. We have made the decision to withdraw this product and we encourage customers who have product concerns or feedback, to please get in contact with our Kmart Customer Service team.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, not all punters were in agreement that the dress should be banned from stores.\n\nOne change.org user wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s a costume \u2026 untwist your knickers and get on with your life,\u201d while another declared: \u201cLet kids be kids.\u201d", "description": "Kmart has been forced to remove a children's bride Halloween costume from shelves after receiving backlash from parents of Australia.", "authors": ["Matt Galea"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-24-at-2.57.49-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
