But that shouldn\u2019t throw cold water on the Federal Reserve\u2019s expected rate cut next week, economists say.\n\nThe core consumer price index, which doesn\u2019t account for food and energy prices, rose 2.4% year-over-year as of August, exceeding the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target. Within the CPI, prices for used cars and medical goods and services all increased.\n\nBut the consumer price index isn\u2019t the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation - the personal consumption expenditure price index (PCE) is. That index calculates inflation differently.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during the \"The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\" panel discussion hosted by the Swiss Institute of International Studies at the University of Zurich in Zurich, Switzerland September 6, 2019. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann More\n\n\u201cHealthcare is important; medical care services surged 0.9% in CPI but that won't happen in PCE,\u201d wrote Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research, in a note to clients following the CPI\u2019s release. \u201cCPI covers out of pocket expenses only while PCE covers payments made on behalf of you.\u201d\n\nDutta is expecting a 1.7% rise in core PCE for August, which would be below the Fed\u2019s 2% target. That figure is scheduled to be released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis later this month.\n\nTypically, the Fed cuts interest rates to spur or create inflation, hence why some market participants may question the idea of a near-term rate cut after reading Thursday\u2019s inflation report.\n\n\u201c[The CPI reading] won\u2019t stop the Fed from cutting interest rates again next week, but it does provide further reason to believe that market expectations of significant further easing will ultimately be disappointed,\u201d wrote Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients Thursday.\n\nEuropean Central Bank cuts interest rates\n\nAs the market awaits next week\u2019s Fed decision, the European Central Bank on Thursday announced a cut to its deposit rate - the first cut in three years.\n\nThat prompted admiration from President Trump on Twitter, who has long criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for raising rates too fast last year and not following other central banks around the world, like the ECB, in providing more monetary stimulus.\n\nHere\u2019s what President Trump tweeted following the ECB announcement:\n\n\u201cEuropean Central Bank, acting quickly, Cuts Rates 10 Basis Points.. They are trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar, hurting U.S. exports.... And the Fed sits, and sits, and sits. They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!\u201d\n\nYahoo Finance More\n\nMorning Brief More\n\nScott Gamm is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
