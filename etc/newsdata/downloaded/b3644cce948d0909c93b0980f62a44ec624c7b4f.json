MP Sir Oliver Letwin added an amendment to the Benn Act on Saturday preventing an \u201caccidental\u201d hard Brexit on 31st October if the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) had not passed through Parliament by then. Although PM Johnson appeared to have the numbers to adopt the new withdrawal agreement, even sans the DUP, Parliament does not trust him enough not to engage in some hard-Brexit chicanery after the meaningful vote, by delaying the WAB until after the 31st October.\n\nThe vote was cancelled, and the Prime Minister has duly sent an unsigned letter asking the EU for an extension; accompanied by a signed letter effectively saying the first had was sent with a legislative gun at his head.\n\nThe plot has thickened after the abortive Super Saturday, with Labour and the sidelined Democratic Unionist Party allegedly conspiring to insert a permanent EU customs union into the withdrawal agreement that will now be voted on either today or tomorrow. If passed it would set Brexit back to square one as it would be untenable to the government.\n\nEurope may yet have a part to play as well. Although an extension will almost certainly be granted, it isn\u2019t beyond the realm of possibility that \u201cconditions\u201d may be attached to it. An election or a fresh referendum spring to mind as an exasperated Europe despairs at Westminster ever sorting this out itself.\n\nSterling has dropped by one per cent to 1.2870 this morning on the last news. The damage was limited by the fact that, despite more twists and turns than any other soap opera in history, a hard Brexit is now highly unlikely. Sterling traders can likely look forward to a choppy headline-driven range of 1.2800 to 1.3200 for at least the first part of the week.\n\nCanada goes to the polls today with the result too close to call and a minority coalition government a virtual certainty. The ECB meets on Thursday with no changes expected to the \u201cspray and pray\u201d easing policy. Assistance from the fiscal side from European governments being as far away as ever. Thursday also sees US durable goods with the market fretting over signs of trade-war slowdowns.\n\nThe US earnings season continues this week after Wall Street closed with a whimper on Friday. Revelations that a Boeing (NYSE: ) 737-Max test pilot experienced MCAS problems on a simulator but thought it was a simulator fault; it wasn\u2019t. The revelations torpedoed Boeing\u2019s share price dragging Wall Street down. Otherwise, earnings have held up well in the face of trade-war worries. Industrial bellwethers such as Caterpillar (NYSE: ) report this week and they may change that rosy picture. Wednesday is looming as peak reporting for the week with a procession of heavyweights such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reporting.\n\nCloser to home, Japans balance of trade has shrunk to Yen123 billion. Worrying both exports and imports have shrunk more than expected, suggesting the global slowdown hasn\u2019t gone away.\n\nChina announces its 1-year loan prime rate today at 1030 SGT, which is expected to drop to 4.05% from 4.20% previously. No move will likely disappoint mainland stock markets which are banking on targeted stimulus from the central government to mollify the effects of the global slowdown.\n\nTomorrow, South Korea releases its PPI and Thailand releases its balance of trade. Both will be monitored for signs that the regional slowdown, exacerbated by the US-China trade war, is alive and well.\n\nBrexit\u2019s end-game (or not), and US earnings will dominate financial markets thoughts this week. Of the two, earnings should carry greater importance, but everyone loves a good cliffhanger to a British drama show.\n\nEquities\n\nBoeing\u2019s dramas mostly dragged Wall Street lower on Friday, rather than weak US earnings, although a soft China GDP print did not help sentiment. That should limit the fallout in Asia today as we await the China Prime Loan Rate this morning.\n\nThe fell 0.39%, the fell 0.83%, and the fell 0.94%. The sentiment is evenly slit in Asia this morning with the cautiously higher by 0.22%, but the , lower by 0.20%. Barring a surprise from China, that midset will likely pervade in Asia this session, as it awaits for more precise direction from Europe and North America.\n\nCurrencies\n\nTreasury yields fell on Friday as markets hedged possible weekend event risk. The and performed strongly as at that stage; a positive Brexit resolution looked on the cards with the UK Parliament vote. The eased overall with the dollar index falling 0.34% to 97.27.\n\nThat Brexit sentiment has taken a hit today, with GBP falling from a close of 1.2980 to 1.2910 this morning. Euro is mostly unchanged at 1.1160. Around the region, and remain steady at 0.6855 and 0.6390, near their New York closes.\n\nThe ranges this morning imply that most of the action in currency markets regionally today will be confined to the GBP and GBP-crosses.\n\nOil had a relatively quiet session on Friday, easing slightly on the lower Chinese GDP and global growth fears. The growth fears look set to limit any gains in oil realistically, set against a supply/demand background where supplies globally remain ample.\n\nspot fell 1.0% to $59.50 a barrel, and WTI spot fell 0.65% to $53.70 a barrel. WTI has slightly by 0.10% in early trading, but both contracts are set for a quiet start to the week as we await market-moving inputs from other time-zones.\n\nGold had a non-descript session on Friday, closing almost unchanged at $1490.50 an ounce. The opening has been much the same in Asia with gold failing even to catch its usual risk-hedging tailwind on Friday.\n\nLonger-term support and resistance continue at $1474.00 and $1520.00 an ounce, respectively. Until one of these levels broken on a daily basis, gold\u2019s long slumber is set to continue.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by MarketPulse (Jeffrey Halley) covering: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, AUD/USD, XAU/USD.
