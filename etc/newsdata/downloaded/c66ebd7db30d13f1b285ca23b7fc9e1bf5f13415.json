The whistleblower\u2019s identity has remained anonymous, though it\u2019s been revealed that the person came from the U.S. government\u2019s intelligence community.\n\n\u201cA responsible whistleblower makes all Americans safer by ensuring that serious wrongdoing can be investigated and addressed, thus advancing the cause of national security to which we have devoted our careers,\u201d the former officials, including former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan and former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, wrote in the letter.\n\nNew: 90 former national security officials who served under Dem and GOP presidents, including Trump, publish open letter saying whistleblower followed the law and deserves protection + anonymity.\n\n\n\n\"A responsible whistleblower makes all Americans safer.\"\n\nhttps://t.co/wACj12ZP34 pic.twitter.com/PMsrmqMuRV \u2014 Dustin Volz (@dnvolz) October 7, 2019\n\nThe letter comes as Trump and his allies work to denounce the whistleblower\u2019s complaint regarding his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The complaint, which cites several unnamed senior White House officials, accuses the president of pressuring Zelensky to investigate potential political rival former Vice President Joe Biden, whose son Hunter previously had business dealings in Ukraine. Reports of the call led to the House launching a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nA summary of the call released by the White House largely corroborates the whistleblower\u2019s allegations, which include that the president threatened to take away U.S. military aid from Ukraine if the country didn\u2019t investigate Biden. Trump, who has repeatedly described the call as \u201cperfect,\u201d later said on camera that both Ukraine and China should investigate Biden for unsubstantiated claims of corruption.\n\nTrump has pushed a a conspiracy theory suggesting the rules for whistleblowers changed before the Ukraine whistleblower came forward with the complaint. The president alleged the rules previously didn\u2019t allow whistleblowers to report secondhand information, which is what the whistleblower\u2019s complaint is comprised of\n\nBut experts, including the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general who reviewed the complained, said that whistleblowers have always been allowed to report on secondhand information.\n\nThe president has also falsely accused the whistleblower of \u201ctreason\u201d because of the complaint, making veiled threats that the whistleblower should be \u201cdealt with\u201d in violent ways for releasing the information. The president has repeatedly said he \u201cdeserved\u201d to meet the whistleblower and find out the person\u2019s identity.\n\nThe former officials who penned the letter said they \u201capplaud the whistleblower.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs such, he or she has by law the right \u2015 and indeed the responsibility \u2015 to make known, through appropriate channels, indications of serious wrongdoing,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThat is precisely what this whistleblower did; and we applaud the whistleblower not only for living up to that responsibility but also for using precisely the channels made available by federal law for raising such concerns.\u201d\n\nThey said a whistleblower should be \u201cprotected from certain egregious forms of retaliation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever one\u2019s view of the matters discussed in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, all Americans should be united in demanding that all branches of our government and all outlets of our media protect this whistleblower and his or her identity,\u201d the wrote.\n\nFederal law says Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson cannot disclose the whistleblower\u2019s identity without the person\u2019s consent, unless it is determined \u201cunavoidable during the course of the investigation.\u201d The law also says the whistleblower should not face any \u201caction constituting a reprisal, or threat of reprisal\u201d unless the whistleblower falsified the report.", "description": "The letter, signed by 90 former officials, also stressed the importance of protecting the whistleblower's identity, The Wall Street Journal reported.", "authors": ["Sanjana Karanth"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YOBPQ8xS4YvtUVaB_GCzlQ--~B/aD0zMDY3O3c9NDg5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9a9a1a210000b103ab2f21.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
