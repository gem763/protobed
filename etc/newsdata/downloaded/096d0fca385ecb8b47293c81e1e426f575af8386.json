He blew everyone away.\n\n'He just runs at defenders, leaves them for dead, and the finishing is exquisite.'\n\nEx-Spurs striker Peter Crouch also highlighted the performance of Gnabry, as well as fellow wide-man Kingsley Coman - the pair were up against Tottenham full-backs Serge Aurier and Danny Rose.\n\nCrouch said: 'Right from the beginning the full-backs were going to have a long evening unless they doubled up.\n\nTottenham right back Serge Aurier couldn't deal with Gnabry's pace and skill in the second half\n\nOn the other flank Kingsley Coman was also a constant threat against Tottenham's Danny Rose\n\n'Coman and Gnabry were running riot. They were for the full 90 minutes. I don\u2019t know why it wasn\u2019t spotted earlier and nipped in the bud.'\n\nRio Ferdinand, a Champions League winner with Manchester United in 2008, referred to Bayern's experience and deadly finishing.\n\n'Serge Gnabry showed Arsenal what they let go,' Ferdinand told BT Sport.\n\n'Listen we talked about Bayern Munich being a team in transition, they are a team ready and able.\n\n'Wing play of the highest order from their two young wide players. Their undoing was the goal just before half time that was a pivotal moment on the match.\n\nRio Ferdinand, Peter Crouch and Owen Hargreaves were full of praise for Bayern's display\n\nArsenal's Hector Bellerin, who played with Gnabry at the Emirates, tweeted his thoughts\n\n'I loved it, I love seeing good football, I was in here jumping and screaming and enjoying what was on show!\n\n'Mainly the wide players, I love seeing wide players who can do unbelievable movement to get on the ball, move defenders then play and run. When they got in they were clinical.\n\n'From then on this Bayern team looked like a team with experience, ability to control the tempo of the gam - they scored at will today.'\n\nHowever, Ferdinand was less glowing about Tottenham's defending and ball retention.\n\n'As a defender I feel like you are cheating yourself if you dive in,' Ferdinand stated.\n\nFormer defender Ferdinand was unimpressed by Aurier continually diving into tackles\n\nGnabry tears away from Aurier after the Spurs defender lunges in unsuccessfully for the ball\n\n'Aurier is quick enough to run back if he makes a mistake but he dives in and makes up Gnabry\u2019s mind.\n\n'How many mistakes did Tottenham make in possession? Bayern were there to pounce. It was almost comical.'\n\nThe result leaves Bayern top of Group B on six points from two games, with Spurs lying in third on one point, behind Red Star Belgrade on three points in second - Olympiacos are in fourth.", "description": "Gnabry's performance was a lesson in finishing as he contributed to a 7-2 romping of Spurs on Tuesday.
