In Dickinson, the latest streaming project from AppleTV+, Oscar nominee and pop star Hailee Steinfeld, whose single \u201cAfterlife\u201d you hear in the latest trailer, stars as Emily Dickinson, the writer you best know as a possibly queer New England recluse obsessed with death and poetry. Now, Steinfeld\u2019s Dickinson is all of those things (including the queer part, thank God) as well as young, hot, and rebellious. Created and written by Alena Smith (The Affair, The Bad Guys), the series also stars Jane Krakowski, Toby Huss, Anna Baryshnikov, Ella Hunt, and Adrian Blake Enscoe, with a guest cast that includes John Mulaney as Henry David Thoreau and Wiz Khalifa as Death, complete with some 420-esque smoke horse-drawn carriage. Per Apple TV+, \u201cDickinson is a coming-of-age story that finds Emily Dickinson to be an unexpected hero for our millennial era.\u201d Basically, now she\u2019s really into meme embroidery. The series premieres November 1; watch the first trailer below.\n\nRelated", "description": "Watch the trailer for Apple TV+ series \u201cDickinson,\u201d starring Hailee Steinfeld as a young and horny Emily Dickinson.", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/19/19-dickinson.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
