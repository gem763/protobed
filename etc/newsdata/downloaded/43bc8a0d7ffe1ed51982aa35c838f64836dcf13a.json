Today we often define people by asking: Who slept with whom? We\u2019ve decided that sexuality defines us all. But every historian is a diplomat representing yesterday\u2019s lost world to readers today. Good historians speak the language of today without letting the language from yesteryear get lost in translation.\n\nThree movies dazzled the nominators for the 37th Academy Awards in 1965. Mary Poppins had 13 nominations. My Fair Lady and Becket each earned 12. On Oscar night, My Fair Lady won eight awards, Mary Poppins won five, and Becket only one, for best adapted screenplay. In a just world where artistry trumps shtick, Becket would have done better\u2014and be remembered today.\n\nBecket explores the bond that broke eight centuries ago between Thomas Becket, the archbishop of Canterbury, and his friend King Henry II, who appointed him\u2014then had him killed. On screen, the movie crackled thanks to the chemistry between a post-Cleopatra (and post-Elizabeth Taylor-scandal) Richard Burton as Becket and a post-Lawrence of Arabia Peter O\u2019Toole as the King. And underlying those boffo performances was a Glenivillian brilliance illuminating this conflict between two friends and two enterprises that defined Glenville\u2019s life: the church and the crown.\n\nGlenville explained that \u201ca director should, like a conductor, be an interpreter of the particular world of each playwright with whom he works:\u201d sometimes the staging must be \u201cunobtrusive,\u201d sometimes \u201cbroad and colorful.\u201d Additionally, the audience defines the performance by the instruments\u2014the actors\u2014but without an iron-fisted visionary, chaos would erupt.\n\nAs the son of a famous Irish acting duo, Glenville wondered whether to be an actor\u2014or, rather, not to be one. Born in 1913 in London, raised to be posh, Glenville studied with Jesuits in Stonyhurst College, then attended Oxford, where he succumbed to his true love, the theater.\n\nThe fit was not only because of his pedigree but his stunning good looks. He was one of those beautiful men who surrounds himself with beautiful men. In 1958, when he was 45, The New York Times deemed him \u201ceasily the most handsome-looking director one is likely to encounter in Hollywood\u201d (PDF).\n\nA good-enough actor, Glenville braved the London Blitz in West End hits during the early 1940s. Greatness, however, beckoned as a theatrical mastermind. By 1949, he was pond-hopping to conquer Broadway and Hollywood. Over the next 20 years, bringing alive material written by Graham Greene, Tennessee Williams, and Terence Rattigan, he directed Henry Fonda, Laurence Olivier, Anthony Quinn, Jackie Gleason, Vivien Leigh, and a Broadway rookie, Tommy Lee Jones, in 1969. He finally moved to Manhattan in 1960, buying a sumptuous townhouse at 18 East 68th St.\n\nToggling back and forth between the stage and the studio, he balanced the \u201cliterature of ideas\u201d\u2014and of \u201cimages.\u201d Words star in plays, he explained, \u201cbecause physical action is limited by the size of the stage, and the separation between actors and the audience rules out subtleties of expression. In the theater, every word, every gesture must be projected, exaggerated.\u201d In the movies, the visual dominates: \u201cImages become more dramatic than words.\u201d Movies could also reach psychological depth, using close-ups \u201cto show inner thought processes.\u201d\n\nGlenville\u2019s works dramatized his ideological conflicts. His movie The Prisoner in 1955, starring Alec Guinness as a Roman Catholic cardinal interrogated by an Eastern European secret policeman played by Jack Hawkins, anticipated Becket. Once again, two enchanting men delivered charged performances. And once again, Glenville choreographed a \u201cdeadly encounter between a man of God and a man of the State.\u201d\n\nTo Glenville\u2019s amusement, French radicals denounced the film as \u201canti-Communist,\u201d while Irish clerics deemed it \u201canti-Catholic.\u201d A radical individualist, Glenville emphasized the human story of \u201cprize fighters in the realm of the spirit.\u201d This \u201cduel\u201d consumed two \u201cmen of integrity and stature, who fight to the death for what they consider to be right,\u201d he explained in a powerful New York Times essay. Although the interrogator wins, the broken priest\u2019s spirit has been \u201cfortified.\u201d Glenville\u2019s lesson: \u201cpersecution\u201d destroys \u201cthe persecutor\u201d more than \u201cthe victim.\u201d Who then, he asked, \u201cin fact is the prisoner.\u201d\n\nGlenville\u2019s struggle with his devout Catholicism was more personal. Shortly after World War II, he met his life partner, the theatrical producer Hardy William \u201cBill\u201d Smith. They were, as it used to be said, \u201cconfirmed bachelors.\u201d They hobnobbed with gay actors. Glenville\u2019s greatest works bristled with homoerotic energy. Yet Glenville kept his private life, private. Friends said he abhorred flamboyance and was as \u201cstrict as the Bishop of Boston.\u201d Some wondered whether Glenville\u2019s \u201ctotally harmonious\u201d relationship with Smith was celibate. Others speculated that the confessional booth and the movie screen helped him cycle through \u201csin\u201d and \u201csalvation\u201d regularly.\n\nHis struggle against Communism\u2014in fact all totalitarianism\u2014lacked any such ambivalence. In what ended being his last film The Comedians, Glenville mobilized an all-star cast in 1967 to expose \u201cPapa Doc\u201d Duvalier\u2019s reign of terror in Haiti. Despite being based on a Graham Greene novel, despite the talents of Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Alec Guinness, James Earl Jones, Cicely Tsyon, Lillian Gish, and Peter Ustinov, the film sputtered. Hinting at today\u2019s politically correct relativism and identity politics, some liberals even criticized this brave stance against dictatorship for criticizing a black leader\u2014and sensed Glenville cared more about knocking down Black Panthers at home, than Duvalier thugs abroad (PDF).\n\nGlenville stopped at 60 because of the \u201960s. Angry politics on the streets, explicit sex on screens, and Method acting on stage demoralized him. \u201cI\u2019m tired of beating my head against a stone wall,\u201d he said as his productions failed.\n\nHe became one of those men about town, squiring the society columnist Suzy Knickerbocker to a dinner at the Ford White House here, attending a close friend\u2019s Broadway premier there. Leaving New York just frequently enough, he hoped, to avoid paying taxes as a resident, and grumbling about the hard turn left in politics and art, he lived grandly until 1996.\n\nOne of \u201cthe most sought-after stage directors in America,\u201d became \u201cthe forgotten giant of mid-20th-century directing.\u201d That judges him from the outside in.\n\nFrom the inside out, Glenville seemed serene. British Jesuits revere Robert Southwell, their martyred 16th-century \u201cprisoner-poet of comfort and strength.\u201d After Glenville fought with such \u201cstrength\u201d to advance his artistic vision, contain his personal struggles, and confront some of his era\u2019s greatest threats, how lucky he was, finally, to enjoy two decades of \u201ccomfort.\u201d\n\nFOR FURTHER READING\n\nCarol King, Glenville: The Elusive Director Who Charmed Hollywood and Triumphed on Broadway, 2012.\n\nThomas S.
