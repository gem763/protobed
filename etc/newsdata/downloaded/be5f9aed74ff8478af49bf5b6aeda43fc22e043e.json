Shakib was approached by the fixers during Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe Tri-Series in January 2018 and the 2018 IPL, Tri-Series in January 2018 and an IPL match between Sunrisers Hyderabad v Kings XI Punjab on 26 April 2018.\n\nIn a statement released by the world\u2019s governing body, the 32-years-old cricketer said: \u201cI am obviously extremely sad to have been banned from the game I love, but I completely accept my sanction for not reporting the approaches.
