Now as coach of the national team, he is on the brink of guiding the side to Euro 2020.\n\nThe former Dynamo Kiev and AC Milan star, nicknamed \u201cSheva\u201d, was appointed Ukraine coach in July 2016, his first managerial role.\n\nOn his watch, the team fell short of qualifying for the 2018 World Cup after a home loss to Croatia in the final round of games knocked them out of contention.\n\nBut ahead of next year\u2019s European Championship, Ukraine need just a point from their remaining two matches to reach the final stages of the tournament.\n\n\u201cI want to see this project through\u2026 to get to the Euros and perform well there,\u201d Shevchenko told AFP ahead of Monday\u2019s clash at home to defending champions Portugal.\n\nUkraine are unbeaten in qualifying with 16 points after six matches, the most recent a 2-0 win over Lithuania on Friday, and hold a surprise five-point lead in Group B.\n\nShevchenko appears to have struck a balance between young talent and experienced players such as West Ham forward Andriy Yarmolenko and Shakhtar Donetsk winger Yevgen Konoplyanka.\n\nShevchenko took over from Mykhaylo Fomenko, who resigned after Ukraine were knocked out of Euro 2016 without scoring a single goal.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Big challenge\u2019 \u2013\n\nCritics pointed to Shevchenko\u2019s lack of experience and argued that as Fomenko\u2019s assistant, he was partly responsible for Ukraine crashing out after losing all three games in their group.\n\n\u201cIt was a very big challenge for me. I agreed to do it with my eyes open,\u201d Shevchenko said of the managerial role.\n\n\u201cThe harder it is to succeed, the more it motivates me. I wanted to succeed with the national team and I believed in the players.\u201d\n\nUkraine did not qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia but many had urged a boycott over Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea and support for the separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe current qualifying campaign has allowed the team\u2019s younger talents to mature \u2014 with Ruslan Malinovskyi, who joined Atalanta from Belgian champions Genk this summer, and Manchester City\u2019s Oleksandr Zinchenko developing into key players.\n\nShevchenko and his Italian assistants, Mauro Tassotti and Andrea Maldera, have transformed the team\u2019s style into a more creative and attacking approach.\n\n\u201cI thought ball control and attacking football weren\u2019t for us because we didn\u2019t have enough technically skilled players,\u201d Artem Frankov, the editor-in-chief of \u201cFootball\u201d magazine, told AFP.\n\n\u201cBut suddenly a very curious side has appeared before us \u2013 a Ukraine team that is rejuvenated and quite combat-ready.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Prolific striker \u2013\n\nAt his peak as a player Shevchenko was renowned for his lightning counter attacks and clinical finishing. He was equally prolific with Dynamo Kiev and AC Milan as he was for Ukraine, for whom he scored 48 times in 111 matches.\n\nWith AC Milan he won the Champions League in 2003 after a penalty shoot-out victory over Juventus, and claimed a Serie A title in 2004, when he was awarded the Ballon d\u2019Or as European footballer of the year.\n\nShevchenko endured a difficult two-year spell at Chelsea, where he won the FA Cup and League Cup before returning to Dynamo Kiev, where he first shot to fame helping his side to five straight league titles from 1995.\n\nAfter ending his playing career following Euro 2012, Shevchenko tried to go into politics but failed to win a seat in Ukraine\u2019s parliament.", "description": "Kharkiv (Ukraine) (AFP) \u2013 Andriy Shevchenko enjoyed an illustrious career as Ukraine\u2019s greatest striker.
