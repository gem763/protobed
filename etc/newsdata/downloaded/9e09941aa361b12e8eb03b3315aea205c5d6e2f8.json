Getty\n\nLiverpool (vs Newcastle)\n\nWith Alisson still recovering from an injury he suffered in the opening game of the season, Adrian will continue in goal. Joel Matip has been preferred to Joe Gomez in recent weeks to partner Virgil van Dijk at the back, and the Cameroonian is likely to retain his place.\n\nThe biggest headache Jurgen Klopp has is whether to start Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in midfield ahead of Jordan Henderson or Gini Wijnaldum. It would be harsh to drop Wijnaldum, who scored in both of the Netherlands' wins over the international break.\n\nManchester United (vs Leicester)\n\nAfter United\u2019s unbelievable 4-0 opening day win over Chelsea, their season has been on a slight downward turn which could continue this weekend as their squad has been hit by injuries.\n\nPaul Pogba, Anthony Martial and Luke Shaw are all definitely out of the game, whilst Solskjaer has stated that Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Jesse Lingard are only \u201cmaybes\u201d. This injury crisis could open the door for Nemanja Matic to make his first start of the season, having only played 22 minutes thus far in United\u2019s last match against Southampton.\n\nChelsea (vs Wolves)\n\nChelsea have also made an indifferent start to the season, and they too are suffering with injuries. The Blues have been boosted by Callum Huson-Odoi and Reece James returning to training, but this game will come too soon for them. The same is true of Antonio Rudiger, though the German may make the matchday squad.\n\nMateo Kovacic and Emerson have picked up injuries in the last few weeks, and join Pedro and N\u2019Golo Kante in struggling for fitness ahead of the trip to Wolves.\n\nSpurs (vs Palace)\n\nMauricio Pochettino confirmed that Tanguy Ndombele, Ryan Sessengon and Kyle Walker-Peters will have their injuries assessed ahead of Saturday\u2019s game. If Ndombele is deemed unfit, it is likely Pochettino will switch from a diamond to a 4-2-3-1, with Lucas or Lamela featuring from the right.\n\nGiovani Lo Celso will not feature for a few weeks, after picking up an injury over the break on duty with Argentina but Dele Alli has continued his comeback over the last fortnight after not being included in the England squad.\n\nManchester City (vs Norwich)\n\nPep Guardiola has a big decision to make at right-back, with new signing Joao Cancelo not yet trusted with a Premier League start ahead of Kyle Walker. There are fewer options in the middle of the defence, with John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi the only recognised centre-backs.\n\nIlkay Gundogan picked up a knock with Germany so David Silva should continue in midfield, and it is still unclear whether Guardiola prefers Fernandinho or new signing Rodri in the holding role.\n\nArsenal (vs Watford)\n\nThe Gunners are yet another club with injuries aplenty, with Joe Willock, Granit Xhaka and Lucas Torreira all facing a race to be fit for the trip to Vicarage Road. Kieran Tierney and Hector Bellerin have been spotted in training, but it will be a few weeks before we see them in first-team action.\n\nNicolas Pepe sat out of the Ivory Coast squad to work closely with the Arsenal coaches as he continues to acclimatise to the Premier League. Pepe is expected to once again link up with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alex Lacazette in Arsenal\u2019s new-look front line.", "description": "Premier League football makes its eagerly anticipated return this weekend after a two-week hiatus during the international break.
