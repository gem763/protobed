He likes cybersecurity stocks PANW, SPLK.\n\nPg M3, Trader: A mixed week with DJIA and SP500 down but Nasdaq Comp up. But the week was volatile. The ISM manufacturing and nonmanufacturing indexes were below expectations and indicated slowdown. Markets rebounded when the probability of October Fed rate cut rose and the unemployment rate fell to 50-yr low and that meant no recession in the near future [see Sahm Rule in Market Insights ]. NY Fed Model has 38% probability for recession in the next 12 months. So, prepare the portfolios for slowdown, not recession.\n\nThe Fed alone cannot prevent recession with monetary policy. It will need assist from fiscal policy. After poor ISM manufacturing data [under 50; contraction], the probability of October Fed rate cut rose significantly. The money-market repo market had been stressed from cash shortages but it seems to have stabilized from Fed actions. The Fed has already flipped from being hawk to dove. Much of 2017 tax reform [fiscal stimulus] has already played out or countered by tariffs. Odds for bipartisan deals [on infrastructure, etc] are slim, so a US-China trade deal may be the only hope.\n\nFacebook [FB] cryptocurrency Libra has run into regulatory headwinds from the Fed, Treasury and several European countries. Founding members of Libra Association have only signed letters of intent and contributed $10 million each without any further obligations/commitments. Now some founding members have withdrawn [PYPL] or are considering doing so [MA, V]. It seems that FB has to fight regulatory battles on its own and the matters won\u2019t resolve anytime soon for Libra .\n\n[The CME FedWatch tool, based on current fed fund futures quotes, shows the following probabilities for 2019:\n\nFor 3rd hike [cut],\n\n0% for hike [76.4% for cut] at FOMC 10/30/19;\n\n0% for hike [89.3% for cut] at FOMC 12/11/19;\n\nhttp://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html ]\n\nFor the week [index changes only], DJIA -0.92%, SP500 -0.33%, Nasdaq Comp +0.54%, Russell 2000 -1.30%. DJ Transports -3.01%; DJ Utilities +0.48%. US$ -0.29%, oil/WTI -5.54%, gold +0.47%.\n\nYTD [index changes only], DJIA +13.92%, SP500 +17.76%, Nasdaq Comp +20.30%.\n\nPg M6, Europe: Italian fitness-equipment company Technogym [TGYM.it; P/EBITDA 22.1] is profitable [unlike the recent US IPO PTON]. Almost 86% of sales are to businesses [sports clubs, hotels, cruise lines]. It is launching Technogym Live to stream live or recorded exercise classes. It buys back old equipment and resells it.\n\nPg M6, Emerging Markets: Chinese growth has been 3x the US growth for many years. But Chinese stocks have lagged badly. The US-China trade tensions are only a recent factor. Structural issues can explain this lag \u2013 in the unique Chinese mixture of communism and capitalism, shareholders take backseat. With limited access to capital from state banks, many companies issue dilutive equity. Only a few best-in-class stocks have done well [BABA, PNGAY, etc]. Consumer stocks have attractive valuations.\n\nPg M10, Commodities: Palladium is at a new high and the rally may continue [early-2018- ]. High demand [from gasoline-engine catalytic converters] and restricted supply [from Russia, South Africa] are driving the rally. Risk is global slowdown and a possible downturn in the auto industry. Platinum [used more for diesel-engine catalytic converters] is lagging badly; although it can also be used for gasoline-engine catalytic converters, the conversion is costly and time consuming; it seems to have value but its supply [high]-demand [low] drivers are not in place. Diesel sales have been hurt by emission scandals and tougher emission standards.\n\nPg M7, Options: To bet against much hyped marijuana stocks, buy puts on ETF MJ [it owns ACB, CGC, GWPH, CRON, TLRY, all down sharply and have further to fall].\n\n[SP500 VIX 17.04, SKEW 114.54] [10-Yr TYVIX 5.18] [Yahoo Finance data]\n\nPg M29, L62: An ugly week in Europe [Norway -1.58%, UK -3.52%, Greece -5.34%] and a bad week in Asia [Taiwan +0.70%, India -3.10%]. The equity CEF index [data to Thursday] outperformed the DJIA and its discount was -4.5%.\n\nTreasury rates 3-mo yield 1.71%, 2-yr 1.40%, 5-yr 1.34%, 10-yr 1.52%, 30-yr 2.01% [Treasury data*]. Dollar fell, DXY 98.84, -0.3% [M31]. Gold rose to $1,499, +0.6%; the gold-miners were flat [M34]. [^XAU was at 91.11, UNCH for the week]\n\n*Treasury Yield-Curve https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=y...\n\nTop FDIC insured savings deposit rates*: Money-market accounts 2.23%; 1-yr CDs 2.28%; 5-yr CDs 2.76% [L63].\n\n*For local rates https://www.depositaccounts.com/banks/rates-map/\n\nPg 18: Cover Story, \u201cWho Will Win the New Broker Wars?\u201d Several major brokers [SCHW, ETFC, IBKR, AMTD, etc] dropped equity trading commissions to zero \u2013 Fidelity and Vanguard were the holdouts for now. These are tough times for brokers. We may be at the tail end of this long bull market and low rates adversely affect margins on cash. Competition is intense. Industry may consolidate and there may be job cuts. Lite/retail-trading systems will be commission-free [but the brokers get compensated by payments for order flows] and pro/institutional-trading systems [with better executions] will have commissions.\n\nThe winner may be SCHW, a disruptor. It also has diverse business lines. More than 50% of its revenue is from net interest income. It has $3.7 trillion in client AUM and that includes $1.55 trillion via RIAs, the largest in industry. It is #2 in robo-advising. Schwab Bank [2003- ] has $276 billion in assets and it is now bigger than KEY, FITB, etc; it will be subjected to stiffer stress-tests the next time. Schwab funds its Bank via cash from brokerages and robo-advisors.\n\nPg 24: Commission-free equity trading has arrived, but look at the fine print or catches. There will likely be commissions for options, fixed-income, OTC/pink-sheet stocks, foreign stocks, etc. Commissions may also apply to assisted trading, institutional trading, etc. Fees may apply to wire transfers. Brokers may make up for lost revenue by paying little on brokerage cash [only a few now offer money-market funds as core/settlement accounts (Fidelity, Vanguard)], spread on margin loans, payments for order flows, etc.\n\nPg 8, Up & Down Wall Street: Unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, a 50-yr low, and it counteracted weak ISM manufacturing [below 50; contraction] and nonmanufacturing [above 50; expansion] indexes. Indications are for slowdown, not recession. An October Fed rate cut is quite likely. 2-yr T-Note at 1.4% shows where the fed funds are headed and that means more cuts ahead. The Fed will try to keep this expansion going as long as it can.\n\nWall Street optimism seems to be inversely proportional to the prospects of presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. In polls for Democratic nomination, Warren and Biden are tied but in real-time betting markets, Warren leads Biden 50% vs 25%. Sanders\u2019 heart issues hurt his chances and Warren was the huge beneficiary leading to the big market selloff on Wednesday. David Rosenberg [ Gluskin Sheff ] now includes in the top of his worry list Warren presidency and the Senate flipping over to Democrats. The impeachment inquiry for President Trump may negatively affect his reelection chances and also reduce the prospects of legislative progress on President\u2019s agenda. Stephanie Pomboy [ MacroMavens ] worries that corporate taxes may go up as some expiring tax cuts may not be renewed by the Congress.\n\nPg 11, Streetwise: Q3 earnings won\u2019t be pretty with -4.1% y-o-y expected. But actual earnings may beat low expectations and could be flat. High-drama earnings will be from NFLX, MAT, HAS, T, GPS, GOOGL.\n\nMore later\u2026.\n\nYBB", "description": "[ Italics-bold within the brackets are my additions/elaborations ] [ New M* Discussions doesn\u2019t allow any colors for cut-and-paste from WORD ] MW - 25496", "authors": ["Contributor", "Explorer"], "top_image": "https://zwcdr85544.i.lithium.com/html/assets/favicon.ico?15D4DC4041FDD3CD56F6121736C9C68D", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
