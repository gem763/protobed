The bank may need to reset its culture, too, \u201cwhich we believe best emanates from the top of the organization, starting with the CEO.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t help but think that Wells Fargo struggled to attract top talent for this position, and perhaps a compromise on the location of the CEO post was necessary in order to recruit Mr. Scharf,\u201d Horowitz said.\n\nOn an earlier conference call, Scharf said he doesn\u2019t foresee issues running the bank from New York City. KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl agreed, writing in a note that being in New York shouldn\u2019t be a \u201churdle\u201d for the CEO, as other banks have similar situations. In any case, removing the overhang of lacking a permanent CEO is a \u201cnet positive\u201d for Wells Fargo, according to Kleinhanzl.\n\nCiti\u2019s Horowitz added that there are \u201csome open questions\u201d about Scharf\u2019s recent track record for investors. \u201cIt\u2019s never been entirely clear to us why he left Visa,\u201d Horowitz said. Though Scharf made the \u201cright longer-term strategic decisions\u201d for BNY Mellon, he didn\u2019t stay to see them through, and there may be \u201cquestions on why he would leave so early in his tenure.\u201d\n\nHorowitz kept his rating on Wells Fargo neutral amid uncertainty about whether Scharf can \u201cmeaningfully accelerate\u201d improvements at the bank.\n\nWells Fargo shares jumped as much as 5.2% in early Friday trading, to the highest since March 20. BNY Mellon\u2019s stock sank as much as 5.5%, the most since April 17.\n\nWhile New York beat San Francisco for Scharf, it\u2019s recently been losing out to the West Coast when it comes to IPOs.
