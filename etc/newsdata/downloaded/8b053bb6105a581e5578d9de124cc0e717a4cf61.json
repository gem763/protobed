Still, there is something queasy about mining such fresh real-life trauma for popcorn entertainment. At times, it feels like Mission: Impossible, with its glamorous, five-star hotel setting and a ticking timebomb set piece involving a crying baby. Mostly though, it\u2019s quite unpleasant, watching bodies torn apart by grenades and machine guns.\n\nAn ensemble piece that moves between the terrorists and the victims, in the film\u2019s more interesting moments, it affords the terrorists (played by Amandeep Singh and Kapil Kumar Netra) small flashes of humour. Rather than cartoon villains, they are witless, brainwashed teenagers who marvel at the posh hotel\u2019s high-end toilets. Weirdly, its straight-backed heroes (played by Dev Patel and Armie Hammer) are drawn with less nuance.", "description": "Based on the 2008 attacks in the Indian city, this ensemble piece feels a little too Mission: Impossible", "authors": ["Simran Hans"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e3ef3d27390e645d4e08c32823e4254bdf294dc/0_42_2036_1221/master/2036.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a24071483739128120d6f2bc60ba0c7f", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
