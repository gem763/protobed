Instead, regulators said policies and procedures are in place to identify and avoid or address material conflicts of interest that could be created by an adviser having full control or authority over the financial affairs of a client.\n\nTwo of the investment industry\u2019s self-regulatory agencies were active participants in the review of the client-adviser relationship, and the CSA said both would be amending their member rules, policies, and guidance to be consistent with the changes.\n\nOne of those agencies, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada, issued a statement Thursday saying it is working to ensure a uniform approach.\n\n\u201cAs a pan-Canadian public-interest regulator, IIROC believes that the proper management of conflicts of interest is critical to improving public confidence in our capital markets and financial system \u2014 and to overall investor protection,\u201d the self-regulatory agency said in the statement.\n\nIIROC said the reforms will set out fundamental obligations for advisers, which will form \u201can essential pillar\u201d of the regulatory framework that protects Canadian investors.", "description": "Canadian regulators stopped short of imposing a fiduciary or \u2018best interest\u2019 standard on all investment advisers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/investing_foto.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
