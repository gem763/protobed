Though fragile I'm not going to be angry or bitter.\n\n'I'm getting in touch with my MP Liz Saville Roberts for some advice.\n\n'I don't want to be re-housed, just to regain the home I've enjoyed for the last four years with my three lovely cats.\n\nA police van was today pictured outside of the property. Miss Ralphs said she didn't want to be re-housed\n\n'I'm 70, a retired professional and I'd like some respect for my dignity and sanity. I had a sleepless night hoping for a last minute change of mind.'\n\nBefore being evicted she declared: 'I feel like a donkey dragged 400 miles through the Sahara then being kicked and punched instead of being able to reach the oasis for water. I'm so happy here with my cats and their feline friends. My neighbours are animal lovers, too.\n\n'I'm a quiet and submissive spinster just getting over a run of bad luck. I don't smoke, drink or take drugs - but the system has walked out on me. No one is helping me.'\n\nOne bystander said : 'It's all very sad.' The MP said : 'I will do everything I can to help her. No one wants to see a 70-year-old in the street. What she needs is some intensive support and to be able to keep her possessions.'\n\nMiss Ralphs is pictured above with all of the items in her home.
