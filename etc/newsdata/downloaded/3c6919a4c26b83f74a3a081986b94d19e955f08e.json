(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to fellow House Democrats Monday afternoon outlining a plan to formalize the impeachment inquiry into President Trump with a vote on Thursday, marking the first move towards a public impeachment.\n\n\u201cThis resolution establishes the procedure for hearings that are open to the American people, authorizes the disclosure of deposition transcripts, outlines procedures to transfer evidence to the Judiciary Committee as it considers potential articles of impeachment, and sets forth due process rights for the President and his Counsel,\u201d Pelosi\u2019s letter reads.\n\nThe Speaker also took aim at President Trump and Republican allies\u2019 repeated claims that the House\u2019s inquiry \u201clacks the necessary authorization for a valid impeachment proceeding\u201d by not taking an official vote.\n\n\u201cWe are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump Administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives. Nobody is above the law,\u201d the letter concludes.\n\nHouse Rules Committee Chairman James P. McGovern (D., Mass.) will introduce the resolution on the House floor tomorrow to \u201censure transparency and provide a clear path forward,\u201d according to a statement from the representative.\n\n\u201cThis is a solemn time for our country. With our existing authority under the Constitution and the rules of the House, Congress has been investigation serious allegations involving President Trump and Ukraine . . . This is the right thing to do for the institution and the American people,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nThe official text of the resolution has not yet been released. It\u2019s unclear what prompted the Democrats to move forward, as federal district Judge Beryl Howell ruled last week that the House\u2019s current impeachment inquiry is legal, a fact Pelosi\u2019s letter mentions.\n\nLast week, President Trump drew heavy criticism for calling the inquiry a \u201clynching,\u201d a description defended by Senator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.).\n\n\u201cThis is a lynching in every sense. This is un-American,\u201d Graham said on October 22. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a situation in my lifetime as a lawyer where somebody is accused of a major misconduct who cannot confront the accuser, call witnesses on her behalf and have the discussion in the light of day so the public can judge.\u201d", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to fellow House Democrats Monday afternoon outlining a plan to formalize the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Andrew C.
