(Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nColumnist\n\nThe verdict of history is that the trade war that\u2019s raging between the United States and China will lead to no good \u2014 with consequences that could go well beyond trade and threaten the world\u2019s geopolitical and economic stability.\n\nHow this plays out is anyone\u2019s guess, but we should not pretend that there is no danger in letting the conflict fester. Possible fallouts range from a gradual disintegration of the existing global trading system, to the formation of trading and economic blocs, and, at worst, to war itself.\n\nThe historical parallels are mostly sobering. During the 1990s, the widespread assumption among economists and business leaders was that \u201cglobalization\u201d was permanent and mostly beneficial. Global flows of goods, services, money (a.k.a. \u201ccapital\u201d), ideas and technology boosted living standards.\n\nThe process was widely seen as irreversible, \u201ca one-way road to the future,\u201d as Princeton University historian Harold James has put it. But it wasn\u2019t, as James argued in his astonishingly prescient book \u201cThe End of Globalization: Lessons From the Great Depression,\u201d published in 2001, at the height of the globalization infatuation.\n\nWith hindsight, it\u2019s easy to see why so many observers (including this reporter) bought uncritically into the globalization story. Much of it was and is true. In the last half of the 19th century, new technologies \u2014 the telegraph, steamships, railroads \u2014 brought countries closer together, just as newer technologies \u2014 containerization, jet aircraft, fiber optics and the Internet \u2014 have today.\n\nThe result was mass movements of people, goods and capital across borders. The first trans-Atlantic cable was laid in 1866. Between 1871 and 1915, an estimated 36 million people left Europe, most headed for the New World, leaving countries with too many workers and entering nations with too few. Though messy and often cruel, this shift ultimately paid huge dividends in improved living \u00adstandards.\n\nBritain, the leading economic power of the day, maintained order through its embrace of the gold standard (which stabilized prices) and free trade (which expanded markets). \u201cThe great streams of capital, trade, and migration were linked,\u201d wrote James. \u201cWithout the capital flows, it would have been impossible to construct the infrastructure \u2014 the railways, the cities \u2014 for the new \u00admigrants.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlobalism fails because humans and the institutions they create cannot adequately handle the psychological and institutional consequences of the interconnected world,\u201d James wrote.\n\nThe collapse of pre-World War II globalization was hastened by the Great Depression, but in James\u2019s telling, it might have buckled under political pressures in any case. There was a clamor for more protectionism, more immigration restrictions and more curbs on global capital flows. Sound familiar? In 1931, Britain abandoned the gold standard; in 1932, it ditched free trade by creating preferential tariffs for Commonwealth countries at a conference in Ottawa.\n\nFlash forward. In the first decades after World War II, the United States successfully urged its allies to liberalize trade, but support for this approach has waned.\n\nBy accident or design, the contentious trade negotiations between the United States and China will reframe the international economic system in the context of a new century with different political and economic conditions.\n\nAccording to a report by Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, the tariffs imposed by President Trump on Chinese imports into the United States have raised the average tariff to 24 percent from 3 percent at the start of the trade war and \u201cwill affect nearly everything Americans purchase from China.\u201d\n\nAlthough China has retaliated against Trump\u2019s tariffs, the effect on U.S. exports may be less for two reasons, notes Bown\u2019s report: First, China has exempted 31 percent of U.S. exports from increased tariffs, including aircraft, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors; and second, China\u2019s tariffs seem lower than the United States\u2019. (A conspicuous exception involves U.S. autos, where the average tariff is scheduled to go to 42.6 percent. Likewise, U.S. soybean exports are hit hard.)\n\nIt\u2019s a good guess that the new global economic system will give overt political considerations greater weight than its predecessor. Countries \u2014 including, obviously, the United States and China \u2014 will link trade benefits and penalties to their political agendas. This is a perilous path, as no doubt both Americans and Chinese have realized in recent months.\n\nThere is a powerful tension between politics and economics. Countries and their voters want to reclaim their economic sovereignty \u2014 that is, the ability to influence their economies \u2014 when technologies and markets have increasingly transferred those powers to transnational forums that defy easy manipulation. (This conflict is especially evident in Britain\u2019s Brexit debate over leaving the European Union.)\n\nPut in the simplest terms: Both China and the United States want to be king of the hill, instead of learning how to share.\n\nRead more from Robert Samuelson\u2019s archive.", "description": "The U.S.-China trade war will have major consequences.", "authors": ["Robert J.
