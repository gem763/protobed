If that, too, is scored even the countback on the cards will continue through the 11th round, and so on.\n\nThat would not affect the world championship result. The initial draw would leave Taylor and Prograis retaining their belts, while The Ring magazine title would remain vacant.\n\nBut the 2019 Super Series regulation, applied because of the impossibility of an equally gruelling rematch before the end of the year, provides a huge incentive for both men to keep fighting flat out to the finish.\n\nGood news for the packed 02 crowd and the television viewers on Sky Sports Box Office, albeit a demanding prospect for two world class fighters if either or both believe they are ahead in the judging.\n\nBattle between Taylor and Prograis is also the final of the World Boxing Super Series\n\nEdinburgh's Tartan Tornado and the New Orleans native nicknamed Rougarou are each considered the best light-welter in the world by different ranking organisations. That they are the two best is beyond rational dispute.\n\nThe bookies are having a hard time splitting them. Paddy Power make Prograis the 8-13 on favourite, Taylor an 11-5 shot.\n\nMost significantly in view of the particular piece of history they could find themselves making the odds on a draw are 20-l, significantly shorter than the 33-1 which is the average for most world title fights.\n\nBoth their unbeaten records feature high knock-out ratios, Prograis at 83.3 per cent with 20 stoppages in 24 fights, Taylor on 80 % from 13 KOs in 15 wins.\n\nMost of the boxing fraternity see it as 50-50, while their own respective predictions ooze confidence.\n\nTaylor says: 'I will knock him out to prove I'm the best in the world in this division.'\n\nPrograis responded: 'He can't beat me. This will be the victory which makes me world famous.'\n\n* In the early 1900s an attempt to resolve draws was made by boxing correspondents at ringside reaching concensus on a winner and collectively printing their 'Newspaper Decision.' A majority of the public recognised that verdict but the official result remained a draw in the records of the National Sporting Club in London, the principal governing body at the time.\n\nBoxing historians can wallow three centuries deep into the origins of the hardest game with a book recording the life and ancient times of the original Jewish hero of the bare-knuckle ring.\n\nDaniel Mendoza was champion of England from 1792 to 1795. As such he improved the perception, self-pride and standards of life for many Jewish people in this country.\n\nAs an accomplished writer, his own memoirs were perhaps the first sports auto-biography ever penned. Wynn Wheldon's exhaustive research has produced only the second book about this remarkable character, one set in the sepia England of his age. It is a fascinating boxing curiosity.\n\n*The Fighting Jew (The Life and Times of Daniel Mendoza), by Wynn Wheldon, Amberley Publishing, \u00a320", "description": "For the first time in the history of professional boxing there will be a winner of a drawn fight if Josh Taylor and Regis Prograis are level on the judges' cards on Saturday night.", "authors": ["Jeff Powell For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/01/20013474-0-image-a-22_1571702624623.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
