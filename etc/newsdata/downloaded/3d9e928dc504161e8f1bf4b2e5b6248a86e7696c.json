Other House Democrats have said they expect the matter will now figure into their investigation of a possible impeachment.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But the military bookings at Turnberry are the latest in a series of episodes in which the president\u2019s private businesses have intersected with his public position in ways that he can profit from.\n\nThe pattern also raises questions about how military officials failed to anticipate the questions that would accompany a large number of US military personnel marching into the opulent halls of one of the president\u2019s golf resorts at public expense.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s defenders note that US military jets have been stopping in the region long before his election. A decision by the Pentagon to have its flights stop more frequently at the local airport was made under the Obama administration.\n\nThe military said the vast majority of US military personnel who have passed through since 2016 have stayed at other area hotels, not Mr Trump\u2019s. On Thursday, the Air Force said in a statement that it had found 659 instances when its flight crews stayed overnight in the area in the past four years.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Trump Turnberry was closed for renovations from 2015 until mid-2016.\n\nThose who did stay there paid a discounted rate of as little as $130 (\u00a3105) a night, compared with a typical price of about $380 (\u00a3306) a night.\n\n\u201cTo me, it was honestly just a hotel, a place to sleep,\u201d said Nathan Wendzel, 33, a helicopter pilot, who spent a night at the Trump Turnberry last September, along with about 35 other members of his Iowa National Guard unit, on their way back to the United States from a trip to Kosovo. \u201cIt is better than a tent with no air conditioning.\u201d\n\nNeither Trump\u2019s company nor the US military has disclosed how much government money has been spent at the Trump resort. But a dozen Trump Turnberry staff members, all speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said the military stays have been a regular occurrence and, often, encompass surprisingly large groups.\n\nBuses like the one that arrived in July periodically turn up at midnight or 2am carrying dozens of soldiers or Marines, several hotel staff members said. Less expensive hotels, like a TraveLodge and a Premier Inn, are next to the airport \u2014 the Trump Turnberry resort is about a 40-minute drive.\n\nThe bookings for US military personnel staying at the Trump resort are made by employees of the Glasgow Prestwick Airport, which has an incentive to curry favour with Mr Trump. The airport has become economically reliant on the military-refuelling flights, creating at least the appearance of a motive to steer business to the US commander in chief.\n\nMichael Matheson, Scottish transport minister, told the Scottish Parliament this week that the Turnberry is one of 13 hotels the airport uses and that \u201cTurnberry is generally booked only if other hotels are unavailable or if customers specifically request it.\u201d\n\nBut critics said that the military stays at Trump Turnberry still underscore recurring questions that have grown out of Trump\u2019s singular decision to remain the owner of the business that bears his name while holding high office.\n\nLong stays by lobbyists and foreign officials at the Trump International hotel in Washington, Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s recent stay at a Trump resort in Ireland, and the president\u2019s highly publicized outings to his own golf clubs have all raised similar issues.\n\nAt times Mr Trump has appeared to promote his hotels at the same moment that he denies steering them government money.\n\n\u201cNOTHING TO DO WITH ME,\u201d Mr Trump tweeted this week in all capital letters about the military stays at his Turnberry resort, before adding in parenthesis, \u201cThey have good taste!\u201d\n\nEven some guests at Turnberry questioned the arrangement. \u201cIt is completely inappropriate,\u201d said Bennett Rodick, a Chicago lawyer watching the sunset from the hotel lobby with his wife. \u201cYou don\u2019t want him commingling his business interests with his government interests.\u201d\n\nThe US military has been using Prestwick as a stopover since at least World War II, in part because of the extremely long runway the airport offers, and its reputation for being largely free of fog.\n\nGeneral Dwight Eisenhower sometimes landed there, and after the war Scotland gave him permanent use of an apartment in a medieval castle not far from Turnberry that he frequently visited. In March 1960, Elvis Presley, then wrapping up his military service, stopped at the airport for a few hours and was mobbed by his fans.\n\nBut the last decade brought trying times to the airport. The US military\u2019s stopovers declined with the end of the war in Iraq and the pullback of troops from Afghanistan. And commercial air traffic shifted to the larger Glasgow International Airport. The situation got so desperate that in 2013 the Prestwick airport, deep in debt, was sold to the Scottish government for around $1.\n\nMr Trump entered the picture the next year, when he bought the Turnberry hotel and its storied golf course \u2014 it was one of the courses that had hosted the British Open \u2014 from a company owned by the emirate of Dubai, reportedly for about $55 million (\u00a344.3m). Soon after he flew with great fanfare into Prestwick airport on his Boeing 757.\n\nHe announced that his resort was forming a cross-promotion deal with the airport. To make Turnberry \u201cthe finest resort anywhere,\u201d he told reporters in 2014, \u201cwe need an airport.\u201d\n\nThere would be \u201cpeople coming in from New York, high-level people from all over the place \u2014 a lot of private aircraft will be landing with groups and individuals and we expect to be using Prestwick quite a bit,\u201d Mr Trump promised.\n\nTrump executives also began negotiating with Prestwick airport officials to try to ensure that they would refer visiting aircrews to the hotel, emails first obtained by The Guardian in 2017 show. Details of the House Oversight Committee investigation into the military stays at the resort were reported last week by Politico.\n\nBut at least for Prestwick, almost none of Mr Trump\u2019s predictions came true. The majority of the resort\u2019s customers are affluent North Americans, along with a smaller number of Asians and others who come on package golf tours. Few arrive via Prestwick.\n\nThese days its cavernous main passenger terminal is often almost deserted. The only airline that still flies into Prestwick is the discount carrier Ryanair. Only a handful of its flights come in each day, mainly from relatively small European markets. No flights arrive from London, Dublin or North America.\n\n\u201cYears ago we had more flights and other airlines, but it is very quiet now,\u201d said Margaret Vincent, 57, pulling down the gates Thursday afternoon to close the empty airport bookstore next to the empty cafe, empty bar and empty foreign currency exchange desk.\n\nBut on the opposite side of the airport, the US military has brought back at least some of the business.\n\nThe Defence Logistics Agency signed a formal refuelling and aviation services contract with Prestwick in August 2016, under President Barack Obama. The contract began being used in a major way the following year, after Mr Trump took office. Through June, federal contracting records show, it has made at least 925 fuel purchases at the airport, worth $17.3 million.\n\nA US military aircraft \u2014 often a C-130 Hercules transport plane \u2014 lands or takes off almost every day, according to local air plane enthusiasts who wait by the airfield to watch them.\n\nIn part because of the refuelling agreement, the level of US military air traffic has surged during the Trump presidency. After 145 stopovers in 2016, there were 257 last year and 259 in the first eight months of this year, the Pentagon said.\n\nThe number of stopovers with overnight stays, entailing booking rooms at hotels, has climbed from 75 in 2016 to 208 last year and 220 this year through August, according to Defence Department figures.\n\nTrump Turnberry can seem like incongruous housing for military personnel. The white walls and red roof of the main hotel stretch along a high ridge overlooking the rocky coast of the Irish Sea.\n\nThe windows look out over stone steps descending through rolling hills to the golf course, with the historic Turnberry castle and lighthouse in one direction and the surreal dome of the granite Ailsa Craig protruding from the sea in the other. Each night at sunset, a bagpiper \u2014 also in a kilt \u2014 parades past the lobby windows, right in front of the helicopter pad.\n\nSeveral of the military visitors complained that the resort was not a particularly convenient place. It is far from any restaurants or even a pub. A burger costs almost $26 (\u00a321) at current exchange rates, and blended whisky starts at nearly $10 a glass (\u00a38). A day ticket for hotel guests to play on the signature golf course costs $495 (\u00a3400).\n\nMr Trump visited during the 2016 presidential campaign and his staff passed out baseball hats with the slogan \u201cMake Turnberry Great Again.\u201d Since his election, Mr Trump and his family have also brought additional federal spending to the resort. He stayed at the hotel and played a round of golf there in July 2018, accompanied by diplomats, advisers and his Secret Service detail.\n\n\u201cI have arrived in Scotland and will be at Trump Turnberry for two days of meetings, calls and hopefully, some golf \u2014 my primary form of exercise!\u201d Mr Trump wrote on Twitter during that visit. \u201cThe weather is beautiful, and this place is incredible!\u201d\n\nEric Trump, who helps oversee its operations, visits frequently, along with his own Secret Service detail. Asked Thursday about the stays by military personnel, Eric Trump declined to comment but praised his family\u2019s property.\n\nRecords show payments of at least $64,000 (\u00a351,500) to Trump Turnberry by the State Department in the last two years, although part of that money might have been refunded, the records suggest, after the trips ended. The Trump Organisation said it refunds to the government any payments made to Turnberry for those visits by federal government employees after accounting for the resort\u2019s costs, but declined to provide details.\n\nMr Trump, after he was elected, transferred ownership of his resorts, golf courses and other properties to a trust that is controlled by his sons and company executives. But he still benefits financially.\n\nThe resort lost $4.2 million (\u00a33.38m) in 2017, according to an annual filing in Britain, continuing a string of losses reported since Trump bought it.\n\nThe club had revenue of $23.4 million (\u00a318.9m) in 2018, according to a financial report filed in the United States, its best year since the Trumps\u2019 ownership. The company has not filed the resort\u2019s profit or loss statement for 2018.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The middle-aged golfers had finished their last single-malt whiskies late one night this July, and the bartenders were closing up.
