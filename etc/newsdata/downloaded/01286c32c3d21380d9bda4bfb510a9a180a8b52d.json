This is the first time we can say that the chances of being a long-term survivor of advanced melanoma are now over 50 per cent, which is a huge milestone.\"\n\nPatients in the trial were divided into three groups and given either both nivolumab and ipilimumab or one of the drugs with a placebo.\n\nThe five-year overall survival rate for the combination group was 52 per cent, with 74 per cent of those patients going treatment-free after five years.\n\nThe overall survival for the nivolumab group was 44 per cent, while for the ipilimumab group, it was 26 per cent.\n\nMr Larkin, who is also a professor at the Institute of Cancer Research, added: \"By giving these drugs together you are effectively taking two brakes off the immune system rather than one so that the immune system is able to recognise tumours it wasn't previously recognising and react to that and destroy them.\"\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

For others, the decision may be to give the drugs in sequence.\u201d\n\nThe findings from the trial, which was led by the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, will be presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Barcelona, Spain, and published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe treatment is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and is available in this combined way on the NHS, following assessments by doctors.\n\nAgencies contributed to this report", "description": "A combination of two powerful drugs for skin cancer can increase a patient\u2019s long-term survival chances by 50 per cent, according to a study.
