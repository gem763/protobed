In the community room, the carpet doesn\u2019t completely cover the floor, revealing dirty and rotten wooden boards underneath.\n\n(Image: BristolLive/ WS)\n\n(Image: BristolLive/ WS)\n\nIn the toilet and kitchen area wires are exposed and not boxed in, and optimistically, someone has long ago written \u2018Blocked here\u2019 with an arrow pointing at a dirty, decaying and ageing pipe.\n\nThe corners of the windows are bug-ridden and paint-peeled, holes patched up by faded sticky tape.\n\nBut in the ceiling, one tenant points to the worst issue. A scar emerges from the end of the window and widens as it moves across the top of the room, the ceiling plaster long gone, exposing the rotten wood above.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe at all,\u201d said Glenis Chard.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t go in there really. When it rains, the water pours through, and there\u2019s electrics in that ceiling, there\u2019s wires - it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d she added.\n\n(Image: BristolLive/ WS)\n\n(Image: BristolLive/ WS)\n\n\"The carpet is threadbare, falling to pieces. You've got a lot of people living in here who don't walk so well and it's just a shocking trip hazard, for starters.\"\n\nMrs Chard said that more than a year ago, the two wardens that manage Walwyn Gardens told residents that things were going to be sorted, and that Bristol City Council had agreed it was time for a refurbishment, a major repair job.\n\n\u201cThey told us it would be sorted,\u201d said Mrs Chard.\n\n\u201cIn February this year, all these surveyors came around with cameras, measuring up, taking pictures of what needed doing. We were all hopeful,\u201d she explained.\n\n(Image: BristolLive/ WS)\n\n\u201cAnd then, nothing. We were told the plans were in place, but then that it was on hold. It\u2019s got worse in that time,\u201d she added.\n\nParts of this area in Bristol were recently named as statistically one of the most deprived places in Britain.\n\nThe plight of the residents of Walwyn Gardens comes as a Bristol Live investigation revealed people in Hartcliffe who said they feel forgotten and left behind, both nationally and by the rest of the city.\n\n(Image: BristolLive/ WS)\n\n(Image: BristolLive/ WS)\n\n(Image: BristolLive/ WS)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right that we should be paying our full rent to live in this building, when we can\u2019t use the facilities - if it carries on any longer, we\u2019ll all start thinking about withholding some of our rent, seeing as though where we live is in this state,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis is diabolical,\u201d she said.\n\nBristol City Council is yet to provide an explanation about the state of Walwyn Gardens.", "description": "Pensioners in Bristol have experienced holes in the ceiling, mouldy window frames, and threadbare carpet tiles", "authors": ["Tristan Cork", "Image", "Bristollive", "Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20582460.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Inside-the-diabolical-Bristol-sheltered-housing-unit-where-residents-say-theyve-had-enoughIts.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
