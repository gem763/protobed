Nuzzi puts it best perhaps in this paragraph\n\nQuote \"for many of these staffers the campaign feels like it should be a coronation. Joe Biden 2020 isn't a labor of love or ideology. it\u2019s about the proper order of things. it\u2019s about who's entitled to what. it\u2019s the vehicle by which the democratic party establishment arrives once more to power, the displaced Obama and Clinton professionals reinstalled to the levers of power.\"\n\nThis perhaps more than anything else I\u2019ve ever seen boils down the Biden campaign to its essence. Biden is simply the vehicle thrust upon all us in order for the army of K street lobbyists and consultants to restore the cash cow that was the presidency under Barack Obama Barack Hussein Obama2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike Rice: Al-Baghdadi death 'doesn't mean we can declare mission accomplished and just walk away' Cummings' staff honor him in op-ed: He brought 'moral clarity' MORE. A Biden campaign restores the natural order of things in which oceans of outside money groups coalesce around the white house, advisory councils, and trade meetings. He resets the clock on a multi-billion-dollar machine that has been disruptive.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what America rejected in 2016 and there is very little evidence that anybody outside of Washington wants it. Biden's campaign numbers show one on complete life support if current trends continue. as I discussed on Friday, a POLITICO report from Thursday tells us that less than one third of Biden's donations are from small dollar donations less than 200 dollars. the lowest number in the entire race.\n\nThat means Biden is wholly dependent on big dollar donors to keep his campaign afloat, and guess what? Even they are starting to realize that it\u2019s probably not going to work out. The New York times reports that Biden\u2019s finance director sent an email to bundlers proclaiming, \"We need you to dig deep\" while trying to ensure them that they had enough money in order to keep the entire enterprise afloat.\n\nThe times also noted that wall street donors feeding Pete Buttigieg Peter (Pete) Paul ButtigiegBiden: 'I know I'm the frontrunner' in 2020 race 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike 2020 Democrats commend US forces on ISIS leader's death MORE at one of his latest big dollar fundraisers felt that quote: that Biden already lost. that is a very bad place to be. ultimately what the former vp is doing is trying to convince us all that all the real metrics that matter for campaigns don't matter simply because he is already generally well known.\n\nDon't forget people, the very own president that he served under won't endorse him but has no problem endorsing Justin Trudeau Justin Pierre James TrudeauThe Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Trump's impeachment plea to Republicans Trudeau to serve another term as prime minister after Liberals win plurality The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Trump has had a rough October MORE in the Canadian election. Biden truly wants us to believe he asked Obama not to endorse, let\u2019s take a listen.\n\nBiden's crowds? Well they're lackluster. his money raised from actual supporters? well they're not around. A general enthusiasm for his candidacy? Well that doesn't really exist. Ultimately, this is a lesson that 2016 forever broke the backs of those who try to cloak what\u2019s good for the American people in the traditional way of doing things. It resounded not just through the Republican Party but but the Democratic one as well.\n\nThis is actually great news for all of us. the fundamentals of American elections are shifting before our very eyes. The democratization of the internet means that traditional channels of \"stovepiped\" information can be gone around, and it means you can finally interface with the candidates and actually get to the point in which you need to find out who you should actually support.", "description": "Opinion: Saagar EnjetiThe veneer of Joe Biden for president is being slowly unraveled to the point of imminent political collapse.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/newsletteer-biden_102419getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
