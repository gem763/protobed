We first got to see Stadia at the Game Developer's Conference, or GDC this year. And now, Google at the Pixel 4 event revealed that Stadia will go live starting November 19. Here's everything you need to know about Google Stadia.\n\nGoogle/Reuters\n\nWhat is Google Stadia?\n\nToday, if someone wishes to game, they either require a console or a PC that has the firepower and hardware necessary to run the game while keeping things running smoothly. However, both of these things don't come cheap.\n\nA decent PS4 can cost you somewhere around Rs 28,000 whereas a gaming PC with a decent graphics card to run latest game titles would cost you at least Rs, 45,000, and it only gets higher with your hardware choices. Sure, mobile gaming is another way, but not all PC or Console games are available on iOS or Google Play Store. Google Stadia wants to simplify that.\n\nGoogle Stadia is a subscription-based cloud-gaming platform, where you subscribe to the service, and you can play the game on your phone or PC. The processing and running of the game will be taken care of on a cloud server that can run games at up to 4K resolutions. All you need is a fast internet connection (35Mbps and above) and a device that supports Goole Stadia and Google will take care of the rest. You can purchase games on the platform and play without worrying about anything else.\n\nDon't Miss\n\nGoogle Stadia: What do you play on?\n\nAt launch, Google Stadia will be supported on Google Pixel as well as a Stadia Founder's Edition combo, which includes a Google Chromecast Ultra streaming puck and a Stadia game controller (which costs $129, which is roughly Rs 9000).\n\nGoogle\n\nInitially, only the Pixel devices and the Chromeast 4K puck will support Stadia, but this is slowly expected to include other Android and iOS devices. The performance will be taken care of by the Google servers on the cloud.\n\nNo Need for Downloads\n\nImagine you're watching a game stream for PUBG on your browser and you wish to try the game out. All you'd need to do is click on the play now button, and the browser will take you straight to Stadia where it'll ask you to purchase the game (in case it isn't already in your library) and instantly run the game without the need to download anything on your device. How cool is that?\n\nReal-time Platform Switch\n\nGoogle Stadia, due to its cloud interface, supports real-time platform switch. But what does it mean? Imagine you're playing Destiny 2 on your TV (Using the Founder's Edition Combo) and you need to grab a train to commute. All you need to do is pause the game at home and you can pick up where you left off on your smartphone or tablet almost instantaneously (in a way similar to Netflix).\n\nGoogle Stadia Pricing and Availability\n\nAt launch, one can avail Google Stadia services by buying Google Stadia Founder's Edition. This will also give its users access to Stadia Pro for three months, post which it'll cost $9.99.\n\nGoogle\n\nWith Stadia Pro, users will get support for gaming in 4K at 60fps, along with support for 5.1-channel surround-sound audio. Google will also launch a standard Stadia subscription in 2020 which will support gaming at 1080p with stereo audio. The service is starting on November 19 in the US, Canada, UK, Europe. Dates for launch in India remain unknown.\n\nWill Google Stadia have free games?\n\nThis is where Google Stadia differs from Netflix. According to the AMA by Stadia on Reddit, Google Stadia is just a cloud platform that will let its users play games on the cloud, without the need of owning a physical gaming machine. Gamers will have to purchase games on Stadia's platform, just like they do with a standard PS4 or PC.\n\nGoogle: Games Coming to Stadia\n\nHowever, Stadia Pro users will roughly get one free game every month (give or take) to add to their library, Starting with Destiny 2. Moreover, if they chose to unsubscribe from the service, the free games will be held by Google. If they decide to sign back in, they could avail all those game in their library once again. However, Google hasn't given any clarity on the existing free games like Fortnite, Warframe or CS: GO.\n\nWill Google Stadia really make a difference for gamers on a budget in India?\n\nGoogle Stadia, especially with its standard subscription, seems promising, by delivering the convenience of not owning a console or gaming PC to play the game you love. However, it is difficult to say whether it'll create a strong mark in India as the most important thing necessary to run Google Stadia smoothly is a fast internet connection which can be a challenge for players in India.\n\nMoreover, many young Indian gamers rely on piracy to game offline, so they wouldn't really like the idea of paying for the games. Even players who would want to pay for their games would want to get a physical copy of a game, instead of an only-digital copy on the cloud. If someday Google decided to pull the plug on Stadia, gamers who have invested in their game library on Stadia won't be happy with that.\n\nGoogle\n\nIn India, mobile gaming is currently flourishing, with free-to-play games like PUBG, Pokemon Go, among others really stealing the show. India has completely skipped the generation of console gaming, something that countries like the US, UK and Japan are strongly, and the sudden access to addictive free-to-play games on app stores have rekindled the spark of gaming among teens and youngsters in the country.\n\nAnother concern is with Stadia only supporting Pixel devices as of now. With no hints of it coming to other Android or iOS devices, it seems like Google plans to attract buyers to switch to its Pixel smartphones. It tried to dab the budget section with its newly unveiled Pixel 3a, but with the fierce competition offering better hardware performance for the price, Google's didn't quite succeed.\n\nWhat do you feel about Google Stadia? Would you sign up for it? Do you think it has what it takes to survive in a budget-focused country like India? Let us know what you feel.", "description": "Google has been teasing its new game-streaming service for a while now. We first got to see Stadia at the Game Developer's Conference, or GDC this year.
