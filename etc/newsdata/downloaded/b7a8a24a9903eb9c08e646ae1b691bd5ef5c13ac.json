British Airways say they made a \u201cfair\u201d offer of an 11.5 per cent pay rise over three years, plus a one per cent bonus.\n\nThe deal was already accepted by members of the Unite and GMB unions, which represent 90 per cent of British Airways\u2019 staff.\n\nBALPA says that now the company is in better financial health, its members should see a greater share of the profits and have a mandate for strike action until January, raising fears of Christmas travel chaos.\n\nBritish Airways said on Sunday: \u201cWe're extremely sorry for the problems caused by the strike action called by the pilots\u2019 union, BALPA on 9, 10 and 27 September.\n\n\u201cWe continue to be available for constructive talks with BALPA, on the basis that there are no pre-conditions to those talks.\n\n\u201cIf you have a flight booked with us on those dates, it is likely that you will not be able to travel as planned due to BALPA\u2019s strike action. We are offering all affected customers full refunds or the option to re-book to another date of travel or alternative airline.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton said: \u201cBritish Airways needs to wake up and realise its pilots are determined to be heard.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve previously taken big pay cuts to help the company through hard times. Now BA is making billions of pounds of profit, its pilots have made a fair, reasonable and affordable claim for pay and benefits.", "description": "British Airways has told its passengers not to turn up at airports as the biggest strike action in the airline\u2019s 100 year history begins on Monday.
