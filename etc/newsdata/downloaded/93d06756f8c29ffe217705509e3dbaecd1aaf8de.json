Speaking to Rolling Stone, Darren Julien of Julien\u2019s Auctions says that it's still never been washed, explaining, \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we don\u2019t wash it. The stains are still there. There\u2019s even cigarettes [sic] burns that you can see on the sweater.\u201d Originally, Julien\u2019s obtained the sweater from \u201ca close friend of the Cobain family.\u201d Its current owner, an anonymous businessman, is storing it \"in acid-free tissue in a safe.\" Official bidding starts October 25 with a minimum bid of $200,000, which has already been matched; it's expected to reach upwards of $300,000 this time.\n\nWhile the urge to own a piece of history is obviously understandable, this is all very weird, sort of macabre, and solely attainable for bored rich people. Take this quote from Julien, where he tells Rolling Stone: \"Rock & roll memorabilia has become an investment. It\u2019s not just a collector\u2019s market\u2014it\u2019s an investor\u2019s market.\" He adds, \"I call it the new fine art market. People are investing more and more in pop culture, especially rock & roll. It\u2019s a way to diversify their portfolios.\u201d\n\nWith uncertainty in the economy, rising health care costs, and instability about the country's future, he might be onto something. If you're friends with a band about to achieve success, maybe steal their socks or something. They might be worth a quarter of a million dollars someday.", "description": "...For the low, low price of a down payment on a house.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9f5b4262c27f000945579f/lede/1570730909873-GettyImages-2225160.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8309xh;0xw,0xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
