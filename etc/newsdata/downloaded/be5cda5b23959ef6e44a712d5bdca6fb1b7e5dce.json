That is expected to be considered at a future hearing.\n\nBegum's lawyer Tasnime Akunjee (right) has argued that her husband Yago Riedijk (left) raped the teenager\n\nThere was anger earlier this year when it was revealed that Begum had received legal aid to launch the immigration appeal despite allegations that she had helped to stitch suicide bombers into their explosive vests and had worked to enforce IS's strict morality laws.\n\nBegum left Bethnal Green with two school friends in February 2015, when she was 15, and travelled to Syria to join the fanatics.\n\nOnce in the IS stronghold of Raqqa she married a jihadi fighter, Dutch convert Yago Riedijk, and went on to have three children with him.\n\nSpeaking before yesterday's hearing, her family's solicitor said she was effectively a rape victim because she was under 16 when she first became pregnant, and therefore below the legal age of consent.\n\nShe lived under IS control for three years before she was discovered in a refugee camp in a Kurdish-controlled area of Syria earlier this year.\n\nSpeaking in February, she said she had no regrets about joining IS but wanted to return to Britain because she was pregnant again and feared for her child's life.\n\nMr Javid stripped her of her British citizenship, saying she posed a threat to national security. Begum later recanted her support for IS and said her previous comments were an attempt to protect herself and her unborn child.\n\nThe child, a boy, died from pneumonia in the camp shortly after he was born. Her two other children also died as infants.\n\nLawyers for Begum said she had been moved to a different camp for her own safety after she was threatened by IS loyalists. They said the situation in Syria remained 'incredibly fragile and dangerous'.\n\nBegum (pictured) previously said that her mental health had been hindered by her experience\n\nThey said she was now 'abandoned' at the Al-Roj camp in 'wretched and squalid' conditions because of the decision to remove her citizenship.\n\nOther foreign detainees had been transferred to Iraqi custody and faced torture and unfair trials resulting in the death penalty, her lawyers said.\n\nIn court documents, Tom Hickman QC said she could also face execution if she travelled to Bangladesh.\n\nHe said there was no evidence Begum had ever visited Bangladesh or that she could speak Bengali.\n\nShe was a child when she left Britain and simply wanted to return home to her family, he added.\n\nHome Office lawyers said Begum was entitled to Bangladeshi citizenship 'by descent' and had not been left stateless.\n\nThe hearing continues.", "description": "Shamima Begum, 20, wanted to return to London but was left 'stateless' after then home secretary Sajid Javid removed her citizenship while she was held at a refugee camp in Syria.", "authors": ["Vanessa Allen For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/00/20060626-0-image-a-9_1571786675856.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
