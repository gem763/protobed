He died a coward,\u201d the president said. \u201cCrying, whimpering, screaming and bringing kids with him to die. Certain death.\u201d\n\nOther U.S. officials declined to describe Baghdadi\u2019s state in his last moments.\n\nHow the operation \u2014 named after Kayla Mueller, an American aid worker who was abducted and raped repeatedly by Baghdadi before she was killed, according to U.S. officials \u2014 came together is still something of a mystery. The troops included some Delta Force members, according to two U.S. officials, but other details, such as how they communicated with more senior commanders in Washington and beyond, and what weapons were involved, remain unknown.\n\nAD\n\nBut in colorful and at times taunting language, Trump revealed details Sunday morning of an operation that marks one of the major victories in the five-year U.S.-led campaign against the Islamic State.\n\nAD\n\nThe president, speaking at the White House, said he \u201cgot to watch\u201d much of the raid beginning about 5 p.m. in Washington. He credited undisclosed technology for giving him \u201cabsolutely perfect\u201d visuals that were \u201cas though you were watching a movie.\u201d\n\nTrump, who returned to the White House from golfing about 4 p.m., entered the Situation Room about an hour later, he said. Seated at a table in a navy suit and blue tie, he was flanked in a photo released by the White House by Vice President Pence, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien and two generals: Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Air Force Lt. Gen. Scott A. Howell, commander of Joint Special Operations Command.\n\nAD\n\nFlying after midnight in the Middle East, the helicopters needed to cross airspace controlled by Iraq, Turkey and Russia, and U.S. officials informed them they had an operation planned without providing details. With the Russians in Syria, the Pentagon has called such communication \u201cdeconfliction\u201d and said it has prevented accidents and mistaken intent by adversary forces.\n\nAD\n\nWhen they arrived, they tried to call Baghdadi out to see if he would surrender, Esper said. A couple of adults and 11 children came out, said one U.S. official with knowledge of the operation, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nBaghdadi remained inside, as U.S. officials assumed he might. U.S. forces responded by blowing holes in the side of the compound in an effort to avoid any booby-trapped doors, Trump said. Baghdadi retreated into a tunnel, and then detonated his vest.\n\nAD\n\nFive enemy fighters were killed in the operation in the compound, and others were killed outside, the White House said in a statement. O\u2019Brien, speaking in an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d said that U.S. troops confirmed that Baghdadi was dead at 7:15 p.m. in Washington.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe commander of the mission called and said, \u2018100 percent confidence, jackpot. . . . Got him. One hundred percent confidence jackpot, over,\u2019 \u201d O'Brien said.\n\nDespite Baghdadi's vest detonating, U.S. troops were able to recognize him, the official said. A ground commander reported to Marine Gen. Kenneth \u201cFrank\u201d McKenzie, chief of U.S. Central Command, that they were \u201cabsolutely convinced\u201d it was the Islamic State leader. McKenzie in turn relayed that message to the White House. The results of the DNA test were complete Sunday morning, the official said.\n\nAD\n\nMilley was \u201cemphatic\u201d that the military had to dispose of Baghdadi\u2019s remains in accordance with Muslim traditions, which typically require burial within 24 hours, the official said. When Navy SEALs killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, his body was buried at sea after traditional Islamic rites were performed. It was not clear Sunday whether that occurred in this case.\n\nAD\n\nThe remains of at least two wives were left behind. Trump said they had not detonated their vests and were still wearing them, making it too risky for U.S. troops to dispose of the bodies.\n\nTrump said that one U.S. working dog \u2014 described by the president as \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201ctalented\u201d \u2014 was wounded after chasing Baghdadi into the tunnel. Trump said that no U.S. troops were injured, but Esper said separately that two service members suffered minor injuries.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey've already been returned to duty,\u201d Esper said, speaking on CNN's \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nLess than 100 U.S. troops were on the ground in the raid, with more involved in a supporting role. Several kinds of aircraft were used in the operation, including CH-47 helicopters, the secretary added. They came under fire early in the mission from \u201clocals in the area,\u201d and the Americans returned fire in self-defense, he said.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nVideos circulating on social media Sunday from Barisha appear to depict helicopters flying at low altitudes in the dark, heavy gunfire and occasional explosions. Images taken after daybreak show the home where Baghdadi lived reduced to rubble. Esper said it was deliberately destroyed.\n\nAD\n\nTrump and other U.S. officials credited Syrian Kurdish forces \u2014 whose alliance in the battle against the militants the president has recently played down as he withdraws forces from Syria \u2014 with providing useful information. Mazloum Abdi, commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, said in a tweet that they had been gathering information about Baghdadi for five months, while Trump said the operation itself started two weeks ago once the United States had him \u201cscoped.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe thought he would be in a certain location,\u201d the president said. \u201cHe was. Things started checking out very well.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t clear how long Baghdadi would stay in Barisha, a small village west of Aleppo.\n\nAD\n\nPence, speaking on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d said the United States first received information about Baghdadi\u2019s most recent location early in the week.\n\n\u201cThrough a combination of intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, we believe we knew where he would be, and by Thursday afternoon were informed that there was a high probability he would be at the compound in Idlib province,\u201d Pence said.\n\n\n\nThe president directed the military to develop options, and they were presented Friday, Pence said. \u201cActionable intelligence\u201d obtained Saturday allowed the raid to go forward, he added.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was incredible to be in the Situation Room and to see this unfold in real time as our Special Forces were on the ground, to see their professionalism over a period of two hours,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica and the world are safer today with the leader of ISIS dead.\u201d\n\nMissy Ryan contributed to this report.", "description": "U.S. troops blew holes in the walls of the compound in which the ISIS leader was staying.
