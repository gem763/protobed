But his disregard of strict intelligence-sharing rules to protect highly placed sources \"prompted intelligence officials to renew earlier discussions about the potential risk\" that the source in Russia would be exposed, CNN reported.\n\nAt the Oval Office meeting, which took place one day after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, the president is said to have boasted to the Russians that firing \"nut job\" Comey had taken \"great pressure\" off him. Comey had been spearheading the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election.\n\nRead more: 'He's losing his s---': Trump's advisers are increasingly worried about his mental state following days of erratic behavior\n\nTrump then went on to share with Lavrov and Kislyak intelligence connected to the Islamic State in Syria. The information came from Israel, which had not given the US permission to share it with the Russians because it could have compromised an Israeli source in the region.\n\nThe report said that Mike Pompeo, the CIA director at the time, also told other senior Trump administration officials after the meeting that too much information was coming out regarding the US asset in Russia.\n\nThis is not the first time national-security veterans have expressed concerns that Trump's actions could reveal sensitive information about US intelligence-gathering processes and human sources working abroad.\n\nLate last month, the president's tweet about US military information he received during a classified intelligence briefing earlier that day immediately set off alarm bells because it included a satellite photo of an Iranian launchpad that was of a much higher resolution and better quality than the commercial satellite images of the site that were publicly available.\n\nRead more: Intelligence veterans are pulling their hair out over Trump's 'outrageous' and 'moronic' decision to tweet out a photo from a classified briefing\n\nIt also contained markers indicating that it was taken by USA-224, one of the US's most secretive spy satellites.\n\nIntelligence veterans said the president's tweet would be a gold mine for hostile foreign powers.\n\n\"One doesn't use intel for the purposes of taunting. The Russians and the Chinese will be very happy to study this,\" Robert Deitz, a former top lawyer at the CIA and the National Security Agency, told Insider.\n\nLast year, Trump also made the unusual decision to authorize the declassification of a highly controversial memo about the origins of the Russia investigation by Devin Nunes, then the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, for political purposes.\n\nThe memo and its release sparked a firestorm on Capitol Hill and within the intelligence community. Top intelligence officials met multiple times with senior White House staff to urge against releasing the document for fear that it could expose sources and methods.\n\nThe Justice Department and the FBI also took the extraordinary step of releasing statements cautioning against its release by the House Intelligence Committee without giving officials enough time to review it.", "description": "Intelligence officials typically extract sources when they believe the person's life is in immediate danger.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7470c32e22af4af35f5613-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
