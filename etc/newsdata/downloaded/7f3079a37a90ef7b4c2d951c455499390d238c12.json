So was Mr. Lai\u2019s business. No one was hurt.\n\nSince the democracy movement took to the streets of the Asian financial center in June, Communist China\u2019s state media have called Mr. Lai a traitor.\n\nHong Kong police have clubbed, beaten and imprisoned democracy movement demonstrators, so Mr. Schlapp and his colleagues knew the risk they were taking in hitting the streets of Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cWe have a long history of fighting communism,\u201d Mr. Schlapp said before the bombing.\n\nHe called it \u201cdisheartening\u201d to have to fight communism in, of all places, Hong Kong, a world-renowned island of freedom and capitalist prosperity. But he felt conservatism had to stand with the protestors in their struggle to stop \u201cBeijing\u2019s puppets in Hong Kong\u201d from letting China renege on a promise to let Hong Kong keep its democracy for 50 years.\n\nOn setting down in Hong Kong, Mr. Schlapp and his fellow conservatives began inviting Hong Kong students and other protesters to \u201cpop-up CPAC\u201d sessions featuring local experts and many of the Tokyo CPAC speakers.\n\nFighting authoritarianism left and right, so to speak, is a big reason his ACU\u2019s annual CPAC in Washington is the largest assemblage of activists anywhere. Despite \u2014 or maybe because \u2014 the left dominates the news and entertainment worlds, CPAC attracts presidents, presidential wannabes, lawmakers, occasional lawbreakers, governors, foreign leaders, secretaries of state, secretaries of the treasury and secretaries of everything else.\n\nInitially skeptical Hongkongers, until now alone in their stand against Beijing, quickly warmed to Mr. Schlapp and his fellow conservatives, telling them they are the first Westerners to show up in person to back them. (Yes, Japan\u2019s Mr. Aeba is not a Westerner, but the democracy demonstrators were out to show appreciation, not exactitude.)\n\nThat the American, Japanese and Australian conservative leaders took the risk and showed up together showed something else. The American conservative movement that William F. Buckley founded 55 years ago has become an international movement by spawning allied organizations with similar principles and goals in other nations.\n\n\u201cPeople all over the world who care about freedom are being inspired to fight for their rights,\u201d Mr. Schneider said. \u201cThis is a bottom-up, demand-driven movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a long time it was hard to define what constituted the conservative movement,\u201d Mr. Schneider said. \u201cIt is now clear. Millions and millions of people are now unifying in an unprecedented way in opposition to authoritarianism.\u201d\n\nMr. Chang sees in the Tokyo-Hong Kong events as \u201ca coming together \u2014 an emerging international movement.\u201d\n\nIt so happens that the day after the band of conservative leaders arrived from Tokyo, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam permanently withdrew a measure about extradition to China that at one point had sent 2 million Hongkongers into the streets in protest.\n\nShe undoubtedly responded to a signal from President (for Life) Xi Jinping of the People\u2019s Republic of China, who wants Oct. 1 to be a relatively blemish-free 70th anniversary of Chinese Communism. Nor does he want to risk uncontainable escalation of the trade war with Washington.\n\nThe measure that Mr. Xi had Mrs. Lam push would have mandated that Hong Kong political suspects be sent to the Chinese mainland where the communist legal system could try them and declare them guilty as charged.\n\nThat would be going back on a promise made to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when, in 1984, she signed over the British colony to China effective in 1997 at the end of the 99-year lease Britain had on Hong Kong. Part of the deal was the China would let Hong Kong keep its democracy for 50 years.\n\nTo be fair, a lot of conservatives thought China was so firmly embarked on the road to capitalism that surely the descendants of Mao Zedong would become Jeffersonians.\n\nThey haven\u2019t.\n\nBut Mr. Schlapp has stayed who he was: an American conservative leader.\n\nThank you, Matt.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
