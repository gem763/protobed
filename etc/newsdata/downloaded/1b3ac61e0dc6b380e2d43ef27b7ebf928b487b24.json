He said Saudi Arabia would have further to fall if a conflict took place.\n\nBreaking with the normal Saudi diplomatic silence in the UK, the ambassador, speaking at the Royal United Services Institute defence thinktank, said: \u201cThe Turkish assault is creating chaos. The last thing we need is another front of chaos in the region and I think we just got it.\u201d\n\nAsked about the US president\u2019s apparent sanctioning of the invasion last week, he said: \u201cWe are concerned, no question. What is happening in Syria with Turkey and the pulling out the troops does not give one incredible confidence.\u201d\n\nHe said he was disturbed by some recent remarks by Trump, describing him as \u201ca tweet monster\u201d, but conceding sometimes these tweets were just the president\u2019s initial reaction.\n\nHe pointed to the US decision to send troops and air defences to Saudi as a sign of the continuing US commitment to the Middle East, but he warned, in a reference to Saudi Arabia\u2019s rival Iran: \u201cWho has benefited from every single disaster in the Middle East in the past 10 years ? It ain\u2019t Saudi Arabia, for sure.\u201d\n\nPrince Khalid pushed back on claims, repeated on Monday by Trump, that Saudi Arabia acts only in self interest and was incapable of surviving without US support. He said Saudi Arabia had acted in world\u2019s interest, pointing out that it could easily \u201chave let oil prices skyrocket and made millions and millions more than it had made. We tried to control it because it would not have been good for the world. If the world gets ill, Saudi Arabia gets ill.\u201d\n\nThe region, he added \u201cneeds more adults in the room and we are trying to behave like that. The last thing we need is to see things get out of control.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have been trying to be a calming player\u201d. Referring to the surprise attack on oil tankers in Gulf in the summer, attributed to Iran, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t think people realise how close we were to significant conflict after the initial tanker attacks. That was really out of the blue. We did not expect the Iranians to get involved in that kind of attack. It was quite brazen.\n\n\u201cWe do not want to be a hegemonic player in the region. Quite the opposite, if anything; we just want to be left alone. It just so happens we have two of the most desired things in the world \u2013 the holy cities of Islam, and oil.\u201d\n\nHe denied Saudi\u2019s refusal to mount a military counter attack against Iranian attacks represented appeasement, but said Riyadh had tried to reach out to Iran a decade ago, only to be rebuffed.\n\nAlthough Prince Khalid admitted \u201cmany things had gone wrong in the war in Yemen\u201d, he defended the initial intervention, but did not set out a plan to bring about peace, saying it was for the Houthis to come to the negotiating table. \u201cWe are dealing with people that use subterfuge as part of their political process,\u201d he claimed.\n\nHe admitted the Saudi government\u2019s initial response had been wild when it was reported Saudi officials were responsible for the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi last year in the Saudi consulate in Ankara, Turkey.\n\nThe episode was a stain on Saudi society, he admitted. \u201cOnce the truth started coming out, it was a shock to the system and when you are in shock, you respond poorly and part of our reaction was clouded in the craziness of what happened,\u201d he said.", "description": "New envoy to UK also says Riyadh is losing confidence in Donald Trump", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6942a2c0771ca98126ccdd983cbdda2cf57d3bbd/0_454_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=210084db00120a64bed4332d717bbff4", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
