A Sound of Thunder (2005)\n\nStarring Edward Burns, Catherine McCormack and Ben Kingsley this adaptation of author Ray Bradbury\u2019s short story of the same name cost an estimated \u00a365.46 million to produce.\n\nBut it only grossed a paltry \u00a35.16 million worldwide, meaning the film lost an estimated \u00a360.31 million.\n\n6. Renegades (2017)\n\nThis action thriller starring Sullivan Stapleton and JK Simmons follows a group of Navy SEALS asked to salvage Nazi gold at the bottom of a Bosnian lake.\n\nThe film only grossed a feeble \u00a31.23 million against its \u00a363.42 million budget.\n\n5.

The Adventures of Pluto Nash (2002)\n\nStarring Eddie Murphy in a dual role, the critically panned sci-fi comedy managed to earn a Razzie nomination for worst film, worst actor, worst director, worst screenplay and worst on-screen couple (both for Eddie Murphy and a cloned version of himself).\n\nIt managed to make just \u00a35.73 million on a budget of \u00a381.83 million.\n\n(Image: Warner Bros)\n\n3. Town and Country (2001)\n\nThis rom-com Starring Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn and Garry Schandling was plagued by constant reshoots that stretched the initial budget of \u00a336 million to a whopping \u00a385.92 million.\n\nTown and Country only managed to make \u00a38.43 million at the box office and Warren Beatty didn\u2019t appear in another motion picture for 15 years.\n\n2. Dark Phoenix (2019)\n\nWith Sophie Turner playing the eponymous star, the latest instalment of the long-running X-Men franchise didn\u2019t share the same success its Marvel counterparts usually enjoy.\n\nAfter initial test screenings were received poorly, the entire third act of the film was completely reshot contributing to the massive \u00a3286.40 million budget.\n\nThe film only managed to make \u00a3201.54 million back and director Simon Kinberg publicly took responsibility for the poor reception of the film.\n\n1.
