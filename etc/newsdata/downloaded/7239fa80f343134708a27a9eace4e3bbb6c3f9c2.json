I\u2019m gonna place him next to my mother and father.\u2019\n\nThe pair are facing each other in the ring on 9 November (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nHe went on to warn his pals: \u2018And by the way, if anyone in my family and friends section asks Bieber for a picture, I am kicking you the f*** out.
