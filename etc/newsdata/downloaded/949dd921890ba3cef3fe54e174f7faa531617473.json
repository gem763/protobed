I am a player of Arsenal and have another two years of contract,\u201d he said. \u201cI was never the one who starts a war when something does not work out.\n\n\u201cIf something turns out, I\u2019m open to taking the next step. If not, then I will continue my football.\n\n\u201cThe coach told me that he sees me the same way as any player in the team. I do not want to say that this is not an issue. I have a wife and two children and that has to be sanctioned.\n\n\u201cIf at some point a club from Germany has interest and it fits, I\u2019m open for it.\u201d", "description": "Arsenal defender Shkodran Mustafi has responded to a fan on Twitter with a sarcastic apology after it was revealed the Germany international has kept two clean sheets in two appearances this season.
