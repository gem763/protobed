REUTERS/Scott Morgan\n\nThe Wall Street Journal and the New York Times on Friday reported that during a July phone call Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the involvement of Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, with a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nThe phone call between the two world leaders was reportedly part of a whistleblower complaint against Trump from within the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nThe reports about the phone call also said Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate whether Biden misused his position as vice president under former President Barack Obama to threaten to withhold U.S. aid unless a prosecutor who had investigated the energy company in which Biden\u2019s son was involved was fired.\n\nBiden, now a Democratic presidential hopeful, has confirmed he wanted the prosecutor fired. But no evidence has emerged that the former vice president did so to help his son. The wider U.S. government, the European Union and other international institutions also wanted the prosecutor fired because of an alleged failure to pursue major corruption cases.\n\nThe following timeline details key moments in the Biden family\u2019s involvement in Ukrainian affairs and Trump\u2019s effort to use those actions as political ammunition.\n\nApril 21, 2014: Biden, then vice president, visited Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kiev, in a show of support for the country\u2019s government amid rising tensions with Russia.\n\nMay 13, 2014: Burisma Group, a private company that has drilled for natural gas in Ukraine since 2002, announced that Hunter Biden would be joining its board. Around that time, Burisma\u2019s founder, a former government official named Mykola Zlochevsky, was under investigation for alleged money laundering by Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office.\n\nDec. 8, 2015: Biden visited Kiev again and spoke out against bureaucratic corruption that he said was eating Ukraine \u201clike a cancer.\u201d Biden threatened to withhold loan guarantees unless Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who had been widely accused of corruption, was removed.\n\nShokin had investigated Burisma but the probe was dormant at the time Biden pushed for the prosecutor\u2019s termination, Bloomberg reported earlier this year, citing a former Ukrainian official.\n\nMarch 29, 2016: The Ukrainian Parliament voted to remove Shokin.\n\nJan. 23, 2018: Biden, at a Council on Foreign Relations event, detailed how he had threatened to withhold funds from Ukraine if Shokin was not removed.\n\nApril 2019: Hunter Biden\u2019s term as a Burisma board member expired and he stepped down from the company.\n\nMay 16, 2019: Bloomberg quotes Ukraine\u2019s current top prosecutor as saying he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden or his father.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivers a speech during a parliamentary session in Kiev, Ukraine August 29, 2019.

Giuliani came under criticism from Democratic lawmakers after saying in media interviews that he had planned to meet with Ukraine\u2019s new leaders and push for investigations that could help Trump.\n\nJuly 25, 2019: Trump spoke with Zelenskiy and reportedly pressured him to investigate Hunter Biden.\n\nAug. 12, 2019: A whistleblower from within the intelligence community lodged a complaint with a internal watchdog that reportedly focused on Trump\u2019s contacts with Ukraine.", "description": "Some Democrats are calling for the impeachment of U.S. President Donald Trump over reports that he asked his Ukrainian counterpart to launch an investigation that could damage his Democratic political rival Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Jan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433084264&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1ZX", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
