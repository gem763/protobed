Security forces have stepped up their presence in major cities and have been conducting spot checks of mobile phones for political content.\n\nSisi, in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, indirectly accused the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood of stirring up the protests, saying \"political Islam\" was to blame.\n\nAnalysts say it won't be easy to curb dissent without addressing its economic and political causes. Many Egyptians distrust government promises after three years of austerity agreed with the International Monetary Fund in exchange for a $12 billion loan.\n\nSince then, Egypt has introduced valued-added tax, devalued the currency and raised the prices of electricity and fuel.\n\n\n\n\n\nTURMOIL\n\nSisi remains popular among many ordinary people for stabilizing Egypt after the fall of Hosni Mubarak in 2011 led to turmoil that scared away tourists and foreign investors, and brought the public finances close to collapse.\n\nBut the austerity measures, which were accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, heaped pressure on many. The number of Egyptians living below the poverty line rose to 32.5% in the 2017/18 financial year from 27.8% two years earlier.\n\n\"What happened is a very serious warning, the situation is not totally under control,\" said Mohamed Zaree of the non-governmental Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies.\n\nHe said most people who took to the streets were not members of organized political parties \"which shows that there is public anger\".\n\nThe protesters lack leaders, political affiliations and coordination, analysts said. The crowds were spontaneous, making the protests difficult to control.\n\n\"It's not clear whether protests will escalate or fizzle right now,\" said Michele Dunne, director of the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"But if not this week, protests are likely to return in the coming weeks and months.\"\n\nSeveral Cairo residents said hardship was driving the protests, and they might join in if they could be sure of safety in numbers.\n\n\"It depends on the size of the protest. If many people join, I might too,\" said a driver who gave his name only as Abdallah.\n\n\"If numbers are too small it is too unsafe,\" he said before adding: \"People are fed up.\"\n\nA 40-year-old engineer who used to support Sisi until austerity started to bite said: \"I will take part in Friday's protests. I'm unhappy with where the country is going.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEOS\n\nThe protests came after videos posted from Spain by Mohamed Ali, a hitherto little-known actor and building contractor, were widely shared online. He accused Sisi and parts of the military of corruption and squandering funds on projects such as new presidential palaces.\n\nSisi denied the claims. State media have tried to discredit Ali's motives, and have broadcast pro-Sisi songs and reports on his achievements, while also warning against destabilisation.\n\nThis has not stopped other dissidents uploading videos discussing the security crackdown, corruption and poverty.\n\nAhdaf Soueif, an Egyptian novelist, said Ali's videos had struck a chord because he casts himself as a self-made man with a modest background.\n\n\"He is what the millions of young Egyptian men with brains and ambition and a sense that the dice are loaded against them would wish to be,\" she said. \"The system has no idea how to deal with him.\"\n\nThe fact that protesters managed to gather at all has prompted some to suggest that officials were unsure on how to respond.", "description": "Scattered protests in Egypt in the past few days highlight the risk that President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi could face broader dissent, driven by grievances over economic austerity and allegations of official corruption.
