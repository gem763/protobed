Here\u2019s Why.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nYou might think that not much happened in Saudi Arabia over the past week if you were watching the kingdom\u2019s financial markets.\n\nThe iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia exchange-traded fund (ticker: KSA) is up a hair since Sept. 14, when the Abqaiq refinery drone attack knocked out half of the country\u2019s oil production. Yields on Saudi bonds jumped by a percentage point after the attack, then quickly reverted to about 3%. Stocks in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia\u2019s closest regional ally, were unmoved.\n\nThere are sound technical reasons for the steady performance. Saudi shares had already fallen 15% since early May, as oil prices slipped and enthusiasm around the country\u2019s joining MSCI\u2019s global emerging markets index faded. \u201cSaudi has been on the back foot since the MSCI inclusion,\u201d says Michael Irsaneous, head of Middle East equity sales at emerging markets broker Auerbach Grayson. \u201cIt rallied until April, then sold off.\u201d\n\nGlobal starvation for yield is buoying Saudi bond prices. At 3%, investors already get a risk premium for Riyadh\u2019s sovereign debt. Other countries with similar A ratings, like Chile or Poland, pay about 2.4%, says Edwin Gutierrez, head of emerging markets sovereign debt at Aberdeen Asset Management. When the yield bounced after the bombing, Asian investors leapt in and brought it back down. \u201cThis was like the holy grail for Taiwanese guys struggling for return,\u201d he says.\n\nGutierrez himself remains a buyer of Saudi credit at 3%, betting that it will \u201cconverge over time\u201d with its peer group. (Bond prices go up as yields go down.) Ricardo Adrogue, head of emerging markets debt at Barings, begs to differ. Saudi and its Gulf neighbors have gorged on some $150 billion in sovereign debt since 2016, just as tensions between the kingdom and regional rival Iran ratchet up. \u201cWe feel smart now for being cautious in a region with such high geopolitical risk,\u201d he says.\n\nWhatever the tactical calculus for investors, the idea that Saudi Arabia can smoothly return to business as usual after Abqaiq evokes a \u201cdegree of disbelief,\u201d says Simon Henderson, director of Gulf and energy policy at the Washington Institute.\n\nRiyadh\u2019s 34-year-old leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has a multidecade master plan to diversify the economy beyond oil. The first step was supposed to be raising $100 billion from listing 5% of state crude monopoly Saudi Aramco. The sale will \u201cat the very least need to be repackaged\u201d post-bombing, Henderson says, though Saudi officials vowed to steam ahead.\n\nMore speculative is how the attack, and Riyadh\u2019s so-far hesitant response, will affect the prestige of MBS, as the crown prince is known. He acts as his own defense minister and brought in his younger brother as deputy, making it hard to lay blame elsewhere. \u201cThe wider royal family probably thinks, \u2018What a disaster!\u2019 \u201d Henderson says.\n\nInvestors hunting for bargains on the next round of Middle East volatility should think about Egypt, Irsaneous says. Cairo stocks fell as much as 3.5% after the Abqaiq assault (then bounced back), even though the largest Arab nation is far from the line of fire. Unlike the Gulf petro states, Egypt offers a dynamic domestic story, with growth cruising above 5% annually, and inflation down by half over the past year.\n\n\u201cMost of our investors are overweight Egypt,\u201d Irsaneous says. \u201cThis is a market where the fundamentals are very good.\u201d", "description": "Saudi shares had already fallen 15% since early May, as oil prices slipped and enthusiasm around the country\u2019s joining MSCI\u2019s global emerging markets index faded.", "authors": ["Craig Mellow"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-107978/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
