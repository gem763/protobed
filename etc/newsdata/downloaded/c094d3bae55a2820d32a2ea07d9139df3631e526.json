It just took a lot of time and growth to get to that place.\"\n\nHe said Blurred Lines was the turning point for him but he admitted that at first he \"didn't get\" why the song received such a backlash by some.\n\nThe song - which was a collaboration with Robin Thicke - includes lines such as \"I hate these blurred lines, I know you want it\" and \"Must wanna get nasty\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Model Emily Ratajkowski rose to stardom after appearing in the Blurred Lines video\n\nThe singer said he saw that some women really liked the song and would sing those type of lyrics all the time.\n\n\"So it's like 'What's rapey about that?'\n\n\"And then I realised that there are men who use that same language when taking advantage of a woman, and it doesn't matter that that's not my behaviour. Or the way I think about things.\n\n\"It just matters how it affects women. And I was like, Got it. I get it. Cool.\"\n\nHe added: \"I realised that we live in a chauvinist culture in our country. I hadn't realised that. Didn't realise that some of my songs catered to that. So that blew my mind.\"\n\nBlurred Lines spent five weeks at number one in the UK charts and Pharrell has previously defended its lyrics.\n\nIn an interview with Pitchfork in 2014, he said: \"When you pull back and look at the entire song, the point is she's a good girl, and even good girls want to do things, and that's where you have the blurred lines.\n\n\"She expresses it in dancing because she's a good girl. People who are agitated just want to be mad, and I accept their opinion.\"\n\nPharrell and Robin Thicke have also had other issues over the song Blurred Lines.\n\nThey were told to pay $5m (\u00a34m) in damages after Marvin Gaye's family claimed the song copied Gaye's 1977 hit Got to Give It Up.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "The singer says the backlash made him realise some of his songs \"catered\" to a \"chauvinist culture\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4A09/production/_109235981_gettyimages-1174326148.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
