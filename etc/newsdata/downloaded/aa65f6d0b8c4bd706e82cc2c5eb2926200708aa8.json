All three judges were nominated by Republican presidents.\n\nAD\n\nThe panel found that the two jurisdictions lack standing to pursue claims against the president and granted a petition for a rare writ of mandamus, directing U.S. District Court Judge Peter Messitte to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nThe decision to allow a full-court hearing brought renewed resolve from officials in Maryland and the District of Columbia, who argued that hotels in their jurisdictions suffer \u201ccompetitive injury\u201d because officials hoping to curry favor with the president are more likely to stay at his hotel.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEvery single day, President Trump receives payments from foreign governments and from the United States. We intend to hold him accountable for violations of our nation\u2019s original anti-corruption laws,\u201d Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said in a statement.\n\nThe case is one of three that argue the president is violating the emoluments provision, which prohibits federal officials from accepting benefits from foreign or state governments without congressional approval.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s legal team had argued that Frosh and District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine \u2014 both Democrats \u2014 lack authority to sue the president in his official capacity. Trump\u2019s lawyers also argued that the emoluments clause only bars compensation made in connection with services provided in his official capacity or in \u201can employment-type relationship\u201d with a foreign or domestic government.\n\nAD\n\nThe DOJ declined to comment Tuesday after the 4th Circuit announced that the full court will hear the case.\n\nThe three-judge panel was sharply critical of the lawsuit when it ruled in Trump\u2019s favor, writing that Maryland and the District\u2019s \u201cinterest in enforcing the Emoluments Clauses is so attenuated and abstract that their prosecution of this case readily provokes the question of whether this action against the President is an appropriate use of the courts.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAt the time, Trump heralded the decision in a tweet, saying, \u201cWord just out that I won a big part of the Deep State and Democrat induced Witch Hunt.\u201d Trump tweeted that he doesn\u2019t make money but loses \u201ca fortune\u201d by serving as president.\n\nThe hotel is just blocks from the White House. The iconic Old Post Office quickly became a hot spot for lobbyists and foreign officials after it reopened in October 2016 \u2014 shortly before Trump was elected \u2014 as the Trump International Hotel.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
