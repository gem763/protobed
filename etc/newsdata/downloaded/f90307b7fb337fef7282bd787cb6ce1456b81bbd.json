At least 20 Republican senators would have to join all 45 Democrats and two independents to convict and oust Trump from office if an impeachment trial occurs.\n\nSome GOP senators were reportedly stunned in private on Wednesday after the Trump administration released a rough transcript of a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodomyr Zelensky. It showed Trump asking Zelensky to work alongside Attorney General Bill Barr to investigate Biden's past conduct in the country. Trump also offered to meet with Zelensky at the White House after he promised to conduct such an inquiry.\n\nRead more: The White House has a complete transcript of Ukraine call but hid it in a possible abuse of power, whistleblower complaint says\n\nThe transcript \u2014 combined with the disclosure of a whistleblower complaint filed against Trump from an officer at the Central Intelligence Agency \u2014 transformed the political debate around impeachment in only a few days. It also raised some alarm on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"Clearly what we've seen from the transcript itself is deeply troubling,\" Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah told reporters on Tuesday. And Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska said Republicans \"ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons and say there's no 'there' there when there's obviously a lot that's very troubling there.\"\n\nMitt Romney More\n\nBill Clark/CQ Roll Call\n\nMost Republicans, though, have staunchly defended Trump in public against the impeachment proceedings and accused Democrats of overreach. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas went on Fox News Friday to blast the inquiry as \"just about attacking the president.\" House Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell told Politico that it is \"laughable to think this is anywhere close to an impeachable offense.\"\n\nStill, Republicans are aware that more damaging information on Trump may come out in the coming months, and the proceedings casted a cloud of uncertainty on its impact on public opinion heading into the 2020 presidential election.\n\nRead more: A timeline of Trump's campaign to pressure Ukraine's president into investigating Joe Biden\n\n\"Our sense is that it is still much too early to tell what the political impact of all of this is going to be,\" one Republican strategist with Senate campaign experience told the Wall Street Journal. \"Everyone's going to be watching over the coming weeks to see how the numbers on impeachment move in public polling. I think particularly how independents see it.\"", "description": "Barring more significant revelations, GOP senators are unlikely to support impeaching President Donald Trump,", "authors": ["Joseph Zeballos-Roig"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MQUGbAp9zgqjJcRs.RL6kQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/beb94a848d3aea76767cf300034977e9", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
