You don\u2019t want an election. Let\u2019s get on with the people\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s Brexit dilemma is its most consequential political decision since World War Two.\n\nOpponents of a no-deal exit say it would be a disaster for the economy, while Brexit supporters are eager to cut Britain free from what they see as a doomed experiment in integration that has seen Europe fall behind China and the United States.\n\nJohnson, the face of the Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum, said that if lawmakers voted to delay Brexit they would \u201cplainly chop the legs out from under the UK position and make any further negotiation absolutely impossible\u201d.\n\nIf parliament defeats the government on Brexit, a vote on holding an election will be held on Wednesday with an election date of Oct. 14, according to a senior government source.\n\nBIG STAKES\n\nThe intervention by Johnson was part of the high-stakes political chess game over Brexit ahead of parliament\u2019s return from its summer break on Tuesday.\n\nRebels and opponents of the government say Johnson is betting on an election that he will cast as being forced on him by opponents of Brexit in parliament.\n\nLawmakers opposed to a no-deal Brexit will seek on Tuesday to take control of parliamentary time on Wednesday to pass legislation which would force Johnson to seek a three-month delay to Brexit.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson gestures during a news conference at the end of the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, August 26, 2019. REUTERS/Dylan Martinez/File Photo\n\nMore than three years since the United Kingdom voted 52-48% to leave the EU, it is still unclear on what terms, or indeed whether, Brexit will take place.\n\nAfter Johnson\u2019s enforcers warned rebels they would be kicked out of the party if they defied him, speculation mounted he would call for an election just days before an EU summit due on Oct. 17-18.\n\nUnder British law, two-thirds of lawmakers must support holding an early election, and Johnson is not certain to get that backing.\n\nThe United Kingdom has held a variety of extraordinary votes in recent years. In 2014, Scots rejected independence in a referendum; in 2015, then prime minister David Cameron won a surprise majority on a pledge to hold an EU referendum but lost the referendum the following year.\n\nAfter winning the top job in the chaos following the referendum, May bet on a 2017 snap election but lost her majority. Johnson took over from May in July after she failed three times to get a Brexit deal through parliament.\n\nNO-DEAL BREXIT CLOSER?\n\nThe default position is that Britain will leave on Oct. 31 without a deal unless a divorce agreement is struck with the bloc and ratified by the British parliament or legislation is passed to delay or revoke the departure notice.\n\nJ.P. Morgan said in a research note it believed Monday\u2019s developments made a no-deal more likely as it increased the chances of an election and opinion polls suggest Johnson could win an election campaigning for a no-deal mandate.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nJohnson, 55, has cast rebels as EU \u201ccollaborators\u201d who are undermining the government\u2019s negotiating hand in seeking a withdrawal agreement by blunting his threat of a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cTheir (the government\u2019s) strategy, to be honest, is to lose this week and then seek a general election,\u201d said David Gauke, a former justice minister who is one of the rebel Conservative lawmakers.\n\nJohnson has a working majority of just one seat in the 650-seat lower house of parliament and British media suggested about 20 Conservative lawmakers were prepared to rebel against him.\n\nAn election would open up three main options: a Brexit-supporting government under Johnson, a Labour government led by veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn or a hung parliament that could lead to a coalition or minority government of some kind.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson implicitly warned lawmakers on Monday that he would seek an election if they tied his hands on Brexit, ruling out ever countenancing a further delay to Britain's departure from the European Union.", "authors": ["Guy Faulconbridge", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425303746&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810FB"}
