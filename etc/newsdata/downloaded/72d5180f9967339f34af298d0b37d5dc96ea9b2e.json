Brexit continues to be a contentious debate around The UK and Northern Ireland. (AP Photo/Peter Morrison)\n\nBRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 European Union officials hoped to sketch out a Brexit deal with Britain within hours, but negotiations stretched into early Wednesday in the latest effort at producing an agreement in more than three years of false starts and sudden reversals.\n\nThe bloc said it might be possible to strike a divorce deal by Thursday's EU leaders' summit, which comes just two weeks before the U.K's scheduled departure date of Oct. 31. One major proviso: The British government must make more compromises to seal an agreement in the coming hours.\n\nBritain and the EU have been here before \u2014 within sight of a deal only to see it dashed \u2014 but a surge in the British pound Tuesday indicated hope that this time could be different. The currency rose against the dollar to its highest level in months.\n\nEven though many questions remain, diplomats made it clear that both sides were within touching distance of a deal for the first time since a U.K. withdrawal plan fell apart in the British House of Commons in March.\n\nStill, talks that first lingered into Tuesday night turned into negotiating past midnight as no deal materialized between experts from both sides holed up at EU headquarters in a darkened Brussels.\n\nLate Tuesday, Martin Schirdewan, a German member of the European Parliament's Brexit Steering Group, said an agreement was \"now within our grasp\" following a breakthrough in negotiations.\n\nThis week's EU leaders' meeting \u2014 the last scheduled summit before the Brexit deadline \u2014 was long considered the last opportunity to approve a divorce agreement. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists his country will leave at the end of the month with or without an agreement, although U.K. lawmakers are determined to push for another delay rather than risk a chaotic no-deal Brexit.\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, said at a meeting of the bloc's ministers in Luxembourg on Tuesday that the main challenge now is to turn the new British proposals on the complex Irish border issue into something legally binding. EU member Ireland has a land border with the U.K.'s Northern Ireland, and both want to keep goods and people flowing freely across the currently invisible frontier.\n\nA frictionless border underpins both the local economy and the 1998 peace accord that ended decades of Catholic-Protestant violence in Northern Ireland. But once Britain exits, that border will turn into an external EU frontier that the bloc wants to keep secure.\n\nBarnier wants a clear answer by Wednesday morning, so EU capitals can prepare for the bloc's two-day summit that begins Thursday. \"It is still possible this week,\" said Barnier. As so often, intricate details kept hopes from turning into immediate reality.\n\nThe big question is how far Johnson's government is prepared to budge on its insistence that the U.K., including Northern Ireland, must leave the European Union's customs union \u2014 something that would require checks on goods passing between the U.K. and the EU, including on the island of Ireland.\n\nThe British government has given away little detail of the proposals it has made on the issue; even government ministers have not been told specifics. In broad terms, the U.K. is proposing that Northern Ireland \u2014 but not the rest of the U.K. \u2014 continue to follow EU customs rules and tariffs after Brexit in order to remove the need for border checks.\n\nBut that sounds like a customs union in all but name \u2014 and would mean new checks or tariffs on some goods moving between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.\n\nAn EU official said Barnier told a teleconference of some lawmakers that the Irish Sea would largely become the customs border between the EU and the U.K. That would avoid having a visible land border on the island of Ireland between the two. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were ongoing.\n\nBut Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, the party that props up Johnson's minority government, strongly opposes any measures that could loosen the bonds between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.\n\nAfter DUP leaders met with Johnson late Tuesday at the prime minister's office, the party said negotiations continued but \"it would be fair to indicate gaps remain and further work is required.\"", "description": "European Union officials hoped to sketch out a Brexit deal with Britain within hours, but negotiations stretched into early Wednesday in the latest effort at producing an agreement in more than three years of false starts and sudden reversals.
