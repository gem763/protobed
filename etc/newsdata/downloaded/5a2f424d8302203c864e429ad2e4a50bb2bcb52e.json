Bush presidency, there was appetite again for a second try. Horror stories of America\u2019s shambolic system were everywhere in the 2000\u2019s. From Michael Moore\u2019s \u201cSicko\u201d to songs by Conor Oberst\u2014\u201cOh, we got no health insurance, no cellular service, no disease, they can cure\u201d\u2014it seemed healthcare, as much as the failing financial system, and the fraught wars abroad, was foremost in everyone\u2019s minds.\n\nIn the middle part of the naughties, leading Republicans championed an approach they thought would help preserve the market system\u2014most notably RomneyCare, shepherded in by then-Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. Years later, the Right and Romney himself would reject the approach nationally. But the Romney system relied on the individual mandate\u2014that is, requiring citizens to buy private insurance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe leading Democrats in the 2008 primary\u2014then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, then-Sen. Barack Obama, and 2004 primary runner-up John Edwards\u2014were divided on the matter. Clinton and Edwards favored a mandate, while Obama, often portrayed as furthest left of the trio, actually opposed the mandate. As president, of course, Obama would change his mind and deem it necessary for American healthcare reform.\n\nHeading into 2020, as Democrats nominate a post-Obama, post-Clinton standard-bearer for the first time in years, healthcare still weighs heavily on the minds of both voters and party elites. Obamacare, a relatively moderate, technocratic fix, the thinking goes, cost an ocean of political capital for the Left, only to be dynamited by President Obama\u2019s political successor. Obama didn\u2019t even get a prime attraction of his program through\u2014the public option, that is, a real-deal government rival to private insurance.\n\nIf the Left is going to do healthcare reform, the thinking goes, why not go for gold? Republicans will work to sunder any attempt, anyways. As Mayor Pete Buttigieg said this earlier this year: \u201cIf we adopt a platform way out to the left, they\u2019re going to say we\u2019re socialists. If we adopt a more moderate or conservative platform, they\u2019re going to say we\u2019re socialists. So, we might as well just do what we think is right, make the case for it and then let them do what they want.\u201d\n\nThis dynamic was on full display Tuesday night in Ohio.\n\nThe hardcore option is so-called \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d most commonly associated with front-runner Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, the latter of whom wrote the bill in the Senate, as he reminded us Tuesday night. Warren, whose stock has rocketed in recent weeks, was needled for lack of specificity on how she would pay for the watershed program. Said Sanders: \u201cAs someone who wrote the damn bill \u2026 I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They will go up significantly for the wealthy and for virtually everybody, the tax increase will be substantially less.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s other rivals pulled fewer punches. \u201cI believe the best and boldest idea here is to not trash Obamacare,\u201d said Sen. Amy Klobachur, a consensus breakout star of the debate. \u201cBut to do what Barack Obama wanted to do from the beginning and that\u2019s have a public option that would bring down the cost of the premium, and expand the number of people covered, and take on the pharmaceutical companies. That is what we should be doing.\u201d Klobachur added, clearly directing her aim at Warren: \u201cInstead of kicking 149 million people off their insurance.\u201d\n\nThe Minnesota senator said the Massachusetts senator\u2019s ambivalence toward repairing Obamacare was evidence that she had bought into \u201cRepublican talking points\u201d; Warren said Klobachur\u2019s refusal to embrace a bigger approach also represented bringing a conservative spirit to the problem.\n\nThe Warren-Klobachur fracas was emblematic of the fight between the increasingly warring camps on America\u2019s Left: between medicare-for-all and the less ambitious public option, which would offer a Medicare-like plan to folks under 65 and is embraced by Klobachur, the label-ambivalent Buttigieg, and former Vice President Joe Biden. The ex-veep, like Sanders, was quick to remind voters of his relevance to this debate, recalling that he backed the public option hard while in the White House.\n\nIndustry is not sleeping on this dynamic, either. Major insurer Kaiser Permanente has released a survey implicitly favorable to the Biden-Buttigieg-Klobuchar approach, finding only fifty-one percent of people want Medicare-for-all \u2014 down from nearly sixty percent last year, before the primary debate kicked out. Kaiser, for its worth, found that 73 percent of people favored a public option. \u201cBiden has cast \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 as \u2018getting rid of Obamacare\u2019 and Mayor Pete has said you don\u2019t need to gut private health insurance to get to universal coverage,\u201d Washington Examiner senior healthcare reporter Kimberly Leonard told me.\n\nThe Democratic Party represents the hopes for millions of disenfranchised and struggling Americans. But its fundamental tensions with its Left is that the party is also composed of much of America\u2019s educated elite, who are generally just fine with their healthcare coverage, thank you very much.\n\nIn 2017, Democrats in Virginia and New Jersey rode the healthcare issue to a ballot box bonanza, after the abortive Trump admin healthcare overhaul. Leading Dem strategists hope to repeat that success again. But for a party that hopes to unite before the summer and above all else\u2014replace Donald Trump\u2014the now open rift on a such a seminal issue is worrying.\n\nCurt Mills is senior writer for The American Conservative.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/klobuchar.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
