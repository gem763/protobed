New conservative media outlet prepares to launch.", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s easy to think of the soon-to-be launched conservative news site run by two prominent Never Trump conservatives as an outlet created simply to bash the president.\n\nBut Jonah Goldberg, one of the two co-founders, said that\u2019s not quite right.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be an anti-Trump thing,\u201d Goldberg said in an interview on the Yahoo News podcast, \u201cThe Long Game.\u201d \u201cWe kinda want to be a post-Trump thing.\u201d\n\nGoldberg is in the process of leaving his job at the National Review to join former Weekly Standard editor-in-chief Stephen Hayes at the yet-to-be named new outlet. They hope to launch this fall, he said.\n\nThe Weekly Standard \u2014 which had been co-founded by one of the most prominent anti-Trump conservatives, Bill Kristol \u2014 was shut down by billionaire owner Philip Anschutz late last year. Anschutz has remained invested, however, in the Washington Examiner, which has tilted in a pro-Trump direction.\n\nThe Weekly Standard and National Review were the two redoubts of the Never Trump movement and stand in stark contrast to most media and activist websites on the right. Places like Breitbart News, the Daily Caller, the Federalist, Newsmax and others have all generally acceded to the pro-Trump point of view.\n\nJonah Goldberg (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photo: William B. Plowman/NBC/NBC NewsWire via Getty Images) More\n\nGoldberg noted that, by and large, none of the many conservative sites \u2014 even those like Ben Shapiro\u2019s Daily Wire, which is often quite critical of Trump \u2014 do a lot of original journalism, preferring instead to traffic in opinion and analysis.\n\n\u201cWe think there is a large market out there for reporting from the right of center, and analysis ... that isn\u2019t water-carrying for the Republican Party, nor is it just trying to beat up the Republican Party,\u201d Goldberg said.\n\nMuch of Goldberg\u2019s thinking has been shaped of late by studying the ways that traditional political parties have atrophied over the last several decades, creating a vacuum that has been filled by other actors and redefining the meaning of what a party is.\n\nPolitical parties now are much more than a few committees and elected officials, he said. Political parties have become an ecosystem of interest groups, partisan media outlets and cable TV channels, big donors and dark money groups, and the traditional committee institutions and politicians.\n\n\u201cSince 1972, right before our eyes but almost invisibly, the infrastructure of both the professional right and the professional left have turned into essentially de facto proxies of the parties,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cWhen the parties stopped performing party functions, these other institutions starting doing it, whether it\u2019s Planned Parenthood on the left or the NRA on the right.\n\nGoldberg said the \u201cideological press\u201d has also become part of the new party ecosystem, but said that is \u201cnot always a bad thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving National Review because I\u2019m mad at National Review,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cNational Review vets candidates, it frames issues, it does all sorts of things that parties are supposed to do. Fox News plays a huge function in that. So does MSNBC. All those televised debates and town halls, those are essentially party functions that the party isn\u2019t doing anymore, or is at least cooperating with.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, he said, he and Hayes are setting out to create a news site that consciously rejects an alignment with the modern party apparatus.\n\n\u201cLots of media institutions have internalized this role as a sort of an arm of the party,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you get a lot of media players who, to the extent that they\u2019re reporting \u2026 a lot of it is basically in service to a partisan agenda. That\u2019s a lot of what Daily Caller has become \u2026 defending Trump.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller, in fact, was launched in 2009 with a similar mission to the one stated by Goldberg: to do in-depth journalism from a center-right point of view. But that vision was long ago eclipsed by an approach that relies on stoking partisan outrage, which is a lower-cost, higher-yield business venture, at least in the short term.
