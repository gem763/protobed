That move stayed a prior lower court decision, that ruled in favor of the Sierra Club and other plaintiffs, barring the administration from using the funds for the wall.\n\nTrump greeted Friday\u2019s ruling on Twitter, with a post reading: \u201cWow! Big VICTORY on the Wall. The United States Supreme Court overturns lower court injunction, allows Southern Border Wall to proceed. Big WIN for Border Security and the Rule of Law!\u201d\n\nThis means that construction on the wall can officially begin. But pending legal challenges from environmental groups will continue to move forward in lower courts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s border wall plan has long been a source of ire for environmental groups and scientists, many of whom say the wall will be ecologically devastating and have severe implications for wildlife and biodiversity, in addition to research. But organizations that have opposed the wall indicated they plan to continue fighting the effort.\n\n\u201cThis is not over,\u201d pledged Dror Ladin, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). That organization is working with the Sierra Club, which sued the government earlier this year over the wall\u2019s environmental implications, among others.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the destruction that the ever-expanding border wall has inflicted,\u201d said Sierra Club managing attorney Gloria Smith in a statement. Smith said that her organization \u201cwill continue to fight this wall and Trump\u2019s agenda through and through.\u201d\n\nFollowing the Friday ruling, however, groups acknowledged that the decision marks a major setback in efforts to fight the wall. But Ladin asserted that the legal battles will continue.\n\n\u201cWe will be asking the federal appeals court to expedite the ongoing appeals proceeding to halt the irreversible and imminent damage from Trump\u2019s border wall,\u201d he said, arguing that \u201cborder communities, the environment, and our Constitution\u2019s separation of powers will be permanently harmed\u201d if the project proceeds.\n\nAdvocates say the risks to border communities and the environment posed by the wall are wide-ranging. In 2018, the Trump administration waived 28 environmental and health protections to build the border wall in Texas, arguing that the importance of the project outweighed other concerns. But more than 2,500 scientists from 43 countries have warned that the wall will \u201cthreaten some of the continent\u2019s most biologically diverse regions,\u201d with severe implications for science as well as for many species.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne treasured butterfly sanctuary on the Texas border has also repeatedly warned that the animals it protects could be irreparably harmed by the wall. And in a comment submitted earlier this month to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) said that the Arizona-Mexico portion of the wall would threaten the San Pedro River, the last free-flowing river in the Southwest.\n\n\u201cThe construction of 63 miles of border walls in the locations proposed would cause severe and irreversible damage to the environment and harm the culture, commerce, and quality of life for communities and residents located near the project areas,\u201d the organization warned.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1158501825.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
