A Senate inquiry on the impact of law enforcement on press freedom is now underway.\n\nBasically, today\u2019s industry action has not cast the actions of the AFP in a good light, and Keneally appeared to take advantage of that fact.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think the events were that sparked the campaign?\u201d asked Keneally, after showcasing several blanked-out front pages to the new commissioner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an evidence-based police officer, so for me, I haven\u2019t even turned my mind to that,\u201d Kershaw said.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t turned your mind to the fact that every newspaper in the country looks like it\u2019s been redacted as a result of government secrecy?\u201d Keneally said, spurring Kershaw to say he planned to meet with editors to discuss their concerns.\n\nSenate Estimates- Had the AFP seen the #RightToKnow front pages? Had the new Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police seen the extraordinary front pages of today's newspapers? Journalists should never be prosecuted, or face going to jail, simply for doing their jobs.Unlike the Morrison Government, Labor believes in #pressfreedom and the public\u2019s #righttoknow. Posted by Kristina Keneally on Sunday, 20 October 2019\n\nFacing new Labor Senator Raff Ciccone, Kershaw said he didn\u2019t know if further raids were planned, but wouldn\u2019t rule anything out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019d obviously be having a look at, and we have to abide by some new guidelines, so that hasn\u2019t come to my attention as of yet,\u201d Kershaw said.\n\nThe issue has been addressed outside of the committee hearing, too. Taking to Twitter, Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said his party believes \u201cjournalists should not be prosecuted, or face going to jail, simply for doing their jobs.\u201d\n\nUnlike the Morrison Government, Labor believes in freedom of the press and the public\u2019s right to know. Labor believes journalists should not be prosecuted, or face going to jail, simply for doing their jobs. #righttoknow #PressFreedom https://t.co/ZtUbRILDEn \u2014 Mark Dreyfus (@markdreyfusQCMP) October 20, 2019\n\nAnd in a brief statement at Parliament House last night, Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese told Sky News \u201cjournalism is not a crime.\n\n\u201cThese three journalists were doing their job, letting the Australian public know what they have a right to know.\n\n\u201cAnd therefore, it is entirely inappropriate that there be charges against journalists for doing their jobs.\u201d\n\nGreens Senator Nick McKim had harsh words for both Labor and the Coalition, arguing both had effectively \u201ccolluded\u201d to permit a legal environment where raids against journalists were possible.\n\nSecondly, Labor jumping aboard this bandwagon is deeply cynical given their complete acquiescence to the government on all \"national security\" issues. You colluded with the LNP to put these laws in place! \u2014 Nick McKim (@NickMcKim) October 21, 2019\n\nSo yes, press freedom is under attack and should be defended. But let's also not pretend that it is happening in a vacuum. The rights of all people are under attack and only through acting collectively, instead of protecting special interests, can we fight back. \u2014 Nick McKim (@NickMcKim) October 21, 2019\n\nNationals MP Barnaby Joyce was also critical, pointing to News Corp\u2019s reporting on his relationship with former staffer Vikki Campion as evidence it \u201ccuts both ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand your imperative of the public interest test, I really do. But you can\u2019t say putting a private individual, a pregnant woman crossing the street, on your front page is in the public interest,\u201d Joyce said.\n\nJoyce lashes out over press freedom campaign Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce has lashed out over a press freedom campaign, accusing the media of taking a hypocritical approach.
