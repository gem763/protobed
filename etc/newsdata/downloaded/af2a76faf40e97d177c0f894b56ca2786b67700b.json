I saw [the cake] and walked out of the room.\n\n\"It was a lop-sided mess - nothing like I thought it would be like.\n\n\"[Before yesterday], we'd heard nothing from her since. She had not called or anything.\n\n\"The only reason she gave a refund now was because of the viral post. She said she couldn't give me my money back at first because she had 50 hours in it and she had to pay her mom for helping.\"\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nShaming the cake on social media, Rena's sister-in-law Annette Hill wrote: \"The one 'peacock' looks like a turkey with leprosy or something, and the white bird, which isn't white at all, doesn't even have a tail or look like a bird in any way, it's just a brown BLOB!\n\n\"There's NOTHING supporting the 'birds' and the cake was already sinking so bad from their weight when it was delivered and it continued to sink worse overnight until the next morning, the day of the wedding, the birds were almost sitting on the bottom layer.\n\n\"So, on the morning of her wedding, the bride was going from store to store trying to find a cake that would be suitable to use for her wedding.\"\n\nAfter the baker dropped off the wedding cake, which was supposed to feature two green and purple peacocks, one of the birds' heads reportedly fell off onto Rena's floor.\n\nRena asked for a refund but claims she was immediately refused, so the baker returned 'with a box of Rice Krispies' to try and rebuild the animal.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nThe cake maker even claimed the fondant icing 'kept getting bubbles in it'.\n\nRena said: \"[The baker] had made a cake for my best friend one time. Since then, she had supposedly finished baking school in town.\n\n\"First off we sent her a picture via text and she said she could make the cake.\n\n\"I called her and we agreed she would make the cake in a heart shape, and instead of one peacock she would make two.\n\n\"She came the night before the wedding. She set it up on the table and all the time, I'm looking at this cake, thinking 'really, are you serious?'\n\n\"I just walked out of the room. I had nothing else to say to her.\n\n\"Five minutes after she'd left, one of the peacocks' heads had fallen off. I text her and asked for my money back, but she said she'd think what she could do.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\"The next few minutes she shows up at my house with a box of Rice Krispies. The peacocks were supposed to be fondant too, but I don't know what she had on them.\n\n\"When she came back so tried to fix the white bird's head.\n\n\"She went outside to tell my husband that she had worked 50 hours on that cake, that she'd taken time off her job.\n\n\"It looked like it'd been thrown together the night before. All I asked her was to please give me my money back.\n\n\"I text her when she left to say the cake was not how it was supposed to be. It wasn't fondant, it was buttercream, and it wasn't the colours I wanted.\n\n\"She said 'well, I couldn't get the fondant to do right - it kept getting bubbles in it'.\n\n\"I thought, well at least call me? Never once did I get a call. Everything was always going according to plan and she maintained it'd be there the night before the wedding.\"\n\nRena was so upset by the cake, she texted to ask the cake maker to collect it, but she refused.\n\nThe cake remained in her fridge for three days until after the wedding, when she threw it in the bin.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nRena said: \"The cake sat here for three days and she didn't come and get it.\n\n\"When Dennis took the cake out and my grandson held the bin liner out, it hit the floor like a brick. It was so heavy - there was no way anybody could have eaten that cake.\n\n\"I didn't even taste it. I was too angry. I didn't want anything to do with it.\n\n\"I was forced to call around on the morning of my wedding. No one had any cakes they could fix for me.\n\n\"I went to Walmart and got two cakes. One had purple and green flowers on it, so I got that one, then a triple chocolate one and put a tractor on it.\n\n\"On the white cake, I got some love hearts from Hobby Lobby.\n\n\"If she had called me when the fondant wasn't acting right, I would have had time to get a new cake.\n\n\"Overall, after I went and got the cake and that taken care of, the day was really good.\"", "description": "The peacock-themed wedding cake looked nothing like the design she'd dreamt of, and left her 'heartbroken' before the big day", "authors": ["Sophie Norris", "Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Kennedy News", "Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20548172.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Kennedy-News-and-Media.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
