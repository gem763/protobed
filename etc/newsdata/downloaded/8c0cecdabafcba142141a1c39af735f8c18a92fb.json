They concluded that globally and in the United States, its impact is around 1% to GDP.\n\nWith U.S. GDP estimated at about $20 trillion, and world GDP at about $85 trillion, a 1% impact would put the drag from trade uncertainty at about $200 billion to U.S. GDP, and $850 billion to global GDP, according to Reuters calculations.\n\nThe estimates, the researchers said, are uncertain.\n\nBut they are notable in that they are among the first to quantify the large impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s approach to trade deals, which he says put the U.S. economy at a global disadvantage.\n\nIn an effort to win better trade terms, the Trump administration has jacked up tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese imports and imposed or threatened to impose duties on imports from other trading partners, including Mexico and the European Union. China and other countries in turn have threatened or imposed their own tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Federal Reserve Board building on Constitution Avenue is pictured in Washington, U.S., March 19, 2019.

But they have consistently called out the tariffs as detrimental to U.S. growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month cited trade policy uncertainty as an important reason for the global economic slowdown and weak U.S. manufacturing.\n\nChicago Fed President Charles Evans on Wednesday argued that increased trade tensions could slow U.S. potential growth to 1.5% a year, half what Trump said his administration would deliver.", "description": "Trade policy uncertainty driven by the Trump administration's escalating dispute with China means hundreds of billions of dollars in lost U.S. output and as much as $850 billion lost globally through early next year, research published this week by the Federal Reserve suggests.", "authors": ["Ann Saphir", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426788240&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF841W5", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
