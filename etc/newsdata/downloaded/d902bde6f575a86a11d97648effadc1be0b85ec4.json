The attack was carried out by Iran-backed Houthi rebels and disrupted roughly five percent of the world's oil supply.\n\nAccording to Pompeo, Iran is solely to blame for this attack and other nations around the world need to condemn what took place.\n\nTehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while Rouhani and Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy. Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply. There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen. \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) September 14, 2019\n\nWe call on all nations to publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran\u2019s attacks. The United States will work with our partners and allies to ensure that energy markets remain well supplied and Iran is held accountable for its aggression \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) September 14, 2019\n\nThe White House condemned the attacks and said the United States is prepared to help stabilize the world's oil market.\n\n\u201cViolent actions against civilian areas and infrastructure vital to the global economy only deepen conflict and mistrust. The United States Government is monitoring the situation and remains committed to ensuring global oil markets are stable and well supplied,\u201d the White House said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nSenators on both sides of the aisle weighed in on the attack.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said Iran needs to be held responsible for the attacks.\n\nIranian supported Houthi rebels who attacked Saudi oil refineries is yet another example of how Iran is wreaking havoc in the Middle East. The Iranian regime is not interested in peace - they\u2019re pursuing nuclear weapons and regional dominance. https://t.co/RElvTDFYb2 \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 14, 2019\n\nIt is now time for the U.S. to put on the table an attack on Iranian oil refineries if they continue their provocations or increase nuclear enrichment. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 14, 2019\n\nIran will not stop their misbehavior until the consequences become more real, like attacking their refineries, which will break the regime\u2019s back. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 14, 2019\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) disagreed with Pompeo's assessment of the situation.", "description": ".09/14/2019 19:57:28PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/169/49d3af8c-7366-4dcb-9418-7fc5dc0998d6.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
