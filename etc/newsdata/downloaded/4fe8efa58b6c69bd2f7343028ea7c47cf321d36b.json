Gnosticplayers was at the centre of a major hack earlier this year that exposed data for nearly one billion online accounts.\n\nZygna did not confirm how many users were impacted by the hack or what information may have been revealed, but did say that an investigation is underway. The company says it doesn't store Facebook, Android or iOS passwords, so that information was not included in the database. Zygna is offering additional support for players who are concerned about their data.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.", "description": "A hacker claims he accessed data from more than 200 million people who played \"Words with Friends\" on iPhone and Android.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9423/97ae7ebec4f04f24a9f20d679629fa44.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
