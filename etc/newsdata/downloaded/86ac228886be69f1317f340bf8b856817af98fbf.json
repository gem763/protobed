The U. Parliament forced Johnson to ask for a delay to avoid a no-deal Brexit, which would hurt the economies of both Britain and the EU.\n\nIn a letter to Tusk, Johnson said that under UK law \"I have no discretion . to do anything other than confirm the UK's formal agreement to this extension.\"\n\nBut he called the delay \"unwanted\" and said it was \"imposed on this government against its will.\"\n\nJohnson urged the 27 other EU countries \"to make clear that a further extension after 31 January is not possible.\"\n\nJohnson took office in July vowing to \"get Brexit done\" after his predecessor, Theresa May, resigned in defeat. Parliament had rejected her divorce deal with the bloc three times, and the EU had delayed Britain's scheduled March 29 departure, first to April, and then to October.\n\nJohnson has faced similar political gridlock, as Parliament blocked his attempt to push through his Brexit deal before the October deadline and made him ask the EU for more time.\n\nJohnson hopes voters will give his Conservative Party a majority if there is an election, so that he can push through the divorce deal he struck with the EU and \u2014 finally \u2014 take Britain out of the bloc.\n\nOpposition parties also want an election, though not on Johnson's terms.\n\nKirsty Blackman of the Scottish National Party said her party favored a slightly earlier Dec 9 vote and \"we will not be dancing to Boris Johnson's tune on this.\"\n\nThe main opposition Labour Party said it would study the government's bill before deciding whether to back it.\n\n\"We look forward to a clear, definitive decision that no deal is absolutely off the table and there is no danger of this prime minister not sticking to his word,\" said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nThere's also a strong chance an election could produce a Parliament as divided over Brexit as the current one. All the political parties are worried about a backlash from grumpy voters asked to go to the polls at the darkest, coldest time of the year. Britain has not had a December election in almost a century.\n\nEuropean officials, meanwhile, urged Britain not to waste the extra Brexit time.\n\nGerman government spokesman Steffen Seibert welcomed the Brexit delay, but cautioned Britain to \"use the additional time productively.\"\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, head of the European Parliament's Brexit group, wrote on Twitter that whatever Britain ultimately decides to do, \"the uncertainty of Brexit has gone on for far too long.\"\n\n\"This extra time must deliver a way forward.\"\n\nFrance had resisted another extension to Brexit, but European Affairs Minister Amelie de Montchalin said the prospect of a new election in Britain justified the new delay. Montchalin also said it was not too late for Britain to revoke Article 50 of the EU treaty and cancel Brexit, something that Johnson has vowed he will never do.\n\n\"The prime minister can pick up his phone and call Brussels to say: 'I stop everything,'\" she said.\n\nSamuel Petrequin reported from Brussels.
