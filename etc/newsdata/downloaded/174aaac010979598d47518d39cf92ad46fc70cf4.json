I gained a lot of weight in this last pregnancy. I am in my 40s and had a hard time with my pregnancy emotionally.\n\nMy husband dismissed all of my concerns. He basically said to get over it. I think I have some postpartum depression now, but he said it's been a year and I need to get over that, too.\n\nI am overall healthy but need to lose some more weight and get my cholesterol in check. My husband has spent this past year training for a half-Ironman competition. I work full time, and I am the one who basically takes care of the kids. He works full time, too, and does coach the kids' soccer teams but uses this as a way to work out, as well.\n\nI just find him to be so incredibly selfish. I am desperately trying to lose this baby weight \u2014 I have 10 more to go and then another 15 to get back to my old size \u2014 and get healthy per doctor's orders. He will leave early in the morning to exercise, and I have no idea when he is coming back. I am often left to make camp/school lunches, get kids ready, etc. He will sometimes take them in the mornings if he is back in time. It is the same on weekends.\n\nI just want to do a 25-minute exercise tape but he says I should be doing that while I have a babysitter. We have a babysitter for when I am at work. I need that time to commute to my office and actually work. I am also still pumping twice a day, so time is stretched. I often have to work at night after kids are asleep, and, quite frankly, I don't love working out at night. My job is incredibly stressful, as well.\n\nDo you have any suggestions? How can I stop crying all the time or getting so upset and angry because I am so frustrated with him? He isn't going to change, so I need to change myself. How can I change myself to stop having this deep resentment toward him? I welcome any tips.\n\n\u2014 Frustrated\n\nFrustrated: Well, wait a second. It sounds like his you-need-to-get-over-it-ism has wormed its way into your soul.\n\n\u201cHow can I change myself to stop having this deep resentment?\u201d Wha?\n\nThat\u2019s, just, no.\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nI get \u2014 and have long helped to preach \u2014 the whole you-can\u2019t-make-other-people-change gospel. But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re stuck and your only choice is to brainwash yourself into believing a crap sandwich is caviar.\n\nWhat our inability to change others means is that we\u2019re all choosing from a set of options limited to what we control \u2014 but they are options nonetheless.\n\nYou can, for example, please, give yourself the love, care, support and respect your husband has failed to. Talk to your doctor, find a compassionate therapist, take your postpartum symptoms seriously because they are serious stuff.\n\nYou can also state your case plainly to your husband: \u201cYou leave to train every morning while I do all the kid stuff, and you won\u2019t cover me for a 25-minute video? To treat two legitimate health issues? That\u2019s just wrong.\u201d If his MO is to dismiss your feelings, then make him dismiss your facts.\n\nLikewise, you can also take general note of the hours he trains per week while you care for the kids; ask him for generally equal time per week to tend to your needs; believe in your right to have that; stand your ground.\n\nYou can stop saying you have a sitter for when \u201cI am\u201d at work and make that an unflinching \u201cwe are.\u201d\n\nYou can wean, if you\u2019re ready.\n\nYou can reach out to people you trust to care about you. Family, friends, mere acquaintances, strangers even, fellow parents \u2014 you\u2019ll recognize the good ones. They\u2019re the people who hear you\u2019re an over-40 third-time new mom who is torn up over 25 pounds and will say to you, \u201cHey, hey. You\u2019re taking care of the world. Be patient with yourself.\u201d\n\nYou can stop weighing your worth on a scale.\n\nYou can look into your finances and career prospects and rethink this stressful job.\n\nYou can talk to an attorney.\n\nYou have agency. Use it.\n\nI realize you\u2019re burning all your fuel just to get through the days, but even if you have to take a workday off while the babysitter is on, give yourself a break and a really good think, and open yourself to the possibility of real change on your terms. Here, there, on the margins, at the heart of everything, wherever it needs to be.\n\nThe universe is going to say no to some of the things you want from life; that doesn\u2019t mean you should race it to be first to deny yourself all but your barest needs.", "description": "His response to her postpartum struggles is to get over it.
