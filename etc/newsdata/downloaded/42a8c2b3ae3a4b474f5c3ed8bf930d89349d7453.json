New York's outflows to the Sunshine State were the highest \u2013 63,772 people. New York had the third-largest outflows of any state, with 452,580 people moving out within the past year.\n\nBut just how much lower are taxes in Florida?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndividuals earning $650,000 can save more than $69,700 in taxes per year by moving from New York to the Sunshine State.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the differences between the state\u2019s tax structures:\n\nIncome taxes\n\nPerhaps the most well-known tax benefit of moving to Florida is that residents are not subject to a statewide income tax. That means they only have to pay federal rates.\n\nThe state tax rates in New York, on the other hand, range from 4 percent to 8.82 percent.\n\nDeath taxes\n\nNew York has an estate tax, which means that when a resident dies, property located in the state will be subject to both the federal and state rates.\n\nEstate tax rates in New York range from 3.06 percent to 16 percent. The exclusion amount is $5.74 million.\n\nFlorida has no estate tax of its own, meaning assets are only subject to the federal tax.\n\nNeither Florida nor New York have an inheritance tax, but residents who inherit out-of-state property may still owe taxes to another state.\n\nReal estate property taxes\n\nThe effective real estate property tax rate in Florida is 0.98 percent, according to data from WalletHub.\n\nThat compares with 1.68 percent in New York.\n\nTherefore, a Florida resident paying real estate property taxes on a $194,000 home would owe $1,897. A person in New York with a home valued at the same amount would owe $3,246.\n\nSales taxes\n\nWhen it comes to total state sales and excise taxes, there isn\u2019t much of an advantage for those living in Florida. In fact, the rate in New York is actually lower.\n\nHowever, when additional local sales tax rates are taken into account, total rates can reach nearly 9 percent in New York (including New York City). That brings the top total rates nearly even in both places.\n\nOverall tax burden\n\nIn a ranking of states with the highest overall tax burden \u2013 taking into account property taxes, individual income taxes and total sales and excise taxes \u2013 New York ranked the highest (12.97 percent overall burden).\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nOn the flipside, Florida ranked 47, with an overall estimated tax burden of 6.56 percent.", "description": "What's driving the tax exodus to Florida?", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/cost-of-living-florida.png?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-08-29"}
