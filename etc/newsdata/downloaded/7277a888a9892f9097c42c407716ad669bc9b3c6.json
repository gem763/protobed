Last week, Italy allowed an NGO rescue vessel to dock in Lampedusa, following a deal to relocate refugees among EU countries.\n\nEurope can\u2019t expect Italy to do all the heavy lifting \u2014 or expect that a change of heart in Rome will be enough to solve the Continent\u2019s migration challenge.\n\nSalvini\u2019s approach \u2014 blocking ports, cracking down on NGOs conducting search-and-rescue operations and picking fights with EU neighbors \u2014 was misguided and antagonistic, but one thing is clear: It was a mirror reflection of the public sentiment that Italy had been left to deal with the issue alone.\n\nThe only way to manage migration more effectively is to breathe new life into the EU\u2019s long-stalled efforts to revamp migration policy. And the only way to do that is to provide long- overdue support to the countries on the bloc\u2019s borders, including Italy, that have been left to deal with the bulk of migrant and refugee arrivals.\n\nEurope can\u2019t expect Italy to do all the heavy lifting \u2014 or expect that a change of heart in Rome will be enough to solve the Continent\u2019s migration challenge.\n\nTo be sure, there\u2019s plenty more Italy can do.\n\nFirst and foremost, it should re-open its ports to NGO vessels and scrap the former interior minister\u2019s infamous \u201csecurity decrees,\u201d which criminalize NGOs active in the Mediterranean. The policy exposes already traumatized people to prolonged and unnecessary suffering, and contravenes international law.\n\nThe new government should also endorse the Global Compact on Migration, a non-binding international agreement that helps U.N. member states cooperate on migration and uphold the dignity and fundamental rights of all migrants and refugees. After the previous government shied away from joining the agreement, Italy has an opportunity to demonstrate it is committed to being an international player and a European leader on migration.\n\nBut Italy can\u2019t be left to act on its own. Rome has made a step toward the EU \u2014 and Brussels has to reciprocate.\n\nEuropean leaders would do well to remember that the Italian government is under strong pressure to deliver immediate results on migration. It needs to demonstrate to its voters that Italy\u2019s interests are better protected under the new coalition than an anti-immigration firebrand like Salvini.\n\nThere are three immediate steps that would benefit both sides \u2014 and require them both to take a step toward the other.\n\nIt\u2019s important that the new government be able to demonstrate that a collaborative approach is more effective than confrontation, in attracting support from Italy\u2019s neighbors and allies.\n\nThe political upheaval in Rome opens a window of opportunity for the EU. The bloc\u2019s \u201cemergency mode\u201d approach and its attempts to come up with short-term solutions has clearly failed. With a progressive government in Italy, Brussels has a chance to finally address the gaps in the EU\u2019s own migration system.\n\nThere are three immediate steps that would benefit both sides \u2014 and require them both to take a step toward the other.\n\nFirst, at the informal meeting of interior ministers later this month, Italy and its EU partners should establish a predictable disembarkation system that safeguards the rights of people rescued at sea. In return for commitments of European solidarity, Italy would pledge to abandon its \u201cclosed ports\u201d policy.\n\nSecond, search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean should be reinstated. Italy\u2019s softer stance on migration and the recent renewal of Operation Sophia\u2019s mandate send a positive signal. But people at risk of drowning cannot wait \u2014 EU governments need to swiftly reinstate the operation\u2019s naval assets and extend its mission to search-and-rescue operations.\n\nFinally, in the course of the next few months, the European Parliament and Commission should revive stalled negotiations around the Common European Asylum System, starting with a swift agreement on an EU-wide resettlement framework guaranteeing a fair distribution of migrants and refugees among willing countries.\n\nThere are three immediate steps that would benefit both sides \u2014 and require them both to take a step toward the other.\n\nThese short-term fixes need not wait for the essential but more difficult discussion around how to more effectively manage migration to Europe in the long term.\n\nMigration is not an issue that the EU can ignore. The number of new arrivals may be down, with the number of people reaching European shores back to pre-2015 levels, but the drivers of forced displacement \u2014 including climate change, conflict and poverty \u2014 are only becoming more powerful. Managed right, this need not be a crisis for the bloc.\n\nWhether or not Italy leaves the Salvini era behind will largely depend on the ability of European leaders to demonstrate a real commitment to finding common ground on migration around Europe\u2019s core values. Leaving countries like Italy alone to deal with migration only aggravates the situation. Facing that fact would be a good start to tackling the challenge.\n\nImogen Sudbery is director of policy and advocacy for Europe at the International Rescue Committee.", "description": "If Brussels wants to fix flawed migration policy, it has to stand by Rome.", "authors": ["Imogen Sudbery"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167226094-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
