Tulsi Gabbard, a veteran long known for her controversial positions on foreign policy, clashed with fellow Democrats during Tuesday night\u2019s fourth Democratic debate, and called on Sen. Elizabeth Warren to join her in condemning what she called a \u201cregime change\u201d war in Syria.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s sudden decision last Sunday to withdraw troops from northeastern Syria paved the way for a Turkish invasion, and has been widely criticized for abandoning the Kurdish allies who fought alongside U.S. forces against the Islamic State.\n\nWhile conceding that President Trump \u201chas the blood of the Kurds on his hands,\u201d Gabbard also blamed \u201cmany of the politicians in this country\u201d as well as many in the media \u201cwho have supported this regime change war.\u201d She did not elaborate on specific Democratic policies of support for regime change, and former Vice President Joe Biden said that regime change \u201chas not been the policy.\u201d\n\nYet Gabbard was mostly alone in appearing to support the sudden withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region, even from candidates like Warren, who have expressed concern about U.S. military intervention abroad. Sen. Warren agreed that the U.S. should \u201cget out of the Middle East\u201d but argued that an abrupt departure is not the way to do it. \u201cWe have to do it the right way,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIn Syria, [Trump] has created a bigger-than-ever humanitarian crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to get out of this but we need to do it through a negotiated solution, there is no military solution.\u201d\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg, a former military officer who served in the Middle East, directly challenged Gabbard\u2019s conclusions. \u201cI think that is dead wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThe slaughter going on in Syria ... it\u2019s a consequence of withdrawal and betrayal by this president.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that a small group of Special Forces operators supported by intelligence officers are the only thing standing between \u201cgenocide and a resurgence of ISIS.\u201d He said that Trump, by pulling troops out of Syria, \u201cis taking away what makes America, America.\u201d\n\nGabbard asked Buttigieg whether he supported \u201chaving U.S. troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time.\u201d Buttigieg responded that it\u2019s possible to \u201cput an end to endless war without embracing Trump\u2019s policy,\u201d though he did not elaborate on a specific plan to withdraw troops from Syria over time.\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard (Photo: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters) More\n\nLast Sunday evening, the White House quietly announced the United States would be withdrawing from northern Syria, making way for a Turkish invasion. The move effectively abandoned Kurdish allies in the region, and risked setting loose thousands of Islamic State prisoners.\n\nThe announcement quickly drew international and domestic outrage, including from blindsided European allies who warned of an imminent humanitarian crisis. Even U.S. Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell, a staunch Trump ally, told reporters he was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the U.S. response to the ongoing Syrian civil war as well as the decision to expose Syrian Kurds to an imminent Turkish offensive.\n\nTrump took to Twitter to defend his decision Monday morning, arguing that the U.S. \u201cwas supposed to be in Syria for 30 days\u201d and that it was time to let stakeholders in the region, including \u201cTurkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia, and the Kurds,\u201d to \u201cfigure the situation out.\u201d\n\nHe threatened to destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if its military did \u201canything off limits.\u201d But just days after Trump\u2019s announcement, Turkish air and land forces initiated the country\u2019s latest military operations in Syria, dubbed \u201cOperation Peace Spring,\u201d including launching airstrikes on Syrian border towns.\n\nTurkey has announced a plan to create a 32-kilometer \u201csafe zone\u201d in the border region for 1 million Syrian refugees, a strategy Human Rights Watch\u2019s director of crisis and conflict division, Lama Fakih, called \u201cwoefully misguided and dangerous \u2014 and bound to fail\u201d because of the potential for increased displacement and danger for civilians.", "description": "Yet Gabbard was mostly alone in appearing to support the sudden withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region, even from candidates like Warren, who have expressed concern about U.S. military intervention abroad.", "authors": ["Jenna Mclaughlin", "National Security", "Investigations Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bP9oJHdiiLomo_.AwJT1Ng--~B/aD0yMzQ2O3c9MzYzNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/7a0651d0-efbe-11e9-bfed-1d5e2f12e173", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
