(Shutterstock/Melanie Marriott)\n\nThey came from international places as far away as Dublin and London, from Australian cities including Brisbane and Adelaide, as well as the Sunshine Coast.\n\nWhile the majority moved because they wanted to be in the country, some arrived because visa requirements meant they had to work in a rural place. Others came for their partner, to be nearer family or, in one case, for a career opportunity for themselves.\n\nThese circumstances weren\u2019t always entirely within their personal control.\n\nOnce they settled in, the majority found they were glad to be there. They enjoyed the level of trust people showed them, or the lack of traffic lights in town.\n\nOthers found the idyllic rural life wasn\u2019t all it\u2019s made out to be in media. For them, moving to the country meant limited leisure choices and life opportunities.\n\nHere\u2019s some of what they told me (not their real names).\n\nCity girls\n\nNatalie moved because she\u2019d been offered her dream job in Stanthorpe, but said she was \u201ca city girl at heart\u201d.\n\nBeing in a small country town was challenging for her. She found it really hard to meet people her age. She also mentioned how:\n\n[\u2026] when you\u2019re in a small town, there\u2019s no getting away from each other [\u2026] everybody knows what\u2019s going on in your life.\n\nShe loved her new job and appreciated the way people helped each other out, but she was always seen as an outsider. This was partly due to her accent and the type of clothes she wore, which others commented on.\n\nAfter several years in her job, she was offered an opportunity in Brisbane and took it, keen to get back to the city.\n\nChristine, a middle-aged woman who moved for her husband, said she was \u201cnot a country girl\u201d. While her home was \u201ca very pretty spot\u201d, she often journeyed back to Brisbane and Sydney for things she couldn\u2019t access locally.\n\nYou can\u2019t just make an appointment with a gynaecologist or an ophthalmologist, there are none. The major services aren\u2019t here [\u2026]\n\nBut she said she had a better social life now than she had previously because country people \u201cmake time [\u2026] it\u2019s a lovely community\u201d.\n\nCountry girls\n\nRae had mostly grown up in cities but enjoyed the outdoors as a child and had \u201calways been a country girl at heart\u201d.\n\nWe love it (Stanthorpe). It ticks all the boxes, big enough that you don\u2019t know everyone, but small enough that you know most people.\n\nAsked if the media show country life as it really is, she said:\n\nThose magazines seem far too glitzy for what I know as truth [\u2026] it\u2019s more muddy gumboots and bikes out the front of houses.\n\nLucy said of the magazines \u201cthey\u2019re selling the dream\u201d. Even though she tried, she couldn\u2019t quite replicate that dream in her own life.\n\nThe participants who accepted the disparity between media idyll and country reality seemed most content.\n\nKate said her country life was nothing like she envisaged it would be.\n\nBut that\u2019s good, because I can still enjoy reading books and watch McLeod\u2019s Daughters and keep them there as that fantasy of what I\u2019d like it to be in the country.", "description": "Moving to the country is presented as the idyllic way to escape the pressure of the city, but what is the reality for Australian women looking for to make the big move?...", "authors": ["Hayley Williams", "Claire Lower"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/l/2019/10/Country-gal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
