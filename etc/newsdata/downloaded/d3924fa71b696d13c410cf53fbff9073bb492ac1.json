He then sent a clear message to Ankara that the Damascus intends to regain all of its land.\n\nAssad made the surprise visit to the frontline on Tuesday. He met the troops west of the town of Khan Sheikhoun, recently liberated by the Syrian Arab Army.\n\nFootage from the scene shows the president inspecting military maps, as well as looking out with a spotting scope, presumably at the positions held by the militants.\n\nThe frontline tour came ahead of the talks between Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Sochi. During the exceptionally long meeting, the two leaders discussed the situation in Syria and signed a memorandum aimed at easing tensions in the Kurdish-controlled region in the north.\n\nWhile talks on northern Syria were ongoing in Moscow, Assad made sure there would be no misconceptions over his stance on the Turkish operation there.\n\n\u201cErdogan is a thief and is now stealing our land,\u201dAssad said, pledging to retake every last inch of the Syrian territory.\n\nSpeaking to Putin on the phone after the Sochi talks, the Syrian president welcomed the results of the talks, but said he will continue the fight terrorism \u201cby all legitimate means.\u201d He also stressed a \u201ccomplete refusal\u201d of any invasion into Syria, no matter the pretext, his office said in a statement.\n\nAnkara launched an incursion against Syrian Kurdish-led militias, which it considers to be terrorists, following Washington's decision to pull out the US troops stationed there. The Putin-Erdogan agreement on Tuesday effectively brought the Turkish \u2018Operation Peace Spring\u2019 to a halt. The Syrian army, supported by Russian military police, will now take control of a large part of the country\u2019s border with Turkey \u2013 a plan that Moscow said has received \u201cfull support\u201d of Damascus.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
