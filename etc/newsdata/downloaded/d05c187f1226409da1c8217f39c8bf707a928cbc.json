And so using data and customer analytics, we can become more precise on who we target with promotions and what offers we provide,\" Price said.\n\nMacy's, the largest U.S. department store chain, has closed more than 100 stores and cut thousands of jobs as mall traffic falls amid a shift in customer preference to shop online.\n\nThe company said it is also testing self checkout in stores and rolling out new modernized handheld devices for staff to improve efficiency.\n\nThe retailer also said it expects to drive about $100 million in additional working capital improvements.\n\nEarlier this year, Macy's said it would cut 100 senior management positions to reduce costs and improve profitability.
