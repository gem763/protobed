Ms Orme told the court she thought the payments were 'odd' but felt bullied by Farr and did not want to question her superior.\n\nMs Orme was made redundant in 2018 but BA clubs could not pay her redundancy because there was no money left in the account.\n\nFarr resigned in 2017 after phoning her other colleague Alison Hartigan from Barbados and tearfully admitting giving money to her Nigerian boyfriend.\n\nIn February 2018, Detective constable Luke Simms went to Farr's home in Maidenhead, Berkshire, after she claimed she had been made the victim of a scam and sent \u00a365,000 of her own money to Jacob in Nigeria.\n\nMr Ojakovoh said: 'She said the company had told her not to report it. Arrangements were made for her to attend a voluntary interview in the presence of a solicitor. She reported meeting Jacob Adele in May 2017.\n\nAccountant Lisa Cowap was brought to investigate and identified 1,464 personal transactions starting a month after Farr joined the company, going back more than five years.\n\nMs Cowap said Farr had the letters 'ICMA' in her email title claiming she was an accountant, and forged the director's signature in a letter to Companies House.\n\nFarr was found to have defrauded BA clubs out of \u00a31,040,000 over a period of five years.\n\nFarr admitted plundering BA Clubs and using the money to pay for flights, lavish holidays and hotel stays\n\nThe 52-year-old resigned in 2017 after phoning a colleague from Barbados (pictured) and tearfully admitting giving money to her Nigerian boyfriend\n\nWhen interviewed in October 2018, Farr declined to comment on the fraudulent signature and details about the money taken from the company.\n\nConcluding the prosecution's case, Mr Ojakovoh revealed Farr's relevant two previous convictions for six offences.\n\nHe said: 'Between November 2008 and January 2009 she abused her position of trust as a manager, writing company cheques in her partner's name of just under \u00a310,000 which were cashed. She received a community order for this.\n\n'In 1984 she was given a conditional discharge after admitting theft by an employee with 16 offences taken into consideration.'\n\nFarr admitted three counts of fraud by false representation.\n\nAs he jailed her, Judge Pau Dugdale said: 'You used money entrusted to you, on you and your own family and not just for surviving.\n\n'It went on a good life. You used money from BA Clubs to fund the high life.\n\n'BA Clubs is a social club for staff and family with 10,000 members and has been running since World War II. The trustees are not wealthy but ordinary working people who have contributed to the club so they could have a social life around work life.\n\n'During your time you sucked it of virtually every penny it had. You left it in a position it could no longer operate financially as a company.\n\n'It had to move premises, it could no longer afford the services to customers.\n\n'There may well be tragic circumstances with your sister but this does not qualify the way you spent. You have two previous convictions of similar fraud.'\n\nDefence counsel Francesca Anderson said Farr had been struggling emotionally and financially in the five years she had been spending the money.\n\nShe said: 'Her sister Sandra was diagnosed with cancer and given two years left to live and she wanted to do something positive with the short time they had together. She sadly lost all sense in using the company credit card.'\n\nFarr was sentenced to six years in jail but was not ordered to pay any costs because she had previously been declared bankrupt.\n\nAfter the sentencing, Ms Hartigan, now general manager of BA Clubs, said: 'As soon as [Farr] told me what happened, we reported it straight to the police.\n\n'We were a charity during the period of the fraud but we no longer have charity status. The benefit of being a charity no longer applied when we had to move premises, which we later realised was a result of the fraud.\n\n'Throughout her time at BA Clubs Carole Farr continued to report losses but the reports were fraudulent. Carole and I were friends but I have not spoken to her since this came to light. The organisation now employees only four staff.'\n\nMs Hartigan said all the BA Club employees were present at the sentencing.\n\n'I think justice has been done but it did take a long time. The maximum sentence for serious fraud is 10 years, knowing Carole will be out of prison in three years on licence is a bit disappointing,' she added.\n\n'I have no idea why nobody picked up on her previous convictions of fraud when she was hired, it was before my time at BA Clubs. There was absolutely no collusion, nobody knew what was going on.\n\n'It was an absolute shock to everybody. It is unbelievable what she managed to do.'", "description": "Carole Farr was jailed today at Reading Crown Court after she admitted plundering the exclusive BA Clubs and using the money to pay for business class flights, lavish holidays and hotel stays.", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/14/20132634-0-image-a-2_1571923195670.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
