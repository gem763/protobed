This doesn\u2019t quite feel like Hampden Park 1999, or Old Trafford 2001. There is, however, a bit of late 80s vibe \u2013 and not in an entirely positive way.\n\nTournament qualification, after all, is what victory in Prague on Friday will bring. The fact the Czech Republic are currently so underwhelming, England are so good, and Euro 2020 qualification has long been seen as a matter of course, however, has put more focus on unsavoury issues sadly seen as a similar matter of course.\n\nThis is a fixture that authorities \u2013 both within the FA and the Czech Republic \u2013 have long worried about. Given English supporters\u2019 recent history of unrest, a famous stag-party venue on a Friday night is a recipe for trouble. Duly, this is expected to see the biggest travelling contingent for years, with up to 5,000 coming.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It is the prospect of racial abuse towards England\u2019s black players, for the second leg of this trip away to Bulgaria.\n\nBulgarian supporters were found guilty of racist behaviour in the matches against Kosovo and the Czech Republic in June, which will see 5,000 seats blocked off at the Vasil Levski National Stadium, and has pretty much dominated the build-up to these games. It has already provoked a lot of questions, and a public dispute. With Tammy Abraham having said he would be wiling to go against Uefa\u2019s three-step protocol on how to handle racist chanting by walking off the pitch, Boislav Mikhaylov \u2013 the Bulgarian Football Union president and USA 94 hero \u2013 argued such discussions were \u201cderogatory\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

And that is very much the mood in the build-up to the weekend, in all of these issues. A sense of apprehension usually reserved for big games on the pitch.\n\nThe fact that England have already put nine goals past Czech Republic and Bulgaria, however, is one reason why everything else feels amped up. There just isn\u2019t the same meaning to the actual games.\n\nEven if they don\u2019t prove to be foregone conclusions, qualification is. If England don\u2019t qualify this weekend, they will eventually. They have too good a points base, although Gareth Southgate obviously won\u2019t let his players think along those lines.\n\nGiven that, and the squad\u2019s form, another statement display is likely. They should be aiming for a 100% record in this group. This is the state of the Czech team right now. This is the strength of England. Even there, though, Southgate\u2019s opportunity to experiment has been curtailed by the illness to James Maddison.\n\nHis potential inclusion \u2013 and what would have been a first cap \u2013 offered the main selection intrigue to this game. As it is, we\u2019re likely to see a similar midfield to usual, and it is highly unlikely that Harry Kane will be replaced by Tammy Abraham in the starting line-up \u2013 regardless of their finishing form right now.\n\nEven the question over whether Jadon Sancho will be picked over Marcus Rashford seems less important, because of the drastic difference in form between the two. It is thereby a weekend that is unlikely to provoke too many discussions on the pitch. Off it, however, could be a different matter.\n\nThat is where the real tension is, even as England face up to another qualification.", "description": "It is a potentially huge weekend for England, although not in the way tournament qualification used to be.
