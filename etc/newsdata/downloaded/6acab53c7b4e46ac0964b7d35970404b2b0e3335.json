Major suburbs within the area include Botany, Marrickville, Sydenham and Petersham.\n\nSydney's inner west, which includes Canada Bay, Leichhhardt, Strathfield, Burwood and Ashfield, is also set for a strong rebound with house prices forecast to rise by 11.80 per cent following a drop of 8.1 per cent in 2018.\n\nWestern Sydney's Blacktown area including Eastern Creek and Mount Druitt are on track to see a growth spurt in 2020 with house prices rising by 10.9 per cent.\n\nSydney-based buyer's agent Victor Kumar of Right Property Group said Blacktown's transformation into a major commercial and employment hub as well as its proximity to the new Badgerys Creek Airport will drive robust growth in the area.\n\n\"The flow on effect from the Badgery's Creek Airport is having a positive impact on people's confidence in the area,\" said Mr Kumar.\n\n\"There's a lot of work happening there right now and people are starting to notice the infrastructure.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Blacktown Council's pro-development stance is also attracting a large number of businesses in the area.\n\nHouse prices in Blacktown area are set to jump by 10.9 per cent in 2020 according to Moody's Analytics.\n\n\"A lot for businesses are moving into the Blacktown area because of the ease of getting the development approval. We're seeing a lot of new residential and industrial, warehouse-type developments springing up,\" he said.\n\nAlso tipped to outperform the Greater Sydney market are Baulkham Hills and Hawkesbury in Sydney's Northwest where house prices are set to jump by 11.1 per cent next year following a 7.7 per cent slump in 2018.\n\nDouglas Driscol, chief executive officer of real estate agency Starr Partners said the Hawkesbury area in particular was experiencing some of the best market conditions of all their Sydney offices.\n\n\"There's a reasonable level of listings and high level of demand for family homes,\" he said.\n\n\"I think the Hawkesbury area represents good value for money. It's within proximity to commercial and job centres in Western Sydney and has excellent transport links.\"\n\nMr Driscol noted that Baulkham Hills is going through urban regeneration so there's still room for prices to grow in the area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I think an 11 per cent growth is possible. I wouldn't be surprised if majority of Sydney suburbs grew by at least 10 per cent next year,\" he said.\n\n\"We're currently having a bit of a listings shortage which I think is creating an artificial pressure on prices at the moment. But there's a massive pent-up demand so I'm expecting quite a significant growth in greater Sydney over the next 12 months.\"\n\nIn sharp contrast, lifestyle regions like NSW's Southern Highlands and Shoalhaven are expected to see further drop in value in the year ahead.\n\nMoody's analysts are predicting a 3.2 per cent fall in house values in the region after a 2.1 per cent rise in 2018.\n\nIn Victoria, the Hume region is forecast to slide by 6 per cent, while the Queensland outback are expected to suffer on the back of drought conditions with house values expected to plunge by 25 per cent.\n\nDespite lower mortgage rates, house values in greater Perth are expected to drop by 0.7 per cent next year led by Perth's north-east area.\n\nHouse prices in the major suburbs within the locality that includes Bayswater, Bassendean, Mundaring and Swan are forecast to drop by 2.9 per cent on average.", "description": "High-income suburbs in Sydney and Melbourne are among the areas tipped to rebound strongly, notching up at least 10 per cent growth on average in 2020 as recovery accelerates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5521%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/23f084495db66dd12985082f7d74e065c8e6763e", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
