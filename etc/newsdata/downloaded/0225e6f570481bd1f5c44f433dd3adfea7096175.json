Much of that land would be lower quality and therefore less productive, researchers said. Carbon-rich grassland would probably also be ploughed up as a result.\n\nThe findings suggest that without major changes in diet \u2013 such as a reduction in meat consumption - the world could not be fed exclusively through organic methods.\n\nDr Laurence Smith, lead researcher in the Cranfield University study, said: \u201cAlthough resource use can be improved under organic management, there is a need to consider the potential effect on land-use.\n\n\u201cUnder a 100 per cent organic scenario in England and Wales, a net-reduction in greenhouse gases would only be achievable if accompanied by a major increase in organic yields or widespread changes to national diets.\u201d\n\nThe researchers said reducing waste and eating less meat had huge potential to reduce overall emissions. They added there was unlikely to be one single way to achieve environmentally sustainable food production and each country should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nProfessor David Reay, chair of carbon management at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the research, said the findings were not surprising but added organic farming still had benefits for land use.\n\n\u201cWe face a fiendishly difficult balancing act between cutting emissions, producing enough food, and protecting biodiversity and the myriad other gifts the land provides,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOrganic food production methods have an important role in achieving this balance \u2013 you can use all the precision farming methods and fancy fertilisers you like, but if the pollinators are all killed by pesticides you\u2019re still in a heap of trouble.\n\n\u201cFood production in some areas must become much more efficient so as to free up land elsewhere for carbon sequestration.\n\n\u201cOur diets must change and cuts in food-related emissions at home must not come at the expense of greater emissions overseas. But as we plough the furrow to \u2018net zero\u2019 we cannot afford to be wearing carbon blinkers.\u201d", "description": "Organic farming\u00a0produces more carbon\u00a0emissions\u00a0than traditional methods because it takes up a significantly\u00a0greater amount of land, according to a study.
