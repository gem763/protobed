At a time when women were sharing their collective, painful testimony of abuse at the hands of men, a short story that read like a personal essay pinballed across the internet. Now that the frenzy has passed, a new literature is in the process of emerging and it is subtle and nuanced, reaching beyond relatability and identity, and offering no easy answers.\n\nIn nonfiction and memoir, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey\u2019s She Said tells how the Weinstein story first broke. Meanwhile, Know My Name by Chanel Miller, whose powerful victim impact statement opened with the line \u201cyou don\u2019t know me but you\u2019ve been inside me\u201d, foreshadowed the movement\u2019s birth. There\u2019s the essay collection Not That Bad: Dispatches from Rape Culture edited by Roxane Gay, and Lucia Osborne-Crowley\u2019s I Choose Elena, a masterful examination of trauma and finding solace in literature. In Things I Didn\u2019t Talk About When I Was a Girl the author Jeannie Vanasco interviews her rapist about what he did to her when at a party when they were 19, and she thought, close friends. Fiction has offered readers a plurality of responses to #MeToo, from the speculative (Sophie Mackintosh\u2019s The Water Cure, Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Testaments) to the contemporary (Queenie, by Candice Carty-Williams, What Red Was by Rosie Thomas, Shelf Life by Livia Franchini) and the experimental (Peach by Emma Glass).\n\nPublishing loves a trend, and I\u2019ll admit to a feeling of queasiness when a proof came through my door along with a blurb proclaiming it \u201cthe first post-Weinstein novel\u201d. The press release for Gaitskill\u2019s This Is Pleasure, which is to be published in standalone book form next month, bills it as \u201cA masterful fictional contribution to the MeToo debate. Set to be the most fiercely debated book of the season.\u201d Are we witnessing so much pain being reduced to a marketing category, or is #MeToo a useful prism through which to view the work of these writers?\n\nSo many men have tried and failed to pigeonhole #MeToo, to lambast it as a disproportionate retaliation, a hysterical movement that is more of a danger to men\u2019s lives than their abuse is to women\u2019s. And yet this characterisation has failed. As the literary critic Parul Sehgal put it, fictional responses to it have been \u201cremarkably various, and they trouble debates that traffic in certainties. They come laden with confusion, doubt, subtlety \u2013 is it excessively earnest to call it truth?\u201d\n\nLike much of this new literature, This Is Pleasure does not shy away from the knotty problems of power and gender relations. It is told in the voice of Quin \u2013 a pervy literary editor who is brought down by a slew of accusations from young women \u2013 and Margot, his friend of more than 20 years, who feels conflicted and ambivalent about their relationship, and his downfall. Margot says: \u201cI was angry at him, too. But did he deserve to lose his job, his right to work, his honor as a human? Did he have to be so completely and utterly crushed? \u2026 But there are other things I don\u2019t say, can\u2019t say. And this is where the heart pain comes.\u201d\n\nAs Gaitskill has said, fiction is an ideal medium in which to explore such complicated feelings. She\u2019s been interrogating the grey areas of sexual power relations for decades, since her 1988 debut collection Bad Behavior. In one of those stories, Secretary, a young woman who was spanked by her boss is telephoned by a newspaper reporter because, in a pleasingly ironic twist-that-isn\u2019t, the man who did this to her is running for mayor. She hangs up on the reporter. In 2019, perhaps this character would feel able to tell her story, but that doesn\u2019t mean her feelings would be any less mixed. There are no doubt those who will find This Is Pleasure an exoneration, maybe even a betrayal. In this political moment older and younger women have, after all, butted heads. But these conversations are useful. The only thing that worries me is, where are the men?\n\nFor a while it looked at those male literary contributions to #MeToo would consist of self-pitying essays of exile, such as those of the US journalist John Hockenberry , in Harper\u2019s Magazine, and the former Canadian radio star Jian Ghomeshi in the New York Review of Books; works that painted them as complicated, tortured figures while erasing the pain of the women that they had hurt. Like Gaitskill\u2019s Quin, these men are granted complexity. We are expected to accept their subjectivity, even feel sorry for them. But to what extent are these men thinking of women at all?\n\nWe know that men read fewer books by women\n\nWe know that men read fewer books by women. It\u2019s all very well there being a rich and diverse literary response to #MeToo, but if men don\u2019t engage with it, what will change?\n\nIt is gratifying to see Gaitskill refuse to \u201cstay in her lane\u201d, and write a male character. And then there is Ben Lerner, who, in The Topeka School, has written an examination of toxic masculinity partly narrated by a female character so convincing that I had to remind myself it wasn\u2019t real. In a recent essay, Zadie Smith reminded us of fiction\u2019s role in helping us to inhabit the consciousnesses of people who are not like us. \u201cAll storytelling is the invitation to enter a parallel space, a hypothetical arena, in which you have imagined access to whatever is not you,\u201d she wrote, suggesting \u201cprofound-other-fascination\u201d as an alternative to the term \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d.\n\nWill men be accused of appropriating the literature of #MeToo? No doubt. But I hope to see more work like Lerner\u2019s. It shows, as Gaitskill\u2019s does, that truth perhaps exists most potently in the grey areas.\n\n\u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist", "description": "There has been a flowering of writing on the knotty problems of power and gender relations \u2013 but men must read it too, says Guardian columnist Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett", "authors": ["Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2366bc43f5690591dc9faa60fa69ecb2cb34def/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=34f10e7d36f93f9b34a349cc6bbabb50", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
