Yet, many of those running for president are producing a never-ending stream of proposals to diminish protections for person and property and destroy liberty.\n\nProposals to protect illegal aliens, including those with criminal backgrounds, by restricting the U.S. government\u2019s ability to deport them, make all citizens less safe. Policies (such as those in place in Seattle), whereby police do not prosecute shoplifting or other theft beyond some not insignificant dollar amount, deny the law-abiding the right to have their property protected and encourage more theft. Many of these jurisdictions and states make it very difficult for citizens to obtain guns in order to protect their property and person.\n\nMost dictatorial regimes start off by making gun ownership difficult before they get around to banning them outright. Beto O\u2019Rourke and other Democratic presidential candidates want to take your guns \u2014 at least some of them \u2014 at gunpoint if necessary. They argue that no one needs an assault rifle to hunt elk (actually you need a more powerful gun to do it properly). This stupid argument misses the whole point. We don\u2019t need guns to protect ourselves against elk. We need them to protect ourselves against Beto and his ilk, because they are out to take away our freedoms, unlike the elk.\n\nMany of the current crop of politicians are out to take away our right of free speech and religion. We are not allowed to use words they don\u2019t like, but most profanity is OK. I was a student at Columbia University during the free-speech movement of the Vietnam era \u2014 at which point we could tell ethnic jokes but were not allowed to refer to certain human body parts or sexual activities. I had lost an eye, and fortunately one-eyed jokes were not banned \u2014 so I heard and collected many because the joke tellers rarely meant to offend but merely to establish a bond. Dave Chappelle uses the N-word liberally in his new Netflix show. And that is to the good, because it is a direct attack on the word police.\n\nPresident Trump was attacked by the word police because he called what has been happening to him a \u201clynching.\u201d But then, videos emerged (thank God for videos) of Joe Biden and many other Democrats using the same word at various times \u2014 so, of course, the outrage subsided.\n\nThe government has no business regulating speech other than that used in misrepresentation of a good or service or causing direct danger (fire in the theater). I suspect that there is a growing majority which is tired of the faux or even real upset experienced by snowflakes. Either get over it or walk away. Your uptight humorless world is offensive to me.\n\nIf you are required to spend virtually 100 percent of your time working for the government \u2014 which the new communists and socialists call the collective good \u2014 it is because all of the \u201cfree\u201d stuff requires very high levels of taxation. It is modern-day slavery, because you have lost the right to most of the product of your own labor. Medicare for All, free college, cancellation of student loans, etc. etc. may sound wonderful for those who failed math \u2014 but in the real world, even with massive taxes on everyone (not just the rich), it doesn\u2019t pass the laugh test.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren says she will put in a wealth tax to help pay for it all. Assume you have a bucket of gold coins in your basement worth $50 million. The first year the tax man comes by and takes 20 percent of them. In year two, the taxman comes by again and asks for another 20 percent. How much does the taxman collect in year two? The answer, of course, is zero \u2014 because the bucket of gold coins is no longer in the basement. It is in one of the vast majority of countries with no wealth tax. France and some other countries tried the wealth tax experiment and, as any smart 12-year-old could figure out (as contrasted with socialist politicians), it did not work out as advertised.\n\nAll of the candidates say they will ban fracking and prohibit fossil fuel-powered vehicles by some magic year in the not too distant future. As noted above, the candidates appear not to have read or at least understand the U.S. Constitution, and somehow missed their math courses. They also appear to have all failed physics. It is not possible to operate a reliable electrical system with only wind and solar power, unless there is a huge amount of costly battery, or conventional or nuclear power backup. Batteries will get better \u2014 but at what cost and how soon? An all-electric car fleet will put huge additional demands on the power grid. There is nothing wrong with making an all-electric world powered by renewables, provided they are less damaging than natural gas, but placing arbitrary dates that cannot meet engineering and economic realities is dishonest.\n\nWhich is more damaging to the environment \u2014 plastic straws or private jets used by the political class? How many votes would a \u201csave-the-planet\u201d bill receive that both banned plastic straws and prohibited any current elective officeholder or anyone running for elective office from riding on a private jet?\n\n\u2022 Richard W.
