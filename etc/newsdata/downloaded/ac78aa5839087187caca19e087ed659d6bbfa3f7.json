REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nThe boycott follows a weekend marred by some of the worst violence since unrest escalated more than three months ago, with protesters burning barricades and throwing petrol bombs, and police retaliating with water cannon, tear gas and batons.\n\nRiot police on Monday patrolled the MTR subway, where some of the most violent clashes have erupted.\n\nHundreds of students gathered on the hilltop campus of Chinese University, one of Hong Kong\u2019s largest, taking turns to make speeches from a stage with a black backdrop embossed with \u201cStudents in Unity Boycott for our City\u201d.\n\n\u201cI come here just to tell others that even after summer holidays end we are not back to our normal life, we should continue to fight for Hong Kong,\u201d said one 19-year-old student who asked to be identified as just Chan.\n\n\u201cThese protests awaken me to care more about the society and care for the voiceless.\u201d\n\nOn the first day of the new school year, secondary students were seen singing, chanting and forming human chains, some wearing hard hats and masks. Many primary schools were closed because of a typhoon warning.\n\nMatthew Cheung, Hong Kong government chief secretary, told reporters that schools were no place for protests.\n\nStudents have turned out in significant numbers at recent rallies and were also prominent during the 2014 pro-democracy \u201cUmbrella Movement\u201d that foreshadowed the current unrest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very different from what happened back then. People are more mad now,\u201d said Summer, a 20-year-old student who only gave his first name.\n\n\u201cI think this situation is a deadlock now. Both government and protesters won\u2019t back down.\u201d\n\nProtesters had called for a general strike but most people appeared to return to their daily lives with shops open, trains operating and workers making their way to offices across the global financial hub.\n\nThousands of protesters blocked roads and public transport links to Hong Kong airport on Sunday in a bid to draw world attention to what they see as ever-tighter control by Beijing over the city, despite the promise of autonomy.\n\nAirport authorities said 25 flights were cancelled on Sunday but transport services were largely back to normal.\n\nChina denies meddling in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs and accuses Western countries of egging on the protests. It says Hong Kong is an internal affair.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated the central government\u2019s support for Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and her government.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s central government supports chief executive Carrie Lam\u2019s leadership ... to administer in accordance with the law and supports Hong Kong\u2019s police tackling the violence and chaos in accordance with the law to restore order,\u201d he told a press briefing.\n\nSeveral editorials in Chinese state media condemned the protesters.\n\nOne published by the state news agency Xinhua warned that \u201cthe end is coming\u201d for protesters who should \u201cnever misjudge the determination and ability of the central government\u201d.\n\nANGER AT CHINA\n\nAfter leaving the airport on Sunday, some demonstrators targeted the MTR subway station in nearby Tung Chung district, ripping out turnstiles and smashing CCTV cameras, windows and lamps with metal poles. Police moved in and made several arrests.\n\nLam, a lightning rod for protesters\u2019 anger at a city government they say is controlled by Beijing, said on her Facebook page on Monday that 10 subway stations were damaged by \u201cviolent offenders\u201d.\n\nPolice and protesters had clashed on Saturday night in some of the most intense violence since unrest escalated in mid-June over concerns Beijing is eroding the freedoms granted to the territory under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement, including the right to protest and an independent judiciary.\n\nJohn Lee, government secretary for security, told media that nearly 100 petrol bombs were thrown in various locations on Saturday with two found on a 13-year-old boy who was arrested inside an MTR station.\n\nThe unrest began over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people in the city to be sent to China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.\n\nThe turmoil has evolved over 13 weeks to become a widespread demand for greater democracy. China is eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Oct. 1.\n\nWith Hong Kong facing its first recession in a decade, China has also warned of the damage the protests are causing to the economy.\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\nShares of Hong Kong rail operator MTR Corp Ltd (0066.HK) fell as much as 3.9% to HK$43.65, their lowest since Feb. 15.\n\nWith protesters and authorities locked in an impasse, speculation has grown that the city government may impose emergency law, giving it extra powers over detentions, censorship and curfews.\n\nLam has said the government would consider using all laws at its disposal to bring unrest to an end.", "description": "Thousands of Hong Kong university and school students swapped classes for democracy demonstrations on Monday, the latest act of defiance in an anti-government movement that has plunged the Chinese-ruled city into its biggest political crisis in decades.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425315258&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810II"}
