No other regional force was willing and able to work with the United States to eliminate the ISIS territorial base \u2013 its so-called caliphate.\n\nBut neither Presidents Barack Obama nor Trump ever endorsed the Kurdish aspiration to create an independent state on the liberated territory.\n\nKurdish leaders have consistently hedged their bets, never fully breaking with the Assad government, tolerating small Syrian Army garrisons in a couple of towns under Kurdish control, and allowing\n\nOnce the last ISIS strongholds had fallen in late 2018, President Trump ordered a U.S. withdrawal. Secretary of Defense James Mattis resigned in protest. The president was eventually persuaded to cut the number of U.S. troops in Syria in half, rather than end the American military presence in Syria entirely.\n\nTrump\u2019s advisers hoped that this residual commitment could be sustained at least until a reformed government was in power in Damascus and Iranian forces had departed Syria. But there was never the slightest prospect of those things happening anytime soon \u2013 and certainly not during President Trump\u2019s current term of office.\n\nNeither Turkey nor Syria appeared likely to tolerate an independent Kurdish state. Unless the U.S. was prepared to stay indefinitely, the Kurds were going to have to come to an accommodation with one or the other.\n\nU.S. officials tried to arrange an accommodation with the Turks, but this neither satisfied Ankara nor permitted a U.S. withdrawal. So 10 months after his initial withdrawal directive, Trump reissued the order \u2013 and this time he meant it.\n\nEven if cynics say the United States has no moral responsibility to the Syrian Kurds, such clear abandonment could make it that much harder for Washington to recruit the next local partner when the inevitable need arises.\n\nIt was, in retrospect, a mistake for U.S. officials to have believed and encouraged the Kurds to believe American forces would remain indefinitely.\n\nClearly, those American officials wished to avoid the expansion of Syrian government, Russian and Iranian influence. They also rightly feared that an early U.S. exit could enable an ISIS comeback. But their first consideration could have been the well-being of their recent allies in the ISIS fight.\n\nEven if cynics say the United States has no moral responsibility to the Syrian Kurds, such clear abandonment could make it that much harder for Washington to recruit the next local partner when the inevitable need arises.\n\nForced to choose between a Turkish occupation and the return of the Syrian state, the Kurds predictably chose the latter. But they made this choice under the worst possible conditions, facing an ongoing Turkish invasion and a precipitous American pullout.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nHad the Kurds initiated talks with the government in Damascus after Trump\u2019s initial withdrawal directive they could have achieved better conditions and the U.S. could have pursued a more orderly and honorable departure. Such an arrangement might also have better assured continuing control of thousands of ISIS prisoners.\n\nInstead, the Kurds were faced with cutting a deal with the Syrian government at their time of greatest need, limiting their leverage and thus future autonomy.\n\nThe real choices before the Trump administration in eastern Syria were: staying indefinitely; preparing an orderly exit, thereby opening the way for the return of the Syrian state and its allies; or leaving suddenly without warning.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLacking an orderly process for planning and executing national security decisions, the Trump administration ultimately defaulted to the worst of these alternatives.\n\nIt seems unlikely that Trump can be persuaded to revert to the first option \u2013 staying indefinitely. However, the five-day ceasefire arranged between Vice President Mike Pence and the Turkish government may offer an opportunity to slow the U.S. withdrawal, assure that control of Islamic State prisoners is maintained, and provide the Kurds some breathing room to negotiate the best deal they can get from Assad and the Russians.\n\nJeffrey Martini a senior political scientist with the nonprofit, nonpartisan RAND Corporation.", "description": "The real choices before the Trump administration in eastern Syria were: staying indefinitely; preparing an orderly exit, thereby opening the way for the return of the Syrian state and its allies; or leaving suddenly without warning.
