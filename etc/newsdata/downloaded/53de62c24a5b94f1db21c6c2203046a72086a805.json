I want both of them'',' explained John, 40, who loved the new twist.\n\nNew rule: John Legend used a new show rule on The Voice on Monday to protect his first artists out as the Battle Rounds began\n\nHe was the first to use it, too, retaining 16-year-old Zoe Upkins from Nashville after initially choosing her opponent, Khalea Lynee, 36, from St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\n'I messed up,' he told host Carson Daly, 46. 'I shouldn't have paired them together.'\n\nZoe had put up a tough fight, displaying unusual stage presence as she belted Monica and Brandy's 1998 hit, The Boy Is Mine, but John was intrigued by Khalea's polish and versatility.\n\nKelly and judge Gwen Stefani, 50, tried to steal Zoe, who ended up staying with John.\n\nSaving singer: Kelly Clarkson also used the new season 17 rule to save one of her singers\n\nTough pairing: Khalea Lynne, Carson Daly and Zoe Upkins shared the stage after the first battle round pairing\n\n'Please do not leave me for these lovely ladies,' he begged. 'We got to keep this journey going.'\n\nKelly, 37, made the same appeal to her own artist, 23-year-old singer Melinda Rodriguez, from Miami, after choosing to keep her competitor, 28-year-old Shane Q, from Sacramento.\n\n'I think you're crazy talented,' she told the woman, who was earning her master's degree in music while teaching and working as a nurse on the side.\n\nThe steal: John moved into steal Zoe after declaring Khalea the winner of their battle round\n\nJohn then tried to steal Melinda, saying: 'While you have a very good coach right now, you have an opportunity to upgrade.'\n\n'You know, in college, my main pastime was arranging a cappella music, and I feel like we have so much in common that we need to explore,' he continued.\n\n'And while he was in college doing that, I was winning a competition on TV,' Kelly teased, securing Melinda once again for her team.\n\nTogether again: Melinda Rodriguez returned to Kelly's team after losing her battle round to Shane Q\n\nAll of the judges finally filled their rosters Monday, as the blind auditions came to an end.\n\nZoe was among the last chosen, singing Monica's Angel Of Mine, which reflected her love of R&B, pop and soul, and easily garnered chair turns from Kelly, John and Blake Shelton, 43.\n\nCalling herself 'an average teenage girl,' Zoe said that her late godmother, a Christian recording artist named Sarah Gaines, was the first one to notice her talent.\n\nTeen talent: Zoe, 16, impressed with her mature vocal during the blind auditions\n\n'The last time I saw her, she was in the hospital and I got to tell her that I was auditioning for The Voice,' Zoe recalled.\n\n'She couldn't really talk, but her facial expressions [were] so amazing,' she added.\n\nKelly and Blake both made a bid for Zoe, but John won her over by crooning a few lines from the song she would later sing, The Boy Is Mine.\n\nTurned around: Country star Blake Shelton turned for Zoe, but she picked John to be her mentor\n\n'You need to give it up,' he sang to the other judges. 'She belongs to me, Zoe is mine.'\n\nBlake's last pick was Matthew McQueen, 21, from Georgetown, Texas, who sang at local bars when he wasn't working his day job selling investments in precious metals.\n\nMatthew's sister and grandmother both had a dream that he was on The Voice, with Blake standing behind him and 'neither one of them knew I was auditioning,' he noted.\n\nLast pick: Matthew McQueen, 21, from Georgetown, Texas, gained the last spot on Blake's team\n\n'They had a dream that Blake turned his chair for him,' his mom clarified. 'Freaky.'\n\nThat premonition came true, as Matthew's sensitive rendition of Someone You Loved by Lewis Capaldi got both Kelly and Blake to turn for him, and fight hard to win.\n\nBut Blake's words and the dream made his choice easy.\n\nEasy choice: The Texas singer picked Blake after his sister and grandmother both had a dream that he was on The Voice, with Blake standing behind him\n\n'It doesn't matter what lane your coach is in, it matters what lane your coach can put you in,' Blake said convincingly.\n\nHigh school student Gracee Shriver, from Owasso, Oklahoma, took Kelly's last spot.\n\nThe ambitious 16-year-old served singer on the National Honor Society, played varsity tennis, and always did her homework the same day it was assigned.\n\nLast spot: High school student Gracee Shriver, from Owasso, Oklahoma, took Kelly's last spot\n\nShe had only ever been to one party, she noted, saying: 'I just helped clean up the whole time.'\n\nIn Owasso, Gracee regularly played a small BBQ joint, but her rendition of Kacey Musgraves' Rainbow sounded great on The Voice's huge stage.\n\nBoth Kelly and Gwen turned for her, and Gwen tried to bond with her over their connection to Oklahoma, the home state of her boyfriend, Blake.\n\nBig stage: Gracee regularly played a small BBQ joint in Oklahoma, but her rendition of Kacey Musgraves' Rainbow sounded great on The Voice's huge stage\n\nAfter Gracee chose Kelly, Gwen was the only judge left with an open spot.\n\nShe rejected Ty Mauro, a 26-year-old EMT from San Jose, California, who sang a breathy version of Al Green's Let's Stay Together.\n\nGwen however turned her chair for 16-year-old Caroline Reilly, from Cumming, Georgia, after hearing her sing Jefferson Airplane's Somebody To Love.\n\nGood effort: Ty Mauro, a 26-year-old EMT from San Jose, California, sang a breathy version of Al Green's Let's Stay Together but none of the coaches turned their chairs\n\nGwen had been looking for a teen to mentor, and yelled 'yes!' when she heard Caroline's age.\n\nWith the auditions over, the judges introduced their advisors, and prepared for battle.\n\nSeason six champion Usher, a 'diamond-selling artist,' would be John's aide for the season.\n\nBeing patient: Gwen Stefani was waiting for the right singer to fill her last spot\n\nFinal spot: Sixteen-year-old Caroline Reilly, from Cumming, Georgia, performed Jefferson Airplane's Somebody To Love and landed on Gwen's team\n\nThe host: Carson Daly kept the two-hour show on NBC moving\n\n'They gonna be excited to meet you,' John told him, as Zoe and Khalea walked in smiling.\n\nAs the two of them rehearsed, Usher suggested that they be a bit more pointed with their phrasing, but he admitted they were both incredible.\n\nWhen he saved her, John told Zoe he loved how well she took advice and got into character.\n\nSpecial advisor: Usher was serving as a special advisor to John's singers\n\nNext up was Blake, who'd asked Hootie & the Blowfish singer Darius Rucker, an old friend, to be his adviser.\n\nThe contestants he chose to battle at first seemed very different: Josie Jones, 16, went to agricultural school in Hamilton, Alabama, and listened to Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn, while Kat Hammock, 18, from Encinitas, California, taught piano, and dug Bread and Billy Joel.\n\nThey were both 'rootsy,' however, and Blake had them sing John Denver's Country Roads.\n\nOld friend: Darius Rucker meanwhile was helping out his old friend Blake\n\nTheir sweet duet had Kelly calling it 'the most angelic thing I've ever seen on this show.'\n\n'For me, Kat just has something about her that I can see and hear her making records,' Blake decided, picking the elder contestant.\n\nKelly's new advisor, Normani, won the show The X Factor with her band Fifth Harmony in 2012, which gave her practical experience with music competitions.\n\nPop star: Normani was serving as an advisor with Kelly during the Battle Rounds\n\nHer duet with Sam Smith, Dancing With A Stranger, blew up the top 10 charts in January, and she was the perfect person to advise on the battle song: Sam's Too Good at Goodbyes.\n\nThe song needed performers with a big range, so Kelly had Melinda and Shane face off.\n\nMelinda's voice was flawless, but she was too much in her head, Kelly cautioned, while Shane needed to embrace his falsetto and 'let in more air.'\n\nSage advice: Melinda's voice was flawless, but she was too much in her head, Kelly cautioned, while Shane needed to embrace his falsetto and 'let in more air'\n\nTheir funky duet had Kelly standing up and shouting, 'You're welcome, America!'\n\nHer fellow judges praised both singers' chops, though all leaned toward Shane, whose voice Gwen called 'a phenomenon.'\n\nKelly agreed, but then saved Melinda anyway.\n\nThe Voice will return Tuesday on NBC.", "description": "John Legend and Kelly Clarkson used a new show rule on The Voice on Monday to protect their first artists out as the
