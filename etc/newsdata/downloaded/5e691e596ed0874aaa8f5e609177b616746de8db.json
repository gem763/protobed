There were no major injuries as a result of the accident.\n\nSpirit squad members led the covered wagon out of the tunnel and onto the field before making a sharp turn. The angle of the turn and rate of speed resulted in the wagon tipping and two members fo the spirit squad being ejected from the vehicle. The horses \u2014 named Boomer and Sooner \u2014 ran off while still attached to the wagon\u2019s wheels and were not injured.\n\n\u201cThe Sooner Schooner tipped over today,\u201d the Oklahoma athletic department said in a statement. \u201cWe believe it was the result of weight distribution among riders in the rear of the wagon. Three individuals were evaluated at the stadium and released. All others reported that they were uninjured.\n\n\u201cUpon initial evaluation, it also appears the ponies are uninjured. Medical staff responded immediately as did the expert horse handlers and veterinarian who staff all games. We are grateful that the injuries were not serious and for the staff members who responded so well.\u201d\n\nThe Sooner Schooner takes the field at Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium after every Sooners score. It was introduced in 1964 and became the Sooners\u2019 official mascot in 1980.", "description": "Oct. 19 (UPI) \u2014 Oklahoma\u2019s Sooner Schooner horse-drawn wagon tipped over and crashed during a football game between the Sooners and West", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
