His work at the Russian-owned agency had nothing to do with his work for the conservative outlet, it said.\n\nMr Rouz acknowledged he had written nearly 1,300 articles for Sputnik over the past four and a half years, but in a statement filed with the lawsuit he said he had \u201cnever written propaganda, disinformation, or unverified information\u201d.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump says Afghanistan peace talks are dead \u2018as far as I\u2019m concerned\u2019\n\nOne America News described itself in a statement as \u201cwholly owned\u201d, saying it was \u201coperated and financed by the Herring family in San Diego.
