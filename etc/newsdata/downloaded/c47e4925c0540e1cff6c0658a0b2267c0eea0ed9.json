A series of surveys of manufacturing companies in Asia and Europe suggests a rebound is unlikely over coming months as tariffs on goods moving between the global economy\u2019s two largest players continue to rise. A similar survey in the U.S. on Tuesday is expected to send the same message.\n\nFresh signs of weakness in global manufacturing will put central bankers around the world on alert to provide further stimulus following a synchronized wave of cuts in interest rates over recent months. They worry that the longer the factory slowdown continues and the wider it spreads, the more likely it is to drag on other parts of the economy that remain relatively healthy.\n\nManufacturing activity in many leading economies has been slowing since early 2018, as factories touched full capacity after a long expansion and central banks raised their interest rates to cool demand.\n\nHowever, the slowdown has been exacerbated by a series of trade disputes, which escalated Sunday when the U.S. imposed tariffs of 15% on Chinese goods including clothing, tools and electronics. A round of retaliatory Chinese tariffs also took effect, targeting imports of U.S. soybeans, crude oil and pharmaceuticals. Additional U.S. tariffs of 15% on $156 billion of Chinese-made smartphones, laptops, toys, videogames and other products have been postponed until Dec. 15.\n\nTrade talks have mostly stalled since late May, when negotiators were believed to be close to a deal. Since then negotiators have sought, so far without success, to reach a limited preliminary arrangement that would have China committing to buying more U.S. farm products and the U.S. agreeing to ease off restrictions on China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nOn Monday, Beijing said that it had lodged a complaint with the World Trade Organization over the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods.\n\nThe impact of higher tariffs is already being felt among China\u2019s neighbors, which have seen exports to the world\u2019s second-largest economy decline. South Korea said Sunday that its exports to China fell 21.3% in August compared with the same month a year earlier, driving an overall 13.6% decline in exports. And Japan said Monday that capital spending by the country\u2019s manufacturers fell 6.9% in the April-June quarter, the first decline in two years, as companies grappled with a nearly double-digit decline in exports to China.\n\nBoth Japan and South Korea have said the effect is particularly pronounced in high-tech parts and materials purchased by factories in China, such as Japanese auto parts and South Korean semiconductors. The Chinese factories use those products to manufacture finished goods, some of which are exported to the U.S.\n\nManufacturers\u2019 profits are falling. Kobe Steel Ltd. in August cut its profit forecast for the year ending March 2020 by 60% to about $95 million. It said that tech companies were expected to buy less aluminum and copper and that sales of hydraulic excavators were likely to drop in China.\n\nParcel company Yamato Holdings Co. took a special loss of nearly $30 million in July related to a Chinese affiliate that handles parcels at Chinese airports.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\n\u201cThere has been deterioration in the logistics market due to the U.S.-China trade friction, and uncertainty over the outlook for this market is growing,\u201d a Yamato spokesman said Monday.\n\nIn China itself, August surveys of manufacturers sent mixed signals. One survey of purchasing managers that focuses on smaller, privately owned companies indicated a pickup in activity, while another that focuses on larger manufacturers pointed in the other direction.\n\nHowever, even the more positive news contained in the first of these\u2014the Caixin\u2014contained a warning on trade, as new export orders declined at the fastest pace this year.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s economy showed signs of a short-term recovery, but downward pressure remains a long-term problem,\u201d said Zhengsheng Zhong, an economist at CEBM Group.\n\nIn a number of Asian economies, similar surveys of purchasing managers had a clearer message, pointing to declines in activity during August in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Indonesia.\n\nThat trend was replicated in Europe, where a drop in activity was most pronounced in Germany, the continent\u2019s exporting powerhouse and a leading global supplier of machinery and equipment.\n\n\u201cTrade wars and tariffs remain the biggest concerns among producers, and the escalation of global trade war tensions in August encouraged further risk aversion,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which conducts the surveys.\n\nThe purchasing managers index for Germany\u2019s manufacturing sector rose slightly to 43.5 from 43.2 in July, pointing to a contraction as it stayed below the 50.0 mark.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What do these PMI figures indicate about the future of the global economy? Join the conversation below.\n\nOutside the eurozone, the U.K. saw a sharp fall in its PMI to its lowest level in seven years as concerns about the way in which the country will leave the European Union added to global headwinds.\n\n\u201cInvestment continued to peter out and heightened concerns about the U.K.\u2019s political situation and the strength of the global economy acted as a drag on activity,\u201d said Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply.\n\nAdditional U.S. tariffs of 15% on $156 billion of Chinese-made smartphones, laptops, toys, videogames and other products have been postponed until Dec. 15, after the period when goods are typically imported for the holiday season.\n\nMeeting in Jackson Hole, Wyo., last week, central bankers from around the world expressed growing worries about the impact of the trade war on their economies.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has already sought to cushion the U.S. economy against the risks from slowing global growth and rising trade uncertainty by cutting its key interest rate in July for the first time since 2008. With signals from the global economy continuing to point to weakness, it is likely to move again in September. The European Central Bank is also expected to cut its key interest rate this month, following a raft of other central banks.\n\n\u2014 Kwanwoo Jun and Chao Deng contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com and Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com", "description": "The fallout from an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China is rippling through the global economy, crimping growth in Asian industrial giants such as Japan and South Korea and hitting factories as far away from the front line as Germany.", "authors": ["Megumi Fujikawa", "Paul Hannon", "Megumi.Fujikawa Wsj.Com", "Paul.Hannon Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103267/social"}
