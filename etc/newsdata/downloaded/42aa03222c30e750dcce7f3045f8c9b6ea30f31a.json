That\u2019s when I got upset. A gunshot wound.\n\n\u201cThis actually happens to our black young men. If you saw it in person, it looked real.\u201d\n\nZakiya also shared a picture of her son online with the fake makeup to which many others branded it \"inappropriate\".\n\nShe wrote on Facebook : \u201cSo they did this in drama class and my boy said the teacher said it's like he got shot.\n\n\u201cI don't like that s*** ! I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s Halloween or NOT ! A bullet hole in the head.\u201d\n\nThe principal of the school later phoned Zakiya and apologised.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nThe mother also spoke to the unnamed drama teacher, adding: \u201cHe didn\u2019t think it was a real big deal.\n\n\u201cHe said he did paint on different kids, such as black eyes. He said was going to take it out of his lesson plan.\u201d\n\nZakiya said that while she signed permission forms to allow the teacher to paint on her son, she thought the design was \u201ctoo much.\u201d\n\nA statement from the school said: \"Birmingham City Schools is aware of an image posted by a parent on social media depicting a wound on a student\u2019s head. The student was participating in a theater class unit on stage, film, and special effects.\n\n\"The teacher sent permission forms home with students making parents aware of the unit and requesting permission to put makeup on students.\n\n\"Students were asked if they would like the makeup on their hands or faces, and this student chose his face. Students are never forced to participate, and they had the option to skip a design.\"\n\nThe school added that there was no malice behind the design and \"the only aim in teaching makeup techniques is to help students appreciate and understand the technical elements of performing arts.\"\n\nThey continued: \"As a culturally responsive school system, Birmingham City Schools takes issues like this very seriously and does not condone the graphic nature of this lesson on special effects.\n\n\"We regret any issues and perceptions this incident may have caused, and this portion of the lesson will be removed from the unit.\u201d", "description": "Phillips Academy in Birmingham, Alabama, has since apologised to mum Zakiya Milhouse and insisted there was no malice intended and it was part of a special effects class", "authors": ["Amber Hicks", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20710251.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MOTHER-has-slammed-her-seven-year-old-sons-school-teacher-for-painting-a-BULLET-HOLE-on-his-forehea.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
