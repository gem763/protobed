But I'm still really open to meeting her, as are the rest of us. I can't promise what I would or wouldn't say, but I certainly wouldn't be aggressive.\"", "description": "The mother of Harry Dunn has rejected an apology from the woman suspected of involvement in his fatal car accident, saying \"sorry doesn't cut it\".", "authors": ["Martin Evans", "Crime Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000212411040-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwUtKzlT97Z__qKOUp6dBm0I.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
