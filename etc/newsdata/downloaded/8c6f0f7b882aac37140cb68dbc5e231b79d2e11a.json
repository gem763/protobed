Poland must change more, and it must change for the better.\u201d\n\nAnalysts said the party\u2019s return to power would allow it to continue with the controversial reforms that critics \u2014 including the European Union \u2014 say have eroded liberal democratic standards in the country.\n\n\u201cThere will be a rising semi-authoritarian temptation on the part of Kaczynski and his people,\u201d Pawel Zerka, policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank, told VICE News.\n\n\u201cHaving won the national parliamentary elections for the second time in a row, and with a massive support, under very high turnout, they are likely to present their reforms as approved by citizens.\u201d\n\nREAD: The EU is pissed Poland keeps ignoring the law\n\nSince coming to power in 2015, Law and Justice has implemented generous welfare programs, which have proved popular with many voters. But it has also undermined democratic checks and balances along the way.\n\nIn particular, it has taken control of the public media, turning public broadcasters into government mouthpieces, and launched controversial reforms of the judiciary which critics labelled an unconstitutional purge which eroded the independence of the courts.\n\nREAD: Poland\u2019s populist government let far-right extremism explode into the mainstream\n\nZerka said he didn\u2019t believe voters endorsed Law and Justice\u2019s authoritarianism. Two-thirds of Poles surveyed in a poll conducted by his think tank carried out last month said they viewed the end of democracy as the biggest threat to their family. But the win showed the electoral appeal of the party\u2019s heavy spending on welfare, with the introduction of a child allowance, tax breaks for the poor, and hikes to pensions and the minimum wage.\n\nOn top of its generous welfare policies, Law and Justice campaigned on a pledge to reassert traditional Catholic family values in public life. Critics say the party\u2019s high-profile attacks on LGBTQ \u201cideology\u201d unleashed a wave of violent homophobia throughout the campaign, leading to international criticism, including from the U.S. ambassador.\n\nREAD: Poland\u2019s populist government has declared war on the LGBTQ community\n\nPiotr Buras, head of the think tank\u2019s Warsaw office, said the European Union would need to use all the tools at its disposal to pressure the government to stop undermining liberal democratic norms.\n\nThese included withholding EU funds, and using the so-called nuclear option of proceedings under \u201cArticle 7\u201d of the Treaty on European Union which would suspend Warsaw\u2019s voting rights at the E.U. Pressure from the EU forced Poland to back down on one of its controversial judicial reforms in December, reinstating a number of Supreme Court judges it had forced into early retirement.\n\n\u201cThey should be vocal that \u2018semi-authoritarianism\u2019 is a clear violation of what Europe stands for, even with a renewed democratic mandate,\u201d said Buras.\n\nThe results weren\u2019t a whitewash for Law and Justice. While they were an improvement on the 37.6 percent the party won in 2015, they fell short of the two-thirds majority of seats in the lower house that the party had hoped for, which would have allowed it to redraft the country\u2019s constitution in its favor.\n\nThe party also appeared to have lost control of the less powerful upper house, with only 49 of 100 seats \u2014 an outcome that would give the opposition some power to frustrate Law and Justice\u2019s agenda, said Zerka.\n\nCover: Leader of the PiS ruling party Jaroslaw Kaczynski speaks at the election night after first results showed his party won the elections with almost 43 percent support.
