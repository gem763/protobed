Silvano Aureoles:\n\nMore than 30 suspected cartel gunmen waylaid the police officers in the town of El Aguaje on Monday as they were traveling in a convoy to serve a warrant. Nine officers were also wounded in the worst attack on Mexican law enforcement in years.\n\nAccording to reports, the attackers claimed to be from the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, a new group that is seeking to replace the Sinaloa cartel of Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, who is now serving a life sentence in the US.\n\n'Peace with justice'\n\nLopez Obrador called the attack \"regrettable,\" but said he remains committed to his security approach emphasising tackling underlying social problems, even though national homicide figures have been setting all-time highs.\n\nThere were nearly 36,000 murders in Mexico last year, with the high rate of violence in large part down to drug gangs [ Alan Ortega/Reuters]\n\n\"We are going to continue with our strategy,\" Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday.\n\n\"For us it is very important for there to be well-being, that peace with justice can be achieved ... and also avoiding that authorities mix with crime.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in neighbouring Guerrero state, armed men confronted soldiers and the ensuing gunbattle left 15 people dead, including one soldier.\n\nThe gun battle took place in Tepochica town, security spokesman Roberto Alvarez Heredia said in a statement on Facebook.\n\nLike Michoacan, Guerrero is also known for violence linked to organised crime and the army has been targeted on other occasions.\n\nAlvarez Heredia said that the latest confrontation in Iguala town began after authorities received a call alerting them about the presence of armed people in neighbouring Tepochica.\n\n\"Armed civilians initiated an assault on elements of the National Defence Secretariat, resulting in the death of a soldier and of 14 armed civilians,\" he said in the statement.\n\n\n\nAuthorities later seized \"high-power weapons\" as well as three vehicles which had been reported stolen.\n\nIn Iguala, where the firefight took place, a turf war is raging between several criminal organisations. The area is part of a major corridor for the trafficking of heroin and marijuana.\n\nIn Iguala, 43 students disappeared five years ago after police handed them over to the Guerreros Unidos crime syndicate, which mistook them for members of a rival gang, killed them and burned their bodies.\n\n\n\nThere were nearly 36,000 murders in Mexico last year, with the high rate of violence in large part down to gangs.", "description": "Killing of 13 officers in Michoacan on Monday was followed by another shooting on Tuesday in Guerrero that left 15 dead.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/089ac6d444fc4b3fa1af2fa524891901_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
