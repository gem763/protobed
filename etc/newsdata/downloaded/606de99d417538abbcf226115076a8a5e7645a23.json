More\n\nThe comments from Power, who served as ambassador to the U.N. during the Obama administration, came a day before China published a list of more than a dozen items it\u2019s sparing from tariffs next week including shrimp and cancer drugs. A day after that, Trump tweeted that he would delay a planned tariff hike on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods from Oct. 1 to Oct. 15 as a \u201cgesture of good will.\u201d However, a two-week delay doesn\u2019t change the fact that the two sides remain \u201cstructurally at odds,\u201d Andrew Polk, co-founder of research firm Trivium China in Beijing, told Bloomberg on Wednesday.\n\nTrump already imposed new tariffs on thousands of consumer items from China on Sept. 1. JPMorgan estimates the tariffs will cost the typical U.S. household $1,000 a year, Yahoo Finance\u2019s Rick Newman reported the day they went into effect.\n\nAs Power noted in her interview with Serwer, there are people \u201cgetting hurt in the United States.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump meets with China's President Xi Jinping at the start of their bilateral meeting at the G20 leaders summit in Osaka, Japan, June 29, 2019. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque More\n\nPower made the comments during a conversation that aired in an episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.\n\nNot \u2018doing any favors for the Chinese economy\u2019\n\nThere are already signs the trade war is starting to impair the U.S. economy. A key survey out earlier this month showed factory production in the U.S. shrinking in August for the first time in three years. In other words, Trump\u2019s trade war is taking a toll on manufacturing \u2014 which the president has pledged during and after his presidential campaign to bring back to the U.S. Will Trump try to resolve the trade war before the next election?\n\n\u201cIt depends on how much President Trump is willing to concede, how much face he feels like he's going to lose,\u201d Power told Yahoo Finance. \u201cBut you know, I know one thing, and that's that President Trump will put his own political fortunes above the welfare of the workers that he claims to be representing.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Chinese President Xi Jinping likely feels he has the upper hand in the trade war, according to Power. But the Chinese economy might not be as strong as China lets on. While China\u2019s economy is continuing to grow, that growth slowed to 6.2% in the second quarter, according to Chinese officials. That\u2019s the lowest it\u2019s been since it started tracking such data in 1992. Alternative data shows the picture might look even worse for China, the Wall Street Journal reported this week. And the trade war \u201cisn\u2019t doing any favors for the Chinese economy, either,\u201d Power said.\n\nPower, who became U.S. ambassador to the UN in 2013, has commented on China before. In her new memoir, \u201cEducation of an Idealist,\u201d she noted that watching live footage of the Chinese government crack down on protesters in Tiananmen Square on TV in 1989 had a profound effect on her.", "description": "In a new interview, former U.N.
