We did some basic math: That means 708 stories, whether you liked Chandler\u2019s work sojourn to Oklahoma or not! Showrunners Marta Kauffman and David Crane, speaking at the show\u2019s 25th anniversary panel at the Tribeca TV Festival on Friday evening, admitted that at least two of these plots hasn\u2019t sat well with them in recent years, with the main one being Phoebe\u2019s stalker \u2014 or rather, when Phoebe begins to date a man (David Arquette) who was stalking her twin sister, in the hopes of curing his habits. \u201cWe did a lot of re-writing of that to make it work,\u201d Kauffman explained. The second one, she added, is when Phoebe\u2019s Navy boyfriend (Charlie Sheen) gets chicken pox from her during a romantic reunion before another deployment: \u201cI\u2019m not sure the chicken pox worked either.\u201d\n\nKauffman and Crane also divulged, during the rare occasions they view Friends reruns, that certain story decisions now take the fun out of watching. \u201cI don\u2019t watch the show at home, but occasionally if I\u2019m traveling it\u2019ll be on,\u201d Crane explained, \u201cand sometimes I\u2019ll see something and I\u2019ll be like, Wow, that actually holds up! And there are times where I\u2019m like, Yeah, alright, really? We went with that?\u201d Kauffman agreed, without adding any specifics. \u201cI watch the show once in awhile,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s much harder for me to enjoy the good moments when there are moments in it that I\u2019m just going, Oh my god, we let that happen? We did it?\u201d Was it Fat Monica?", "description": "Friends showrunners Marta Kauffman and David Crane admitted they regretted doing two plotlines through the show\u2019s run.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/24/13-friends.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
