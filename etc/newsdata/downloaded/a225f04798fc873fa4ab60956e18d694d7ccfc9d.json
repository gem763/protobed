John Kennedy: \u2018Don\u2019t Gaslight Us\u2019 on Ukraine-Biden", "language": "en", "text": "Moments after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Tuesday that the House is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, MSNBC anchor Chuck Todd found himself in a fierce exchange with Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) in which he accused the GOP lawmaker of \u201cgaslighting\u201d his audience.\n\nKennedy said that it\u2019s only fair to investigate the allegations about Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter\u2019s business activities in Ukraine\u2014along with accusations that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine to pressure the president into launching a probe of the Bidens.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe the concern about Hunter Biden by some of these folks making this case,\u201d Todd responded. \u201cIf they were so serious about this, I\u2019m trying to figure out why nobody from the FBI has been contacted. Not a single person.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why Rudy Giuliani thinks it\u2019s better to investigate an American by outsourcing it to a country that apparently they also didn\u2019t trust,\u201d the Meet the Press host added. \u201cDo you see why I\u2019m skeptical that the Hunter Biden stuff is really that serious? If they were serious about it, you go to the FBI, you don\u2019t go to an oligarch in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nKennedy said that Todd didn\u2019t know for a fact that the FBI hadn\u2019t been contacted\u2014before parroting the narrative that Giuliani and the president have been pushing since the story of a whistleblower complaint against Trump broke wide open.\n\nThis led to Todd and Kennedy tangling for the next few minutes. The MSNBC anchor asserted that there\u2019s no \u201cthere there\u201d with Biden-Ukraine, while Kennedy declared that there hasn\u2019t been an investigation of it\u2014likening Hunter Biden to a \u201cbank robber\u201d and calling Trump a \u201cpoliceman who beat up the bank robber suspect.\u201d\n\nAfter Todd repeatedly noted that there is no evidence that Joe Biden got a Ukrainian prosecutor fired at the behest of his son, he accused Kennedy of playing an old political game: \u201cWe have no idea if it\u2019s true but make them deny it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree, Chuck, and if you were right, I would agree with you. If you were right, I would agree with you. But you\u2019re wrong, this hasn\u2019t been investigated,\u201d Kennedy exclaimed. \u201cJust because you think that the\u2014I\u2019m not alleging the vice president did anything wrong. But I\u2019m just telling you the American people are looking at this and going, okay, umm, Mr. Biden\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think whataboutism\u2014how does that have anything to do with the president of the United States going to another world leader and saying, open up an investigation on my chief political rival?!\u201d Todd shot back.\n\nAfter Kennedy claimed that it has to do with \u201cUkranian corruption,\u201d the MSNBC anchor let out a soft chuckle, retorting: \u201cI am trying to be fair here, but you can\u2019t gaslight us, sir. Don\u2019t gaslight us!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not gaslighting you,\u201d the Louisiana lawmaker contended. \u201cI\u2019m telling you the facts. Do you deny those facts, do you think they got Hunter Biden\u2019s name off Zip Recruiter? I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think the American people do. I\u2019m not alleging impropriety. I\u2019m saying we need to look into it!\u201d\n\nEventually, Todd would end the lengthy and tense segment by telling Kennedy he wasn\u2019t going to allow a false equivalency to take over\u201d and that he\u2019s \u201cjust trying to present this fairly without gaslighting the nation.\u201d", "description": "The \u201cMeet the Press\u201d host accused the lawmaker of \u201cwhataboutism\u201d when it comes to Trump, Biden and Ukraine.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569364408/mtp-daily_6_qd2qbp", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
