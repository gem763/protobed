Mandatory credit Kyodo/via REUTERS\n\nHouston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey apologized on Monday for a Twitter post over the weekend backing the Hong Kong protests. The comment, quickly deleted, sparked anger in China, and broadcasters, sportswear companies and sponsors have said they would review their relationship with the league.\n\nThe NBA initially described the anger over the message as \u201cregrettable\u201d, but Commissioner Adam Silver told a news conference in Japan on Tuesday that it was not up to the NBA to regulate what players, employees and team owners said.\n\nBut on Wednesday, an editorial in the official English-language China Daily accused Silver of \u201cbrazenly endorsing Morey\u2019s secessionist-supporting tweet\u201d and giving \u201ca shot to the arms of the rioters of Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nIt said, \u201cIf Silver thinks endorsing the indiscriminate violence the radical Hong Kong protesters are resorting to ... is supporting freedom of expression, then he should think again.\u201d\n\nThe protests were \u201ca bid to liberate the city\u201d and \u201ca secessionist pipe-dream\u201d peddled by demonstrators \u201cto justify their summer hooliganism\u201d, it added.\n\nThe protests were sparked by opposition to a law allowing extradition to mainland China, but have since evolved into broader calls for democracy. None of the protesters\u2019 five demands is secession or independence.\n\nThe state-owned Global Times tabloid accused Silver of caving in to political pressure, saying the NBA was treating the Chinese market with arrogant disregard.\n\n\u201cTweeting something offensive to the Chinese people before a series of NBA promotional activities in China only shows a lack of intellect, respect, and responsibility,\u201d it said.\n\nIn a separate report, the newspaper also said that some Chinese netizens had made \u201cdisrespectful comments\u201d about the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201c(It) should remind Western media that for Chinese people, the Hong Kong riots are just like the 9/11, which is horrible and can\u2019t be justified,\u201d the Global Times said.\n\nNo one has been killed in several months of protests in Hong Kong, although scores - mostly protesters and journalists - have been hurt. The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks killed 2,996 people and led to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nChinese state television has already canceled plans to air exhibition games played in China this week, saying in a statement that a country\u2019s sovereignty and social stability were \u201cnot within the scope of freedom of speech\u201d.\n\nChina has accused Western governments of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong, which has been roiled by months of sometimes violent protest.\n\nThe furor comes against the backdrop of the U.S.-China trade war, which escalated in the last day with the U.S. government imposing visa restrictions on Chinese officials.", "description": "Chinese state media on Wednesday accused the U.S. National Basketball Association (NBA) of endorsing violence and peddling a \"secessionist pipe dream\" in an escalating row over comments by a team official in support of protests in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438634412&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9800A", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
