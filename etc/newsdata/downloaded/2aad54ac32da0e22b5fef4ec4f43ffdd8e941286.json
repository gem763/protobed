USA TODAY\n\nCHICAGO \u2014 Five years after a white Chicago cop killed black teen Laquan McDonald, Mayor Lori Lightfoot administration's on Wednesday released thousands of pages of records detailing the city's investigation into a police cover-up of the shooting.\n\nThe October 2014 shooting was one in a series of deadly confrontations between law enforcement and black men and women that spurred a national conversation on policing and an incident that fractured the already tattered trust of police in the African-American community of the nation\u2019s third-largest city.\n\nOfficer Jason Van Dyke, who shot McDonald 16 times, was found guilty of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery in 2018 and sentenced to nearly seven years this past January. Three other officers were charged with covering up the shooting but were acquitted.\n\nInspector General Joseph Ferguson's probe looked into whether other officers or department officials covered for Van Dyke in the wake of the shooting.\n\nLaquan McDonald shooting: 4 Chicago cops fired for covering up fatal shooting\n\nLaquan McDonald coverup trial: Prosecutors say Chicago cops failed to obey the law\n\nIn this Nov. 27, 2015, file photo, protesters take part in a \"march for justice\" in Chicago, in the wake of the release of video showing an officer fatally shooting Laquan McDonald.

Huh, AP)\n\nThe documents Wednesday revealed that Ferguson recommended discipline for 16 officers for their roles in the cover-up.\n\nAccording to the documents, Van Dyke also violated CPD rules, made false statements and omissions, and filed a false report during subsequent investigations. Van Dyke did not cooperate with the inspector general's investigation, which recommended he be immediately discharged.\n\nAlthough journalists had been demanding the release of the watchdog report for more than three years, City Council decided just last month to make the documents available to the public.\n\nFor Lightfoot, the release of the documents marks the fulfillment of a major campaign promise.\n\n\"Today, we are taking another step in our efforts to bring greater transparency to city government and releasing the Inspector General reports related to the investigation of the killing of Laquan McDonald,\" Lightfoot said in a statement. \"This marks another important milestone in a new era of rebuilding the trust between our city government and the communities we serve.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/09/laquan-mcdonald-shooting-chicago-officials-release-watchdog-report/3923312002/", "description": "Mayor Lori Lightfoot administration's records detailing the city's investigation into a police cover-up of the 2014  shooting of Laquan McDonald.", "authors": ["Grace Hauck", "Published P.M.
