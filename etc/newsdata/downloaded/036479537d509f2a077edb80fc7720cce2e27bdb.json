(\"Robex\" and/or \"the Company\") (TSXV: RBX / FWB: RB4) is pleased to disclose the following information:\n\n\n\nLaunch of the Mineral Sizer:\n\nA mineral sizer (mineral crusher calibration), currently in a commissioning phase, has been added to the plant\u2019s ore feed. This crusher will allow the Nampala mine to meet several objectives:\n\nThe crusher will make it possible to limit the passage of large rocks within the current grinding circuit. It will prevent stoppages due to the chute being blocked, which is a significant part of the unplanned stoppages currently happening at the plant. This will increase the plant\u2019s availability as well as its performance.\n\nThe crusher will also allow large pieces of quartz, generally richer in content, to pass through, which will contribute to improving the average grade of the ore processed at the plant.\n\nThe crusher will also provide a better understanding of the behaviour of rocks in the current process, allowing for the opportunity to treat all or part of the so-called transition ore that is currently not part of the reserves. This approach will test the possibility of being able to exploit them with the current process.\n\nRenewal of the MININKO permit\n\nThe MININKO permit has recently been renewed. It is a strategic permit for the future of the Company. This renewal follows two other renewals (Sanoula and Diagount\u00e9) announced on September 13, 2019.\n\nI. MININKO: On the road to discovering a new deposit.\n\n\n\nRobex has just \"renewed\" the Mininko permit for 7 years in southern Mali.\n\n\n\nThe Mininko permit covers 46 km2 and is located in the Sikasso region, 335 km from Bamako. This permit is attached to the Nampala Gold Mine permit, which is particularly interesting . It is its geological and mineralogical extension.\n\n\n\nThe acquisition of this permit is the result of very important explorations carried out in 2018.\n\nIn addition, and for the record:\n\nII. SANOULA:\n\n\n\nRobex has just renewed the Sanoula exploration permit for 7 years in western Mali.\n\n\n\nThe Sanoula permit covers 31.5 km2 and is located in the Kayes region, more precisely in the K\u00e9ni\u00e9ba circle. It is 450 km from Bamako. The geological context of the Sanoula permit reminds us of both the context of the Sadiola mine (carbonates) and the context of the Loulo mine (tourmaline facies). Moreover, the presence on the Senegal-Malian Accident permit, as in the case of Sadiola and Loulo and particularly the presence of an S-shaped change of direction to this structure, validates the potential of this permit.\n\n\n\nSanoula has several geological similarities with Nampala.\n\n\n\nDIANGOUNT\u00c9:\n\n\n\nRobex has just obtained a 7-year exploration permit for Northern-Diangount\u00e9 in western Mali.\n\n\n\nThe Diangount\u00e9 permit covers 52.14 km2 and is located in the Kayes region, precisely in the Kayes circle. It is 735 km from Bamako.\n\n\n\nThe proximity of this permit to the Sadiola and Yatela gold mine, as well as the presence of the Senegal-Malian Fault and Kl\u00f6ckner's Kakadian-K\u00e9r\u00e9koto Fault (1989), or the \u201cMain Transcurrent Zone\u201d (MTZ), are major factors that are influencing the potential of this permit.\n\n\n\nDiangount\u00e9 is venous with 5 veins having been identified within an 8 km pathway.\n\nAll of this will represent significant investments before reaching a situation where reserves are exploitable as well as a \"43-101\"; these investments will be made over time and for years to come.\n\nRobex\u2019s management team welcomes this great news that rewards years of hard work. It is a testament to the trust granted to Robex by Malian authorities.\n\nFor information:\n\nRobex Resources Inc.\n\nBenjamin Cohen, CEO\n\nAugustin Rousselet, CFO/COO\n\nHead office: (581) 741-7421\n\ninfo@robexgold.com\n\nThis news release contains statements that may be considered \u201cforecast information\u201d or \u201cforecast statements\u201d in terms of security rights.
