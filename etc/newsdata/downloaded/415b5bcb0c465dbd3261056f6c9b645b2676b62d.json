Neither was Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez or Chris Taylor.\n\nAll are right-handed batters, and all knew that if the Washington Nationals persisted in their playoff pattern of using starters in relief, they might very well be called upon to pinch hit against $140 million lefty Patrick Corbin.\n\nSo in the first inning Sunday night, that trio headed to the indoor batting cage that sits near the staircase leading from the visitors' dugout to the clubhouse to try to prepare. And, boy, were they prepared when Corbin entered. So were other Dodgers hitters, producing a postseason inning unlike any other: seven runs, all scored with two outs and two strikes.\n\nJustin Turner's three-run homer capped a startling and record-setting rally in the sixth as the Dodgers roughed up the starter-turned-reliever and beat Washington 10-4 to grab a 2-1 lead in their best-of-five NLDS.\n\n\"We're just always ready, no matter who's on the mound. Righty, lefty. You've got to fake it sometimes, whether you're ready or not,\" said Freese who singled as a pinch hitter in the sixth and finished with four hits.\n\n\"Definitely, two strikes, you've got to take it seriously. You can't assume your AB's over,\" Freese said. \"You look at the best guys in the game ... they look like they like two strikes.\"\n\nHern\u00e1ndez also entered in that inning and contributed a two-run double, and Taylor walked as a pinch hitter against Corbin.\n\nRussell Martin started, his first appearance of these playoffs, and hit a two-run double in the sixth as LA became the first team in major league history to score seven two-out, two-strike runs in one postseason inning.\n\n\"We never doubt ourselves,\" Freese said.\n\nMartin, who like Freese is 36, tacked on a two-run homer in the ninth. This is Martin's 10th postseason \u2014 Freese joked it might be his teammates 26th \u2014 and Freese's sixth.\n\nThe Dodgers can advance to the NL Championship Series for the fourth consecutive year by closing the best-of-five NLDS in Game 4 at Washington on Monday, when LA sends Rich Hill to the mound against Max Scherzer.\n\nAnd to think: Things were not looking all that good for the Dodgers, who entered the sixth trailing 2-1 after Juan Soto's two-run homer off eventual winner Hyun-Jin Ryu in the first and Max Muncy's solo shot off Washington starter An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez in the fifth.\n\nThat seemed to wake up LA's offense.\n\nWell, it was either that or the fact that S\u00e1nchez, who struck out nine, was gone to begin the sixth. In came Corbin, the lefty who started \u2014 and lost \u2014 the opener and hadn't made a relief appearance since 2017, when he only made one.\n\n\"Just couldn't seem to get that third out there,\" Corbin said. \"Just stinks.\"\n\nIt continued Nationals manager Dave Martinez's postseason penchant for pushing his starters to appear in relief, deemed necessary because of his club's NL-worst bullpen. The strategy had been working.\n\nNeedless to say, not this time against the Dodgers, who lost in the World Series each of the past two years and led the NL with 106 wins this season, 13 more than the Nationals.\n\n\"An\u00edbal was at 87 pitches. He gave us all he had. We were at a good spot in the lineup, where we thought Corbin could get through it,\" Martinez said. \"And his stuff was good. ... But he had every hitter 0-2. He just couldn't finish.\"\n\nAfter Cody Bellinger snapped his 0-for-8 start to the series with a single \u2014 he would add a double later in the inning \u2014 Corbin struck out the next two hitters. That's when it all fell apart for Washington.\n\nFreese, the MVP of the 2011 NLCS and World Series for St. Louis, singled to put runners on the corners.\n\n\"He has to be going down as one of the greatest October players of all time,\" Muncy said. \"I don't care what anyone says. He has to be.\"\n\nMartin came through on a 2-2 slider that landed on the warning track in left-center, putting the visitors ahead 3-2. Hern\u00e1ndez connected on a 1-2 slider for yet another two-run double to left-center, a hit off the base off the wall.\n\nAfter Muncy was intentionally walked, Wander Suero entered and promptly served up a full-count fastball that Turner lofted to the back of the visiting bullpen beyond left field, making it 8-2.\n\n\"A couple guys came up and had really big at bats and that's what we've been doing all year,\" Muncy said. \"That was one of those things where once one guy started doing it, the next cat picked up on it and it just kind of rolled throughout the inning.\"\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
