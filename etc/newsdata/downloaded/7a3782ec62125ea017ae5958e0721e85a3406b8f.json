It claims Tokyo is retaliating over South Korean court rulings that called for Japanese companies to offer reparations to aging South Korean plaintiffs over World War II forced labor.\n\nJapan insists that all compensation matters were settled when the two countries normalized relations under a 1965 treaty and that the South Korean court rulings go against international law.\n\n\u201cJapan\u2019s export restriction on the three materials were based on political motivation related to rulings by our Supreme Court on forced labor,\u201d Yoo said at a news conference. \u201cIt was a discriminatory measure that directly targets only our country.\u201d\n\nHiroshige Seko, Japan\u2019s minister of economy, trade and industry, told reporters in Tokyo he thought hardly any WTO member countries were sympathetic to South Korea\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cRegardless, it is clear that our action is consistent with the WTO,\u201d he said.\n\nSeko added that Tokyo would study the demands and respond according to the proper WTO procedures.\n\nIf Japan accepts South Korea\u2019s request, the countries must hold consultations for a minimum 60 days. If Japan refuses the consultations or if the talks fail, South Korea could request a WTO panel ruling on the dispute. The process usually takes about 15 months but may also last years, said Jeong Hae-seong, a South Korean trade ministry official.\n\nThe measures Tokyo introduced in July require Japanese companies to receive case-by-case inspections and approval on the shipments of the three materials to South Korea, which takes up to 90 days, compared to the previous fast-track process that took one or two weeks, South Korean officials said. Yoo said Japan approved the shipments of the materials only three times since the measures took effect on July 4.\n\nSeoul has vowed countermeasures and announced plans to similarly downgrade Japan\u2019s trade status and terminate a bilateral military intelligence-sharing pact with Japan that symbolized the countries\u2019 three-way security cooperation with the United States in face of North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat and China\u2019s growing influence.\n\nFollowing an angry reaction from Washington, Seoul later said it could reconsider its decision to end the military agreement, which remains in effect until November, if Japan relists South Korea as a favored trade partner.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to the report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "South Korea said Wednesday it will initiate a complaint to the World Trade Organization over Japan's tightened export controls on key materials South Korean companies use to make computer chips and displays.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kim Tong-Hyung"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/south_korea_japan_79404_c0-193-4608-2879_s1770x1032.jpg?8e79743f6a9fc69092ea9dd62d10cacd72986aa5", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
