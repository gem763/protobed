Yes. I\u2019m as afraid of colour as the next fashion editor, but this trend makes sense. Pale pastels have just as much power to lift your mood \u2014 and your complexion \u2014 now as they do in June.\n\nSo try stepping out in lavender, pale blue or a light wash to bring a bit of summer into the dark days ahead.\n\nALL DAY AND NIGHT\n\nLook to Rodarte for striking evening-wear inspiration (asymmetric hemlines, statement shoulders and ruffles) and Marni for wearable day outfits (their pink check coat looks great with a simple white T-shirt and jeans) all in sunny, sweet hues. You don\u2019t have to go pastel all over: Loewe\u2019s Puzzle handbag in a range of soft shades is on my wish list.\n\nDinah Van Tulleken (pictured) shares her advice on embracing this season's Autumn pastels and picks out a selection of items available in UK stores and online to suit all budgets\n\nSILK SHIRT START\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to find the sweet spot. This timeless and easy-to-wear silk shirt from Marc Jacobs at Fenwick, \u00a3395, is a fantastic place to start. A quick guide is to invest in pastel colours in autumn shapes and styles; wide-leg trousers, A-line skirts, roll-necks and jackets in heavier fabrics so it looks intentional.\n\nTop-to-toe pastel looks saccharine, so break it up with navy, grey or classic camel. Team with leather or crisp tailoring. If you\u2019re still shy about going too far, pastel accessories, bags and shoes can inject just a subtle hint.", "description": "Dinah Van Tulleken shares her advice on embracing this season's Autumn pastels and picks out a selection of items available in UK stores and online to suit all budgets.", "authors": ["Dinah Van Tulleken For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/22/20101578-0-image-a-31_1571864663101.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
