Martin\u2019s worst book into a Game of Thrones spinoff", "language": "en", "text": "We\u2019re still waiting on news from the first Game of Thrones prequel that HBO is developing, but the premium cable network doesn\u2019t seem content to stop there. A new report from Deadline claims that a second prequel series \u2014 this time based on Fire and Blood, Martin\u2019s fictional history book detailing the Targaryen dynasty \u2014 is nearing a pilot order.\n\nGame of Thrones finally ended earlier this year, but HBO was already hard at work on proposals for no fewer than five prequel and spinoff ideas before the hot takes from the final season had even finished cooling.\n\nWe already know what one of those proposals is: a prequel set thousands of years before the original show and books in the \u201cGolden Age of Heroes,\u201d created by Jane Goldman and series author George R.R. Martin, which shot a pilot episode earlier this summer. Back in May (just before the original show ended), Martin noted on his blog that two more of the ideas were still in play and \u201cedging closer\u201d to something more concrete, suggesting that \u201cmaybe some of you should pick up a copy of Fire & Blood.\u201d\n\nDeadline says that the new Fire and Blood series is a second attempt at adapting the novel from Martin and Colony co-creator Ryan Condal, following an initial attempt by former Game of Thrones writer Bryan Cogman to adapt that novel that HBO passed on.\n\nFire and Blood is certainly... a choice for a Thrones show. Unlike the Goldman series (tentatively referred to by Martin as The Long Night), Fire and Blood chronicles the 300 years directly preceding the events of Game of Thrones. It starts with Aegon the Conqueror, the first Targaryen king of Westeros who conquered Westeros with his siblings, and it goes all the way through Aerys II, the Mad King, who GOT fans will recognize as Daenerys\u2019 father and the last of the Targaryen kings.\n\nThere are a few issues with Fire and Blood, the book, however. The first is that it\u2019s unfinished; Martin has only written the first of two planned volumes in the series, which covers from Aegon I though the next 157 years of the dynasty. (The rule of Aegon III, the last Targaryen ruler to have living dragons until Daenerys, would come along another 150 or so years later.) And as anyone who watched the end of Game of Thrones now knows, adapting an unfinished Martin series is a difficult prospect.\n\nThe real issue is that \u2018Fire and Blood\u2019 is boring\n\nBut the bigger issue is that Fire and Blood is so boring. The book is written as an in-universe historical tome, allegedly written by Archmaester Gyldayn, and it\u2019s styled after Edward Gibbon\u2019s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which is a wonderful historical set (or so I\u2019m told) but not exactly entertaining reading. It is also 700 pages long, making the experience of reading it similar to that of slogging through a college history textbook, except none of it is real.\n\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily a deal-breaker for a television adaption. The events of Fire and Blood are, in theory, thrilling: Aegon\u2019s dragon-fueled conquests, succession crises, a dragon versus dragon Targaryen civil war called \u201cThe Dance of Dragons.\u201d But HBO will have to make some considerable changes in style and tone from the dry-as-dust book if it wants to make compelling television. There\u2019s also the issue that the later years of the dynasty (which, again, Martin has yet to write) obviously butts up against the current series in the sort of unnecessary prequel style that already haunts the Star Wars and Harry Potter franchises.\n\nThere\u2019s also the far longer time period, although that could be managed if HBO takes more of an anthology approach. A Fire and Blood show could, for example, adapt one monarch\u2019s reign in one season and then jump ahead in time to the next. Such a strategy could also help the network avoid ballooning actor salaries that helped Thrones become one of the most expensive shows that ever aired.\n\nAll of this is still in the early stages. Deadline\u2019s report only notes that a pilot may be nearing an order, which isn\u2019t a guarantee of any sort. And even if a pilot is shot, there\u2019s no promise that HBO will actually move forward with a full series. But with Martin attached to the pitch, an actual book to work off of, and the sheer amount of money involved in the Game of Thrones brand, it wouldn\u2019t be at all surprising if Fire and Blood ends up on our TV screens in a few years.", "description": "We\u2019re still waiting on news from the first Game of Thrones prequel that HBO is developing, but the premium cable network doesn\u2019t seem content to stop there.
