China acts vigorously to undermine the position of the West, but the response from the West has been tardy, incoherent and feckless.\n\nIt has been so for two reasons. One reason is economic interest of Western business communities \u2014 access to the Chinese market has been an enticing siren song. An open secret of China\u2019s rise has been its ability to control Western firms that hope to sell to it. But the price of access to China\u2019s market was that a firm\u2019s knowledge, intellectual property and practices would be siphoned off to aid Chinese competitors, who then would leverage out the Western firm and segue into a global competitor.\n\nChina\u2019s exploitation of Western telecom firms laid the foundation for the rise of Huawei, the Chinese firm that hopes to provide the world with its 5G network. As a rule of thumb, China\u2019s success in Western markets typically came about through providing the equivalent product or service at a discounted price. That has been a recipe for great economic success.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnother reason is a historically unique case of Western threat deflation. The West \u2014 and the U.S. particularly \u2014 consistently and gravely underestimated the dangers and implications of how China\u2019s rise changes international politics, and its ability to threaten and contest longstanding U.S. interests. The ignorance of the China threat was the greatest U.S. grand strategic blunder since the Cold War, and perhaps the most significant in U.S. history.\n\nFor decades, U.S. national security and business decision-makers have viewed international politics through the mindset of the Hegelian \u201cEnd of History,\u201d popularized by Francis Fukuyama. In this account, the world was inexorably moving toward democracy and free-market economics. Aiding China would be a \u201cwin-win\u201d for China and for the U.S.\n\nThis idealistic view was disastrous for U.S. foreign, defense and economic policies. Indeed, it remains so, as the interminable half-life of this sanguine perspective still contributes to a delayed response to China\u2019s expansion \u2014 this is especially so on Wall Street. This mindset is fundamentally pernicious as it is wrong, and it contributes to a dangerously pollyannaish and self-satisfied view of the U.S. position in the world. Moreover, it is demonstrably not shared by the rivals of the United States.\n\nHowever, this bleak strategic landscape may be changing as more people are willing to \u201cthrow their hats in the ring\u201d of the ideological confrontation with China.\n\nMovie director Quentin Tarantino\u2019s reported refusal to re-cut his film \u201cOnce Upon a Time\u201d in Hollywood to placate Chinese censors ensures that Sony will not be able to release the film in the large Chinese market. Of course, however influential, Tarantino is only one director. Nonetheless, his action deserves to be lauded and stands in contrast to Hollywood\u2019s avoidance and neglect of China\u2019s human rights abuses on the big screen, or craven portrayal of China as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) desires.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe considerable critical response both to the National Basketball Association\u2019s leadership and superstar LeBron James\u2019 disparagement of Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet in support of the Hong Kong protesters suggests that Beijing no longer may shape the narrative as it wishes. The fact that so many Americans enjoy the sport awakened many to the cause of the Hong Kong protests, to the despotic control the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) seeks to impose on Americans, and to how spineless \u2014 at least, in their initial, instinctive reaction \u2014 businesses often are in the face of Chinese pressure.\n\nSteve Bannon Stephen (Steve) Kevin BannonMulvaney faces uncertain future after public gaffes Steve Bannon: 'Focused' Pelosi will impeach Trump in the next six weeks Congress should strengthen laws outlawing domestic government propaganda MORE\u2019s new film \u201cClaws of the Red Dragon\u201d is an important fictionalized account of Huawei\u2019s Meng Wanzhou\u2019s arrest in Canada for extradition to the U.S. and its consequences. It is the first film to address this topic and provides an insightful exploration of the deeper issue of how the PRC penetrated Western markets and, ultimately, societies, as well as their objective. The PRC did so to gain access, prevent awareness in the West of the negative consequences of China\u2019s rise, and to forestall any Western response to hinder it, through bribery or coercion of individuals, firms and states.\n\nThe stark, ideological choice presented in the film directly mirrors the choice today: Working with China and Chinese firms is lucrative, to be sure, but only serves to aid China\u2019s global ambitions, which ultimately will cost Western societies their freedoms. Additionally, the film is significant because it shows what popular culture can accomplish and that, at long last, the U.S. has tossed its hat in the ring in the ideological war.\n\nThe common thread in these events is that, at the level of popular culture, there is an awareness of the China threat. The world China would create is one where Western freedoms and liberties are eroded, and finally extinguished, in favor of the political principles advanced by the repressive CCP. Working with China is a \u201cwin-win\u201d for China\u2019s businesses and the Chinese Communist Party. It the reverse for the West. If the West\u2019s hat is to remain in the ring, these early actions must be reinforced by a whole of society response.\n\nBradley A.
