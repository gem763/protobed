Mandatory Credit: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMedvedev walked out to a smattering of jeers in his quarter-final against Stan Wawrinka at Arthur Ashe Stadium court on Tuesday but was ultimately cheered after he dug deep to see off the Swiss in an entertaining four-set battle.\n\nAsked during an on-court interview to describe his relationship with the New York crowd, he said he had two words.\n\n\u201cThe first is electric,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd controversy, because what I\u2019ve done is not good,\u201d he added, referring to how he angrily snatched a towel from a ball person and showed the crowd his middle finger during Friday\u2019s win over Feliciano Lopez, leading to fines.\n\n\u201cSo many people support me, but still so many people don\u2019t like me. I can just say, I try to be myself,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cI have to say sorry guys and thank you.\u201d\n\nThe 23-year-old had never sought to be the pantomime villain at this year\u2019s tournament but when fans turned on him during his third-round clash with Lopez on Louis Armstrong Court, he embraced the negativity.\n\nThe match ended with Medvedev, arms raised amid a chorus of boos, sarcastically thanking the crowd.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I can say, the energy you\u2019re giving me right now, guys, I think it will be enough for my next five matches,\u201d he said at the time.\n\n\u201cThe more you do this, the more I will win, for you guys,\u201d said the fifth seed, who picked up fines after each of his first three matches at Flushing Meadows this year totalling $19,000.\n\nThe crowd let him have it again after his fourth-round win over Dominik Koepfer on Sunday when he performed a dance after match point.\n\nAPOLOGY ACCEPTED\n\nBut he was far more reserved on Tuesday and the crowd applauded his post-match apology and appreciated him fighting through a left leg injury that required a medical time out.\n\nMedvedev said the pain was so bad he thought he might have to retire in the first set but he battled on to reach his first Grand Slam semi-final with a 7-6(6) 6-3 3-6 6-1 victory.\n\nHis 23rd-seeded opponent Wawrinka had got a walkover against holder Novak Djokovic in the fourth round after the world number one quit in the third set with a shoulder injury.\n\nMedvedev, who will next face either Roger Federer or Grigor Dimitrov, has been on a hot streak coming into the U.S. Open, having reached three successive finals.\n\nThat run, which included a win over Djokovic en route to the Cincinnati Masters title, raised expectations he could be the one to break the domination of the majors by the Serb, Rafael Nadal and Federer, who have won the last 11 majors between them.\n\nMedvedev\u2019s trolling of the crowd had become the talk of the tournament, with opinions split.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of young guys that do things on the tennis court that maybe is not the best thing to do,\u201d world number six Alexander Zverev said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want the next generation to be known for that,\u201d the 22-year-old added.\n\nBut not everyone thinks Medvedev\u2019s antics are bad for the sport.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so funny,\u201d women\u2019s top seed Naomi Osaka said.\n\n\u201cEvery day, he has something new to say, like, he wins and then he\u2019s, like, \u2018Because of you guys I have the energy\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sarcasm is beautiful,\u201d added the Japanese, who lost her grip on the women\u2019s title with a fourth-round defeat.\n\nAnother controversial player, fiery Australian Nick Kyrgios, appeared to find Medvedev\u2019s antics entertaining, briefly making a photo of the Russian with his middle finger extended the background image on his Twitter page.", "description": "Russia's Daniil Medvedev put the bad blood between him and the U.S. Open crowd behind him on Tuesday, apologising to fans and thanking them after having encouraged them to boo him earlier in the tournament following his erratic on-court behaviour.", "authors": ["Rory Carroll", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425887503&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821YH-OCASP"}
