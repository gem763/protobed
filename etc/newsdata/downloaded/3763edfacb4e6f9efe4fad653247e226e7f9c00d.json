The video could open a 'new field' of science.", "language": "en", "text": "NASA/CXC/M.Weiss\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April, an international team of scientists captured the first-ever photo of a black hole. In September, they won a $3 million Breakthrough Prize for that accomplishment. But they're far from finished.\n\nNext, the team behind the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is planning a cinematic debut. The subject: the supermassive black hole at the center of our own galaxy.\n\nThe new project, called next-generation EHT (ngEHT), aims to capture real-time videos of the Milky Way's black hole to observe its behavior and see how it changes its environment.\n\n\"We can see the black hole evolve in real time,\" Shep Doeleman, an astronomer who leads the global EHT team, told Business Insider. \"Then we can understand how it launches these jets that come from its north and south poles. We can see how it evolves with the galaxy. We can even test Einstein's gravity in completely different ways, by looking at the orbits of matter \u2014 not light, but matter \u2014 around the black hole.\"\n\nVideos can capture how black holes devour large objects\n\nsupermassive black hole More\n\nEvent Horizon Telescope Collaboration\n\nThe black hole in the groundbreaking photo published in April is known as M87. In the image (right), the yellow-red ring is the accretion disk \u2014 a rotating mass of super-hot gas and dust from dead stars, planets, and other objects. In M87's case, that disk is larger than our entire solar system.\n\nThe darkness within the disk is the event horizon \u2014 the point beyond which the black hole's gravitational force is so strong that not even light can travel fast enough to escape. (That absence of light, of course, makes photographing or filming a black hole extremely difficult.)\n\n\"It tells us so much,\" Doeleman said of the photo. \"It tells us that there are near-light-speed motions of the gas around the black hole. It tells us how the black hole is oriented in space. It confirms Einstein's theories of gravity very close to the black hole boundary. Once you get a tool like this that gives you access to the inner workings of the cosmos, then you immediately just want to do more.\"\n\nblack hole More\n\nESO, ESA/Hubble, M.
