Archie receives the fateful phone call in Pop\u2019s Diner, standing in the same spot where his father nearly died two seasons earlier. He falls to his knees in disbelief.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cProbably the most important episode of #Riverdale we\u2019ll do this year, if not ever,\u201d Aguirre-Sacasa tweeted back in June, sharing an image of the script\u2019s cover sheet. \u201cA tribute to our fallen friend. Thankful for this opportunity to honor Luke & Fred.\u201d\n\n\u201cRiverdale\u201d shed its campy, neo-noir skin in honoring the actor and his character, instead adopting a more earnest tone to highlight the qualities that defined Fred. He dies right before the Fourth of July, meaning that his body won\u2019t be transported to Riverdale until after the holiday. Archie, in signature fashion, decides to take matters into his own hands and recruits best friends Veronica (Camila Mendes), Betty (Lili Reinhart) and Jughead (Cole Sprouse) to help bring his father home earlier. While doing so, he learns that Fred died doing what he did throughout his life: helping someone in need.\n\nWhen the teenagers stop by the site of the accident to retrieve Fred\u2019s truck, they encounter a distraught woman holding a bouquet of flowers. She reveals that one of her car\u2019s tires had blown out at that spot days earlier, and that Fred had stopped to help her while other drivers continued to zoom by.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe were working on the tire and a car just \u2014 it came out of nowhere, speeding,\u201d she says to Archie. \u201cI just froze in its path, and your dad, he pushed me out of the way. He saved my life. If he hadn\u2019t done what he did, there\u2019s no way I would be here right now. I know that.\"\n\nThe woman is notably played by Shannen Doherty, Perry\u2019s longtime friend and former co-star on \u201cBeverly Hills, 90210,\u201d the \u201990s teen drama that shot them to fame. In July, Doherty shared photos of herself with Perry on Instagram and wrote, \u201cI am deeply honored to pay tribute to Luke on Riverdale. The care \u2026 this show takes in honoring his memory is beautiful. He is missed. Today. Tomorrow. Forever.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the New York Post, Aguirre-Sacasa noted that Perry had been trying for years to get Doherty a guest spot on \u201cRiverdale\u201d but that the timing had never worked out.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe sent her the script, and she said, \u2018I\u2019d love to be a part of this,\u2019\u201d Aguirre-Sacasa said, adding that the episode \u201cis a meditation on what Fred meant to the town of Riverdale and what Luke meant to the cast and crew \u2014 and the audience that grew up watching \u201990210\u2032 and the audience that watches \u2018Riverdale.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe overlapping audience witnessed Perry\u2019s maturation from the teen idol playing sensitive bad boy Dylan McKay on \u201c90210\u201d to the veteran actor who, both on and off screen, gave sage advice to similarly rebellious teenagers on \u201cRiverdale.\u201d Fred was the show\u2019s moral compass and a steady source of support for Archie, a character often torn between his upstanding nature and his impulsive tendencies.\n\nIt is revealed in Wednesday\u2019s episode, for instance, that the car that hit Fred wasn\u2019t driven by the man who confessed to the crime, but by the teenage son he had been trying to protect. Upon learning this, Archie\u2019s anger contorts into anguish. He realizes Fred would have done the same for him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDoherty\u2019s character reinforces this notion when she tells Archie that, even in the little time she spent with Fred, he \u201ctalked about you the entire time \u2014 his son, how he couldn\u2019t believe that a man like him was blessed with such a thoughtful, kind boy.\u201d We could say the same about Archie\u2019s thoughtful, kind father.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Perry, who died in March, was honored on the show by his former \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" co-star Shannen Doherty.", "authors": ["Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Gz0-Up7YzyLp-bL2gS3CQxaw964=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V3LCT4BDVVHYZCWT3NY5REOVHI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
