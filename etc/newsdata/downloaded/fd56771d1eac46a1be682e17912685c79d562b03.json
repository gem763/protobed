However, what is different this year is that its average house price is significantly higher than 12 months ago, up from \u00a35,923,253 to \u00a36,500,070.\n\nThat comes even as high-end values are being affected by high purchase costs, huge stamp duty bills and concerns about Brexit.\n\nTemple Gardens, in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, is in second place, with average values reaching \u00a34,365,016, ahead of Phillippines Shaw, in Sevenoaks, Kent at \u00a33,884,107.\n\nOther big hitters include Dock Lane, in Brockenhurst, in the New Forest, Hampshire, at \u00a33,158,252, and Bennet Road in Salcombe, Devon, at \u00a31,856,229.\n\nCoopersale Street, in Epping, Essex was named as the seventh most expensive street with an average price of \u00a32.7million\n\nBennett Street in the seaside town of Salcombe, Devon, (pictured) is tenth, with average values reaching \u00a31,856,229\n\nNUMBER OF 'MILLIONAIRES' ROWS' IS DOWN 10% New research found there were 15,484 'million-pound streets' in the country, down from 17,289 in the same month last year The number of 'millionaires' rows' has fallen by 10 per cent, Zoopla revealed. It showed there are 1,805 fewer roads where houses have an average value of \u00a31million or more. The research found that in September there were 15,484 'million-pound streets' in the country, down from 17,289 in the same month last year. The report said: 'The bulk of the losses have been in London and the South East, which are home to the majority of million-pound streets but are also areas where house prices have been generally falling recently.'\n\nWhile wealthy homebuyers need \u00a36.5million to buy a home in the most expensive streets outside London, they will need to fork out more than \u00a330million to own a property in the most expensive street in the country.\n\nKensington Palace Gardens, in west London, has been named by Zoopla as the most expensive street in London for the eleventh in a row.\n\nHowever, the typical value of a home in the street has continued to fall for the third year running, currently at \u00a332,870,284, down from \u00a335,647,605 a year ago.\n\nThe prestigious address, which is just a stone's throw away from the royals at Kensington Palace, is home to some of Britain's wealthiest homeowners including Formula One heiress Tamara Ecclestone and Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich.\n\nCoopersale Street in Epping, Essex, has a typical value of \u00a32,727,798, according to Zoopla\n\nLondon's exclusive enclaves dominate the rest of Britain's top streets, including Courtenay Avenue, which moves up from third place last year to second place today, with an average house price of \u00a319,505,013.\n\nIt is followed by Grosvenor Crescent, where average values are \u00a319,065,523 and Ilchester Place at \u00a315,088,090.\n\nReading has the highest number of streets - 207 of them - where the average property is valued at more than one million pounds according to the Zoopla research. However, it is down 35 compared with a year ago.\n\nIts links with London and the riverside setting of some of Reading's better streets account for the high property prices in the university town.\n\nThe Surrey town of Guildford is second with 200, followed by Sevenoaks in Kent with 196.\n\nA total of 91 per cent of streets with an average property price of \u00a31million and above are found in the South.\n\nThe Ridgeway in Leicester (pictured) is also in the top 10 with an average house price of \u00a31,856,229\n\nZoopla's Laura Howard said: It's no surprise that it's the capital that plays host to Britain's most expensive streets \u2013 but even to the super-rich, the wealth that can be found among them is mind-blowing.\n\nPRICE ESTIMATES The research is based on Zoopla\u2019s price estimates, which used a complicated algorithm to suggest the values of properties around the country. The algorithm incorporates a number of pieces of data, including the number of property sales in a particular street at any given time. In the case of Montrose Gardens \u2013 the most expensive street outside of London - the algorithm showed only one property sale in the past 12 months.\n\n'Homeowners in Kensington Palace Gardens for example, have seen almost \u00a32.8million wiped off the value of their homes the last 12 months. But with typical property prices still shy of \u00a333million, it's probable they haven't even noticed.\n\n'Outside of London, it's exclusive pockets of the well-heeled home counties, such as Kent, Surrey and Hertfordshire that boast the priciest streets.'\n\nAnd, being one step removed from London's cooling market, some property values are even higher than last year, such as Montrose Garden in Leatherhead.\n\n'Even the broarder picture of towns that have the highest concentration of \u00a31million streets (on which the average property price stands at \u00a31million or more) shows a strong southern bias, with 19 of the top 20 all located in southern England, the exception being Manchester's Altrincham.\n\n'Ultimately, our Rich List is a fascinating insight not into how the 'other half' lives, but how the other 'one per cent' lives.'\n\nTOP 10 MOST EXPENSIVE STREETS IN BRITAIN Rank Street Name Area Average Property Value (\u00a3) 1 Kensington Palace Gardens, London W8 London \u00a332,870,284 2 Courtenay Avenue, London N6 London \u00a319,505,013 3 Grosvenor Crescent, London SW1X London \u00a319,065,523 4 Ilchester Place, London W14 London \u00a315,088,090 5 The Boltons, London SW10 London \u00a314,334,818 6 Compton Avenue, London N6 London \u00a312,617,782 7 Frognal Way, London NW3 London \u00a311,295,407 8 Albemarle Street, London W1S London \u00a310,985,823 9 Manresa Road, London SW3 London \u00a310,779,903 10 Cottesmore Gardens, London W8 London \u00a310,699,120 Source: Zoopla, September 2019\n\nThis property is in Temple Gardens, Ricksmansworth, one of the most expensive streets in Britain for homebuyers\n\nThe interior of the property in Temple Gardens (pictured above) suits belonging to a home on one of Britain's most expensive streets\n\nThere are now 15,484 streets in Britain where the average property value is \u00a31million or more, down from 17,289 in 2018.\n\nHouse price growth came to a near standstill in the year to July as the value of homes rose by just 0.7 per cent, the slowest growth in seven years, according to official data.\n\nThe figures from Office for National Statistics continue a three-year trend of declining growth in house prices, driven mainly by the South and East of England.\n\nLondon prices however saw a small uptick of one per cent in July, despite seeing the fastest drop in house prices since the recession in the year to May.\n\nPOST TOWN AREAS RANKED BY NUMBER OF STREETS WITH AN AVERAGE VALUE OF \u00a31MILLION OR MORE Rank Post Town Area Number of streets with an average property value of \u00a31 million+ Change since Sept 2018 1 Reading 207 -35 2 Guildford 200 -30 3 Sevenoaks 196 -22 4 Leatherhead 190 -16 5 Richmond 157 -13 6 Maidenhead 149 3 7 Rickmansworth 139 -1 8= Harpenden 138 -7 8= Esher 138 -17 10 Farnham 134 -50 Source: Zoopla\n\nThis four-bedroom house is in one of the most expensive streets in Britain - Lovelace Avenue in Solihull, Birmingham", "description": "Montrose Gardens in leafy Leatherhead, Surrey, has the most expensive average house price in Britain outside of London, rising from \u00a35.9million to \u00a36.5million in the past year.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/23/14/18827394-0-image-a-14_1569246867007.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
