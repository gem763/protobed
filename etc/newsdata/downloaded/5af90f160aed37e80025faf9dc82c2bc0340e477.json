That's why we've gone with a six-two split on the bench with the two nines covering. We can cover a number of positions. We can move guys around,\" Gatland said.\n\nRodrigo Silva, who started on the bench for Uruguay in their historic 30-27 victory over Fiji and is again among the replacements against Wales, said the win over the Pacific islanders was inspirational but it was the way they played against Australia, despite the 45-10 scoreline, that gave them hope.\n\n\"We played a great first half and we went toe to toe with a team who are one of the best in the tournament and in the world,\" Silva said of the Australia match.\n\n\"When these things happen you start to dream and to think that it's not crazy to think that every time we are a little closer.\"\n\nWhile Typhoon Hagidis has wreaked havoc with scheduling in the greater Tokyo area - forcing the cancellation of New Zealand against Italy and England against France - Wales and Samoa will face each other in the relatively calm Kumamoto on southern Kyushu island.\n\nGatland said he was not concerned about weather issues and his Six Nations champions were \"just concentrating on ourselves and hoping to finish on top of this group and then start thinking about the quarter-final\".\n\n\"Hopefully after Sunday we can think about getting down to Oita and preparing for a Sunday game against France. They will be very tough but we have to do a job this Sunday first.\"\n\nTeams:\n\nWales\n\n15 Leigh Halfpenny, 14 Josh Adams, 13 Owen Watkin, 12 Hadleigh Parkes, 11 Hallam Amos, 10 Rhys Patchell, 9 Aled Davies, 8 Aaron Wainwright, 7 Justin Tipuric (captain), 6 Aaron Shingler, 5 Adam Beard, 4 Bradley Davies, 3 Dillon Lewis, 2 Ryan Elias, 1 Nicky Smith\n\n\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Elliot Dee, 17 Rhys Carre, 18 Wyn Jones, 19 Jake Ball, 20 Ross Moriarty, 21 James Davies, 22 Tomos Williams, 23 Gareth Davies.\n\n\n\nUruguay\n\n15 Gaston Mieres, 14 Leandro Leivas, 13 Juan Manuel Cat, 12 Andres Vilaseca, 11 Nicolas Freitas 10 Felipe Berchesi, 9 Santiago Arata, 8 Alejandro Nieto, 7 Santiago Civetta, 6 Juan Manuel Gaminara (captain), 5 Manuel Leindekar, 4 Ignacio Dotti, 3 Diego Arbelo, 2 German Kessler, 1 Mateo Sanguinetti\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Guillermo Pujadas, 17 Juan Echeverria, 18 Juan Pedro Rombys, 19 Diego Magno, 20 Manuel Diana, 21 Agustin Ormaechea, 22 Tomas Inciarte, 23 Rodrigo Silva.\n\n", "description": "Wales coach Warren Gatland is billing their Rugby World Cup match against minnows Uruguay as a trial for quarter-final spots.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7884/f0c86bd3721648c3b0807e587f5ba3bb.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
