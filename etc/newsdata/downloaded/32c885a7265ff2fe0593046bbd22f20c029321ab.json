Could have been pancakes. Or tacos. It could have been banana waffle, but I choose the strawberry. Lydia was having the tacos. The waitress delivered our order. The waffle was punctuated by swirls of whipped cream. And laden with slices of strawberry. It was a thing of beauty. How could I not pull my phone out and take a picture?\n\n\u201cI have a dog called Waffle,\u201d I said. \u201cReally?\u201d said Lydia. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice name for a dog.\u201d\n\nWe were sitting outside at the Guenther Mill on the river in San Antonio, Texas. At that precise moment a text signalled its arrival with a brief throb. I still had the phone in my hand, but I hadn\u2019t started eating, so I thought it was just about acceptable to check it. It was a message from CambVetGrp (a veterinary service back in Cambridge). \u201cWaffle is due his flea treatment. Our records show that you might need some more. Please call 01223 249331 to order.\u2019\u2019\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nI went ahead and ate the waffle. What are the chances? I think I can guarantee that this precise set of circumstances will never occur again in the history of the universe. But I believe it comes under the heading of what Jung would call \u201cmeaningful coincidences\u201d or \u201csynchronicity\u201d. I eat a waffle in San Antonio, I speak of Waffle, and a text concerning Waffle simultaneously materialises on my phone. Virtually from Waffle himself, doomed to keep on scratching until I do something about his flea treatment.\n\nIt was the kind of phenomenon that tended to occur around Lydia Lair. She came to pick me up at the airport in her white Jaguar. About the first thing she said was: \u201cI\u2019m not Emma Bovary or Anna Karenina. I don\u2019t have time for love affairs. I\u2019m a business woman.\u201d Lydia Lair was immaculate. She was always immaculate. She was slim with squarish glasses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not Emma Bovary or Anna Karenina. They both came to a fairly sticky end, didn\u2019t they?\u201d\n\nShe had been to see the ballet of Anna Karenina in Montr\u00e9al not too long ago. \u201cWhat did they do about the train?\u201d I asked, never having seen it. \u201cOh they had a train all right,\u201d she said. \u201cThe train steamed across the stage right at the beginning. And then again at the end.\u201d\n\nThe invention of the train had expanded the ways available for unhappy people to commit suicide. I knew at least one guy who had chosen to go out that way (he was an economist, saving on rope or gun). The train was an effective tool, no question. Tough on train drivers, though, who were being used as involuntary executioners.\n\nLydia Lair was neither Anna Karenina nor Emma Bovary, but she was Lydia Lair. Which I know sounds like a tautology, but isn\u2019t. She could have been Chang, for instance, or Stashower, or any number of more minor female characters. But she wasn\u2019t. She was Lydia Lair. In fact, she was more Lydia Lair than she had any right to be.\n\nLydia Lair, readers will recall, is one of the victims of the home invasion scene (chapter 39), in the novel Make Me, part of Lee Child\u2019s Jack Reacher series. She is married to a doctor by the name of Evan Lair. Her older brother is Peter McCann (also known as \u201cMaloney\u201d), who goes missing. But it could have been different.\n\nLee Child liked the name Lydia Lair. It reminded him of Lois Lane and Lana Lang in Superman. Back in February 2015, in the midst of writing Make Me, he toyed with the idea of giving the name to his main woman character, now known as \u201cChang\u201d. But, appealing though the name was, he decided that he didn\u2019t want \u201cLair said\u201d too often (one \u201cai\u201d word too many).\n\nShe could have died. Which is to say that Child was threatening her with death. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Lydia is going to get through the day,\u201d Child would say. \u201cThere are going to be bullets flying every which way.\u201d Or, \u201cLydia is looking like a goner.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s put her out of her misery.\u201d And so on.\n\n\n\nI like to think that I had a hand in saving Lydia. I happened to be sitting on a couch in his office on the Upper West Side, studying the creative process on the wing. And unable to remain strictly on the sidelines. \u201cOh come on, give her a chance!\u201d I would say. Or, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that! She\u2019s paid thousands of dollars to be in the book. To a good cause as well...\u201d\n\nThat was the unvarnished truth. Lydia Lair, the real Lydia Lair, who lived in San Antonio, Texas, had bought the right to have her name in the book at a black-tie charity auction in South Carolina, back in February 2015. She would be immortalised by author Lee Child. She was already a fan of his work, had read all his novels, was half in love with the character of Jack Reacher. Fantasized about him, the way one does. Therefore, she stuck her hand up when it came to the auction of (I imagine) \u201ccharacters name in the next Lee Child novel\u2019\u2019.\n\nIt is the kind of thing big commercial writers (such as Stephen King and John Grisham) do these days: auction off the rights to a character. Maybe they have difficulty dreaming up names anyway. It\u2019s easier this way, and it\u2019s all for charity.\n\nWho knows, maybe Lydia Lair would get to hang out with Reacher. Maybe she would fight Reacher or make love to him. None of that was a given, the novel hadn\u2019t been written yet. It was maybe half-written. Child knew nothing of the existence of Lydia Lair. But, if she put her hand up often enough, he would. It was a popular ticket.\n\nFinally, she saw that it was down to her and one other woman. The price tag was getting ridiculous. She\u2019d never intended to donate this much money. It was crazy. She and her husband, art lovers and collectors, had been to many charitable functions over the years, but this was the first time they had gone out on a limb. They tended to favour \u201csilent auction items\u201d (no bidding wars). The Lairs looked at one another. \u201cOne more bid,\u201d she said, and stuck her hand up one last time. The other woman (her merely mortal name unknown) surrendered and dropped out. Lydia Lair had won. She was in.\n\nHer name was duly communicated to Child. It registered in his mind, he typed it out, it appeared on his computer screen, he started playing around with it when he was on vacation in Bermuda, and it ended up in the book.\n\nLydia Lair, the real Lydia Lair, who lived in San Antonio, Texas, had bought the right to have her name in the book at a black-tie charity auction in South Carolina, back in February 2015. She would be immortalised by author Lee Child\n\nObviously, I had to have lunch with her. It was the closest I was going to get to having lunch with Reacher himself. I would be breaking bread with a real live fictional character.\n\nBut first of all, Lydia emailed me. Imagine if a message from Emma.Bovary@gmail.com were to drop into your inbox. This was on a par. Lydia Lair had read Make Me. Child had given her a copy, it was all part of the deal. And now she had read the book. Which had shocked her, Child, and me. Lydia Lair really did have an \u201cEvan\u201d in her life; and she had had a brother who died.\n\n\n\n\u201cOther than family members and close friends back in 1968, no one has ever known about Evan. You can imagine how shocked I was to read the name in the book as my husband.\u201d Evan: fianc\u00e9; car-crash (long ago). Brother: \u201ctragic accident\u201d (recent) on his farm. So reading the book was both pleasure and trauma for her. She was excited whenever she came up against her own name. Hey, look, it\u2019s me! I\u2019m talking to Jack Reacher. And then every time she read the word \u201cEvan,\u201d or the word \u201cbrother,\u201d her heart skipped a beat. It was almost unbearable for her. But at the same time a form of catharsis or exorcism, the tragic mix of pity and terror. She was reliving her own life, mediated through the writing of Child. And feeling ripped apart.\n\nThere were further parallels. She had been brought up \u201con a small wheat farm in a dusty town in western Kansas\u201d, similar to Mother\u2019s Rest, the fictional location of the major action of the novel. In Make Me, Lydia Lair is hosting a party for her daughter who is getting married. In the world beyond the novel, Lydia Lair was mother to the groom: her son was due to get married in Colorado on 26 September.\n\nImmortality in fiction Just donate to charity You could be shot dead and still achieve immortality. Or you might get to spend a night of bliss with your favourite hero or heroine. All you have to do is make a donation to a charity. Increasingly, authors are auctioning off the right to have your name glued to one of their characters.\n\n\n\nBestselling writers like Stephen King, John Grisham, Margaret Atwood, Tracy Chevalier, and romance novelist Katie Fforde are among those who have joined forces with charities like Freedom from Torture and CLIC Sargent to enable readers to get their names in print and raise money for good causes.\n\n\n\nOne regular on eBay is Frances Neagley, who has become a serial character, appearing in works by different authors, including Lee Child (who dedicated Bad Luck and Troubleto her) and Ian Rankin. In a recent twist, Child and fellow thriller writer Karin Slaughter paid $5000 each to have their names in Rankin\u2019s next Rebus adventure. Which, given their eminence in the crime genre, could make life awkward for the author. \u2018We did it to wind him up,\u2019 says Child. Rankin said: \u2018It\u2019s not easy. I\u2019ll find a way though.\u2019\n\nBut here was the great mystery: how did Child know? There was no way he could know. He only had the name \u201cLydia Lair\u201d to work with. That is all he had. That is all he was given. He knew nothing of the woman herself, her life and loves. She was a closed book to him, not even a book, nothing but a few syllables. And yet it was like she was sitting there in the room, posing for a portrait, freely answering questions, and providing far more than name, rank, and serial number.\n\nHe liked the sound of the name, but was blissfully unaware of the individual the name was attached to, his character\u2019s objective correlative back in San Antonio. Which was fine as far as he was concerned. I was more curious. I had asked him when he was writing. \u201cWho is Lydia Lair? Where does she come from?\u201d \u201cShe is whoever I say she is,\u201d he would reply. Lydia Lair, c\u2019est moi. \u201cShe is someone who wrote out a big fat check to have her name in my book.\u201d\n\n\n\nI wanted him to find out who she really was, but he couldn\u2019t be bothered. After all, he had to write. The deadline was only a couple of months away.\n\nHe wrote Make Me in the third person, using close point of view some of the time, and some of the time the detached omniscient narrator, who sees all and knows all. But the strange thing was, in Child\u2019s case, it wasn\u2019t a metaphor: he really did seem to have attained some measure of omniscience. He knew stuff he had no right to know. Lydia confessed, in her email, to being mystified. \u201cLee is a brilliant writer who always amazes me with facts, quotations, experiences, so detailed and in depth that I think it must be personal, and then the next year, I read a totally different book in a different location, etc....\n\nOf all his books I\u2019ve read, this was clearly the one for a character with my name who would ever have known?\u201d\n\nSceptics said: \u201cYou\u2019re making this up.\u201d I would say, \u201cYou can\u2019t make this up.\u201d On the other hand, Child was making it up, wasn\u2019t he? Or maybe he wasn\u2019t making it up at all and the book was pure mimesis.\n\nI had read about Lydia Lair. I had received emails with her name on them. But I had to have more.\n\nI loved San Antonio. It was summer again, in October. The Lairs lived in Alamo Heights. Lydia took me to the Alamo itself, which turned out to be a fairly small but rather beautiful fortress, all in white, in the Spanish hacienda style, downtown, just across the river. A lot of men had died there, heroically, back in the 19th century. Lydia took me on walks along the river and to an archetypal Tex Mex restaurant with amazing murals and real mariachis. I was forced to drink margaritas, champagne and finally Armagnac. But I managed to hold it all together and concen\u200btrate on what I was there for, namely the the book and her role in it. And the meaningful coincidences that linked the character of Lydia Lair and the real Lydia Lair.\n\nIt was a phrase Lee had used himself, when he inscribed a copy of the book, \u201cTo the real Lydia Lair, with thanks for your kindness.\u201d Which didn\u2019t surprise me. But it did surprise her. \u201cWe were flabbergasted,\u201d she said. A word you don\u2019t hear that often. A bit more than surprised. Astonished but (briefly) reduced to confusion and perplexity. The reason being: she didn\u2019t even know that she was supposed to be bestowing her name on a character in the book.\n\n\u201cBut wasn\u2019t that the whole point?\u201d I said, utterly mystified. \u201cWasn\u2019t that exactly what you were paying for?\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 40 books to read before you die Show all 40 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 40 books to read before you die 1/40 Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen It is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don\u2019t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart expos\u00e9 of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there\u2019s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face. 2/40 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 \u00be, Sue Townsend Read this one when you\u2019re decrepit enough, and chances are you\u2019ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there\u2019s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain. 3/40 Catch 22, Joseph Heller It\u2019s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book\u2019s glorious rage. 4/40 Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles, Thomas Hardy A good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a na\u00efve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the \u201cshame\u201d of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming. 5/40 Things fall apart, Chinua Achebe A classic expos\u00e9 of colonialism, Achebe\u2019s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work. 6/40 1984, George Orwell The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it\u2019s become a clich\u00e9. But forget TV\u2019s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind. 7/40 To kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America\u2019s racist South during the depression years, Lee\u2019s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but \u201ca quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers\u201d: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum. 8/40 Great Expectations, Charles Dickens Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don\u2019t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens\u2019 luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose. 9/40 The God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy Roy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating \u201cwho should be loved, and how. And how much\u201d. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it\u2019s all there in this beautiful and haunting book. 10/40 Wolf Hall, Hilary Mantel In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition. 11/40 The Code of the Woosters, PG Wodehouse If you haven\u2019t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven\u2019t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts. 12/40 Frankenstein, Mary Shelley Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein\u2019s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 13/40 Lord of the Flies, William Golding Anyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding\u2019s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile. 14/40 Midnight's Children, Salman Rushdie The protagonist of Rushdie\u2019s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He\u2019s also born with superpowers, and he\u2019s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India\u2019s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities. 15/40 Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature\u2019s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the \u201csmall, plain\u201d Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplomb 16/40 Middlemarch, George Eliot This is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829\u201332. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius; but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. 17/40 Secret History, Donna Tartt Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. 18/40 Americanah, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash divisions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch. 19/40 Cold Comfort Farm, Stella Gibbons An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you\u2019ve \u201cseen something nasty in the woodshed,\u201d just shut the door. 20/40 Beloved, Toni Morrison Dedicated to the \u201cSixty Million and more\u201d Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America\u2019s history. 21/40 Brideshead Revisited, Evelyn Waugh Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles\u2019s entire relationship with Sebastian\u2019s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts\u2026) and you\u2019re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. 22/40 Dune, Frank Herbert You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It\u2019s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it\u2019s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised. 23/40 Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy\u2019s every command. It\u2019s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers; Emily Bronte\u2019s vision of nature blazes with poetry. 24/40 The Great Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s third novel \u2013 \u201cno more than a glorified anecdote\u201d; \u201cfor the season only\u201d \u2013 failed to recognise something truly great; a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal\u2019s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann\u2019s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald\u2019s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men\u2019s Don Draper and beyond. 25/40 A Clockwork Orange, Anthony Burgess From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it\u2019s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess\u2019s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece. 26/40 Lolita, Vladimir Nabokov Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her \u201cLolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.\u201d Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert\u2019s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides. 27/40 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K Dick Here be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen \u2013 the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed. 28/40 Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad Inspired by Conrad\u2019s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it\u2019s deeply involving and demands to be read. 29/40 Dracula, Bram Stoker Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer \u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It\u2019s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker\u2019s hands he\u2019s also bloody creepy. 30/40 The Catcher in the Rye, J D Salinger It only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger\u2019s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details \u201cand all that David Copperfield kind of crap\u201d. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose. 31/40 The Big Sleep, Raymond Chandler Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her \u201clittle sharp predatory teeth\u201d and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men. 32/40 Vanity Fair, William Makepeace Thackeray All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray\u2019s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature\u2019s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she\u2019s all the more compelling for that. 33/40 The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book\u2019s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar \u2013 used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments \u2013 struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel\u2019s publication in 1963. 34/40 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl Harry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka\u2019s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl\u2019s startling work of fantasy. 35/40 Anna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy Andrew Davies\u2019s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can\u2019t quite face returning to the novel\u2019s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina \u2013 enormous, too! \u2013the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society\u2019s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. 36/40 Dangerous Liaisons, Pierre Choderlos de Laclos The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise\u2019s justification for her behaviour \u2013 \u201cI, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours\u201d \u2013 will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos\u2019s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 37/40 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez The energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez\u2019s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez\u2019s magical realism unique. 38/40 The Trial, Frank Kafka \u201cSomeone must have been telling lies about Josef K\u2026\u201d So begins Kafka\u2019s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they\u2019re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it\u2019s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance. 39/40 Rebecca, Daphne du Maurier The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier\u2019s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. 40/40 The Leopard, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa\u2019s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi\u2019s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It\u2019s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces. 1/40 Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen It is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don\u2019t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart expos\u00e9 of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there\u2019s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face. 2/40 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 \u00be, Sue Townsend Read this one when you\u2019re decrepit enough, and chances are you\u2019ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there\u2019s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain. 3/40 Catch 22, Joseph Heller It\u2019s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book\u2019s glorious rage. 4/40 Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles, Thomas Hardy A good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a na\u00efve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the \u201cshame\u201d of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming. 5/40 Things fall apart, Chinua Achebe A classic expos\u00e9 of colonialism, Achebe\u2019s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work. 6/40 1984, George Orwell The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it\u2019s become a clich\u00e9. But forget TV\u2019s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind. 7/40 To kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America\u2019s racist South during the depression years, Lee\u2019s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but \u201ca quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers\u201d: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum. 8/40 Great Expectations, Charles Dickens Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don\u2019t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens\u2019 luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose. 9/40 The God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy Roy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating \u201cwho should be loved, and how. And how much\u201d. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it\u2019s all there in this beautiful and haunting book. 10/40 Wolf Hall, Hilary Mantel In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition. 11/40 The Code of the Woosters, PG Wodehouse If you haven\u2019t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven\u2019t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts. 12/40 Frankenstein, Mary Shelley Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein\u2019s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 13/40 Lord of the Flies, William Golding Anyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding\u2019s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile. 14/40 Midnight's Children, Salman Rushdie The protagonist of Rushdie\u2019s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He\u2019s also born with superpowers, and he\u2019s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India\u2019s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities. 15/40 Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature\u2019s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the \u201csmall, plain\u201d Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplomb 16/40 Middlemarch, George Eliot This is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829\u201332. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius; but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. 17/40 Secret History, Donna Tartt Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. 18/40 Americanah, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash divisions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch. 19/40 Cold Comfort Farm, Stella Gibbons An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you\u2019ve \u201cseen something nasty in the woodshed,\u201d just shut the door. 20/40 Beloved, Toni Morrison Dedicated to the \u201cSixty Million and more\u201d Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America\u2019s history. 21/40 Brideshead Revisited, Evelyn Waugh Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles\u2019s entire relationship with Sebastian\u2019s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts\u2026) and you\u2019re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. 22/40 Dune, Frank Herbert You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It\u2019s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it\u2019s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised. 23/40 Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy\u2019s every command. It\u2019s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers; Emily Bronte\u2019s vision of nature blazes with poetry. 24/40 The Great Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s third novel \u2013 \u201cno more than a glorified anecdote\u201d; \u201cfor the season only\u201d \u2013 failed to recognise something truly great; a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal\u2019s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann\u2019s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald\u2019s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men\u2019s Don Draper and beyond. 25/40 A Clockwork Orange, Anthony Burgess From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it\u2019s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess\u2019s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece. 26/40 Lolita, Vladimir Nabokov Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her \u201cLolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.\u201d Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert\u2019s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides. 27/40 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K Dick Here be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen \u2013 the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed. 28/40 Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad Inspired by Conrad\u2019s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it\u2019s deeply involving and demands to be read. 29/40 Dracula, Bram Stoker Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer \u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It\u2019s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker\u2019s hands he\u2019s also bloody creepy. 30/40 The Catcher in the Rye, J D Salinger It only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger\u2019s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details \u201cand all that David Copperfield kind of crap\u201d. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose. 31/40 The Big Sleep, Raymond Chandler Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her \u201clittle sharp predatory teeth\u201d and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men. 32/40 Vanity Fair, William Makepeace Thackeray All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray\u2019s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature\u2019s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she\u2019s all the more compelling for that. 33/40 The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book\u2019s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar \u2013 used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments \u2013 struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel\u2019s publication in 1963. 34/40 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl Harry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka\u2019s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl\u2019s startling work of fantasy. 35/40 Anna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy Andrew Davies\u2019s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can\u2019t quite face returning to the novel\u2019s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina \u2013 enormous, too! \u2013the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society\u2019s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. 36/40 Dangerous Liaisons, Pierre Choderlos de Laclos The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise\u2019s justification for her behaviour \u2013 \u201cI, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours\u201d \u2013 will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos\u2019s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 37/40 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez The energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez\u2019s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez\u2019s magical realism unique. 38/40 The Trial, Frank Kafka \u201cSomeone must have been telling lies about Josef K\u2026\u201d So begins Kafka\u2019s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they\u2019re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it\u2019s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance. 39/40 Rebecca, Daphne du Maurier The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier\u2019s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. 40/40 The Leopard, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa\u2019s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi\u2019s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It\u2019s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.\n\nShe thought she was getting lunch with Lee Child. It said so on the list of auction items. Plane tickets to New York. Three nights in the Roosevelt Hotel on 45th Street. And lunch with Lee Child. No mention of a character\u2019s name, so far as she knew. There had been a breakdown in communication. I knew all about it back in February. As did Lee. We discussed it. Don\u2019t worry, Lee had said. He would find her something to do. \u201cSomething poignant. Then she dies. Short and sweet.\u201d\n\nTo set the record straight, even if everyone else thought otherwise, Lydia never knew what she was getting in return for her immensely generous contribution to the Heart Foundation. And then, after all those umpteen trillions of choices had been made, and the book existed, she found out, over lunch with this \u201cprince among writers\u201d (Lydia\u2019s words) in New York. I am in your book!? She opened it with mingled excitement and trepidation. What would her character be like? Would she be young or old, ugly or beautiful? Would she step out with Jack Reacher or get taken out by him? \u201cOh, God,\u201d she blurted out when a particularly unpleasant woman made an appearance, nameless at first. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not her!\u201d She wasn\u2019t.\n\nShe was glad too that she wasn\u2019t Chang. Obviously, Chang was Chang. Child had saved Lydia Lair up for the part of...Lydia Lair. In the home invasion scene. Lydia, her husband Evan, the daughter, her pre-wedding party, all thoroughly smothered, like a waffle in maple syrup, with assorted bad guys and guns and Reacher and Chang.\n\n\u201cThat really was me,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it had been Chang, it would have just been a name, it wouldn\u2019t have been me.\u201d She was completely caught up in it. Heart rate ticking up every time the name Evan came up. \u201cDr and Mrs Evan Lair.\u201d Pictured at a charity ball, moreover. She had been reading that bit on the plane home. She had to put the book down, she was too emotional. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe this,\u201d she said to her husband, the one who was not called Evan, when she got back to San Antonio. It was like Child was allowing her to live the life she might have led.\n\nEvan Lair, in the story, was a doctor (of the medical kind). Evan, Lydia\u2019s Evan, had been studying medicine when he was killed in the car crash. Straight A student. She was studying French at Euphoria State, and they had met through singing in the choir. They were both great believers, brought up in the Methodist church, and Evan had thought about becoming a missionary. They were engaged to be married. Then he went and died in April. Aged 22.\n\nOn the eve of his death, Lydia had had a terrible premonition. A feeling of agony took possession of her. She was sobbing. Nothing like it had ever happened to her before. \u201cI\u2019m afraid if you leave me tomorrow then I may never see you again,\u201d she said. \u201cHow could that be?\u201d (Evan). \u201cBecause you would be dead,\u201d (Lydia). \u201cAnd then I would live forever,\u201d he replied, evenly, quite unperturbed. \u201cI would be with God, so there is nothing to fear, is there?\u201d\n\nHe had calmed her down with quotations from the Bible, reassuring her of their eternal life together, whether on earth or in heaven. And she had believed him. Didn\u2019t give it another thought. Then came the knock at her door at 2am. A minister of the church, knocking at 2am. Evan was dead. His car had hit a bridge as he drove home in the darkness. It was all her fault, she felt.\n\n\n\nAnd now Evan, in Make Me, thanks to the divine intervention of the omniscient author, was alive once more. The apprentice medic and missionary had attained eternal life after all, at least for a few glorious pages. (\u201cHow did he choose the name Evan?\u201d she asked me. \u201cHe needed two syllables,\u201d I said, uselessly. \u201cBut,\u201d Lydia again, \u201cwhy those two?\u201d) How could I (or anyone else) account for these correspondences? Coincidence? Fate? Miracle? It was all entirely uncanny and utterly entrancing for her.\n\nBut it was the story of the brother that just about finished her off. Lydia Lair\u2019s brother had gone missing \u2013 such was the premise of Make Me \u2013 and Reacher and Chang and Westwood were trying to figure out what had become of him. Which, in a way, was equally true of Lydia Lair. Having by this time read the book, she found that she had to reconsider. What, after all, had become of her brother?\n\nIt was after lunch. Her husband and his test-pilot friend Art had gone out somewhere. We were alone, seated comfortably in her living room, next to the grand piano, deep in upholstery and cushions. A quiet, spacious house, a tree-lined garden, walls decorated with paintings, many of them by her husband. She wanted me to explain how Lee had come up with all his ideas about the \u201cassisted dying\u201d and all the poor devils who went to Mother\u2019s Rest to die.\n\nShe wanted to tell me about her brother. The tragic brother. But first of all, for some reason, she revisited the suicide of her ex-husband. He was a lawyer, specialising in the oil and gas industry. They had kept on moving around, from Albuquerque to Dallas to San Antonio. And then he had to go back to Dallas. \u201cI\u2019m staying here,\u201d she said. She liked it in San Antonio; their kids were happy at school. He could go to Dallas on his own.\n\n\n\nSix months later they had divorced. Her ex-husband remarried, but in a year or so he was dead. His second wife killed herself first. In a garage, car engine running, door locked. Exactly three weeks and one day later, he died in exactly the same way. Garage, engine, door. He was an ex-ex-husband. Found lying by the door, not sitting serenely in the driver\u2019s seat, perhaps having had second thoughts, trying to get out and failing. He had told his children that there was no way he would ever commit suicide, so they were not to worry.\n\n\n\nSix months later they had divorced. Her ex-husband remarried but in a year or so he was dead. His second wife killed herself first. In a garage, car engine running, door locked. Exactly three weeks and one day later, he died in exactly the same way\n\nLiar! Lydia had read his journal, after he was gone. Like a good lawyer, he had done his research. If the spouse committed suicide within three weeks of his partner, then any life insurance was null and void. He had left it precisely one day more than the three-week waiting period. Looked as though he was impatient to be gone. Only really waited so his kids would collect. The ending was nailed on. Carefully scripted. It was just a question of timing.\n\nIt had taken Lydia, unlike her first husband, years before she was ready to remarry. So when Jean-Pierre came along, Lydia told him to go away and leave her alone and never to call her. He duly went back to Paris. Adieu! Then nine months later she called him. She was in the south of France.\n\nBut, as I say, it was all about the brother for her. Whenever the question of the mysteriously missing brother came up in the book, she was torn apart. Again and again. Her reading was bliss, and it was torture. In the Kansas that was not in Lee Child\u2019s head, her brother, Duke, had died only three months before. \u201cIn a tragic accident on his farm,\u201d as she had written. Maybe she even believed it then. For a while. She wanted to believe it. But Child wouldn\u2019t let her. Make Me told her everything about her brother. On the one hand, Child was giving her Evan back again; on the other, he was taking away her brother, once and for all. It was fair. She needed to know what had happened. And now she did.\n\n\n\nShe had told me about the \u201caccident\u201d on our walk along the river. Duke had been repairing one of his vehicles in a shed by the wheat field. A big heavy vehicle, a grain feeder. He was fixing the hydraulics, which had a habit of failing. The front part of the vehicle had to be craned up so Duke could slide underneath it and get access. And it was supposed to be supported on blocks so that it couldn\u2019t in any circumstances flop down and squash anyone who happened to be underneath. But Duke had done it \u201ca gazillion times\u201d before, and he was confident. He didn\u2019t bother with the stupid blocks. Inevitably, the engine had collapsed right on top of him and crushed the life out of him. Like he had been stomped on by a giant hoof from above. Aged just 58.\n\n\n\nLydia had been given the job of phoning around all her sisters (there were seven children, six girls and just the one brother, the youngest). It was a \u201cfreak occurrence\u201d of the kind that happen on farms all the time: people died in grain elevators, for example (just like the ones in Make Me, \u201cas big as an apartment building\u201d), drowning in wheat. Chopped up into tiny little pieces in giant shredders. Turned to pulp in pulping machines. And so on.\n\nBut now we were sitting comfortably, as I say, next to the grand piano. And Lydia changed her story. I wasn\u2019t interrogating her, as such, not much anyway, no third degree, no thumb screws. We were just talking. But there was a recurrent theme in the talk of Make Me and mountains in Austria and all that. \u201cI didn\u2019t really put it together before,\u201d she said. \u201cNot until I read the book. And then I started thinking...\u201d\n\nIt was a \u201cfreak occurrence\u201d of the kind that happen on farms all the time: people die in grain elevators, for example, drowning in wheat. Chopped up into tiny little pieces in giant shredders. Turned to pulp in pulping machines. And so on\n\nIt was the phone calls. \u201cI love you for ever and ever,\u201d Duke had said to her. Not the kind of thing her brother would often come out with. She knew he had been down recently. He had started putting weight back on. He was due to go into hospital for surgery, and he didn\u2019t want to go into no goddamn hospital for surgery. Hated doctors, didn\u2019t trust them. And the wheat crop had been pretty much destroyed in a storm. He was in trouble with the bank. But he was always in trouble with the bank. He was a farmer. It was normal.\n\nThat was his last phone call. But it was the other phone calls that really did it. He had phoned all the sisters (she discovered later). A night or two before. Had said he would love them all forever. \u201cHe didn\u2019t call me for two years, and then he called me, and then he died,\u201d said one of her sisters. Or more than one. It was the same thing, over and over again.\n\n\n\nThat \u201caccident\u201d: he was too smart for an accident. And smart enough to stage one too. It wasn\u2019t a suicide, prima facie; but then again, it was. He was calling them all to say goodbye. Almost like a suicide note. \u201cThe last straw was the election.\u201d Duke was a popular guy in town. Perhaps even the most popular. He was always donating stuff to worthy causes. Everybody loved him. He was a happy-go-lucky kind of guy, with a nice wife and son and daughter. He ran for county commissioner. Came in runner-up by about three votes. Laughed about it. Was philosophical about it. Stoical. And then again, maybe he was in fact deeply depressed by it. Felt as if he had been rejected by everyone in the entire community. Betrayed, in a way, after everything he had done for them.\n\nThen he died, flattened like a pancake, under the greasy engine of a grain feeder.\n\nAnd she had understood his last text to her. In March 2015, when Child was approaching the climax of Make Me, when Reacher was close to figuring out what had happened to that elusive brother. \u201cLydia, what are your plans for next week?\u201d Her plans didn\u2019t include her only brother\u2019s funeral. Lydia showed me some pictures of him. Grinning at the camera. Cheekily. Arms around his family. A little overweight, maybe, but he carried it well. He looked cheerful enough. Maybe a little too cheerful?\n\nAnd now she realised, there were other farmers out there, killing themselves. The shotgun to the head. The horse tranquillizer. \u201cHow can you live?\u201d she said, with an air of desperation. \u201cThere are no jobs.\u201d It was pure Make Me. Make Me was the story of Lydia\u2019s life. With a few twists. But it was all there. \u201cWhen I read the book,\u201d she said, \u201cI realised: THIS WAS MY BROTHER!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat Child must have googled you!\u201d said her sceptical aunt over the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way.\u201d\n\nI knew he hadn\u2019t. He hated to google anything. Preferred to rely on a Velcro memory or sheer blissful ignorance. He knew only two things about her, technically speaking: \u201cLydia\u201d and \u201cLair,\u201d in that order. A handful of phonemes. No more. Didn\u2019t have a clue about her, beyond that. Had no idea where she came from or who she was, least of all who her brother was. Or Evan. Or anyone else. And then he had just gone right ahead and written the story of her life (with a few minor deviations). He had done a Cuvier and reassembled the whole creature out of a mere heel bone of a name.\n\nLydia knew her aunt was wrong. How many Lydia Lairs were there? And even if you zeroed in on the right one, there was never going to be that amount of information about all the other people in her life. The unus mundus Jung liked to call it. Mysterium coniunctionis, recalling the mystic fusions of the old alchemists.\n\n\n\nll those unfathomable connections that went beyond time and space at the level of the collective unconscious. Like wormholes in space, providing a shortcut from one distant galaxy to another. Weaving in and out of black holes. Synchronicity. That non-Cartesian realm in which waffle calls unto waffle across the miles like stranded whales, beached upon foreign shores.\n\n\n\nOr maybe like the mosaics that Lydia Lair herself liked to create , sticking together disparate fragments, broken shards, to form some kind of pattern. Lydia Lair had been a cheerleader, a bassoonist, a mother, and a businesswoman. She was a fan of Andy Williams, Tony Bennett, Neil Diamond and Barry Manilow. And she had always been strong in the faith. \u201cPure honest wholesome unbleached and free from chemicals.\u201d I\u2019d read it in the Guenther Mill, referring to \u201cPioneer Flour.\u201d But you could as easily apply it to Lydia Lair.\n\nWhen she had that lunch with Lee Child, it was not in the least like going to meet her Maker. Or maybe it was. To a degree. He was a Maker, after all. He who knew things about her. Things that nobody ought to know and that he had no right knowing. He was, as he said himself, just a \u201clittle bit omniscient observer here.\u201d He was a god who smoked, admittedly. A packet of Camels a day. \u201cHe is going to die, you know,\u201d said Lydia, with a touch of regret. \u201cTell him that.\u201d\n\nI went out through the garage of their house, where they kept the great invention behind their business success. And it really was great, I\u2019m not kidding. Their original folding ladder. I saw it in action, and I definitely want one too. Basically everyone is going to want one. It used to be called the \u201cAuto-Lad.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow it is known, more prosaically, as The One-Touch Electric Attic Ladder. Retails for around $3,500 or so, and it\u2019s worth every cent. Her idea, designed and built by Jean-Pierre (who apart from being a gifted painter is also an aeronautical engineer). You know all those terrible ladders that come down out of your attic?\n\n\n\nKind of come down, but don\u2019t, not properly. They\u2019re all stiff and useless and awkward. You can\u2019t really work them. They don\u2019t slide. The good news is that they are a thing of the past, thanks to the One-Touch. Press a button and it\u2019s like grace descending. The staircase folds down out of the ceiling. All controlled by a computer, not sensors. It\u2019s like a dream.\n\nAnd you climb up it with total confidence. Broad steps with excellent grip. You don\u2019t climb, you ascend. Like an electric stairway to heaven.\n\nThis article was a collaboration with The Iowa Review https://iowareview.org.
