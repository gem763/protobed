Photo: Luke Sharrett/Getty Images\n\nThe rifle used by a Texas man to carry out a horrific two-city mass shooting last weekend was purchased in a private transaction, allowing him to evade the FBI background check that had previously stopped him from buying a gun, according to the Associated Press.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Texas Department of Public Safety said in a statement that Seth Ator was prevented from purchasing a gun in January of 2014 for an undisclosed reason. But a law enforcement official told the AP the 36-year-old was turned down for a \u201cmental health issue.\u201d\n\nAtor\u2019s ability to turn to the private market and buy the gun he wasn\u2019t able to get from a licensed gun dealer has caught the attention of many in Washington, especially the Democrats who\u2019ve been clamoring for the passage of universal-background-check legislation. As House Democrat Adam Schiff asked on Twitter, \u201cCould there be a more compelling case for why we need universal background checks?\u201d\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t think so, and so they\u2019re pushing harder for the passage of their bill, which would require background checks on all gun transactions. The bill passed the House in February and has sat on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s desk ever since. The Texas shooting is increasing pressure on McConnell to take up the legislation, though it\u2019s unlikely if that pressure will come from anyone McConnell will listen to.\n\nIn the likely-to-be-ignored camp is the Washington Post, which published Wednesday a full-page op-ed listing the names of hundreds of mass shooting victims and imploring McConnell to \u201cdo something.\u201d Don\u2019t expect McConnell to listen to Everytown for Gun Safety president John Feinblatt either. In a statement this week, Feinblatt called Ator\u2019s ability to buy a gun \u201cexhibit A of the deadliness of the background check loophole. This weekend alone, seven Americans are dead after a preventable mass shooting, because the Senate has refused to require background checks on all gun sales.\u201d And there\u2019s no chance McConnell cared that Chuck Schumer said this week, \u201cIf the House-passed background checks bill would have been signed into law, this tragedy could have been avoided. Leader McConnell \u2014 you have no excuse.\u201d\n\nSo who is McConnell waiting to hear from? President Trump. On Tuesday, the Kentucky senator said he\u2019ll allow a vote on the House bill if Trump signals his support for it. That\u2019s unlikely.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s position on the issue has flip-flopped in the aftermath of recent mass shootings, on Sunday he came out firmly against background checks. \u201cFor the most part, as strong as you make your background checks, they would not have stopped any of it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a big problem. It\u2019s a mental problem.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s quite a departure from last month when, in the days following the mass shootings in Ohio and Texas, Trump seemed to endorse stronger background checks. \u201cThere\u2019s a great appetite \u2014 and I mean a very strong appetite licensed gun for background checks,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think we can bring up background checks like we\u2019ve never had before.\u201d\n\nHe reversed course within weeks, citing the \u201cvery, very strong background checks\u201d already in place. Now Trump and his administration are talking about measures such as expedited executions for convicted mass shooters and what Trump called \u201csubstantial reforms to our nation\u2019s broken mental health system.\u201d The White House is reportedly planning to release a piecemeal package of gun measures next week. Don\u2019t expect expanded background checks to be among them.", "description": "A House bill expanding background checks could have stopped the Texas shooter from buying a gun.
