REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed\n\nA total of 25 drones and missiles were launched at two oil plants in last weekend\u2019s strikes, including Iranian Delta Wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and \u201cYa Ali\u201d cruise missiles, Defence Ministry spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said.\n\n\u201cThe attack was launched from the north and unquestionably sponsored by Iran,\u201d he told a news conference. \u201cThe evidence ... that you have seen in front of you, makes this undeniable.\u201d\n\nAuthorities were still working to determine the exact launch point, Malki said, repeatedly declining to answer reporters questions about whether Iran actually carried out the attack.\n\nIran has denied any involvement in the assault that initially halved Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production. An adviser to Iran\u2019s president tweeted that the press conference proved Saudi Arabia \u201cknows nothing\u201d.\n\nYemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which has been battling a Saudi-led military coalition, has claimed responsibility for the strikes.\n\nOn Wednesday, the group gave details of the type of drones it said were used in the Sept. 14 attack and warned that the United Arab Emirates was also in its sights.\n\nMalki reiterated that the attack could not have come from Yemen, south of Saudi Arabia, and that the Houthis were \u201ccovering up\u201d for Iran.\n\n\u201cThe precision impact of the cruise missile indicate advanced capability beyond Iran proxy capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe targeting direction of the site indicate north to south direction of travel.\u201d\n\nEighteen drones and three missiles were launched at Abqaiq, home to the world\u2019s largest oil processing facility, but the missiles \u201cfell short\u201d, Malki said. He said four missiles targeted Khurais, adding that the Ya Ali missiles have a range of 700 km and have been used by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards.\n\nHOUTHIS THREATEN UAE\n\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Saria reiterated that the movement had carried out the strike, saying it possessed new drones, powered by normal and jet engines, that could reach targets deep inside the \u201cenemy\u201d.\n\nThe group had launched \u201cSamad 3\u201d, \u201cQassef 3\u201d, jet-powered and other drones, including some carrying bombs, at the Saudi oil plants from three sites, he said in a televised speech.\n\n\u201cToday and for the first time we announce that we have dozens of targets within our range in the UAE, some are in Abu Dhabi and can be attacked at any time,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Western-backed, Sunni Muslim coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 against the Houthis after they ousted the internationally recognised government from power in the capital Sanaa in late 2014.\n\nThe UAE in June scaled down its military presence in Yemen as Western allies pressed for an end to the ruinous war and as rising tensions with Iran raised fears of a war in the Gulf.\n\nThe Yemen conflict, seen as proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has killed tens of thousands and pushed millions to the brink of famine in the poorest Arabian Peninsula nation.", "description": "Saudi Arabia on Wednesday displayed remnants of what it described as Iranian drones and cruise missiles used in an attack on Saudi oil facilities, saying they were \"undeniable\" evidence of Iranian aggression.", "authors": ["Nael Shyoukhi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431303204&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1JI", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
