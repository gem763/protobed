That workload matched Scherzer's from Game 1 and represented one more out than Zack Greinke recorded in Game 3.\n\nAnd it was not just the unexpected length, it was the quality. Urquidy allowed only a single to Anthony Rendon and a double to Yan Gomes while striking out four and generally kept Washington's line-up off balance across the board, retiring the last nine hitters he faced.\n\nA.J. Hinch undoubtedly walked into the dugout before Game 4 ready to go to his bullpen early and often, but Urquidy's heroics rendered that unnecessary and could pay off for the Houston relief corps in Game 5 and beyond.\n\nBregman is back\n\nIt is no secret the Astros have ridden their pitching to this point in the postseason, with their offense doing just enough to get by.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlex Bregman's struggles at the plate had been a big reason for that. While the American League MVP candidate had at least one hit in each of the five Division Series games against the Tampa Bay Rays, he entered Game 4 in a four-for-31 drought (.129) in the ALCS and World Series.\n\nBut Bregman broke out in a big way Saturday, with his first-inning single driving in the Astros' first run and his seventh-inning grand slam off Fernando Rodney serving as the dagger that evened the series. He added a lined single to left in the eighth to cap off a bounceback game.\n\nThe last thing the Nationals wanted to see was Bregman in a groove, and it certainly appears he is finding his way back into one now.\n\nWe're in for quite a finish\n\nGiven the abundance of talent on the Houston roster, most of which were around for the run to the title two years ago, not many counted the Astros out after they became the first team in 20 years to drop the first two games of the World Series at home.\n\nNow that they have maintained the road team's perfect record in the series, we are set up for what should be a fascinating best-of-three to determine a champion.\n\nIt is difficult to dream up better pitching matchups than Cole v Scherzer and Justin Verlander v Stephen Strasburg in the next two games, even if none of that quartet turned in a vintage outing in his first start of the series. Should things get to a Game 7, the Astros certainly would be favoured at home with Greinke on the mound, but we have a long way to go before we get to that point.\n\nIn the meantime, the Nationals will have to find a way to get their bats heated up again after going one for 19 with runners in scoring position in their two home games. But simply getting runners to second and third figures to be awfully difficult with Cole and Verlander in the way.", "description": "Jose Urquidy and Alex Bregman led the way in a Houston blowout that evened the series on Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/y_Gp3NKJiCFrV7Dc90DoIg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0Ub_KCS4L_jkDieAbvPSNQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/9fc327bb41801112ef347863d0d67925", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
