In the stands above, father Paul and mother Kristi were overwhelmed and elated and proud, slightly amazed by what Regan had just done. The kid from Lakeville, Minnesota, had been an extraordinary swimmer for years \u2014 good enough to be the youngest member of the United States team for this World Championship meet \u2014 but this was a new level of excellence.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nFreshly crowned as the fastest female backstroker in history, the machinery of sudden fame lurched into motion and scooped up Regan\u2019s parents. Within minutes of setting the record, USA Swimming officials made their way to them in the stands for a brief consultation. They exchanged contact information, scheduled a meeting, started laying plans for this real-time transformation from aquatic prodigy to 2020 Olympic gold-medal favorite.\n\nTwo nights later, Smith would also set the world record in the 100 backstroke while leading off what would be a world-record performance by the American 400 medley relay. Two swims, three world records, welcome to international swimming stardom. She will be one of the fresh faces seen often in the buildup to Tokyo next summer.\n\nBack home in America after that burst of brilliance, here came the inducement offers and encouragement to turn professional. Here came the hard sell.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of attention, a lot of people coming at us,\u201d Paul Smith said. \u201cWe got flooded. The conventional wisdom was, \u2018You are an idiot if you don\u2019t go pro. You\u2019re looking at several million dollars.\u2019\u201d\n\nConventional wisdom met an established conflict: Regan Smith had already committed to swim at Stanford, her dream school, after graduating from high school in 2020. She was born in the Bay Area, where Paul had worked in the tech industry, and valued both the elite education and elite swim program at the school. But then the discussion of potential life-altering money entered the picture, presenting the dilemma.\n\nShe could turn pro, or she could swim collegiately. She couldn\u2019t do both.\n\nUntil, perhaps, now.\n\nThe freshly implemented California Senate Bill 206, which will allow college athletes in that state to profit off their name, image and likeness, could change Regan\u2019s future. It becomes actionable on Jan. 1, 2023 \u2014 though at the rate which other states are looking to fast-track similar legislation, California could wind up being pre-empted on its own pioneering legislation.\n\nRegan Smith of the U.S. reacts after winning the women's 200m backstroke final at the 18th FINA world swimming championships in South Korea in July. (Reuters)\n\nIt is a game-changing law that should accelerate the NCAA\u2019s acceptance of something other than staunch amateurism as its guiding principle. It could allow the Regan Smiths of the world \u2014 the best teenage athletes who will be entering college in the coming years \u2014 to both be paid for their prowess and remain college athletes.\n\nThe vast majority of the focus \u2014 and the available endorsement money \u2014 created by the \u201cFair Pay To Play Act\u201d will be centered on football and men\u2019s basketball. That\u2019s understood. But there are elite athletes in non-revenue sports who will also be marketable, to the great benefit of the NCAA as a whole and the American Olympic movement.\n\nThe power brokers in college sports are busy propagating scare tactics about the damage that will be done by this legislation. The Pac-12 conference issued a statement that included a start prediction that the bill \u201cwill likely reduce resources and opportunities for student-athletes in Olympic sports and have a negative disparate impact on female student-athletes.\u201d\n\nAs colleague Dan Wetzel pointed out in a column earlier this week, any reduction in female athletic opportunities would only prove that administrators care less about female athletics than male athletics. They set the priorities and the budgets. Perhaps they should look at their own bloated staffs as a potential place to cut if NIL legalization impacts the bottom line. (Important to note \u2014 and repeat, over and over \u2014 that money going to athletes for endorsements would not come directly from the colleges themselves.)\n\nFact is, NCAA amateurism rules have long had a negative impact on Olympic sports. They sent household names like Katie Ledecky and Franklin out of college early and into the pro ranks. Other teen stars, like Michael Phelps and gymnast Simone Biles, both bypassed college competition because their earning potential during those years would have been wasted. Soccer players Lindsey Horan and Mallory Pugh of the World Cup-winning U.S. women\u2019s national team skipped college to play professionally overseas.\n\nThink of the publicity they could have generated for attention-starved non-revenue sports. You don\u2019t think more people would have bought tickets or tuned into broadcasts to see established Olympic megastars like Phelps swim for Michigan or Biles bounce for UCLA? Phelps trained with the college team in Ann Arbor but never competed for the Wolverines. Biles committed to the Bruins but never wore a powder-blue leotard.\n\nAs for Regan Smith and her dilemma: The family did its homework on her earning potential. Fact is, the \u201cseveral million dollars\u201d being discussed probably wouldn\u2019t materialize pre-Tokyo. Most of the big-dollar, mainstream marketing Olympic deals \u2014 companies like Toyota and Visa and MinuteMaid \u2014 were locked up before Smith blew up.\n\nThe swimsuit industry was still ready to throw at least six figures Smith\u2019s way, with the potential for other side deals. In swimming terms, she became an A-List client to pursue. But as Paul Smith put it, \u201cIt\u2019s not Peyton Manning we\u2019re talking about. We understand that.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the Smiths say they will stay the amateur course for now. The Ledecky Plan looks like a viable alternative: two years of collegiate swimming at Stanford, then turn pro two years ahead of the 2024 Olympics while staying in training with Cardinal coach Greg Meehan in Palo Alto.\n\nIf NCAA rules (or California law) change prior to Smith turning pro, they will weigh endorsement opportunities warily. Anything that takes away from a focus on swimming is not something the family is eager to embrace.\n\nWhat they will continue to fight for, however, is prize money that has been withheld from Regan by NCAA rules. A lot of it. She earned about $140,000 from her World Championship performances \u2014 including $67,500 in world-record bonuses \u2014 and only got to keep about $41,000. The other $100,000 is locked up on the wrong side of the NCAA blockade.\n\n\u201cWhat she did in Korea has absolutely nothing to do with college swimming,\u201d said Paul Smith, who currently is the program director for Regan\u2019s club team, Riptide Aquatics in Apple Valley. \u201cI bemoan nothing, but intellectually, I don\u2019t understand not being able to accept a world-record bonus. It leaves kind of a bitter taste.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Regan Smith will continue training toward Tokyo and her family will continue turning down prize money and avoiding endorsements, per NCAA bylaws. They will turn down lucrative offers for private swim lessons from people in the Minneapolis area. They will painstakingly track all her meet expenses and seek reimbursement for those from USA Swimming \u2014 a plane flight here, a meal there \u2014 while waiting for a day when the best backstroker in the history of the planet can be fully rewarded financially for her greatness.\n\nRules are rules, until they aren\u2019t. A better day for college athletes is on the way \u2014 and not just football and men\u2019s basketball players. The best in the Olympic sports should profit as well.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "A better day for college athletes is on the way \u2014 and not just football and men\u2019s basketball players.
