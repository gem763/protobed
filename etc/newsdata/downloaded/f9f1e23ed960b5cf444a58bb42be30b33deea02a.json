The school also has a building with the Mallett name on it.\n\nBy Monday, she had lawyered up with well-known defence attorney William Booth.\n\nThere was almost no trace of her left on the internet, apart from a message of congratulations from the school regarding her wedding last year.\n\nThe Western Province Water Polo Association also told News24 she had resigned as the body's manager.\n\nBooth told News24 Viotti did not have a disciplinary hearing before she left, and that no criminal charges had been laid.\n\nHis job is to help her and family during the school's investigation, but an unexpected development shifted his focus.\n\nLewd videos purporting to be of the teacher were doing the rounds rapidly, with one landing on a well-known porn site (and has subsequently been taken down).\n\nBooth added that speculation and inaccuracies were being reported but would not go into details.\n\nMultiple parents of former pupils told News24 of their disbelief this week.\n\n\"Fiona was my one son's history teacher for two years... She was a very sweet girl so we are all very shocked to hear what had been happening,\" one parent said.\n\nThe pupil's family, meanwhile, also appointed a lawyer who was approached with a request for an interview. \"I can't comment, sorry,\" the lawyer said by WhatsApp.\n\nThe Old Diocesan's Union's representative Antony Taylor, better known as Darren Nudelman in the series Tali's Wedding, also did not want to comment.\n\nThe school's investigation would be led by attorney Graeme Dorrington and senior advocate Francois van Zyl, the Weekend Argus reported.\n\nWhat is Bishops?\n\nThe school was founded by Anglican bishops in 1849 by Bishop Robert Gray. \"Its object was 'to give a sound education to the youth of the colony', conducted on the principles of the English [Anglican] Church,\" the school's website says.\n\nIts ethos has changed to one of preparing \"well-rounded\" boys for the world.\n\nThis year's matric tuition costs an eye-watering R259 620, (R5 452 discount if it is paid in full up front). There is also a capital levy per family of R1 500 per term.\n\nParents can put their boys on a waiting list when they are born for a fee of R550. This year's non-refundable acceptance fee if a place is offered, ranges from R25 000 to R27 500. There is also a R26 000 fee for foreign families who want their son placed in a boarding house.\n\nBoys also have to go through interviews, and, when they are older entrance exams to secure a place. So getting in, and staying in, was not a doddle for the 140 boys writing matric this year.\n\nSporting fixtures between Bishops and other private schools are also keenly followed, and one of its most famous old boys is household name Raymond Ackerman of Pick n Pay fame. Springbok Francois Louw, playing in Japan on Sunday, is also an old boy.\n\nDoes it matter that the pupil is 18? Can't he do what he likes?\n\nA debate raged on social media over whether there was anything wrong with an 18-year-old and a 30-year-old being in a relationship. The marriage of French President Emmanuel Macron to Brigitte Trogneux was cited as an example. The two met when he was at school and she was his drama teacher.\n\nThe teacher had become an object of desire to some, while the boy, a hero to others. Yet many also condemned her alleged actions, and viewed the boy as either a victim or a willing but naive participant.\n\nCentre for Child Law director Karabo Ozah said if a pupil was 18 and gave consent, it was not a crime, unless there was grooming at a younger age.\n\nThe important factor to her is that it allegedly happened in a school context.\n\n\"The teacher being female doesn't matter because she was in a position of power in regard to the child.\"\n\nOzah said in this context pupils who want to break a relationship off, or report sexual activity with a teacher, might delay doing so for fear of being left out of a team, or other repercussions.\n\nShe added they might also be teased if they express concern, with other pupils calling it an \"adventure\" with somebody who is \"so fine\".\n\nRecent Catholic Church scandals showed that men did not speak out when they were boys because they thought nobody would believe them. Studies found that bottling it all up also made them more aggressive in later life.\n\n\"It has to become almost like a scandal that somebody uncovers, for it to come out,\" said Okah.\n\nSo what is the problem if there was no crime?\n\nEducation specialists the SA Council for Education (SACE) warned Parliament earlier in October that it was seeing an emerging trend of misconduct complaints against female teachers by male pupils.\n\nOne of the SACE's functions is to register teachers, and to monitor compliance with its code of ethics.\n\nIt clearly states that no sexual relationship is allowed between pupils and teachers, and nor should there be any \"courting\" of pupils. A violation will lead to a misconduct charge.\n\nOn Friday, the chairperson of Parliament's portfolio committee on basic education said the SACE had called for urgent action in all provinces regarding this trend, which was often facilitated during sports, cultural activities and outings. As far as the committee was concerned, the pupil deserved protection, regardless of his age.\n\n\"He remains a learner and she remains an educator,\" committee chairperson Bongiwe Mbinqo-Gigaba said.\n\nThe portfolio committee on women, youth and persons with disabilities chairperson, Nonhlanhla Ncube-Ndaba, commended the courage of the boy and many other boys who had stepped forward and said \"not in my name, me too\".\n\nBut while all of this was playing out, Booth had another problem: the lewd videos.\n\nIs it a crime to share these videos?\n\nIn September, President Cyril Ramaphosa signed into law the Films and Publications Amendment Act 11 of 2019.\n\nThe act brings film and publication laws further up to date in an online era of fast global distribution of social media networks such as Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\n\nCalled the Revenge Porn Act by some, section 18F states that: \"No person may expose, through any medium, including the internet and social media, a private sexual photograph or film if the disclosure is made without the consent of the individual or individuals who appear in the photograph or film. This also applies if the individual who appears in the photograph or film might have consented to the original creation of such photograph or film.\"\n\nSharing the contents without consent is therefore now a crime.\n\nSocial media expert and lawyer Emma Sandler, who wrote the book Don't film yourself having sex, asked her Twitter users on Friday where they saw Viotti's alleged video, be it a private message, WhatsApp or porn site.\n\nMany of the people who responded said it was shared with them via WhatsApp.\n\nThis law states that the internet service provider must also hand over to the Film and Publications Board or police the information and identity of the person who published it.\n\nThe board has the right to impose its own sanction, or refer cases to the National Prosecuting Authority or institute civil cases if fines issued are not paid.\n\nWhat is the punishment for posting or sharing these clips?\n\nThere are various fines, which can be found HERE:\n\nThose liable for fines and/or prison sentences include those who distribute private sexual material without the person's prior consent, those who distribute such material of a child under 18, and those who are not licenced holders for \"adult premises\".\n\nThe fines range from R300 000 to R750 000 and prison sentences from two to five years.\n\nThe removal of the video from the well-known porn site was surprisingly quick. Its frequently answered questions section offers a form to request a take down with steps to take to assert copyright over the images.\n\nBut by Friday afternoon, Booth said, the video had resurfaced again on another unknown porn site.\n\n\"Anyone who distributes must clearly be told they are committing a crime and will be prosecuted,\" said Booth.\n\n\"Bishops is still busy with its investigation and I do not want to comment on the merits of the case at this stage, however, it is obviously affecting her.\n\n\"As well as her family being dragged into something that they are not involved in or were aware of by the media is wrong and a clear violation of the family members' rights.\"\n\nPassionate alumni\n\nDave Mallett meanwhile sent a letter to parents at the beginning of the week, saying the family was \"devastated\" by the events, but would be \"soldiering on\" to ensure \"business as usual\" at the boarding house.\n\nThe Weekend Argus reported this week that Mallett clarified aspects of his letter at a school meeting on Friday, saying he did not condone his daughter's alleged behaviour.\n\nODU chair Adam Pike said this week that they were passionate alumni and cared for the well-being and reputation of the school. They were though institutionally and legally separate from the school.\n\n\"Accordingly, we expect the school to do all that is necessary to fulfil our expectations. To date, the union is satisfied that the school is pursuing its processes with sufficient vigour,\" he said.\n\n\"I am certain that once the inquiry has run its course, the findings will be studied and treated in the most fitting and appropriate manner,\" Pike said.", "description": "Few would have predicted that a purported relationship between a pupil at Cape Town's elite Bishops boys school and a female teacher would have snowballed into the talking point it has become this week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2869/dd3bbf6fffd74bf9b811181260591bb3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
