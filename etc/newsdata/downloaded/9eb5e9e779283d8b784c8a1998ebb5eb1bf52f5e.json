In Europe, both principles are written into the European Union Constitution. Supporters say the policy is a much-needed legal tool for people, particularly those outside the public eye, to have personal information removed. But critics have argued that its reach has broadened over time and that countries within the European Union are interpreting it differently. They point to examples of the rule\u2019s being used to target news articles. The policy is expanding into areas it wasn\u2019t intended, they add, and is being abused to keep information out of the public domain.\n\nGoogle has successfully argued in court that the rule does not apply globally.\n\nThere\u2019s some really embarrassing stuff out there: bad usernames, unflattering photos. The podcast Reply All got into some of those cases.\n\nBut for some, it\u2019s way more personal. Things like criminal records and revenge porn might seriously affect future job prospects or other major life plans.\n\nSome American newsrooms, like cleveland.com, are now offering readers ways to change \u2014 or erase \u2014 what\u2019s previously been published about them.\n\nWe unpack the rights and wrongs of making what\u2019s public, private.\n\nProduced by Avery Kleinman.", "description": "Speak Freely", "authors": ["Philippe Lopez Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://s20352.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-886070296.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
