(She\u2019s rocked some pink hair in a sponcon ad to match her meal replacement shake, but that was just a one-time thing.) That said, today is a new day, and Khlo\u00e9 just debuted a new chocolate brunette look that will remind you of the early days of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\n\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s hard to remember the last time Khlo\u00e9 was a brunette. I attempted to scroll through her IG to see, but I gave up after the fifth \u201cboxer braids\u201d post of 2016\u2014it\u2019s been that long!

Here she is posing with her sisters Kim and Kourtney Kardashian to promote the new perfumes they each created for KKW Fragrance:\n\nAnother look at those bouncy curls for good measure:\n\nAnnouncing the @kkwfragrance Diamonds Collection by Kourtney x Kim x Khlo\u00e9!!! It\u2019s the first fragrance collaboration I\u2019ve done with Kourtney and Khloe for my line. Each of the fragrances really capture us individually.

I wanted to create a fragrance that feels feminine, sexy, and strong when I wear it.\u201d Lovely!\n\nThe new collection drops November 8. In the meantime, I will be taking this photo to the nearest hair salon that will agree to dye my hair on a whim!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "I need to know what this exact shade is called!! \ud83d\udc81\u2640\ufe0f", "authors": ["Shannon Barbour"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7D94M3hbuX_malnZifKRWg--~B/aD01NDQ7dz0xMDg0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/3efeb5ca5cab7d8c6ab1364bd79316f1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
