His life and death motivated Indigenous activists to push the federal government to pass Jordan's Principle, a law meant to ensure that Indigenous children get equal access to healthcare and other services.\n\nJordan River Anderson, The Messenger by Abenaki filmmaker Alanis Obsomawin premieres this week at the Toronto International Film Festival. (Submitted by TIFF)\n\nObomsawin spoke to The Current's interim host Laura Lynch about how her own childhood experiences inspired her to make films about the challenges facing Indigenous people in Canada. Here is part of their conversation.\n\nWhat kind of emotional journey is it for you when you immerse yourself in stories like this one?\n\nWell nothing is easy, but I feel so strong about it, and I know I'm here because I'm one of those [children]. I wasn't a child with special needs, but I was certainly a child once, and I wasn't treated right at all.\n\nAnd this is why I revolt, especially against the educational system. For so many decades ... the history of Canada that they taught in the classroom officially, these books were written by the church. And then ... here I am, an \"Indian.\" Like they said, Christopher Columbus who was lost, thought he was in India and the named stayed, became official.\n\nWell, you sit in the classroom and you are the only one that's \"Indian,\" and you hear, \"Oh, the savages. They really were so mean to the poor white people who came here, and they scalped them, and this language is Satan's language.\"\n\nThis is how I was raised. This is what I heard in the classroom every day. I got beaten up so many times, until I started beating back.\n\nBeaten up by who?\n\nBy children. By other children. You know, if you're in the classroom and the whole classroom is all white, and the teacher is saying how bad our people are, what do you think happens when you come out of the classroom? They're waiting for you. I didn't always know which corner, but I knew that they were going to be there.\n\nAnd this is why I care so much for children. And people tell me, \"Alanis, why are you so good to children? They beat you up.\" Yes, but they weren't born thinking that way.\n\nIt's their parents and it's the adults who taught them that. And it's the teachers in the classroom that made sure that these other children could feel superior to me. I was just a savage.\n\nAnd [I asked myself], how can this change? And my answer was that children have to hear another story.\n\nAnd that's how I started to sing and talk about the history and tell stories. I [toured] hundreds and hundreds of schools in this country.\n\nAnd I won. I was right.\n\nBecause now we are at a time, I think, across the country, [when] Canadians want to hear the real story of this country. \"What's the history?\" They want to know the real thing. They want to know what happened.\n\nAnd I think, in general, Canadians want to see justice done. And so it's a very different time.\n\nEspecially the last five years with the reconciliation, [that] has done an awful lot of work and applied these changes that should have been made. And so what's happening now, never happened before.\n\nYou have a feeling Canadians are really listening to you now. Where 10 years ago they'd say, \"Ah, the Indians, they're always complaining,\" and, \"Oh, they're drunks,\" \"Oh, they're lazy,\" \u2014 this is the language that we heard. Now it's different.\n\nAnd our people in court are being respected. And the treaties that .. tricked ... our people ... stole the lands, stole everything that has to do with natural resources. When you go to court now about a treaty it's a very different story.\n\nAnd in a lot of cases some justice is coming. Some land is going back [to Indigenous people] and some money is going back. And I'm so glad I've lived this long, to see the difference.\n\nSo, Alanis Obomsawin, at this age, are you hopeful?\n\nIt's more than hopeful. It's much more profound.\n\nI like to listen to our people. I listen for hours before I come in with a crew [to film]. To really understand. It's about a life. And for me life is sacred.\n\nAnd the older the people are that talk to me, I'm always first of all wondering, how did they survive? Like what was it like? So [how they have survived is] just amazing. I find our people so beautiful. It's just that they don't know how beautiful they are.\n\nWritten by Allie Jaynes.
