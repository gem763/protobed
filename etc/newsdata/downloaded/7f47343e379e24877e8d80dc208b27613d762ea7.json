They agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal,\u201d the pair said in a joint statement.\n\nMarket participants saw the statement as surprisingly confident, and some felt it could be pointing to a real chance that a no-deal Brexit, the nemesis of financial markets, could yet be avoided.\n\n\u201cThe announcement is decidedly upbeat in its tone and while it stops well short of suggesting a deal is imminent it has been warmly welcomed in the markets,\u201d said David Cheetham at XTB.com.\n\nBut BK Asset Management\u2019s Kathy Lien, citing a Sky News report that said British officials were proposing a narrow free-trade agreement with the EU, cautioned that the pound remained vulnerable.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re skeptical that the EU will find any agreement palatable but investors are latching onto any piece of good news as the price action reflects a great degree of optimism,\u201d Lien said.\n\n\u201cOf course, sentiment could shift quickly if Germany or the EU casts doubt on a deal so its unadvisable to rush into any major positions before a firm outcome is known.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Key figures around 2040 GMT \u2013\n\nNew York \u2013 Dow: UP 0.6 percent at 26,496.67 (close)\n\nNew York \u2013 S&P 500: UP 0.6 percent at 2,938.13 (close)\n\nNew York \u2013 Nasdaq: UP 0.6 percent at 7,950.78 (close)\n\nLondon \u2013 FTSE 100: UP 0.3 percent at 7,186.36 (close)\n\nParis \u2013 CAC 40: UP 1.3 percent at 5,569.05 (close)\n\nFrankfurt \u2013 DAX 30: UP 0.6 percent at 12,164.20 (close)\n\nEURO STOXX 50: UP 0.9 percent at 3,493.96 (close)\n\nTokyo \u2013 Nikkei 225: UP 0.5 percent at 21,551.98 (close)\n\nHong Kong \u2013 Hang Seng: UP 0.1 percent at 25,707.93 (close)\n\nShanghai \u2013 Composite: UP 0.8 percent at 2,947.71 (close)\n\nEuro/dollar: UP at $1.1006 from $1.0971 at 2100 GMT\n\nDollar/yen: UP at 107.88 yen from 107.48 yen\n\nPound/dollar: UP at $1.2440 from $1.2206\n\nEuro/pound: DOWN at 89.56 pence from 89.89 pence\n\nBrent North Sea crude: UP 1.3 percent at $59.10 per barrel\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: UP 1.8 percent at $53.55 per barrel\n\nburs-jmb", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 Global stocks mostly rose Thursday on hopes for progress in the US-China trade dispute, while the British pound jumped on optimism", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/2358b3_if-markets-are-suddenly-fantasizing-us-china-trade-deal-equity-markets-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
