You'd think it would be a good time for the the Hong Kong-born rapper, singer, and dancer to take a break, but no. \"Rest is not part of my vocabulary. I\u2019m always here, any time of the day or the night,\" he says.\n\nOver the past five years, Jackson has split his time between Korea and China. He has been in dozens of music videos and TV shows, released eight singles as a solo artist, and launched his Team Wang recording label. As member of the boy band GOT7, he\u2019s released over 10 EPs and albums, and embarked on three world tours. Still, with everything he's done, Jackson is just now sharing his truest and deepest feelings on Mirrors.\n\n\u201cFor this album I actually found my true identity. I\u2019ve released a lot of rap songs in the past; In China I release many ballads and R&B songs, so it just came to a conclusion where I felt like the fusion of it all was me,\u201d he says.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what this album covers, from talking about love and running out of time, to the achievements he\u2019s proud of and where he is right now in life. Jackson is unmasking himself and letting the world see another side to the bright-shining personality it's used to (like in the \u201cJackson Wang Annyeonghaseyo\u201d video). \u201cI feel very lucky I found myself\u2026 or I think I did, not sure yet. But at this moment, I think I found myself. This is the true \u2018me\u2019 you\u2019re seeing,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile at first listen you could think most of the songs on the album are about a romantic kind of love, Jackson explains the other person he refers to can sometimes be himself; his demons, fears, or his passions. The early release of \"Bullet to the Heart,\" an emotional track he shared with the world a few weeks before the album dropped, showed this more raw, vulnerable side of himself. \u201cNothing is perfect, and you can\u2019t be perfect as a human being... There will always be hardships in our lives, and I just wanna make sure everyone out there knows what their dreams are and go after them,\" he says. \"At the end of the day we\u2019re all driven by love, and nothing else matters.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s definitely love that\u2019s driven Jackson to this moment. Love for his fans, for his job, and an immense passion towards music. Throughout our chat he repeatedly mentions he feels very blessed and lucky to have the opportunity to do what he loves. However, in Wang\u2019s case his success has a lot to do with hard work and dedication, and very little to do with luck. Work mode is 24/7 in Jackson's life, but for some time now, he\u2019s been trying to find a balance.\n\n\u201cI think there won't be something like a vacation for me anytime soon. Right now it\u2019s all work, but there's so many things I want to achieve, so I just wanna keep going after my dreams,\" he says. \"When you love something this much, you'll maybe feel tired physically, but mentally I\u2019m always happy. I feel so blessed and thankful that I'm able to still do what I do every single day.\u201d\n\nBut the nonstop lifestyle and global fame come with some downsides. \"I\u2019m always working instead, it\u2019s getting to my head,\" he sings on \"Unless I\u2019m With You.\"\n\n\u201cI wanna do this all my life, but sometimes I\u2019m afraid if I keep running like this I could get sick. I hope not though. I\u2019m running 24/7 and by the time it\u2019s midnight [in Asia] the other side of the world wakes up, so it\u2019s nonstop,\" Jackson admits.\n\nPart of that balance involves learning to let go. The pressure to be perfect led him to extreme diets, intense workout routines, and tons of self-imposed restrictions in order to fit into the mold he was supposed to. Now, being perfect is not one of his goals anymore and he\u2019s opened up to share his journey with his fans, who are extremely supportive.\n\n\n\nBefore we wrapped up, we asked Jackson to give himself a piece of advice, \u201cCalm down, you\u2019re doing fine. Everything is gonna work out, trust me. You have a passionate team around you, so take it easy. And please don\u2019t share your shake recipe anymore because everyone got enough of it. And remember to always thank all your fans. They\u2019re everything. They are amazing.\u201d\n\n", "description": "The GOT7 member delivers his most honest work yet with his first full-length album 'Mirrors.'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db329c535b3a6008dbb4b96/lede/1572026356422-Jackson-Wang-MV-Stills-Titanic-Single-2.png?crop=0.9368751785204228xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
