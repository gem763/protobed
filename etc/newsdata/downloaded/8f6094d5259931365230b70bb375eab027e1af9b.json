The first is that you can simply avoid it in the first place. According to Dan McTeague, a noted petroleum analyst, Shell and Esso 91 are both ethanol free. All other grades from the companies have some ethanol content, but the mid-grade blend is pure gas, which means it not only corrodes less than ethanol blends, but is less likely to deteriorate when stored. Don\u2019t be misled into thinking higher octane gas contains less ethanol. In fact, it has more! The octane rating of pure ethanol is 100, but when it\u2019s blended with gasoline, it performs as if it\u2019s 112. In other words, higher-octane blends \u2014 Petro Canada\u2019s 94 and Esso\u2019s 93 \u2014 use more ethanol, not less.\n\nFor those storing their vehicles for the winter, specialty gasoline makers \u2014 yes, there are boutique gasoline manufacturers! \u2014 offer ethanol-free formulations specifically tailored for a long shelf life (as much as two years). For those on a budget, a trip down to Canadian Tire for some fuel stabilizer is usually good enough to preserve your pump gas \u2014 use that Shell and Esso 91 stuff \u2014 over the winter.\n\nA little creativity \u2014 and common sense \u2014 can help here. For instance, when I ride my classic 1982 Honda CB1100R frequently, I\u2019ll often fill up with Petro Canada 94, which does contain ethanol, for its higher octane, the gas never in carburetor long enough to cause damage. However, whenever I know she\u2019s going to be laid up for a while \u2014 especially over the winter \u2014 I make sure the last tank I run through her is ethanol-free.\n\nThat same common sense applies to other vehicles. For instance, the point to the plug-in aspect of the modern PHEV is to actuate the gasoline portion of its drivetrain as infrequently as possible. For particularly careful owners of longer range PHEVs \u2014 Chevrolet\u2019s Volt comes to mind \u2014 that can mean refuelling as infrequently as every three months. It behoves the careful Volt owners, then, to ensure that ethanol isn\u2019t gumming-up the car\u2019s drivetrain and shop for an ethanol-free pump. Yes, most PHEVs will have corrosion-resistant pipelines, but it never hurts to err on the side of caution.\n\nMore troublesome for older, carbureted vehicles is that ethanol is 35 per cent oxygen. Burning it can cause an older carbureted engine to run \u201clean\u201d \u2014 combining too much air with too little fuel. In mild cases, said overenthusiastic blending of oxygen can cause older engines to stumble, spit and cough. In a worse case scenario, it can even lead to catastrophic \u2014 as in big, gaping holes \u2014 piston failure. For the true gear head, yes, that does mean that the very thing you\u2019re trying to prevent \u2014 the \u201cpinging\u201d caused but lower octane fuel \u2014 is exacerbated when you fill up with premium 94 because your hot-rod is now running hotter thanks to a leaner mixture.\n\nYes, it\u2019s a paradox, but forewarned is forearmed.", "description": "If you're looking to store your classic car, motorcycle, or ATV for the winter, here are a few precautions", "authors": ["Hours Ago"], "top_image": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/ealder-hadfield-tbird-03.jpg?quality=80", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
