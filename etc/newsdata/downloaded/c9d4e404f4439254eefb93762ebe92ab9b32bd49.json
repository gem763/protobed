(Wayne Morrissey)\n\nWhen a city inspector visited the unit below Morrissey's several months ago, they determined there was structural damage.\n\nIt turns out, the wall was removed without a permit from the city or the knowledge of the strata.\n\nIn an emailed statement, the city says the wall was removed without authorization from the municipality.\n\nA city inspector notified the homeowner he was still required to get a permit, even though the wall had already been removed, and would be charged double the regular permit fee as a penalty.\n\n\"A follow-up inspection found that structural concerns remain, and the city will be engaging the owner and building strata to address these,\" it said in the city's email.\n\nThe email from the city noted that if Morrissey had concerns with the unit, he should contact the strata.\n\nMorrissey fears his home is now unsafe to live in but says he has nowhere else to go. (Jesse Johnston/CBC)\n\nStrata battle\n\nThe strata didn't respond to CBC's request for a comment.\n\nMorrissey alleged, however, that once he notified the strata council about the wall, he was told the strata planned to wait for one year to see if the damage got worse.\n\nMorrissey's lawyers sent a strongly-worded letter to the strata council and the property manager who serves as its agent on May 7, 2019.\n\n\"We understand from our client that when the council and property manager were first made aware of the issue, the decision was made to wait for one year before taking any action to 'see if it gets worse,\" Morrisey's lawyers wrote.\n\nThe property manager did not respond to the CBC's request for comment.\n\nMorrissey says it's frustrating that the city and strata seem to be blaming each other.\n\n\"That's the key for me is someone take responsibility,\" he said. \"It's not that much to ask.\"\n\nIt's been more than a year since the suite below Morrissey's was altered. (Jesse Johnston/CBC)\n\nWhat's next?\n\nTony Gioventu, executive director of the Condominium Home Owners Association of B.C. says it's common for cases like this one to end up in court or the Civil Resolution Tribunal.\n\n\"They're messy,\" he told CBC. \"It's often where these cases end up.\"\n\nMorrissey recently lost his job, so moving isn't a realistic option and he doesn't want to sell because as the damage gets worse, his property value continues to decrease.\n\nHe estimates it's dropped by about $150,000 since the support wall in the unit below his was removed.\n\n\"It's like nobody really cares,\" he said. \"I'm just so worn down and exhausted by it all.\"", "description": "There\u2019s a dinner table-sized hole in the wall that separates the kitchen from the living room in Wayne Morrissey\u2019s apartment in Vancouver\u2019s West End neighbourhood.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5325235.1571347298!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/wayne-morrissey-damaged-wall.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
