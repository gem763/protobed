Everybody is coming up and shaking his hand. He\u2019s enjoying hanging out with the other inmates.\u201d\n\nCohen\u2019s serving his time at Otisville, a federal prison in New York that houses 120 inmates. In addition to making new friends, Schwartz adds that Cohen\u2019s spending his days getting buff.\n\n\u201cMichael has a job fixing fire hydrants,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cHe really enjoys his work. He looks great \u2014 he is tan, works out every day and has lost more than 30 pounds. He sleeps in a cubicle with a bed, night table and a desk \u2026 He is basically very unstressed. The only downside is he misses his family.\u201d\n\nCohen also reached out to Page Six from behind bars, taking issue with a recent story that claimed Omarosa Manigualt Newman was his \u201cnew self-help guru.\u201d \u201cOmarosa is not my spiritual advisor (I\u2019m Jewish),\u201d Cohen wrote. \u201cShe is not my emotional advisor (She is a friend). She did not come to Otisville \u2026 as she has not yet been approved for visitation.\u201d\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at Page Six", "description": "The former presidential \"fixer\" started his three-year prison sentence back in May, and according to his lawyer, he's living the good life behind bars.", "authors": ["Bonnie Stiernberg"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1134111173.jpg?fit=1046%2C800", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
