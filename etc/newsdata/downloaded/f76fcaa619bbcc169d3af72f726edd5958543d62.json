The body isn\u2019t even cold yet.\u201d\n\nMalkin, meanwhile, said her remark was \u201cpertinent\u201d to the issue of \u201cfake news,\u201d bringing up an instance in 1994 when Roberts stood in front of a projection of the Capitol to do an ABC News report from the State of the Union address.\n\n\u201cThis was a deliberate attempt to deceive the viewing public into thinking she was actually there live covering it,\u201d Malkin added. \u201cFake news has existed FAR longer than before President Trump even had the idea of running for office.\u201d\n\nMalkin\u2019s remarks, predictably, were not well received by the attendees, with many in the audience shouting at her to leave and go home.\n\nTuesday was far from the first time that Malkin has kicked dirt on a prominent figure after he or she has passed away. During this year\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference, Malkin slammed the \u201cghost of John McCain\u201d for what she described as his weak immigration policies.", "description": "\u201cWe\u2019re doing this today?\u201d CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter pushed back. \u201cYou\u2019re attacking her today.
