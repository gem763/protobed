It was a huge hit. Since then, he\u2019s challenged me to come up with even bigger and more elaborate costumes every year. Not only does he absolutely love this, but newspapers and websites began picking up his pictures and sharing them. That\u2019s what put the wheels in motion. Requests quickly started coming in from all over the country, and Walkin\u2019 & Rollin\u2019 Costumes was born. Today, this non-profit organization is dedicated to building costumes for kids in walkers and wheelchairs, free of charge to the families, made possible due to the kindness of over 100 volunteers around the nation and donations to help cover the costs.\n\nDavis said the first costume he made helped other children feel more comfortable around his son.\n\n\u201cIt was actually the icebreaker that suddenly made all the other kids realize he\u2019s just like us,\u201d he recalled.\n\nThe non-profit\u2019s website stated that it has since built costumes with themes ranging from Toy Story to Star Wars with the help of over 100 volunteers and donations that help cover the cost.\n\n\u201cJust sent one to Hawaii, and that was for a Black Hawk helicopter for a little girl,\u201d Davis said.\n\nThe Rockin\u2019 & Rollin\u2019 Costumes website invited anyone who wishes to take part in their efforts to join them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited for what the future may hold. Come along with us. And help us make a child\u2019s dream come true,\u201d the site concluded.", "description": "A Kansas boy will be the coolest kid on the block this Halloween thanks to a non-profit group that builds costumes for kids in wheelchairs.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/blue-Halloween-bucket-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
