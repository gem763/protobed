Another friend was thrown from the car and survived.\n\nThe South Florida SunSentinel reports that James B. Riley sued Wednesday in Santa Clara County, California, where Tesla is based.\n\nMonserrat's parents filed a similar lawsuit in January. Both blame the car's lithium-ion battery pack, which exploded when the Tesla hit a concrete wall.\n\nPolice say Barrett Riley and his 18-year-old friend Edgar Monserrat died when Riley lost control of his father's car at 116 mph (187 kph) in May 2018\n\nJames B. Riley and wife Jenny sued Wednesday in Santa Clara County, California, where Tesla is based, blaming the car's lithium-ion battery pack, which exploded when the Tesla hit a concrete wall\n\nThe speeding Tesla slammed into a wall and caught fire but the lawsuit says the crash should have been 'entirely survivable'\n\nA Tesla statement earlier this year said 'no car could have withstood a high-speed crash of this kind'.\n\nThe suit alleges the Tesla battery was inadequately protected, making the vehicle defective.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit 'Barrett Riley was killed by the battery fire, not by the accident'. It notes he didn't suffer head or bodily injuries other than the burns.\n\nAnother friend was thrown from the car and survived.\n\nThe father claims Tesla knowingly failed to install safety measures to prevent the 2014 Model S from engulfing in flames.\n\nFirstly he claims he and his wife had requested installment of a device to limit speed to 85mph two months before the accident, after the teen had gotten a speeding ticket.\n\nBut it was removed without his permission when the car went in for servicing.\n\nThe father's lawsuit says the car owner and his wife Jenny had asked for a device to limit speed to 85mph just two months before the accident after the teen had gotten a speeding ticket\n\n'As parents, James and Jenny took action to protect their son and trusted Tesla to ensure their vehicles were safe and to honor their request,' lawyer, Curtis B. Miner said in a statement. 'If Tesla would have informed the Riley's that they removed the device they had originally installed to protect their son, they would never have permitted their son to drive the vehicle.\n\n'If the speed limiter had remained in place as the Riley's instructed, the accident would never have happened, and Barrett Riley would be alive today.'\n\nTesla's Speed Limit Mode, allowing car owners to limit speed, 'was introduced as an over-the-air update last year in dedication to our customer's son, Barrett Riley, who tragically passed away in the accident,' the company spokesperson said in January.\n\nThe lawsuit states that Tesla had even patented a design to prevent the 'thermal runaway' that the victims were subjected to when the car burst into flames.\n\nThe partner at Colson Hicks Eidson law firm claims the design came before the 2014 Model S was manufactured, but Tesla failed to implement it in the plaintiff's Model S.\n\nThe motor's battery reignited twice after the fire was extinguished by emergency crews\n\n'The driver's side of the vehicle was largely undamaged,' Miner added. 'Barret Riley died inside the Model S solely due to the runaway battery fire, which could have been avoided had the proper safety measures been implemented. Tesla was fully aware of the risk of thermal runaway in its lithium-ion batteries.'\n\nThe motor's battery reignited twice after the fire was extinguished by emergency crews on the scene.\n\nA similar argument was made by the other teen victim's parents in a lawsuit filed January.\n\nChicago law firm Corboy & Demetrio filed a product liability and negligence suit against the automaker over the death of Edgar Monserratt Martinez in the May 2018 crash in Florida.\n\nWitnesses told investigators the driver, Riley, lost control of the vehicle while trying to pass another car. The vehicle then crossed a sidewalk and hit a wall, erupting in flames, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.\n\n'The Tesla S battery was prone to extremely intense fires incapable of being timely extinguished,' Philip Corboy Jr, a partner at the firm, said in a statement.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson said at the time: 'Our thoughts continue to be with the families affected by this tragedy. Unfortunately, no car could have withstood a high-speed crash of this kind.'", "description": "Barrett Riley's father James filed a lawsuit in California Wednesday, claiming Tesla's battery was inadequately protected in the May 2018 Florida crash, making the 2014 Model S defective.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/18/19550338-0-image-a-77_1570729385563.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
