It also said it would introduce a two-tier system for negative rate policy.\n\nBond yields across the euro area have dropped into negative territory this year amid expectations for more stimulus from the ECB in the face of growing geopolitical risks from Brexit to the U.S.-China trade war. The euro, meanwhile, touched its lowest level in over two years earlier this month.\n\nThe shared currency fell 0.2% to $1.10 as of 12:49 p.m. in London. German 10-year bond yields dropped four basis points to -0.61%, while those on Italian sovereigns slid 13 basis points to 0.85%.", "description": "Euro Falls, Bonds Rally After ECB Announces Fresh Bond Buying", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/redesign/images/seo/investing_300X300.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
