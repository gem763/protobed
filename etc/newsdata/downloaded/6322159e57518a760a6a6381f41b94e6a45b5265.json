The official line has been disputed since the news first broke, sparking a wide variety of conspiracy theories given Epstein\u2019s high profile political connections, which reportedly include the Clintons, the current US president Donald Trump, and British royalty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 80 days now and the brother feels he is getting a runaround,\u201d Baden told Fox. \u201cHe thinks that his brother wasn\u2019t the type to commit suicide but he wants to get the information that he hasn\u2019t been able to get so far.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Is this a joke?\u2019 Times claim that MI6 fears Russia has \u2018kompromat\u2019 on Prince Andrew over Epstein draws laughs\n\nThe city\u2019s chief medical examiner, Dr Barbara Sampson, who ruled Epstein\u2019s death a suicide on August 10 vehemently disputes Baden\u2019s determination.\n\nSome online commentators also took issue with Baden being cited as a credible source given his own chequered past when employed by medical examiners\u2019 offices.\n\nHe was allegedly dismissed by the New York City office in 1979 for poor record-keeping and overall performance.\n\nLike this story?
