He said they were led into a gas chamber and the door was locked behind them. Then, he said he heard \u201cscreams and screams\u201d.\n\nAfterwards, it went quiet. But Dey insists that he did not know that the prisoners had been gassed.\n\nEarlier in the trial in Hamburg, Dey had told the court that he was unaware that thousands of prisoners were murdered at Stutthof concentration camp, but nonetheless described the site as a \u201cplace of horror\u201d.\n\nThe 93-year-old said that he did not voluntarily become an SS security guard, but was transferred from the army at age 17 due to a heart defect.\n\nAt Stutthof camp, in what is now Gdansk, Poland, Dey helped to oversee the killing of 5,230 people out of 66,000 who were murdered.\n\n(Image: POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHe was just a small part of the Holocaust, which claimed six million lives. When the war ended he slipped away, like so many other fellow travellers, to build a new life in the new West Germany.\n\nBut justice has finally caught up with the father of two. He is now on trial in Hamburg for the part he played during the Second World War.\n\nDuring interrogations he confessed to \u201chearing these screams from afar in the gas chamber, and before that they screamed for their lives and fought for their lives\u201d.\n\nNow, he is finally in the dock. He will likely enter the history books as the last person to answer for crimes of genocide committed during the Second World War.\n\n(Image: Internet unknown)\n\nDey has previously admitted to seeing \u201chundreds\u201d of bodies and said that he knew about the mass gassings. He said that he saw babies killed by being swung by the legs as their heads were smashed into concrete walls.\n\nThere are no living witnesses to verify his crimes, or to state exactly what he did or did not do within the perimeter of Stutthof.\n\nHe is being tried according to the principle of common purpose, on the grounds that he was working at the camp and therefore part of the Nazi conspiracy.\n\nWhile denying any specific acts of cruelty or murder, he said in an interview with prosecutors on July 6, 2018: \u201cI knew well that these murdered people were Jews who did not commit crimes. That they were only there because they were Jews.\n\n\u201cAnd they have as much a right to live and work freely as any other human being.\u201d\n\nSS records from Dey\u2019s Death\u2019s Head unit prove that he was on duty between August 9, 1944 and April 26, 1945, when the 5,230 prisoners were gassed, shot, hanged or otherwise killed.\n\nHe is being tried in the juvenile court in Hamburg because he was a teenager when he served in the camp. He faces up to 10 years in jail if found guilty.\n\nHis defence lawyer, Stefan Waterkamp, said: \u201cHe was not a supporter of the system.\n\n\u201cBut because he lived near the concentration camp, he got his marching orders to Stutthof. My client now calls his whole life into question.\n\nHe feels sorry for what he did and said as much during his interrogation.\u201c\n\nAccording to the prosecutor\u2019s office, one of the tasks of the \u201cSS shooter\u201d was to prevent the \u201cescape, revolt and liberation of prisoners\u201d.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe prosecution calls Dey, who lives in Hamburg with his wife \u201ca coercer of the murder machine\u201d.\n\nDey was born in 1926 in what is now Gdansk in Poland. He went on to join Hitler Youth, and spent six months in the army, but it is unknown if he saw action.\n\nAfter the war, he was taken as a prisoner of war and released in December 1945. In 1955, he married and moved to Hamburg.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThere has been renewed interest in Germany in bringing concentration camp guards to justice since the 2012 prosecution of Ivan Demjanjuk, a former Ukrainian SS guard at Sobibor camp in Poland.\n\nFor the first time since the war ended, prosecutors said it was not necessary to have eyewitnesses, records of specific crimes or testimony of survivors.\n\nDemjanjuk was tried simply because he was at the camp, and Dey faces the same rules.\n\nIn Germany, co-plaintiffs \u2013 relatives of the dead \u2013 can appear on the docket as accusers, and 12 will testify at Dey\u2019s trial.\n\nOne is Judith Meisel, 94, from Minneapolis, US, who was in Stutthof at age 14 and lost her mother there.\n\n(Image: Grab)\n\nHer lawyer, Prof Dr Cornelius Nestler, 63, said: \u201cStutthof was organised mass murder and this mass murder was only possible with the help of the guards. The defendant helped to murder her mother\u201d\n\nFania Brancovskaja, 97, from Lithuania, is another co-plaintiff. She lost all but one of her cousins in the Holocaust.\n\nHer sister Riva was murdered in Stutthof. Her lawyer, Onur Ozata, said: \u201cThe trial is very important for my client.\n\nShe hopes that this will not let her family murdered by the Nazis, and all the victims of the [Holocaust], be forgotten.\n\n\u201cShe also hopes [it] can send a signal against rising anti-Semitism in Europe.\u201d\n\nChief Prosecutor Lars Mahnke called Dey \u201ca small cog in the killing machine. But it is right that the word knows what he did and what went on at Stutthof\u201d.", "description": "SS guard Bruno Dey, now 93, is standing trial in Hamburg after justice finally caught up with him", "authors": ["Allan Hall", "In Berlin", "Image", "Pool Afp Via Getty Images", "Internet Unknown", "Pa", "Afp Getty Images", "Grab"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20725357.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GERMANY-TRIAL-HISTORY-WWII-NAZI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
