My season had ended a little bit earlier than I had expected it,\u201d the 15-time major winner told reporters at Accordia Golf, Narashino Country Club near Tokyo before coming through an exhibition match unscathed.\n\n\u201cI had the procedure a little bit early and got ahead of it,\u201d he added.\n\nWoods is in Japan this week to play in the US PGA Tour\u2019s inaugural Zozo Championship, the second $9.75 million tournament of an almost $30 million three-event Asian swing.\n\nHe intends to end his year by playing in the Hero World Challenge beginning December 4, before going to Australia to captain Team USA in the Presidents Cup a week later.\n\nWoods, who completed a remarkable return from years of injury and personal problems to win the US Masters in April, said his knee had been giving him more pain as the year wore on.\n\n\u201cIt progressively got worse and got to the point where it was affecting even reading putts,\u201d the 43-year-old Woods said.\n\nWoods has a large depth of talent from which to make his four captains picks ahead of the match against Ernie Els\u2019s International team at Royal Melbourne.\n\n\u2013 Needling and jabbing \u2013\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been pretty consumed by it,\u201d he said, adding his return to fitness made it more likely that he would use one of his wildcards on himself.\n\n\u201cIt made me more hopeful that I could play this week, play Hero and play Australia,\u201d said Woods, who has dropped one place to number 10 in Monday\u2019s new world rankings.\n\n\u201cThe way I was feeling towards the middle part of the year, it was going to be a tall order to be able to do it all.\u201d\n\nIf Woods burns one of his picks on himself that leaves him the difficulty of choosing three players from the likes US Open champion, Gary Woodland, Tony Finau, Rickie Fowler, Kevin Kisner and Jordan Spieth.\n\nWoods also reiterated he wanted to come back to Japan next year to represent the US at the 2020 Olympics.\n\n\u201cI would love to play in an Olympic Games,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be an honour to represent my country in an Olympic Games. Hopefully next year I can have a good year and qualify.\u201d\n\nBefore all that, however, Woods on Monday shook off the rust and tested his knee in a made-for-TV exhibition \u2014 \u201cThe Challenge: Japan Skins\u201d \u2014 against Rory McIlroy, Jason Day and Hideki Matsuyama.\n\nIt was knockabout stuff with plenty of banter to entertain large galleries of Japan\u2019s golf-mad fans as the players tried to win holes outright for cash or \u201cskins\u201d worth anything from $10,000 to $100,000.\n\nWoods looked healthy throughout the 18 holes, though the golf was nowhere near as intense as tournament play.\n\nDay came out on top, pocketing $210,000 mainly because of winning the final two skins. Woods and McIlroy scooped $60,000 each and Matsuyama $20,000.\n\n\u201cJust being able to compete again, I haven\u2019t done this in a little bit now,\u201d said Woods.\n\n\u201cI just thought the competitive atmosphere was fantastic, the shots we hit were great.\n\n\u201cAnd on top of that, I think the banter back and forth, the needling, the jabbing, it was all good fun and I hope we were entertaining everyone.\u201d", "description": "Narashino (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Tiger Woods said Monday his fitness was ahead of schedule after arthroscopic knee surgery, and dropped a heavy clue he", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/defd66_happy-healthy-tiger-woods-attends-press-conference-pga-tour-zozo-championships-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
