'So by day it's a graphic and by night it's a lantern.'\n\nWhen the sunlight peeks through the triangular form it gives an intriguing glow and almost feels as though you're in a lightbox.\n\nThe owner of the Albert Park estate only ever wanted to renovate and flip the house but after seeing what was possible he decided to move in for a year and get a feel for it himself, which was the ultimate compliment to Lim.\n\nThe owner of the Albert Park estate only ever wanted to renovate and flip the house but after seeing what was possible he decided to move in for a year and get a feel for it himself, which was the ultimate compliment to Lim (living room pictured)\n\nThe rooms have plenty of triangular shapes scattered throughout them, including this corner\n\nBut now, a year later, The Agency's Brendan Coburn is quoting between $2million and $2.2million for the house to be auctioned on November 16 (the bathroom pictured)\n\n'A client with faith in us allowed us to explore the different options and to do what we thought was best for the site,' he said.\n\nBut now, a year later, The Agency's Brendan Coburn is quoting between $2million and $2.2million for the house to be auctioned on November 16.\n\nWhile the price may seem steep there are plenty of properties in the area of equal size which are $2.5million plus.", "description": "A three-bedroom 'downside up' home in Melbourne might look as though it couldn't possibly fit more than one person on the tiny plot of land, but it actually opens up into a haven.", "authors": ["Matilda Rudd For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/23/20303082-0-image-a-4_1572305347414.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
