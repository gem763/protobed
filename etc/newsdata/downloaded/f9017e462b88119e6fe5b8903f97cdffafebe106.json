Naturally, there was a protest which featured chanting and a die-in. But there were also people eager to try the food. When the new store opened at 10:30 am the first people inside had been camped out front all night:\n\nGood morning from the first Chick-Fil-A location in Canada, opening at 10:30am.

Matt Walsh suggested maybe it was time to let it go:\n\nSeven years ago the CEO of Chick-fil-A said he believes in biblical marriage. Gay rights activists still haven't gotten over it. If there was an Olympic event for holding petty grudges, these people would win the gold every year. It's remarkable. \u2014 Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) September 6, 2019\n\nIn addition to LGBT folks, there was also a contingent of protesters concerned about chickens (2nd clip below):\n\nProtester addresses the crowd on a megaphone outside the #ChickfikA store. pic.twitter.com/AEao19ggyE \u2014 Mark Carcasole (@MarkCarcGlobal) September 6, 2019\n\nAnd also about capitalism:\n\nChick-fil-A protest leader: \u201cCapitalism has shrouded our sacred hearts\u201d\n\noh, of course they are also commies pic.twitter.com/tdIoq9WkTx \u2014 Harry Khachatrian (@Harry1T6) September 6, 2019\n\nA little while later they held a die-in on the sidewalk. Notice the line of people stepping over the bodies to get to the delicious food:\n\nAnimal rights protesters now lying on the sidewalk to block Chick-Fil-A entrance.

In the video clip below it looks to me like at least 100 people are waiting for food. And of course the customers aren\u2019t hanging out to make a point like the protesters, they\u2019re cycling through the restaurant and the line stays long because new customers are constantly getting in line.\n\nThere was a \u201cbig protest\u201d organized at the first Chick-Fil-A that just opened in Toronto today. The line-up to get inside for lunch has more people than the entire protest crowd pic.twitter.com/jsg7mt2lSD \u2014 Harry Khachatrian (@Harry1T6) September 6, 2019\n\nDespite the protest, the lunchtime lineup outside #TO #ChickfilA remains as long as it was this morning. pic.twitter.com/LptTBK2xKS \u2014 Mark Carcasole (@MarkCarcGlobal) September 6, 2019\n\nThe Rebel put together a pretty good video covering the protest this morning. There are people of all backgrounds and colors waiting in line. None of them are there to do harm to gay people, though they are admittedly there to do harm to chickens. The interviewer meets one engaged gay couple in line. Asked if the protesters represents them, one of the guys (his name isn\u2019t given) replies, \u201cThey don\u2019t represent me, they represent foolishness in my mind.\u201d Very well said.", "description": "Far more customers than protesters.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Toronto-protest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
