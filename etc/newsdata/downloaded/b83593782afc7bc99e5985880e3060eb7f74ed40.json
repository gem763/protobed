So that was quite traumatic.'\n\nCarl Beech, also known as 'Nick', made a series of false claims\n\nHe admitted: 'Even back then when I was more intense, I understood I couldn't get too close to the people making the allegations.\n\n'I hate to see people in pain and I genuinely feel very deeply for the people that have had injustices done to them as a result of the failed police inquiries. I really do.\n\n'And I understand why they're angry and I understand why some of their anger is targeted at me.'\n\nMr Watson claimed he did not want anyone to 'feel sorry' for him because of the backlash.\n\nHe added: 'I did my best, and that's all you can do in life.\n\n'So I'm genuinely very, very sorry and I just say I genuinely was trying to do the right thing.' But last night Mr Watson's apology was rejected by a relative of one of those falsely accused of abuse.\n\nDaniel Janner QC, son of Labour peer Lord Greville Janner, said: 'Tom Watson's synthetic attempt to portray himself as the victim when he trashed good men's reputations for his blatant political advantage will cut no ice. If he had genuine decency he would resign for the suffering he has caused.'\n\nFormer Tory MP Harvey Proctor, who was falsely accused of being a serial child killer by Beech, said: 'Watson's words are enormously hurtful. I can see through him. I hope others will.\n\n'He is utterly insensitive to the damage he has caused. Even now he just thinks about himself.'", "description": "Tom Watson had piled pressure on detectives investigating the false claims made by Carl Beech before they launched the disastrous Operation Midland inquiry in November 2014.", "authors": ["Daniel Martin And Stephen Wright For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/01/19612920-0-image-a-162_1570839531840.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
