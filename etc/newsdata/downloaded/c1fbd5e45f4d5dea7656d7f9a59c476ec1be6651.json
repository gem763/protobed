The matter ran for four years and involved several expensive barristers.\n\nBannister Law also brought a similar class action that was dealt with alongside Maurice Blackburn's but, unlike the latter's, it was powered by a litigation funder and could thus lessen the overal settlements received by claimants.\n\nThe funder could apply to the court for a common fund order, which would see its costs come out of the entire settlement amount, not just the amounts received by those it entered funding agreements with. It would not impact those who had signed on with Maurice Blackburn.\n\nBannister Law principal, Charles Bannister, believed the funder intended to ask for a common fund order of 10 per cent or less of the total settlement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Schimmel said that the settlement was \"a significant win for motorists, especially considering the uncertainty and additional costs and time involved with another trial and potential appeals that could drag on for years\".\n\nACCC case still afoot\n\nThe Federal Court starts hearing the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's case against Volkswagen, Audi and Skoda over the emissions scandal next week. The hearing will wrap up just before Christmas, unless the regulator and car manufacturers reach a settlement before then.\n\n\"Discussions regarding an in-principle settlement of the civil suit by the ACCC ... are close to finalisation and a resolution between the parties is expected shortly. The details are confidential at this time,\" a Volkswagen spokesperson said on Monday.\n\nLooking at the consequences of the emissions scandal abroad, Volkswagen agreed to pay a \u20ac1 billion ($1.61 billion) fine in Germany. One of their executives, Oliver Schmidt, was fined $US400,000 ($582,000) for participating in what US prosecutors called \"one of the largest corporate fraud schemes in American history\u201d.\n\nAudi\u2019s then-chairman Rupert Stadler was arrested in Germany in June last year for his role in the alleged emissions cheating practices. He has since stepped down from his roles at Audi.\n\nMr Schimmel said the tougher penalties suffered by the car companies abroad did not mean that Australia's consumer protections were not strong enough. \"In the context of our legal system, this is a really significant result and victory,\" he said.", "description": "Volkswagen, Audi and Skoda have settled a class action that means Australian drivers could receive up to $1400 each.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2122%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/80ac53327a451ee190b8508509197c6238283fb6", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
