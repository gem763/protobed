He suggested the Second Amendment does not allow citizens to \u201cshoulder a bazooka,\u201d nor does it protect ownership of AR-15s and AK-47s.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen the Second Amendment was adopted and ratified, it took three minutes to reload your musket. I don\u2019t know that the Founding Fathers, the framers of the Constitution, those that pursued that Second Amendment \u2026 could have envisioned a weapon designed for war [being available to private citizens].\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke overlooked a couple of important points.\n\nFirst, the military rifle he referenced is not a semiautomatic AR-15, which millions upon millions of Americans own and love, but a fully automatic M16 and/or M4. An AR-15 shoots one bullet per trigger pull, period, while an M-16 and/or M4 can shoot an entire magazine full of ammunition with a single pull of the trigger. (Some versions of the M4 only allow three-round bursts of full auto, but that is still a military option not available in civilian AR-15s.)\n\nThe second fact O\u2019Rourke overlooks is muskets in private possession when the Second Amendment was ratified were military weapons. It was with such muskets that Patriots throughout southern colonies repelled and ultimately defeated the invading British Red Coats.\n\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation calculates there are more than 16 million privately owned AR-15s in the United States.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
