According to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the answer is pretty bloody well off. Three Aussie cities managed to place in the top ten, with a perfect score for healthcare, infrastructure and education. Here are the results.\n\nThis year, the EIU's Global Liveability Index ranked 140 major cities from around the globe to determine the best places to live. Each city was judged across the following five categories:\n\nStability , including the prevalence of petty and violent crime, the threat of terror, and the threat of military conflict\n\n, including the prevalence of petty and violent crime, the threat of terror, and the threat of military conflict Healthcare , including the availability and quality of healthcare, both public and private\n\n, including the availability and quality of healthcare, both public and private Culture and environment , including climate, level of corruption, level of censorship, and sporting availability\n\n, including climate, level of corruption, level of censorship, and sporting availability Education , including the availability and quality of private education\n\n, including the availability and quality of private education Infrastructure, including the quality of road networks and public transport, the availability of good quality housing, the quality of telecommunications, and the quality of water and energy provisions\n\nWhile many of us love to complain about our country's numerous foibles - especially public transport and internet speeds - it seems we're not doing to badly overall. No fewer than three Australian cities made the top ten, with Sydney and Melbourne ranked #3 and $2, respectively.
