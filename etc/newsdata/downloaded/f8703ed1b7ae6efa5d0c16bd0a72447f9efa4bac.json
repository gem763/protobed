Instagram/Dani_Kholik via Reuters, Starwars.com\n\nThe skies in Indonesia\u2019s Muaro Jambi regency turned blood-red on Sunday (Sept 22).\n\nVideos of the phenomenon, taken by shocked townspeople, went viral on social media.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s meterological agency said the red sky was due to pollutants in the air created by peatland fires.\n\nThese fires \u2013 and hazardous levels of resulting haze \u2013 have blanketed Indonesia for the past fortnight.\n\nIt\u2019s not on Mars, not a filter, and not badly photoshopped.\n\nInstead, videos of an Indonesian province have gone viral on social media for showing roads and towns bathed in an otherwordly, blood-red glow.\n\nShocked residents of Sumatra\u2019s Muaro Jambi documented the glowing red skies outside their homes on Sunday (Sept 22), with many tying the alarming sight to raging forest fires across the island.\n\nIni sore bukan malam. Ini bumi bukan planet mars. Ini jambi bukan di luar angkasa. Ini kami yang bernafas dengan paru-paru, bukannya dengan insang. Kami ini manusia butuh udara yang bersih, bukan penuh asap.\n\nLokasi : Kumpeh, Muaro Jambi #KabutAsap #KebakaranHutanMakinMenggila pic.twitter.com/ZwGMVhItwi \u2014 Zuni Shofi Yatun Nisa (@zunishofiyn) September 21, 2019\n\nJambi, a south-eastern province on the island of Sumatra, is one of two areas where forest burning and toxic haze is currently at its worst, the other being Kalimantan.\n\nDapet kiriman video sama temen di bagian kumpeh,muaro jambi. Suasana nya jadi merah karna asap dan titik api disana, di kota jambi hanya asap yang tebal.\n\nPak @jokowi tolong lirik kami di jambi ini :(( pic.twitter.com/pY6IZaiElB \u2014 nirma saputri (@nirmasptri) September 21, 2019\n\nbreathed fresh air, and as you can see it just worsened. we can't do anything except pray, and giving our support to fire fighters, and one pray from you all means so much for us. thank you. \u2014 fira\ud83e\udd96\ud83d\udc30 (@yoojeongie_) September 21, 2019\n\nNetizens\u2019 videos, which show townspeople going about their business amid the dim reddish light, look almost like a scene from the swamp planet Dathomir in Star Wars (or any other evil-evoking sci-fi planet with red skies, for that matter.)\n\nCommenters described the scenes as \u201cscary\u201d, \u201ccreepy\u201d, and \u201capocalyptic\u201d, and even drew parallels with the planet Mars.\n\nThe unbelievable red hue even led some to claim the videos were a hoax.\n\nJambi\u2019s terrifying scenes come after hazardous smog from burning forests killed at least two people and made thousands of others fall ill, even affecting local wildlife like birds, snakes and the endangered Bornean orang utan.\n\nThe same day the red skies appeared, Indonesia\u2019s meteorological agency took to Instagram to clarify that the phenomenon was due to particulate matter present in haze, and not the fires themselves.\n\nAccording to satellite images, forest fires are burning near Jambi\u2019s Berbak National Park, an enormous peatland. Burning dried peat, which is rich in carbon, creates extra toxic haze thick with fine particulate matter.\n\nIncredible images from Sentinel 2 of the forest fires burning in Jambi region in Indonesia. Hundreds of fire burning around Berbak National Park putting a lot of pressure on this ecosystem, the largest undisturbed swamp forest in southeastern Asia. https://t.co/E3u2Y8nVXt pic.twitter.com/p0QaBFrjad \u2014 Juan Caama\u00f1o (@jcaamano_) September 22, 2019\n\nThick smoke blown in from these hot spots blanketed the Jambi province, resulting in \u201chazardous\u201d concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM10), such as fine ash, in the Muaro Jambi area on Sept 22.\n\nWhile nearby areas like Palembang and Pekanbaru also saw high PM10 readings, these particles were \u201cvery highly concentrated\u201d over a broad area in the regency specifically, the agency said.\n\nIn a phenomenon known as Mie scattering, the PM10 particles had the same diameter as the wavelength of red light \u2013 0.7 micrometers \u2013 and ended up filtering out sunlight, causing the sky to look red, it added.\n\nAccording to Sina Harian, this phenomenon had occurred in Indonesia before, after the massive eruptions of Krakatau and Mount Pinatubo in 1883 and 1991 respectively.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - It's not on Mars, not a filter, and not badly photoshopped..
