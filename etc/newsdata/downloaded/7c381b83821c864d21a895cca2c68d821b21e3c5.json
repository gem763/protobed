Remember the picture of me naked on the Houses of Parliament? I didn't see a penny for that. I was young.\n\nShock: Gail Porter, 48, has revealed she never received any money for her infamous FHM shoot which was projected onto the Houses of Parliament in 1999 (pictured in September 2018)\n\n'I went in, I did the shoot, I didn't sign anything. And that was that. The biggest-selling FHM in the UK ever, my naked a**e on a building, and I didn't get a penny.'\n\nGail feels her main mistake was being too trusting of the people she was working with at the height of her fame and assumed that everybody would act in a professional and honourable way with her.\n\nShe said: 'I trust everybody and think everyone will look after me and that's not the case in life.'\n\nThe former Celebrity Big Brother star added that she enjoyed every single minute of the attention surrounding her FHM shoot but added going bankrupt in 2017 was not the 'nicest' thing.\n\nInfamous: Gail's FHM shoot was projected onto the Houses of Parliament as a promotion for the magazine (pictured in 1999)\n\nGail explained that she had bailiffs show up to her door who she gave her \u00a3200 TV to after failing to pay several bills. The TV star also offered them her bicycle but they did not want it.\n\nGail, who has alopecia, told how she now earns enough money to get by and does not want to ever find herself in a similar position again.\n\nThe presenter said she has a few jobs on the go, including online and voice-over work and is careful with her finances.\n\nGail previously opened up about her decision to undergo a breast reduction on Loose Women.\n\nThe TV host explained her motivation behind the operation, saying she was always self-conscious about her womanly figure from a young age.\n\nShe said: 'I did the shoot, I didn't sign anything. And that was that. The biggest-selling FHM in the UK ever, my naked a**e on a building, and I didn't get a penny' (pictured in February 2019)\n\nAdmitting that her 90s modelling shots were airbrushed to make her look more petite on her top half, Gail said: 'I was very self-conscious. I'm quite a nervous person anyway.\n\n'I covered it very well but I always looked much bigger than I was because I had quite wee legs and this huge chest - the pictures I did in the 90s, obviously they were airbrushed.\n\n'There\u2019s like pictures of me with no nipples on the Houses of Parliament because apparently nipples are offensive, not my huge massive naked butt, but they were air brushed, they were moved up.'\n\nFinances: Gail also spoke about her experience of going bankrupt in 2017 and recalled having bailiffs show up at her door (pictured in August 2018)\n\nGail was previously married to Dan Hipgrave from 2001-2005 and told on another Loose Women appearance she is now looking for love.\n\nThe broadcaster told how she doesn't want to try internet dating and also wants to find a man who loves her bald.\n\n'It\u2019s not easy to meet someone the older you get and I\u2019m not far off 50 now. They\u2019re all married. Where do I look? I can\u2019t go internet dating.\n\n'He has to love me bald, not just with hair, because that\u2019s the real Gail. I\u2019m a complete romantic \u2013 I have this really Disneyland view of finding a great man.'", "description": "The TV presenter, 48, was one of the most popular TV stars in the 1990s and posed for a number of lads' mags as a result, including her famous FHM shoot in 1999.", "authors": ["Sean O'Grady For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/17/19404648-0-image-a-5_1570465019165.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
