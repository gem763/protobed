Boards in effect set their own reviews and are measured against their own criteria. While some boards take the reviews seriously, many do not.\n\n\u201cThey are self-assessments and there is perhaps a tendency to be over-complimentary of each other, so a good chairman and board has to see through that,\u201d Westpac chairman Lindsay Maxsted says.\n\n\u201cAs long as you understand they are limited, there is a role,\u201d he says. \u201cA good board-effectiveness review helped by an external consultant can bring to the surface issues the chairman or the board can\u2019t see.\u201d\n\nChristine Bartlett, a director of property group Mirvac and pharmacy business Sigma Healthcare, says she has seen good and bad reviews.\n\n\"I\u2019ve done board reviews in many shapes and forms, but more recently I did what I would call a really effective board review, which included a 360-degree survey, then one-on-one individual meetings with every board director,\" Bartlett says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"That was very cathartic in terms of making you take a really hard look at your own behaviours and also the other board members.\"\n\nThat review revealed that \"while we thought we were reasonably challenging of management, there\u2019s quite a strong appetite from management to have us challenge more\".\n\nThe 'good-job' syndrome\n\nAlmost every board thinks it is doing a good job. Even bank directors discussing the Hayne royal commission will say privately that \u201cone or two things got blown out of proportion, but overall the board did a pretty good job\u201d.\n\nBoard consultant Steve Pell says chairmen are \"looking for a better way\". Jesse Marlow\n\nBecause there is no standardisation, the review becomes an exercise in getting everyone to confirm \u201cwe\u2019re doing a good job\u201d. It\u2019s like asking people to rate their own driving: everyone scores around a seven.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing a number of chairs who\u2019ve had enough of the standard approach to board evaluations and are looking for a better way,\u201d says board consultant Steve Pell. \u201cThere will never be a checklist that stops boards who want to behave badly.\n\n\u201cThe only solution is giving boards the tools to truly take ownership of their own performance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiased consultants\n\nMost boards use an external consultant every few years, but there is huge variability in quality and sometimes strong incentives to deliver a report that reinforces the chairman\u2019s perspective.\n\nSome consultants do the work to secure the next director appointment. Others do it for the next piece of strategy consulting or as a year-on-year work stream.\n\nWhen consultants are incentivised by further work, many chairmen say they feel as if they don\u2019t receive honest feedback. Others feel like consultants need to justify their fee with a 100-page report, regardless of the issues.\n\nDistrust of the process\n\nMost directors privately admit they dislike or even distrust the evaluation process. For many, the best board evaluation ends with a report that gets parked in the bottom drawer, never to be seen again.\n\nEven if directors go out on a limb and give hard feedback, there\u2019s no assurance it will be heard or actioned. As a result, many evaluations are simply a box-ticking exercise.\n\nOne former senior executive and first-time director remembers being confronted by the chairman after submitting an honest board evaluation. \u201cDid you forget to take your meds? I think you need to go back in and have a look at the way you answered those questions,\u201d the new director was told.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDirectors say such reviews are rarely able to measure how well the board works together. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t talk about, and what you can never evaluate, is whether everyone is collaborative,\u201d says David Craig, a director at property company Lendlease. \u201cTick, yes, everyone is collaborative. But that may or may not be the case.\u201d\n\nZlatko Todorcevski, a director of cement maker Adelaide Brighton, casino operator Star Entertainment and supermarket chain Coles, agrees. \"You look at a skills matrix and it gives you a sense of industry coverage and functional skills,\" he says. \"That\u2019s great, but the way the individual works in the boardroom is as important, and we don\u2019t ever get insight into that.\n\n\"Somebody\u2019s ability to deal with stress and remain calm, maybe when management is not calm. Those personal characteristics are as important.\"", "description": "Too many board evaluations are not worth the paper they're written on, according to those who undergo them.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.239%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_2462%2C$y_671/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/21f4cc63a2235b31600c27b96f956cbefa223af8", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
