His squad was called for nine penalties worth 90 yards in the game.\n\n\"I already made the decision I'm not going to get into officiating,\" Kiffin told reporters following the loss. \"I don't know if we lose money in this conference\u2014we probably do\u2014and I don't have a lot anymore. I'm not going to lose any. I'm about to say what I want to say, but I'm not going to.\"\n\nAnd then, Kiffin said exactly what he wanted to say. He apparently thought using a meme on Twitter was a way to work around getting fined, as he joked with a commenter:\n\nConference USA commissioner Judy MacLeod released a statement in which she said the organization has \"an obligation to enforce our rules, including the prohibition of public criticism of officiating.\"\n\nMacLeod clearly considers Twitter to be just as public as a postgame press conference, and now Kiffin knows another boundary he shouldn't cross.", "description": "Florida Atlantic University head coach  Lane Kiffin 's bank account is $5,000 lighter.
