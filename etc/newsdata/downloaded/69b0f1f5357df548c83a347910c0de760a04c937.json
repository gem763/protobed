REUTERS/Monica Almeida\n\nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The U.S. television audience for the Emmy Awards show, celebrating the best of television, slumped to 6.9 million viewers, its lowest ever level, but the show was a hit on social media.\n\nAccording to Nielsen ratings data on Monday, the TV audience dropped by more than 32% from last year\u2019s ceremony, which at the time was a record low of 10.2 million U.S. viewers.\n\nThe Emmy awards, broadcast live on Fox on Sunday, awarded its highest honors to medieval fantasy drama and fan favorite \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and quirky British comedy \u201cFleabag.\u201d\n\nThe three-hour ceremony in Los Angeles was broadcast without a host against stiff competition from \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d on NBC which drew the largest audience on Sunday with 16.3 million viewers.\n\nMajor award shows have been losing ground with the public in recent years, although the Oscars in February, which featured performances by rock band Queen and Lady Gaga, bucked the trend by rising some 10 percent to some 29.6 million U.S. viewers.\n\nYet Nielsen and Fox data showed that despite the slump in TV viewers, the awards show was the most social program across broadcast and cable television. Interactions on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram were up 11% over 2018, the data showed.\n\nOn Twitter, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d was the most tweeted about show, followed by social justice drama \u201cWhen They See Us,\u201d nuclear accident series \u201cChernobyl,\u201d \u201cFleabag\u201d and thriller \u201cKilling Eve.\u201d\n\nNielsen television ratings only count those watching at home, not in public bars, restaurants or other venues.", "description": "The U.S. television audience for the Emmy Awards show, celebrating the best of television, slumped to 6.9 million viewers, its lowest ever level, but the show was a hit on social media.", "authors": ["Jill Serjeant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433208707&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0A6", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
