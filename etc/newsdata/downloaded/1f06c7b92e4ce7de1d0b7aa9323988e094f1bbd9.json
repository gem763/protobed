Trump denounced the person as \"close to a spy\" and a Democrat operating with second-hand information.\n\n\n\nIn a tweet early Saturday, Trump said that \"the so-called Whistleblower's account of my perfect phone call is 'way off,' not even close... This is a fraud against the American people!\"\n\nBut if a second whistleblower emerges, and if that person in fact has more direct information about the events in question, as the New York Times reported late Friday, the allegations would become more difficult to shrug off.\n\nThe Times said the second official was among those interviewed by inspector general Michael Atkinson about the allegations lodged by the original whistleblower.\n\nThe newspaper, citing two people briefed on the matter, said the second official was still pondering whether to lodge a formal complaint.\n\nCongressional investigators, led by House Intelligence Committee chairperson Adam Schiff, have promised a quick and expeditious inquiry, but said on Friday that the White House was not cooperating.\n\n\"The White House has refused to engage with - or even respond to - multiple requests for documents,\" said a letter signed by the Democratic chair of the House oversight, intelligence and foreign affairs committees.\n\n\"His actions have left us with no choice but to issue this subpoena.\"\n\nIn their letter to acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, the committees demanded that he turn over the requested files by October 18.\n\nThe subpoena followed a demand earlier on Friday for documents from Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nPompeo - who recently acknowledged having listened in on the key Trump-Zelensky phone call - failed to meet a Friday subpoena deadline to turn over Ukraine-related documents, CNN reported, citing a House Foreign Affairs committee aide.\n\nMeanwhile, a series of text messages between US diplomats dealing with Ukraine, made public by the congressional investigators, supported Democratic accusations that Trump had illegally sought foreign help for his reelection effort.\n\n'Most corrupt president we've had in modern history'\n\nTrump pushed back hard, saying there was no quid pro quo and, in an effort to recast the entire saga, insisted it was his responsibility to investigate \"corruption.\"\n\n\"I don't care about Biden's campaign, but I care about corruption,\" he told reporters.\n\nBiden, the former US vice president, responded by calling Trump \"the most corrupt president we've had in modern history.\"\n\n\"I am not going to stand for it,\" Biden said at a campaign event in Los Angeles.\n\n\"He has indicted himself by his own statements,\" Biden added, one day after Trump openly called for both Beijing and Kiev to investigate the Democrat for corruption.\n\nTrump has alleged that Biden's son Hunter earned \"millions\" from sitting on the board of directors of a Ukraine tycoon's gas company.\n\nBut no evidence has surfaced showing wrongdoing by either Biden.\n\nThe diplomats' text messages showed that some had doubts about Trump's pressure on Zelensky, including allegedly freezing a $400m military aid package.\n\nThe release last week of the complaint and a summary of Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, in which he asked for a \"favour\" and referred to investigating Biden, ignited the Democrats' impeachment inquiry.\n\n\n\nAs Democrats raised their attacks on Trump, many Republicans remained quietly supportive of the president.\n\nBreaking with the pack, Senator Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, blasted Trump's comments that Beijing and Kiev should investigate Biden, calling the remarks \"wrong and appalling.\"", "description": "The Trump administration has complained of harassment by Democratic lawmakers who issued subpoenas for White House documents regarding President Donald Trump's alleged pressuring of Ukraine for political favors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7851/f9e4bad8dbe8474082bd982f91ba0170.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
