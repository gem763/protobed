His administration has molded textbooks, television shows, movies and museums to match his narrative of national unity and rejuvenation under iron party rule.\n\nUnder him, the Communist Party has promoted revolutionary nostalgia and played down the strife of the Mao era. The anniversary celebrations, which culminate on Tuesday with a military parade in Beijing, have reinforced this rosy depiction of the past 70 years as a near-uninterrupted march of economic and technological progress, enshrining them through oversize floral displays in Beijing. On Monday, Mr. Xi paid his respects to Mao\u2019s preserved body in a mausoleum in Tiananmen Square.\n\nMr. Xi\u2019s recasting of China\u2019s history has left less and less room to reflect on traumas like the tens of millions who starved to death across the country from 1958 to 1960. That worries scholars who believe that the calamities of that time still offer lessons for China.", "description": "Seventy years after Mao founded the People\u2019s Republic, Xi Jinping visited Xinyang to rekindle revolutionary traditions.
