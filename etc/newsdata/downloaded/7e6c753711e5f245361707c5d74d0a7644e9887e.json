Now, a new documentary charts the movement\u2019s charismatic leaders, conflicts and future\n\nIn 1968, Aksel Lampmann was a teenager growing up in Soviet Estonia. That summer, he went to an international camp, where he met students from Czechoslovakia and began listening to the Beatles. He didn\u2019t understand the lyrics (\u201cNo one spoke English back then\u201d), but loved the sound. \u201cWe had no clue what they were singing about. What a strange vibration!\u201d\n\nHe learned guitar and grew his hair. By 1969, Lampmann had become a full-blown Soviet hippy. The iron curtain made a road trip to the US impossible, so he hitchhiked from his home in the Baltics to Crimea. \u201cOur lives were more colourful, more alive,\u201d he says. \u201cOther people didn\u2019t have the same encounters or emotions.\u201d\n\nLampmann is one of the stars of Soviet Hippies, a film by the Estonian writer and director Terje Toomistu about a lost period in Soviet history. The documentary explores a subculture that was inspired by the west yet distinctly homegrown \u2013 existing in a society shaped by communism and watched over by the KGB.\n\n\u201cIn the west, nobody was arrested simply for having long hair or wearing strange clothes,\u201d Toomistu explains. The USSR, by contrast, wanted complete control of its citizens\u2019 lives: how people worked, dressed, or even danced. Anyone who rejected the Homo sovieticus model could be in \u201cbig trouble\u201d, including having their hair forcibly cut.\n\nThe Soviet hippy movement emerged in Moscow and Leningrad around 1966 and 1967, in the early years of Leonid Brezhnev\u2019s rule. The first red hippies were the sons or daughters of the privileged Soviet nomenklatura \u2013 well-behaved kids from elite families. They had access to music from the capitalist world and to jeans. By the early 70s, the movement had grown sufficiently big and unruly to alarm the authorities \u2013 though it probably only ever numbered a few thousand, Toomistu says. The secret police began tailing the long-haired to school. In June 1971, the hippies were given permission to demonstrate against the Vietnam war outside the US embassy in Moscow.\n\nThis was a trap. The KGB rounded up and arrested demonstrators, with the goal of wiping out hippy culture. Some demonstrators were sent to psychiatric facilities and injected with insulin; others dispatched to the army and camps near the Chinese border. The film re-creates this grim clampdown and uses surveillance photos found in KGB archives in Lithuania.\n\nAccording to Lampmann, harassment by the police and KGB was common. \u201cOne of my close friends ended up in prison,\u201d he says. Hippies were persecuted under criminal rather than political law. They could find themselves sharing a cell with gangsters and murderers. To avoid arrest, Lampmann always kept his documents in perfect order.\n\nBy the late 70s, the hippies had developed a counterculture, with Russian slang and a music scene. There was what Toomistu calls \u201canalogue Facebook\u201d \u2013 notebooks listing names and numbers of contacts across the USSR, used by travellers seeking somewhere to crash for the night. This network is gloriously animated in the film, which features psychedelic drawings and cartoons.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ideas from the world outside \u2026 Vladimir Wiedemann practising yoga at home in Tallinn, Estonia, late 1970s.

It included hippies, dissidents, mystics, religious activists and human-rights campaigners. Some embraced spiritualism, others yoga and veganism. All rejected the Soviet regime and thus played a role in its eventual demise.\n\nWiedemann was exposed to rock\u2019n\u2019roll culture via Finnish TV and Radio Luxembourg, which he could pick up from his home in Estonia. \u201cThe iron curtain wasn\u2019t that strong,\u201d he says. Now based in London, Wiedemann wrote a book on hippies, Forbidden Union, which is currently running as a play, How Estonian Hippies Brought Down the Soviet Union!, on the Moscow stage...\n\nThe film features interviews with Wiedemann and other survivors from the \u201chairy underground\u201d, as Toomistu puts it. Most are men, still espousing hippy ideas and with beards and hair still flowing but grey. There are fewer Soviet female hippies, Toomistu says; many left the scene to have children. The movement\u2019s charismatic leaders are largely dead, often from drink and drugs.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u201cDown with the army, say no to war\u201d \u2026 Soviet Hippies.

Forbidden from travelling physically beyond the eastern bloc, Soviet hippies instead became \u201cpsychonauts\u201d, Toomistu says. They consumed weed from central Asia and the Caucasus, opium and poppy tea. Some drank Sopals, a Soviet cleaning detergent containing ether.\n\nToomistu grew up in post-Soviet Estonia. She was interested in the hippy scene as a teenager, and was a fan of Jim Morrison. She spent half a year in Russia as a student, and wrote a thesis about memory culture. The idea for the film came together after her own road trip in South America, she says. She is currently completing an anthropology PhD. There is little archive material on communist-era hippies, whom the Soviet press ignored, Toomistu says, erasing them from history. She retrieved a box of video footage of festivals and gatherings from a hippy who had to leave Russia in a hurry. In 2017, several of her subjects went to a hippy reunion held every year at Moscow\u2019s Tsaritsyno Park, to mark the 1971 demo busted by the KGB.\n\nThe reunion is poignant. Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and its 2014 annexation of Crimea divided opinion. Some hippies support Vladimir Putin and his idea of a great spiritual Russia. Others take a more traditional pacifist view that all war is bad. The film ends with Putin\u2019s police breaking up the party. It is a metaphor for state-hippy relations, now and then.", "description": "It was a subculture shaped by communism, inspired by the west \u2013 and watched by the KGB.
