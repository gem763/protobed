Fight to win! Forge exemplary conduct!\u201d\n\nReturning to the stage, Xi watched as lines of tanks, drones and missiles filed past.\n\nAmong the weapons on display were DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missiles, the backbone of China\u2019s nuclear deterrence, which can carry several nuclear warheads and reach as far as the United States.\n\n\u201cThey have highly advanced capabilities and the range to reach the United States from mainland China,\u201d said Nozomu Yoshitomi, professor at Japan\u2019s Nihon University and a retired major general of Japan\u2019s Ground Self-Defence Force.\n\n\u201cAlso, this is probably the first time they have shown us JL-2 submarine launched ballistic missiles in a parade. They don\u2019t have the range to reach the United States from waters around China, but they demonstrate China\u2019s second-strike capability.\u201d\n\nAfter the military parade, dancers and floats lauding China\u2019s history, achievements and its regions passed by, along with portraits of China\u2019s previous leaders and Xi himself, which got loud cheers.\n\nThe upheavals of the last seven decades \u2014 including the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution and bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators at Tiananmen Square in 1989 - did not get a mention.\n\nPerformers travel past Tiananmen Square with a float showing Chinese President Xi Jinping during the parade marking the 70th founding anniversary of People's Republic of China, on its National Day in Beijing, China October 1, 2019. REUTERS/Thomas Peter\n\nCAPITAL LOCKED DOWN\n\nThe more than two-hour parade of 15,000 soldiers, 70 floats and 100,000 civilians was a proud moment for many citizens, watching the spectacle across the country on television.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that familiar with the military, but I was stunned by them. I was covered in goosebumps,\u201d said Shanghai student Meng Yichen, watching at her university.\n\n\u201cI loved the women troops. I\u2019d not seen many before, so seeing so many this time was a great step forward.\u201d\n\nOne highlight for many Chinese was the appearance of Hong Kong policeman Lau Chak-kei waving a Chinese flag in the crowd. Lau is viewed as a hero in China after he pointed a shotgun loaded with beanbag rounds at hundreds of protesters besieging a Hong Kong police station on the night of July 30.\n\nLau was the fourth most searched for topic on China\u2019s Twitter-like Weibo service on Tuesday.\n\nXi remains broadly popular in China for his aggressive campaign against corruption and for propelling what is now the world\u2019s second-biggest economy to the forefront of global politics.\n\nBut he faces mounting challenges, notably in Hong Kong, which has been rocked by protests demanding greater democracy.\n\nThe former British colony was in lockdown on Tuesday with barricades in the city centre, shuttered stores and a heavy police presence. Embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam is in Beijing for the anniversary celebrations.\n\nAnother challenge is Chinese-claimed Taiwan, a free-wheeling democracy with little interest in being run by Beijing and which holds presidential elections in January.\n\nTaiwan on Tuesday condemned China\u2019s \u201cdictatorship\u201d, saying it was a threat to peace.\n\nThere are also restive minorities in Tibet and heavily Muslim Xinjiang, where China has faced international opprobrium for detaining up to one million ethnic Uighurs in what China calls a de-radicalisation scheme.\n\nUnderscoring another problem Xi faces, the parade took place under smoggy Beijing skies, despite region-wide efforts to curb emissions ahead of the anniversary.\n\nThe capital has been under tight security, with police telling residents of houses on the parade route not to look out their windows.\n\nMembers of the general public were not permitted to attend the parade, which was limited to a carefully vetted crowd.\n\nSlideshow (20 Images)\n\nOn a main road leading into central Beijing, several kilometres from Tiananmen Square, crowds gathered craning their necks to see.\n\nA roadsweeper urged a bystander to go home and watch on television.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t walk to Tiananmen Square. You can\u2019t go further than here,\u201d he said.", "description": "China celebrated its growing power and confidence with a big display of military hardware and goose-stepping troops in Beijing on Tuesday, overseen by President Xi Jinping who pledged peaceful development on Communist China's 70th birthday.", "authors": ["Ben Blanchard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435773623&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF90202", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
