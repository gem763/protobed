In fact, the Trump administration is already moving to launch another, closely related war with China, this time over financial flows.\n\nAlso read: Things aren\u2019t looking great for China\u2019s economy and it may only be getting worse\n\nIn a highly integrated world economy, trade and finance are two sides of the same coin. Cross-border trade transactions depend on a well-functioning international payments system and a robust network of financial institutions that are willing and able to issue credit. This financial infrastructure has been built around the U.S. dollar BUXX, -0.01% DXY, -0.06% \u2014 the most liquid and exchangeable international currency.\n\nExorbitant leverage\n\nThe dollar\u2019s position as the leading global reserve currency has long afforded the U.S. what Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, then France\u2019s finance minister, dubbed an \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d: America can print money at negligible cost and use it to purchase goods and services globally. But, with the opening up of global capital markets, the U.S. has also gained exorbitant leverage over the rest of the world.\n\nToday, some 80% of global trade is invoiced and settled in dollars, and most international transactions are ultimately cleared through the U.S. financial system. About 16 million payment orders transit daily through the Euro-American Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network.\n\nThus, U.S. restrictions on capital flows have more far-reaching effects than any trade tariff. And yet imposing them requires only invoking the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which allows the U.S. president to declare a national emergency and deploy a range of economic tools to respond to unusual or extraordinary threats.\n\nThe IEEPA has formed the legal basis for many sanctions programs, with presidents using it largely to block transactions and freeze assets. For example, in the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan issued an executive order under the IEEPA blocking all payments to Panama after a coup brought Manuel Noriega to power. (Funds intended for Panama were diverted to an escrow account established at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.)\n\nTrump \u2014 who has proved more than willing to cry \u201cemergency\u201d when it suits him \u2014 has cited the IEEPA many times, including to justify tariffs on imports from Mexico and to assert his authority to demand that U.S. companies \u201cimmediately start looking for an alternative to China.\u201d\n\nHoping to drive Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from office, he used the IEEPA to freeze the assets of state-owned oil company PDVSA.\n\nTrump has also forbidden U.S. investors from purchasing any debt owned by Venezuela\u2019s government or trading in shares of any entity in which it holds a controlling stake. Meanwhile, Trump has given Juan Guaid\u00f3, the U.S.-backed interim president, access to Venezuelan government assets held at the Fed since his predecessor, Barack Obama, froze them in 2015.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Trump has not imposed more sanctions than his forebears.\n\nMaximum damage\n\nBut he has devised particularly creative ways \u2014 often taking advantage of America\u2019s disproportionate financial leverage \u2014 to ensure that his administration\u2019s measures impose maximum damage, regardless of the effects on third parties.\n\nLikewise, Russia faces not only standard asset freezes and transaction blocks, but also limits on access to the U.S. banking system and exclusion from procurement contracts.\n\nChina, which is already struggling with declining exports, sluggish investment, weak consumption, and a growth slowdown, apparently is next. The Trump administration is reportedly considering restrictions on U.S. portfolio flows into China, including a ban on U.S. pension funds from investing in Chinese capital markets, delisting Chinese firms from U.S. stock exchanges, and limiting their access to stock indexes managed by U.S. firms.\n\nHow such policies would be implemented remains unclear; it would be no easy feat. But lacking a well-defined strategy has never stopped Trump before, especially when it comes to using economic levers to advance geopolitical objectives.\n\nThis approach may work in the short term, but it is sure to catch up to the U.S.\n\nTrump\u2019s repeated weaponization of the dollar undermines trust among holders of dollar-backed and U.S.-verified assets. How many foreign companies will be willing to list on a U.S. stock exchange knowing that they may be delisted at will? And how many non-U.S. residents will keep their assets in U.S. banks if any geopolitical skirmish can result in a freeze?\n\nAlternative currencies\n\nAs mistrust of the U.S. mounts, the drive for international monetary reform, which China has been advocating for the last decade, will gain momentum. This could mean expanding the international role of other currencies, such as the euro EURUSD, +0.0090% or, if China has its way, the renminbi (also known as the yuan USDCNH, +0.0113% .)\n\nIt could also lead to the creation of an alternate monetary system, centered on the needs of developing countries, especially oil and commodities exporters.\n\nBy broadening the nexus between economic interest and national security, Trump is encouraging the decoupling of the world\u2019s two largest economies and the emergence of a bipolar world order led by rival hegemons.\n\nBeyond fragmenting the trade and financial system that has underpinned the global economy for decades, the stage would be set for a devastating conflict.", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s repeated weaponization of the dollar undermines trust among holders of dollar-backed and U.S.-verified assets", "authors": ["Paola Subacchi"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT802_chain__ZG_20191022131524.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
