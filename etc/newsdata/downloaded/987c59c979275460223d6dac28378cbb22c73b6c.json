Indicts Turkish Bank on Charges of Evading Iran Sanctions", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department on Tuesday escalated pressure on Turkey by filing fraud and money laundering charges against the country\u2019s second-largest state-owned bank, accusing it of helping Iran evade United States sanctions.\n\nThe charges against the institution, Halkbank, came as the administration sought ways to project that it was taking a tough line with Turkey after President Trump effectively signaled this month that the United States would not stand in the way of Turkey\u2019s desire to send forces into northern Syria. Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to allow the military action has thrown the region into chaos and ignited an intense bipartisan backlash against him at home.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey had repeatedly raised the Halkbank case with Mr. Trump over the last year, urging the United States not to take further action, saying that to do so would unfairly expose Turkey to severe financial risks. One of the bank\u2019s top executives was convicted on similar charges last year, and the Justice Department has been reviewing since then whether to file further charges.\n\nThe charges were filed by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, which has been investigating the bank\u2019s role in what has been called the largest Iran sanctions violation in United States history, as billions of dollars\u2019 worth of gold and cash were illegally transferred to Iran in exchange for oil and gas.", "description": "The charges against Halkbank were announced at a time when President Trump, having allowed Turkish-backed forces to invade Syria, is looking to take a tougher stand against Turkey.", "authors": ["Eric Lipton"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/us/politics/15dc-turkeybank/15dc-turkeybank-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
