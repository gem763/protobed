The UK reportedly submitted the suggestion to the EU in recent Brexit talks.\n\nWith just weeks to go until the October 31 deadline, Brexit negotiations are at an impasse over the question of how to preserve the seamless border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after the UK leaves the EU.\n\nEx-prime minister Theresa May signed up to an insurance policy known as the backstop, which if triggered would keep the UK in a customs union with the EU, while Northern Ireland would effectively remain in the single market too.\n\nHowever, Johnson wants to backstop to be scrapped, and ruled out any possibility of either Northern Ireland or the whole of the UK remaining in a customs union with the EU after Brexit.\n\nIreland's Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney described \"customs clearance zones\" as a \"non-starter\" in a tweet on Monday evening, and called on the UK government to submit a \"serious\" proposal.\n\nJohnson on Tuesday morning denied that the leaked proposals were part of his Brexit plan.\n\nNon-Paper = Non-Starter. Time the EU had a serious proposal from the UK Govt if a #Brexit deal is to be achievable in October.

This means there can be border checks whatsoever once the UK has left the EU.\n\nHowever, Johnson on Tuesday said that new checks on the island of Ireland was the \"reality\" of Brexit.\n\nThe prime minister has said that checks can be kept to a minimum by using technology and trusted trader schemes.\n\nFormer Attorney General Dominic Grieve, supporter of the People's Vote campaign for a new Brexit referendum, said that the proposals reported on Monday night show that Johnson is not serious about negotiating a new deal.\n\n\"Proposals such as this leave one with the impression that Boris Johnson does not want any sort of deal,\" he said.\n\n\"Instead he seems to want someone else to blame for No Deal, and if that is the Irish government or the EU Commission, so much the better.\"", "description": "Leaked documents reveal that Johnson's government is preparing to erect customs posts in Northern Ireland after Brexit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9418/d60d6593c7ca48a7935f10b5232f1fb2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
