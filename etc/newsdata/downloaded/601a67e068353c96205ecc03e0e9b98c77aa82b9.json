Putting your life and putting yourself of reality television, the risks are obvious, they are well-known, especially if you have something to hide,' Andy explained in response to their Bravo tell-all interview aired Sunday night.\n\nNot on me: Andy Cohen said he has 'no guilt' about giving Teresa and Joe Giudice the spotlight of RHONJ when he sat down for Andy Radio after the couple's exclusive sit down on Bravo Sunday night\n\nReal Housewives Of New Jersey personalities Teresa and Joe both recently served time for mail, wire and bankruptcy fraud, although the courts let the couple serve their sentences in succession so their children were able to have at least one parent present during that time.\n\nTeresa served about 11 months in prison, starting her sentence in early 2015 and released just ahead of Christmas that same year.\n\nJoe subsequently served his 41-month sentence starting in March 2016 and was released this past May.\n\nConvicts: Real Housewives Of New Jersey personalities Teresa and Joe(above 2016) both recently served time for mail, wire and bankruptcy fraud\n\nLock up: Joe served a 41 month sentence starting March 2016 and was released this past May\n\nBut after his release from prison, Giudice - a permanent resident but Italian national who moved to the US as a child - was put in ICE detention after his green card was revoked in light of him being convicted of 'a crime of moral turpitude' or an 'aggravated felony.'\n\nAfter a trying six-month stay in immigration detention, Joe requested to be sent back to Italy to wait for the final decision of his immigration plight.\n\nDuring his sit down with Andy on Sunday night Joe explained his decision to go back 'home.'\n\nNope: During his sit down with Andy on Sunday night Joe explained his decision to go back to Italy, saying 'There was no way I was gonna do another year in that county prison [with ICE]'\n\n'There was no way I was gonna do another year in that county prison there,' noted Joe. 'Being in there is like having your head in a panini press. Or in a vise.'\n\nLeaving the US was tough, he added: 'I'm happy that I'm out, but sad at the same time. I'm sad that I'm not with my family, I'm sad that I'm not with my wife, of course, and with all my friends and everything back at home. That's where my life is. It's not here, it's there.'\n\nGuidice's final appeal is still pending.", "description": "'This is a voluntary process.
