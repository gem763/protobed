Chinese bonds are likely to be included in other major benchmarks.\n\n\"There's bound to be more inflows into China and it's an attractive bond market. Historically it's been a relatively stable currency, it still sports a current account surplus.\"\n\nIndonesia is another country catching the money manager's eye. The push by President Joko Widodo to reform the economy of Australia's northern neighbour is seen as a positive, so too the prospect for further interest rate cuts.\n\n\"They have a structural reform effort, they have relatively high growth, they're relatively insulated from global trade, and they have relatively high real rates, so for us that's one of the more attractive bond markets to be in,\" Mr Banasiak said.\n\nPGIM likes Indonesian government bonds with five- to seven-year maturities.\n\nAmong emerging market currencies, it's the Russian rouble that has been a \"standout outperfomer\". It's up about 8 per cent against the US dollar despite the weakness in oil prices.\n\n\"The current account of Russia is at 7 per cent of GDP \u2013 it is as high as it was back in 2007 when oil prices went north of $US100.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The current account surplus is the dominant factor in keeping the currency stable, so it's no longer the fluctuation in the price of oil.\"\n\nAnd the hryvnia? Well, it's rallied around 11 per cent against the US dollar from its January lows.\n\nThere's a new populist president but the country is keen to extend its IMF program, which could lead to improvements in Ukraine's economy.\n\n\"A lot of the conditions that are demanded by the IMF, that includes an increase in productivity, labour reforms, and opening the market to have more access to private property, will go a long way to increasing productivity and increasing the potential GDP of the country,\" said Mr Banasiak.", "description": "PGIM Fixed Income's Mariusz Banasiak says Chinese bonds are \"attractive\", is upbeat on Indonesia, and sees opportunity in Russia and Ukraine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6222%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1468%2C$y_650/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d367c8337057150d0c96487061280eb30dcdb1b5", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
