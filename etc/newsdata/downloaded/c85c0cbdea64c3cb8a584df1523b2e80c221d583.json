But now she is back on screen in Netflix's Politician, written by husband Brad Falchuk\n\nBut it involves Ryan\u2019s frequent professional partner Brad Falchuk, the writer-director-producer who is in fact Gwyneth\u2019s new husband.\n\n\u2018I did it because I was sleeping with the writer!\u2019 she laughs.\n\nBut it was indeed her relationship with Brad that got her to sign up.\n\n\u2018Brad was writing the show and he kept telling me I was inspiring the part.\n\n'Then he said, more seriously, \u201cI\u2019m writing this for you.\u201d I told him I couldn\u2019t do it because I was working full-time on Goop, and that there was no way I could take time out to do a TV show.\n\n'So he suggested not making it too big a part. I said, \u201cOK.\u201d\u2019\n\nWhich was when Ryan Murphy, the TV writer behind such TV hits as Glee, American Horror Story and Nip/Tuck, stepped in.\n\n\u2018He called me and said that he really wanted me to do it. So I read it and I thought it was prescient, a really interesting comment on where we are right now in our society in America.\n\n'Then they said they would try to make the work fit in around my job, so lo and behold, I\u2019m in a TV show.\u2019\n\nGwyneth Paltrow plays Georgina Hobart, the free-spirited mother of an aspiring teenaged politician in black comedy The Politician, opposite Ben Platt as Payton Hobart (pictured)\n\nAnd what a TV show.\n\nThe Politician is the slyly satirical tale of Payton Hobart (Ben Platt), a hyper-intelligent but emotionally vacuous rich kid who\u2019s known since the age of seven that he\u2019s destined to become President of the United States.\n\nThe first rung on the ladder is running for Student Body President at his exclusive high school in wealthy Santa Barbara, California.\n\nTo do this, and secure the spot at Harvard that will continue his trajectory, Payton will have to outwit his ruthless classmates without sacrificing his carefully crafted image.\n\nWhen his rival \u2013 handsome, likeable River (David Corenswet) \u2013 gallops past him in the popularity polls, Payton decides to make himself seem more attractive by selecting someone \u2018undeniably real\u2019 as a running mate, the sweet but sick Infinity Jackson (Zoey Deutch).\n\nIt\u2019s a hilarious but terrifyingly accurate caricature of both the American political and education systems.\n\nThe last theme is especially timely in view of the recent scandal in which a number of rich Los Angeles parents, including Desperate Housewives\u2019 Felicity Huffman, were found to have bribed people to secure their children a place at their preferred college.\n\n\u2018The show does a really interesting job of examining white privilege,\u2019 says Gwyneth, 47.\n\nIt was indeed her relationship with husband Brad Falchuk - a writer-director-producer - that encouraged Gwyneth to sign up to The Politician. Pictured, the couple last week\n\n\u2018Rich people have always had an unfair advantage over less privileged people, and Brad feels very personally about how wrong that is.\n\n'Just as an example, he came up with a storyline where my character paid for my kids to get into college, well before the scandal broke.\n\n'So it was fascinating he\u2019d been thinking about the responsibility of people of privilege.\n\n'What is the responsibility, where does the line get drawn and where does it stop?\u2019\n\nShe has greatly enjoyed working with her on-screen son, played by 26-year-old Ben Platt of Dear Evan Hansen and Pitch Perfect fame, who\u2019s also an executive producer on the series.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s an incredibly driven person. He wanted to see every detail of everything, and he really threw himself into it.\n\n'It\u2019s great to see a young person who has that much conviction.\u2019\n\nBack at home, her real-life children Apple and Moses are now in their teens.\n\n\u2018Which means I\u2019m an old woman!\u2019 she laughs.\n\n\u2018I love having kids this age. I have genuinely adored every stage of parenting through all the different ages, it\u2019s been the most rewarding \u2013 sometimes the most challenging \u2013 thing ever.\n\n'I have a 13-year-old and a 15-year-old, and I\u2019m so looking forward to having adult children.\u2019\n\nGwyneth snapped this photo of ex-husband Chris Martin (left) with husband Brad Falchuk\n\nIt\u2019s now five years since she and Coldplay singer Chris Martin infamously announced their split as \u2018conscious uncoupling\u2019, and she says, as far as she can see, their children are doing fine with the change in their lives.\n\n\u2018They\u2019ve managed to come through the divorce pretty OK \u2013 although I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve messed them up in other ways! My ex-husband and I called what we did \u201cuncoupling\u201d because we wanted to do it in a way that\u2019d be the least traumatic for the children.\n\n'The \u201cconscious\u201d part was about trying to do it in a way that was maybe different to how other people had.\n\n\u2018It took a lot of work but it really paid off because Chris and I are still very close.\n\n'We remain a family even though we\u2019re not a couple \u2013 the kids appreciate that we\u2019re still a family too.\n\n'I was very lucky that my ex-husband and I wanted to stay close.\n\n'We\u2019re still close friends, and it\u2019s because of that we\u2019ve been able to move through our lives with other partners and feel that we\u2019re adding to the family, instead of having it become divisive or difficult.\n\n'I recognise it\u2019s unusual, but I feel proud we\u2019ve been able to do it.\u2019\n\nGwyneth revealed her lifestyle brand Goop which is valued at around \u00a3200 million, has 250 employees. Pictured, the actress at the Emmy awards in Los Angeles last month\n\nWhile Chris has gone on to long-term romances with actresses Jennifer Lawrence and Dakota Johnson, Gwyneth almost immediately began dating Brad, whom she married in the Hamptons last September, although they didn\u2019t move in together until quite recently.\n\n\u2018First I uncoupled, then I coupled!\u2019 she laughs.\n\n\u2018We decided for the first year to keep our separate residences and make the transition for the kids a bit more gentle. It\u2019s worked out very well.\n\n'We\u2019ve finally moved in together. Of course there are always complications, but it\u2019s going pretty well.\u2019\n\nAlso going pretty well is Goop, which despite some very negative press is a thriving lifestyle brand valued at about \u00a3200 million.\n\n\u2018We have 250 employees, 80 per cent women,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018When I started I had no idea what I was doing, and I didn\u2019t imagine it\u2019d become what it has.\n\n'I can be a demanding boss as I\u2019m a perfectionist and I don\u2019t like it when we make the same mistakes more than once.\n\n'But a work environment needs to feel collaborative, creative and kind, and the work/life balance needs to be good, particularly because we have so many working mothers here.\u2019\n\nShe\u2019s been thinking a lot about the work environment since the start of the #MeToo movement, another feature of modern life she helped pioneer by being among the first actresses to publicly accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment.\n\n\u2018I was honoured to play a small part,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018I was ready to tell my story and support other women telling theirs.\n\n'It was the right time. I wasn\u2019t sure anything would change because it never had, but society and the world were ready for a new movement.\u2019\n\nSo, Gwyneth Paltrow the politician? \u2018God, no!\u2019 she shudders.\n\n\u2018Yes, we\u2019re in a very polarised moment, and nobody\u2019s listening to anybody else and it\u2019s causing a lot of pain. But no, I\u2019ll never run for office.\u2019\n\nThe Politician is on Netflix now.", "description": "Actress Gwyneth Paltrow , 47, stars as Georgina Hobart in Netflix's The Politician.
