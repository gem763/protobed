The final update is set to include 59 new characters ranging from falafels to mechanical limbs and sign language gestures\n\nIn 2018, a proposal was submitted to Unicode to add five more different skin tones to the emoji of two people standing next to each other and holding hands.\n\n'The lack of representation for diverse racial identities is a significant issue in an increasingly globalized society,' the proposal stated.\n\n'With this problem gaining increased media attention, and since efforts have already been made to ensure the representation of non-heteronormative sexual identities, now seems an appropriate cultural moment to give people the opportunity to see themselves in the emoji world.\n\n'Moreover, recent years have seen a large spike in the number of interracial couples and marriages. This ought to be recognized, especially given the current political environment,' it continued.\n\nHowever, one of the most notable additions is the variety of skin tones that have been added to people holding hands, which has been a year in the making. In 2018, a proposal was submitted to Unicode to add five more different skin tones to the emoji of two people standing next to each other and holding hands\n\nAnd popular dating app Tinder was listed as one of the co-creators of the proposal.\n\nTinder partnered with Ohanian, who is married to Serena Williams, in March 2018, saying at the time: 'Emojis are the universal language of the digital age...It may seem like there's an emoji for everyone, but that's not the case.\n\n'While emojis for people of color and emojis for same-sex couples both became a reality in 2015, one group of people is still excluded from emoji representation: interracial couples. Isn\u2019t it time all love was represented?'\n\nAlso adding to the diverse set are several accessibility-related emojis such as ear with hearing aid, deaf person, mechanical arm and leg, person with cane, person in wheelchair, guide dog, wheelchair (manual and motorized) and probing cane\n\nNow, users can expect to see this proposal in the next update.\n\nThere are now a range of interracial couples and interracial same-sex couples to choose from.\n\nAlso adding to the diverse set are several accessibility-related emojis such as ear with hearing aid, deaf person, mechanical arm and leg, person with cane, person in wheelchair, guide dog, wheelchair (manual and motorized) and probing cane.\n\nBut there are also the standard food and animals as well.\n\nTHE BIRTH OF THE EMOJI Shigetaka Kurita invented Emoji in 1998 while working for DoCoMo, a large Japanese mobile communication company. The goal was to develop a way for mobile phone users to send pictures back and forth without using much data. It all started in Japan, when users started to send pictures as a way to communicate. This was a time when mobile phones were young, so providers were already struggling to to support 80 million users. The idea was to create a one character 'code' that would display as an icon on the other person's device. DoKoMo i-mode, a mobile provider in Japan, was the first firm to allow users to add pictures of common used emoticons to their text messages.
