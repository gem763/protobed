The disgraced film producer was also a prominent Democratic Party donor, giving substantial sums to The Clinton Foundation as well as Bill Clinton\u2019s legal defense fund during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton, did you have any concern for your husband\u2019s victims? And what about HW victims? No? Didn\u2019t think so,\u201d added McGowan, who was one of the first women to accuse Weinstein of sexual assault.\n\nHillary Clinton, did you have any concern for your husband\u2019s victims?

What I do know is simple: I\u2019d already rejected a Weinstein Co proposed doc about the election before talking to Ronan. If HW misrepresented facts, it wouldn\u2019t be the 1st time,\u201d Merrill said.\n\nI genuinely respect Ronan\u2019s work, but have no idea what Weinstein was saying to people to save himself.
