The discovery was made a short time later at the Waterglade Industrial Park after a call was made to emergency services.\n\nPolice are also questioning Joanna and Thomas Maher on suspicion of people trafficking and 39 counts of manslaughter.\n\nHours earlier they told the Mirror they previously owned the Scania lorry cab.\n\nThe Mahers said they sold the Bulgarian-registered vehicle a year ago to a company in Ireland.\n\nMr Maher said he contacted police after news of the lorry deaths broke.\n\nPolice revealed on Friday they had also detained a 48-year-old man at Stansted Airport on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people.\n\nPolice investigating on Friday night declined to speculate on reports of the suspected Vietnamese victims.\n\nSome Vietnamese families have shared their fears their relatives were in the lorry container.\n\nThey included the distraught family of one woman thought to be among the dead who sent a harrowing final text message to her mother late on Tuesday night.\n\nPham Thi Tra My, 26, wrote: \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mum.
