And her post did just that.\n\nThe hashtag she used, #LilySeesTheJonasBrothersChallenge2019, went viral \u2014 even Pennsylvania Representative Scott Perry shared her post.\n\n\"Our good friend Lily is fighting for her life in Hershey tonight and so badly wanted to see the Jonas Brothers tomorrow night at Hersheypark, but can't because of her urgent treatment,\" he wrote on Facebook Friday. \"If there is anyway for them to visit her, we are lifting up her hopes and our prayers for help.\"\n\nThe Jonas Brothers saw the posts and couldn't help but stop in to visit Jordan at Penn State Children's Hospital before their concert.\n\nThe Milton S.
