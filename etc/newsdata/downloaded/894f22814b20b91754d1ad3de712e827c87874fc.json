As numbers of the species have increased, this marks the fifth year running that the pups have been born there.\n\nPhoto credit: South Walney Nature Reserve More\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, a single seal was a rare sight around Walney island but gradually, over the years, hundreds have come to the reserve as a safe place to raise their young.\n\nThe fluffy white pups are born between September and December. After they have been nurtured by their mothers, the young seals will shed their thick fur before heading out to sea to forage for themselves.\n\n\"We're really excited to see our first seal pup of the season at South Walney Nature Reserve and we hope to have a few more pups appear over the next month or two. Sadly, we also spotted a still born pup, which is not uncommon in large seal colonies,\" Dr Emily Baxter, Cumbria Wildlife Trust\u2019s Senior Marine Conservation Officer says.\n\nPhoto credit: Cumbria Wildlife Trust More\n\n\"This seal colony is the only place that seals haul out in large numbers on to the beach in the North West and is a precious new colony that has grown rapidly over the last ten years. Staff, apprentices and our placement students are all involved in surveying the seals \u2013 it\u2019s a real team effort. In February this year 483 seals were counted, the highest number yet.\"\n\nOn the Walney nature reserve, interaction with seals is off-limits to humans to protect the young. \"We are seeing disturbance coming from kayakers and other boats coming too close to seals resting on the beach. When seals are disturbed, they flee into the sea using up important energy stores. It is especially important that mums and pups are not disturbed while mums are still feeding,\" Emily continues.\n\nWhile visitors are forbidden to take a look, you can see the seal's progress on the live video feed below. It's incredibly sweet!\n\nWATCH LIVE VIDEO\n\n\n\nLike this article?
