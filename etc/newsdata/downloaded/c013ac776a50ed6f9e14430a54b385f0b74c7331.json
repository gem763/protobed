Best known for playing Zoe Tate in the long-running serial drama, Leah featured in plenty of huge storylines, and remained in the eponymous village for 16 years. As a result, she won a place in the hearts of fans of the ITV soap.\n\nWhile plenty of Zoe\u2019s biggest moments occurred during the \u201990s and after, the character actually made her first appearance back 1989, while she was studying at university. After graduation, she was determined to find employment as a vet, and she wasted little time in doing so, nabbing a job at a practice up in Hotten.\n\nOver the next 16 years, she would go on to feature in some of the show\u2019s most iconic moments of all time. From coming out as gay \u2014 and thus making history as the first lesbian in the soap\u2019s history \u2014 to her steamy and passionate affair with Charity Tate (Emma Atkins), Zoe was at the heart of plenty of hard-hitting narratives during her 16 years in the village.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, Zoe made Emmerdale history and, for that, she\u2019ll be forever in the minds of soap lovers all across the nation. With that in mind, let\u2019s reflect on some her finest moments from her time in the village.\n\nComing out\n\nAs noted earlier, Zoe famously came out to dad Frank (Norman Bowler) back in 1993. The scene in which she did so was a game-changer for telly, as it meant that she was not only the first lesbian character in the history of Emmerdale, but rather the first lesbian character in British soap \u2014 period.\n\nAfter realising she wanted more out of her friendship with Archie Brooks (Tony Pitts), Zoe decided to take their relationship further. However, it didn\u2019t take her long to realise that this wasn\u2019t the right direction for her. Not long afterwards, she revealed that she was gay to dad Frank \u2014 who famously struggled to process the news.\n\nZoe Tate was one of soap\u2019s first LGBTQ+ icons, and that in itself is one of the reasons why the character remains so beloved.\n\nHer affair with Charity Tate\n\nZoe\u2019s brother Chris (Peter Amory) began dating Charity (Emma Atkins) in the early noughties, and it\u2019s safe to say that Zoe wasn\u2019t in the least bit pleased with her siblings choice of companion. Matters were made worse when he took it upon himself to move Charity into the house, so \u2014 in an attempt to get the young woman out of both their lives for good \u2014 Zoe proceeded to offer her money to finish her relationship. However, Charity refused to do so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn typical Emmerdale fashion, hate soon turned to passion as Zoe and Charity embarked on an affair \u2014 one which remains one of the most renowned dalliances in the soap\u2019s long history.\n\nCharity eventually put an end to said relationship when Zoe became rather possessive. However, like all good soaps, blackmail ensued as Zoe recorded Charity discussing her extra-marital activities and threatened to let her brother hear the truth if she didn\u2019t agree to sign a prenup.\n\nSchizophrenia diagnosis\n\nIn 2002, Zoe was sectioned and subsequently diagnosed with schizophrenia in a storyline that was critically praised. After her diagnosis, she discovered that she was pregnant with Scott Windsor\u2019s (Ben Freeman) baby, but had no recollection of sleeping with him.\n\nShe spent a lot of time debating over what to do for the best in regards to her pregnancy and, eventually she decided against having an abortion. Instead, she decided she would carry on with the pregnancy and then, upon the child\u2019s birth, she would put the baby up for adoption.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not how things transpired, as she later decided to keep her baby girl, and named her Jean.\n\nTestifying against Charity\n\nAfter discovering that he had an inoperable brain tumour back in 2003, Chris decided he would use what little time he had left to get revenge on those who\u2019d scorned him \u2014 and Charity was without a doubt at the very top of that list, as she had not only cheated on him with Zoe, but had also been sleeping with Cain (Jeff Hordley) behind his back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an attempt to ensure Charity was left with nothing, Chris proceeded to waste every last penny of his fortune, before he poisoned himself and framed Charity for his murder.\n\nHowever, it soon came to light that Zoe was aware of her brother\u2019s plan. Despite Charity\u2019s best efforts, Zoe remained shtum about the truth, and later testified in court that Charity was a murderer \u2014 an act which resulted in Charity being sent to prison!\n\nHer iconic exit\n\nSoap exits are usually sublime, and Zoe certainly had one of the greatest Emmerdale has ever seen, as the character exited with a bang \u2014 quite literally!\n\nYes, after standing trial for the attempted murder of Scott, she packed up all her belongings from Home Farm and made plans to leave with Home Farm\u2019s estate manager Callum Rennie (Andrew Whipp).\n\nBefore departing, however, the pair decided to break a gas pipe and set it on a timer, before hightailing it out of there just as the King clan arrived. Home Farm then exploded into smithereens as Zoe and Callum watch on, before they head out of the village.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Zoe was at the centre of some of Emmerdale's greatest storylines.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/zoe-tates-best-moments-in-emmerdale-as-leah-bracknell-dies_1571252385.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
