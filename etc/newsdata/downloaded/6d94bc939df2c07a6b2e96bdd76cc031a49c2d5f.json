Jeremy, Jo, the clock is ticking. The SNP is ready to act. Are you?\u201d\n\nContrasting Westminster\u2019s \u201cdysfunctional, dangerous\u201d government with the SNP\u2019s administration at Holyrood, Blackford praised Sturgeon\u2019s \u201coutstanding leadership\u201d of the party and in her role as first minister.\n\nBlackford dismissed the Queen\u2019s speech, to be held on Monday, as \u201csimple electioneering,\u201d adding that SNP MPs were ready to vote it down, and urging Labour and Liberal Democrats to do likewise.\n\nWhile commending the work of his SNP colleague Joanna Cherry and others challenging Johnson\u2019s government through the courts, he added that \u201cthis perpetual cycle of court cases and parliamentary defeats \u2013 while it is effective \u2013 is no way to run a country\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe should not have to rely on the courts to solve our problems, or on arcane Westminster procedures to find ways to block the government. We should not be tolerating this Tory government in office at all.\u201d\n\nBlackford was also applauded by delegates as he cautioned them that only a legally-constituted independence referendum would be accepted by voters and by EU member states. \u201cPlan Bs are by definition second best,\u201d Blackford said.\n\nSturgeon to request fresh independence referendum 'within weeks' Read more\n\nImmediately after Blackford\u2019s warnings, moves by a small group of rebels who believe the SNP should keep the option of demanding independence without a legally-constituted referendum were heavily defeated by the party leadership.\n\nChris McEleny, an SNP councillor in Inverclyde, said the party needed to have that so-called \u201cplan B\u201d option in reserve since Boris Johnson was expected to reject Sturgeon\u2019s calls for a section 30 order authorising a referendum. He said that if Scotland voted for a majority of pro-independence MPs at the next election, that should be enough to trigger talks with the Westminster government.\n\nMcEleny\u2019s measure is backed privately by a number of SNP parliamentarians close to Alex Salmond, the former party leader, including Angus MacNeil, the SNP MP for the Western Isles. The conference overwhelmingly defeated the proposal.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Sturgeon said that any Westminster leader seeking SNP support should \u201cnot bother picking up the phone\u201d if they were not prepared to grant Holyrood the legal powers to hold a second independence referendum.\n\nOn Saturday, shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, insisted that there would be \u201cno pacts, no deals, no understanding\u201d with the SNP for supporting a Labour-led national unity government. McDonnell stunned colleagues in August and contradicted party policy when he suggested at an Edinburgh festival fringe event that Labour should allow Holyrood to stage a second independence referendum if MSPs vote for one.\n\nSturgeon told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cI don\u2019t favour coalitions. We would favour a progressive-type alliance. But I would say this to Jeremy Corbyn, or any Westminster leader who is looking to the SNP for support, if you don\u2019t accept Scotland\u2019s right to choose at our choosing \u2013 don\u2019t even bother picking up the phone to me.\u201d\n\nSpeaking as a Panelbase poll for the Sunday Times showed that support for independence had risen to 50%, she added that she will request another independence referendum from the prime minister in \u201ca matter of weeks\u201d.", "description": "Ian Blackford calls on other opposition leaders to back vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson", "authors": ["Severin Carrell", "Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/228866f238138a5366c3250f58cca19a950c94cf/0_310_4924_2955/master/4924.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9d75880b103b0f05ff3173699b2ff156", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
