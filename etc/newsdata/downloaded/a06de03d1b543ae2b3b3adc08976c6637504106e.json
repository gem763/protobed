Casa Olivetta sleeps up to nine people and is set on almost three hectares of olive grove in the Valle D\u2019Itria, about eight minutes\u2019 drive from Ostuni, \u201cthe white city\u201d (citt\u00e0 bianca) that sits atop the heel of Italy\u2019s boot, near the Adriatic Sea.\n\nThe piazza in the \u201cwhite city\u201d of Ostuni. Antoine Doyen\n\n\u201cOstuni is as white as a pearl,\u201d says Dinnigan. \u201cWe fell for it instantly.\u201d\n\nThe area produces high-quality olive oil and wine, and over the past decade has acquired the reputation of \u201cthe new Tuscany\u201d in terms of foreigners moving into crumbling old homes for a sea change \u2013 although Puglia is far more rugged and wild than Tuscany.\n\nDinnigan\u2019s gradual drift towards Italy didn\u2019t surprise me. We originally met in 1996 at the first-ever Australian Fashion Week. When I moved to Sydney less than a year later, she immediately invited me to dinner at her home. It was a warm-hearted gesture that I greatly appreciated.\n\nDinnigan had won back her freedom in 2013, when she shuttered her fashion empire to spend more time with her young family.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve witnessed her courage. There\u2019s not much Dinnigan won\u2019t have a go at doing. She created a fashion empire from scratch in the early 1990s, and by 1995 had become the first Australian designer to launch and show a ready-to-wear collection in Paris. Her designs were stocked by Barneys New York and Harvey Nichols in London and Hong Kong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when she and Cocks announced they were going to relocate to Rome five years ago, no one was less surprised than me. Dinnigan had won back her freedom in 2013, when she shuttered her fashion empire to spend more time with her young family, and since then they have flitted back and forth between Italy and Australia with relative ease.\n\n\u201cAfter Hunter was born [in 2012], I realised my fashion life was too intense,\u201d says Dinnigan. \u201cHe was three months old the first time I had to take him to Paris. As a baby, my daughter Estella was a good sleeper on flights; he\u2019s always been the opposite. Estella would stick to her feed times; Hunter was just a feeding machine. She would sit there drawing; he was running around under all the dresses.\u201d\n\nDinnigan, her husband Bradley Cocks and their son Hunter in Casa Olivetta's garden. Antoine Doyen\n\nSomething had to give. Almost as an unintended segue away from the fashion world, Dinnigan flexed her latent interior-design muscle and developed an uncanny knack for flipping property, starting with a number of homes in Australia.\n\nMy move into interior design was organic. I\u2019m a solutions person: it\u2019s about finding solutions to make the proportions right. \u2014 Collette Dinnigan\n\nIn 2016, she sold her Watson\u2019s Bay home, an old Masonic Temple, for $9 million, having bought it for $6.25 million in early 2015. Dinnigan and Cocks then purchased Springfield Farm in the Southern Highlands, paying $4.5 million for the sprawling eight-hectare estate. They sold it in October last year for $7.25 million, then laid down $3.5 million for Alderley Edge, an 1880s home on two hectares near Bowral.\n\n\u201cMy move into interior design was organic,\u201d says Dinnigan. \u201cI\u2019m a solutions person: it\u2019s about finding solutions to make the proportions right. I\u2019d always done up my own houses, then my first professional commission was to design two coastal penthouses at Bannisters by the Sea in Mollymook.\u201d\n\nCocks and Hunter poolside at Casa Olivetta. Antoine Doyen\n\nTo date, Dinnigan\u2019s international interior design focus has been more of a private one \u2013 ensuring that wherever her family was living in Rome had her touch.\n\nOver the years, they\u2019ve rented properties all over the city to get a feel for it. At one point the family had a penthouse overlooking ancient ruins at Largo Argentina, where Julius Caesar was murdered, and for a time they lived close to the Spanish Steps, before they settled in the central city neighbourhood of Monti.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBradley and I first thought about living in Italy because we wanted a road to discover together,\u201d says Dinnigan, adding that he speaks the language way more fluently than she does.\n\nCocks works across special projects in the management and marketing of luxury hotels, including what he terms \u201chotel rescue and babysitting\u201d through his Goodtrip luxury hotel consultancy business, which he founded in 2014 (a recent project was the hotel castle Castello di Vicarello in Tuscany).\n\nBut while Cocks might be the family interpreter, Dinnigan quips \u201cmy food-shopping Italian tops his\u201d.\n\nDinnigan shops at a fresh produce market in Ostuni. Antoine Doyen\n\nLife for her in Rome, as you can imagine, is very much about the food. \u201cI tend to entertain with early dinners on Sunday nights. You think Rome is all about eating late, but the people we know have busy weeks \u2013 they travel a lot or they have kids \u2013 so our terrace is perfect.\u201d\n\nAs you might expect of a creative with an eye for colour, Dinnigan responds to the seasonality of the produce in Italy, and also the floral scents and shades. For months, Rome\u2019s residents smell the orange blossom in the streets, then wake up to see the wisteria in bloom, followed by the jacarandas.\n\n\u201cJust the sight of jasmine crowning an ancient church door, or a cat sunning itself among the ruins makes me happy,\u201d Dinnigan says. \u201cI feel more relaxed in Rome. I spend a lot of time walking around, just \u2018being\u2019. I enjoy the actual living of our life here.\u201d\n\nRenovating and fitting out Casa Olivetta in Puglia has been a two-year labour of love. Antoine Doyen\n\nFinally she\u2019s got the time to get to know the local neighbourhood, from the family-run restaurants to the fishmonger and fruit sellers she passes as she walks seven-year-old Hunter to the bus that picks up children from all over Rome to drop them at a progressive school on the city\u2019s leafy outskirts.\n\nMeanwhile, Dinnigan\u2019s 15-year-old daughter Estella (from a previous relationship) has chosen to stay in Australia at boarding school. She\u2019s a keen horsewoman and \u201cit\u2019s a little hard to have horses in an apartment in the centre of Rome,\u201d says Dinnigan, adding Estella loves Italy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe return to Australia to see Estella, and in the long holidays she flies here. We make sure we have nice mother-daughter time, such as heading north to learn about the food in Piedmont, which has a cuisine unlike the rest of Italy. It\u2019s all about butter, truffles and making pasta with more eggs than you can imagine.\u201d\n\nWhile the tempo of life for Dinnigan may have slowed in Rome, the hectic urban pace that comes implicit with the \u201cCapital of the World\u201d (as Roman poet Lucan called it in the first century) remains.\n\nDinnigan in her kitchen at Casa Olivetta after a visit to Ostuni\u2019s local markets. Antoine Doyen\n\nEnter Puglia, which is all about heat and really slowing down. The small family responded immediately to the dry, southern coastal region on their first visit \u2013 it felt like how Dinnigan had always imagined Capri was in the 1950s. The area has the same lazy grottoes and crystal-clear water; seafood restaurants on the cliffs selling freshly caught grilled fish; warm balmy nights on which the town turns out to promenade.\n\n\u201cI fell in love with the sun-bleached white walls and the \u2018cucina povera\u2019 [food of the peasants] based on tomatoes, capers, broccoli, beans, olive oil, parsley, garlic \u2013 literally everything I adore on a plate,\u201d she says.\n\nThe couple initially didn\u2019t plan to buy a house there, and when they spotted the then-rundown Casa Olivetta for sale they didn\u2019t buy it immediately. Dinnigan did her homework and looked at hundreds of rambling old local ruins before returning to where they had started.\n\nLike Capri in the '50s: Dinnigan and Cocks enjoy oysters at Il Principe del Mare Ristoro in Savelletri. Antoine Doyen\n\nAfter purchasing Casa Olivetta in late 2016, they began the two-year process of renovating and fitting it out.\n\n\u201cWe had to do everything,\u201d says Dinnigan, although help was at hand in the form of fellow Australian Rob Potter-Sanders, owner of Masseria Trapan\u00e0, a 16th-century farmhouse further south near Lecce, which he had turned into an elegant eight-suite hotel. \u201cRob\u2019s local knowledge and support has been incredible.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, Casa Olivetta comprises one main building with a large rooftop area, a separate guest villa, two gazebos and an outdoor pizza oven. All buildings are in pale limestone brick, with traditional masseria (farmhouse) stone courtyards and reclaimed antico terracotta tiles for inside floors, finished with lime-washed white walls and contrasting timber.\n\n\u201cThere are elements of Italian style that I still cannot get,\u201d jokes Dinnigan. \u201cTiles painted in blue and yellow? No. I can\u2019t do a diagonal tile on the floor unless it\u2019s black and white Carrara marble, very graphic.\n\n\u201cI love symmetry. There are a lot of places that absolutely do not rely on that here and, while I like to see it, I\u2019m not going to live with it.\u201d\n\nAs for Dinnigan\u2019s interpretation of the Puglia aesthetic, you\u2019ll just have to visit.\n\nAt a glance\n\nCasa Olivetta Set to open in April 2020, the villa sits on an olive-producing farm in Puglia with gated entry. It includes four bedrooms, four bathrooms, a large chef\u2019s kitchen and indoor and shaded outdoor dining areas. There\u2019s also a furnished rooftop lounging area and a large pool with day beds and a gazebo.\n\nCasa Olivetta sits among the olive groves of Valle D\u2019Itria. Antoine Doyen\n\nGetting around Brindisi Airport to Ostuni is 40 kilometres; flight time from Rome to Brindisi is just over an hour. Bari Airport is roughly an hour\u2019s drive from Casa Olivetta. It\u2019s useful to hire a car in this region as getting around is tricky and private transfers are expensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDinnigan\u2019s insider guide to Puglia\n\nAt table Book a spot at Masseria Moroseta, a gorgeous old Pugliese farmhouse overlooking the Adriatic Sea near Ostuni. It also offers cooking classes.\n\nCeramics A visit to Grottaglie, a lovely little ceramics town about a 40 minute drive from Ostuni, is essential. I buy from Nicolo Fasano Ceramiches; ask for Franco and say I sent you. While you're there, go to nearby Alfredo Ristorante on Via Santa Sofia and eat whatever they tell you.\n\nAn organic repast at Masseria Moroseta, near Ostuni. Antoine Doyen\n\nCloth For sheets, linens and other soft home furnishings, I love family run Tessitura Calabrese near Lecce. You'll find everything you need for bed, bath and table.\n\nEat & swim Heading further south, I love the seaside village of Tricase. Eat at Taverna del Porto, a tiny seafood place on Via Cristoforo Colombo, but make sure you book. At the very southern tip of Italy's heel is Santa Maria di Leuca \u2013 take a boat trip and your swimmers, then eat seafood at Lo Scalo, where the Adriatic and Ionian seas meet.\n\nSleep There are now so many options in this part of the world, including the Coppola family's divine film-set-like Palazzo Margherita and the gorgeous Masseria Trappan\u00e0, owned by Australian Rob Potter-Sanders. The famed Hotel Piccolo Mondo is old jet-set gem on Puglia\u2019s southern tip that has just been reborn after a renovation. With an outdoor Cinema Paradiso-style movie house, access a private beach and snazzy 1960s-design details, it won't disappoint.\n\nThe 68-page bumper Grand Journeys issue of Sophisticated Traveller is out on Friday, October 18 inside The Australian Financial Review.
