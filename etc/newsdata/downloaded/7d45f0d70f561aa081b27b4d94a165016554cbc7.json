The new ruling read: 'Originality, as we have long recognised, is normally a question of fact.'\n\nThe judges later quoted late Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who said in a ruling back in 1903: 'It would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations, outside of the narrowest and most obvious limits.'\n\nHit track: The singer, 29, released her chart-topping single Shake It Off in 2014 (pictured), which has sold 5.4 million copies as of July 2019\n\nInspiration? Taylor was first sued by songwriters Sean Hall and Nathan Butler in 2017, who claimed her single ripped off 3LW's Playas Gon' Play, which was released in 2001 (pictured)\n\nDetails: A year after the pair filed for copyright against award-winning hitmaker Taylor, judge Michael argued the lyrics were 'too brief, unoriginal and uncreative' (pictured in August)\n\n'Justice Holmes' century-old warning remains valid... Because the absence of originality is not established either on the face of the complaint or through the judicially noticed matters, we reverse the district court's dismissal', the ruling added.\n\nThe case against the Our Song songstress has reportedly been remanded back to a district court for further proceedings.\n\nThe songwriters are said to seek 20% of the profits from the song, which sold 5.4 million copies in the US alone as of July 2019, according to Billboard.\n\nTaylor's defence lawyers previously asked for the case, writing in a statement: 'There can be no copyright protection in \"playas, they gonna play and haters, they gonna hate,\" because it would impermissibly monopolise the idea that players will play and haters will hate.\n\nOngoing: A three-judge panel of Ninth Circuit judges has now ruled Michael's conclusion as premature (pictured in the music video)\n\n'Plaintiffs' claim to being the only ones in the world who can refer to players playing and haters hating is frivolous... Providing a copyright monopoly in the phrase would prevent others from sharing the idea that players play and haters hate.'\n\nThe lawyers went on to argue the concepts were 'public domain cliches' and insisted courts have consistently held that short phrases cannot be copyrighted.\n\nThey also cited other references to 'players' and 'haters' in pop culture, including Fleetwood Mac's 1977 single Dreams and Playa Hater - a 1997 track by Notorious B.I.G.\n\nNext steps: The case against the Our Song songstress has been remanded back to a district court for further proceedings (pictured in August)\n\nA spokesperson for the Gorgeous belter previously slammed the lawsuit as 'ridiculous' and a 'money grab'.\n\nThey told PEOPLE back in September 2017: 'This is a ridiculous claim and nothing more than a money grab. The law is simple and clear. They do not have a case.'\n\nMailOnline has contacted Taylor's representatives for further comment.", "description": "The lawsuit against the 29-year-old singer's 2014 track Shake It Off was reportedly revived by a three-judge panel of Ninth Circuit judges on Monday, 20 months after the case was first dropped.", "authors": ["Rianne Addo For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/10/20319016-0-image-a-33_1572343345997.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
