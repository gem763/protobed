It does have a reputation as being one of the most effective skin-plumping ingredients on the market, after all.\n\nSo here\u2019s everything to know about the holy grail of skincare.\n\nWhat is retinol and what does it do?\n\nSimply put, retinol is an anti-aging molecule that helps with skin renewal \u2013 reducing lines, wrinkles and age spots.\n\nIt\u2019s a derivative from Vitamin A which is used by the body to boost cell turnover and to enhance collagen production. This starts to go downhill at the age of 30.\n\nDr Sarah Shah, founder of the Artistry Clinic on Harley Street and Liverpool Street, tells Metro.co.uk: \u2018Retinol stimulates the production of new blood vessels in the skin, increasing cell turnover and improving uneven skin tones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The dermis layer of the skin contains cells called fibroblasts which produce collagen. These cells start to slow down with ageing and, after the age of 30, our collagen level drops by 1-2% every year.\n\n\u2018Retinol acts directly on these cells to keep them switched on and working to their best ability.\u2019\n\nAfter an individual hits their mid 30s, their cell regeneration starts to slow down.\n\nThis is where retinol helps.\n\nIt stimulates cell renewal by increasing the rate of cell division \u2013 this new cell growth leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there, it can also help with acne, hyper-pigmentation, dryness, rough skin texture, blemishes and more.\n\nWhat\u2019s not to love about that?\n\nHow do you use retinol?\n\nThe Ordinary has a wide range of retinol products (Picture: BeautyBay)\n\nThe number one rule of retinol is to use it at night, after cleansing. This is because Vitamin A derivatives lose their effect in the sunlight.\n\nThey also make skin more sensitive to UVA and UVB, as new cells are prone to burning. So be sure to top up with SPF when incorporating retinol into your skincare routine.\n\nIn terms of when to start using it, most people are motivated to incorporate it when they catch their first glimpses of aging \u2013 be it crow\u2019s feet or laughter lines.\n\nDr Sarah says: \u2018You can also start to use retinol on young skin (from your mid-twenties) as it has further benefits, such as reducing acne and inflammation and controlling the levels of oil production.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are the best retinol products to use?\n\nGoodbye fine lines and wrinkles (Picture: Elizabeth Arden)\n\nResults won\u2019t be apparent instantly but after consistent use for around three months or so, there should be a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that retinol comes in different strengths \u2013 it typically starts at a low 0.1% and goes up to a high 2%. So if you\u2019re starting out, it\u2019s best to opt for a lower concentration and use it sparingly (a pea-sized amount) \u2013 just to see how your skin reacts to it. This is particularly important if you have sensitive skin.\n\nStart by using it approximately two times a week and see how your skin takes to it.\n\nThen use it like a ladder \u2013 if there\u2019s no irritation after using a 0.5% product, slowly but surely go up to a 1%, and so on.\n\nMild irritation, slight dryness and sun sensitivity are normal side effects but flaking, redness, and burning sensations are not normal. Some skin types \u2013 particularly those with eczema and rosacea \u2013 cannot deal with retinol.\n\nIf this is the case, fear not, there are plenty of alternative anti-aging products on the market. Don\u2019t make your skin suffer.\n\nSome products are worth the investment (Picture: SpaceNK)\n\nWhen it comes to buying products, look for the percentage retinol for guidance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ordinary is a great brand to start with. It has a variety of products ranging from 0.2% upwards.\n\nAlternatively, Elizabeth Arden offers biodegradable single-use capsules (each with a shot of retinol) and the brand claims the product is 76% more potent than un-encapsulated retinol.\n\nThe Sunday Riley A+ High-Dose Retinoid Serum does what it says on the tin. It\u2019s a high-strength product, so newbies should steer clear.\n\nMORE: Why we need to stop judging women who wear makeup to the gym\n\nMORE: How to make a homemade face mask from your leftover pumpkin pulp\n\nMORE: What order are you supposed to apply your skincare products?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Retinol is one of the buzzwords of the beauty industry, but what exactly is it and why is it so good for skin?", "authors": ["Lizzie Thomson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/happy-illustration1_1571474690.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
