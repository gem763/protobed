One such investment is the planetary defense-driven test, the Double Asteroid Redirect Test (DART), scheduled to launch in 2021, to demonstrate the possibility of using a kinetic impact to change the motion of an asteroid in space.\u201d\n\nNASA GAMEPLANS MASSIVE ASTEROID STRIKE\n\nThe space agency will launch its first DART mission in 2022. In April, NASA awarded a $69 million contract to SpaceX, the space exploration company led by Elon Musk, to help with DART.\n\nThe next time an asteroid of this magnitude will come that close to Earth is a decade from now. Asteroid 99942 Apophis (named for an Egyptian god of chaos) will come within 19,000 miles of Earth on April 13, 2029, Fox News has previously reported.\n\nAsteroids that come within 0.05 astronomical units and measure more than 460 feet in diameter are known as \"potentially hazardous\" NEOs, according to NASA. They are tracked by the NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS). According to a 2018 report put together by Planetary.org, there are more than 18,000 NEOs.\n\nLast month, Musk said on a podcast that Apophis is not something to worry about, but eventually, a \"big rock\" will hit Earth and as of right now, there's nothing we can do about it.\n\nNASA has been preparing for planetary defense from asteroid strikes for years. A recent survey showed that Americans prefer a space program that focuses on potential asteroid impacts over sending humans back to the Moon or to Mars.\n\nA KILLER ASTEROID IS COMING \u2014 WE DON'T KNOW WHEN (SO LET'S BE READY), BILL NYE SAYS\n\nIn 2016, NASA formalized the agency\u2019s prior program for detecting and tracking NEOs and put it inside its Science Mission Directorate. Last June, NASA unveiled a 20-page plan that detailed the steps the U.S. should take to be better prepared for NEOs \u2013 such as asteroids and comets \u2013 that come within 30 million miles of the planet.\n\nIn addition to enhancing NEO detection, tracking and characterizing capabilities and improving modeling prediction, the plan also aims to develop technologies for deflecting NEOs, increasing international cooperation and establishing new NEO impact emergency procedures and action protocols.\n\nSeparately in April, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said that an asteroid strike is not something to be taken lightly and is perhaps Earth's biggest threat.\n\n\"We have to make sure that people understand that this is not about Hollywood, it's not about movies,\" Bridenstine said at the International Academy of Astronautics' 2019 Planetary Defense Conference in College Park, Md., according to Space.com. \"This is about ultimately protecting the only planet we know right now to host life, and that is the planet Earth.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' Brie Stimson contributed to this report.", "description": "Internal emails from NASA show that the space agency was unaware of asteroid 2019 OK, described as a \"city killer,\" until the last moment on July 24.", "authors": ["Chris Ciaccia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/minimoon-nasa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
