As Trysta Krick details, they do have one saving grace. USA TODAY\n\nMINNEAPOLIS \u2013 You want the Eagles to find someone, anyone for their beleaguered secondary, and for their wide receiver corps that can't seem to get open deep anymore.\n\nIf only it were that simple.\n\nThe Eagles can't magically snap their fingers and get that shutdown cornerback to control opponents like the Vikings' Stefon Diggs, who ran through the Eagles' secondary for 167 yards and 3 touchdowns Sunday.\n\nOr, wham, there's that deep threat at wide receiver who can get open and convert the kind of long passes that Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins, and others, have completed against the Eagles this season.\n\nAnd really, how do you decide what to prioritize, with the trade deadline coming Oct. 29?\n\nAfter all, the problems were widespread in the Eagles' 38-20 loss to the Vikings on Sunday.\n\nMore: 32 things we learned from Week 6 of the 2019 NFL season\n\nWinners, losers: Cowboys at a crossroads while Chiefs searching for answers\n\nIt went much deeper than cornerbacks Rasul Douglas and Sidney Jones, who combined to give up three TDs. Douglas' miscues were more egregious as Diggs beat him for 62 yards and 51 yards, both in the second quarter.\n\nWould Jacksonville's Jalen Ramsey, or someone else, make a difference, when the defensive line couldn't get much pressure on Cousins? Or when Douglas didn't get any needed safety help, a coverage Malcolm Jenkins said he blew on Diggs\u2019 second TD.\n\nThen here\u2019s Fletcher Cox, a Pro Bowl defensive tackle the past four seasons. He has played six games and has zero sacks.\n\nWould a trade help the Eagles as soon as next Sunday, when they have a first-place showdown \u2013 such as it is with two 3-3 teams \u2013 in Dallas?\n\nPerhaps the Eagles are stuck for now with what they have at cornerback. That means Douglas and Jones have to put this debacle behind them, and quickly.\n\n\"It\u2019s not hard at all,\" Douglas said about moving on. \"You watch film ... Once we go over the mistakes, then what can you do to get better? Just practice. At the end of the day, you\u2019ve got a game next week. You gotta forget about this one. It\u2019s already over \u2026 We got the Cowboys, a divisional team. Just looking forward to that.\"\n\nAt this rate, so are the Cowboys, for obvious reasons. They have Amari Cooper and Michael Gallup at wide receiver.\n\nIt\u2019s not going to get better soon.\n\nRonald Darby (hamstring) and Avonte Maddox (concussion, neck) have missed three and two games, respectively. Jalen Mills (foot) is hoping to get cleared to come off the physically unable to perform list this week, and possibly return against the Cowboys.\n\nBut Mills last played in a game Oct. 28, 2018, or 50 weeks ago.\n\nIt's the same at wide receiver.\n\nDeSean Jackson played in one full game this season before suffering an abdominal injury. The Eagles, other than running back Miles Sanders, haven't been able to complete long passes since.\n\nSanders, for the fourth game in a row, had the longest reception of the game, with a 45-yard reception after scoring on a 32-yard touchdown.\n\nJackson had two TD receptions, each for 50-plus yards, in the season opener. The Eagles haven't had another completion that long since.\n\nWould someone like Cincinnati's A.J. Green change that, at least right away?\n\nMaybe, maybe not. Besides, he\u2019s hurt. And so is Ramsey.\n\nLast year, the Eagles traded for Golden Tate at the deadline, and he wasn't very effective.\n\n\"We had some opportunity to get down the field,\" Eagles coach Doug Pederson said. \"We stretched the field a little bit a few times. We got creative with it, with moving some guys around. Obviously, DeSean helps that when he's out there. But that's something we've got to continue to work with and work through and find ways to be creative that way.\"\n\nSo the Eagles will keep looking for that creativity, while hoping that Jackson can return, if not against the Cowboys, then shortly after.\n\nThe Eagles might not have much of a choice.\n\nEagles general manager Howie Roseman could give up multiple draft picks, including first-rounders, to address the issues at cornerback and wide receiver. Or he could prioritize one spot over the other and hope the one he doesn't address works itself out.\n\nOr he could hope the Eagles adjust, get their injured players back at some point, and go on a run down the stretch of the season and get into the playoffs like they did last season.\n\nThat might not be the answer that fans are hoping for.\n\n\"There were some shots that we didn't connect on,\" Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz said. \"There were some other things where I might have missed some guys and those types of things. But it's a good defense, and we really had to earn it today.\"\n\nThe Eagles didn't come close, all around.\n\nJones and Douglas couldn\u2019t guard. The defensive line, one week after getting 10 sacks against the Jets, had just one on Cousins.\n\nAnd wide receivers Nelson Agholor and Alshon Jeffery combined to average 7.7 yards per catch. Sanders, with 219 receiving yards this season, has four more yards than Jeffery does.\n\nThat's hardly going to move the chains, let alone tax an opposing secondary.\n\nPerhaps Sanders put it best when asked what it's like being the Eagles' deep threat as a running back:\n\n\"Obviously, I\u2019m going to do whatever it takes to help this team win,\" he said. \"So whether it\u2019s me running routes out of the backfield or keeping defenses on their toes, they\u2019re worried about me.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s pretty much the only one.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.
