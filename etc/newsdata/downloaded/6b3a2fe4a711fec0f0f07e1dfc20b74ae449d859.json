The type of \"transcript\" released today is a collection of sentences and paragraphs SUMMARIZING what was said during the conversation, summaries made by others in the room or listening in. It is not word-for-word but more content-by-content. Look upon these types of \"transcripts\" as things people can go to Presidential Libraries and The Library of Congress for in the future and read to perform research: Example, \"When did President Trump speak with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and what did they talk about?\" That's it - that's all these \"transcripts\" are good for. The second type of transcript is the actual TRANSCRIPT, word-for-word. These are kept for national security reasons and are for the CIA, DOD, State, and other Intelligence Agencies. The point is: ALL ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE DONE THIS GOING BACK TO TRUMAN. The ONLY way to find out what was really said is if a Congressional Committee, essentially, subpoenas the DOJ to release the actual transcript to a select group of Senators and Representatives - that's the ONLY WAY to really find out what was actually said.\"..........Unless you've been in this environment and you know how all this operates, anything you say or post is based completely what you hear or read from other people...", "description": "The 71st Emmy Awards was a spectacular affair for the Brits, while broadcast networks all but vanished.
