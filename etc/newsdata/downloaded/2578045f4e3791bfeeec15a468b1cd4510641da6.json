The No. 2 overall pick celebrated by planting an invisible flag into the field.\n\nBosa was a member of Ohio State when Mayfield savored a 31-16 win over the Buckeyes in September 2017. The Oklahoma star ran to midfield after the game and pretended to stick a Sooners flag into the turf.\n\nThat's the problem with trash talk and being a little petty in victory. Sometimes it comes back around on you.\n\nBosa had clearly been planning his vengeance for a long time.", "description": "He who laughs last, laughs best.
