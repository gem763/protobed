I guess there wasn\u2019t that much to say,\u201d right fielder Josh Reddick said.\n\nGreinke kept his cool after a rocky start Thursday night and the Astros romped to an 8-3 victory over the New York Yankees for a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven AL Championship Series.\n\nA report by NJ Advance Media detailed some of the jeering directed at Greinke as he got loose before the game. Fans in the left field bleachers insulted his family and taunted the Astros starting pitcher with chants about his social anxiety disorder. At least one was ejected as police officers kept a watchful eye close by, the outlet noted.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything,\u201d Greinke said softly in the Houston clubhouse after allowing one run in 4 1/3 innings.\n\nThe revved-up Bronx crowd also chanted \u201cDonald! Donald!\u201d \u2014 which is Greinke\u2019s given first name \u2014 while he was in the bullpen and on the mound.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if low class is the right word, but they are hectic,\u201d Reddick said. \u201cI think winning three straight at their home park is going to make a bigger statement than that.\u201d\n\nGreinke walked four \u2014 three in the first inning for the first time since April 2007 \u2014 and quickly fell behind 1-0. But the 35-year-old right-hander pitched out of an early bases-loaded jam and then settled in. He retired nine in a row before DJ LeMahieu\u2019s one-out single in the fifth.\n\nBefore the game, Astros manager AJ Hinch said he would take his team off the field if fans again threw objects at Houston players.\n\nReddick said Yankee Stadium fans tossed water bottles, baseballs and other objects in his direction during Game 3 on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI will pull the team off the field if we get in that situation again where bottles are being thrown and balls are being thrown and it becomes unruly,\u201d Hinch said prior to Game 4. \u201cThere\u2019s other ways to support your home team, and this place does as good a job as anybody trying to police that while also trying to create an environment that\u2019s all pro-Yankees. It would be a very ugly scene for baseball, a very ugly scene for the Yankees, if one of our guys was hit by something from the upper deck. Something tragic could happen and nobody wants that.\u201d\n\nA warning message was shown on the large center-field video board before the game: \u201cPlease be advised that it is illegal to throw any substance or object in the stadium. Violators face ejection and a permanent ban from Yankee Stadium, as well as criminal and civil penalties.\u201d\n\nAn audio recording from Yankees manager Aaron Boone imploring fans to \u201cplease don\u2019t throw objects onto the field\u201d was played after the second inning.\n\nReddick said Yankee Stadium fans \u201cfind anything they can on you\u201d to jeer but described those in the outfield Thursday as \u201cpretty laid back, actually.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get anything thrown at me tonight, so that was nice,\u201d he said with a smile.\n\n\u201cTo come in here and take the first two from a team like this in their home park, this is one of the hardest places to play on the road. The atmosphere is very intense and very unique, so it makes a big statement when we come in here and do that,\u201d Reddick added.\n\nHouston third baseman Alex Bregman said he loves the \u201cawesome\u201d atmosphere. He said playing at Yankee Stadium in October is like being in the middle of a boxing match with \u201cmadness all around you.\u201d\n\nBut he said it\u2019s the same back home at Minute Maid Park during the postseason.\n\nYankees fans cheered when Houston leadoff man George Springer, who hit a three-run homer earlier, was brushed back by reliever Tommy Kahnle in the seventh, and again when Robinson Chirinos was hit by a 91 mph cutter from CC Sabathia in the eighth.\n\nWith the seats mostly empty as the Astros tacked on runs in the last two innings against the sloppy Yankees, one fan yelled \u201cwake up!\u201d A Bronx cheer went up when shortstop Didi Gregorius gloved an easy popup in the ninth.\n\nNew York fans tossed some trash and debris onto the field Tuesday after a replay review changed Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n\u2019s infield hit leading off the eighth to a groundout. Houston went on to win 4-1.\n\n\u201cI went out on the field the other day, I wanted the umpires to know that it was becoming a dangerous situation,\u201d Hinch said Thursday. \u201cOur guys have reported both in the bullpen and in the outfield, you could see the stuff thrown on the field. There\u2019s no place for that. Both teams will agree. And it\u2019s really hard to stop fans from doing that. But it\u2019s also very dangerous. MLB is aware. We\u2019re aware.\u201d\n\nReddick homered in the second inning of Game 3 for a 2-0 lead. Fans directed insults at him when he went to right.\n\n\u201cYou throw a baseball hard enough and hit somebody in the head when they\u2019re not looking, it could do some damage to the player, so it\u2019s definitely disrespectful and at the same time very unsafe,\u201d Reddick said after the game.\n\nHe also said he was subject to verbal abuse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of all kinds of different things here, but you\u2019re used to that for nine innings. Pretty standard,\u201d Reddick said. \u201cThey\u2019re all yelling at the same time, so it all kind of mumbles together.\u201d\n\nReddick said Thursday night that he spoke with Major League Baseball security about the situation.\n\n\u201cThey said they were going to up the security and the police presence in the outfield and the bullpen,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really get a good look at it, but the people that I did talk to I had very credible conversations with and I do feel they did all the right necessary moves to take care of things. And we obviously didn\u2019t see anything thrown on the field tonight, so that\u2019s obviously a positive sign.\u201d", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sounds as though Zack Greinke got an earful at Yankee Stadium while warming up in the bullpen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Matt-Slocum1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
