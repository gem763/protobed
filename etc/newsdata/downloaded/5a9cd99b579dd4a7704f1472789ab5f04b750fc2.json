Here are all the health risks you should know about.", "language": "en", "text": "AP Photo/Craig Mitchelldyer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration are investigating a spate of lung illnesses tied to vaping, or using e-cigarettes.\n\nAccording to new numbers released on Oct. 10, there have been 1,299 confirmed and probable cases of illness across the US. 26 people have died.\n\nInvestigators still don't know the cause, but they're increasingly narrowing in on cannabis, which was involved in three-quarters of the cases.\n\nThe mysterious lung disease isn't the only risk of vaping. Read on to see how vaping affects your health.\n\nStill, when compared against smoking, vaping nicotine appears to be healthier.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nSince June, 1,299 people in the US have been struck with lung illnesses tied to vaping, or using e-cigarettes. Twenty-six people have died.\n\nThe new figures, released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Oct. 10, include confirmed and probable lung-illness cases from 49 states, Washington, DC, and the US Virgin Islands. US officials have said they expect the number of deaths tied to vaping to increase.\n\nVaping is a highly variable hobby, making it difficult for officials to determine exactly what's causing the illnesses and deaths.\n\nInvestigators have not yet identified a single common brand, device type, or drug across the cases. That could mean that all of the illnesses were triggered by the same issue, or that some of the cases are different diseases with some similar symptoms.\n\nOfficials said that it's likely that products containing THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, played a role in the outbreak. About three quarters of the people who have the lung disease reported using vapes containing THC. About 13% said they exclusively vaped nicotine.\n\nThe CDC and the Food and Drug Administration are working together to figure out the potential causes. The agencies have previously said they've gathered about 120 vaping devices and substances that may be linked to the illnesses, and are currently studying them.\n\nSome reports have suggested that vitamin E acetate, which has been found in some of the products, may play a role in the illnesses.\n\nRead more: Vaping is leading to a spate of lung injuries, comas, and death. Lung experts say oils like vitamin E may be partially to blame.\n\nThe CDC advised people to consider not vaping until it can figure out the cause of the illnesses. The agency also warned smokers who vape nicotine to not return to smoking, however.\n\nSo far, the available evidence still suggests that when compared to smoking, vaping is a healthier habit. The practice involves inhaling heated vapor, rather than burned material. In general, vapers are believed to be exposed to fewer toxicants and cancer-causing substances than smokers.\n\nTo help prevent young people from vaping, states including Michigan, New York, and Massachusetts have banned at least some e-cigarette products.\n\nThere are hundreds of different kinds of vaping devices\n\nThere's an enormous amount of variety when it comes to vaping devices, ingredients, and brands \u2014 making it difficult to pinpoint any single cause.\n\nFirst, there are the all-in-one style devices, where all of the necessary pieces are contained in the device itself. These popular e-cigs are sold under brand names like Juul and Blu (for nicotine), and Pax (for cannabis).\n\nRead more: The precarious path of e-cig startup Juul: From Silicon Valley darling to $38 billion behemoth under criminal investigation\n\nThen there are the modifiable tank-based e-cigs, in which pieces of the device can be bought separately, and users can customize everything from the temperature of the device to the drug ingredients. These modifiable setups have been linked with dangers in the past, including at least two deaths.\n\nFinally, there are the ingredients that go into the devices, which can range from waxes to liquids to ground plant matter. Some devices allow users to pour in their own liquid or stuff in their own wax or herbs, while other devices simply include disposable pre-filled cartridges.\n\nIn some of the cases reported to health agencies, users said they were vaping cannabis when their illness occurred. In Oregon, health officials said they had received reports that the person who died had been vaping cannabis. But because marijuana is still illegal in many states, it's possible that those cases are under-reported. Other vapers in the reports have been using only nicotine.\n\nIn many of the cases, patients said they experienced a gradual start of symptoms like trouble breathing, shortness of breath, and chest pain before they were brought to the hospital. Some people said they also experienced stomach issues including vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nA new practice with several unknowns\n\nVaping is a relatively new practice, having only became popular within the past decade. Because of its novelty, researchers have warned that there's a lot we still don't know about how the practice impacts the brain and body.", "description": "Investigators don't know the cause and haven't identified a single common brand or drug across all of the cases.
