This is a day as a gruelling as the Queen's Coronation twenty-five years ago.\"\n\n(Image: NETFLIX)\n\nMany noted that while the Jubilee was twenty-five years after the Queen ascended to the throne on the death of her father, it was actually 24 years since the Coronation, which was held after some delay in 1953.\n\nHowever, the blunder that fans spotted is actually, in and of itself, historically accurate.\n\nThe error was made live on air on the morning of the Jubilee by BBC presenter Andy Price, with the producers of The Crown showing their eye for detail by keeping the mistake in.\n\nSo, we can marvel at the show's period detail once more!\n\nThe Crown season 3 is released on Netflix on November 17, 2019.\n\nAre you excited for the return of The Crown?
