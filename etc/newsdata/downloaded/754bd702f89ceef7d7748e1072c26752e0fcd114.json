Which gives me a hook to play with a concept you might call \u201cminoritarian populism.\u201d\n\nTrump regularly describes the impeachment inquiry as a \u201ccoup,\u201d and the White House Counsel\u2019s Office has adopted the official legal stance that it\u2019s \u201cillegitimate.\u201d This is supposed to justify the maximal abuse of presidential prerogative and the blanket defiance of lawful subpoenas to shut down that inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nTrump and Republicans \u2014 along with Trump\u2019s media propagandists \u2014 have fused this attack on the legitimacy of impeachment and oversight with attacks on the \u201cdeep state.\u201d The argument is that the impeachment inquiry, and revelations coming from the whistleblower and other alarmed career public servants, together amount to a concerted effort to overturn the last election.\n\nAD\n\nBouie debunks this narrative by pointing out that impeachment is part of the constitutional order and doesn\u2019t actually nullify elections. And he also challenges the idea that Trump represents the people\u2019s will, noting that he is the legitimate president under our system but not one who represents the will of the majority (as Trump implicitly claims).\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that he represents the people, Bouie notes, draws on a certain type of \u201cright-wing populist logic.\u201d The \u201cpeople\u201d are constituted only by his supporters, and the elected political opposition and government professionals who harbor reservations or deep and sincere panic about Trump can be dismissed as part of a corrupt elite that is trying to defy that popular will:\n\nAD\n\nHe casts himself as a representative of \u201cthe people,\u201d narrowly defined as his supporters, who are themselves \u2014 in a sort of circular logic \u2014 the essence of the nation. In the Trumpist vision, the 2016 election stands apart from all others. It\u2019s no longer a grant of constitutionally-bounded authority. It becomes a kind of coronation, in which Trump is sanctified as the embodiment of a \u201creal America,\u201d the actual size of which is irrelevant. Under this logic, the pro-Trump case against impeachment is straightforward. Democrats, hostile Republicans (\u201chuman scum\u201d) and dissenting bureaucrats are illegitimized by the fact of their opposition, whenever it started and whatever the reason. That opposition, in turn, is a repudiation of \u201cthe people\u201d of Trump\u2019s imagination, which is how the use of a legitimate, constitutional process becomes an attempt to \u201coverturn\u201d their will.\n\nA few points. First, there is a legitimate debate to be had over how far government insiders and intelligence operatives should go in challenging the president, since he\u2019s elected and they are not.\n\nAD\n\nBut in the present context, this debate has mostly been settled already \u2014 against Trump. The whole legal scaffolding of whistleblower protections that arose in legislative stages after Watergate reflects the recognition that you want government insiders to be able to sound the alarm about wrongdoing without fear of retaliation from agency heads who serve at the executive\u2019s pleasure. You want this to protect the people.\n\nThe rigorous process by which this latest whistleblower had his claims vetted for credibility \u2014 and transmitted to Congress \u2014 reflects such innovations in good governing. True, it does create complications when the wrongdoer is the president. But the bottom line is that when Trump attacks this as a sham process \u2014 as an effort to flout some fictitious people\u2019s will \u2014 he\u2019s actually trying to undermine the very sort of protections that evolved to deal with precisely the sort of corruption Trump is engaged in. These processes were created and built upon by democratically elected Congresses and previous presidents.\n\nAD\n\nAnd, of course, the current Democratic House majority was also elected (in the largest midterm national popular vote win since, ironically enough, Watergate). The chambers set their own rules under the Constitution, so the Democratic impeachment process that Trump attacks for flouting his people\u2019s will actually does reflect the will of that 2018 popular majority in the sense that it\u2019s being implemented by their elected representatives.\n\nAD\n\nWhat makes all of this so galling is not just that Trump lost the 2016 popular vote, but also that he constantly legitimizes minoritarian tactics and even openly declares that electoral outcomes are not legitimate if he doesn\u2019t win.\n\nPopulism is sometimes said to be in tension with liberalism\u2019s commitments to limited government and technocratic expertise, in that institutional constraints on popular government and the bureaucracy of experts do sometimes thwart majoritarianism. This creates genuine and thorny problems best left to the political theory eggheads.\n\nAD\n\nBut in this case, what Trump represents isn\u2019t even majoritarianism.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cpopulism\u201d \u2014 which holds that the only \u201cpeople\u201d who count are his own, and which can be invoked as a weapon against opposition leaders and legitimate processes ensuring accountability in government alike \u2014 has in a sense fused with a much longer-running Republican addiction to counter-majoritarian tactics. (It\u2019s interesting that Trumpist populism and GOP minority-rule tactics both constitute a response to perceived slow-rolling demographic emergencies, but in somewhat different ways.) Those tactics include extreme partisan gerrymandering, voter suppression and census-gaming (the latter two of which Trump has endorsed with gusto) and norm-shredding such as the holding up of a Supreme Court seat (which Trump got to fill).\n\nAD\n\nOf course, in the minoritarian populist worldview, if the opposition is illegitimate, then any and all tactics employed against it can be reverse-justified as a reassertion of that fictitious \u201cpeople\u2019s will\u201d arrayed behind the populist leader, even if that opposition actually does in some sense represent a majority.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "What it means when Trump denounces impeachment as a 'coup.'", "authors": ["Greg Sargent", "Opinion Writer Covering National Politics", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/owy3yBpLKq1nxGzi2HM6h-rxBnw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B66CONXWSAI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
