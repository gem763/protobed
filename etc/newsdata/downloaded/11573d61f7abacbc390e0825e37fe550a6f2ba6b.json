Over time support for more altcoins will be added as collateral and loan options to maximize availability of the service among the entire crypto industry. Loans will be provided at low interest rates and with high loan-to-value ratios.\n\n\u201cBitrue\u2019s goal from the beginning was always to bridge the emerging crypto markets with the traditional financial services sector\u201d said Curis Wang, CEO of Bitrue. \u201cNow that the Bitrue exchange has gained a loyal user base and trust within the industry, it\u2019s a perfect time for us to launch the first of our initiatives. We find this particularly exciting as it\u2019s an opportunity to provide access to financial services to all people, regardless of whether they\u2019re rich or poor or where they\u2019re located in the world.\u201d\n\nRevenue generated from the loans will be used to support the existing Power Piggy function, the wildly popular feature which provides users with a risk free method of generating up to 10.3% yearly interest on the coins they invest. Bitrue Loans will be offered at a daily basic interest rate of 0.04% with no limit to the repayment period of the collateral. As the platform continues to develop and enter phase 2 of its lifecycle, users will be able to enjoy reduced repayment rates if they possess sufficient amounts of the platform token Bitrue Coin (BTR), and also access a variety of digital asset management and DeFi services coming soon.\n\nAbout Bitrue\n\nBitrue is a growing cryptocurrency exchange and digital asset management service that is disrupting the industry by adapting traditional financial services to the newly emerging crypto markets.
