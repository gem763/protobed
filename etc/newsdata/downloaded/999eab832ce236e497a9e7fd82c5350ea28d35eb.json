Rashida Tlaib told Detroit\u2019s chief of police that he should hire only black people as analysts to run their facial recognition software because, she claimed, non-black people think they all look alike.\n\nThe suggestion came Monday as Chief James Craig gave Tlaib a tour of the Real Time Crime Center, where the department uses facial recognition technology to find suspects. Craig was showing Tlaib how the software works, and how analysts use it to identify and locate individuals. But the tour quickly turned contentious as the freshman Michigan congresswoman made repeated requests that were shot down by the chief.\n\nTLAIB HAS PROMOTED FOUR VIRAL RACIAL HOAXES IN 2019\n\n\u201cAnalysts need to be African-Americans, not people that are not,\u201d Tlaib said. \u201cIt\u2019s true, I think non-African-Americans think African-Americans all look the same!\u201d She said she has witnessed people confuse Reps. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who both are black and bald.\n\nCraig, who is black, did not go for Tlaib\u2019s suggestion.\n\n\u201cI trust people who are trained, regardless of race, regardless of gender,\u201d he responded.\n\nThis came after Tlaib claimed that \u201cthe error rate among African-Americans, especially women,\u201d was 60 percent.\n\n\u201cI understand the technology real well,\u201d Craig said. He showed Tlaib how his analysts examine the software\u2019s results before making determinations.\n\n\u201cSee if you can get some of our money back until they fix it,\u201d Tlaib said, to which Craig simply replied, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if defendants were prosecuted solely based on facial recognition results, Craig said they were not.\n\nThe tour, which was recorded and then posted by a reporter with The Detroit News, got off to a rocky start when Tlaib asked the reporter, \u201cAre you facial recognizing me right now? I\u2019m sorry who are you and why are you videotaping me?\u201d\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO:\n\nRASHIDA TLAIB'S CAMPAIGN SELLING 'IMPEACH THE MF' T-SHIRTS\n\nAfterward, the Detroit News reporter followed up on Tlaib\u2019s assertion that only black people should be hired to use the facial recognition software.\n\n\u201cAre you saying white people are not qualified to --,\u201d he said, before Tlaib cut him off.\n\n\u201cNo, I think there\u2019s actually been studies out that it\u2019s hard for, you know, like African-Americans would identify African-Americans, similar, Latino same thing,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen asked if that would mean African-Americans should not be allowed to identify white people, Tlaib said, \u201cLook it up,\u201d and walked away.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Detroit Police Department extended the invitation to Tlaib in August, after she described facial recognition technology as \u201cbulls---.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nCraig made headlines in 2015 after he said more citizens should be armed. While in the past he supported increased restrictions on weapons and ammunition, his position changed after visiting Maine and Los Angeles, where permits for carrying concealed weapons are easier to acquire.\n\n\u201cI changed my orientation real quick,\u201d Craig said. \u201cMaine is one of the safest places in America. Clearly, suspects knew that good Americans were armed.\u201d", "description": "Democratic Rep.
