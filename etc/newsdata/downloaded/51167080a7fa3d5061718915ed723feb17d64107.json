Is that it? Now I\u2019m not interested in made-up circuits, and I really have an active dislike of claiming a reverse circuit is a different configuration. No, it isn\u2019t. Some circuits (Silverstone for example) do have multiple configurations, but reverse is not one of them!\n\nCompared to Project CARS 2\u2019s 40+ only having 13 circuits is sparse. And missing the mighty Spa, the ultrafast Monza, and the fan favourite Nordschleife are kind of deal breakers for me.\n\nSecondly, the review says it has the best handling of this generation. The review mentions both Forza and Gran Turismo, but I want to know how it handles compared to Project CARS 2 or Asseto Corsa? Is it a sim or a sim-cade? And the weather, how does it compare to Project CARS 2\u2019s dynamic weather system?\n\nWill the review be updated once multiplayer is up and running? I\u2019m a huge fan of multiplayer in racing so it would be good to know how this works. What are the lobbies like? Is the community respectful and fair, or will they ram you off the road given half a chance? Do you need to unlock cars in single-player or are they available from the off? This is important because I probably wouldn\u2019t touch the single-player mode a lot.\n\nOne thing I am pleased about is no modding! If I\u2019m racing, I want cars in the same class to be just that. Modding is very different to adjustable set-ups.\n\nI guess my real question is, is it better than Project CARS 2, as this is my go-to online racer. Based on the review I\u2019m not sure it is.\n\nThanks for your work guys! Always my go-to for video games.\n\nKeep up the good work.\n\nTheDudeAbides\n\nGC: Thanks. Codemasters is implying that there will be more circuits to come, but it\u2019s probably always going to be on the low side. In our opinion it does have the best handling but obviously Project CARS 2 is good as well, so it\u2019s all going to be a little subjective at that level. If you like racing games as much as it sounds like you do we can\u2019t imagine you wouldn\u2019t like GRID.", "description": "The Wednesday Inbox is upset it\u2019s never found a Nintendo PlayStation in a box of junk, as readers stick up for Super Mario Run.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jqgsycanfavvbig_1570572910.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
