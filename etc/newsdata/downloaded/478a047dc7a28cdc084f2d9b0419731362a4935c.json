In New Zealand, there was some complacency: do or die; sure, but who could challenge the world\u2019s greatest rugby team?\n\nEngland, apparently.\n\nAt the Bullock Bar in Wanaka, a small farming and tourist town in the alps of the South Island, the mood was sombre at half time, and turned black as the end approached. Not good enough, not fast enough, not World Cup winners.\n\nOutside a storm blew in, the wind sharp and jarring, as World Cup glory stormed out of reach.\n\nGareth Lewis, 44, short, stocky, a lifelong fan, wore his All Blacks jersey skin tight. At the conclusion of the match, as the Bullock Bar emptied quietly and in record-time, his eyes were moist, his expression stunned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty despondent. But England deserved to win. They outplayed us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like our religion here. We\u2019re not a country of faith strongly, rugby is what brings us all together, you know? It\u2019s like the glue that keeps New Zealand together. When we lose it\u2019s tough, it\u2019s hard work.\u201d\n\nLewis said it would take him a few days \u2013 at least \u2013 to recover from the shock defeat.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be a long old night. But we\u2019ll have a laugh tomorrow. Like George Gregan said \u2013 four more years, you know, we can have another crack.\u201d\n\nOtago University sports psychologist Steve Jackson said while many Kiwis would be experiencing genuine feelings of sadness about the loss, 2019 had been a trying year already, and the nation was well equipped to swiftly move on.\n\n\u201cKiwis will be disappointed but those who know rugby will accept they were beaten by a better team,\u201d Jackson said.\n\n\u201cThe depth of pain will depend on how much individuals care. The media will claim national disaster but New Zealand has faced earthquakes and terror attacks [recently]. Life will go on.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve got Brexit right? They\u2019ve got that Boris guy in charge? Damn. Maybe they need this Dave Reed, fan\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s sport and recreation minister, Grant Robertson, was in Yokohama for the game. A lifelong All Blacks fan, he tweeted gracious defeat.\n\n\u201cThe better team won on the night. England accurate in every facet of game. Our lads didn\u2019t fire. ABs still have a lot to be proud of but just not to be #allblacks.\u201d\n\nIn Wanaka, as Kiwis put down their drinks and headed to the 24/7 grocery store for pies and small buckets of chips, sadness was matched by pragmatism, following the lead of All Blacks coach Steve Hanson, who praised England\u2019s \u201ctremendous\u201d game.\n\n\u201cTonight we just weren\u2019t good enough,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got to take that on the chin \u2013 as does everybody back home.\u201d\n\nDave Reed, 60, of Canterbury, quietly nursed a beer at the bar, staring dumbstruck at the screen as England celebrated \u2013 demurely, politely \u2013 at Yokohama stadium.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been better,\u201d said Reed, smiling, following Hansen\u2019s lead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very sad, I\u2019m pretty gutted. But England deserved to win. I\u2019m an All Black through and through but they deserved to win. Definitely. The All Blacks didn\u2019t turn up today. They didn\u2019t let us play. We never got to play today, did we?\u201d\n\nLike many at the bar, Reed wondered if England needed this win now more than New Zealand. \u201cI mean, they\u2019ve got Brexit right? They\u2019ve got that Boris guy in charge? Damn. Maybe they need this, who wouldn\u2019t need this with what they\u2019ve got going on up there? We\u2019ll be ok.\u201d", "description": "Supporters in southern town of Wanaka say it will take time to recover but \u2018life will go on\u2019", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82ae70ef58abe3dd35a81a4207665479d459e882/0_232_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=473f17c3fd6f55950b25915ab512ba9a", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
