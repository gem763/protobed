No buyer has been announced.\n\nAmid rising debts, the airport has reportedly slashed its charges to try to retain business.", "description": "The order follows revelations some crews had stayed at one of the president's Scottish golf resorts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/77B5/production/_108654603_5ebd38e3-fd4d-4489-bd81-ccbf71cf8bc8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
