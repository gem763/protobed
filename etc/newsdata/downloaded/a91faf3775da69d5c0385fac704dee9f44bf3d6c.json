The Fed has cut rates two times in successive meetings. Only 7 of 17 Fed officials have called for another rate cut this year, according to projections released by the Fed last month.\n\nBut earlier this week, soft readings from widely-followed business sentiment surveys of manufacturers and the service sector spooked investors and raised recession fears.\n\nAfter sharp selloffs, stocks recovered some ground later in the week, with gains accelerating after the jobs report was released.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.42% was up 372 points on Friday, but was still down by almost 250 points for the week.", "description": "Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Friday she was pleased with the \u2018pretty solid\u2019 September employment report.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS594_mester_ZG_20191003122358.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
