Elizabeth Warren, particularly her position on Medicare for All, as she\u2019s continued to rise in national and state-wide polls.\n\nButtigieg used the debate over Medicare for All to spar with Warren. While Warren supports Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan, Buttigieg supports Medicare for All Who Want It \u2014 which would allow Americans to keep existing private insurance plans. Buttigieg pounced on Warren for evading a yes-or-no question about whether taxes would go up on middle-class families due to her plan: \u201cYou heard it tonight: a yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nBreaking with this year\u2019s tradition of starting debate by arguing over the nuances of the candidates\u2019 health-care plans, the moderators began by asking the 12 contenders about the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump \u2014 which followed a whistleblower complaint alleging the President used his office to \u201csolicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d\n\nIn line with recent public opinion polls that show the majority of Americans support the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, every candidate that had an opportunity to answer expressed similar views on the subject. Trump is \u201cthe most corrupt\u201d president ever, said Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \u201cThe President has left the Congress with no choice,\u201d said South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg. \u201cI want to remind everybody that every candidate here is more decent, more coherent and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House,\u201d said businessman Tom Steyer, who graced the debate stage for the first time Tuesday.\n\nIn the early moments of the debate, candidates also debated federal job guarantees. \u201cDamn right, we will,\u201d Sanders said to a question about whether he would be able to ensure every American who wanted a job could have one. Yang criticized Sanders\u2019 plan, arguing that it would not take into account people like his wife, a stay-at-home mother.\n\nUnlike September\u2019s debate, some candidates also brought up reproductive rights, in light of new legislation in several states aiming to limit or restrict access to abortion. \u201cThere are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive health care,\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris said. \u201cAnd it is not an exaggeration to say women will die. Poor women, women of color will die because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with their bodies.\u201d\n\nSen. Cory Booker praised Harris\u2019 comment: \u201cGod bless Kamala. But you know what? Women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight,\u201d Booker said. \u201cIt is not just because women are our voters and our friends and our wives. It\u2019s because women are people and people deserve to control their own body.\u201d\n\nAll 10 candidates who appeared in the September debate were onstage with two additions: Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and billionaire executive Tom Steyer, who made his Democratic National Committee-sanctioned presidential primary debate debut.\n\nThe debate was co-hosted by CNN and The New York Times and aired live at 8 p.m. from Otterbein University.

Four women were on stage, the highest number to ever share a presidential primary debate stage. The record was previously held by the past three 2020 Democratic presidential primary debates, which included three women on stage each night. Before the 2020 cycle, no presidential debate stage had included more than one woman.\n\nCandidates needed to have at least 2% in four DNC-approved polls and receive at least 130,000 unique donations by Oct. 1 to qualify for the debate. The candidates are standing on stage based on the average of the 10 most recent qualifying polls as of Oct. 2. This puts Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg closest to the middle.\n\nPodium order announced for the CNN/New York Times Democratic presidential debate https://t.co/R41KgORK1V pic.twitter.com/gLiJOiUofY \u2014 Vaughn Sterling (@vplus) October 2, 2019\n\nHere are highlights from the October Democratic primary debate:\n\nWarren plays defense on Medicare for All\n\nWhen the debate turned to health care, the knives came out for Elizabeth Warren. The moderators began by asking Warren how she would pay for Medicare for All and whether she would raise taxes as part of it. As she has in previous debates, the Massachusetts Senator focused on the results of her plan rather than getting into specifics.\n\n\u201cI will not sign a bill into law that will not lower costs for middle-class families,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar pushed back, accusing Warren of being evasive. Buttigieg said viewers were seeing \u201ca yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer\u201d and touted his own \u201cMedicare for All who want it\u201d plan that would offer a public option that people could choose to buy into.\n\nKlobuchar, meanwhile, called Warren\u2019s plan a \u201cpipe dream\u201d and said that by talking about Medicare for All, she was creating \u201cRepublican talking points.\u201d Bernie Sanders jumped in to back up Warren on the details of Medicare for All and highlight the issues with the country\u2019s current health-care system. Warren defended herself too, calling Buttigieg\u2019s plan \u201cMedicare for all who can afford it\u201d and stuck by her argument that overall costs would go down for middle-class families.\n\nBiden addresses son Hunter\u2019s Ukraine business interests\n\nModerator Anderson Cooper brought up President Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated accusations that Biden\u2019s son Hunter broke laws while serving on a company board in Ukraine. Although there\u2019s no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son, Cooper pointed out that Biden has since said that if he becomes President, none of his family members would be involved in foreign businesses.\n\nCooper asked Biden that if he says it would be inappropriate for his family members to be involved in foreign businesses if he\u2019s President, why was it okay for his son to be involved in foreign businesses while he was Vice President?\n\n\u201cMy son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the U.S. government, rooting out corruption in Ukraine,\u201d Biden responded. Biden then evoked President George Washington, who is believed to have said a major threat to American democracy would be foreign interference. Biden said that Trump has encouraged foreign interference three times.\n\n\u201cRudy Giuliani, the President, and his thugs have already proved that they in fact are flat lying,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe\u2019s going after me because he knows if I get the nomination I will beat him like a drum.\u201d\n\nCooper then followed up, citing a recent ABC News interview in which Hunter Biden said he made a mistake by becoming involved with foreign business dealings while his father was Vice President. Cooper asked the former Vice President if felt he had also made a mistake. \u201cI did my job, I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always kept everything separate.\u201c\n\nCandidates express support for impeachment in debate\u2019s first question\n\nImpeachment took center stage as soon as the debate kicked off, marking a turn away from prior Democratic primary debates, which began with questions about health care. Each candidate expressed support for impeachment, starting with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who got the first question on why she thinks Congress should take on the issue rather than leaving the choice to voters in the next election.\n\n\u201cBecause sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that\u2019s the case with this impeachment inquiry,\u201d Warren answered.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders also reiterated his support for impeaching Trump, calling him a \u201ccorrupt\u201d President and saying Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should \u201cdo the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.\u201d Former Vice President Joe Biden also called Trump \u201ccorrupt\u201d and said Democrats \u201chave no choice but to move\u201d on impeachment.\n\n(L-R) Former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, Sen.

Kamala Harris answered in the affirmative. \u201cHe has committed crimes in plain sight,\u201d she said, adding, in reference to her previous career as a prosecutor, \u201cI know a confession when I see it.\u201d\n\nOther candidates, including Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Sen. Cory Booker, Julian Castro and Pete Buttigieg, also agreed in their calls for impeachment. Andrew Yang became the first candidate to move from talking about impeachment to topics like automation and job loss \u2014 topics he said voters cared about more. \u201cWhy did Donald Trump win your state by eight points?\u201d he asked about voters in Ohio, where the debate was held. \u201cBecause we got rid of 300,000 manufacturing jobs in your towns?\u201d\n\nHe added, referring to Trump, \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about him, we\u2019re losing.\u201d\n\nSanders says he\u2019s \u201cfeeling great\u201d when asked about recent health scare\n\nAfter suffering a heart attack at the beginning of October, Bernie Sanders attempted to quell worry over his capacity for the presidency during the debate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m healthy. I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d he said when the debate moderator turned to the topic of his health.\n\nAsked how he would reassure Democratic voters that he\u2019s up to the stress of being president, Sanders issued an invitation to his upcoming campaign rally on Saturday in Queens, N.Y, touting a \u201cspecial guest\u201d who would make an appearance. Sanders then thanked his team and colleagues for their love and support in the aftermath of his heart attack.\n\nButtigieg calls out O\u2019Rourke on \u201ccourage\u201d\n\nAt the previous debate in September, O\u2019Rourke made waves with his statement on assault rifles that \u201chell yes,\u201d he would \u201ctake your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d\n\nBut at Tuesday\u2019s debate, Buttigieg got possibly the most notable line of an exchange on guns.As for how he would actually enforce weapon buybacks, the former Texas congressman said, \u201cIf someone does not turn in an AR-15 or an AK-47\u2026then that weapon will be taken from them. If they persist, there will be other consequences.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful former Texas representative Beto O'Rourke speaks during the fourth Democratic primary debate of the 2020 presidential campaign season in Westerville, Ohio on Oct. 15, 2019. | Saul Loeb\u2014AFP via Getty Images More\n\nButtigieg argued that O\u2019Rourke hadn\u2019t laid out a plan of action. \u201cYou just made it clear that you don\u2019t know how this is actually going to take weapons off the streets.\u201d In O\u2019Rourke\u2019s retort, he suggested that Buttigieg should \u201cnot be limited by the polls, and the consultants and the focus groups, let\u2019s do what\u2019s right while we have time to do what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nBut Buttigieg, an openly gay veteran, came swinging with a sting. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage \u2014 political or personal.\u201d\n\nPete Buttigieg and Tulsi Gabbard square off on Syria\n\nTulsi Gabbard and Pete Buttigieg, the only two veterans in the debate, sparred sharply over the U.S.\u2019s policy in Syria. Earlier this month, the Trump Administration announced plans to withdraw troops from northeastern Syria, which critics have argued abandons U.S. Kurdish allies, who were key in the fight against ISIS.\n\nGabbard, an Iraq war veteran who has a strong anti-war stance, has called for U.S. withdrawal from the region, arguing that U.S. involvement in a \u201cregime change\u201d war in Syria has increased casualties and the refugee crisis. Cooper asked Gabbard how her withdrawal of troops would be different from President Trump\u2019s. She responded that people need to understand that the \u201cslaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war that we\u2019ve been raging in Syria.\u201d She argued that in addition to the President, many politicians on both sides of the aisle, as well as members of the mainstream media, have the \u201cblood of the Kurds\u201d on their hands because they have supported the war.\n\nGabbard has faced criticism for her approach toward Syria in the past. In 2017, she traveled to Syria to meet with dictator Bashar al-Assad, who has been condemned for using chemical weapons against his own citizens. Gabbard has since said that Assad is a \u201cbrutal dictator,\u201d but still opposes U.S. involvement in the region.\n\nRepresentative for Hawaii Tulsi Gabbard speaks onstage during the fourth Democratic primary debate of the 2020 presidential campaign season in Westerville, Ohio on October 15, 2019. | Saul Loeb\u2014AFP via Getty Images More\n\nThe Obama Administration backed rebel forces in the Syria civil war against al-Assad, and allied with a largely Syrian Kurdish militia in the fight against ISIS in the region. During Tuesday\u2019s debate, Gabbard said she would end \u201cregime change wars\u201d with two tools: ending \u201cdraconian\u201d sanctions, and making sure \u201cwe stop support terrorists like Al Qaeda in Syria.\u201d Gabbard then asked Warren to join her to call for an end of U.S. involvement in Syria. Warren said she opposes U.S. involvement in the Middle East, but wants to withdraw in the \u201cright way.\u201d\n\nButtigieg, a former intelligence officer in the U.S. Navy who served in Afghanistan, then jumped in to strongly oppose Gabbard\u2019s suggested strategy. \u201cI think that is dead wrong,\u201d he told her. \u201cThe slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it is a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this President of American allies and American values,\u201d he said. He continued that while he opposed the Iraq war and wants to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, \u201cit\u2019s also the case that a small number of specialized special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we\u2019re seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.\u201d\n\nGabbard responded that Buttigieg appeared to be saying that he wants to keep troops in the region for an indefinite period of time, stay in a war that \u201chas undermined our national security,\u201d and continue the U.S. policy of providing arms to terrorist groups on the ground against Assad. But Buttigieg shook his head as he disagreed with her characterization. \u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy as you\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.\u201c Will you end the regime change war is the question,\u201d she responded.\u201cWhat were doing in Syria was keeping our word,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up too.\u201d\n\nA moment for reproductive rights\n\nBoth Cory Booker and Kamala Harris brought up reproductive rights early on in Tuesday\u2019s debate, so they certainly were prepared when CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett asked the candidates about those states which were engaged in restricting abortion rights.\n\nOn the choice to have a child, Harris said, \u201cOur bodies were created to do that, and it does not give any other person the right to tell a woman what to do with that body. It is her body. It is her right. It is her decision.\u201d\n\nBooker, who earlier in the night said that \u201cwomen should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight,\u201d proposed a plan to make an \u201coffice of reproductive freedom and reproductive rights\u201d in his White House if elected. Klobuchar used her response to call out Trump for defunding Planned Parenthood. \u201cDonald Trump, you are not on the side of women,\u201d she said.\n\nMany candidates, including Biden and Booker, said that they would work towards codifying Roe v. Wade to prevent states from criminalizing abortions.Warren used her experience to comment on how class can impact access to abortion. \u201cI lived in America where abortions were illegal,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd rich women still got abortions.\u201d", "description": "Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will meet in Ohio in a 2020 Democratic Debate.
