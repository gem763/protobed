The starchy butler Carson, the bon-mot-slinging Dowager Countess, the chauffeur-turned-family-member Tom Branson \u2026\n\nBut food, food has always been a star, too \u2014 the teas and puddings and roasts and cakes and souffles, around which both the downstairs servants and the upstairs British aristocrats banter and scheme.\n\nThat tradition continues in the new movie, where food not only serves as a lush prop painting a picture of life in an opulent country estate, circa 1927, but as a key agent of the plot, which centers on a visit by King George V and Queen Mary that upends life at Downton and conveniently ushers in new characters to join the soapy goings-on.\n\n[On \u2018Downton Abbey,\u2019 aspic matters]\n\nIn the two-hour film, the procurement, storage, preparation and presentation of food is the crux of the action among Downton\u2019s staff. And upstairs, as ever, the drama revolves around the table. At least twice, (mild spoiler alert!) food is used as a weapon in one of the movie\u2019s central conflicts: the battle between the Crawley family\u2019s staff and the visiting battalion of royal servants imported to Downton for the monarch\u2019s visit.\n\n\u201cA royal luncheon, a parade and a dinner? I\u2019m going to have to sit-down!\u201d sputters Mrs. Patmore, the oft-beleaguered cook of the family estate, in an early scene. Another not-so-spoiler: She doesn\u2019t sit, or at least for long, and the household is swiftly caught up in a whirlwind of preparation.\n\nSo, too, was the film\u2019s production team. When Lisa Heathcote, the food stylist responsible for nearly every crumb that appears at the fictional Downton estate, first saw the movie script, she was delighted at the prominent role that food played.\n\n\n\n(Stacy Zarin Goldberg for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\n[Make the recipe: Madeira Cake]\n\nAnd she was mindful that on the big screen, it would be even more important than in the TV series for the food to look real, a feat she accomplishes by \u2026 using real food, which also has the benefit of allowing the actors to munch as they see fit. She admits, though, that there is one real fake-out amid all the other actually edible dishes in the movie \u2014 but she wouldn\u2019t cop to what it was. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say!\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing. I thought, \u2018Well, it\u2019s quick and nobody will notice.\u2019 [Otherwise] I make sure it\u2019s all real food and it\u2019s as it would have been.\u201d\n\n(Downton fans, consider this a challenge.)\n\nOne word in the script, though, stopped her in her tracks: souffle. The airy, eggy dish is a known diva of the food world \u2014 so finicky and prone to collapsing that it\u2019s a metaphor for things that deflate. And Heathcote needed lots of them, since they were served at the dinner for the king and queen.\n\nUsing the tricks in her food-wizardry arsenal, she faked the ones perched on the tray of a footman, who gets lectured by the kitchen maid, Daisy, to get them upstairs \u201cbefore they fall!\u201d Gelatin whipped into the mix assured they could last through multiple takes.\n\nBut in a later scene at the dinner table, after the souffles have been served, Heathcote went with the unadulterated dish (since the actors had to actually eat them). She prepped hundreds of them in a food truck she parks outside of Highclere Castle, the estate that serves as Downton\u2019s set. \u201cI had to run from my truck across the car park with the souffles like a madwoman,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the time I got there, they were looking very sorry for themselves.\u201d Luckily, the scene takes place midcourse. \u201cBy that time, the souffles would have already fallen anyway!\u201d\n\n[The secret to a light, airy, textbook souffle? Stop trying so hard.]\n\nSimilar finessing was required for what might be the movie\u2019s crucial food moment.\n\nAs Team Downton tries to wrest control of the dinner away from the king\u2019s supercilious retinue (including a French chef, who only sharpens our favorite servants\u2019 patriotic pride), they engage in some subterfuge. A pot of sauce spilled on an immaculate shirt at an inopportune moment gets one character out of the way, allowing the wily Crawley loyalists to have their way.\n\nThe weaponized concoction posed a challenge for Heathcote: It had to be just the right consistency to cling to the fabric onto which it was flung. \u201cI spent a lot of time throwing things against the wall to see how it would behave,\u201d she said. In the end, she landed on a mixture of fruit puree, syrup, water and corn flour \u201cso it would really stick.\u201d\n\n(As for the second instance in which food is used in the scheme, let\u2019s just say guests at Downton would do well to avoid lady\u2019s maid Anna\u2019s offerings of tea.)\n\n\n\nSophie McShera (left) as Daisy Mason and Lesley Nicol as Mrs. Patmore. (Jaap Buitendijk/Focus Features)\n\nThat kind of attention to detail plays out in ways the audience might never notice. Rather than giving actors busywork just for the sake of having something to do, Heathcote says she\u2019s always mindful of what would have been happening in the Downton kitchen at a given time of day or season. The film is set in late summer, so Daisy is shown in one scene preparing a piccalilli, a British pickled-vegetable concoction flavored with mustard powder and seed, a dish that a cook might have made to take advantage of the gardens\u2019 bounty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a random bit of carrot or onion, which seems to happen in film all the time and is sort of daft,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a story and fluidity, and it\u2019s all making sense.\u201d\n\n[The no-frills, very British way to host an afternoon tea]\n\nHeathcote is clearly willing to share some of the secrets to making dining at Downton look delectable, but she isn\u2019t spilling all the Earl Grey. Another subject on which she\u2019s tight-lipped (what happens on the Downton set, apparently, stays on the set): Given that all the food lying around set is edible at worst and delicious at best, who among the cast members is the biggest eater? \u201cI know who it is,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t say!\u201d\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nIn Ali Wong\u2019s new Netflix rom-com, food is the butt of jokes \u2014 and her true love\n\nMerriam-Webster toasts an expanding food and drink vocabulary with a \u2018tallboy\u2019 and \u2018matcha\u2019\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is tardy to the chicken-sandwich party with a spicy entry that can\u2019t touch Popeyes\u2019", "description": "Your favorite characters are on the big screen, and so are your favorite teas, roasts and puddings.", "authors": ["Emily Heil", "Food Reporter", "Emily Heil Is A Reporter Covering National Food News", "Trends.
