We look for these opportunities all around the country, to the extent that they have South African founders or have a marketplace in South Africa,\u201d Mahanyele-Dabengwa told TechCrunch.\n\nFounders from other parts of Africa with startup operations in South Africa can be considered for funding, she clarified.\n\nNaspers Foundry will back companies that align with the internet business\u2019s Naspers focuses on \u2014 such as food, payments, or classifieds \u2014 and any other digital venture that addresses a societal need.\n\nOn financing size, the Foundry will make equity investments in various amounts primarily from Series A up to Series B, according to Mahanyele-Dabengwa.\n\nPre-series funding won\u2019t be on the table, for now, but could be at some point. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking to our stakeholders\u2026and there really is a need [in the region] for much more earlier stage [investment]. So we are giving thought to that,\u201d she said.\n\nNaspers Foundry is already engaged in outreach screening activity, but does have a rolling application call on its website open to any startup that meets specific criteria.\n\nHeading up review of online investment applications is Minette Havemann, Naspers Foundry\u2019s Strategy Director.\n\nOn her role in recruiting and determining startup investments, Mahanyele-Dabengwa points to her market experience.\n\nShe comes to head Naspers Foundry after several finance capital positions, including founding and running Sigma Capital Group, a Johannesburg based private equity fund. Prior to that, Mahanyele-Dabengwa was CEO of Shanduka Group, an investment holding company formed by South Africa\u2019s current president, Cyril Ramaposa.\n\nShe has experience in the U.S. and U.K., having obtained academic degrees in both countries.\n\nThere\u2019s also some precedent in her new role, as Mahanyele-Dabengwa is the first female and first black chief executive in Naspers\u2019 104 year history.\n\nFor its VC allocation, Naspers Foundry will make investments over a three year period. The Foundry is part of a 1.4 billion rand (\u2248$314 million) overall commitment by Naspers to support South Africa\u2019s tech sector.\n\nAs a firm, Naspers is on the top 100 largest global companies list \u2014 85th by its $108 billion market cap, just after Nike\u2014and is one the world\u2019s largest tech investors.\n\nAside from operating notable internet, video, and entertainment platforms, Naspers has made significant investments in Europe, India, Asia, and South America.\n\nNaspers was also an early investor in Chinese tech group Tencent, selling $10 billion in shares this year after a $32 million investment in 2001.\n\nThe company recently carved out a new holding company, called Prosus NV, to relist a portion of its assets on Amsterdam\u2019s Euronext stock exchange.\n\nThough Naspers Foundry will not back startups outside South Africa, Mahanyele-Dabengwa noted that its parent \u2014 Naspers \u2014 can finance ventures anywhere on the continent, if it sees the right opportunity.\n\nThe South African media group has invested less in (and been less successful) in Africa, in contrast to its robust global activities.\n\nOne of Naspers\u2019 early Africa investments, Nigerian e-commerce startup Konga, was sold in a distressed acquisition in 2018.\n\nThe company recently added around $70 million to its commitment to South African e-commerce site Takealot and made one of the largest acquisitions in Africa this September, buying South Africa\u2019s Webuycars for $94 million.\n\nThe $100 million fund Phuthi Mahanyele-Dabengwa leads could help South Africa surge in Africa\u2019s increasingly competitive tech landscape.\n\nThe country was previously an unquestioned leader and outlier on the continent for its tech scene and VC investment. But over the last decade South Africa has been rivaled on venture capital and startup formation by Kenya and Nigeria.\n\nIn Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem \u2014 that only recently surpassed $1 billion annually in VC funding \u2014 Naspers Foundry\u2019s $100 million could shift the startup financing lead back toward South Africa.", "description": "Naspers\u2019 1.4 billion rand (\u2248$100 million) VC fund to support South African startups \u2014 Naspers Foundry \u2014 is accepting pitches, after making its first investment in online cleaning services company SweepSouth.
