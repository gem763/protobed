As chief executive, it is her duty to take all responsibility. As she is the one who is in charge of passing laws, she should pay the price for her actions. Her performance as chief executive has not been as good as we hoped, so I think it is time she step down from her post.\n\nTommy Cheung, 16, Fung Kai No. 1 Secondary School\n\nWhether Carrie Lam should step down depends heavily on her actions in the coming months. The chief executive is, some may say, notoriously known for her stubbornness: refusing to take back her words, not easily at least. If a series of heart-wrenching events could not cast her any doubts on the appropriateness of the government\u2019s attitude, then stepping down would be the only right choice, even if she is determined not to do so. Hong Kong is in desperate need of a change, otherwise there will be no turning back.\n\nIan Chiu Yi-nap, 15, Po Leung Kuk Tang Yuk Tien College\n\nI don\u2019t think she should. Her behaviour has fuelled a lot of people\u2019s anger in the city, but if she were to step down now, I think there would be no suitable person who would like to take up her role. I don\u2019t think her stepping down would end all the protests in Hong Kong. I hope she will make better choices and make sure Hong Kong doesn\u2019t become a dead city. I hope this crisis will end soon.\n\nDiana Yiu, 12, Pope Paul VI College\n\nHong Kong protests: What are the 'five demands'? What do protesters want?\n\nI think she should. Protests have been going on in the city since June, and there aren\u2019t any signs of it calming down anytime soon. Carrie Lam is the one who created this situation. The protests have led to violent clashes between citizens and the police, leading to lost of injuries and arrests. Lam must take full responsibility for all of that, for causing hatred and instability in the city, and step down.\n\nTina Li Nga-kwan, 14, Pope Paul VI College\n\nI think it is not only the chief executives job to lead the government and enforce laws, but also to listen to the public\u2019s opinion. Hong Kong people have been demonstrating their dissatisfaction of Lam and the government\u2019s actions since June, and the government has done nothing to end the chaos but condemn the protester\u2019s violence. I think the protesters\u2019 demand for a commission of inquiry into alleged police brutality is an important one that needs to be met. Lam has given the protesters this. Some think it is because she is being controlled by the Chinese government. If this is so, how can she lead the Hong Kong people? If she does not have her own people\u2019s best interests at heart then she must step down.\n\nLei Kar-wah, 17, Pok Oi Hospital 80th Anniversary Tang Ying Hei College\n\nOver the past three months, Carrie Lam has proven herself to be an inept chief executive. For me, she needs to do more than step down, I think she owes us a sincere apology. During her campaign for chief executive, she promised she would resign if mainstream opinion was against her. Her popularity rating is by far the lowest among all the former chief executives of Hong Kong, but she still refuses to step down. We can\u2019t have a liar for a leader, and allow her to continue to cause trouble in our city.\n\nMarco Ng, 16, Fung Kai No. 1 Secondary School\n\nProtesters throw cardboard on a fire in the Central district of Hong Kong on October 1, 2019. Photo: Bloomberg\n\nI\u2019m not sure. Personally, I really want her to step down as chief executive as she\u2019s made such a big mistake by promoting the extradition bill. However I\u2019m not sure if she should, because I cannot think of anyone who would replace her, I don\u2019t think anyone wants to.\n\nTeresa Kwok, 14, South Island School\n\nI don\u2019t think Carrie Lam should step down because she has fulfilled her election campaign slogan \u201cwe connect\u201d. She has successfully brought together Hongkongers with a common goal. We need her to stay so we can stay connected. I don\u2019t think her stepping down will end the crisis. Even if we had a new chief executive, the new one might be controlled by the Chinese government.\n\nTammy Wong Pui-yi, 17, Pok Oi Hospital 80th Anniversary Tang Ying Hei College\n\nI think she needs to step down, but not right now. It is clear that she does not have the ability to lead Hong Kong, as she has only made the situation in the city worse over the past few months. But if she were to step down now, I\u2019m afraid Hong Kong would not be able to find someone to replace her at such short notice. The timing is not so ideal.\n\nKenny Chan Wing-ho, 17, Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Mrs. Wu York Yu memorial College\n\nOpinion: Condemning violent protests doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love Hong Kong\n\nFor me, it is a definite yes. Simply because of all the chaos she has created in Hong Kong. Her actions and attitude are really angering the young people in the city, as their futures will be most affected. Instead of trying to calm the protesters who were angered by the extradition bill, she is only creating more laws and restrictions, which would obviously make the protesters even more angry. If she continues to be stubborn then I fear she will destroy Hong Kong\u2019s economy and reputation. This is why I think she needs to step down right away.\n\nMahmood Eshal Taghbeen, 14, Pope Paul VI College\n\nIn our next Talking Points, we\u2019ll discuss:\n\nShould cannabis be legalised in Hong Kong?\n\nWe are now accepting your answers for this topic.
