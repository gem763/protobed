REUTERS/Altaf Hussain\n\nBENGALURU (Reuters) - India\u2019s central bank on Wednesday mandated banks to link certain loans to the external benchmark based interest rate from Oct. 1, in a bid to allow faster transmission of its rate cuts to consumers.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said banks were not satisfactorily transferring the cuts in policy rates. The RBI said lenders would now have to link all new floating rate personal or retail loans and floating rate loans to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to an external benchmark.\n\nLast month, the RBI lowered its benchmark interest rates for a fourth straight meeting with a slightly bigger than expected 35 basis points cut, underscoring its worries about India\u2019s near-five-year-low economic growth pace.", "description": "India's central bank on Wednesday mandated banks to link certain loans to the external benchmark based interest rate from Oct. 1, in a bid to allow faster transmission of its rate cuts to consumers.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426178953&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF831E1"}
