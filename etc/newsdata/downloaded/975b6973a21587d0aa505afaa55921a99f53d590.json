Bezos plainly saw how shopping centers and malls gave people a happy feeling of community, of a physical place to go, and he knew Amazon couldn\u2019t recreate it.\n\nBezos\u2019s acknowledgement of Amazon\u2019s limits proved a window into the company\u2019s future. Amid rising pessimism about the future of bricks & mortar retail, Bezos is an optimist. He is investing many billions in the physical shopping locations that he\u2019s long stressed Amazon can\u2019t recreate. Market statistics support what Bezos is doing. Popular as online shopping is, it still accounts for well under 10% of total retail sales.\n\nPlainly eager for Amazon to be a player in the portion of retail that is largest, by far, Bezos is investing many billions as previously mentioned. There are Amazon bookstores, Amazon Go stores that will free the rushed buyer from checkout lines, there\u2019s Amazon\u2019s acquisition of grocery chain Whole Foods, and there will surely be many more endeavors. Irony of ironies, one of the few public business figures who openly expresses his belief that bricks & mortar retailing has a brilliant future is the man largely credited with destroying this allegedly \u201cold economy\u201d way of catering to acquisitive customers. Happily Bezos isn\u2019t the only believer.\n\nIndeed, to walk into a Lowe\u2019s, or a Home Depot, or a Target, Walmart, or Costco location, is to be reminded that media members have a tendency to warp perception. Traditional retail, and big shopping centers are dead\u2026unless we remember the myriad big store businesses that continue to thrive. It\u2019s not that old retail is dying as much as it\u2019s rapidly changing, and in the process leaving those stuck in the past behind. This is the stuff of economic dynamism. The future rarely resembles the past in places where there\u2019s growth.\n\nFigure that the malls of the past included video rental stores, Orange Julius fast food outlets, and Radio Shacks. The previous truth requires consideration as some in our midst parrot the popular view that retail is over with, that shopping malls will never again be relevant again, that Toys \u2018R Us, Circuit City and Sears failed not because they were no longer meeting the needs of their customers, but because of the \u201cinternet.\u201d Conventional wisdom is yet again unacceptable. In a dynamic economy that which is stationary is a sitting duck, just waiting to be put out of business. It\u2019s a reminder that investment is the driver of economic growth, not consumption. Investment is the process whereby the future is rushed into the present. Happily it\u2019s happening with shopping malls.\n\nAs the Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend about American Dream, \u201cthe most expensive U.S. mall ever built,\u201d the shopping center is being re-imagined in exciting ways. Investors are still willing to back what aims to be different with enormous sums of money. American Dream will surely be different. Consider the Journal\u2019s description of this new kind of shopping center:\n\n\u201cOn one end, you can glimpse multiple ski lifts for a 16-story indoor ski hill, the largest in the Western Hemisphere. Across a professional size ice rink is the hemisphere\u2019s biggest enclosed amusement park, the 8-acre Nickelodeon Universe \u2013 a colorful jumble of roller coaster tracks and rides. Next to that is the DreamWorks Waterpark, the largest indoor water park in North America, with a wave pool and 40 slides.\u201d\n\nSo this is the new shopping center; one bereft of shopping? No doubt the pessimists in our midst might assume just that since, you know, \u201cAmazon is putting retailers out of business,\u201d but reality is something else entirely. Though American Dream will be the first consumer shopping concept to \u201cdevote more space to entertainment, restaurants and theme-park rides\u201d than to traditional retail, there will be copious amounts of the latter in what will, if successful, lure more than 40 million visitors per year to the historically unattractive Meadowlands area of New Jersey. According to the Journal, there will be more than 450 retail outlets that customers will be able to shop in when they\u2019re not availing themselves of the endless entertainment options situated on the 90 acre site. Readers can rest assured these retailers aren\u2019t taking space at the American Dream to lose money.\n\n\u201cWhen you walk through, we want you to be awed, jawdropped, inspired.\u201d Those are the words of Don Ghermezian, creator of the American Dream, as told to the Journal. One imagines that it would be a joy to witness Ghermezian and Bezos talking retail. What amazing ideas must rush through their minds! Many of Ghermezian\u2019s will be bad ones, Bezos has had a few, but the greatest entrepreneurs who really improve the world and our living standards fail with great regularity. We need people like Bezos and Ghermezian who, eager to try new things, reveal to us wants we never knew we had.\n\nGhermezian wants to awe us with an entirely new shopping experience, Bezos did with online shopping, continues to do so, plus with the Go stores he plainly aims to awe us in new ways. \u201cBricks & mortar retail is dead\u201d is such a lazy, economically illiterate comment. It\u2019s lazy because it presumes that businesses can remain vibrant by offering customers the same as ever. Sorry, but that\u2019s never been true. Lest readers forget, few were demanding the world\u2019s plenty with a click of a mouse before Bezos, and few were demanding a smaller amount of plenty through the then highly advanced catalogue before Sears made it possible. It\u2019s economically illiterate because it presumes that consumption powers growth, as opposed to investment that enhances our consumptive ability all the while transforming how we consume. Economists are illiterate about the economy. Think about it.\n\nLooking ahead, it\u2019s exciting to imagine what\u2019s next. Economically dynamic economies are defined by relentless replacement of the past, which means that Bezos and Ghermezian will eventually be replaced by the dreamers of tomorrow; that, or the businesses they created will be. We\u2019re awestruck now, so imagine what the future holds if the economy remains free such that Amazon and American Dream are rendered yesterday\u2019s news. Retail isn\u2019t dead, rather what used to entertain us is. And that\u2019s a beautiful thing.", "description": "In an interview given roughly twenty years ago when Amazon was largely a peddler of books, CDs, and DVDs, founder Jeff Bezos observed to a reporter that his nascent company would never replace the...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.realclear.com/images/49/492630_5_.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
