But the mass rallies throughout Chile have forced Pinera to change tact and tone, upending his policy goals and now, forcing overhaul his cabinet.\n\nPinera is looking to \u201cbuy time\u201d by announcing the reshuffle and putting all of his ministers on notice, said Luc\u00eda Dammert, a political analyst with Santiago-based think-tank Espacio P\u00fablico. But, she said Chileans would not wait much longer for specifics.\n\nA demonstrator gestures near a burning barricade, during anti-government protests, in Concepcion, Chile October 26, 2019.

He has promised to boost the minimum wage and pensions, ditch fare hikes on public transportation and fix the country\u2019s ailing health care system.\n\nWEEKEND OFF\n\nThe riots, which decimated swaths of the city\u00b4s metro and wrought nearly $1 billion in damages to business, prompted Pinera to declare a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d and place the military in charge of security across large swaths of the country.\n\nHeavily armed soldiers manning roadblocks have enforced strict nightly curfews around the city for seven days.\n\nSpeaking with reporters Saturday morning, Pinera said he would lift the state of emergency on Sunday evening at midnight \u201cif circumstances allow.\u201d\n\nChile\u00b4s military said in a statement it would not enforce a curfew on Saturday night, adding the city \u201chad tended to normalcy...thanks to the contribution of all of its citizens.\u201d\n\nThroughout the day Saturday, protesters gathered in Santiago\u2019s central plazas, rallying peacefully but in much smaller numbers than on Friday night, when more than 1 million people took to the streets.\n\nProtests and occasional skirmishes with security forces continued in other Chilean cities.\n\nSlideshow (20 Images)\n\nAs evening fell on Santiago, many citizens emerged on terraces and street corners, returning to a nightly routine of banging pots with wooden spoons to show solidarity with protester\u00b4s demands.\n\nU.N. human rights boss Michelle Bachelet, a former president of Chile, has called for independent investigations into the deaths in weekend protests. Amnesty International has also said it will send a fact-finding mission to Chile amid allegations of abuses.", "description": "Chilean President Sebastian Pinera on Saturday added a major cabinet reshuffle to a growing list of reforms he has promised to tame inequality and quell mass protests that have rocked the South American nation.", "authors": ["Dave Sherwood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445352715&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q01B", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
