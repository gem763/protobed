The Kurds were until just a few weeks ago among America's close allies.\n\nSince then concerns have grown among US lawmakers that America's withdrawal will enable the return of Islamic State and enable Russian influence in the region.\n\nSenator Linsey Graham said the President is making the same mistakes as Obama. Getty\n\nAmong Mr Trump's most vehement critics are some of his closest allies, including South Carolina Senator and regular golfing partner Linsey Graham, who accused Mr Trump of making the same mistakes as his predecessor Barack Obama.\n\n\"The worst thing any Commander-in-Chief can do is to give land back to the enemy that was taken through blood and sacrifice,\" Mr Graham said on Twitter. \"I fear those are the consequences of the actions being taken right now.\"\n\nSenator Graham urged the president to \"listen to your own national security team\" about the consequences of his decision and its impact on the US.\n\nBlistering rebuke\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe House of Representatives registered its first formal rebuke of Mr Trump over the Syrian crisis with a motion, which also urged Turkey to halt military operations, that passed by 354 to 60 votes. It included a majority of Republicans in the chamber.\n\nMr Trump spent much of Wednesday denying responsibility for the latest crisis in Syria, and insisted his actions were about meeting his promise to voters in 2016 to withdraw Americans from foreign wars.\n\nLoading\n\n\"The Kurds know how to fight, and, as I said, they're not angels. They're not angels,\" he said.\n\nMr Trump called his decision to withdraw US troops from an area where they served as a kind of buffer to Turkish aggression in the region \"strategically brilliant\".\n\nLetter to Erdogan\n\nThe White House also released a letter to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, dated October 9, warning him against becoming \"responsible for slaughtering thousands of people\".\n\n\"Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool! I will call you later,\" Mr Trump wrote in the letter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe withdrawal happened last week after a phone call with Mr Erdogan on October 6, ending five years of US foreign policy aimed at protecting Syria's Kurds.\n\nMost analysts say Mr Trump's decision provided a green light for Turkish forces last week to attack the Syrian Kurdish militia that were Washington's close allies in the fight against Islamic State militants who once held swathes of Iraq and Syria.\n\nMr Trump has sent Vice-President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Ankara, where they expect to meet with Mr Erdogan - a key NATO ally - on Thursday.\n\nFor his part, the Turkish leader has insisted there will be no ceasefire, and said he might call off a visit to the US in November because of the \"very big disrespect\" shown by US politicians.\n\nThe US on Monday imposed a series of economic sanctions on Turkey, and this has also inflamed relations with the Erdogan.\n\nSources say the assault by Turkish forces has triggered a humanitarian crisis in which 160,000 civilians have had to flee their homes. Questions are also flying about on whether some 1000 ISIS fighters have been abandoned in Kurdish jails.\n\nSyrian government forces, backed by Washington's adversaries Russia and Iran in the more than eight-year-old civil war have, meanwhile, have taken advantage of the power vacuum left by US troops to advance swiftly into the largest swathe of territory previously outside their grasp.\n\nWith Reuters", "description": "\"Don't be a tough guy.
