The company survived and prospered during the next 90 years and seems to be in a healthy shape in 2019. People will always need home-improvement products and Masco will probably be around for many years.\n\nHowever, as the prospects for the global economy get darker, is it time for investors to put their money in Masco stock? This is the question we hope to answer with the help of the Elliott Wave principle and the chart below.\n\nMasco Corp Weekly Chart\n\nMasco\u2019s weekly chart reveals the stock\u2019s entire progress from $3.20 in March 2009. Ten and a half years later, MAS closed at $42.51 last week, up 1228% since 2009 excluding the dividends. To put it mildly, the last decade has been very generous to Masco shareholders.\n\nMasco\u2018s Uptrend Coming to an End?\n\nHowever, extrapolating the past into the future can be very dangerous in the stock market. No trend lasts forever and the chart above suggests Masco\u2019s won\u2019t either. It shows that the rally from $3.20 has taken the shape of a five-wave impulse whose wave 5 is currently developing.\n\nWave 5 is supposed to exceed wave 3 and reach a new all-time high near $50 a share. This means Masco can add another ~20% to its market value in the short-term. Unfortunately for the bulls, the theory states that a three-wave correction follows every impulse.\n\nOnce wave 5 is over, a corrective pullback can be expected to drag the price back down to the support area of wave 4 near $25. If this count is correct, the anticipated recession can erase roughly 50% of Masco\u2019s market cap. Not that bad compared to the 2005-2009 period when it lost 90.5%.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Stocks Analysis by EWM Interactive  covering: Masco Corporation.
