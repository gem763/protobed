Envoy, Testifies Trump Delegated Ukraine Policy to Giuliani", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, told House impeachment investigators on Thursday that President Trump delegated American foreign policy on Ukraine to his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, a directive he said he disagreed with but nonetheless followed.\n\nMr. Sondland, a Trump campaign donor who has emerged as a central figure in the Ukraine scandal, testified under subpoena that he did not understand until later that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s goal may have been an effort \u201cto involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the president\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign.\u201d\n\nAccording to a copy of his opening statement to investigators, which was obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Sondland said Mr. Trump refused the counsel of his top diplomats, who recommended that he meet with the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky , without any preconditions. The president said the diplomats needed to satisfy concerns that both he and Mr. Giuliani had related to corruption in Ukraine, Mr. Sondland asserted.\n\n\u201cWe were also disappointed by the president\u2019s direction that we involve Mr. Giuliani,\u201d Mr. Sondland said. \u201cOur view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the president\u2019s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine.\u201d", "description": "Mr. Sondland said in his testimony to House impeachment investigators that he was disappointed the president involved his personal lawyer in diplomacy with Kiev.", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos", "Michael S.
