Elise Stefanik specifically raised concerns about data sharing. | Hans Pennink/AP Photo\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nSTATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT, released this morning: \"Hamza bin Ladin, the high-ranking al-Qa\u2019ida member and son of Usama bin Ladin, was killed in a United States counterterrorism operation in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region. The loss of Hamza bin Ladin not only deprives al-Qa\u2019ida of important leadership skills and the symbolic connection to his father, but undermines important operational activities of the group. Hamza bin Ladin was responsible for planning and dealing with various terrorist groups.\"\n\n-- THIS WAS REPORTED at the end of July. This is official confirmation.\n\nWHAT REPUBLICANS ARE TALKING ABOUT \u2026 MELANIE ZANONA in Baltimore: \u201cRepublicans clash with Trump-aligned operatives\u201d: \u201cHouse Republicans sparred behind closed doors with Trump-aligned political operatives at a GOP retreat over the new online fundraising platform backed by party leaders and the White House.\n\n\u201cThe fight Thursday over WinRed's data and competitiveness highlights long simmering tensions between GOP lawmakers and operatives allied with the president, and underscores the growing frustrations in the party as they try to hash out a strategy to win back the House next year. \u2026\n\n\u201cDuring a testy exchange on the first day of the House GOP\u2019s annual retreat, members expressed misgivings with WinRed, a small donor apparatus designed to compete with the Democrats\u2019 online fundraising behemoth ActBlue that was launched this summer by the national campaign arms after months of delays.\n\n\u201cRep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) specifically raised concerns about data sharing, while other lawmakers were confused with how the operation works and pressed operatives for more information about the fundraising tool, according to aides and lawmakers who were present.\n\n\u201cStefanik, who formerly led recruitment efforts for the GOP\u2019s campaign arm, pressed WinRed president Gerrit Lansing about whether lawmakers who use the apparatus would have to share their data with other people and questioned how it could be protected, several sources said.\n\n\u201cLansing tried to assure lawmakers that their data is their own. But Stefanik expressed worry that once information is shared with the RNC\u2019s clearinghouse for voter information, Data Trust, other people \u2014 including primary opponents \u2014 can access it. Lansing however, warned members that if they don\u2019t build their donor files, they risk getting crushed by ActBlue again.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- ALMOST NO ONE AT THE WHITE HOUSE or in GOP leadership wants to hear this, but WinRed has a big issue on its hands. Members of Congress are skeptical of them, because they don\u2019t know who is profiting off of it and they can\u2019t get straight answers about what\u2019s going to happen with their data.\n\nTHE RETORT FROM REPUBLICANS involved is, trust us, get on board or else you\u2019ll continue to get smoked by your Democratic opponents. That\u2019s probably true, but lawmakers want answers and they aren\u2019t getting them. And until then, there is going to be angst and doubts -- no matter how many presentations they get, or veiled threats they hear from the leadership and White House-linked operatives. Of course, there are members who have signed up -- more than 100 -- and the service is drawing donations. That does not negate the skepticism.\n\nREMEMBER: Republicans -- pushed by Jared Kushner -- created WinRed to compete with ActBlue. But ActBlue was a private company that caught fire because it was good. WinRed is being foisted upon lawmakers by the party leadership.\n\nBIDEN BEHIND THE SCENES, pool report from the Houston Chronicle\u2019s Jeremy Wallace of a Biden fundraiser in the River Oaks section of Houston yesterday: \u201c\u2018Last night [the debate] I thought was a good night. (Applause) I think I could have done better. I will do better, God willing.\u2019 \u2018The fact of the matter is for the first time we had something approaching a debate.\u2019 Said past debates have been \u2018one minute assertions and 30 second attacks\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018This is about the future, this is not about the past.

Biden Jr. and Elizabeth Warren are headed for a showdown, neither of them appears in a hurry to get there.\n\n\u201cThe two candidates have seemed to be on a collision course for much of the last few months: Mr. Biden as the Democratic front-runner and de facto leader of the party\u2019s moderate wing, with a steady but hardly dominant lead in polls, and Ms. Warren as his rising challenger, slowly trimming his lead and perhaps surpassing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont as the focal point of progressive energy in the race.\u201d NYT\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

But if background checks legislation becomes law, this unusual coalition will be key. \u2026 \u2018I wouldn\u2019t bet my house on it.

Rather than encourage distance from an unpopular president, McCarthy wants Republicans to stick close to President Trump \u2014 an intentional break from the previous tension that existed between the White House and his predecessor, Paul D.

In addition to the award to the Kavanaugh nomination team, 10 other distinguished service honors will be presented this year. Those recipients include the prosecutors who worked to end a bid-rigging conspiracy against the Defense Department.\u201d NYT\n\nOPEN ARMS \u2026 AP/MOSCOW: \u201cTaliban visits Moscow days after Trump says talks \u2018dead\u2019\u201d: \u201cRussian state news agency Tass cited the Taliban\u2019s Qatar-based spokesman Suhail Shaheen as saying the delegation had held consultations with Zamir Kabulov, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s envoy for Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThe visit also was confirmed to The Associated Press by a Taliban official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters.

TIMES: \u201cCalifornia Senate evacuated after vaccine bill protester throws \u2018what appeared to be blood\u2019 onto lawmakers,\u201d by Patrick McGreevey, Melody Gutierrez, Taryn Luna and Anita Chabria, with a Sacramento dateline: \u201cA woman was arrested Friday on charges including assault after dropping what authorities said \u2018appeared to be blood\u2019 on members of the California Senate from her seat in the visitor gallery. The disturbance occurred as lawmakers were wrapping up their work before adjourning for the year, forcing them to evacuate the chamber to continue in a nearby committee hearing room.\n\n\u201cThe woman, who was identified by California Highway Patrol officials as Rebecca Dalelio, 43, was among dozens of protesters who were inside the state Capitol to oppose a pair of bills signed Monday by Gov. Gavin Newsom to impose new oversight of childhood vaccine exemptions. Public records show Dalelio is a resident of Boulder Creek near Santa Cruz, and a Facebook profile matching her photo and name contains multiple postings critical of vaccines, the last one made in March. A phone call to Dalelio seeking comment was not returned.\n\n\u201cAuthorities roped off the Senate chamber with caution tape Friday evening as CHP and Senate officers began an investigation. The CHP later said in a statement that the blood-like substance was contained in \u2018a feminine hygiene device\u2019 held by the woman, who was arrested and booked on six charges including assault, vandalism and disorderly conduct.\u201d LAT\n\nMIAMI HERALD: \u201cWas Jeffrey Epstein still traveling with underage girls?
