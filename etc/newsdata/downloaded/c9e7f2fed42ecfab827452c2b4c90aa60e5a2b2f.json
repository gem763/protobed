Things like that.\n\nCreating a screenshot from an Apple Watch isn\u2019t all that difficult, although viewing the screenshot directly on the Watch takes a few initial steps.\n\nSet your Watch to take screenshots\n\nBefore you can take a screenshot with your Watch, you need to enable the feature from the Watch app on your iPhone.\n\nOpen the Watch app on your iPhone\n\nOn the main screen, and tap \u201cGeneral\u201d\n\nScroll down to the \u201cEnable Screenshots\u201d category, and toggle it on\n\nNow you can take screenshots on your Apple Watch by pressing the Digital Crown and the side button simultaneously. (It will probably take two fingers, so this can be a somewhat awkward process.) The screen will flash white and, assuming your Watch is not muted, you\u2019ll hear a \u201cphoto snapping\u201d sound.\n\nTo see any screenshots you\u2019ve taken:\n\nGo to your iPhone\u2019s Photo app\n\nScroll down to the \u201cMedia Types\u201d section and tap on \u201cScreenshots\u201d to find your screenshots, including the ones you took with the Watch\n\nSync your album\n\nYou can also see your screenshots on your Watch, but it takes a little preparation. Specifically, you need to sync your Watch with one of the albums on your iPhone\u2019s Photos app. For example, if you want to see your most recent photos on your Watch, including your screenshots, you would set your \u201cRecently Added\u201d album to sync:\n\nOn your iPhone, open your Watch app\n\nOn the main screen, scroll down to the Photos app\n\nTap on \u201cSynced Album\u201d\n\nSelect the \u201cRecently Added\u201d album\n\nYou don\u2019t have to sync your Watch with that album, of course. For example, you can opt to sync it with your \u201cFavorites\u201d album, and then make your screenshot a Favorite photo (by long-pressing it in your iPhone\u2019s Photos app and selecting \u201cFavorite\u201d from the pop-up menu).\n\nYou can also create an album for all the photos you want on your Watch by creating a new album (called, say, \u201cWatch\u201d), syncing that album with your Watch, and using the Photos app on your iPhone to move your screenshots (and any other photos you like) to that album.", "description": "Creating a screenshot from an Apple Watch isn\u2019t all that difficult \u2014 although you can\u2019t send, view, or edit the screenshot directly from the Watch itself.", "authors": ["Barbara Krasnoff", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d9eKxOs-6ErhviuUwEDA5jDagMw=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19208788/vpavic_190913_3669_0258.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
