Nothing too special about that, except where the McDonalds should have been, there seemed to be a big white mansion. Maybe it was around back or something?\n\nAnd then I realized\u2026\n\nThe mansion was the McDonalds.\n\nHoly. Crap.\n\nThis 100+ year old Georgian mansion is indeed a McDonalds, and while well known to locals, it totally caught me by surprise. I practically expected a maitre d\u2019 to greet me as I went inside.\n\nKnown as the Denton House, its bones date back to 1795, when it was constructed as a farm house by one Joseph Denton, a descendent of the founder of the village of Hempstead. In 1860, it was given a Georgian makeover, complete with gingerbread ornamentation, and throughout the 1900\u2019s, found commercial use as a funeral home and a series of restaurants.\n\nBy 1986, it was abandoned and on the verge of falling down.\n\nMcDonalds purchased the property with the intention of tearing it down and replacing it with a standard McDonald\u2019s restaurant. Thank God for the citizens of the New Hyde Park, who worked to secure landmark status for the building in 1987.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s had no choice but to restore the property and work within the parameters of the landmarks commission, which ultimately resulted in their most beautiful restaurant in America (if you know of a better example, please let me know).\n\nIt was decided to restore the property to its 1926 appearance, based on an old photograph. Opened in the early 1990\u2019s, the house remains in fantastic shape to this day.\n\nOne of the mansion\u2019s most striking aspects is its beautiful glassed-in veranda\u2026\n\n\u2026which offers a pretty unique McDonald\u2019s eating experience (how cool would it be if it was actually open, or covered by screens?).\n\nBut the details continue around on its eastern side\u2026\n\n\u2026from its shuttered windows and brick chimneys to its eaves dripping with gingerbread ornamentation:\n\nThe western half is equally stately\u2026\n\n\u2026though, er, methinks the drive-through might not be original to the Denton farmhouse:\n\nBut had someone showed me this picture, I would have NEVER guessed it was a McDonald\u2019s.\n\nUnfortunately, the inside has been totally gutted and redone without much inspiration.\n\nStill, it is far more unique than your typical McDonald\u2019s, with a grand staircase leading to an upstairs dining area.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s something fascinating about being in an enormous open-air mansion, and I definitely appreciate how the roof has been revealed.\n\nAlmost as an afterthought, the small ordering area is nestled to one side:\n\nI love the New Hyde Park McDonald\u2019s, if for no better reason than how clearly it makes the argument for historic preservation. We can live in a world of this\u2026\n\n\u2026or this:\n\nReally don\u2019t have anything else to add.\n\n-SCOUT\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this post, would you consider making a donation to help me make my first movie?
