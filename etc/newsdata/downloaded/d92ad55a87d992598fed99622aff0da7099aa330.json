The program builds upon the \u201cfrustration-free setup\u201d initiative that Amazon announced last year, which stored user\u2019s Wi-Fi details to share them with compatible smart home devices.\n\nAmazon says that any device that carries this new certification will be designed to cut down the number of steps required to get them connected to Alexa. A developer page for the program lists further requirements for devices, which range from technical requirements like supporting automatic firmware updates, to another which says that certified devices must have a \u201chigh average customer review rating on Amazon.\u201d In total, the company says that certified devices have to meet over a dozen requirements to get certified.\n\n\u201cAlexa, discover devices\u201d\n\nA video shown on the Amazon\u2019s Certified for Humans page hints at how the new setup process works. It shows participants plugging in new smart home equipment and then asking Alexa to \u201cdiscover devices.\u201d After this, the devices appear to be fully functional \u2014 great if that\u2019s really all there is to it.\n\nAmazon isn\u2019t the only company to have tried to simplify the smart home setup process. The \u201cWorks with Apple HomeKit\u201d certification, for example, relies on you using your phone to scan a small QR code on new smart home gadgets in order to add it to Apple\u2019s Home app.\n\nAmazon says that it\u2019s already got a number of smart home products signed on to the new certification program, including Philips Hue smart lights, a Hamilton Beach coffee maker, and Kasa Smart-branded products by TP-Link. Naturally, Amazon says its own smart home devices, like the Echo Glow and Smart Oven will also be certified. The company says the certification should start appearing on devices \u201cthis fall.\u201d", "description": "In an attempt to make the smart home simpler, smarter, and safer, Amazon is announcing a new \"Certified for Humans\" program.
