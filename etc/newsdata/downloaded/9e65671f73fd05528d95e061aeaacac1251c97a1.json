Robbie is a very skilful fighter, but I'm happy to go 12 rounds, and show my skills, or if the opportunity arises, take the finish,\" Ritson told Telegraph Sport.", "description": "The last time Lewis Ritson fought in front of a fervent Geordie sell-out crowd in Newcastle as the headliner, it was a huge wake-up call for the powerful lightweight, who went on to lose his first professional fight, and his European lightweight title, to Francisco Patera.", "authors": ["Gareth A Davies", "Boxing Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/boxing/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000213298098-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwXc07GIJFq8ScykUqe-KfIM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
