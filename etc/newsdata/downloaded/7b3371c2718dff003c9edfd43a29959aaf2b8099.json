But, many of the biggest colleges and universities in the US aren't on the list. Some cities, like Savannah, Georgia, and Durham, North Carolina are relatively small cities, but have fairly expensive universities.\n\nFor example, Duke University in Durham has a cost of attendance over $78,000 per year and a relatively small student population of 15,890 students. Durham residents have the highest average student loan debt in the US, according to Experian's data.\n\nTo find this data, Experian looked at samples from its consumer credit database based on data from the first quarter of 2019. Experian defined metro areas based on census data, and calculated the average debt for a borrower in each city through its data.\n\nHere are the 21 cities where people have the most student loan debt in the US, along with the most prominent school nearby:", "description": "The cities with the most student debt aren't big cities like New York and Los Angeles \u2014 they're mostly college towns.", "authors": ["Liz Knueven"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9b56ed9386bc338a6e68ea?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
