Raul Ruiz\n\nVoters in California\u2019s 36th Congressional District have a novel opportunity: They could switch their representative without the bother of having to learn a new name.\n\nRep. Raul Ruiz wrested his inland California district from a Republican in 2012 and has coasted to double-digit victories the past two elections. But a new Republican challenger could create some unusual trouble for the incumbent Democrat.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHis name is Raul Ruiz.\n\nIf Republicans wanted to recruit someone with immediate name identification, it doesn't get any better than this.\n\nIn one corner, we have Rep. Raul Ruiz, a 47-year-old doctor who has solidified his grip on his seat over the better part of a decade in Congress. In the years since winning office, he\u2019s carved out a left-of-center path, supporting party tenets like Obamacare while eschewing progressive banner issues like single-payer health care.\n\nIn the other, we have the Republican hopeful Raul Ruiz, a 57-year-old construction contractor who abandoned a local government run ahead of the 2018 election and is using his campaign website to assail \u201cAOC and the radical liberals want to use handouts to keep people dependent on the government.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to give the citizens another option,\u201d the GOP Ruiz said in an interview with POLITICO, arguing that the elected Ruiz has a scant record of policy accomplishments during his time in Congress.\n\n\u201cObviously, that\u2019s going to create some confusion \u2014 to whose benefit or regret I don\u2019t know,\u201d he added of the identical names.\n\nWhile the incumbent Ruiz has formerly faced challenges from Republican elected officials, the Republican Ruiz is a political neophyte: He was a candidate for City Council in Perris last cycle, but withdrew before the election after learning he didn\u2019t meet the residency requirements.\n\nWhat he lacks in political experience, he said he makes up for in life experience. \u201cI\u2019ll say this,\u201d he said. \u201cI had the name first.\u201d\n\nRuiz the Democrat also comes from an incumbent\u2019s position of strength. His campaign committee had about $2 million stashed away as of late June, and Democrats retain a 7-point registration edge in his district. He has benefited from a more Democrat-friendly map drawn by a state commission in the last redistricting process.\n\nThe Democratic advantage in the district makes it unlikely the nomenclatural redundancy will swing the ultimate outcome, said Mindy Romero, who runs the California Civic Engagement Project at the University of Southern California.\n\nBut Romero said the second Ruiz\u2019s presence should have the effect of forcing the incumbent Ruiz to work harder to educate voters \u2014 particularly the low-information voters who use \u201cshortcuts\u201d when casting ballots.\n\n\u201cThe incumbent will want to educate folks who are using those shortcuts to look for the Democrat, look for the incumbent, don\u2019t just look for the name \u2014 be careful about who you pick,\u201d Romero said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time voters have had to contend with candidate double vision. Last cycle, there were two candidates named Ron Estes in Kansas. In 2001, voters in the California city of South Gate had to choose whether they wanted to be represented by Hector De La Torre or Hector De La Torre.", "description": "If Republicans wanted to recruit someone with immediate name identification, it doesn't get any better than this.", "authors": ["Jeremy B.
