If I could have written the script for my last season at Wigan there\u2019s no doubt I would have included chapters about Challenge Cup and Grand Final glory.\n\nTo score a last-minute try at Wembley and then turn around such a big margin at Old Trafford to beat Warrington was unbelievable. Needless to say we celebrated in style.\n\nScroll down to watch Rooney's good luck message and Sam's training tips\n\n\n\nWarming up: Sam Tomkins is looking forward to the World Cup opener against Australia on Saturday In with a shout: Tomkins says England can beat the favourites, who will have the likes of Greg Inglis (below)\n\nDomestic glory: Tomkins has won the Grand Final (left with the trophy and team-mate Pat Richards) and the Challenge Cup with Wigan this season\n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t have long to relax, though, before I knew it I was on the plane to South Africa for a training camp with the rest of the England boys who had played in the Grand Final where we met the rest of the squad. They\u2019d been out there a week early working very hard.\n\nThe spirit in the camp was great when we arrived and remained the same throughout. Training was extremely intense, lots of heavy weights and lots of drills.\n\nAnd of course the much talked about Burgess Boys joined us from Australia. God they are big, especially George and Tom. They are top lads and we are lucky to have them in our squad. I can\u2019t wait to see the impact they make in the World Cup.\n\n\n\nSam is one of our best players and it\u2019s been too long since he last played for England. I know he\u2019s desperate to get started now.\n\nI was rooming with my Wigan team-mate Josh Charnley. He\u2019s one of my closest friends and we used to share for away games with Wigan. We have a good system; he does my washing and ironing.\n\nAs you can imagine with 24 lads there was plenty of banter flying around when we aren\u2019t training. The guys from Wigan, including me, took great delight in winding Warrington\u2019s Ben Westwood up after his punch on Blake Green in the Grand Final.\n\n\n\nIt was all in good jest but for the first three days we thought we\u2019d ignore him. He\u2019s a great guy and a fantastic professional and took the joke very well. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll get his own back over the next few weeks at some point.\n\nThe trip to South Africa was a great learning and bonding experience for the team.\n\nThere are only a few days to go before we take on Australia at the Millennium Stadium. I\u2019m incredibly excited by the prospect of walking out in front of a big crowd and singing the national anthem.\n\n\n\nPlaying Australia is the pinnacle of our sport and we want to get our campaign off to a winning start \u2013 and we are confident we can do that.\n\nTOMKINS ON TWITTER\n\nFollow Sam on Twitter @samtomkins1\n\nI hear that Martin Offiah and Gethin Jones will be dancing with their Strictly Come Dancing partners.\n\n\n\nGood luck to them, that\u2019s all I can say about that, you won\u2019t find me getting my dancing shoes on when I retire.\n\nJoking aside, it promises to be a great show and I urge the fans of the four teams competing on Saturday to come and support us.\n\nAt some point in the competition we may come across New Zealand and the freakish talent that is Sonny Bill Williams. It\u2019s great news for the tournament that he\u2019s decided he wants to play.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s one of the biggest names, if not the biggest, in our sport. As players we want to test ourselves against the very best and he definitely is that.\n\nMy brother Joel was selected in England\u2019s squad for the upcoming Autumn Internationals this week.\n\n\n\nFor Joel and I to both be playing at the top of our sports is unbelievable \u2013 our family are very proud.\n\nJoel\u2019s such a talent and has worked so hard on his game since his move to Saracens.\n\n\n\nThe transition from league to union isn\u2019t an easy one but he\u2019s handled it fantastically well and I\u2019ve got no doubt he will hit the ground running and can go on and prosper on the international stage.", "description": "There are only a few days to go before we take on Australia at the Millennium Stadium.
