As many as six people have already died of severe respiratory illness brought on by use of e-cigarettes. On Wednesday President Trump announced a Food and Drug Administration ban on many flavored vaping products citing safety concerns, calling it \u201ca new problem.\u201d\n\nBut while critics of e-cigarettes have seized upon recent tragedies to demand further regulatory restrictions, policy makers should ask whether their efforts to squash legitimate e-cigarette manufacturers have enabled counterfeiters and black-market vendors. From early reports, most of the vaping-related illnesses appear to be linked to unregulated home-brews and street concoctions of e-liquids.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FDA and the state and local health departments that are investigating the recent deaths report that many of those sickened by vaping admit to having used products with liquids containing marijuana extracts such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD). Online videos showing consumers how to make their own vape cartridges with infused cannabis oil, which can be cooked up at home or purchased at marijuana dispensaries, have been viewed millions of times.\n\nLast week 34 people in New York were reported to have suffered from respiratory illnesses linked to vaping, but investigators found vitamin E acetate in the vast majority of samples they analyzed. This substance is often used as a thickening agent for THC-infused extracts added to vape cartridges. None of these cases involved a nicotine product subject to the new FDA ban.\n\nIn fact, most if not all of the recent spate of hospitalizations nationwide due to vaping have been associated with marijuana oil. We aren\u2019t aware of a single case in the whole country that has been associated with nicotine-only e-cigarettes, never mind flavored nicotine products.\n\nAs state and federal regulators have made it harder for legitimate manufacturers to market their products, some e-cigarette users are turning to counterfeits. High taxes and restrictions on flavors have created a potentially dangerous black market.\n\nSince the FDA began pressuring Juul Labs, the largest e-cigarette manufacturer in the U.S., to stop selling flavored e-liquids, counterfeits with unknown ingredients and unknown quality standards have proliferated. Modified e-cigarette products from black-market sources have been found to contain harmful contaminants and substandard ingredients. Some companies have even been caught selling e-cigarette cartridges containing weight-loss and erectile-dysfunction medication. As with prescription medications, counterfeits can kill.\n\nThe draconian regulatory approach to e-cigarettes may also discourage combustible cigarette smokers from switching to vaping. That will cost lives too.\n\nAccording to the CDC, smoking is the leading cause of preventable death. Nicotine e-cigarettes may be as much as 95% safer than combustible cigarettes, and research is increasingly demonstrating that vaping can be an effective way to get smokers to quit\u2014almost twice as effective as FDA-approved nicotine-replacement therapies, according to one recent study. Of course, while vaping is safer than smoking regular cigarettes, inhaling anything other than air can never be totally safe and shouldn\u2019t be treated as if it were.\n\nStill, there are signs that e-cigarettes on net have saved lives by offering a safer alternative to smoking. As vaping\u2019s popularity has grown over the last five years, smoking rates have plunged to historic lows. As recently as 1997, 36.4% of U.S. high-school students claimed to have tried cigarettes. By 2017 the high-school smoking rate had fallen to 7.6%.\n\nPolicy makers have missed opportunities to use e-cigarettes to mitigate tobacco-related harm. In the last few months San Francisco has passed an outright ban on e-cigarettes, Michigan has prohibited the sale of flavored e-liquids, and Maine more than doubled its tobacco tax\u2014which applies to vaping products as well as to cigarettes, cigars and pipe tobacco\u2014to 43% from 20%.\n\nAt the White House Wednesday, President Trump cited the popularity of vaping among teenagers as a chief reason for the ban on flavored e-cigarette products. He is right to be concerned. U.S. manufacturers have set the minimum age for buying e-cigarettes at 21, and more enforcement is absolutely needed, including spot checks. Stores that continue to market and sell e-cigarettes and other vaping products to underage customers should be heavily fined or shut down.\n\nThere are other ways to combat teenage vaping. One manufacturer is now selling a Bluetooth device in Canada and the United Kingdom that would allow parents to turn off a vape pen, ensuring that it couldn\u2019t be used by children at home. Unfortunately, it could take seven to 10 years for the FDA to approve this device for the U.S.\n\nPublic health officials should thoroughly investigate the roots of the continuing lung-disease outbreak. But before pinning the blame on legitimate e-cigarette manufacturers\u2014and before banning their products\u2014lawmakers should examine how their own heavy-handed approach is contributing to this \u201cnew problem.\u201d\n\nMessrs.
