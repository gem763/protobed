Add Interest\n\nI first told a friend when I was 16 that I thought I could be gay.\n\nI remember I cried and cried at her parent\u2019s kitchen table -- afraid that they would hear from the room next door.\n\nI think I cried from relief, but also sadness that I wasn\u2019t like everyone else.\n\nComing out for me felt like admitting a crime -- hoping that my friend wouldn\u2019t judge me.\n\nIt was only her love and kindness that made me realize otherwise.\n\nWhat followed was eight years of slowly telling more and more people, until I finally wrote my mother an email (I know!) when I was 24.\n\nThat first friend has remained one of my closest. I was so proud to give the reading at her wedding last year.\n\nOne of the funnier coming out moments was when I told a very good girlfriend at university ... and she was the one who cried!\n\nWe sat on my bed in my London flat, and between great, hysterical hiccups with tears streaming down her face, she managed to say, \"Oh James, I don\u2019t know -- it\u2019s just, I feel like an option for me has gone off the table!\u201d\n\nCharming.\n\nGod, how we laughed.\n\nFor me, every interaction I had before I came out was essentially a lie.\n\nThat sounds dramatic, but I can\u2019t describe it any other way.\n\nWhether talking about relationships, or buying milk, I just didn\u2019t feel myself, and wasn\u2019t presenting my real self to the world. So it made me feel like less of a person.\n\nThat\u2019s part of why I think I dealt with depression in my early twenties -- and why I think so many young gay men and women do today. Feeling that you are \"less\" than other people -- that you are essentially worthless -- is an obvious route to a mental health crisis.\n\nI could never imagine then the life I have now.\n\n\"But James, are you ever scared going to places where it\u2019s not OK to be gay?\"\n\nThat\u2019s the question I get most on social media, and elsewhere.\n\nThe truth is: sometimes.\n\nBeing in Chechnya recently, where we were looking into abuses of LGBTQ people, is a good example of feeling slightly on edge -- to put it mildly!\n\nBut when I\u2019m on a story, I\u2019m conscious of three audiences: the people I\u2019m with in that place; the broader TV audience at home; and the young gay men and women who may see my work.\n\nThe first group can be challenging.\n\nI\u2019m keen to be myself, but also sensitive to different attitudes in places where gay rights have a ways to go.\n\nWhilst not legitimizing homophobic views, you just have to be practical in how you deal with certain situations.\n\nIf anyone I meet in some far-off place decided to Google me, they\u2019d see I\u2019m gay (shoutout to my pretty incredible -- and very patient -- boyfriend Alex!).\n\nSo the very act of being there and interacting with them becomes powerful in and of itself.\n\nPerhaps on some level I hope that by meeting me, and seeing that I take an interest in their lives, they may be less judgmental of mine.\n\nThe audience at home is the second group -- and I\u2019m aware there are also anti-gay views there. If in doing my job I break some negative stereotypes, and they too can change their perceptions, then that is a happy outcome.\n\nI\u2019m powerfully aware though of the third audience: young gay men and women who may be struggling with their identity.\n\nWhen I was growing up, I had virtually no one to look to in the public eye, where I could say to myself, \"Wow, he managed it, I might not have to be in the dark forever.\"\n\nSo if you\u2019re reading this, wherever you are, know that your experience, as unique as it may feel now, has been shared by millions through time.\n\nSome have had it worse, others have had it easier.\n\nBut there is a community waiting for you, with love and understanding.\n\nYou\u2019ll feel as though your life has only just begun.\n\nEach of you who makes that brave step makes it possible that in the future, the next 16-year-old boy with really bad skin, who wore fleece way too much, would be proud of himself, rather than ashamed.\n\nNo more crying in the kitchen, it\u2019s time to go out into the sunshine.\n\nJames Longman is a foreign correspondent for ABC News based in the London bureau.", "description": "ABC News' James Longman reflects on his life and experiences on National Coming Out Day.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/longman-comingout-splt-aa-191010_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
