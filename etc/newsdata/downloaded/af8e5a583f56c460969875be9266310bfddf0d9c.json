The truth is, though, that when they come to do their job, they don\u2019t see colour.\n\n\u2018They just see a BBC News person implying the president of America is racist.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \u2018There may be only a few hundred people in the country who think Munchetty is wrong.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018But it is not the BBC\u2019s job to ignore them or their views, abhorrent though they may be.\u2019\n\nBack in July, Munchetty called out the US president after a series of tweets in response to four Democratic congresswomen who were outspoken about his immigration policies.\n\nResponding to the tweets which called for the women to \u2018go back\u2019 to the \u2018places from which they came\u2019, Naga recalled her own experiences of being told to \u2018go home\u2019 in the UK.\n\n\u2018Everytime I\u2019ve been told as a woman of colour to \u201cgo home\u201d, to \u201cgo back to where I\u2019ve come from\u201d, that was embedded in racism,\u2019 Naga said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Now I\u2019m not accusing anyone of anything here but you know what certain phrases mean.\u2019\n\nThe BBC\u2019s Executive Complaints Unit (ECU) ruled the comments \u2018went beyond what the guidelines allow for\u2019 in regards to impartiality, only for the decision to be overturned five days later.\n\nIn a message to BBC staff on the topic, Hall wrote: \u2018It was only ever in a limited way that there was found to be a breach of our guidelines. These are often finely balanced and difficult judgements.\n\n\u2018But, in this instance, I don\u2019t think Naga\u2019s words were sufficient enough to merit a partial uphold of the complaint around the comments she made.\n\n\u2018There was never any sanction against Naga and I hope this step makes that absolutely clear. She is an exceptional journalist and presenter and I am proud that she works for the BBC.\u2019\n\nClarkson\u2019s relationship with the BBC famously fell apart after he punched a crew member of Top Gear while filming, in a row over food.\n\nMORE: Jeremy Clarkson officially launches new Amazon Prime series and it\u2019s a million miles away from The Grand Tour\n\nMORE: Jeremy Clarkson scoffs at Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? player over epic fail: \u2018You just said that on national TV!\u2019", "description": "Jeremy Clarkson has criticised the BBC after its decision to overturn the ruling against Naga Munchetty.", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88993817_1570542732.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
