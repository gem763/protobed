When a harmless organism mimics a noxious, or dangerous, organism to gain protection from predators. The predators mistake it for the dangerous organism it is impersonating and leave it alone. This form of mimicry is named after its the 19th-century English naturalist Henry Walter Bates for his work on butterflies in the rainforests of Brazil. Bates recognised that some species of butterflies appeared superficially similar to others despite being unrelated. He suggested the resemblance was due to the anti-predator adaption (mimicking).\n\nDr Svenson said: 'Typically, the majority of species differentiation is discovered and confirmed within a lab or collection setting.\n\n'To have that rare eureka moment where you know you have found something new in the field is incredibly exciting.'\n\nHe said the obvious colouring and erratic behaviour is the mantis 'advertising' itself as potentially dangerous to its predators.\n\nHe added: 'When you are a species that can be easily taken as prey, you advertise because you want predators to think that you are poisonous, or could injure them, or any combination of unpleasant factors that tell the predator to think twice before pursuing you.'\n\nMost mantises opt to imitate a rather easier character \u2013 a leaf or other vegetation \u2013 to escape capture.\n\nWasp mimicry in adults is unique, and limited to just one family, of which Vespamantoida is now a part.\n\nAs a new species it will join one other recently recognised species within a new genus called Vespamantoida.\n\nDr Svenson believes there are around 5,000 different species of wasp in the wild, double the 2,500 species of mantises recorded.\n\nMost mantis opt to imitate a rather easier character - a leaf or other vegetation. Wasp mimicry in adults is unique\n\nHe added: 'I think the most interesting thing about this family of mantises is the fact that most of the adults do mimic wasps, and that is quite unique for praying mantises.\n\n'I think the next natural thing is to study the evolutionary biology of the lineage.\n\n'If wasp mimicry is successful in this lineage, why has it not evolved in the other lineages as well?\n\n'Why have no other species within the family evolved brightly colored wasp mimicry? We're just not sure.'\n\nThe results of the team's findings were published today in the online journal PeerJ.", "description": "Researchers at Cleveland Museum of Natural History have discovered a new species of praying mantis, described as the first known mantis species to mimic a wasp to try and evade its predators.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/15/19887716-0-image-a-41_1571410239932.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
