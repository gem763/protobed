But there are still many specific facts we do not know about how that murder took place, including what happened to the body.\n\nAccording to a report on the killing by U.N. Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard released in June, after Khashoggi\u2019s death, men carrying \u201cwhat seem like plastic trash bags\u201d and at least one suitcase exited the consulate.\n\nShortly after the men carrying these bags were seen exiting, an apparent body double was seen leaving the consulate in Khashoggi\u2019s clothes and walking around Istanbul. The ruse was quickly foiled when observers quickly spotted that the man was wearing different shoes than the Saudi journalist.\n\nAD\n\nReports citing Turkish intelligence officials suggest Khashoggi\u2019s body parts may have been taken to the Saudi consul\u2019s home nearby, where they could have been burned in a furnace. Another line of investigation Turkish authorities pursued was that Khashoggi\u2019s remains were dissolved in acid and disposed in a well on the consulate grounds.\n\nAD\n\nNeither theory about the fate of Khashoggi\u2019s body has been confirmed by Turkish or Saudi authorities.\n\nWhat happened to Saud al-Qahtani?\n\nSaud al-Qahtani was known to be a close ally of the Saudi prince, serving as a media adviser to the royal court. In addition to that job, Qahtani played a more nebulous role in which he created a \u201cblacklist\u201d of online critics of Saudi Arabia.\n\nAD\n\nIn the months before he disappeared, Khashoggi had told friends he had received calls from Qahtani urging him to come home to Riyadh. After Khashoggi was killed, Qahtani mocked the Turkish investigation into the journalist\u2019s killing and denied any role in the it.\n\nHowever, when Saudi Arabia finally admitted involvement in the killing, it said it had fired five top officials and arrested 18 other Saudis as a result of the initial investigation. Qahtani was among those fired. The next month, prosecutors said he was under investigation and forbidden from leaving the country.\n\nAD\n\nSince then, little has been heard of Qahtani. He has not been seen in the Saudi court case into the killing of Khashoggi, and diplomats said he has not been charged. Some reports claimed he was spotted away from home in Jiddah, while others said he remained under house arrest. Speculation grew that he had died; even his Twitter account was suspended.\n\nAD\n\nCould the crown prince not have known?\n\nIn interviews with U.S. media outlets around the anniversary of Khashoggi\u2019s death, Mohammed has denied any involvement or foreknowledge of the killing but said he takes responsibility for the death, as it ultimately took place under his watch.\n\n\u201cIf there is any such information that charges me, I hope it is brought forward publicly,\u201d he told interviewer Norah O\u2019Donnell of CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\n\nA CIA assessment made shortly after Khashoggi\u2019s death concluded with \u201chigh confidence\u201d that Mohammed had ordered the assassination, citing a variety of evidence including a phone call the prince\u2019s brother Khalid bin Salman, at the time the Saudi ambassador to the United States, had with Khashoggi.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMoreover, the crown prince, the preeminent political power in the kingdom, is known as a micromanager, and many analysts have argued he would not have allowed such a sensitive operation to go ahead without his personal approval.\n\n\u201cDo you think I can act by myself without taking orders/guidance?\u201d Qahtani said in a tweet from 2017 that was widely shared after Khashoggi\u2019s death as evidence Mohammed maintained strict control over Qahtani\u2019s efforts to silence dissidents. \u201cI am an employee and a trustworthy executive to the orders of the king and the crown prince.\u201d\n\nHas Saudi Arabia ended its policy of targeting overseas dissidents?\n\nKhashoggi was just one critic of Mohammed who had left Saudi Arabia who found himself facing the wrath of the Saudi state.\n\nAD\n\nThere are numerous accounts of dissidents who fled abroad who have been targeted, whether they were tribal sheikhs who were forcibly returned from Jordan, young activists who faced threats and surveillance in Canada, or even Saudi princes who clashed with those who held power.\n\nAD\n\nThough efforts to silence critics of the Saudi kingdom stretch back decades, they appear to have intensified under Mohammed. In recent years, dissidents had found themselves targeted all over the world, with Saudi agents working covertly or co-opting the local government. In a number of cases, those targeted disappeared from the public eye.\n\nThe Saudi government has insisted Khashoggi\u2019s killing was a tragic mistake and has pledged to restructure its intelligence services, but the kingdom has not been clear about whether it will end efforts to target and intimidate critics who have fled to other countries.\n\nAD\n\nWhat is the fate of Khashoggi\u2019s family?\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s children \u2014 two sons and two daughters \u2014 have generally kept a low profile in the year since the killing and have refrained from openly criticizing the kingdom.\n\nAD\n\nSalah, the oldest son, even met with the crown prince and King Salman shortly after his father\u2019s murder. He later told CNN the king had assured him \u201ceverybody involved will be brought to justice\u201d for the killing and that he had faith it would happen.\n\nThe Post reported in April that Khashoggi\u2019s children have received million-dollar houses in the kingdom and monthly five-figure payments as compensation for the killing of their father and that they may receive much larger payouts when the trial is completed.\n\nAD\n\nBut some friends of Khashoggi have suggested Salah, the only child who lives in the country, may have been banned from leaving Saudi Arabia.\n\nWill there be a full international investigation into the killing?\n\nSince January, 11 officials have been on trial in Saudi Arabia for their alleged role in the killing of Khashoggi.\n\nAD\n\nHowever, the trial takes place behind closed doors. Saudi Arabia has not named the defendants, and the trial is closed to the media. It is unclear what the status of the trial is or even how many trial sessions have taken place.\n\nU.N. Special Rapporteur Callamard found herself stonewalled by Saudi officials. Though she said she never found a \u201csmoking gun\u201d linking the crown prince to the killing, she has called for a freeze on the prince\u2019s assets and that sanctions be imposed against him until he is either cleared or definitively implicated.\n\nSaudi Arabia has resisted any effort to launch an international probe.\n\nHas the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia actually changed?\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s killing led to bipartisan calls for action from the U.S. Senate, with even longtime supporters of the kingdom such as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) suggesting sanctions be imposed against Saudi Arabia.\n\nAD\n\nAmong the public, the murder appears to have damaged Saudi Arabia\u2019s already negative reputation further, according to recent polls.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration has appeared unwilling to sideline a longtime \u2014 and lucrative \u2014 ally. The crown prince has maintained a friendly relationship with Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in addition to the president himself.\n\nIn April, the president vetoed a bipartisan resolution to force an end to U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen. At the Group of 20 gathering of world leaders in Osaka, Japan, in June, Trump happily stood next to Mohammed for the so-called family photo of world leaders.\n\nThe White House has restricted access to transcripts of the president\u2019s calls with the crown prince and his father, CNN reported last week.", "description": "The killing of the Saudi journalist shook the world 12 months ago, but in many ways, the circumstances of the case remain clouded in uncertainty.", "authors": ["Adam Taylor", "Foreign Reporter Who Writes About A Variety Of Subjects"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3P3LWuI5FLjrZCuAP8vqcoC8SlA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WVGQ2TG4ZQI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg"}
