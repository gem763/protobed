The Food and Drug Administration said this month that it wasn\u2019t informed about the data manipulation until after it approved use of the drug May 24.\n\nFDA officials, who subsequently inspected the company\u2019s control testing lab in San Diego, noted that Novartis became aware of the problem March 14, but didn\u2019t open a formal probe until two months later, with no explanation for the gap.\n\n\u201cThere is no documentation,\u201d FDA investigators Scott T. Ballard and Mihaly S. Ligmond wrote in their Aug. 2 report, as to why the probe \u201cwas not opened until 15 May, 2019, when the initial allegation is documented as having been reported on 14 March 2019.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to The Wall Street Journal, Novartis said that during those two months, it \u201cconducted an independent investigation with the support of external counsel to determine the extent of data discrepancies and whether they could be explained.\u201d\n\nNovartis said the internal probe had to be conducted in a \u201cvery confidential manner\u201d so that senior executives at AveXis\u2014its Illinois-based unit that produced the drug\u2014wouldn\u2019t attempt to interfere. The company also said it plans to file a full written explanation of the gap to the FDA as early as this week.\n\nIn its statement, the company said that the investigation it formally launched in May was a \u201cfull technical quality investigation by our quality organization\u2026requiring significant time and resources, and the extensive review of physical and electronic documents, test data and laboratory notes.\u201d\n\nNovartis, in a report filed with the FDA about the data issue, said it began a formal investigation May 8.\n\nNovartis announced last week that it had replaced two research executives at AveXis who led the research into the medicine, chief scientific officer Brian Kaspar and research chief Allan Kaspar. Allan Kaspar couldn\u2019t be reached. John Hueston, an attorney for his brother Brian Kaspar, said \u201che has cooperated in the internal investigation and categorically denies any wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nIn interviews, FDA officials said that two months to open an investigation seems excessive, especially when FDA action on a major drug was pending. They said the agency should have been notified as soon as the company suspected data manipulation, and that the data problems, had they been known, could have delayed approval.\n\nThe FDA, in an official statement Thursday, said, \u201cWhile in some instances it may be reasonable for a firm to make a determination of the merit of a complaint in order to decide whether or not to initiate an investigation, each decision must be considered on a case-by-case basis. We are not able to comment specifically on the circumstances of this case.\u201d\n\nIn a Twitter message Aug. 6, FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless said agency officials \u201crely on truthful scientific data to make regulatory decisions, and we take the issue of data integrity very seriously.\u201d The FDA, he said, \u201cwill use its full authorities to take action, if appropriate, which may include civil or criminal penalties.\u201d\n\nThe data manipulation occurred in animal tests accompanying human clinical testing and involved giving various strengths of Zolgensma to mice to measure how long they lived. This was a small part of the overall testing.\n\nBoth the company and the federal agency said that the data manipulation, if known, wouldn\u2019t have affected the final decision on Zolgensma, which is considered the world\u2019s most expensive drug.\n\nWrite to Thomas M.
