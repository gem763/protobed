(AP Photo/Cliff Owen)\n\nThe release of last week\u2019s Inspector General\u2019s report, which focused on James Comey, was a disappointment to conservatives who were hoping to see the former FBI Director held accountable for his actions. DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz found that Comey had flouted FBI rules and ignored protocol in his determination to undermine President-elect Trump. He leaked memos he had written after each meeting with Trump with the intention of triggering the appointment of a special counsel. And he was successful. Horowitz clearly presented Comey\u2019s wrongdoing, but even so, Attorney General William Barr declined to charge him with a crime.\n\nThere were several reasons for Barr\u2019s decision. Comey, having attained the top position at the FBI knew the limitations of the law and how to remain within them. First, he made sure his memos were not classified at the time he leaked them. Next, he leaked the documents to his attorney friend who also had a security clearance.\n\nFinally, he employed a legal tool that only an experienced trial lawyer would be familiar with. The National Review\u2019s Andrew McCarthy, who is a former US attorney himself, immediately recognized it and explained how Comey used what prosecutors call a \u201crecollection recorded.\u201d\n\nAt a certain (prearranged) moment during the intelligence briefing of President-elect Trump on January 6, 2016, the other officials, including CIA director John Brennan, left Comey and Trump alone so that Comey could \u201cspring the trap.\u201d\n\nComey told Trump of the dossier and specifically discussed the \u201cgolden showers\u201d story. McCarthy writes that he was trying to force Trump into making incriminating statements that he could include in his memo of the meeting, and which could later be used as a \u201crecollection recorded.\u201d This is what Comey wrote in his memo following the meeting.\n\nI said, the Russians allegedly had tapes involving him and prostitutes at the Presidential Suite at the Ritz Carlton in Moscow from about 2013. He interjected, \u201cthere were no prostitutes; there were never prostitutes.\u201d He then said something about him being the kind of guy who didn\u2019t need to \u201cgo there\u201d and laughed (which I understood to be communicating that he didn\u2019t need to pay for sex). He said \u201c2013\u201d to himself, as if trying to remember that period of time, but didn\u2019t add anything. He said he always assumed that hotel rooms he stayed in when he travels are wired in some way.\n\nMcCarthy explains what Comey was trying to accomplish:\n\nIf you understand what Comey was doing, the memo is not very subtle. The implication is that the \u201cgolden showers\u201d incident may well have happened (meaning: Yes, Putin may have Trump over a barrel, just like Chris Steele says!). The president-elect was adamant only that prostitutes were not involved, not that an escapade of this kind was inconceivable. That is to say: If the FBI\u2019s investigation turned up some corroboration for Steele\u2019s pee-tape story, Comey would now be in a position to provide helpful testimony about Trump\u2019s statements and state of mind. The memo itself might even be admissible in court as evidence for the prosecution. In June 2017, when the existence of former director Comey\u2019s memos first emerged, he was asked why he\u2019d made them. He [Comey] explained, \u201cI understood this to be my recollection recorded of my conversation with the president.\u201d I [McCarthy] observed at the time that, as an old prosecutor, that got my antennae pinging. To non-attorneys, this was just gobbledygook. But as any trial lawyer can tell you, \u201crecollection recorded\u201d is not an idle phrase. It is a term of art in the Federal Rules of Evidence (specifically, Rule 803(5), \u201cRecorded Recollection\u201d). Most out-of-court statements (e.g., a news story about an event) are inadmissible as hearsay. But under some circumstances, \u201crecollection recorded\u201d is an exception to the hearsay rule. To qualify, the recollection must be recorded (such as in a memo) at the time an incident was fresh in the witness\u2019s memory, so that it accurately reflects the witness\u2019s knowledge. That\u2019s why \u2014 if you\u2019re not only an FBI official but a seasoned trial lawyer, such as Jim Comey \u2014 you\u2019d want to write it down contemporaneously or immediately after the relevant event. Perhaps in a car speeding to a meeting with fellow investigators to report back to them about the investigation you\u2019ve just done, despite telling your prime suspect, the incoming president, that you are not investigating him.\n\nBarr is not a stupid man and knew that, due to Comey\u2019s careful preparation and deliberate manipulation of the President-elect, it would be difficult to prosecute a case against him.\n\nBarr is also well aware that there are two far more comprehensive reports coming. The first, the IG\u2019s report on the FBI\u2019s abuse of the FISA Court application process is due at the end of this month or in early October. The American Spectator\u2019s Jed Babbin wrote that these reports are expected to show clear violations of the law. \u201cNot in violation of regulations or procedures: in violation of the law.\u201d\n\nAnd, from what sources such as former DOJ official Joe DiGenova, investigative reporter John Solomon and several GOP members of Congress have said, the findings will be very damaging to James Comey and his colleagues.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) appeared on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d last weekend and predicted that the IG\u2019s FISA abuse report would be \u201cdevastating\u201d and will result in indictments. Biggs, who is a member of the House Judiciary Committee said:\n\nI anticipate that we will see some very stark revelations of manipulation of the whole system for political purposes. When you see that happen, that\u2019s when I think you\u2019re going to see references or referrals for indictments, and I think you are going to see some indictments. I think you are going to see some accountability there.\n\nBiggs estimated that the report \u201cwill be released probably mid-September.\u201d\n\nComey signed off on the original FISA Court application and two of the three renewals for the warrant to spy on low-level Trump campaign advisor Carter Page for the purpose of spying on Trump. The FBI knowingly used Christopher Steele\u2019s unverified dossier as the basis of their FISA applications. Comey, as well as the other major players in the conspiracy to bring down Trump knew the dossier was bogus, but wanted to gain a window into his campaign. FBI officials had been warned by the fourth highest ranking DOJ official, Bruce Ohr, that the dossier was funded by the Clinton campaign and the DNC and that Steele had been hired by opposition research firm Fusion GPS. They were told that Steele harbored deep resentment against Donald Trump and was \u201cdesperate\u201d that he lose the race.\n\nIn addition, the FBI had received an email from State Department official Kathleen Kavalec prior to submitting their first application to the FISA Court.\n\nFinally, The Hill\u2019s John Solomon reported that the FBI kept a chart of the allegations made in the dossier. And the finest law enforcement agency in the world with all of the powerful tools of intelligence available to them, had not been able to verify a single one.\n\nThree months after signing off on the first application swearing that the information had been \u201cverified,\u201d Comey sat in Trump\u2019s office and grossly misrepresented the situation for his own purposes.\n\nThe case against Comey and his top officials is pretty clear cut in this instance and there is a solid trail of evidence to back it up. This leaves very little opportunity for deception.\n\nThe second and most consequential report will come after special prosecutor John Durham completes his investigation into the origins of the Trump/Russia collusion case.\n\nThat report will be the \u201cmain event.\u201d Babbin writes that, \u201cIt will be the one that decides whom to indict and will obtain those indictments from one or more grand juries convened for that purpose.\u201d (I will focus on that report in a later post.)", "description": "Why Comey Escaped Charges Last Week and Why His Luck Is Likely To Change", "authors": ["Elizabeth Vaughn", "Alex Parker", "Kira Davis", "Brandon Morse", "Sarah Lee", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ap-comey-eyes-closed.jpg"}
