The AER's decision is provisional, with a final call due on April 30, 2020.\n\nThe decision provided for a weighted average cost of capital of 4.95 per cent, which incorporates a regulated equity return of 4.98 per cent. Spark insisted this was insufficient not just for its own network, but for all electricity networks.\n\nSpark managing director Rick Francis said it was \"disappointing\" that the AER had \"not acted on the clear message it has received from the investment community in relation to the market\u2019s rate of return expectations\".\n\n\"In our view, the rate of return is insufficient to ensure the long-term sustainability and reliability of Australia\u2019s electricity infrastructure,\" he said.", "description": "Spark says it will not be able to invest sufficiently in its electricity networks after the energy regulator knocked back its revenue request.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.299%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_107/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b88fa41dbb86a63a7edfef02c624c889f3ed6438", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
