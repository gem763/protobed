Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s support for confiscating Americans\u2019 firearms doesn\u2019t appear to have helped buoy the Texas Democrat\u2019s presidential campaign, according to a poll published Tuesday.\n\nO\u2019Rourke struggled to maintain 2% of the vote in a Wall Street Journal poll conducted Sept. 13-16 of 506 Democratic primary voters. His numbers didn\u2019t change much since July, when the former lawmakers pulled in only 1% support.\n\nThe numbers come after the Sept. 12 Democratic debate in which O\u2019Rourke assured viewers that he would indeed make a play for semi-automatic rifles. \u201cHell yes we are going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d he said to applause from those who attended the debate in Houston.\n\nO\u2019Rourke began promoting the position in early September after another mass shooting in Texas left several dead in El Paso.\n\n\u201cI see us working with gun owners, non-gun owners, local, county, state, federal law enforcement to come up with the best possible solution. I have yet to meet an owner of an AR-15 who thinks it\u2019s OK that we have these kind of mass killings in this country,\u201d the 46-year-old told reporters in a Sept. 9 interview.\n\nTuesday\u2019s poll also showed a bump for former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running neck and neck with Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Biden leads the horserace with backing from 31% of Democratic primary voters, while Warren gets 25 percent.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "If that didn't work, what will?", "authors": ["Chris White"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZihTDQspsugDtlnj3Sk50A--~B/aD04OTM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/c90ab13a5ede03d6f7ec2d70cc20ca78", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
