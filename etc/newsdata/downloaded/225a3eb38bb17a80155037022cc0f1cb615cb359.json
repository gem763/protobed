You don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2014 and I will. I've already given you a little sample with respect to Pastor Brunson.\n\nI have worked hard to solve some of your problems. Don't let the world down. You can make a great deal. General Mazloum is willing to negotiate with you, and he is willing to make concessions that they would never have made in the past. I am confidentially enclosing a copy of his letter to me, just received.\n\nHistory will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool!\n\nI will call you later.", "description": "Trump said he\u2019d written the \u201cvery powerful\u201d letter to warn the Turkish leader.", "authors": ["The New York Times"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/us/white-house-trump-letter-promo-1571261887115/white-house-trump-letter-promo-1571261887115-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
