He dissected it in the field, removing the skin and some organs to prepare it to be added to his collection. Something caught his eye under the bird\u2019s pure white feathers: a muscular, sculpted chest. \u201cIt had a six pack,\u201d he said, with tissue five times thicker than that of most birds its size.\n\nCohn-Haft enlisted the help of Jeff Podos, an animal behaviour specialist at the University of Massachusetts and a co-author of the paper, to study the white bellbird. They suspected that the bird\u2019s muscular physique might explain its earsplitting song: the male sings an explosive two-toned cry.\n\nSquirrels listen to birds' chitchat to gauge if trouble's afoot \u2013 study Read more\n\nCohn-Haft and Podos returned to Roraima and crept up to within 40 metres (130ft) of white bellbirds singing from bare branches. They had brought a directional microphone and a precision audio recorder. In order to make accurate measurements, they had to make recordings with the birds facing them, with no intervening obstacles.\n\nThe scientists also had front row seats to watch the birds\u2019 bizarre courtship rituals. The female alights on a branch about a metre from the male, which promptly begins singing the louder of the two songs in its repertoire. Cohn-Haft said the male faces directly away from the potential mate for the first of the song\u2019s notes. Then, in a fraction of a second, he swivels around and yells the second note \u201cright in her face\u201d.\n\n\u201cShe knows it\u2019s coming,\u201d said Cohn-Haft, because just before the second note she flutters back a few metres. The male has a long black wattle hanging down from the top of his head that whips around when he turns his head. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t know any better she\u2019d get it in the face,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bird\u2019s song was recorded at 125dB, which Cohn-Haft and Podos say raises many questions. For starters, said Podos, \u201chow can they do this without going deaf?\u201d\n\nThe researchers suggested the unusual call may be the result of sexual selection. Cohn-Haft speculated that plentiful food in the bellbird\u2019s mountain habitat had allowed the species to become unhitched from strict obedience to the dictates of survival of the fittest.\n\n\u201cSurvival is easy enough, so these birds are free to develop traits that, whimsically or not, are attractive to each other.\u201d He said these traits had more in common with the \u201cbeauty\u201d of a song or a dance than utilitarian behaviours such as hunting or tools for fighting such as teeth and claws.\n\n\u201cThis is an example of sexual selection gone wild,\u201d said Podos.\n\nHe said there was no particular scientific benefit to identifying the most deafening birdsong, any more than there was to identifying the cheetah as the animal kingdom\u2019s swiftest runner. But he said scientists garnered important insights from nature\u2019s extremes. \u201cIt\u2019s a good place to understand the limits of what nature can offer,\u201d he said.", "description": "White bellbird\u2019s call reaches same volume as pneumatic drill during courtship ritual", "authors": ["Daniel Grossman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8717c610e28f7ab4727b395936718847106af35/0_222_2082_1249/master/2082.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=952823404562fcaae2c5098096119a53", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
