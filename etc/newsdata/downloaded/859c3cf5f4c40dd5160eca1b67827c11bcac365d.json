Stan was hitting winners from everywhere but I managed to hang in there. This is one of my biggest wins after everything.\u201d\n\nMurray\u2019s last title came in Dubai in March 2017 when he was still the top-ranked player in the world.\n\nThe Scot is attempting to defy conventional wisdom as no player has ever returned from such a hip procedure to the top levels in singles. He has been picking up encouraging victories of late and reached the quarter-finals of the China Open but Wawrinka was by far his biggest win since returning.\n\nWawrinka, who had knee surgery two years ago, broke Murray\u2019s serve in the second game of the match and dominated many of the rallies with his backhand punching holes in Murray\u2019s guard.\n\nTwo backhand winners gave Wawrinka a break for 2-1 in the second set and he then had Murray 15-40 down at 1-3.\n\nMurray survived through and became increasingly fired-up as Wawrinka\u2019s serve began to cool off.\n\nHe broke back, then saved a break point at 4-4 when he challenged an \u201cout\u201d call on a forehand before winning the replayed point and letting out a huge roar.\n\nTwo rasping backhands secured Murray the set on Wawrinka\u2019s serve and the decider was a real scrap between the old warriors.\n\nMurray had more in the tank though as he took his career record over Wawrinka to 12-8.\n\nThe Scot is about to become a father for the third time and joked that his family has grown since his enforced time away from the match court.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a third one coming so I will have three kids under four years old,\u201d Murray said.\n\n\u201cWhen I have been off Tour my family has got bigger so I need to get back on the road so we don\u2019t get out of control.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Andy Murray claimed his first ATP title since having career-saving hip surgery as he fought off Stan Wawrinka in an engrossing duel in the European Open final in Antwerp on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/339456.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
