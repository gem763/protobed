I think it's good for parliaments to stay open, that's the way we like them.\"\n\nThe leaders of the European Parliament's mainstream political groups on Thursday agreed a resolution noting the \"strong opposition in the House of Commons and beyond\" to the prorogation of the UK parliament. The MEPs agreed that the decision makes a no-deal Brexit more likely.\n\nAdditionally, when the move to suspend the UK's legislature was first announced, dozens of MPs backed an emergency question to the European Commission calling on it to invoke rule of law procedures against the UK.\n\nOn Wednesday Scotland's highest civil court ruled that it the prime minister's suspension of parliament was unlawful. The case will now go to the UK Supreme Court, with hearings starting next Tuesday.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
