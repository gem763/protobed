(Lionel Bonaventure/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe \u201cstreaming wars\u201d has turned into a catchphrase so quickly it\u2019s easy to miss how intense the battle has become.\n\nIn the past year, media companies have committed to spending hundreds of millions of dollars on content, begun building massive technological infrastructure and marketed their efforts as the must-have services of the digital age.\n\nBut where does this dizzying activity leave consumers? Which services are likely to offer the most content \u2014 and the most appealing content for you? Which services are worth subscribing to, and why?\n\nThe good news is this will be a golden age of content. The bad news is you\u2019ll have to pay a lot of different providers to get it \u2014 or make hard decisions about what to skip.\n\nTo help you make sense of the jumble, The Post has compiled this breakdown to guide you through. Read it and stream.\n\nNetflix\n\n\n\nNatasha Lyonne in a scene from \"Russian Doll.\" The program, created by Leslye Headland, Lyonne and Amy Poehler, has been nominated for an Emmy Award for outstanding comedy series. (Netflix/AP)\n\nPrice: $8.99/$12.99/$15.99 depending on plan\n\nAds: Ad-free\n\nAvailable: Now\n\nTop content offerings: Where to start? Even after all the takebacks from media companies, Netflix still offers the deepest well of content, beginning with some 4,000 movies, including 67 originals in October; among the big fall debuts is Martin Scorsese\u2019s highly anticipated mob drama \u201cThe Irishman.\u201d And on offer are thousands of hours of TV programming, including classic shows like the soon-to-debut \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and originals such as \u201cStranger Things.\u201d Not to mention foreign films (\u201cRoma,\u201d e.g.), documentaries and a host of international TV series.\n\nCompetitive strength/weakness: If you\u2019re a voracious consumer of content, Netflix remains the gold standard. The company has 150 million global subscribers for a reason. And it will spend billions of dollars on content in 2020, so don\u2019t expect the roster to diminish. What could weaken Netflix is pricing: If consumers feel like they want to cut back, Disney makes up in brand recognition what it lacks in depth \u2014 and for half the price. Apple, Hulu and others also remain cheaper options for many plans.\n\nPeacock\n\n\n\nVin Diesel in \"The Fate of the Furious,\" the eighth installment of the \"Fast & Furious\" series.\n\nPrice: N/A\n\nAds: Subscription and ad-based plans\n\nAvailable: April 2020\n\nTop content offerings: As the streaming service of Comcast\u2019s NBC Universal, Peacock will offer plenty of hit movie franchises, including \u201cJurassic Park\u201d and the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d series. Many of those 2000\u2019s-era NBC hits, such as \u201cThe Office\u201d and \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d will be there, too. Also on the horizon are reboots of some classic shows \u2014 \u201cSaved by the Bell\u201d could make devotees of Bayside High come flocking.\n\nCompetitive strength/weakness: Even after a launch announcement this week, Peacock remains one of the murkiest direct-to-consumer efforts. Unclear is how deep the content well will go \u2014 a number of past NBC hits (e.g., \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and \u201cFriends\u201d) were made by other studios and have been sold elsewhere. Also unclear is the relationship between the platform and Comcast\u2019s cable service. The company wants to walk a line between attracting cord-cutters and incentivizing customers who subscribe to Comcast. It remains to be seen how exactly they\u2019ll do this in their packages \u2014 and whether it will work.\n\nCBS All Access\n\n\n\nAdam Scott stars as Justin Sanderson in \"Nightmare at 30,000 Feet,\" a CBS All Access series. (CBS All Access) (Robert Falconer/CBS)\n\nPrice: $5.99 with ads/$9.99 without\n\nAds: Ad-free and ad-based\n\nAvailable: Now\n\nTop content offerings: Plenty of old-school TV hits, such as \u201cCheers\u201d and \u201cCagney & Lacey\u201d are on the service. So are new originals like the upcoming \u201cStar Trek: Picard\u201d spinoff, this year\u2019s \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d reboot and \u201cWhy Women Kill,\u201d the dark comedy from \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d creator Marc Cherry that was recently released. And there\u2019s \u201cThe Good Fight,\u201d the spinoff of fan favorite \u201cThe Good Wife.\u201d A subscription also comes with live CBS TV, which means NFL games, CBS News programming and the Grammys.\n\nCompetitive strength/weakness: CBS has a major streaming advantage over its network competitors: It\u2019s been doing this awhile. The first original shows launched on All Access all the way back in 2016, years before Warner and Comcast even announced plans to jump in. So there\u2019s a track record and a long slate of originals. The challenge for All Access is branding: Far fewer people know about it than they do, say, Netflix. The company said earlier this year it has 8 million digital subscribers including Showtime\u2019s service \u2014 a fraction of its Silicon Valley competitor. Part of the problem is demographic \u2014 CBS has the oldest media viewer age of all broadcast networks, a challenge given the younger ages of many streaming consumers.\n\nAmazon\n\n\n\nRachel Brosnahan stars as Midge Maisel in \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\" which won the Emmy for outstanding comedy series last year and has been nominated again. (Nicole Rivelli/Amazon/AP)\n\nPrice: Included with a $119 annual Prime subscription\n\nAds: No ads\n\nAvailable: Now\n\nTop content offerings: Amazon\u2019s been spending big on Sundance movies lately, purchasing the Adam Driver whistleblower tale \u201cThe Report\u201d and Mindy Kaling\u2019s TV dramedy \u201cLate Night,\u201d in addition to producing upcoming films like this fall\u2019s period adventure \u201cThe Aeronauts.\u201d It also has a smattering of prestige TV shows, including Emmy comedy winner \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d and current critical darling \u201cFleabag,\u201d nominated for a host of Emmys on Sunday. (Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post.)\n\nCompetitive strength/weakness: Amazon has always been something of a unicorn among streaming services, for a simple reason \u2014 it doesn\u2019t need to attract subscribers the way Netflix and others do. Hollywood content is a bonus for Prime customers, not a revenue-driver unto itself. That both frees up the company to make bold choices and has sometimes led to a muddled strategy. Under chief Jennifer Salke, who came over from NBC early last year, the tack at present seems to be to spend big on independent films as well as select big-name television properties, such as a \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d prequel. Whether Amazon will be a heavyweight or a sideline player when the streaming dust settles remains to be seen.\n\nDisney+\n\nPrice: $6.99 monthly/$5.83 a month with annual subscription\n\nAds: No ads\n\nAvailable: Nov. 12, 2019\n\nTop content offerings: Pretty much every Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars movie will eventually be here, as will new offerings like Jon Favreau\u2019s Star Wars series \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d and reboots of Disney Channel hits such as \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d and \u201cLizzie McGuire.\u201d Also, titles from the Fox library, like \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d\n\nCompetitive strength/weakness: It\u2019s hard to imagine a family in America that won\u2019t find something here to watch \u2014 and watch and watch. Disney\u2019s bet is that its brands have so infiltrated our lives that this will be a must-have in every household. You won\u2019t find more adult-skewing material (that will be on Hulu) but you\u2019ll find nearly everything else Disney has done or is doing. If you\u2019re really feeling hungry, there\u2019s a $12.99 bundle that comes with ESPN+ and Hulu.\n\nHulu\n\n\n\nA scene from \"The Handmaid's Tale\" on Hulu. Literary agent Lynn Nesbit, author Margaret Atwood and some of the forces behind the adaptation of Atwood's novel will be this year\u2019s honorees at the Center for Fiction\u2019s benefit and awards dinner. (George Kraychyk/Hulu/AP)\n\nPrice: $5.99 with ads/$11.99 without\n\nAds: Ad and ad-free versions\n\nTop content offerings: The more mature cousin of Disney+\u2019s service, Hulu most famously offers \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d not to mention a host of other higher-end darlings, like the revival of \u201cVeronica Mars.\u201d It will also be the primary conduit for Disney\u2019s blue-chip Fox acquisitions, including FX and \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d and \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d studio Fox Searchlight.\n\nCompetitive strength/weakness: The company has a clearer focus now that it\u2019s owned outright by Disney after the Fox acquisition and a Comcast and Warner buyout \u2014 important given the at-times confused strategic direction that came from multiple owners. But that could also work against it \u2014 single ownership means it won\u2019t have the benefit of either an industry-wide brain trust or library.\n\nApple TV+\n\nPrice: $4.99\n\nAds: No ads\n\nAvailable: Nov. 1, 2019\n\nTop content offerings: \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d with Jennifer Aniston, a reboot of Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cAmazing Stories\u201d anthology series, a science-fiction series with Jason Momoa titled \u201cSee\u201d and a modern take on Emily Dickinson are among the shows leading the TV slate. Also on the docket: a host of documentaries as well as upscale boutique films \u2014 the company has a producing deal with \u201cMoonlight\u201d studio A24.\n\nCompetitive strength/weakness: Apple TV+ is betting big on high-end original programming over previous mainstream hits \u2014 a kind of old-school HBO approach. It\u2019s also betting on the low cost inducing subscribers; you likely won\u2019t have to trim elsewhere to afford it.\n\nHBO Max\n\n\n\nEmilia Clarke, left, and Kit Harington in a scene from the final season of \"Game of Thrones.\" (HBO/AP)\n\nPrice: N/A\n\nAds: Ad-free and ad-supported versions\n\nAvailable: Spring 2020\n\nTop content offerings: Big Warner Bros. movies (\u201cHarry Potter\u201d and the DC Extended Universe), a raft of HBO shows (such as \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d) and a host of originals (including series reimaginings of past hits such as \u201cThe Boondocks\u201d and \u201cSnowpiercer\u201d). Also, \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d\n\nCompetitive strength/weakness: It\u2019s hard to know where Warner fits. On one hand, the studio is one of the most iconic in Hollywood history. On the other, it doesn\u2019t evoke the brand recognition of Disney. Its success will depend on whether top-tier franchises like \u201cHarry Potter\u201d will be enough to make people shell out that monthly fee. On the plus (max?) side, if you\u2019re already subscribing to HBO, this gives you a lot more content for not many more dollars.", "description": "What streaming companies are really offering.", "authors": ["Steven Zeitchik", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Entertainment In The U.S.", "September At Am", "Steven Zeitchik Covers The Business Of Entertainment For The Washington Post", "Examining The Industry'S Trends", "Challenges", "Issues", "Ideas.
