Matt Gaetz (R.-Fla.), railed at the national media as \u201cunrelenting anti-Trump, anti-Democratic in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere must be a countervailing force against these acts of evil,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier in the day, Newt Gingrich, a Fox News contributor and former House speaker from Georgia, trotted out a similar right-wing talking point on Fox personality Sean Hannity\u2019s radio show.\n\n\u201cThis is not an impeachment process,\u201d Gingrich said, as heard in the audio clip below. \u201cThis is a coup d\u2019etat.\u201d\n\nGingrich, echoing Trump, also called the impeachment probe a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d in an essay for Fox News.\n\nGingrich dismissed the mushrooming investigation into Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump repeatedly asked Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son.\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with impeachment,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cIt has nothing to do with the rule of law. It has nothing to do with facts.\u201d", "description": "Newt Gingrich and Lou Dobbs' cry \"coup d'etat\" about the legitimate process unfolding against Donald Trump in the Ukraine whistleblower scandal.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d932ab42200003000dbccaa.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
