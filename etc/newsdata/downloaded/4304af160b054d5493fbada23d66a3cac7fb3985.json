In March, Williams underwent a medical procedure to remove a benign minor on his scalp. He was reportedly upset with the way the Redskins\u2019 medical staff handled that issue, vowing privately to never play for them again.\n\nThe helmet twist is the latest development in Williams\u2018 dispute with the Redskins, making it unclear if the seven-time Pro Bowler will suit up for Washington this season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that he does,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cI have a lot of respect for Trent and what he\u2019s achieved here, what he\u2019s done. \u2026 I think his heart is in the right spot. Trent loves football, there\u2019s nobody that loves football more that\u2019s into it, that studies the game, that really gets into the matchups and is challenged by the matches.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that he has a love and passion for playing football.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins were granted a roster exemption and have up to two weeks to activate him to the roster. They play Buffalo on Sunday and then have their bye week.\n\nCallahan said he met with Williams for an hour earlier in the morning and the left tackle also participated in team meetings. He called Williams\u2018 issue with his helmet \u201cday-to-day,\u201d and said his conversation with him was positive.\n\nWashington opted not to trade Williams before Tuesday\u2019s trade deadline, not getting an offer that met its asking price. The Redskins had resisted the idea of trading Williams for months, but reportedly entertained offers in recent days. The team could still look to deal him in the offseason.\n\nBy showing up Tuesday, Williams likely did so to ensure he\u2019ll get credit toward free agency. His current deal expires in 2021, but his contract would have carried over if he had missed the entire season (pushing back free agency until 2022).\n\nWilliams missed eight total games in his time away from the Redskins, in which the team went 1-7. In his absence, veteran Donald Penn has done a solid job of filling in for the Oklahoma product.\n\nWilliams was not in the team\u2019s locker room when reporters were present, but his teammates voiced their support for him. Rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins met Williams for the first time, calling him a \u201cpretty cool dude.\u201d\n\nRight tackle Morgan Moses, who donned his teammate\u2019s jersey in training camp at a post-practice press conference, said Williams \u201clooks great.\u201d\n\nThe left tackle spent his time away from the Redskins working out in Houston and Los Angeles to stay in physical shape.\n\n\u201cHe has decisions to make,\u201d Moses said. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s not ironed out yet but you want to see him here, selfishly I want to see him playing with me, with the guys. Honestly, he\u2019s his own business.\n\n\u201cHe has some things he needs to take care of and until he feels that those needs are answered you got to wait and see if he plays or not.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
