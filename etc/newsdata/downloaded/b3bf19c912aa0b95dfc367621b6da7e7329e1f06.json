Now, the company produces its products in countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia.\n\nThe U.S. and China imposed new tariffs on each other's goods on Sunday, intensifying a long-drawn trade dispute between the world's two largest economies.\n\nLever Style is also trying to change the way it's managed as a factory, such as by working with production partners around the region instead of going it alone, Szeto told CNBC. The company's clients include fashion labels such as Coach and Paul Smith.\n\n\"In the past, people build factories and they take years to buy the land, build the facility, hire the people, (but) now we are figuring out how to do things in a more versatile manner,\" said Szeto.\n\nHowever, garment manufacturing is labor intensive \u2014 one factor that could limit the business's flexibility, according to Szeto.\n\n\"The more labor intensive things are, the harder it is to just spread things around too much. We are constantly evaluating and seeing what's the best combination that gives us cost effectiveness as well as agility,\" he said.", "description": "It's crucial for businesses to be flexible and to hedge one's bets amid the protracted and unpredictable trade war, according to a Hong Kong-based garment maker.", "authors": ["Huileng Tan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105984694-1561385185848photooct03115937am.jpg?v=1567399095"}
