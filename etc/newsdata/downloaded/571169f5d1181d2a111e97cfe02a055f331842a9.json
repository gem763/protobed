It is aiming for a million customers, and looking to make a splash with a bright yellow debit card\n\nRBS's former chief operating officer Mark Bailie, who now runs B\u00f3, told the FT in an interview in April that there was a possibility the UK's challenger banks, occasionally written off on account of being unprofitable, could end up emulating the likes of Amazon.\n\nAs well as building B\u00f3, RBS also poured \u00a35million into a mobile-based debit card provider aimed at students called Loot, which folded in May.\n\nWhat's in a name? RBS's new digital bank offering appears to take its name from the Danish for 'to live', or 'stay'. Perhaps the bank was looking to emulate another Scandinavian import that became a popular movement a few years ago. In 2016, the word 'hygge' was named on the Oxford English Dictionary's 'Word of the Year' shortlist, along with Brexit. The word supposedly denotes a feeling of 'calm togetherness and the enjoyment of simple pleasures', and no fewer than nine books on the subject, and how you could achieve it, were published that year. If B\u00f3 achieves anywhere near that level of mass cultural cut-through, however much RBS will have spent on developing it will seem like a bargain.\n\nIt was claimed RBS was originally interested in buying the app outright before Loot had to resort to a failed attempt at online crowdfunding.\n\nLoot's founder Ollie Purdue and 17 other ex-employees of the app subsequently joined RBS's new digital bank, according to TechCrunch.\n\nWhile RBS has clearly taken an interest in trying to change its digital offerings in a bid to head off the threat of the challenger banks, most of the UK\u2019s biggest high street names are doing much the same thing.\n\nIn April RBS's stablemate NatWest announced a trial of a new mobile banking assistant called Mimo, which it was claimed would use open banking to look at users' bills and day-to-day spending, and 'help customers manage their financial life'.\n\nHSBC's offshoot First Direct is also believed to be overhauling its offering to appeal to younger customers, with measures that include an in-app marketplace and a 'financial autopilot' that would make personalised recommendations to users.\n\nMeanwhile Lloyds Banking Group hired ex-Silicon Valley stalwart Dan Makoski to improve its online banking offering.\n\nIn an interview with This is Money in May, he said: 'To me, the future of banking isn't going to some provider that gives you this one account, it's actually whoever you trust to help you manage your life.'\n\nRBS declined to comment to This is Money on the rumoured Monzo approach.", "description": "One of the UK's biggest banks RBS considered trying to take over challenger bank Monzo two years ago but was put off by the asking price, reports claim.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
