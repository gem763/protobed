He was registered as a lobbyist for the National Association of Software and Service Companies, which represents Indian and U.S. companies that aim to keep the the H-1B visa program for foreign workers with advanced degrees. In 2016, Trump criticized the H-1B visa program, calling it \u201ca cheap labor\u201d program.\n\nWolf has spent years advocating for \u201ccheap foreign tech workers,\u201d said a senior DHS official, who said Wolf\u2019s appointment might cause them to resign. \u201cHe was the lone voice the previous secretary listened to. Her views on border enforcement, public charge and protecting American workers are his views\u2026.I signed up for the Trump message, not the Jeb Bush administration.\u201d\n\nA former DHS colleague of Wolf's pushed back on the notion that Wolf isn't as tough on immigration as Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s a bizarre dynamic that these so-called hawks label anybody, other than [senior policy adviser] Stephen Miller, as soft on immigration,\u201c this person said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know where they\u2019re getting it from that Chad\u2019s immigration views diverge from the president.\u201d\n\nCuccinelli and Morgan didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The White House also didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nActing Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nTrump could still ignore the advice from staff and name Cuccinelli or Morgan as an acting secretary \u2014 though he would likely face an immediate legal challenge \u2014 or consider them for permanent job if he chooses to nominate someone.\n\n\u201cI think he would look at either of them as more of a permanent nominee than as an acting person,\u201d a White House official said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the goal would be to have another long-term acting. It would be to have somebody acting while the nominee\u2019s confirmed.\u201d\n\nThe president has long favored acting officials and, at least one person familiar with the situation says, he is expected to appoint a secretary on a temporary basis as he enters the final year of his term. It would be tough to get the type of leader he wants confirmed by even the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nTrump has gone through four DHS secretaries in less than three years in part because he and his allies grew dissatisfied with officials they thought were not sufficiently committed to the president\u2019s immigration agenda.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t agree inside the White House on what immigration policy should be,\u201c said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which pushes for less immigration.\n\nTrump announced two weeks ago that Kevin McAleenan would step down as acting secretary after serving just six months. Although he oversaw a reduction in the number of migrants caught at the southwest border, Trump allies complained he wasn\u2019t fully implementing the president\u2019s policies.\n\nNext in line to become acting secretary is Pekoske, who has also been serving as acting deputy secretary at DHS, but he has reportedly taken himself out of the running.\n\nTrump has been pushed to give the job to Cuccinelli, a newcomer to the administration who has quickly developed direct access to the president, according to five people familiar with the situation.\n\nCuccinelli, acting head of the relatively obscure U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, is one of the president\u2019s top lieutenants for his aggressive immigration agenda who has the support of leading DHS officials.\n\nMark Morgan, acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, is also being considered, according to the people familiar with the situation. He rejoined the Trump administration in May as acting ICE director, but moved to CBP the next month. The appointment represented a rapid ascent for the former Obama official, who left his post as Border Patrol chief during the early days of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nA statute that governs DHS succession places the deputy secretary and under secretary for management in line for the acting secretary role, although both of those positions are currently filled by acting officials.\n\nA separate federal law that outlines procedures for filling vacancies requires that acting officials be either the \u201cfirst assistant\u201d to the position, a Senate-confirmed official detailed to the role or a senior employee at the agency for 90 days during a 365-day period before the vacancy occurred.\n\nCuccinelli and Morgan joined after the departure of Nielsen, the last Senate-confirmed DHS chief.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/36/67/cfb199014a49ae5a65356a7ef940/20191021-cuccinelli-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
