The move means Xfinity customers can no longer see Starz shows like \u201cPower\u201d and \u201cOutlander,\u201d about a British army nurse during World War II, without coughing up an extra $12 a month.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why @Comcast is working against me,\u201d 50 Cent wrote on his Instagram page over the weekend. The actor, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, directed followers to a website where disgruntled fans could call to \u201cdemand a refund!\u201d\n\nComcast kicked Starz off its Xfinity bundle after the cable channel began selling directly to consumers online through streaming platforms like Amazon AMZN, +1.60% Prime, Roku ROKU, +2.38% and the Starz app. That made it a less valuable asset, a Comcast rep told The Post last week. \u201cAll we are asking for is the same treatment for our customers.\u201d\n\nComcast argues that Xfinity consumers can now get Starz a la carte for an additional $12 \u2014 just as they would if they bought the channel and streamed it.\n\nBut the dispute also foreshadows a broader blackout by the cable company of Starz\u2019s programming across other platforms in order to convince Starz to lower its prices, experts say. Comcast would hold the cards in that fight as its pre-packaged programming makes up one-third of Starz\u2019s 26.5 million subscribers and roughly $250 million in annual revenue.\n\nIf the DOJ moves forward with an investigation, it would have to prove that Comcast is using its power to make it difficult for streaming services like Roku to work with content companies like Starz, sources said.\n\nThe cable company has not received any subpoenas, indicating that a formal probe has not been launched, a source said.\n\n\u201cProgram carriage issues have never provided a basis for plausible antitrust concerns,\u201d a Comcast rep told The Post. \u201cToday, with the current state of the market where programmers have so many options, it is hard to see any viable antitrust claim against a distributor.\u201d\n\nThis story originally appeared at NYPost.com", "description": "The Department of Justice is weighing a probe into Comcast\u2019s threats to charge consumers extra for movie channel Starz, which is behind shows like \u201cPower\u201d...", "authors": ["Alexandra Steigrad", "Josh Kosman"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HC516_apcomc_ZG_20190123143846.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
