Both are used to treat bladder stones - hard lumps of minerals that can form inside the bladder when it's not completely empty of urine. In a cystolitholapaxy, an instrument called a cystoscope is inserted into the bladder to locate the bladder stone or stones. The cystoscope is a long, narrow tube with a small camera at one end. It is connected to a stone-crushing device, which uses laser energy or ultrasound waves to break up the stones into smaller fragments. A cystolithotomy is the surgical removal of bladder stones via a lower abdominal incision. It is normally used when a cystolitholapaxy has failed to remove the stones.\n\nThey put the patient under using anaesthetic and carried out a cystolitholapaxy.\n\nThe medical procedure involves using a stone-crushing device with lasers or ultrasound waves to break up bladder stones into smaller fragments.\n\nThe medics used a laser to shave down the bullet, eroding away its outer layer of stone.\n\nBut the inner portion of the stone proved difficult to break down. Bullet debris and stone material were recovered when the patient next urinated.\n\nThe remaining bullet fragment had sharp edges and would have caused damage if it passed through the bladder neck and urethra.\n\nThe patient returned to the operating room for an open cystolithotomy - the surgical removal of bladder stones via a lower abdominal incision.\n\nThe incision was closed in two layers, and the bullet was handed over to police when it was extracted.\n\nDoctors noted that current research advises surgeons remove bullet fragments in joints, vessels or around the eye to avoid it causes more damage down the line.\n\nBut they recognise there is limited data on whether it should be removed to prevent long-term complications elsewhere.\n\nConsultant urologist Dr Rich Viney, based at the Bladder Clinic in Birmingham, told MailOnline: 'This is an unusual case but not unique.\n\n'When confronted with a foreign object the body will initially wall it off with scar tissue.\n\n'It will then, slowly propel it towards the nearest external surface to expel it from the body. Normally this is back long the entry route taken by the foreign object.\n\n'In this case the bullet had passed through the bladder so it is no surprise that it has been expelled back along the tract into the bladder.\n\n'The time spans for this kind of process is variable but can often be measured in years. Once in the bladder it might pass down the urethra if small enough.'\n\nHe added: 'If not small enough stone will sit in bladder and crystals will form on its surface forming a bladder stone.'", "description": "The patient, from Connecticut, experienced shooting pain whenever he used the toilet or ejaculated for a year before he sought help.
