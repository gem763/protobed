Singh\u2019s background as a popular YouTuber\u2014someone used to delivering funny commentary and making viral videos for nearly 15 million subscribers\u2014should have translated easily to the current model of late-night TV: gimmick-driven clips, lighthearted games, and deep dives. But even though her monologues cover the same topics she addressed on her channel, these brief meditations on relationships, aging, fashion, and the like come off awkward in a live-TV setting. (A set about Raya, the celebrity dating app that\u2019s been around since 2015, felt especially stale.) Singh has made it clear that she won\u2019t be talking politics; the goal is \u201cto be a little more personal, a little more based in her experiences,\u201d the show\u2019s producer, John Irwin, told The Hollywood Reporter. But these evergreen musings feel more like rejected bits from a stand-up set than refreshing, fully formed segments that can hold an audience\u2019s attention in the middle of the night.\n\nAs the author of the memoir/self-help guide How to Be a Bawse: A Guide to Conquering Life, Singh champions female ambition, so most of her shorts revolve around the idea of being a #girlboss. That\u2019s a positive, largely inoffensive message, and some sketches\u2014like the one on the wage gap set in an \u201980s workout video\u2014are clever. But the ethos of leaning in is well-trodden territory in comedy, and too many of Singh\u2019s filmed segments rehash the idea without delivering a punch line or a fresh take.\n\nOnce Singh is sitting opposite a guest, however, she seems much more comfortable with the gig. Behind her desk, which is adorned with a picture of her dog and a stock photo of french fries\u2014\u201cmy son and my love, together,\u201d she explained\u2014Singh gets a chance to cut loose and build a dynamic rapport with her guests. In these chats, Singh delivers some of her best, off-the-cuff humor. In one episode, when the comedian Chelsea Handler asked what to do with a prop during a segment, Singh responded, \u201cYou smoke it,\u201d prompting a giggle from the usually stoic Handler.\n\nAnother night, the comedian Jim Gaffigan mentioned how clean he found Singh\u2019s home country. \u201cI\u2019ve never even seen a wrapper on the street in Toronto,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she deadpanned, \u201cwe have Drake.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the episode with Gaffigan presented an unusual challenge for Singh. Gaffigan had been paired with Queer Eye\u2019s Antoni Porowski, but even with two guests promoting different projects, sharing the couch and the conversation, Singh thrived, proving herself a rather adept moderator who could riff with Gaffigan on his parenting skills but also grill Porowski on how he finished his latest cookbook.\n\nOf all the skills she developed from her YouTube days, her conversational tone made the leap to television most successfully. And even though much of the chitchat has been preplanned, as is customary with talk shows, Singh is still witty. That makes her disarming to her guests, most of whom are more used to older men in suits posing the questions in a staid atmosphere. Opposite Singh, guests are kept on their toes , but they also feel relaxed enough to settle into the couch. The actress Anna Faris even kicked off her heels as soon as she sat down.", "description": "The internet star snagged an NBC show because of her YouTube charm, but she\u2019s still finding her footing in a traditional arena.", "authors": ["Shirley Li"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/NUP_188615_0303/facebook.jpg?1570284878", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
