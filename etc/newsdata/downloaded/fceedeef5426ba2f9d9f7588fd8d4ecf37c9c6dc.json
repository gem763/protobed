She's very dead. I can't go closer, I can't go nearer. What am I going to tell my daughter?'\n\nHe wails: \"She's lying on the floor in a pool of blood. Her brains are everywhere it looks like she's had her head beaten in.\"\n\n(Image: Cheshire Pplice)\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\nThrough laboured breathing, he tells the operator: \"Jesus, I can't believe it.\"\n\nHe confirms he is near her body as he speaks to the dispatcher: \"Oh God I can't go closer, I can't go nearer.\"\n\nHe then delivered an energetic performance in the back of an ambulance that was captured on a police bodycam, claiming to the officer he had just stumbled across the grisly scene.\n\n\"She was just lying there. Oh god she was just lying there,\" Pomphret tells him.\n\nFor months afterward he insisted he had simply come across his dead wife in the field.\n\nHis lies were so compelling, he made detectives consider a complete stranger was responsible for the tragedy.\n\nBut as the weeks ticked by, and police steadily un-picked his story, it became increasingly clear that the only person who could have killed Ann Marie was her own husband.\n\n(Image: CHRIS NEILL/MAVERICK PHOTOGRAPHY)\n\n(Image: CHRIS NEILL/MAVERICK PHOTOGRAPHY)\n\nDuring 15 exhaustive interviews, the senior bank worker made a dramatic U-turn and admitted he was behind her death.\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to escape, he claimed he was not responsible for murder because he had temporarily \"lost control\" on that fateful night.\n\nA jury last Friday found Pomphret guilty of murder and he has now been jailed for life with a minimum term of 20 years.\n\nIt emerged the technology guru had realised what his ideal life could be like with his 18-year-old daughter Megan and his wife \"off the scene\" after Ann Marie - who had autism and cancer - spent three days in hospital.\n\nDetective inspector Adam Waller said: \"Ultimately, because of her [health] challenges and temper, it's our case he lost temper, has become angry and got fed up.\n\n\"He's had three days, when she's been in hospital, with Megan at home, and he's realised what life could be like.\n\n\"It was put to him that he decided enough was enough.\"\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\nAnn Marie, the court was told, would often criticise her husband.\n\nUltimately, it was Pomphret's own \"forensic\" and detailed account of the family's movements that night which proved the unravelling of his web of lies.\n\nDI Waller added: \"The one thing that came back to haunt him - he forgot to change his socks.\n\n\"Yes, he was meticulous, but he made mistakes.\n\n\"And he has made some crucial mistakes...he didn't realise there was a CCTV camera on the way in and out of his [Masefield Avenue in Winwick] estate, and he didn't change his socks.\n\n\"It's our job to prove he didn't lose control and that's the defence he's raised.\n\n\"It is our case he only raised that defence once he realised the game was up...\n\n\"The weight of evidence against him, that evidence was put to him on his re-arrest in April.\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\n\"It was put to him about the CCTV which undermined his account...he was told about the forensic evidence, the airborne blood that was on his sock, he was told about the [incriminating] telecommunications evidence, and his account was unpicked in front of him in interview.\n\n\"He was asked to account for that and he was unable to do so, when faced with that overwhelming evidence.\n\n\"At some point, a month after he was charged, he's made the decision to say this is futile, and he has to admit he is the person who has killed Marie.\n\n\"He said they [Pomphret and Ann Marie] drove past the stables, they didn't stop, they drove past and arrived home at 8pm.\n\n\"He said shortly after that he said Marie needed to go to the stables and she jumped in her car and she drove down to the stables.\n\n\"That was a lie.\"\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\nOn the night in question, his wife had slapped him across the face, Pomphret claimed, and poured scorn on some of his efforts to carry out DIY tasks at their home.\n\nDI Waller said: \"There's no doubt, Marie presented some challenges with her behaviour sometimes.\n\n\"To balance that, there's a significant number of people who have paid testament to her kindness, her passion for horses, her pride for her daughter...she could be the best mum and wife in the world, and one of the kindest people in the world.\n\n\"Due to her diagnosed mental health difficulties, and physical health issues, she will have presented some challenging behaviour at times.\n\n\"But what's come out, it doesn't paint a picture of significant domestic violence.\n\n\"Ann Marie is a vulnerable lady that at time struggles to manage her behaviour.\n\n\"Pomphret and their daughter have learnt to deal with her behaviour very very well....they were married for the best part of 30 years, he knows how to manage her behaviour, he knows what escalates her behaviour and how to diffuse it.\"\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\nDI Waller described the couple's daughter's ordeal as \"a living nightmare\".\n\nHe added: \"Megan is in a living nightmare....her mother is dead and she did love her mother and her mother loved her.\n\n\"She has a very close bond with her father and she's in a really difficult place as she knows her father has killed her mother.\n\n\"For 18, Megan is a very mature individual - the way the family have conducted themselves truly deserves acknowledgement.\"", "description": "David Pomphret, of Warrington, Cheshire, fibbed to police he had found his wife's body with her brains everywhere in a foiled plot to cover up the murder", "authors": ["Talia Shadwell", "Image", "Liverpool Echo", "Cheshire Pplice", "Chris Neill Maverick Photography"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20595183.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-JS195680400.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
