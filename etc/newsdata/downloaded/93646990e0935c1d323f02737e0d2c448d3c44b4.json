Many Ford workers believe GM strikers are sacrificing for them. But it's also curiosity. The deal the union ultimately gets with GM will influence the fates of hourly workers at Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.\n\nThen, there is the fear.\n\n\"If Ford isn\u2019t willing to budge on the same sticking points as GM, then the UAW might take us all out on strike,\" said James Benson, a team leader in the body shop at the Dearborn Truck plant. \"A better part of our workforce is probably not prepared for something long term. They are worried about a strike.\"\n\nMack Truck strike: More than 3,600 workers go on strike at Mack Truck plants in 3 states\n\n2020 Corvette: It's not just super-fast; it\u2019s luxury-car quiet and smooth\n\nKevin Donnellon, 23, of Eastpointe a striking GM worker checks out a box of supplies that include canned goods and ramen at the Local 163 in Westland, Monday, Oct. 14, 2019. Ford and FCA workers are donating food and other items to help strikers make ends meet. More\n\nAt 12:01 a.m. Sept. 16, about 46,000 GM union workers went on a nationwide strike. GM and UAW negotiators continue to meet daily, well into the evening. The most recent main sticking points have been the length of time for in-progression workers to reach a full wage, product allocation and updating pension and 401(k) formulas.\n\nFord and Fiat Chrysler workers might not be eager to live on $275 a week in strike wages as GM workers have done for a month, but they are stepping up to help their union brothers and sisters with support on the picket line and cash and food donations.\n\n\"They\u2019re all picketing, every single one of them,\" said Joe Garrett, Local 163's shop chairman at GM's Romulus Powertrain.\n\nEvery day, 15 to 30 Ford and FCA workers appear at the three Romulus Powertrain gates to join the GM strikers and spend an hour on the picket line, said Garrett.\n\n\"They lift our spirits on the picket line and there\u2019s just massive caring and giving,\" Garrett said.\n\nSteve Van Norman, 62, of Romulus and a 23 year GM employee, grabs a box of supplies to help out his family, Monday, Oct. 14, 2019, as Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles workers are donating food and other items at the Local 163 in Westland, Mich. More\n\nImpact the future\n\nMany Ford and FCA UAW members say they are watching GM talks intently.\n\nIn pattern bargaining, the UAW chooses a target company to negotiate with first, then uses that agreement as a template for bargaining with the other two.\n\n\"At Dearborn Truck Plant we put out a weekly bulletin and the main thing we\u2019ve talked about is the importance of this strike to Ford and Chrysler workers,\" said Gary Walkowicz, bargain committeeman at the F-150 plant.\n\nFive to six days a week Walkowicz pickets with GM\u2019s UAW workers at Romulus Powertrain and Detroit-Hamtramck plants for about an hour each time, he said.\n\n\u201cThere were Chrysler and Ford workers there too,\u201d said Walkowicz. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few days when we\u2019ve had different crews come out together and we\u2019ve had good turnout. We had a day with about 100 Ford workers that came to Romulus.\u201d\n\nMost of the Ford and FCA UAW members are ready to help because \u201cthis fight is our fight,\u201d Walkowicz said. \"This can greatly impact our contract and our future.\"\n\nStrikers walk the line at Romulus Powertrain, Monday, Oct. 14, 2019.
