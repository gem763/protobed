Their visit comes at a time when animosity towards the Americans is on the rise among United supporters, with the club seemingly some distance away from challenging for honours.\n\nUnited currently sit just two points above the relegation zone and the NFL match, at which members of the Glazer family are expected to be present, may provide an opportunity for angry fans to make their feelings made in public.\n\nOrganisers and the police do not expect that Sunday's NFL match at Tottenham will be used by disgruntled Manchester United fans to stage an attention-grabbing protest\n\nThe fixture, which is close to a sell-out, will be televised in both the UK and the US but NFL insiders are not thought to harbour concerns over the prospect of what could prove to be an embarrassing situation.\n\nThe Bucs have played on these shores previously and there have been no such issues \u2013 although United's current predicament may well raise an increased likelihood of some form of protest on this visit.\n\nPolice involved in the security operation are aware of the situation but are confident that a bag search policy will stop any potentially offensive banners from being brought into the stadium.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers like United are owned by the Glazer family - Buccaneers Co-chairman Joel Glazer (left) and Manchester United Executive Co-chairman Avram Glazer\n\nThe Glazer family took over United in 2005 thanks to a heavily-leveraged buyout.\n\nUnited's last financials, released at the end of last month (SEP), show that the club remains in debt to the tune of around \u00a3203.6million, although they were keen to point out that the figure represented the smallest figure since the takeover.\n\nDespite relatively heavy spending of late, some fans have accused United's owners of using the club as a cashpoint, given dividends have consistently been paid out to family members over the past four years.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE BY MIKE KEEGAN: The Tampa Bay Buccaneers' visit comes at a time when animosity towards the Americans is on the rise among Manchester United supporters.", "authors": ["Mike Keegan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/08/19648078-0-image-a-8_1570951709492.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
