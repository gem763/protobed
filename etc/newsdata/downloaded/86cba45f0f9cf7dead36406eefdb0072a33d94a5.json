Bloodied, bruised, battered.\n\nIt is 12 years since New Zealand lost a game at a World Cup but, on this famous night in Yokohama, they had no answers.\n\nIt was a tactical masterclass. An exhibition of power and precision and turnovers and outright destruction at the gain line.\n\nEngland will move onto next week\u2019s final \u2013 against Wales or South Africa \u2013 as favourites. This was unstoppable.\n\nOn the 20-minute walk from Yokohama station to the stadium, street hawkers set up stalls selling New Zealand merchandise. Black shirts, black scarves, black everything. All Blacks billboards light up street corners in Tokyo, where they are firmly established as the nation\u2019s second team.\n\nThe All Blacks have, at times, been bigger than rugby itself but England laughed in the face of recent history.\n\nManu Tuilagi pushes through a crowd of New Zealand bodies and touches down for England's first try after a fast start\n\n\u2018Whoever wins this game will win the final\u2026 so make that three in a row for the All Blacks!!\u2019 guffawed a New Zeland supporter, before the cocky Kiwis were sent packing.\n\nBefore kick-off, England set up a seven-metre wide channel down the touchline and had to smash their way through six forwards. Joe Marler grabbed Kyle Sinckler by the scruff of his t-shirt and revved him up with a few choice words, while Steve Hansen watched from the half-way line with his hands in his pockets.\n\nFor a team who are always on message of focussing on themselves, the All Blacks coach took a particularly keen interest in England\u2019s preparations. Bish, bash, bosh down the tramlines; a sign of what was to come.\n\nTuilagi is swarmed by his team-mates after his early try as England made a huge impact on the game despite being underdogs\n\nEngland spread out in a \u2018V formation to defuse the haka. Nigel Owens tried to motion English players back as Joe Marler and Billy Vunipola, on the outside flanks, crept over the halfway line. Owen Farrell held his position at the rear with hands on hips, grinning like a smiling assassin. The All Blacks had to adapt their positions. England had snatched the initiative and never let it go.\n\nThis game had been given the big sell and it lived up to its billing in the first 98 seconds.\n\nMaintaining the intensity from their preparations, England\u2019s players came out flying. Step up the wrecking balls. Manu Tuilagi bashed up the first carry before Tom Curry followed his lead. Switching grace for grunt, Elliot Daly skipped around Richie Mo\u2019unga and England used every inch of width on the pitch.\n\nGeorge Ford dispatches a penalty as England began to strengthen their grip on a place in the Rugby World Cup final\n\nThe players form into a V shape formation to stand up to the Kiwis before their Haka after edging closer to their opponents\n\nEngland stare down the intimidating dance as New Zealand look to get the upper hand before their crunch semi-final\n\nMATCH FACTS England: Daly; Watson, Tuilagi, Farrell, May; Ford, Youngs; Vunipola, George, Sinckler; Itoje, Lawes; Curry, Vunipola, Underhill. Replacements: Cowan-Dickie, Marler, Cole, Kruis, Wilson, Heinz, Slade, Joseph. Tries: Tuilagi Pens: Ford (4) Con: Farrell New Zealand: Barrett, Reece, Goodhue, Lienert-Brown, Bridge, Mo'unga, Smith, Read (c), Savea, Barrett, Whitelock, Retallick, Laulala, Taylor, Moody. Replacements: Coles, Tuungafasi, Ta'avao, Tuipulotu, Cane, Perenara, Williams, Barrett. Tries: Savea Con: Mo\u2019unga Referee: Nigel Owens (Wales)\n\nJamie George hugged the left touchline, accelerating into contact, before Courtney Lawes and Kyle Sinckler found ways to slip the ball out of the tackle. Left, right, left. Bish, bash bosh. Ben Youngs kept it all ticking, before Tuilagi dived over from close range. The dream start.\n\nMinutes earlier, the stadium announcer called out the names of both teams before kick-off. There was warm applause for the English team - called out from 15 to 1 \u2013 before a rapturous reception to the first Kiwi name, Beauden Barrett. It was a Kiwi party but the English had taken over.\n\nGeorge Ford has spent his whole career facing questions about his size, but how he laughed in the questioners\u2019 face when he ripped the ball from the clutch of prop Nepo Lualua in the tackle. Everything he touched turned to gold. Next up, his long kick forced rookie winger George Bridge to turn. By the time he had turned back, English kick-chasers were already foaming at the mouth.\n\nThe pace was breathless. In attack, Ford and Owen Farrell weaved patterns like a Japanese tapestry. Forwards kept the ball alive in contact to stitch phase after phase.\n\nWith Scott Barrett at six, New Zealand, they said, would have the advantage at the lineout. Back in 2014, Brodie Retallick could not name a single player in the England team. He referred to Courtney Lawes as \u2018Michael\u2019 \u2013 but there will be no mistaking his name after England\u2019s locks stole ball after ball.\n\nLawes plucked the ball out of Sam Whitelock\u2019s hands, before Itoje \u2013 all limbs and elbows \u2013 forced a turnover at the maul. \u2018Oh Maro Itoje,\u2019 chanted the English fans, who couldn\u2019t quite believe what they were seeing.\n\nEngland could have won by a much bigger margin, but a try by Ben Youngs was ruled out by referee Nigel Owens\n\nEngland almost moved further ahead. Underhill ran under the posts, but his try was ruled out after a blocking line by Curry.\n\nA stroke of fortune for the Kiwis, but not a momentum swing. The world champions made mistakes in the face of England\u2019s pressure, with the Kamikaze Kids \u2013 Curry and Underhill \u2013 on hand to punish every error.\n\nBridge was smashed into touch by Anthony Watson and the face of Steve Hansen appeared on the big screen. The Kiwi coach rarely appears flustered but his head dropped into his hands. New Zealand were rattled but the only saving grace was that England hadn\u2019t scored more points.\n\nFord took over the kicking as Farrell grimaced through the first half after picking up a knock, but pushed a drop goal wide of the posts.\n\nBut Curry continued to boss the breakdown and, with some help from Tuilagi, won a turnover just before hale-time to allow Ford to extend the lead to 10.\n\nKiwis flanker Ardie Savea breaks through England's resistance after the interval to put New Zealand back in the contest\n\nSavea's team-mates congratulate him after his try as New Zealand look to put England under pressure in Yokohama\n\n\u2018New Zealand will come back, they always do,\u2019 muttered the half-time cynics who had been there before.\n\nHansen sent on Sam Cane to help with the breakdown, but England continued to apply the pressure. Daly sent a penalty just wide after Whitelock blocked Youngs, but quickly regathered his composure. He turned over Barrett under the highball to give England territory, before Youngs eventually sniped over. But, again, the TMO intervened and England had a second try ruled out.\n\nJonny May and Kyle Sinckler both limped off, before English hearts were in mouths when a no arms challenge from replacement Henry Slade was sent for a referral. Slade escaped a yellow card but the Kiwis were fired up.\n\nMaro Itoje competes with New Zealand's Brodie Retallick at a line out as England look to close in on a hard-earned victory\n\nEngland had a lineout on their own 5m line but George overthrew though Itoje\u2019s fingers and Ardie Savea gathered the ball to score almost unopposed. One mistake, one try. England 13-7 All Blacks.\n\nIt took another trademark hit from Underhill \u2013 the biggest tackler at this World Cup \u2013 to give England some breathing space. He crunched Jordie Barrett in his own 22, forcing a knock on which eventually resulted in three more points for Ford.\n\nEngland had 16 minutes to defend their lead. Time for the early summer days in Treviso \u2013 months back now \u2013 when England were sprinting and sweating and spewing to pay off.\n\nGeorge Ford was the hero from the tee as he hit four penalties to help England see off the huge threat from the Kiwis\n\nNew Zealand centre Anton Lienert-Brown is distraught as his heavily-backed team are dumped out of the competition\n\nDelighted England players congratulate each other on their remarkable achievement as the Kiwi players lament the loss\n\nEngland coach Eddie Jones has helped the team bounce back from a woeful 2015 tournament by guiding them to the final\n\nFor a split second, New Zealand had a chance to kick at goal. But Whitelock had shoved his palm into Farrell\u2019s face in the act of winning the penalty. Farrell received treatment on the ground until replays were when on the big screen and Owens reversed his decision. Gamesmanship? We may never know.\n\nMore penalties, more points for Ford. England gradually moved out of sight. Their finishers came on and ground New Zealand into a black and white dust.\n\nIt triggered an English party, singing Oasis under the night sky, but the party is only just getting started.", "description": "NIK SIMON: This was the day when England took rugby to a new level.
