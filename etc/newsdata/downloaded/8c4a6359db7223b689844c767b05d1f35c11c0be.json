The Trump administration has blocked Congress from seeing the complaint.\n\nTrump has suggested he did bring up Biden during the call, but has dismissed allegations of anything untoward. He told reporters there would likely be a readout of the call released.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nonsense,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen you see the call, when you see the readout of the call, which I assume you\u2019ll see at some point, that call was perfect, it couldn\u2019t have been nicer.\u201d\n\nTrump repeated his contention that Biden is the one who should be investigated. The president and his allies have accused Biden of pressuring Ukraine in 2016 to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin to benefit his son.\n\nHunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. At the time that then-vice president Joe Biden sought the ouster of the top Ukrainian prosecutor, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nTrump\u2019s discussing a political opponent with a foreign leader has renewed calls for his impeachment among House Democrats. Trump said Tuesday that the impeachment discussion is \u201cridiculous\u201d and, as he did with the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, called it a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m leading in the polls. They have no idea how they stop me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe only way they can try is through impeachment.\u201d\n\nNearly every poll has Biden defeating Trump nationwide and in battleground states.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump addresses reporters as he arrives with first lady Melania Trump for the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly, at U.N. headquarters on Sept. 24.
