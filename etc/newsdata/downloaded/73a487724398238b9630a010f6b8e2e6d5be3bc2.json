(AP) - Quarterback Mitchell Trubisky is taking the heat after the Chicago Bears scored only 19 points in the first two games.\n\nTeammates and coaches insist there\u2019s blame to go around for the poor start on offense as the Bears (1-1) get ready to try to find the end zone when they travel to face the Washington Redskins (0-2) Monday night.\n\n\u201cSo we kind of had this last year in the beginning of the season where we had some offensive struggles on third down, not clicking,\u201d Trubisky said Thursday.\n\nThere are parallels to 2018, especially in yardage and the overall record. The Bears have only 12 fewer passing yards (328) and 26 fewer rushing yards (199) than last season after two games, when they were also 1-1.\n\nThe difference has been the point production and Trubisky\u2019s lack of consistent passing. They had 33 points from their offense last year at this time. Trubisky is coming off a 120-yard passing performance.\n\n\u201cHopefully that is not us anymore,\u201d Trubisky said.\n\nThe problem is the Bears spent all offseason trying to convince everyone it wasn\u2019t their offense anymore and it has been. They are back near the bottom, ranked 30th in yardage and ahead of only the lowly Miami Dolphins in scoring.\n\n\u201cWe went through a very similar deal here last year as this team and I think that in a lot of other different scenarios - different head coaches, and quarterbacks and offenses - there\u2019s a lot of examples out there that are very, very similar to what we are going through right now that have turned into pretty, pretty special places,\u201d Bears coach Matt Nagy said.\n\nYet, this was supposed to be Year 2 of Nagy\u2019s offense, the advanced 200-level course for Trubisky and all the players.\n\nInstead, the defense has carried them and made the 16-14 win possible Sunday at Denver. Kicker Eddy Pineiro pulled it out with a 53-yard field goal as time expired.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep doing that, but I like that we\u2019re going through some adversity right now,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cI like that we got the win, I like that it\u2019s mentally callousing us.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s making us mentally tougher and when you can get mentally stronger and still win the game, you figure things out, you stick together, you become a lot stronger in the end and I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now. We\u2019re learning from that.\u201d\n\nWhether the Bears offense learns enough to do damage to the struggling Redskins defense starts with Trubisky, even if he isn\u2019t the entire reason for their struggles.\n\nTrubisky sits near the bottom of all NFL starters with a 65.0 passer rating. His completion rate of 58.3 percent is worse than in both of his first two seasons.\n\nThe Bears\u2019 lone touchdown came on a 1-yard David Montgomery run against Denver.\n\nNevertheless, Trubisky said his confidence remains high.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good, it\u2019s good,\u201d Trubisky said. \u201cYou just gotta believe this week is gonna be the week. So we haven\u2019t been executing the way we want to. There is definitely some things that we are missing on film but we\u2019re coming together and we\u2019re correcting them.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing to me is that my guys still believe in me. I believe in myself and we\u2019re one unit, we\u2019re together\u201d\n\nThe running game started coming together last week. Montgomery gained 62 yards, and they had 153 rushing yards thanks to a 46-yard run around left end by Cordarrelle Patterson.\n\nGuard Kyle Long thinks staying with a block another second or two might open it up for Montgomery.\n\n\u201cHe can make things happen regardless of what happens,\u201d Long said. \u201cBut it\u2019d be better if we can do a little bit more and give him a little bit more daylight.\u201d\n\nThe passing game in Week 1 had been without tight end Trey Burton, a key contributor. He returned from a groin injury a bit wobbly last week and has been gaining strength.\n\nBurton recalled the poor offensive start last year as being similar to this season, as well, and pointed out how they went to Arizona in Week 3 and won 16-14. It wasn\u2019t quite as dramatic as last week\u2019s 16-14 win in Denver, but close.\n\n\u201c(Nagy) reminded us about that a couple times, but the guys that were here know about it,\u201d Burton said. \u201cAll we\u2019ve got to do is win.\u201d\n\nThe Bears went on to a 12-4 record then, but this offense has to indicate it can turn it around as it did last year.\n\n\u201cNone of us are panicking by any means,\u201d Burton said.\n\nNOTES: Starting defensive end Bilal Nichols missed Thursday\u2019s practice with a broken hand suffered in the win over Denver and Nagy said it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll play this week. Nichols will play again at some point this season, possibly with a protective cast on his hand according to Nagy. \u2026 Safety Eddie Jackson (shoulder), guard Kyle Long (hip), tight end Trey Burton (groin) and nose tackle Eddie Goldman (oblique strain) practiced Thursday on a limited basis.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Quarterback Mitchell Trubisky is taking the heat after the Chicago Bears scored only 19 points in the first two games.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gene Chamberlain"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
