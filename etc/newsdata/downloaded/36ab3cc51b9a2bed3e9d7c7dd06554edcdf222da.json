As he was entering a village, ten lepers met him. They stood at a distance from him and raised their voices, saying, \u201cJesus, Master! Have pity on us!\u201d And when he saw them, he said, \u201cGo show yourselves to the priests.\u201d As they were going they were cleansed. And one of them, realizing he had been healed, returned, glorifying God in a loud voice; and he fell at the feet of Jesus and thanked him. He was a Samaritan. Jesus said in reply, \u201cTen were cleansed, were they not? Where are the other nine? Has none but this foreigner returned to give thanks to God?\u201d Then he said to him, \u201cStand up and go; your faith has saved you.\u201d\n\nA while back, we attended a talk with a young priest, and the conversation discussed gratitude. He suggested that our dinner prayers as Catholics were incomplete. Yes, we asked for God\u2019s grace over the food at the beginning, but did we express any gratitude at the end? Did we thank the Lord for the pleasantness of the experience once it was all over?\n\nI\u2019d like to say that stuck with us, but I\u2019ve yet to take his advice. That occurs to me now, along with the joke about the grandmother and the hat, in today\u2019s Mass readings. Today\u2019s Gospel reading is no parable but a recounting of an event in Jesus\u2019 ministry. Ten lepers got healed by Jesus, but only one had the heart to express gratitude for his healing \u2014 and that was a Samaritan rather than a Judean.\n\nThis parallels the story of Naaman from 2 Kings in our first reading, at least to some extent. Naaman was a powerful Syrian general, not only an outsider to the Israelites but an enemy. When he developed leprosy, his servant girl \u2014 an Israelite \u2014 suggested that Naaman seek out the prophet Elisha for healing. In earlier verses from 2 Kings, Naaman wants Elisha himself to perform a magic rite, but Elisha instead sends a messenger to give Naaman a simple task \u2014 merely immerse himself seven times in the Jordan. Naaman becomes angry that Elisha didn\u2019t perform a ritual himself, but is talked into doing what Elisha instructed. When it works, Naaman converts to the Lord and tries repeatedly to reward Elisha, who refuses any compensation.\n\nBoth cases tell actual stories, as opposed to parables, yet both are instructive on the role of faith and of gratitude within it. Leprosy has largely faded from human experience, and medical science has caught up with that which still exists. At that time, though, leprosy was a disease that meant a life sentence of solitude away from everything but other lepers. That meant its sufferers could not worship in the proper manner, as they could never be ritually clean again. It cut them off from family, friends, the entire community out of fear of contagion.\n\nThis is how sin works on us as children of God, too. It is a disease that separates us from the Lord and His family, not by His choice but by ours. Jesus came to heal us of our sins in the same manner in which He heals the ten lepers in this tale, to return us to our family forever.\n\nBut have we become numbed to this? The only one who understood this to be a gift came from outside of the Judean community. The nine Judeans who simply walked away appear to have had no gratitude for this at all, perhaps because they felt they had a right to the healing. In the same manner, we who have the gift of faith and the sacraments can fall easily into the same trap of arrogance and presumption. Rather than forgiveness and grace being gifts of Christ, we start viewing them as birthrights and obligations, and have no gratitude in our hearts when we do receive them.\n\nGratitude is necessary for the full grace and forgiveness of Christ, as this Gospel reading shows. Even in the story of Naaman, it took the Syrian general\u2019s frustrated gratitude to direct him to the Lord. When Elisha refused to accept a gift, Naaman converts to the Lord for the rest of his life instead. Had Elisha taken the reward, Naaman\u2019s gratitude would have fallen in the wrong direction \u2014 toward Elisha rather than God. Naaman\u2019s perseverance in seeing his healing as a gift is what saves him.\n\nPaul writes about the virtue of perseverance in faith to Timothy in our second reading today. \u201cThis saying is trustworthy,\u201d Paul instructs: \u201cIf we have died with him we shall also live with him; if we persevere we shall also reign with him.\u201d Perseverance in faith requires us to remember that our faith is a gift, given to us by the Holy Spirit in order to fight the disease of sin. It\u2019s not too much to ask for a thank you now and again when its power rescues us from sin\u2019s deadly effects.\n\nThe front page image is \u201cCleansing of the ten lepers\u201d from the Codex Aureus Epternacensis, c.1035-1040.
