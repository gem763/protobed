An event could happen tomorrow \u2013 we are saying this, we are saying that for sure, things are on the line.\"\n\nProfessor Edward Fieldhouse of the University of Manchester said: \"Given the UK's recent history of switching and the unpredictability of the current climate, it would be unwise for any political party or commentator to presume how voters will behave in a general election, particularly in the middle of an electoral shock.\n\n\"But we do expect to see big shifts largely defined by Brexit.\"\n\nProfessor Green added: \"We don't what the Brexit situation will be on election day. We don't know who will get the blame for the current political deadlock, or who will benefit.\n\n\"But we do expect there to be clear winners and losers because voters are now more changeable in response to such shock events. A key driver of vote choice will be how competent each party is perceived to be on Brexit.\"\n\nRead more\n\nEU\u2019s Donald Tusk accuses Boris Johnson of playing \u2018stupid blame\u2019\n\nBoris Johnson's Brexit plan in tatters as Merkel personally rejects it\n\nPound plunges as Johnson's Brexit deal plans lay in tatters\n\nRudd ready to back fresh referendum as she attacks 'desperate' Johnson\n\nUK already up to \u00a366bn poorer because of Brexit vote, study shows\n\nGovernment debt set to rocket in event of a no-deal Brexit, IFS warns", "description": "Boris Johnson's push for a general election at the earliest available opportunity is in danger of backfiring, a major new study has indicated.Critics have accused the prime minister of deliberately offering the EU an unpalatable deal in the hope of capitalising on pro-Brexit sentiment to regain a", "authors": ["Ashley Cowburn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.6HWT_N7xdWQQPVfiXPtLQ--~B/aD0zNTA7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/a14da50cf81578b0ad6689d78e52432a", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
