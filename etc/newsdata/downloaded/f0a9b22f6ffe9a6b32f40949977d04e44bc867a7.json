The efforts appear to be part of a broader campaign by Trump\u2019s allies to damage the former Democratic vice president\u2019s White House campaign and have raised questions about whether Trump\u2019s team is trying to enlist a foreign government to aid the president\u2019s re-election bid.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cCertainly it would be an appropriate thing to speak to him about, but I have not done that as of yet. \u2026 It could be a very big situation,\u201d Trump said in a 15-minute telephone interview on Friday afternoon, which stemmed from POLITICO\u2019s inquiries for a separate story.\n\nBarr also drew attention during his recent congressional testimony when he demurred on a question about whether anybody in the White House had ever suggested that he launch an investigation.\n\nThe two Bidens\u2019 connections to Ukraine have become a subject of deep interest among the president\u2019s political allies, who charge that Biden as vice president pressured the Ukrainian government to oust a prosecutor in order to benefit his son. The Ukrainian prosecutor had reportedly faced allegations of ignoring corruption among Ukraine\u2019s business and political elite. No evidence has emerged that Joe Biden was acting to assist his son, and it is not clear that the official was probing the company at the time.\n\nThe New York Times earlier this month reported on Giuliani\u2019s efforts to investigate and publicize the issue.\n\nThe president argued that the alleged conflict of interest, or appearance thereof, was not mushrooming into an all-out scandal because Biden is a Democrat.\n\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s a Democrat,\u201d Trump said, the report had about \u201cone-hundredth\u201d the impact as it would have if he \u201cwere a Republican.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not for lack of effort by the president\u2019s allies. As of Friday afternoon, Giuliani was about to travel to Ukraine in an effort to push the country\u2019s president-elect to pursue the investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s involvement with the energy company, Burisma Holdings. He also wants Ukraine to probe whether the country\u2019s officials were trying to help Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election by releasing forged documents tied to Paul Manafort.\n\nGiuliani was planning to leave Sunday and return Wednesday, he told POLITICO in an interview Friday afternoon. During his trip, Giuliani was expecting to meet with Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian who was elected president of Ukraine last month and who has reportedly said he\u2019s looking to replace one of the prosecutors involved in the cases.\n\n\u201cI just want to tell him, \u2018Don\u2019t let these crooks talk you out of the investigation. There are real facts there they\u2019ve got to investigate,\u2019\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cA lot of this stuff is a lot easier for them to get. They do get nervous if they think the government is going to scuttle this investigation.\u201d\n\nBut later Friday, Giuliani said he had canceled his trip, explaining his change of plans in a text message to POLITICO that the original offer for a meeting was a \u201cset up\u201d orchestrated by \u201cseveral vocal critics\u201d of Trump who are advising Ukraine\u2019s new president-elect. \u201cOnly got name yesterday and told pres elect is in hands of avowed enemies of Pres Trump,\u201d Giuliani wrote. \u201cUseless meeting.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAttorney General Bill Barr has come under fire for his reply to Sen. Kamala Harris when Barr would not say whether President Trump or anyone else in the White House asked or suggested the DOJ launch an investigation. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe president said Friday he didn\u2019t know much about Giuliani\u2019s planned trip but wanted to speak with him about it.\n\n\u201cI have not spoken to him at any great length, but I will,\u201d Trump said in the interview. \u201cI will speak to him about it before he leaves.\u201d\n\nThe former New York mayor for weeks has been talking with reporters about the Biden-Ukraine connection, insisting it is a scandal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how you get from here to the presidency without that being investigated,\u201d Giuliani said earlier on Friday, swinging back at critics who say the president\u2019s attorney is openly encouraging a foreign government to meddle in the American election.\n\n\u201cIf I wanted to meddle in the election, I\u2019d be talking about it a year from now,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cI\u2019d have kept it for myself and I\u2019d have popped it right before the Democratic convention. That\u2019d be fun.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s critics have long feared that the president would pressure the Justice Department to investigate his political opponents.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump and his allies led chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d in reference to Clinton, though there has been no public follow-up on the Clinton investigation since the arrival of the Trump administration.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/2188/1155968404_6036723966001_6036712262001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nMore recently, Barr has come under fire for his reply to Sen. Kamala Harris during a hearing last week where the attorney general did not explicitly answer the California Democrat\u2019s questions about whether Trump or anyone else in the White House asked or suggested the DOJ launch an investigation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to grapple with the world \u2018suggest\u2019,\u201d Barr replied during the hearing. \u201cI mean there have been discussions of, of matters out there that uh \u2026 they have not asked me open an investigation.\u201d\n\nHarris, who is running for president, followed up by asking if the White House had hinted at an investigation, and the attorney general replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSeveral former national security and law enforcement officials took issue later Friday with the president\u2019s comment that he was within his right to approach Barr about a possible Biden investigation.\n\n\u201cPast Republican and Democratic administrations alike have recognized the critical importance of the wall of separation between the White House and DOJ when it comes to criminal investigations,\u201d said Matt Axelrod, a former senior Obama Justice Department official. \u201cThis president\u2019s belief that he can instruct the Attorney General to investigate his political rival is a wild break from past precedent and would represent a dangerous assault on the rule of law.\u201d\n\nSusan Hennessey, a former attorney at the National Security Agency wrote on Twitter after this story published that Trump\u2019s comment was a \u201cdisturbing development people should pay attention to.\u201d", "description": "Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, is urging Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, raising questions about whether Donald Trump would pressure his attorney general to do the same.", "authors": ["Eliana Johnson", "Darren Samuelsohn", "Andrew Restuccia", "Daniel Lippman"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f1/cc/01f49773478abaf6e55427ea4ee3/190510-joe-biden-lede-gty-773.jpg"}
