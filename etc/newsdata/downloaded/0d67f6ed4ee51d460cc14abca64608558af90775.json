Many carried the U.S. flag, and even banners for President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, as they flooded the streets in their thousands chanting \u201cResist Beijing! Liberate Hong Kong!\u201d\n\nThe former British colony\u2019s democracy movement has repeatedly called for foreign intervention in its struggles with Beijing. Earlier on Sunday, a few dozen protesters gathered at the British consulate, waving Union Jacks and singing \u201cGod Save the Queen\u201d as they petitioned Whitehall for assistance.\n\n\u201cI guess this is our last hope,\u201d said 46-year-old marcher Selina, in reference to the appeals to Western powers for support. \u201cMaybe with Trump or American help we can stop the police violence.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

They also tore down and burned a large banner that had been erected to commemorate China\u2019s upcoming national day on Oct. 1.\n\nBy the late afternoon, protesters had set up barricades on Harcourt Road, near the city\u2019s legislature and main government offices. Police responded with tear gas. Protesters also vandalized subway stations, venting their fury at a train operator that they accuse of being in league with the the authorities by transporting riot police to demonstrations but shutting stations when protesters need to leave.\n\nSunday\u2019s demonstrations come after a day of brawls across the city between protesters and pro-Beijing groups, with 25 people brought to hospital. A fire also broke out at the office of a pro-Beijing legislator.\n\nMany protesters have threatened to escalate their campaign if the government does not meet their demands for, among other things, universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into what they say is the heavy handed way police have handled the demonstrations.\n\n\u201cWhen we say thing a quietly and peacefully and it doesn\u2019t work you have to escalate,\u201d Ken, a 46-year-old protester, told TIME. \u201cWe have no choice; give us a better choice.\u201d\n\nSemi-autonomous Hong Kong has been roiled by more than three months of unrest, which began as a series of demonstrations against a now withdrawn extradition bill. The movement quickly escalated into a full blown campaign for genuine democracy, with calls for the city\u2019s leader to be elected by all eligible citizens instead of the small and carefully vetted electoral college that decides the appointment at present.\n\nIn recent weeks, calls for self-determination and even independence for Hong Kong have started to grow, leading a furious Beijing to denounce the protests as a separatist, color revolution.\n\nHong Kong was retroceded to China in 1997, after 156 years of British rule, but it\u2019s 7.2 million people remain culturally and linguistically distinct from mainland Chinese.\n\n\u2014With reporting by Aria Hangyu Chen and Amy Gunia / Hong Kong\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Protesters in Hong Kong once again defied a police ban Sunday to march through the city in their push for greater political freedom.", "authors": ["Time Staff"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/gettyimages-1168276254.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
