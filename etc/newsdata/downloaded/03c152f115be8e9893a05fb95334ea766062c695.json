He\u2019s a proud man so won\u2019t make a big deal of it but I know how much it meant to him.\n\n\u2018We all love him dearly and know how hard these last few years have been for him and his family so just wanted to show that and do what we can.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s always been a man to help others \u2013 through his charity and community work in Keynsham or with City.\n\n\u2018As Roger said to me, \u201cyou judge a man\u2019s true wealth not by how much money he\u2019s got, but by how many friends he has\u201d.\u2019\n\nMr Russell added: \u2018He thought he was just going for a small drink.\n\n\u2018His reaction said it all and we were all choked up by it.\n\n\u2018It was a mark of respect for the man, to see that many people turn out for him.\n\n\u2018We only planned a little gathering but you only have to see the numbers to see what he means to so many people.\n\n\u2018Bristol City is his life. A lot of the players know him. So to have that taken away from him has been really hard for him to take.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
