Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d referring to the 4-month-old protests in the semiautonomous Chinese territory. That set off an immediate backlash, with China\u2019s state broadcaster canceling plans to show a pair of preseason games in that country later this week.\n\nWith a population of 1.4 billion people, a rapidly growing middle class and easing economic restrictions, China is highly appealing to U.S. companies looking for growth overseas. But companies must balance the potential for growth with the potential for pitfalls in dealing with a country that aggressively goes after its detractors.\n\nPaul Argenti, professor of corporate communication at Dartmouth\u2019s Tuck School of Business, cautions that companies should know what they\u2019re getting themselves into when they enter a relationship with a country that\u2019s heading into 70 years of communist rule.\n\n\u201cIt has a regime that doesn\u2019t look like the United States,\u201d Argenti said. \u201cWe can pretend it is a democracy, but it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nWestern governments dislike China\u2019s attacks on companies but are unlikely to get involved, said David Zweig, a politics specialist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. So it\u2019s up to companies to navigate situations themselves.\n\nMost of the time that means companies that face trouble quickly acquiesce to Beijing, apologize and try to \u201cbuild bridges\u201d instead of standing up to China, said Jonathan Sullivan, director of China programs at the University of Nottingham\u2019s Asia Research Institute.\n\nIn 2018, Gap pulled a shirt with a map of China that did not include Taiwan, a self-ruled island that Beijing regards as Chinese territory, and apologized. Delta Air Lines, hotel operator Marriott and fashion brand Zara have all apologized to China for referring to Taiwan, Hong Kong or Tibet as countries on websites or promotional material. And Mercedes-Benz apologized for quoting the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, in a social media post.\n\n\u201cEveryone \u2014 states and companies \u2014 seem to accept that they have to tread on eggshells when it comes to China for fear of offending them and being punished,\u201d Sullivan said in an email. \u201cAnd they have to contort themselves to do that.\u201d\n\nA rare exception of a company standing up to China is Google Inc., but even the internet giant had its limits. Google shut down its mainland Chinese search engine in 2010, no longer willing to enforce Chinese censorship by not displaying foreign websites in search results if they were blocked by government filters. Years later, however, reports surfaced that Google was working on a search engine that complies with China\u2019s censorship laws, dubbed \u201cDragonfly,\u201d leading to an outcry and a protest by hundreds of its own employees.\n\nPeter Petri, a professor of international finance at the Brandeis International Business School, said despite the risks of dealing with China, the country is hard for U.S. businesses to avoid.\n\n\u201cBoth countries have huge economies and are the world\u2019s greatest innovators \u2014 they have too much to sell and license to each other to stay isolated in the long run,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially in high-tech products, China will soon be the largest market in the world, and America\u2019s best companies can\u2019t stay global leaders without a strong presence there.\u201d\n\nChina is well-aware of its power and influence. And while a tweet may seem inconsequential, the Chinese government\u2019s subsequent outrage has a chilling effect on anyone thinking of doing the same, said Alexander Dukalskis, a professor at University College Dublin specializing in Asian politics and human rights.\n\n\u201cIn these episodes, the Chinese government is sending a clear signal to other companies that if you or one of your executives criticize certain policies, your company risks losing large sums of money,\u201d he said.\n\nOver time, companies that want to do business with China learn to censor themselves \u2014 and maybe even their own employees.\n\nUltimately, some companies may find it\u2019s not worth the possibility of alienating U.S. customers or risking Chinese ire by doing business in China, no matter how lucrative the deals may be. Dartmouth\u2019s Argenti says they must consider how their business in China measures up to their own values and sense of responsibility and then decide, \u201cAre you willing to go to the mat for that, or is it just lip service?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor most companies,\u201d Argenti concedes, \u201cit\u2019s just lip service.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP writers Joe McDonald in Beijing and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The furor over a tweet by the Houston Rockets general manager in support of Hong Kong protesters is highlighting the fine line that U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/08/5dd2f2_offending-china-business-91105-in-26-2019-file-photo-traffic-warden-securities-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
