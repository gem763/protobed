None of these aspiring pop stars felt any need to calm down, understandably. But Taylor, one of the best Key Advisers or Mega-Mentors or whatever-you-want-to-call-\u2018em that The Voice has ever had, did her best to make these aspiring singers feel at ease. And clearly she succeeded, when one of Kelly Clarkson\u2019s hopefuls, Melinda Rodriguez, opened up to Taylor about the health struggles of her brother, Chris \u2014 who just so happens to be a mega-Swiftie.\n\nExplaining her decision to sing Mariah Carey\u2019s \u201cAlways Be My Baby\u201d in the Knockouts, Melinda revealed to Taylor through tears, \u201cI picked this song because of my brother. We love to jam out in the car and just listen to old-school jams, and he is your biggest fan. He has every single one of your album names tattooed on his body. \u2026 He was waiting for a heart transplant, and he just got called yesterday, so he's there [at the hospital] right now.\u201d Melinda, who has a Fearless tattoo on her own body to match Chris\u2019s, further explained the reason she\u2019d stayed on the show: \u201cLiterally, he said, \u2018You can't leave, because what if [the Knockout Rounds mentor] is Taylor Swift?\u2019 I'm not even joking right now. .. He was like, \u2018Don't be selfish. You're doing it for me, not for you!\u2019\u201d\n\nTaylor stood there in shock, before asking for an address to send Chris some gifts (Taylor is really good at giving gifts) and demanding that she, Melinda, and Kelly engage in an impromptu group hug. \u201cMelinda told me the most touching story, and it was this really unexpected, beautiful moment,\u201d Taylor gushed.\n\nSadly, Melinda did not win her Knockout, even though Kelly gave her a standing ovation. Vocally, I thought Melinda was evenly matched with her opponent, old-school country belter Jake Hoot \u2014 but while Jake demonstrated a pure and lovely tone that Kelly declared one of the best country voices she\u2019d heard in the history of the series and high taste level by covering Jason Isbell\u2019s \u201cCover Me Up,\u201d but he lacked stage presence. Taylor had even pointed out and try to correct his distracting tendency to agitatedly sway from side to side. Meanwhile, Melinda\u2019s breezy, jazzy take on the Mariah ballad was, despite her heavy backstory, full of joy, and she seemed calm and confident onstage. I was certain that one of the rival coaches \u2014 probably jazzbo John Legend \u2014 would steal this talented song stylist, but instead, Melinda was shockingly eliminated. Now it was my turn to make a GIFable surprised-face.\n\nStill, Melinda did Taylor \u2014 and, more importantly, her brother \u2014 proud. And now Melinda is reunited with Chris, who underwent successful surgery perhaps buoyed by the strength of having a new direct connection to his idol. \u201cWhile I'm super-bummed that I couldn't continue on in the show, I just wanted to let you all know that Chris has since gotten his second heart transplant and is slowly recovering. Thank you to The Voice. This whole experience has been just unlike any other,\u201d Melinda said in a follow-up video message to Taylor and the show.\n\nBefore Taylor showed up in the second hour of Monday\u2019s show to share her wisdom and good vibes, however the Battle Rounds concluded. This was followed by a few other Knockouts. The disjointed formatting made Taylor\u2019s mid-episode appearance all the more jolting and dramatic, but let\u2019s go through it all chronologically. Then get ready to party like it\u2019s 1989 all over again on Tuesday\u2019s all-Taylor, all-Knockouts, one-hour eposide.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Tears and group hugs ensued when one contestant revealed that she was only there because of Taylor \u2014 and because of her ailing brother.", "authors": ["Lyndsey Parker", "Editor-In-Chief"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nzBsNrEBaHHwoG8rSqmzYQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/b0a0e830-fa00-11e9-bede-f1b157fc5c27", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
