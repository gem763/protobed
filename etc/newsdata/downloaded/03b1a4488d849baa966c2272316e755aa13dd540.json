Willian obviously is reborn as well but try thinking of someone in the group that isn\u2019t giving everything for every moment, it is impossible.\n\n\u2018Tammy Abraham works until his legs run out and is often replaced but that is a positive sign that he is giving everything, not a negative one that he is playing badly.\n\n\u2018There looks as though there are two Mason Mounts on the field most weeks as he seems to have the ability to turn up everywhere. On top of that have a look at the attitude of those coming off the bench. None of the subs are giving anything less than everything they have, whether it is for 30 minutes or 10.\u2019\n\nThe Blues have the chance to extend their winning run when they host Newcastle at Stamford Bridge on Saturday afternoon.\n\nAbraham and Mount will return from their international duty with England and look to keep their impressive goal-scoring seasons going with Abraham the joint top-scorer in the Premier League with eight goals and Mount netting four times from midfield.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Chelsea winger Christian Pulisic in tears after being substituted in USA\u2019s defeat to Canada\n\nMORE: Michael Owen makes his predictions for Arsenal and Chelsea\u2019s Premier League clashes", "description": "Former Chelsea winger Pat Nevin has picked out Jorginho and Willian as two players vastly improved under Frank Lampard, while also praising the work-rates of Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount....", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177685810_1571232699.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
