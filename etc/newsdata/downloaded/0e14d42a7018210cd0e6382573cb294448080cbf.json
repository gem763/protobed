Larsen was the sixth man to be red-carded at the Rugby World Cup in Japan, which was already the worst tournament for reds.\n\nThe way the Springboks started really took us by surprise. Pace, physicality, we couldn't stay with it. \u2014 Canada coach Kingsley Jones\n\nCanada was 40-0 down when Larsen went five minutes before halftime.\n\nFacing what threatened to be the biggest beating of the World Cup so far, the red card seemed to lift Canada for a period and the underdogs fought gamely in a 20-minute spell either side of halftime.\n\nThe Springboks only scored one try in that period and Canada won a sliver of pride when flanker Matt Heaton drove over early in the second \u2014 when it was 14 vs. 15 \u2014 for its one try. It easily drew the biggest cheer at Kobe's last game of the World Cup.\n\n\"The way the Springboks started really took us by surprise,\" Canada coach Kingsley Jones said. \"Pace, physicality, we couldn't stay with it.\n\n\"There was a lot of thinking to do there in the sheds. We talked about the [first] 40 minutes had gone, there wasn't a lot we could do about that 40 minutes. I thought the boys fought admirably in the second half with 14 players.\"\n\nThe Springboks scored 10 tries in all. Backline players scored all seven in the first half and eight of the 10 as the Boks ran the Canadians off their feet at times. But Canada also reduced the two-time champions to just three tries in the second. That half finished 19-7 to South Africa.\n\nReinach takes control\n\nThe humidity and the greasy ball under a closed roof at Kobe Misaki Stadium may have contributed to the slow down.\n\nCentre Damian de Allende breezed through in the third minute for the first try for South Africa, which started with 13 reserve players. Wing Sbu Nkosi was in on the left for the second in the sixth.\n\nReinach, South Africa's third-choice No. 9, scored two scorchers. He broke, raced away, chipped over fullback Andre Coe and collected with a little juggle for his first. He finished a move from inside South Africa's 22 for his hat trick, when Elton Jantjies dropped a crosskick over Canada's backline, wing Warrick Gelant caught it and broke, and fed de Allende who found Reinach to race away and finish between the posts.\n\nIn between, Reinach sniped over from close range.\n\n\"The moment he sniffs some space he's got exceptional speed,\" Erasmus said.\n\nReinach was told he had the record after he was replaced in the second half, job done.\n\nCanadians trailed 47-0 at halftime\n\n\"I was just happy with the tries. I was trying to get my heartrate down so I wasn't counting anything,\" he said. \"We went into the game with the mindset of how we want to play going forward.\n\n\"We delivered quite well in the first half. We let it slip a little bit [in the second half].\"\n\nGelant and centre Frans Steyn also scored in the first half.\n\nThe Canadians were conceding far worse than a point a minute for the first 30 minutes and were 47-0 behind at halftime.\n\nHooker Schalk Brits side-stepped his way in on his 38-year-old legs to get South Africa rolling again in the second, but only 15 minutes into the half. Fullback Damian Willemse, called up to the squad as an injury replacement, scored his first test try from a set move and a flicked pass from Steyn, and prop Malherbe ground over for the last.\n\nThe Boks weren't as rampant in the second half, though, underlining the gutsy work by Canada after losing Larsen.\n\nSouth Africa is set to play either Ireland, Scotland or host Japan in the quarters when that pool is decided.\n\nCanada faces its moment of truth against fellow Tier Two team Namibia on Sunday. Both are winless, have been battered by some big scores by the Springboks and All Blacks, but can still leave with a World Cup victory.", "description": "Cobus Reinach scored the quickest Rugby World Cup hat trick in a whirlwind first 30 minutes from South Africa to demolish 14-man Canada 66-7 on Tuesday.
