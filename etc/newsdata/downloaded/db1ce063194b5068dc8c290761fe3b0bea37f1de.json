You saw Faf de Klerk do 15-20 box kicks in the game. We know they can play differently but we also know that they are going to come through the front door. There are not many Springbok teams that don\u2019t come through the front door. So we\u2019ve got to be ready at the front door and have enough cover at the back door too.\u201d\n\nJones said his main role this week was to keep his players relaxed and not try to over-supply them with information, but that is unlikely to apply to scrumhalf Ben Spencer, who arrived in Japan on Monday ready to go straight on to the bench in the World Cup final in place of the injured Willi Heinz.\n\nSpencer has played a total of 20 minutes of international rugby via three late replacement appearances - the first two against South Africa on last year\u2019s June tour and the last against Scotland in March.\n\n\u201cBen has been in and around the squad consistently for the last couple of years so he knows the game, he knows the players,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a great opportunity ahead of him. He has come into the squad and has got to learn a few new things. He\u2019s just got to learn a little bit more in the early part of the week and get himself physically and mentally ready.\u201d\n\nJones said that both Jonny May and Owen Farrell were recovering well from the dead legs they received in Saturday\u2019s win over New Zealand and expected both to be fit to play. He will name his team for the final on Thursday, with prop Kyle Sinckler the other main injury concern.", "description": "Eddie Jones says England are bracing themselves for a massive physical assault from South Africa in Saturday's World Cup final but added that he expected the odd twist too from the Springboks after they won a turgid semi-final against Wales on Sunday.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445750142&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0CQ", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
