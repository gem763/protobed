Therefore, we hope the United States will take up its responsibility in Syria again.\u201d\n\nEngel has previously condemned Trump\u2019s withdrawal and Turkey\u2019s invasion, authoring a House-passed resolution opposing the moves and a bill that would impose sanctions on Turkey. But releasing a joint statement with foreign counterparts is unusual for a House member.\n\nThe statement was co-signed by David McAllister, chairman of the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs; Norbert Rottgen, chairman of the German Bundestag Committee on Foreign Affairs; Marielle de Sarnez, chairwoman of the French National Assembly Committee on Foreign Affairs; and Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the U.K. House of Commons Committee on Foreign Affairs\n\nTrump has faced widespread backlash for his decision withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, paving the way for NATO ally Turkey to move forward with a long-threatened offensive against Syrian Kurdish forces.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision has been condemned as abandoning the Kurds, who were instrumental in the U.S.-led fight against ISIS, and allowing a chaos in which ISIS will resurge.\n\nOn Monday, Trump defended his decision by saying \u201cwe never agreed to protect the Kurds.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe supported them for 3 1/2, four years. We never agreed to protect the Kurds for the rest of their lives,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cWhere's an agreement that said we have to say in the Middle East for the rest of humanity, for the rest of civilization to protect the Kurds? It never said that.\"\n\nIn their statement, Engel and his counterparts called the \u201cabandonment\u201d of the Kurds \u201cwrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Syrian Democratic Forces, our partner in the Global Coalition, massively contributed to the successful yet unfinished fight against Da\u2019esh in Syria and incurred heavy losses by doing so,\u201d they said, using an Arabic acronym for ISIS.\n\nThe statement also called on the European Union and its member states to \u201ctake responsibility and engage in the conflict resolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis horrible war touches and affects the peoples of our countries in such an enormous way,\u201d they said. \u201cFor that reason, we, as members of our parliaments, feel compelled to making our common position clear. We unite across parties and nationalities to demonstrate our commitment to our common values, responsibility and interests.\u201d", "description": "The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee released a joint statement Monday with several of his European counterparts condemning Turkey\u2019s invasion of northern Syria and expressing \u201cregret\u201d at President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/engelelliot_062719as_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
