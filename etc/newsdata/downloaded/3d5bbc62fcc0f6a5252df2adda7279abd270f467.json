He had become increasingly desperate to flee his hideout on the Syrian-Iraqi border before American special forces caught him closer to the Syria-Turkey border, near Idlib, but he \u201cdidn\u2019t know how\u201d to relocate.\n\n\u201cHe was in an eight-meter long underground tunnel with a width of five to six meters.

Another fellow aide, Ismael Ethawi, also provided vital information that led to his assassination.\n\n\u201cEthawi gave valuable information which helped the Iraqi multi-security agencies team complete the missing pieces of the puzzle of Baghdadi\u2019s movements and places he used to hide,\u201d an Iraqi security official told Reuters. \u201c[He] gave us details on five men, including him, whom were meeting Baghdadi inside Syria and the different locations they used.\u201d\n\nIn a televised statement from the White House on Sunday morning, Trump announced that al-Baghdadi had \u201cdied like a dog [and a] coward,\u201d declaring that the world would now be a \u201cmuch safer place.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast night, the United States brought the world\u2019s number one terrorist leader to justice,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead.
