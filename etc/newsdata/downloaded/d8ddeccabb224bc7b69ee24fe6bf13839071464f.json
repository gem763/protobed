I thought the substitutions of [Alex] Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lallana and [Naby] Keita just gave them a bit of impetus in terms of energy and United didn\u2019t make the substitutions,\u2019 Neville told Optus Sport.\n\n\u2018They brought Martial on\u2026 I thought maybe just five or ten minutes too late to change the momentum. You could see that United were camped in.\n\n\u2018I agree with Ryan\u2026 I don\u2019t know what Rojo was doing for the goal. He had no need to go ahead of the other centre-back, he stays in his slot and he picks up Lallana.\n\n\u2018But I thought it was an outstanding performance from United. Full of energy, they played a more direct style and at the end the fans were dead because of the effort the players put in.\n\n\u2018They didn\u2019t get their just rewards.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nNeville added: \u2018Tactically, Ole got it really spot on today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Five at the back, they defended the middle of the pitch really well, the three centre-backs in particular defended the goal really well, every cross that came in from wide areas they were set.\n\n\u2018Just that cross at the end when it gets fired across the box. Rojo just lost a little bit of concentration and it got punished.\n\n\u2018Liverpool did finish really strong and United will feel like that\u2019s two points dropped.\u2019\n\nLiverpool players were adamant that Divock Origi was fouled by Victor Lindelof in the build-up to Rashford\u2019s goal, but Solskjaer wasn\u2019t having any of it.\n\nNo chance\u2026 we\u2019re not playing basketball,\u2019 Solskjaer said.\n\n\u2018He touched him but it\u2019s not a clear and obvious error. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a foul.\u2019\n\nSolskjaer was delighted with United\u2019s performance against league leaders Liverpool (Picture: Getty)\n\nSolskjaer hopes his players use their promising display as a springboard for the season after a poor start to the 2019/20 campaign.\n\n\u2018We are better when he attack quickly, no dilly-dallying on the ball,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Playing the ball forward doesn\u2019t have to be a counter attack but you need to be more direct, take more risks, be braver.\n\n\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter if you lose the ball up there because you can win it back. Being more direct helped us.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nMORE: Coleen Rooney finally breaks silence amid WAG war with Rebekah Vardy", "description": "Phil Neville believes Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer got his tactics 'spot on' against Liverpool - but feels Anthony Martial should have been introduced sooner at Old Trafford.
