As Lewis said, it's difficult for us to get acceptance from the outside because we don't have the smallest footprint.\n\n\"The races happen around the world, we have to travel so it's part of our jobs. But in general, F1 should do more. It's a worldwide operating platform, and I think we should send a much stronger message.\n\n\"I think everybody can do something. Contribute a little bit. If the whole world acted like that it would be a huge difference.\n\n\"I think it is inevitable that change is coming, hopefully sooner rather than later.\n\nPerez also shared Hamilton's concerns and supported him for using his social platforms to help raise awareness.\n\n\"It's very important to raise our voices, a lot of people hear us,\" Perez added.\n\n\"Especially someone like Lewis it's very important. I see the messages he sends often on social media are good.\n\n\"A lot of people are following him. If we can impact the world, help a bit, we are obliged to do so. I don't see anything wrong with that.\"\n\nAlexander Albon, also part of the press conference, added: \"What Lewis said was really good. Just because we're in Formula 1 doesn't mean we can't care about the environment.", "description": "Sebastian Vettel has leapt to the defence of Lewis Hamilton saying F1 should do more to reduce its carbon footprint.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8127/11bbc302abe34c74b4a1be3449874012.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
