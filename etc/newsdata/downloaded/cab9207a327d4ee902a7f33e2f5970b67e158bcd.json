The tailback missed practice this week due to a quad injury that he sustained in last week\u2019s loss to the Seattle Seahawks.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doubtful right now, so we\u2019ll have a little bit more clarity [before the game]. We\u2019re really just taking our time making that decision,\u201d McVay said. \u201cWhat you know is you\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in Malcolm Brown and Darrell Henderson.\u201d\n\nGurley led the NFL in scrimmage yards (6,430) from 2015-18, but injuries have derailed the running back. This season, he ranks 53rd with 338 yards from scrimmage and is averaging career lows in rushing yards per game (54), touches per game (15.6) and carries per game (12.8).\n\nIn Gurley\u2019s absence, the Rams are expected to utilize the combo of Malcolm Brown and rookie Darrell Henderson.\n\nMcVay also announced that starting cornerback Aqib Talib was ruled out for Sunday\u2019s matchup because of a rib injury. Troy Hill is expected to step into Talib\u2019s role.", "description": "Oct. 11 (UPI) \u2014 The Los Angeles Rams will likely be without star running back Todd Gurley for Sunday\u2019s matchup against the undefeated San", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
