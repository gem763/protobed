USA TODAY\n\nFacebook CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday that he's creating an independemt oversight board for people to turn to, to appeal Facebook's content decisions.\n\nIn a public livestream from Georgetown University Thursday, he spoke of the increase in laws and regulations around the world that he said would undermine free expression and human rights.\n\n\"I\u2019m committed to the values we\u2019re discussing today, but we won\u2019t always get it right. I understand people are concerned that we have so much control over how they communicate on our services,\" Zuckerberg said during his 35-minute speech. \"Frankly, I don\u2019t think we should be making so many important decisions about speech on our own either. We\u2019d benefit from a more democratic process, clearer rules for the internet, and new institutions.\"\n\nFacebook Portal: Facebook's new Portal makes good video calls but still has issues\n\nWarren targets Facebook with false ad:: Elizabeth Warren says in ad that Zuckerberg endorsed Trump\n\nZuckerberg said the board \"will have the power to make final binding decisions about whether content stays up or comes down on our services \u2013 decisions that our team and I can\u2019t overturn.\"\n\nHe said board members will have a \"diversity of views and backgrounds, but who each hold free expression as their paramount value.\"\n\nZuckerberg also gave examples of times when free expression was at risk including the Civil Rights movement and World War I. He said it was another time of \"social tension.\"\n\n\"We face real issues that will take a long time to work through \u2013 massive economic transitions from globalization and technology, fallout from the 2008 financial crisis, and polarized reactions to greater migration,\" he said. \"Many of our issues flow from these changes.\"\n\nZuckerberg said it's a \"popular impulse is to pull back from free expression\" and said we're at another cross-roads.\n\n\"We can continue to stand for free expression, understanding its messiness, but believing that the long journey towards greater progress requires confronting ideas that challenge us,\" he said. \"Or we can decide the cost is simply too great. I\u2019m here today because I believe we must continue to stand for free expression.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/17/facebook-ceo-announces-creation-independent-oversight-board/4010346002/", "description": "In a public livestream, Mark Zuckerberg spoke of the threats to free expression and human rights around the world.", "authors": ["Kelly Tyko", "Published P.M.
