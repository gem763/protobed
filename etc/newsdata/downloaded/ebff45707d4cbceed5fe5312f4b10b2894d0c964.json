The Telegraph recently rated it as one of the cheapest European cities.\n\nThe Airbnb I stayed in was around \u20ac66 per night ($72) \u2014 split with my friend over the course of three nights, I ended up paying just under \u20ac100 ($110). There was a double bed and a bunk bed \u2014 if a group of four went, the Airbnb would have been even cheaper.\n\nFood and drink were relatively cheap, too. I typically paid less than \u20ac10 ($11) for dinner or lunch and around \u20ac1 to \u20ac4 for breakfast, depending on how many baked goods I wanted that morning. And, according to Numbeo, the standard domestic beer in Lisbon is just \u20ac2 (about $2.20)\n\nLisbon is relatively affordable.

We asked 20-somethings for their best travel tips \u2014 from fairy-tale castles to buzzing nightlife, here's what they said.\n\nThat's not to mention the package you can get with the Lisboa card, which grants you access to all of Lisbon's public transportation (metro, bus, train, and trams, including travel for day trips to nearby Sintra and Cascais) as well as free access to many of the city's main museums and attractions.\n\nThe bundle is just \u20ac20 ($22) for 24 hours, \u20ac34 ($37) for 48 hours, and \u20ac42 ($46) for 72 hours. The city is big and hilly, so the card ends up being a good way to experience all parts of the city quickly and affordably.\n\nThat Lisbon is affordable is a big plus for millennials, who are often boot-strapped when it comes to money and likely traveling on a budget.\n\nLisbon offers an endless array of eating and drinking\n\nLisbon's nightlife is vibrant, but it's not like the heart-pumping clubs of Ibiza and Berlin. With streets and alleys and riverfronts teeming with bars, the going-out scene is more of a slow burn that simmers throughout the night.\n\nIt's chill, lively, and fun \u2014 a universal appeal no matter how you prefer your night out.\n\nLisbon has an equally thriving restaurant scene. The city is a gastronomic haven for millennials, who have been dubbed \"the foodie generation\" by Alyssa Modos for Spoon University. According to Anna Peele for Bon App\u00e9tit, millennials spend more than other generations on restaurants.\n\nViews from Lim\u00e3o Rooftop Bar. Hillary Hoffower\n\nThe city boasts eight Michelin-starred restaurants, like the Jos\u00e9 Avillez- run Belcanto, according to Time Out. But it also has a wide range of other restaurants that are authentic, modern, and tasty: There's the Time Out Market and LX Factory, indoor and outdoor spaces, respectively, that have food options for days.\n\nAnd the city has signature flavors, too. Consider Pasteis de Nata, a Portuguese custard tart dusted with cinnamon, or Ginga, a Portuguese cherry liqueur that originated in the city.\n\nRead more: Millennials are treating themselves to experiences \u2014 but it doesn't mean they're bad with money\n\nA city of hills, Lisbon also has rooftops from which to soak in the views while enjoying some food or drink: There's the Lim\u00e3o Rooftop Bar, Topo, and PARK. A quick Instagram scroll shows just how much millennials love a good vantage point that's both fun and photogenic \u2014 which brings me to my next point.\n\nLisbon is made for Instagram\n\nMillennials want to post something on Instagram that shows they've been somewhere different.\n\nLisbon may not boast the paradise-like shots of Southeast Asia, but it is certainly still (highly) Instagrammable. And it's full of winding streets and surprising, photographable nooks that make it seem \u2014 to their social media followers, at least \u2014 like they've been somewhere totally different from the rest of their peers.\n\nLisbon's architecture is very photogenic. Hillary Hoffower\n\nLisbon's walls and alleys, ceramic tiles and pastel paints all beg to be photographed in all their colorful glory. I spent a morning getting lost in the streets of Alfama, the heart of Lisbon, and found myself stopping every other minute to capture striking tile patterns and facades.\n\nWalls also become canvases in Lisbon. Alfama, Bel\u00e9m, and Chiado are home to some wild and amazing street art, in which graphics and colors combine into vivid, one-of-a-kind masterpieces \u2014 the perfect recipe for an Insta double-tap.\n\nUltimately, Lisbon gives millennials an experience \u2014 which is their favorite thing to spend money on, after all. And the fact that it makes for some beautiful photos on their social feeds only strengthens its appeal.", "description": "Lisbon, Portugal, is the top travel destination for millennials.
