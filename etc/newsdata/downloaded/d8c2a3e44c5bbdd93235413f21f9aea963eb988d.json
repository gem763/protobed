First planned as a vigil, the gathering became a demonstration as residents demanded justice for the 28-year-old victim.\n\nParticipants held candles and chanting: \"No justice, no peace.\" Like Jefferson's family, many called for the officer to be fired and criminally prosecuted.\n\n\"State sanctioned violence has always been a culture for black people,\" said protester Michelle Andersen, at Sunday's gathering. \"It's not about a training issue.\"\n\nFort Worth Mayor Betsy Price was present at the vigil, but left after she was approached by protesters shouting \"lock him up\", in reference to the unidentified officer, CBS News reported.\n\nImage copyright Facebook\n\nWhat happened Saturday?\n\nThe shooting happened at about 02:30 local time (07:30 GMT) on Saturday.\n\nThe body cam footage of the incident shows police searching the perimeter of Jefferson's property, before noticing a figure at the window. After demanding that the person put their hands up, an officer then fired through the glass.\n\nMs Jefferson had been playing video games with her eight-year-old nephew before she went to investigate the noise outside the window and was shot, said a lawyer representing her family.\n\nThe officers involved did not park their marked cars in front of her house and did not identify themselves as police, officials said.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Footage shows moment officer shoots woman through bedroom window\n\nThe man who called police, James Smith, 62, told local media he was trying to be a good neighbour.\n\n\"If I had never dialled the police department, she'd still be alive.\" Mr Smith told local media. \"It makes you not want to call the police department.\"\n\nThe officer is expected to be interviewed by the police department's major case unit on Monday.\n\nAnother tragedy in Dallas\n\nJefferson's murder comes two weeks after Dallas police officer Amber Guyger, 31, was found guilty of murdering 26-year-old Botham Jean.\n\nLast year Guyger shot and killed Jean as he sat eating ice cream on his apartment sofa, less than 35 miles (55km) from Saturday's incident. Guyger testified she mistakenly thought she was in her own flat and believed Jean to be an intruder.\n\nAt trial, Guyger admitted to shooting \"an innocent man\".\n\n\"This is a victory for black people in America,\" said Mr Merritt - the lawyer who is also representing Jefferson's family. \"Police officers are going to be held accountable for their actions.\"", "description": "The victim was playing video games at home with her nephew as police entered and opened fire.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07r17pn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
