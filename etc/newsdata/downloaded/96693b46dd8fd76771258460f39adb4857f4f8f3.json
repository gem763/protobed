I also believe it\u2019s a very good deal for our friends in the EU.\n\n\u2018We can come out of the EU as one United Kingdom. We can decide our future together, we can take back control of our money and our laws and be able to do free trade agreements around the world.\n\n\u2018We can build now, after three and a half years, on our relations with our friends and partners in the EU.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It will be a very exciting period now to get to the positive side of that project.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018I am very confident that when my colleagues in parliament study this agreement, that they will want to vote for it on Saturday.\n\n\u2018This is our chance as democrats to get Brexit done and come out on October 31.\n\n\u2018It has been long, painful and divisive. Now is the moment for us as a country to come together and get this thing done and to begin building a new and progressive partnership with our EU friends.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a very good case for MPs across the Commons to respect the democratic view of the people. I don\u2019t think there is any case for delay.\u2019\n\nHis press conference follows comments made by Donald Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker and Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar.\n\nThe EU said we would always be welcome to come back (Picture: Reuters)\n\nMr Tusk said the key change was Mr Johnson\u2019s acceptance to have customs checks at the point of entry into Northern Ireland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This compromise will allow us to avoid border checks between Ireland and Northern Ireland and will ensure the integrity of the single market. \u2018The reality is that today we have a deal which allows us to avoid chaos and an atmosphere of conflict between the EU 27 and the United Kingdom,\u2019 he said.\n\nHe added: \u2018On a personal note, I feel sadness because I will always be a Remainer. I hope our British friends decide to return one day. Our door will always be open.\u2019\n\nIrish prime minister Leo Varadkar told the press conference that he had mixed feelings towards the end of negotiations. He said he was happy there would be no hard border between the north and south of Ireland \u2013 but regretful that Britain had chosen to go its separate ways.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018I have learned two things about the EU while Taoiseach,\u2019 he said. \u2018The strength of the unity of the EU, how much we can achieve if the 27 work together with common objectives, a truly powerful force for good in the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs the leader of a small nation I have felt enormous solidarity from my European partners, and I think it\u2019s been demonstrated in the past few years is a union of peoples and one in which small states are protected.\n\n\u2018I have mixed feelings today, I regret the UK is leaving but respect the decision to do so, like an old friend going on a journey without us, and we really hope it works out for them. There will always be a place at the table for them if they ever want to come back.\n\nPresident of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (R) and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson shake hands during a press conference today (Picture: EPA)\n\nThe decision now moves to the House of Commons for them to consider the agreement.\n\nMPs now have two days to mull over the content of the new deal before a vote on Saturday.\n\nHowever, Mr Johnson faces an uphill struggle as the DUP, Labour, the SNP and Lib Dems have all said they cannot support the new deal.\n\nThe EU Parliament will also need to ratify the agreement.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
