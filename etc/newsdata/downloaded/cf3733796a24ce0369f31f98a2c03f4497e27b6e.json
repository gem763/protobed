We did everything they don\u2019t like at high speed, scored the three goals and could have scored more.\n\n\u201cThen the Salzburg system changed and we lost the ball so that caused us problems,\u201d said the German.\n\n\u201cThe momentum changed and it was really difficult to get a foot in the game. We changed for some reason the approach a little bit. Some (players) were in a controlling mode, some in an attacking mode. Some were too hectic,\u201d he added.\n\nStill, after losing their opening game at Napoli, Klopp was pleased his team found the resolve to get the three points,\n\n\u201cIt was a very important lesson for us to learn. Now we won 4-3, learnt from it and so I am fine. I knew before we have to improve and now everyone knows. We made it more intense than necessary. Three points, game on and now recover,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was far away from being a perfect game but it was a typical Liverpool game \u2014 very exciting,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI thought after the game I am angry but really I am not angry. I respect the performance of the opponent. We can do better. We will do better,\u201d he said.\n\nSalzburg\u2019s Marsch was clearly pleased with the way his team had taken on the Premier League leaders, who had not lost at home in Europe or the domestic league since April, 2017.\n\n\u201cWe spoke before the game that if we played well we had a chance. I think that the biggest learning point is we can play in these games, in these stadiums. If we play our game we always have a chance. We must learn and become better,\u201d Marsch said.\n\n\u201cThey have so much quality. It is a very new experience for our team and for me also. It is no simple but I think we have learned a lot for the next occasion\u201d.", "description": "Liverpool almost paid the price, in embarrassing fashion, for taking their foot off the gas as they let a three-goal lead slip against Salzburg at Anfield on Wednesday but manager Juergen Klopp said he felt no anger after this team's 4-3 win.", "authors": ["Simon Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436428845&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911XZ"}
