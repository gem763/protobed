With promises of helping you get smoother, plumper skin, we take a deep dive into why this magic potion works so well - and reveal how it can help get your bounce back.\n\nLuckily for us, it couldn't be easier to add the ingredient to your regime with L'Or\u00e9al Paris Revitalift Filler Replumping Ampoules to your beauty regime. And the best bit? It promises results in just 7 days.\n\nSo, here's everything you need to know about this perfect, potent skincare hero...\n\nDoes your skin need a boost? Hyaluronic Acid could be the answer - and thanks to the new Revitalift Filler Replumping Ampoules - loved by Eva Longoria (above) - your skin can look younger, plumper and hydrated in just 7 days\n\nSo what makes Hyaluronic Acid so effective?\n\nBecause it\u2019s already there. One of the reasons Hyaluronic Acid works so well is because it\u2019s simply boosting what is already present in your skin.\n\nOur skin naturally produces Hyaluronic Acid to maintain hydration. However, factors including daily wear and tear, age and UV rays means our naturally occurring levels are diminished - leaving skin tired, uneven and dehydrated.\n\nAnd while dry skin can cause cracks and peeling, dehydrated skin is wholly different.\n\nWhen our skin is deprived of moisture - due in part to diminishing levels of our naturally-occurring Hyaluronic Acid - lines and wrinkles appear and skin is left looking dull and lacklustre.\n\nOne molecule of Hyaluronic Acid can retain a whopping 1,000 times its weight in water, while one gram can hold up to six litres of water.\n\nThis means when the acid is applied, it draws water from the skin to provide that flawless complexion we all crave.\n\nIt works to replenish what we lose and provides youthful, plump and smooth skin within just days of kicking off your renewed skincare regime.\n\nIt creates a moisture barrier, which in turn leads to softer skin and because we all have it, it's suitable for everyone - even those with sensitive skin.\n\nTherefore, this little wonder helps to reduce inflammation and maintain our skin\u2019s moisture and natural bounce. We're simply giving nature a helping hand!\n\nThe 7-day supply of ampoules are perfect for replumping your skin before a big event, turning back the clock on dehydrated skin or to just give you a boost\n\nWhat makes Revitalift ampoules so different?\n\nWith so little time on our hands and such busy lives, we need things that work, fast - especially when it comes to our beauty regimes.\n\nThat's why L'Or\u00e9al Paris' Hyaluronic Acid is different. This product contains their highest concentration of this super ingredient, meaning you get an instant boost over 7 days and the results speak for themselves!\n\nThis works because the science whizzes at L'Or\u00e9al Paris have split the concentrate into two different molecular sizes, so it can act on all layers of the epidermis.\n\nOne is smaller, meaning it can easily penetrate the skin's layers and tackle deeper set lines.\n\nWhat is an ampoule? *What is it? An ampoule is basically a little glass or plastic container used to hold powerful concentrations of ingredients. The ampoules are hermetically sealed, allowing the formula to only come into contact with air once it is opened, which allows it to hold higher concentrations of the ingredients without any additives, fragrance or alcohol. * When do I use it? Because of its high concentration, ampoules act like a booster or a shot to achieve an intense result in a short period of time. They should only be used for a short period of time (7 days) when your skin is in need of a boost, feeling dull and lacklustre or leading up to an important event. * How do I use it? Ampoules should be used after cleansing and before your daily moisturising regime. You should use 1 every day for 7 days to achieve best results. * Why is it essential to my regime The ingredients in ampoules are highly concentrated and give your skin the boost it needs. They should be used only as a booster, not every day.\n\nThe other is bigger and so stays on the surface, helping the skin retain its moisture.\n\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris\u2019 Global Scientific Communications Director, Elisabeth Bouhadana, explains: 'Each ampoule contains pure Hyaluronic Acid obtained by biotechnology in two different molecular sizes to produce a complementary action.\n\n'('It's) enriched with soothing Vitamin B5 and free of alcohol, colourant and fragrance. This formula is ideal for even sensitive skin.\u2019\n\nWhen does my skin need the ampoules and how should I use them?\n\nHyaluronic Acid ampoules are best used when your skin is in desperate need of a boost or you when you want to replump, hydrate and moisturise the skin from within - quickly.\n\nA perk of the individual dose packaging means you can use the product on the go and get that boost - and they are all fully recyclable.\n\nAhead of travelling make sure you pack your ampoules so you can apply while you\u2019re in the air. This helps your skin retain the moisture you lose from the air in the plane due to pressure and air conditioning.\n\nUsing a course of ampoules to prepare for a big event can work to plump up and revitalise and ensure you achieve a smooth and fresh face on the big day!\n\nFor an intense treatment akin to a facial, use the ampoules for 7 consecutive days to ensure you get maximum impact from the hydrating icon.\n\nIncorporate the 7-day SOS system into your regime today by ordering your L'Or\u00e9al Paris Revitalift Filler Replumping Ampoules HERE or from your local Boots store...", "description": "When it comes to beauty ingredients that actually mean business, experts and influencers alike have one response: Hyaluronic Acid.", "authors": ["Ciara Farmer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/11/19534580-0-image-a-7_1570704406948.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
