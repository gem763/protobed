The report also highlighted issues about cybersecurity, taxation, and privacy.\n\n\u201cThe G7 believes that no global stablecoin project should begin operation until the legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks\u201d are addressed, the task force, chaired by European Central Bank board member Benoit Coeure, said.\n\n\u201cPrivate sector entities that design stablecoin arrangements are expected to address a wide array of legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks,\u201d the report adds.\n\nThe Libra Association has long said it\u2019s willing to work with regulators, a line which was re-emphasised in the aftermath of G7\u2018s concerns.\n\nA statement said Libra was designed to respect national sovereignty over monetary policy, and rules against money laundering and other efforts to stop illegal financing.\n\n\u201cLibra is being designed to work with existing regulatory institutions and apply the protections they provide to the digital world \u2013 not disrupt, or undermine, them,\u201d it said.\n\nThe ball is truly in the regulators\u2019 court, they have the power to help the \u2018cryptocurrency\u2018 launch, or kill it before it does.\n\nFor the most part, Facebook will have to play nice.", "description": "Earlier this week I told you Facebook's 'cryptocurrency' saga had turned into a soap opera and that it was going to be a long season, and it seems I wasn't wrong.", "authors": ["Yessi Bello Perez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FUntitled-design-96.jpg&signature=4f0a671c8dba299076d10c08eea575e6", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
