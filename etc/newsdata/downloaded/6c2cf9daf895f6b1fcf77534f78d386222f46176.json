Many more have been injured and looting has been widespread.\n\nThe elders have many questions: when will the next outbreak be? What will the government do? Will their families, homes and businessmen ever be safe?\n\nAmir Sheikh, a community leader who came from Somalia 16 years ago, said: \u201cEvery day we are living in fear.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 2:38 'No brotherly love\u2019: what's behind the wave of hatred towards foreigners in South Africa? \u2013 video\n\nAccording to community leaders, the attacks last week had been building for several months. Anti-immigrant rhetoric has been circulating on social media and among groups who allege immigrants cheat their customers with out-of-date produce in their shops, take jobs from locals and defraud the state.\n\nAmong the victims of the recent attacks were dozens of Bangladeshi shopkeepers including Salahuddin Abdulhilim, who fled political violence in Dhaka nine years ago to start a new life in Soweto, one of Johannesburg\u2019s townships, where he owns a small supermarket.\n\n\u201cI came to work, to earn a living. I pay my taxes, employ seven South African workers, all my papers are in order,\u201d he said.\n\nAbdulhilim, 39, joined hundreds of others who fled to Mayfair in recent days. Many have lost their businesses \u2013 burned to the ground, or thoroughly looted. Most had to face terrifying ordeals as they tried to prevent often dozens of men armed with sticks, knives, petrol bombs and sometimes guns from breaking into their shops.\n\n\u201cIt was very frightening \u2026 We ran. They were coming in with crowbars and hammers \u2026 We used to hear of an incident here or there, but now it is all the time. People are dying. It has been getting worse and worse. We are a target and no one wants to protect us,\u201d Abdulhilim said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Police patrol the streets after overnight unrest and looting in the Alexandra township in Johannesburg.

According to local media, two people were killed and more than 30 arrested near Cape Town when mobs attacked and looted foreign-owned shops on Sunday.\n\nMost migrants in South Africa come from neighbouring countries, especially Zimbabwe, where decades of economic and political instability have forced many of the former British colony\u2019s most talented, motivated and educated overseas.\n\nThe exact number of immigrants in South Africa, which has a population of 56 million, is unknown. One senior police official was criticised by experts after he claimed the number was higher than 11 million. A 2011 census had set it at 2.2 million.\n\nThe recent attacks have drawn criticism from across the continent. In Nigeria, where South Africa\u2019s diplomatic representations have been closed, South African-owned shops have also been attacked.\n\nLast week, South Africa\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, made a televised address calling for an end to the attacks, asking citizens to remember the role others on the continent played in the decades-long battle against the repressive, racist apartheid regime.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People rummage through items from looted foreign-owned shops in Alexandra township.

Nevertheless, in recent days stores, shisha shops and tailoring sweatshops in Mayfair had to bring down their shutters on two occasions, fearing attacks.\n\nThe few attempts by groups of thugs to spread the violence into Mayfair were seen off by local men. But the growing anger is directed not just at the attackers but also what is seen as ineffectual policing. \u201cThe police are part and parcel of this. They have been harassing migrants for months, using bad language, beating, taking goods,\u201d said Sheikh.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nigerian foreign nationals remove a looter from their shops in Troyeville, Johannesburg Photograph: AP\n\nIn 2015, seven people were reported killed during outbreaks of xenophobic violence in Johannesburg and Durban. In 2008, more than 60 people died in a more intense outbreak.\n\nExperts cite multiple causes. South Africa has some of the highest levels of violent crime in the world, with soaring unemployment, extreme inequality and patchy policing.\n\nRepresentatives of migrant communities accuse senior officials in the ruling African National Congress and other politicians of using xenophobic language that encourages attacks.\n\nOn Sunday, a statement by the ANC called for an end to the attacks on migrants and but also for tighter border controls, adding that \u201claw-abiding citizens are understandably sick of those who are breaking the moral fibre of our society by turning our kids into prostitutes and drug addicts\u201d.\n\nLoren Landau of the African Centre for Migration and Society at Witwatersrand University said the specific location of xenophobic violence often depended on complex social and political factors on the ground. \u201cThis is not just about people who are poor and disappointed \u2026 a lot is about local-level politics,\u201d he said.", "description": "Migrants in South Africa\u2019s commercial capital face looting, violence and sometimes even death", "authors": ["Jason Burke"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7986e7efd63aff1355fc23911073f22197fbeb42/197_199_4458_2675/master/4458.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ea0b11e833f32d1a10c793832c20db0f", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
