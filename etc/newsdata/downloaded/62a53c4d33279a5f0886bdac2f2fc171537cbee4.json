He's got three but you need more than three to be the manager of your own team.\n\n'We were riding a crest of a wave and were flying. And all we did was subtle changes. We brought back a feel good factor.\n\nBut Solskjaer's side have struggled despite the signings and currently sit 12th in the table\n\n'We got on with everybody made everybody smile, the players reacted really well.\n\n'We wanted to bring something back that was Man United and all we did we told the players they were going to wear suits again for away games.\n\n'It was as if we had brought something back that was part of the culture of the club and wearing the badge.\n\n'It was subtle changes but they worked. We went off like a flyer and we dropped the same way but there were reasons for that.\n\nNevertheless Phelan has backed Solskjaer despite players 'bottoming out' after the initial high\n\n'We took them from nothing to sky high, the fitness levels went through the roof but they bottomed out because it was just too much and they weren't prepared for it.'\n\nFurther financial investment in the playing squad would require the approval of Ed Woodward, who once again publicly backed Solskjaer by describing him as the walking, talking' version of the club's philosophy.\n\nRecent reports have suggested United could sack Solskjaer should they suffer defeat in their clash with Liverpool, but Woodward has once again reiterated his belief that the Norwegian is the man to bring about the club's revival.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan has said Ole Gunnar Solskjaer knows that his squad requires further investment to turn the club's fortunes around on the field.", "authors": ["Kishan Vaghela For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/12/19954918-0-image-a-13_1571572200260.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
