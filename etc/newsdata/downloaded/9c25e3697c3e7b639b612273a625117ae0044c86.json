Our evolutionary paths diverged from those of chimpanzees and gorillas about six million years ago. Though we do share over 90% of our DNA with them, apes are distant cousins, not great-great-great (etc.) grandparents.\n\nA great deal of your body mass is just bacteria\n\n2. You are actually less than half human\n\nAbout 43%, to be precise. This much of your body is made up of human cells, while the rest is a mix of bacteria, viruses and fungi that combine to make your microbiome. This is thought to be as individual to each person as their fingerprint, and plays a role in many vital body functions from digestion to the immune system.\n\n3. Darwin wasn\u2019t right about everything\n\nHe\u2019s best known for popularising the theory of evolution in his book, On the Origin of Species, but Charles Darwin also had some very unsubstantiated ideas about human beings... In a later book, he wrote that qualities like intellect and sense of smell were greater or lesser in different racial groups. He also thought that \u201cthe average of mental power in man must be above that of woman.\u201d Needless to say, none of these claims have borne out.", "description": "How much do we really know about our own species?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p06rmsjt.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
