Giuliani is also reportedly under investigation for whether his work in Ukraine broke laws on foreign lobbying.\n\nA crucial contact for Giuliani was Yuriy Lutsenko, an embattled top prosecutor who faced being fired after the election of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nLutsenko, who has himself been accused of corruption by civil society activists, said he met Giuliani because he was ready to discuss a joint official investigation into Burisma \u2013 the gas company where Hunter Biden worked \u2013 and also to pursue a separate investigation into money stolen by the previous government.\n\nLutsenko was one of five prosecutors contacted by Giuliani, including the former general prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who resigned under pressure in 2016.\n\nIn Ukraine, Lutsenko was widely seen as an intriguer. Yegor Sobolev, a former politician and head of the Ukrainian parliament\u2019s anti-corruption committee, said that he was \u201ca new kind\u201d of prosecutor, \u201cnot afraid to step across the line and get involved in politics\u201d unlike his predecessors.\n\nLutsenko also clashed with the then US ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who told congressional investigators earlier this month she had learned of a \u201cconcerted campaign\u201d to have her fired. Yovanovitch was abruptly removed in May after Giuliani pressed for changes at the embassy.\n\nAccording to the indictment against Fruman and Parnas, the campaign against her was led by a Ukrainian official, but Lutsenko denied he had asked Giuliani to lobby to have Yovanovitch fired.\n\n\u201cGiuliani and especially these two guys [Parnas and Fruman] told me that they are against her as an ambassador long before our meeting,\u201d Lutsenko said in a telephone interview from London where he is attending English classes.\n\n\u201cYes I had not a good relationship with her because she tried openly to control my activity and to interfere in our activity \u2026 but I never asked about any deal.\u201d\n\nLutsenko said last year that Yovanovitch had given him a list of people he should not prosecute, but later retracted the claim. A law enforcement source has told the Guardian that Lutsenko exaggerated claims to Giuliani, including the \u201cdon\u2019t prosecute\u201d list, in order to curry political favour to help him keep his job.\n\nGiuliani has since claimed, without evidence, that the \u201cdon\u2019t prosecute\u201d list was part of a liberal anti-Trump conspiracy bankrolled by the philanthropist George Soros\n\nAlso in Giuliani\u2019s meetings with Lutsenko were Parnas and Fruman, two Florida real estate developers born in the former Soviet Union, who had become key operatives for Giuliani to dig up dirt in Ukraine. They had turned heads with a $325,000 donation to a Trump-aligned political action committee in May 2018, facilitating access to the White House and the US president\u2019s Florida resort Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThey also paid Giuiliani $500,000, the former New York mayor has said, and accompanied him to high-profile events such as the state funeral of George Bush, the former US president, in December.\n\nFruman, 53, had the better connections in Ukraine. Since the 1990s, he had run a luxury goods business in Odessa, the Black Sea port city, that provided everything from Jaguar automobiles to exotic food products to Ukraine\u2019s jet set, and he also owned stakes in hotels and Kyiv clubs including Buddha Bar.\n\nBut business could be unpredictable: SEC records show that Fruman\u2019s company, Fd Import & Export Corp, sued in 2001 for nearly $1m in damages when a shipment of bananas from Ecuador to Ukraine was shown to be diseased and \u201cfraudulently and intentionally\u201d mislabeled as Bonita bananas.\n\nBy 2016 \u2013 even before a difficult divorce settlement with his ex-wife \u2013 Fruman was seen as desperate.\n\n\u201cHe was just a bankrupt guy, a crook I would say, who was looking for some fortune and opportunities,\u201d said David Sakvarelidze, a former Ukrainian regional prosecutor who met Fruman after he was assigned to work in Odessa in 2015. \u201cHe had big financial troubles and I was told he basically already was living in the United States at that time, in Miami. He was looking for some opportunities to settle his financial problems. Maybe he could use his connections to Giuliani\u2019s team to settle his financial troubles, that\u2019s my presumption.\u201d\n\nFruman and Parnas appeared to do just that, attempting to persuade the Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky to set up a meeting with Zelenskiy, the new president, and also pitching a scheme to replace the head of Naftogaz, the Ukrainian state oil and gas company, with an executive who could direct business their way.\n\nRick Perry, the US energy secretary, later made similar efforts, lobbying the Ukrainian government to make changes to Naftogaz\u2019s board of directors, the Associated Press reported.\n\nFruman also had become a major player in Kyiv\u2019s Jewish community, employing Giuliani\u2019s public profile to help fundraise for one of Ukraine\u2019s top rabbis, Moshe Reuven Azman.\n\nAt a celebration for the 120th anniversary of the founding of Kyiv\u2019s Brodsky synagogue, Fruman pledged to raise more than $1m for orphans at a village established by Azman for Jewish refugees from the war in east Ukraine. And in an interview with an Israeli journalist, Fruman claimed to have delivered a handwritten note from Azman to Trump. Azman declined repeated requests for interviews.\n\nAlso present at the synagogue was Rabinovich, the Ukrainian businessman, who donated the memorial in Kyiv to the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York bearing the words \u201cthou shalt not kill\u201d. Through his library foundation, Rabinovich claimed Giuliani had not been paid and said he had not seen Giuliani since the visit.\n\nBut the 2003 visit heralded a decade of consulting and publicity trips to Ukraine for Giuliani, who has traded on his US political connections and his reputation as the mayor who steered New York through the Trade Centre attack to collect a small fortune in lucrative speaking fees and security contracts in the ex-Soviet state.\n\nTrump, the whistleblower and the comic: key players in the Ukraine scandal Read more\n\nIn 2008, he consulted the former heavyweight boxer Vitali Klitschko during his campaign to become the mayor of Kyiv. In 2017, he spoke at a conference organised by Victor Pinchuk, the Ukrainian metals magnate who had previously donated $150,000 to Trump\u2019s charitable foundation, attracting scrutiny from the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller.\n\nHis security firm was also hired by Pavel Fuks, a wealthy businessman from Kharkiv, in 2017 to consult the city on its emergency services and foreign investment. While the value of the contracts have not been made public, a person with knowledge of Giuliani\u2019s business dealings said their total value was well above $1m.\n\nFor many Ukrainians, Giuliani was seen as a bridge into exclusive political and decision-making circles that could review US policy toward Ukraine.\n\n\u201cGiuliani was not searching for us, we were searching for him,\u201d Telizhenko, the former Ukrainian embassy employee, said of how Ukrainians concerned about political pressure in the country sought out Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani \u201cknew the names, who was connected to who. He\u2019s the filter in all this situation ... He might be the top expert on Ukraine in the United States\u201d.", "description": "Former New York mayor finds himself at centre of impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump", "authors": ["Andrew Roth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11884d136e833b35db4aa6576ea77bc8e8865334/0_21_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7134ca64db057a28e7d0955d735d569b", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
