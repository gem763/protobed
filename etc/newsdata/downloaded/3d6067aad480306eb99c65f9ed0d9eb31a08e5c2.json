It didn't comment on the substance of the discussion, saying in an emailed response to a query that \"as usual, we are not reporting on such confidential conversations.\"\n\nEuropean Commission spokesperson Mina Andreeva said \"the EU position has not changed. We want a deal. We are working for a deal with the U.K.\"\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk tweeted testily that \"what's at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.\"\n\n\"At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people,\" he said, addressing Johnson. \"You don't want a deal, you don't want an extension, you don't want to revoke, quo vadis?\" \u2014 a Latin phrase meaning \"where are you going?\"\n\n.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BorisJohnson</a>, what\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game. At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke, quo vadis? \u2014@eucopresident\n\nEU leaders have demanded more \"realism\" from Britain in response to a Brexit plan proposed by Johnson. The bloc says the proposals don't fulfil the U.K.'s commitment to a frictionless border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, has urged the bloc to compromise.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has said the EU will assess by Friday whether a deal is possible.\n\nJohnson insists the U.K. will leave the EU on Oct. 31 even without a deal. Many economists say that would disrupt trade and plunge the country into recession.\n\nOn Tuesday, Britain published more details of its plans for a no-deal Brexit, which the government says can minimize any economic shock from leaving without a deal \u2014 but major business groups warn that no amount of preparation can eliminate the pain of new barriers with the EU, which accounts for almost half of U.K. trade.\n\nWon't see delay: Johnson\n\nMany in the EU \u2014 and in the United Kingdom \u2014 are skeptical Britain would leave the bloc on Oct. 31, because the U.K. Parliament has passed a law compelling the government to ask the EU for a delay to Brexit if no deal is agreed upon by Oct. 19.\n\nJohnson said he would obey the law, but would not ask for a delay. It's not clear how those two statements can be reconciled \u2014 but it's clear Johnson wants to pin the blame for any delay on Parliament and the EU, so that he can campaign as a champion of Brexit in a U.K. election that's likely to be called soon.\n\nKeir Starmer, Brexit spokesperson for the main opposition Labour Party, said the Downing Street statement was \"yet another cynical attempt by No. 10 to sabotage the negotiations.\"\n\n\"Boris Johnson will never take responsibility for his own failure to put forward a credible deal. His strategy from Day 1 has been for a no-deal Brexit,\" he said.\n\nParliament is set to be suspended later Tuesday so a new session can begin next week with a major policy speech from the government.\n\nAn earlier attempt by the government to shut down Parliament for five weeks was ruled illegal by the U.K. Supreme Court because it prevented Parliament from scrutinizing the government's Brexit plans. This week's shorter suspension is more routine. Lawmakers will return on Monday for the state opening of Parliament, which will include a speech delivered by Queen Elizabeth that will outline legislative plans.\n\nBut most of those plans may be halted by an early election. Both government and the opposition see a national vote as the only way to break Britain's Brexit deadlock, though they disagree on the timing.", "description": "The U.K. government says the chances of a Brexit deal with the European Union are fading fast, as the two sides remain unwilling to shift from their entrenched positions", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5312973.1570530186!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/britain-brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
