In early September, after a hearing with acting director of BLM William Pendley, the congressman called a subpoena \u201cthe next step.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hearing validated some things we had been considering and also justifies us going further in the consideration of a subpoena to get those reorganization papers. I think that\u2019s the next step,\u201d Grijalva said at the time.\n\nNear the end of the month, frustration with Interior had extended to both parties.\n\nAt a Sept. 26 hearing with Interior\u2019s newly confirmed solicitor, Grijalva said the committee had sent 24 requests to Interior, with only three responses providing enough information to be deemed satisfactory.\n\n\u201cInterior\u2019s refusal to cooperate means this committee cannot do the oversight envisioned in our Constitution,\u201d Grijalva said at the hearing. \u201cThat has not stopped the Trump administration from delaying, obstructing and sometimes just ignoring our efforts to conduct oversight.\"\n\nRep.

He promised lawmakers he would follow up on a number of requests they made, including a request for planning documents tied to Interior\u2019s decision to move 300 Washington-based BLM employees to various offices across the West.\n\nThe senior staffer said many of those requests, some of which had Oct. 4 deadlines, have not been fulfilled.\n\nThe Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.\n\nA potential Interior subpoena might also include a request for details on a southern Arizona housing development plan the agency signed off on in 2017. An agency whistleblower later said he was forced to greenlight the project.\n\nMeanwhile, the head of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee is also considering taking subpoena action. The committee is in the process of discussing next steps after a two-week congressional recess resulted in few responses from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), according to a senior committee staffer.\n\nRep.

We will continue to work in good faith with the Committee as we have the past few months,\" a spokesperson told The Hill.\n\nThe spokesperson added that the acting head of the EPA's Office of Research and Development, Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, is slated to testify before the committee on the EPA\u2019s science transparency rule in November.\n\nJohnson's committee has been particularly interested in details about changing regulations for formaldehyde.\n\nLawmakers have scrutinized the chemical program following reports that the agency suppressed a 2017 report outlining the health risks associated with formaldehyde.\n\nJohnson has also been pressing the EPA to explain why in December 2018 it removed formaldehyde and nine other chemical assessments from its program outlook.\n\nSeparately, Johnson has demanded information from the Commerce Department on two occasions related to a statement the agency released in September reprimanding its National Weather Service station in Birmingham, Ala., for contradicting President Trump Donald John TrumpBusiness school deans call for lifting country-specific visa caps Bolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report MORE\u2019s erroneous statements that Hurricane Dorian was forecast to hit Alabama.\n\nIn an Oct. 10 letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross Wilbur Louis RossOvernight Energy: Dems subpoena Perry in impeachment inquiry | EPA to overhaul rules on lead contamination tests | Commerce staff wrote statement rebuking weather service for contradicting Trump Commerce staff drafted statement rebuking weather service for contradicting Trump's hurricane predictions US, in reversal, does not support Brazil's entry to OECD MORE, Johnson said the agency failed to respond to seven questions the science committee outlined in a previous letter about the hurricane statement.
