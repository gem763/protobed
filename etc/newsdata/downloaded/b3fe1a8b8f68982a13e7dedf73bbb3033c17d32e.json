Kavanaugh, but rank-and-file members and 2020 presidential contenders can\u2019t resist the impulse to try to score political points.\n\nIt is not the first time that Democrats in Washington have rushed to embrace the most sordid storyline to try to curry favor with prized slices of the electorate. In 2017, Democrats sacrificed one of their own, Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota, when he was accused of sexual mischief.\n\nSen. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Tuesday that the Kavanaugh impeachment push isn\u2019t going anywhere on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he told The Washington Times, adding that lawmakers would be better off focusing on whether Senate Republicans rammed through the confirmation without carrying out a proper investigation.\n\n\u201cDo you think for one second that [Senate Republicans] will allow an impeachment vote on this?\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Leahy was among the Democrats who demanded Mr. Franken\u2019s resignation. In hindsight, though, he said he wished he had let the Senate Select Committee on Ethics complete its investigation into the accusations. Although he said he doesn\u2019t \u201cequate\u201d the Franken and Kavanaugh episodes, others see parts of them through a similar lens.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh survived grueling confirmation hearings last year after a series of decades-old allegations of sexual assaults further polarized Washington and the nation. None of the accusations have been proved true.\n\nLawrence R. Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs, said the sort of sober reflection that came out of the Franken scandal has been missing among the 2020 presidential candidates and left-wing activists.\n\nThose groups, he said, insist that Justice Kavanaugh is a liar and that he should be impeached in the wake of a New York Times story that rehashed unproven allegations against President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court pick.\n\n\u201cThere was a learning, among some Democrats at least, that a rush to judgment on allegations of sexual harassment or abuse can lead to unfair treatment and maybe miscarried justice in terms of the penalty and whether it matches the crime,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said.\n\n\u201cI think the lessons that were learned by Democrats in the way Al Franken was treated are not appearing in the way that Kavanaugh is being treated,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders, Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas have called for Justice Kavanaugh to be impeached.\n\n\u201cBrett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people,\u201d Ms. Harris tweeted Sunday.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, New York Democrat and House Judiciary Committee chairman, threw cold water on the idea by saying lawmakers are focused on their investigation into whether Mr. Trump should be impeached.\n\nPressure continued to build Tuesday after Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, a member of the far-left \u201cSquad,\u201d introduced a resolution calling on Mr. Nadler\u2019s committee to investigate whether Justice Kavanaugh should be impeached.\n\nMs. Harris also sent Mr. Nadler a letter urging him to open an investigation into the accusations laid out in the New York Times report and into \u201chow and why the FBI\u2019s investigation was limited in scope.\u201d\n\nThe opinion piece in The New York Times rehashed allegations that Deborah Ramirez made against Mr. Kavanaugh during the confirmation process \u2014 namely that he thrust his penis in her face at a party when they were both students at Yale University.\n\nRepublican leaders say the Ramirez accusations were thoroughly investigated. They also say they didn\u2019t know about a charge in The New York Times story about the future justice supposedly having his genitals shoved into a woman\u2019s hands.\n\nThe woman in question did not make that charge, and The New York Times later clarified in an \u201ceditor\u2019s note\u201d that she declined to be interviewed and didn\u2019t remember the episode. The Times reporters knew about these facts, which were left out of the original story.\n\nThe political saga raised questions about whether Ms. Harris and others talked too quickly about impeachment.\n\nSen. Richard Burr, North Carolina Republican, said candidates would pay a political price for jumping onto the impeachment bandwagon.\n\n\u201cLet the elections play out, and you will see it live,\u201d he said.\n\nThe events also provided Mr. Trump and his administration with fodder to make the case that Democrats and mainstream media are in cahoots.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats and their allies in the media are obviously getting desperate,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday at The Heritage Foundation. \u201cThis week, they\u2019ve taken to smearing a sitting justice on the Supreme Court of the United States with discredited allegations.\u201d\n\nScott Ferson, a Democratic consultant, said the Democrats calling for Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment are not interested in claiming the moral high ground or wooing middle-of-the-road voters.\n\n\u201cThey are talking to Democratic primary voters. It is 5% of the Democratic Party. They are the hard-core activists, they are horrified by Donald Trump and whatever the latest outrage is,\u201d he said.\n\nAlex Conant, a Republican political strategist, said the entire episode is emblematic of a broader trend.\n\n\u201cI think it is a lot of politics is such a team sport right now, and everyone thinks that their side is telling the truth and the other is a bunch of liars, and so when there are things like The New York Times\u2019 Kavanaugh episode, that just confirms what everyone on the right thinks about the left, but it doesn\u2019t really discredit the left to liberals,\u201d Mr. Conant said.\n\n\u201cLiberals look at it and think The New York Times made an innocent mistake, but Kavanaugh is a bad guy, so I am not going to fault reporters or candidates for being aggressive,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cIt leaves the independent voters hating everybody and disgusted by Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why we keep having change elections because they think whoever is in power is a bunch of liars, and they are not completely wrong.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
