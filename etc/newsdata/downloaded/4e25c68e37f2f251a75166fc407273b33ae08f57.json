Love Your Life.\"\n\nIn it, Richardson says that she found herself constantly thinking of peers as competition, and constantly working as hard as she could to advance \u2014 but that meant her leadership was lacking. So she decided to lead as though she was making her role obsolete.\n\nDavidson, her executive life coach, said that leading to make your role obsolete creates more space for new opportunities. It will also make people genuinely want to follow you.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nIn the first 10 years of my career, I pushed as hard as I could, constantly comparing myself to others, always trying to prove I was worthy. I saw my peers as competition and judged those who were in positions I felt I deserved. My view was that you only have one shot in your lifetime to get to the top, and I intended to make the most of it. And yet, I kept getting overlooked. Things weren't progressing fast enough. The world was moving so quickly while my advancement felt like it was moving at a snail's pace.\n\n\"Work Freely: Love Your Job. Love Your Life.\" Courtesy of Nancy Richardson and Rochelle Davidson\n\nI couldn't understand why this was happening when I was working so hard, putting in a massive number of hours, and delivering on my responsibilities. I didn't realize at the time that, although I was delivering on the functional requirements of my job, my leadership was severely lacking. And because of this, the good work I did was being overshadowed by who I was being and how I showed up. I constantly got in the way of myself \u2014 pulled into the office gossip, dragged down by daily frustrations, and consumed by reorgs, reporting structures, and titles.\n\nMy drive, raw determination, and tenacity were the qualities that got me to this point, but they also would cause me to fail and hit a ceiling if I continued down this path. To access the next level of leadership that would propel me forward, I needed to take a fundamentally different approach.", "description": "Nancy Richardson shares in her book \"Work Freely: Love Your Job.
