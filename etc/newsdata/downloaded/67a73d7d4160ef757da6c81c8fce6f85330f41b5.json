The version Heard posted did not have the black heart seen in the magazine\u2019s post below:\n\nHeard highlighted what she described as \u201crigorous\u201d community guidelines against showing the female nipple by posting an image of her \u201cAquaman\u201d co-star Jason Momoa edited onto her original image:\n\n\u201cIn honor of IG\u2019s rigorous and equitable Community Guidelines against showing the Female nipple ..and since mine enjoyed the brief privilege that\u2019s afforded to my male counterparts.. I decided to pay homage by replacing it with a picture that DID meet IG\u2019s strict nudity guidelines and such careful gender policies,\u201d she wrote in the caption.\n\nAs an afterthought, Heard cheekily apologized to Momoa in the comments for using his image to send her message.\n\n\u201cBtw, love you AquaHubbs!\u201d she wrote. \u201cSorry to use your pecs to make a point!\u201d\n\nInstagram\u2019s community guidelines prohibit nudity, including female nipples. This excludes photos of mastectomy scarring and women who are actively breastfeeding.\n\n\u201cWe know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don\u2019t allow nudity on Instagram,\u201d the guidelines state.\n\nThe company previously blamed Apple for its banning of the nipple, saying that allowing nudity would force them to increase their age restriction to 17 from its current 12+ rating on the App Store, meaning a portion of younger users would no longer be allowed to use the platform. This argument, however, does not address the notion that female nipples are perceived as nudity while male nipples are not.\n\nMany celebrities, including Chrissy Teigen, Chelsea Handler, Miley Cyrus, Cara DeLevingne and Kendall Jenner, have publicly supported the #FreeTheNipple movement, the mission of which is to promote gender equality and women\u2019s rights to choose how they display their bodies.", "description": "The actor apologized to her \"Aquaman\" co-star for using his \"pecs to make a point\" after an image of her own nipple was taken down.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dae4df52100006b21ad3789.jpeg?cache=2adccllmdk&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
