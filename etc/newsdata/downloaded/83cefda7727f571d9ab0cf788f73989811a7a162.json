Already, we know that Giuliani, aside from Trump, was the major booster of the White House\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the business dealings of vice-presidential son Hunter Biden, making plans to travel to Ukraine to squeeze the government in May, and meeting with a Ukrainian official in August, when he \u201cstrongly urged him\u201d to take action.\n\nNow, a report from the Washington Post reveals just how chaotic Giuliani\u2019s actions were within the administration \u2014 and just how much of the current impeachment crisis Trump is facing can be sourced back to his personal lawyer. \u201cRudy \u2014 he did all of this,\u201d one U.S. official told the Post. \u201cThis shitshow that we\u2019re in \u2014 it\u2019s him injecting himself into the process.\u201d After the Mueller investigation wrapped up, administration officials state that Giuliani pushed for staffing changes at the U.S. embassy, lobbying to replace ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, an Obama appointee. \u201cShe is now working for Soros,\u201d Giuliani recently told the paper, despite the fact that she\u2019s still employed by the State department. According to the Post, he \u201calso had his own emissaries in Ukraine who were meeting with officials, setting up meetings for him and sending back information that he could circulate in the United States.\u201d Giuliani also regularly briefed Trump on his goings-on in Kiev.\n\nNaturally, the actual State department and intelligence apparatus was frustrated by Giuliani\u2019s shadow operation. Per the Post:\n\nThen-national security adviser John Bolton was outraged by the outsourcing of a relationship with a country struggling to survive Russian aggression, officials said. But by [July] his standing with Trump was strained, and neither he nor his senior aides could get straight answers about Giuliani\u2019s agenda or authority, officials said. Bolton declined to comment. \u201cWe had the same visibility as anybody else \u2014 watching Giuliani on television,\u201d a former senior official said. Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev were similarly deprived of information, even as they faced questions from Ukrainians about whether Giuliani was a designated representative. \u201cThe embassy didn\u2019t know what to do with the outreach,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who traveled to Ukraine this month.\n\nAdministration officials were also concerned by Giuliani\u2019s influence going into Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky: \u201cMindful of Giuliani\u2019s agitation and influence, some [officials] worried that even if he were coached before the call, Trump would not be able to resist pressing Zelensky for dirt on Biden.\u201d Senior officials even worked to block the meeting, fearing (correctly) that Trump would pressure Zelensky to dig for dirt on the Bidens.\n\nOf course, to consider Trump\u2019s political crisis in Ukraine to be the fault of his personal lawyer ignores two key motivations from the president himself: His willingness to block the whistle-blower report after the fact, and his enthusiasm, time and again, for soliciting foreign interference in U.S. elections.\n\nWhether or not President Trump faces genuine political consequence in the coming impeachment inquiry, one has to wonder what happens to his personal lawyer, considering that Trump demands loyalty, but apportions none out. If a scandal ever needed a fall guy, Giuliani sure looks ready for a nudge from the embattled White House.", "description": "As President Trump prepares for an impeachment inquiry, a report from the Washington Post reveals how Rudy Giuliani\u2019s meddling in Ukraine helped lead to Trump\u2019s whistle-blower crisis.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/08/22/22-rudy-giuliani.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
