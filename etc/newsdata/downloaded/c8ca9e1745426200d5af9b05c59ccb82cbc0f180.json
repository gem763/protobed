First, this article will compare CEO compensation with compensation at similar sized companies. Then we'll look at a snap shot of the business growth. And finally we will reflect on how common stockholders have fared in the last few years, as a secondary measure of performance. This process should give us an idea about how appropriately the CEO is paid.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Sobha\n\nHow Does Jagdish Sharma's Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies?\n\nAccording to our data, Sobha Limited has a market capitalization of \u20b948b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth \u20b971m over the year to March 2019. That's a notable increase of 32% on last year. We think total compensation is more important but we note that the CEO salary is lower, at \u20b911m. We note that more than half of the total compensation is not the salary; and performance requirements may apply to this non-salary portion. We looked at a group of companies with market capitalizations from \u20b928b to \u20b9114b, and the median CEO total compensation was \u20b928m.\n\nAs you can see, Jagdish Sharma is paid more than the median CEO pay at companies of a similar size, in the same market. However, this does not necessarily mean Sobha Limited is paying too much. We can better assess whether the pay is overly generous by looking into the underlying business performance.\n\nThe graphic below shows how CEO compensation at Sobha has changed from year to year.\n\nNSEI:SOBHA CEO Compensation, September 24th 2019 More\n\nIs Sobha Limited Growing?\n\nOver the last three years Sobha Limited has grown its earnings per share (EPS) by an average of 28% per year (using a line of best fit).

So they may not be at all concerned if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for companies around the same size.\n\nIn Summary...\n\n\n\n\n\nWe examined the amount Sobha Limited pays its CEO, and compared it to the amount paid by similar sized companies. We found that it pays well over the median amount paid in the benchmark group.\n\nHowever we must not forget that the EPS growth has been very strong over three years.
