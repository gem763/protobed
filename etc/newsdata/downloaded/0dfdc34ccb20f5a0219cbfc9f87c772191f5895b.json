So nice to see!\u201d Trump said on Twitter shortly after 11:30 p.m. on Monday.\n\nHe attached a news account of Thunberg\u2019s remarks to the gathering in New York earlier in the day that highlighted a deeply pessimistic quote: \u201cPeople are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth.\u201d\n\nShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see! https://t.co/1tQG6QcVKO \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nAppearing on a panel at the U.N. climate summit, Thunberg chastised leaders for praising young activists like herself while failing to deliver on drastic actions needed to avert the worst effects of climate change, and she warned that if the world continued with business as usual, her generation would face an insurmountable catastrophe.\n\n\u201cThis is all wrong,\u201d said Thunberg, who, with tears in her eyes and her face flushed, was visibly emotional as she spoke.\n\nCameras caught Thunberg giving Trump an icy stare as he arrived at the U.N. gathering earlier in the day.\n\nTrump, who in the past has called climate change a \u201choax,\u201d gave scant attention to the issue that dominated the day on Monday.\n\nAfter scheduling one of his administration\u2019s marquee events \u2014 a forum on religious freedom \u2014 during the U.N. climate summit on Monday, he dropped by the climate event for 14 minutes in a surprise visit. He did not speak and left after listening to remarks from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Angela Merkel, the outgoing German chancellor.\n\n[A Fox News guest called Greta Thunberg \u2018mentally ill.\u2019 The network apologized for the \u2018disgraceful\u2019 comment.]\n\nMerkel and French President Emmanuel Macron offered far different reactions on Monday to Thunberg, who began skipping school in her native Sweden a year ago to protest inaction on climate change.\n\nMerkel met with Thunberg and posted a photo of her impromptu summit with the young activist.\n\nMacron appeared to respond to Thunberg less than an hour later when he addressed the gathering in French and called on his fellow leaders to take more ambitious action given the urgency of the climate threat\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the emotion this morning,\u201d Macron said. \u201cWe cannot let our youth spend every Friday demonstrating for the climate and simply answer, \u2018Everything is fine, we are doing everything right.\u2019 We are still far from the account.\u201d\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.), a former Democratic presidential candidate, reacted to Trump\u2019s tweet about Thunberg with one of his own early Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cBy rallying the world to save itself, she\u2019d already make a better @POTUS than you,\u201d he wrote, adding: \u201c(Also, she\u2019s not a liar, a crook, or a whiny toddler.)\u201d\n\nJuliet Eilperin and Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.", "description": "\u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter hours after the teenager delivered deeply pessimistic remarks at a United Nations gathering.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/D4SUQdkBcAVDFQy_aMGtS5_1DqY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OE23JRG6YAI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
