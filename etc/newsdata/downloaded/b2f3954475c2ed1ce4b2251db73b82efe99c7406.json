John Cornyn John CornynSenators concerned impeachment will consume agenda House passes bill aimed at reducing rape kit backlog Cornyn seeks to clarify remarks about 'ethnic cleansing' of Kurds, US troop removal MORE (R-Texas) introduced a Republican-backed \u201cbill to help prevent mass shootings\" on Wednesday.\n\nThe Restoring, Enhancing, Strengthening, and Promoting Our Nation\u2019s Safety Efforts (Response) Act, which has several Republican co-sponsors, bundles some of the top GOP proposals to combat mass shootings into one bill. It would expand resources for mental health treatment, facilitate the creation of \u201cbehavioral intervention teams\u201d to monitor students exhibiting disturbing behavior and offer new tools for law enforcement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe bill\u2019s school safety proposals are a response to years of school shootings perpetrated by young people described as isolated and troubled.\n\nBut advocates have raised red flags over the Response Act\u2019s requirement that schools begin monitoring their computer networks to \u201cdetect [the] online activities of minors who are at risk of committing self-harm or extreme violence against others.\u201d\n\nUnder Cornyn\u2019s legislation, nearly all federally funded schools in the U.S. would be required to install software to surveil students\u2019 online activities, potentially including their emails and searches, in order to flag \u201cviolent\u201d or alarming content.\n\nThe proposal would significantly expand the Children\u2019s Internet Protection Act (CIPA), a 2000 law that is mostly interpreted today as blocking children from looking up pornography on school computers.\n\nPrivacy experts and education groups, many of which have resisted similar efforts at the state level, say that level of social media and network surveillance can discourage children from speaking their minds online and could disproportionately result in punishment against children of color, who already face higher rates of punishment in school.\n\n\u201cThis is all very frightening,\u201d an education policy consultant, who has been tracking the legislation, told The Hill. \u201cThere\u2019s no real research, or even anecdotal information, to back up the idea \u2026 that following everything [kids] do online is really a way to determine that they\u2019re going to be violent.\u201d\n\nSources told The Hill they have been pressing Cornyn\u2019s office over the issue, pointing out there is little evidence that increasing online monitoring can effectively reduce violence in schools.\n\nThe conflict highlights the high-stakes tradeoffs between children\u2019s privacy and school safety in a country facing a seemingly constant stream of school shootings. \u201cI think these people are well-meaning,\u201d said one source who has been lobbying against the legislation. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any intent to do harm to kids.\u201d\n\nA previous draft of the bill, circulated in September and obtained by The Hill, would have asked schools to monitor children\u2019s online activity \u201cto protect against physical harm,\u201d language that advocates panned as overly broad.\n\nThe version of the legislation introduced this week specifies that schools would be asked to operate a \u201ctechnology protection measure\u201d aimed at identifying children likely to self-harm or commit \u201cextreme\u201d violence, a more specific mandate that whittles down the number of offenses.\n\nStill, Cornyn\u2019s office has been rebuked as they sought endorsements for the bill from several education groups and advocates, according to multiple sources.\n\n\u201cWe applaud Senator Cornyn for taking action on this critically important issue and introducing the RESPONSE Act,\u201d Leslie Boggs, the president of the National Parent-Teacher Alliance, said in a statement to The Hill.\n\n\u201cWhile we have concerns with the bill as it is currently written, we look forward to working with him and his staff to ensure evidence-based best practices for protecting students are used, the school to prison pipeline is not increased, students are not discouraged from seeking mental health and counseling support and that students online activities are not over-monitored,\u201d she said.\n\nSocial media monitoring has spiked dramatically over the past five years as the country works to get ahead of school violence. According to an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice, 63 school districts across the country purchased social media monitoring software last year, a significant increase from six districts in 2013.\n\nThe efforts have been a windfall for the top software companies in the monitoring market, which have made millions of dollars as state and local governments ask schools to draw up more defenses against potential school shootings.\n\nCritics of Cornyn\u2019s bill say those monitoring programs don\u2019t appear to have made a difference, instead resulting in more work for school administrators and less privacy for students.\n\n\u201cSchools that have chosen to purchase automated monitoring software are inundated with alerts flagging concerning behavior,\u201d one privacy expert concerned about the bill said, \u201c[and] some have even seen more than one hundred alerts per day.\u201d\n\nAs it stands, the Response Act has received endorsements from the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Treatment Advocacy Organization, and a range of law enforcement organizations. And the office is continuing outreach to education and children\u2019s privacy groups to solicit their feedback about potential amendments.\n\n\u201cI spent time with families and victims in El Paso and Midland-Odessa following those tragedies and pledged to work with my Senate colleagues on real solutions,\u201d Cornyn said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cI urge my colleagues to come together once again to pass the Response Act to help prevent mass shootings and put a stop to this senseless loss of life.\u201d\n\nSen.

In August alone, there were three mass shootings resulting in dozens of deaths and even more injuries.\n\nTalks between a group of senators and the White House about potential mass shooting legislation have largely stalled amid the launch of an impeachment inquiry this month. But Cornyn\u2019s bill has opened up the conversation again.\n\nThe co-sponsors include Sens.
