I know some people have been canceled for genuinely, like, personal behavior, but Dave [Chappelle] is not getting canceled anytime soon.\u201d\n\nThe writer then turned his attention to television critics who panned Mr. Chappelle\u2019s Netflix special \u201cSticks & Stones\u201d for its lack of political correctness.\n\n\u201cI feel bad for television critics and cultural critics,\u201d Mr. Stone said Sept. 12. \u201cThey may have laughed like hell at that, and then they went home and they know what they have to write to keep their job. So when I read TV reviews or cultural reviews, I think of someone in prison, writing. I think about somebody writing a hostage note. This is not what they think. This is what they have to do to keep their job in a social media world. So I don\u2019t hold it against them.\u201d\n\nMr. Stone also commented on \u201cSouth Park,\u201d which was renewed through 2022 by Comedy Central and will begin its 23rd season on Sept. 25.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any rules,\u201d he said of the pair\u2019s approach to comedy.\n\nMr. Parker said that while he isn\u2019t opposed to making jokes inspired by Mr. Trump, Season 22 offered them a chance to creatively zig while everyone else zagged.\n\n\u201cIt was nice for us,\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cIt was nice to not come in and talk about Donald Trump. And I think it was nice for people to watch and go, \u2018Oh, yeah, there is still comedy outside of f\u2013\u2014g Donald Trump. There is still funny s\u2013 as the world goes on.\u2019 And you can get your Trump comedy on so many other shows.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
