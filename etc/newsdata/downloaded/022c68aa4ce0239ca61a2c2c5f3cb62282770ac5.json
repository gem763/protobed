Falling Man is different.\n\nThe photo, taken by Richard Drew in the moments after the September 11, 2001, attacks, is one man\u2019s distinct escape from the collapsing buildings, a symbol of individuality against the backdrop of faceless skyscrapers. On a day of mass tragedy, Falling Man is one of the only widely seen pictures that shows someone dying.\n\nThe photo was published in newspapers around the U.S. in the days after the attacks, but backlash from readers forced it into temporary obscurity. It can be a difficult image to process, the man perfectly bisecting the iconic towers as he darts toward the earth like an arrow.\n\nFalling Man\u2019s identity is still unknown, but he is believed to have been an employee at the Windows on the World restaurant, which sat atop the north tower. The true power of Falling Man, however, is less about who its subject was and more about what he became: a makeshift Unknown Soldier in an often unknown and uncertain war, suspended forever in history.\n\nRevisiting 9/11: Unpublished Photos by James Nachtwey James Nachtwey for TIME James Nachtwey for TIME James Nachtwey for TIME James Nachtwey for TIME James Nachtwey for TIME James Nachtwey for TIME James Nachtwey for TIME James Nachtwey for TIME James Nachtwey for TIME James Nachtwey for TIME James Nachtwey for TIME James Nachtwey for TIME James Nachtwey for TIME James Nachtwey for TIME James Nachtwey for TIME James Nachtwey for TIME 1 of 16 Advertisement\n\nFollow TIME LightBox on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Most images from 9/11 are of towers, not people.
