The haka requires a response. It\u2019s a challenge to you, personally, and it requires a response. I thought it was brilliant and quite imaginative, too.\u201d\n\nMarler continued to remonstrate with Owens as he left the pitch to take his place on the bench.\n\nColes, though, insisted there were no hard feelings.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s about, I thought it was awesome,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the boys were pretty pumped. They (England\u2019s players) earn a shitload of money so they can afford the fines.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d be like \u2018I\u2019ll take the hit!\u2019 We were looking around at each other, going: \u2018Bring it on\u2019. It was awesome. We enjoyed it.\u201d\n\nAfter the haka, England dominated the early skirmishes, with Tuilagi crashing over for the opening try after just 96 seconds \u2014 setting the All Blacks on their way to their first World Cup defeat in 12 years.\n\nAsked about England\u2019s haka challenge, Springboks head coach Rassie Erasmus said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it was disrespectful\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t make a big issue about it.\u201d\n\nWorld Rugby\u2019s decision to fine England opens the governing body to accusations of hypocrisy, however, after trumpeting England\u2019s actions with a video post that was widely viewed online.\n\nThe clip on World Rugby\u2019s YouTube channel, entitled \u201cEngland\u2019s incredible response to intense New Zealand haka\u201d, has racked up more than four million views.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 England have been fined for crossing the halfway line during New Zealand\u2019s haka after they formed a provocative V-shaped", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/0d2968_england-players-crossed-halfway-line-as-new-zealand-performed-haka-england-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
