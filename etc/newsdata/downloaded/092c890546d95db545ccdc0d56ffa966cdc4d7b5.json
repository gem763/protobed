(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\n\u201cDeals are my art form,\u201d President Trump proclaimed in his ghostwritten book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d \u201cOther people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals.\u201d It\u2019s true that Trump likes making deals. He\u2019s just not very good at it. In fact, he may be the worst dealmaker ever to occupy the Oval Office. The abrupt disintegration of his accord with the Taliban provides the latest evidence that he\u2019s too impetuous and ignorant to be a successful negotiator.\n\nTrump\u2019s special envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, was close to concluding a deal with the Taliban that would have allowed Trump to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan and to proclaim that he had ended an 18-year-old war. Then on Saturday evening, Trump himself blew up immediate prospects of an agreement with a series of tweets announcing that he was withdrawing an invitation for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Taliban leaders to meet with him at Camp David because a Taliban car bombing in Kabul on Thursday had killed a U.S. soldier, Sgt. 1st Class Elis Angel Barreto Ortiz, along with 11 other people.\n\nDisinviting terrorists from Camp David seems like a good idea. It\u2019s appalling that Trump would have even considered hosting Taliban leaders just days before the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks plotted by their ally, Osama bin Laden. Imagine what Trump \u2014 who excoriated President Barack Obama for negotiating with the Taliban \u2014 would have said if Obama had invited them for a sleepover. But Trump\u2019s explanation for the cancellation \u2014 as with most things he says \u2014 makes little sense.\n\nThe Taliban have been staging attacks throughout their negotiations with the United States \u2014 and Afghan and U.S. security forces have been carrying out operations against it. The United Nations reports that 1,366 civilians were killed and 2,446 wounded during the first half of the year. Maybe Trump cares only about U.S. casualties? Well, 16 additional U.S. troops have been killed by hostile action in Afghanistan so far this year. Sgt. Ortiz\u2019s death was tragic but hardly a departure from the violent norm, because the Taliban never agreed to a cease-fire.\n\nIt is bizarre to call off negotiations because the other side continues doing something it never agreed to stop doing. That is why savvy observers speculate that there must be another reason for Trump\u2019s abrupt tweets.\n\nIt\u2019s far from clear that the Taliban would have been willing to meet with Ghani or become props in Trump\u2019s reality show; so far, they haven\u2019t met with any representatives of a Kabul government they consider to be illegitimate. But the real problem may have simply been that Trump got cold feet about an agreement that has been criticized by his conservative allies, former U.S. generals and ambassadors in Afghanistan, and even by his own national security adviser, John Bolton, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nIndeed, there was much grounds for criticism. It is telling that Khalilzad reportedly refused to give either Bolton or Ghani a copy of the agreement. That\u2019s hardly a vote of confidence in its contents.\n\nFrom what we have learned so far, the agreement called for the United States to pull 5,400 troops from Afghanistan within 135 days and the other 8,600 within roughly 16 months \u2014 conveniently close to the 2020 U.S. election. In return, the Taliban would have simply had to make a nebulous pledge to disown al-Qaeda and not allow their territory to be used for attacks on the United States. Khalilzad hoped that the Taliban and the Afghan government would reach a peace deal after the conclusion of the U.S. withdrawal agreement. But if they didn\u2019t, the odds are that this deal would have resulted not in peace but in a civil war that would eventually leave the Taliban in control of much of the country \u2014 as it was before 9/11.\n\nThis could, in fact, still happen. Trump\u2019s decision to scrap the Camp David meeting doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s scrapping the negotiations. Recall that on May 24, 2018, he called off his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \u2014 before agreeing to see him after all less than three weeks later. These kinds of walkouts are a standard part of Trump\u2019s negotiating repertoire. He thinks these histrionics give him \u201cleverage.\u201d His history of failed negotiations suggests otherwise.\n\nInstead of producing a deal with China, he has sparked an endless trade war. Instead of denuclearizing North Korea, he has allowed Pyongyang to test ballistic missiles and expand its nuclear arsenal while refusing to send envoys to negotiate. Instead of stopping Iran\u2019s nuclear program, he has actually accelerated it. Instead of reaching the \u201cdeal of the century\u201d between Palestinians and Israelis, his peace plan has still failed to materialize. Now Trump\u2019s special envoy for Middle East peace has resigned, to be replaced by Jared Kushner\u2019s 30-year-old gofer. And negotiations to get Mexico to pay for the border wall? Fuhgetaboutit. That\u2019s being funded by the Pentagon, which is diverting funds needed to pay for child care for military families and to rehabilitate \u201chigh risk\u201d facilities that pose a threat to workers.\n\nThe Afghanistan mess confirms what has been obvious from the start: As the New Yorker\u2019s Susan B. Glasser and others have noted, Trump is a better dealbreaker than dealmaker.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Trump risks turning a chance for success in Afghanistan into a shameful failure\n\nLindsey Graham and Jack Keane: We can\u2019t outsource our security to anyone \u2014 especially the Taliban\n\nLiz Cheney: How to lose a war, but not end it\n\nDavid Ignatius: Lindsey Graham wants to create a backstop for Afghanistan\n\nFareed Zakaria: The U.S. needs to end the war with Afghanistan without losing the peace", "description": "Once again, the president relies on a strategy that has resulted in horrible outcomes for the United States.", "authors": ["Max Boot", "Columnist Covering National Security", "September At Pm", "A Post Columnist", "Is The Jeane J.
