He tried to credit dignity and worth to children who, through no fault of their own, entered the country illegally. If he\u2019d just said that, Biden would probably have gotten a standing ovation from his audience.\n\nWhat Biden actually did was to insult lots of people who were born here by claiming they care less about America and their communities than the people who entered them illegally. Note well the near-silence with which this was greeted by these South Carolina primary voters (via Twitchy):\n\nJoe Biden on illegal aliens: \u201cAnd these kids who come, and they end up doing well, they become Americans before a lot of Americans become Americans \u2026 I\u2019m serious\u201dpic.twitter.com/FX5LhKtt8i \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) August 30, 2019\n\nThe \u201cI\u2019m serious\u201d is a Bidenism that often accompanies his most offensive statements. It\u2019s as if Biden knows he\u2019s overreached and is trying to bluster his way out of a serious mistake. At least, though, Biden didn\u2019t go full progressive by declaring his support for open borders \u2014 oh, wait:\n\nJoe Biden in SC, asked about detention centers for illegal immigrants: \"Close them down\u2026we don't need them!\" In the middle of an immigration crisis, Joe Biden comes out for more open borders. pic.twitter.com/qEmWLeOvwz \u2014 Andrew Clark (@AndrewHClark) August 29, 2019\n\n\u201cWe found,\u201d Biden tells the audience, \u201cthat if you tell people to show up on such-and-such date, people show up!\u201d That\u2019s absolutely untrue; once released, those arrested for crossing the border illegally (as opposed to those seeking asylum through proper channels) usually skip their court date. If caught and deported, they come back across again. The Obama administration operated the same type of detention centers for that reason, right up to the whole \u201ckids in cages\u201d facilities. Closing the detention centers would signal a complete surrender on border enforcement, allowing anyone crossing at any point for any reason to stay in the US indefinitely.\n\nSo much for being the moderate in the Democratic primary, both in policy and in tone. His repeated inclination to stick his foot in his mouth has already become an issue on the campaign trail, which should make Democrats nervous about whether he\u2019ll implode in the general election. About the only argument Biden has left for the nomination is electability. Expect him to emphasize his unique standing in battleground voters to you gotta be kidding me right now:\n\nBIDEN: And so it\u2019s not like \u2026 I find myself, I think most of the vast majority of the community, young and old, knows where my heart is. And so, I also think \u2026 I mean, for example, if they knew there was someone else \u2026 let\u2019s say, someone who did not have an overwhelming commitment to the African American community and wasn\u2019t familiar with the opportunities and dilemmas. I doubt whether they\u2019d say, \u201cWell I\u2019d beat that person, even though they don\u2019t understand my community, just because he can beat Trump.\u201d They\u2019d be looking for someone who maybe done them as good a chance of beating Trump, but understands the problems and the opportunities that they face. And so, I have not \u2026 your aunt could be right. I don\u2019t think she is, when the assertion is made that \u2026 well, the reason the only person that can beat Trump is, \u201can old white guy.\u201d I just think that \u2026 I think there\u2019s other people in the race who can beat Trump. [Washington Post reporter Jonathan] CAPEHART: Who? BIDEN: Well, I think almost anybody.\n\nCapehart\u2019s also worried about what will happen when Biden starts showing up in those African-American communities:\n\nCAPEHART: And [Jamil Smith] writes, \u201cthat led me to wonder why we haven\u2019t seen much of him thus far in this campaign talking to the black communities that he told the Times he has, \u2018never, ever, ever in my entire life had a circumstance where I felt uncomfortable,\u2019 introducing himself and his policies to our voters. I cannot help but wonder whether he and his campaign consider it too risky to put Biden in front of black folks who may have a particular image of him as a sidekick to their beloved Obama and then he opens his mouth and they\u2019re all confronted with the reality.\u201d What is your response to that? BIDEN: He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. I speak to black communities all the time. Come on. I haven\u2019t come \u2026 I invite him to come with me. I invite him to come with me. I go to black churches, I speak in black churches. I show up in black churches. I come to communities that are overwhelmingly black whether it is in Iowa and there\u2019s some black communities there. You watched today how many of those ministers lined up to support me in the town hall today. Look, I mean, the idea that I\u2019m uncomfortable in black communities, tell him to go back to Delaware. Interview anybody you wanna ask in the black community. I\u2019m not saying everybody\u2019s with me. Ask them whether or not I\u2019m there. I\u2019ve always been there. So, this idea that, you know, I [chuckle] open my mouth. What is it that he thinks that I\u2019m wrong about with regard to the problems relating and the limits relating the black community? I mean, open my mouth and then they\u2019re gonna change their view? Well, maybe he should come with me.\n\nBiden\u2019s never had a problem feeling uncomfortable in public. Biden\u2019s problem is that he often feels too comfortable and lets his mouth run off \u2014 just as he did with the crowd in South Carolina. Barack Obama was smart enough to keep Biden busy outside of campaign season. Biden\u2019s campaign ought to consider a similar strategy.\n\nUpdate: Added \u201cdo\u201d to the headline for clarity.", "description": "Also: don't worry about electability.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/biden-dreamers.png"}
