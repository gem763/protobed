Why TV needs way more female orgasms", "language": "en", "text": "Women masturbating on screen was once the stuff of taboo, but a new wave of refreshingly radical shows are closing TV\u2019s pleasure gap at last\n\nBeing introduced to Netflix\u2019s Big Mouth has been such a thrill. My girlfriend\u2019s 16-year-old daughter sold it to me, promising a talking vulva voiced by Kristen Wiig, a sassy hormone \u2018monstress\u2019 (Maya Rudolph) and a whole world of inclusive, body-positive bits about the messy reality of growing up. It is clever, pleasingly surreal and an absolute hoot. I was sold from the first watch.\n\nThe new series focuses on the obstacle-strewn path young women tread when exploring their sexuality in adolescence. To me, it is the best yet. Watching episode six, How to Have an Orgasm, feels quietly revolutionary. In it, Jessi \u2013 a droll, whip-smart girl you wish had befriended you at school \u2013 learns how to come for the first time. Watching it feels new, exciting and radical because the business of female pleasure is rarely dealt with so centrally and without shame.\n\nIt begins with Jessi\u2019s vulva \u2013 a separate, talking entity \u2013 holding a microphone and hosting a game called \u201cDo the Thing!\u201d Connie (Rudolph\u2019s hormone monstress) cheers her along with a rallying cry of \u201clet\u2019s touch our genitals\u201d as she experiments under the covers with her hand. Pleasure is elusive. Her vulva offers continuous feedback: \u201cThat\u2019s a little pokey, you\u2019re not trying to squash a bug.\u201d\n\nTurning to porn for inspiration, Jessi comes across a video called Bethany\u2019s First Orgasm, in which Bethany uses a vibrator. Jessi goes to a shop with her friend Missy (Jenny Slate) to see what\u2019s available. A talking Harry Potter vibrator falls off the shelf and buzzes across the floor. She doesn\u2019t buy anything but the conversation between the two friends, in which Missy plainly states that \u201ca glow worm and a bath faucet really gets the job done\u201d, is striking, considering how much shame still exists around how women experience pleasure.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The first woman to have an orgasm on the BBC? ...

I remember my heart sinking when Sally Draper was carted off to a psychotherapist for masturbating in Mad Men, but such was the pervasive attitude of the era. Women were pleasure-givers, not receivers; or, if pleasure was received, it was incidental. Luckily, contemporary TV writers are now centralising female pleasure in both celebratory and matter-of-fact ways.\n\nLast year, Toni Collette claimed to be the first woman to have an orgasm on the BBC with Wanderlust; a show that ruffled feathers with its scene involving her masturbating, screwed-up face and all, in front of her partner. We had Phoebe Waller-Bridge wanking over a Barack Obama speech on her laptop while her boyfriend sleeps in Fleabag. In Broad City, Ilana Glazer makes a meal out of masturbation with extensive \u2018self-seduction\u2019 rituals that include lighting candles, putting on lipstick and eating oysters. Bumping back to reality, Insecure saw Issa (Issa Rae) scramble round the house looking for batteries for her vibrator while, ironically, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the word \u2018hump\u2019.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The scramble for vibrator batteries ...

I remember being taken aback watching the first series of Top of the Lake, in which Robyn\u2019s boyfriend pulls her into a pub toilet to go down on her, because it is usually the other way around. It is telling that all these shows have female writers or directors.\n\nAll these instances carry a little revolutionary spark because it has always seemed that when women come on-screen (if indeed they do) it is a quick, smooth and penis-centric affair involving penetration. This does not reflect most women\u2019s realities. (At least two-thirds of women having heterosexual sex cannot come this way; fingers, tongues and vibrators are much more effective.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Quite thrilling ... Gentleman Jack.

Jess Phillips was absolutely right when she said it was vital to discuss female pleasure in compulsory sex education to break down the culture of power imbalance between men and women. Heterosexual women orgasm less with a partner than any other demographic.\n\nThe reasons for this orgasm gap are multifaceted. It is not down to biology, rather any combination of lack of anatomical knowledge, the indifference of a partner, not feeling safe enough to \u2018let go\u2019 or confident enough to self-advocate. Much of our confidence in sex will come from experimenting privately and, hopefully, being with a partner who wants to learn the language. We need to encourage this through awareness from a young age. As Phillips has said, we\u2019re not teaching kids to masturbate \u2013 we\u2019re talking to them about what they\u2019re already doing.\n\nAs of next year, the Department of Education is reforming sex education lessons for the first time in 17 years. Thank the lord. So much of the shame we carry as adults stems from what we experience when we\u2019re pubescent. My mind would have exploded if I\u2019d seen something as bold and right-on as Big Mouth at 14. If I were making the rules, I\u2019d make watching this episode a compulsory part of the curriculum.", "description": "Women masturbating on screen was once the stuff of taboo, but a new wave of refreshingly radical shows are closing TV\u2019s pleasure gap at last", "authors": ["Eleanor Morgan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44618d821f6cf1dd1525b3c2f1e41b26e521fc34/110_0_1720_1032/master/1720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=02981705c624bca0c3d9f2a401cda32f", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
