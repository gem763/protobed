I was asked to work with the authorities as an informant but I refused. Their attitude totally changed then. They became very aggressive. Over the next four days, I slept at home but would go back to the Muharraq police station each day where officers beat me and threatened me with rape.\n\n\u201cThey also threatened to kill me and told me they would kill my children. They said they would fabricate an accident which happened to the children but kill them \u2013 saying \u2018everything will look normal. We can do this to you\u2019.\n\n\u201cWhile being interrogated in police custody, I was also raped. My dignity was destroyed. At one point I was thinking of killing myself and throwing myself from a window so I could end the suffering. But I thought even though they are already keeping me in hell, I do not want to kill myself. I was shocked the person who was the head of police station where I was sexually assaulted and tortured was the beneficiary of a British taxpayers scheme.\u201d\n\nMs Yusuf voiced outrage the British government had sent a delegation of Durham Police to the station where she alleges she was sexually assaulted \u2013 saying this feels like a \u201cbetrayal\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

A spate of incidents of abuse are alleged to have taken place at the station under his watch.\n\nMs Yusuf said she was on her period during her first day in Isa Town detention centre and asked for sanitary products and soap to have a shower but was refused. Ms Yusuf said the conditions there felt like an \u201cextension of the torture from the police station\u201d and prison guards would scream and swear at her.\n\nHer cellmate who is also a political prisoner, Hajer Mansoor, had to go to hospital after being assaulted by prison guards last September and was left with bruises all over her body, Ms Yusuf said.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe felt very vulnerable that we could be attacked at any time by the prison after that and there would be no consequences for their actions. I was only allowed to see my family once from September 2018 until I was released in the summer.\u201d\n\nMs Yusuf\u2019s 85-year-old father-in-law Mansoor Salman died from suffocation in 2012 after heavy amounts of tear gas was fired into their local area.\n\nBahrain, which has been ruled by the Al Khalifa family for more than two centuries, is \u201cone of the Middle East\u2019s most repressive states\u201d according to US NGO Freedom House.\n\nThe UK has licenced \u00a3105m worth of arms to Bahrain since the pro-democracy Arab Spring uprising started in February 2011, according to the Campaign Against Arms Trade.\n\nBahrain is one of the UK\u2019s longest-standing allies in the gulf and Britain has a lengthy history of colonial intervention \u2013 as well as still having naval facilities there.\n\nThe Bahrain Grand Prix was cancelled back in 2011 due to widespread protests over human rights abuse in the country but has gone ahead every year since then.\n\nSayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (Bird), said: \u201cAs if spending over two years arbitrarily imprisoned was not enough, upon Najah\u2019s release she has faced the further insult of being dismissed from her job. To this day, she has received no redress and there is no indication that Bahrain intends to hold her abusers to account. The UN ruling has confirmed manifold violations against Najah Yusuf, from the breach of her right to freely criticise, to her unlawful torture, sexual assault and unfair trial.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Formula One said: \u201cWe have always been clear with all race promoters and governments with which we deal worldwide, including Bahrain, that we take violence, abuse of human rights and repression very seriously. At all times throughout this case we have engaged with relevant parties and made proactive enquiries into Ms Yusuf\u2019s situation. We have done this within the constraints of being a private business, without the powers of investigation (in terms of authority, resource and official channels) to fully uncover all the facts.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Bahraini embassy in London said Ms Yusuf\u2019s claims of mistreatment were fully investigated by the Kingdom of Bahrain\u2019s independent Ombudsman and they found no evidence to support their claims. They said she was convicted of terror offences.\n\n\u201cThe conviction of Najah Yusuf has no connection whatsoever to the Formula One race, nor to any other freedom of expression issues,\u201d the spokesperson added.", "description": "A Bahraini activist who was jailed after\u00a0criticising Formula One\u2019s Grand Prix in the country has said she contemplated suicide after suffering rape and abuse at the hands of the state\u2019s authorities.", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/25/11/najah3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
