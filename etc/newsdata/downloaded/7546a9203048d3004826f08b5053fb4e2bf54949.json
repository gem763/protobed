At its lowest on Tuesday the pound fell to 1.1959.\n\nSterling bounced back on Wednesday evening after parliament passed a bill to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal. Hopes of a Brexit extension sent the pound to monthly highs on Thursday.\n\nThe bill passed by parliament compels the Prime Minister to request a Brexit extension if no deal is in place by exit day on Oct. 31. Johnson would be required to seek the extension during the Oct. 17 European Summit. The bill is currently being debated in the House of Lords.\n\nIt is expected that the bill will be passed in the Lords on Friday afternoon. Once passed it will be given royal assent on Monday, making it law.\n\nPM Boris Johnson failed to secure enough backing for a general election on Wednesday evening.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested that there would be another call for an election on Monday.", "description": "Forex - Pound Drops as High Court Rejects Legal Challenge to Prorogation", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC4I15R_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
