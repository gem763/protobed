Indiabulls has denied the allegations.\n\nIndiabulls\u2019 merger with Lakshmi Vilas Bank Ltd is also on thin ice, analysts said, after the country\u2019s central bank last week placed the private sector lender under \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d due to reasons including high level of bad loans.\n\nIndiabulls Managing Director Gagan Banga on Monday tried to assuage investors, saying the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s action on Lakshmi Vilas Bank \u201cdoes not shut the door on the merger\u201d.\n\nIndian police last week also started probing Lakshmi Vilas Bank\u2019s directors for alleged misappropriation of funds.\n\nShares in Indiabulls, which traded at 1,440 rupees at their peak in January last year, fell 11.8% on Tuesday, before recovering to end 4.6% higher at 267.60 rupees.\n\nYes Bank Ltd, whose exposure to the Indiabulls group equals about 22.3% of its net worth, according to Macquarie Research, plunged 22.7% to its lowest close in over a decade.\n\nYes Capital trimmed its stake in Yes Bank by 2.16%, the company said on Tuesday, becoming the latest entity related to founder Rana Kapoor that has cut their stake in the lender.\n\nIndusInd Bank Ltd, which Macquarie says has an exposure to Indiabulls of 9.6% its net worth, dropped 6.2%.\n\nThe Nifty Bank index fell 1.3% to its worst close in nearly two weeks. The declines also weighed on public sector banks, with top lender State Bank of India closing 5.5% lower and the Nifty PSU index dropping 3.8%.", "description": "Shares in major Indian banks took a beating on Tuesday, as fraud allegations against a top mortgage lender and a prominent bank sparked fresh worries about the health of India's financial sector.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
