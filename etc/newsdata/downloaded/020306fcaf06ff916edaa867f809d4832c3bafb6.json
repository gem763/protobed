But with a growing trend for canteen-style eating \u2013 both in our kitchens and dining spaces \u2013 we\u2019re gradually moving away from formal dining chairs and sliding up into casual long-seaters at either side of the table.\n\nWe love the informality of a dining bench. By its very nature it\u2019s a barrier-breaker, forcing us to be a bit more sociable than usual, especially when we\u2019re happily wedged in for a large family get-together.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to team your table with a bench or two, you\u2019d be wise to think carefully about space.\n\nDo you want to maximize on floor space with a seat that you can easily tuck under, or do you have enough room to have both benches fully on show and ready to jump into?\n\nConsider mixing and matching and plump for a single bench on one side (preferably loaded up with scatter cushions) and dining chairs on the other \u2013 it\u2019s a look that\u2019s full of mismatched country kitchen charm.\n\nAn unfussy wooden bench can bring an edgy, industrial feel to our homes. Think locker room, or school hall style pieces that put functionality at the fore.\n\nThese look great in a hallway, and can offer a practical solution when we\u2019re scrambling to get our shoes and coats on each morning.\n\nEqually, a bench can offer a relaxing place to perch in a bedroom or dressing room: choose a long-seater with a plush upholstered cushion and suddenly this functional piece becomes a luxury. There\u2019s a wealth of products that cross over between benches, ottomans and daybeds that are more akin to comfort than a hard wooden bench.\n\nWe put our best benches to the test, looking for both the practical and the pretty \u2013 excellent craftsmanship (a simple bench is unforgiving in its exposure of any shoddy woodwork), as well as affordability.

What we loved most about Noa & Nani\u2019s offering though, was the crisp contrast between the white and dark wood. The bench is made from solid pine, and where you can clearly see the patina of the wood on the top, its pure white painted base offers Scandinavian charm. Rustic, Scandi, Modern... this stylish piece ticks a lot of boxes.\n\nBuy now\n\nGarden Trading woven bench, ash: \u00a3220, Garden Trading\n\nDimensions: W 102cm x H 44cm x D41cm\n\nA Scandi style piece that isn\u2019t all about the pale natural wood, we loved this one for its contemporary black woven webbing, which has just enough give in it to cushion the sitter with comfort, while staying reliably strong. This is a lovely, lightweight bench that\u2019ll look chic in any space with its smooth tapered legs that celebrate the natural grain of the ash. But don\u2019t let its delicate frame fool you. This is a sturdy and functional furniture piece \u2013 perfect for a busy hallway.\n\nBuy now\n\nTim Fenby Jenson bench, oak and mineral blue: \u00a3199, Made\n\nDimensions: W 158cm x H 44cm x D35cm\n\nThis contemporary long-seater gives a knowing nod to classic mid-century Danish design with its sharp angled frame and tapered legs. Crafted to complement the dining table and chairs in the same range, the solid oak bench makes for a classy addition to an eat-in kitchen, yet awards a formal dining space a laid-back aesthetic \u2013 casual dining with style. We loved its removable cushion for easy washing, which comes in the distinctly mid-century muted shades of mineral blue and revival orange.\n\nBuy now\n\nLoaf bumpkin kitchen bench: \u00a3445, Loaf\n\nDimensions: W 150cm x H 35cm x D50cm\n\nIf this piece reminds you of your old PE class, there\u2019s good reason. The bench takes its design cue from the leather gym horses we all had to fling ourselves from gracelessly, and for that we\u2019re fond of its form \u2013 who doesn\u2019t love a touch of old school nostalgia in their kitchen furniture? The long pale leather seat (which promises to age beautifully), is supported by an obviously sturdy and solid wooden frame with a natural timber finish. Utilitarian style meets contemporary luxe.\n\nBuy now\n\nRaft standard bench: From \u00a3346, Raft\n\nDimensions: From W100cm x H47cm x D30cm\n\nAnother unfussy design that allows both the craftsmanship and natural material to shine is this rustic bench from Raft. It\u2019s made from 100 per cent reclaimed teak, awarding it extra points for sustainability. Really impressive is that it\u2019s available in a choice of seven lengths, from 100cm up to 160cm, meaning you can rest assured it\u2019ll fit your space with the perfect dimensions \u2013 why not choose a shorter style you can tuck under the kitchen table to save on precious square footage?\n\nBuy now\n\nAtkin & Thyme Berkeley bench: \u00a3299, Atkin & Thyme\n\nDimensions: W 148cm x H 48cm x D40cm\n\nWith its unusual oblong shaping, slender iron frame, and plush upholstered seat pad, this is a luxury version of the humble bench. It\u2019s designed to complement the brand\u2019s Berkeley marble dining table but of course, this one would look as much at home furnishing an opulent dressing room or walk-in wardrobe. We loved the subtle gold accents on the legs, awarding it a refined and understated glamour. If you like the idea of a dining bench, but want to keep the look on the formal side, this is the furniture piece for you.\n\nBuy now\n\nB&Q Denia wooden backless dining bench: \u00a355, B&Q\n\nDimensions: W 160cm x H 45cm x D35.5cm\n\nIf it\u2019s well made and looks the part, a simple wooden bench doesn\u2019t have to cost the earth \u2013 by its very nature this humble furniture piece is all about streamlined functionality. B&Q\u2019s offering is made from FSC-certified acacia wood \u2013 a reliable hardwood that\u2019s as much suited to the outdoors as our kitchen or dining spaces. We were impressed with the satin-like finish on this slatted bench \u2013 a product that looks much more expensive than it is, and who could argue with that?\n\nBuy now\n\nIkea norraker bench, birch: \u00a340, Ikea\n\nDimensions: W 103cm x H 45cm x D29cm\n\nAnother purse-friendly option comes in the shape of this solid birch bench from Ikea. A snip at just \u00a340, our most affordable long-seater on the list boasts gently curved corners \u2013 ideal for those with accident-prone toddlers; natural Scandinavian charm with its super light wood that shows off the natural grain beautifully; and, impressively, the fact that it\u2019s been tested for public use. We\u2019re pretty sure it\u2019ll withstand more than a few lively family dinners. Pale and practical.\n\nBuy now\n\nMaisons du Monde Colorado anthracite grey faux suede two seater day bed: \u00a3285, Maisons du Monde\n\nDimensions: W 101.5cm x H 47cm x D40.5cm\n\nInspired by the Japanese lifestyle trend of wabi-sabi \u2013 a philosophy that celebrates the naturally imperfect \u2013 this sturdy two-seater is crafted from warming mango wood with a faux suede upholstered seat pad (also not unlike a traditional gym horse), and it\u2019s a heady mix of materials. Comfy and robust in equal measure, the handsome bench doubles as a handy shoe rack with a nifty storage shelf, making it an ideal furniture piece for the hallway. Top marks for first impressions.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: benches\n\nNoa & Nani\u2019s Nordic bench in white and dark pine is a versatile number that marries Scandi chic with just a touch of the industrial and a smart finish with an attractive visual contrast.
