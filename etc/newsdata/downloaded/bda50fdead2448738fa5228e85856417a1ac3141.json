Wisconsin public health officials said last month that 89 per cent of the people they interviewed who fell ill reported using vaping devices to inhale THC.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

They're subject to minimal safety standards and oversights, exposing users to dangerous chemicals ... and they are getting into the hands of more and more young people,\" Mr Wyden said.\n\nThe American Vaping Association said in a statement that vaping products are \"far less harmful than smoking\" and have helped people break their addiction to traditional cigarettes.\n\nMost experts agree the aerosol in e-cigarettes is less harmful than traditional cigarette smoke because it does not contain most of the cancer-causing by-products of burning tobacco.\n\nHowever, health experts say nicotine is harmful to developing brains and researchers worry that addicted teens could eventually switch from vaping to smoking.\n\nThere is also virtually no research on the long-term effects of the vaping chemicals, some of which are toxic.\n\nAgencies contributed to this report", "description": "A second person has died from a severe respiratory illness that could be linked to vaping, according to\u00a0health officials in the US state of Oregon.\u00a0 The deceased\u00a0had recently used an electronic cigarette containing marijuana oil from a legal dispensary, they said.", "authors": ["Conrad Duncan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/05/08/vaping-deaths.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
