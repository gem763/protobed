Set in 1981 during the country\u2019s border conflict with communist-backed Angola, Oliver Hermanus\u2019s film manages an unflinching portrait of a society in spasm; paranoid and brutish and largely screaming at itself. It\u2019s a war story of sorts in which the battle has already been lost.\n\nKai Luke Brummer gives a fine performance as Nicholas, a willowy 18-year-old at a sun-blasted army boot-camp. Nick and his fellow soldiers are supposed to be fighting the enemy, but the only action they\u2019re seeing is on the volleyball court, or the dorm, or sometimes in the toilet cubicle, much to the sergeant\u2019s horror. The way the officers see it, the very worst thing a soldier can be is a \u201cmoffie\u201d, an Afrikaans insult that the subtitles translate as \u201cfaggot\u201d. \u201cMoffie!\u201d they scream \u2013 as though they regard homosexuality as a mad dog that has somehow got under the fence, or an invading swarm of wasps, liable to sting any man who isn\u2019t properly covered up.\n\nNick has a porn mag, which surely means he\u2019s protected. But he\u2019s also drawn to handsome, sophisticated Staffen (Ryan de Villiers), who helps him dig a trench. But men have orders to remain in the pit until dawn. It\u2019s cold and it\u2019s wet. They\u2019re only snuggling up to keep warm.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tension \u2026 Kai Luke Brummer and Ryan de Villiers. Photograph: Daniel Rutland Manners\n\nHermanus, a black South African film-maker, has said that he initially balked at the prospect of making a film about the plight of his nation\u2019s white minority. But he was swayed by the power of Andre-Carl van der Murwe\u2019s memoir (Moffie\u2019s source material) and by an unexpected sense of kinship with the desperate duo at its centre. Without ever glossing over South Africa\u2019s culture of institutionalised racism, Hermanus suggests that its rampant homophobia is creating its share of casualties too.\n\nStaffen, for starters, will not be tolerated. \u201cHe\u2019s a piece of shit,\u201d says the sergeant; he\u2019s contaminating the barracks. But after the boy is shipped off for re-education, Nicholas is left turning in circles, exposed beneath the big bruised skies, only dimly aware that he is about to be deployed. Meanwhile Moffie maintains its own holding pattern, ratcheting up the tension and wringing optimum menace from the conscripts\u2019 simmering levels of boredom as Braam du Toit\u2019s superb atonal soundtrack hints at mounting psychological unease. Hermanus favours handheld cameras, brought in so close to the actors that every sudden movement, however mundane, carries the threat of violence and you\u2019re never entirely sure whether somebody is about to be punched or kissed \u2013 nor which outcome would be the more disastrous.\n\nMoffie is measured, remorseless; it crawls right under your skin. By the time these virgin soldiers are removed from the barracks, sent into the rushes where the enemy lies in wait, it almost comes as a sweet relief.", "description": "Hidden passions add to the brutish hell of apartheid-era South African conscripts in Oliver Hermanus\u2019s skilfully tense drama", "authors": ["Xan Brooks"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/134a03453769f755ad398d807e99e2160f987889/0_0_8333_4999/master/8333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=680481a85cf01c74cd11e0ca6273f887"}
