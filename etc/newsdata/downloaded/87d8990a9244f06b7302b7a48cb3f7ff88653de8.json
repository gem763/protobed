Such quicker, less expensive post-secondary alternatives include fast-paced \u201cbootcamps\u201d and training programs designed to prepare students directly for tech jobs, as well as income sharing-based education models like Lambda School\u2019s coding program.\n\nAs Craig argues, Gen Z has already shirked the burden of large, upfront investments in favor of cheaper, bite-sized products and services that cater directly to their needs of the moment. We don\u2019t expect a generation who can summon a ride with an app to purchase cars, so why should we expect them to pour tens of thousands into a four-year liberal arts education when there are faster, cheaper, more refined paths that will likely lead to better-paying jobs?\n\nAlong with the death of the bachelor\u2019s degree, Craig also predicts the modern return of apprenticeships \u2014 programs offered by staffing and service providers as an entry-level alternative to a college degree. \u201cIt\u2019s logical that the largest apprenticeship providers will be those with a commercial incentive to scale the production and through-putting of purpose-trained, entry-level talent for clients facing talent shortages,\u201d writes Craig, adding that he expects \u201capprenticeships of various flavors to emerge as a viable and scalable alternative to college as a first pathway to a good job in growth sectors.\u201d\n\nThe result, according to Craig, will not be a reduction in post-secondary education, but rather a much-needed shift in the ways it is served and consumed.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at Harvard Business Review", "description": "Faster and cheaper pathways to employment are expected to rise in popularity among members of the youngest generation poised to enter the workforce.", "authors": ["Kayla Kibbe"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GenZ_Bachelors_Degree.jpg?fit=1200%2C800", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
