It was heading northeast, packing winds of 108 kilometers (66 miles) per hour.\n\nThe agency said the storm could dump up to 300 millimeters (1 foot) of rain in central Japan by Tuesday evening.\n\nAnother storm is expected to hit near southern Japan later this week.\n\nRisks of flooding in the regions hit by the recent typhoon are much higher, the agency said, urging residents in those areas to prepare early.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis, which hit Japan earlier this month, left at least 70 people dead and 12 others missing, officials said. Japan's Kyodo News agency, citing its own tally, put the death toll at 81. Nagano in central Japan and Fukushima and Miyagi in the north were among the hardest-hit areas.\n\nThe typhoon dumped record rainfalls in large areas of central and northern Japan, causing dozens of rivers to overflow, triggering mudslides and leaving tens of thousands of homes flooded, damaged or without power or running water.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
