His campaign is going forward with a $1.3 million TV ad buy in Iowa, the crucial early voting state that will kick off the Democratic primary contest in February.\n\nSanders cleared his previously frenetic campaign schedule after a heart attack on Oct. 1 at a time when his candidacy has already been eclipsed by fellow liberal Elizabeth Warren\u2019s ascent as a chief contender to early front-runner Joe Biden, who is 76.\n\nAt 78, Sanders is the oldest of the 19 Democrats seeking the party\u2019s nomination to take on Republican President Donald Trump, 73, in the November 2020 election.\n\n\u201cThat question starts to creep into people\u2019s minds in terms of, \u2018Is this guy going to be around for eight years after the election?\u2019\u201d said Bret Nilles, Democratic chair of Iowa\u2019s Linn County.\n\nSanders, who has been recovering at his home in Burlington, Vermont, since his heart attack, will hold a \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d rally at Queensbridge Park in New York on Oct. 19, his first rally in nearly three weeks.\n\nOn Tuesday, he will appear alongside 11 other Democratic candidates who qualified for the fourth primary debate in Ohio, when voters in Iowa will be watching Sanders\u2019 performance closely, Nilles said.\n\nA raft of TV ads - postponed for several days when Sanders was hospitalized - began airing on Oct. 8 in Iowa, at a cost of $1.3 million, underscoring the campaign\u2019s spending power after raising more cash than any other candidate in the third quarter.\n\nPhone volunteers also made about 800,000 calls to early voting states including Iowa in the four days after Sanders health scare was reported, campaign officials said.\n\n\u201cThe rest of the campaign and the volunteers took it upon themselves to double down on their effort and their energy,\u201d said Sanders\u2019 campaign manager Faiz Shakir.\n\n\u201cThey really said, \u2018Senator Sanders, we\u2019ve got you on this\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe response was a sign of the passion his loyal supporters feel for the democratic socialist\u2019s agenda of reorienting the U.S. economy against corporate power and tackling rising inequality with measures like expanding government-run healthcare.\n\nBut doubts over his health could make it more challenging to pick up new supporters. Many national polls in recent weeks have already shown U.S. Senator Warren of Massachusetts, who is 70, pulling ahead of Sanders into second place behind Biden.\n\n\u2018READY TO GO FULL BLAST\u2019\n\nShakir, the campaign manager, said Sanders would show during Tuesday\u2019s debate he was \u201con the path to a full recovery\u201d.\n\nSome had been writing off Sanders\u2019 campaign from the start, ignoring the large numbers of people donating to and volunteering for the campaign, he said.\n\nSanders raised $25.3 million from 1.4 million individual donations in the last quarter, exceeding Warren\u2019s $24.6 million raised from 943,000 donations.\n\nWithin days of his campaign launch in February, Sanders has said more than 1 million people volunteered. His campaign boasts 25,000 organizers and volunteers in Iowa alone. Other campaigns have not disclosed comparable figures.\n\nSanders told CNN on Thursday he would soon return to campaigning in early primary and caucus states and was \u201cready to go full blast\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling great and we\u2019re going to run a vigorous campaign,\u201d Sanders said.\n\n\u2018DECIDE FOR HIMSELF\u2019\n\nGrant Woodard, who has served on several Democratic campaigns and works as a lawyer in Iowa, said while Sanders might not be leading in polls his campaign boasts an impressive network in the state.\n\n\u201cI think some people wanted to try to dismiss what happened here last time as a fluke,\u201d said Woodard, referring to the 2016 Iowa caucuses where Sanders came close to beating the eventual nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s still attracting very large crowds. His supporters are very red hot in their support of him.\u201d\n\nIn Iowa, the campaign said Sanders staffers and volunteers continued to canvass voters and knock doors even as the candidate was in hospital.\n\nBut fired up volunteers might not be enough for the campaign to stand out in the historically large Democratic primary field, said Elesha Gayman, chair of the Democratic party in Iowa\u2019s Scott County.\n\nGeorganne Guillen, a Sanders supporter in southern California, said she worried for Sanders\u2019 candidacy after his heart attack, but trusted the senator to decide for himself whether he was still capable of running for president.\n\n\u201cI believe that he cares enough about the country to put the country first,\u201d she said, \u201cand he won\u2019t try to pursue something that he doesn\u2019t think he can\u2019t see through.\u201d", "description": "With all campaign events canceled after an unexpected heart surgery and nothing scheduled until Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate, Bernie Sanders' campaign has been seeking to reassure supporters the 78-year-old senator is still a viable presidential pick.", "authors": ["Simon Lewis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440678336&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0S9", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
