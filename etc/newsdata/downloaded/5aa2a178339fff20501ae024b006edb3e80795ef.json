But Justice Flick said he would have to stump up for more than the standard costs after making an indemnity order.\n\nThe judge explained that Bellino had refused a \"Calderbank\" offer in January of $80,000, inclusive of his costs and disbursements. The paper would have also published an apology for calling him a brothel owner.\n\n\"Queensland Newspapers contend that Mr Bellino\u2019s failure to accept the offer made was 'imprudent or plainly unreasonable',\" Justice Flick said. \"That submission is accepted.\"\n\n\"The offer on any view was a sensible 'commercial' resolution of the dispute between the parties at the time it was made \u2013 Queensland Newspapers on the one hand wishing to limit (inter alia) its own exposure to forthcoming legal costs and, on the other hand, the wish of Mr Bellino to obtain some personal redress.\"\n\nGiven the Courier was represented by Ashurst and top defo silk Tom Blackburn, there won't be much change out of $400,000.\n\nTalk about a roll of the dice coming up snake eyes.\n\nRush a big hit\n\nThe Geoffrey Rush v Daily Telegraph defamation stoush goes into extra time next month when Federal Court full bench hears the paper's appeal over two days in Sydney. (One of those days being Melbourne Cup day.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn-line hit: Geoffrey Rush during his defamation trial Nick Moir\n\nThe court established an online file for the case and the numbers are eye-popping. There were more than 36,000 page views and 11,000 \"entrances\" (unique visitors) who spent an average of just over two minutes taking in the uploaded documents and transcripts.\n\nA court spokesman said the case had \"easily attracted the greatest number of hits\" for an online file.\n\n\"It is gratifying to see the public taking an interest in such a matter and learning more about how the process works.\u201d\n\nLaw Council on Pexa warpath\n\nLaw council president Arthur Moses, SC, will take industry concerns about the inter-operability of the PEXA online conveyancing platform into a meeting with the NSW government next week.\n\nMoses says inter-operability in the e-conveyancing market \"is highly preferable and should be implemented nationally\".\n\n\"At present, true competition is not available in this market,'' he said in a letter to NSW Attorney-General Mark Speakman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"As a result of electronic conveyancing having become mandatory for the majority of land transactions in NSW and Victoria, the Law Council believes that state and federal governments must address, as a matter of urgency, the need for inter-operability between electronic lodgement network operators.\"\n\nBonding over Iced VoVos\n\nThe very sad passing of former Federal Court judge Richard Tracey in California last Friday spurred some magnificent tributes this week.\n\nToo soon: the late Richard Tracey on his retirement from the bench. Wayne Taylor\n\nTracey took on the taxing role as chairman of the aged care inquiry last December, but was diagnosed with terminal skin cancer eight weeks ago.\n\nIt was mightily unfair that it struck so soon into his post-judicial life, with the judge only taking his leave of the court after 11 years in July 2018.\n\nHe was a popular figure at the Federal Court and there were some smiles at the commission hearing on Monday as commissioner Lynelle Briggs lamented his passing.\n\n\"I loved working with him. It was a genuine partnership,\" she said.\n\n\"You could say that we bonded over morning teas, simple sandwiches, great fish meals, and Iced VoVo biscuits, which Richard lavishly shared with all the staff in the royal commission.\"", "description": "Hearsay: Tony Bellino's costly decision, Rush a big hit and an Iced VoVo tribute.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6056%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_188/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ccf634bead2f7828601739217702887f34548ecb", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
