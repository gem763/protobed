The Washington Post reported last week that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate a company with ties to Hunter Biden, and the call between Trump and Zelensky is the subject of an extraordinary whistleblower complaint.\n\n\u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place, was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cAnd Ukraine, Ukraine\u2019s got a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nTrump has denied that he has done anything untoward in his conversations with world leaders and had previously declined to say whether he spoke with Zelensky about Biden.\n\nThe president\u2019s apparent confirmation that he mentioned Biden on the call came as his allies scrambled to deny that he did so.\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said there is \u201cno direct evidence\u201d that Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden or his family, saying the allegation is \u201cbased on hearsay reports.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just frankly can\u2019t imagine why people have lost their minds so much over these daily reports of one thing or another that seem to consume everybody\u2019s attention in the news coverage,\u201d Cornyn told reporters ahead of Trump\u2019s event in Houston.\n\nOn NBC News\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin repeatedly declined to say whether it was appropriate for the president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival and suggested that Trump did not pressure Zelensky.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re speculating that the president pressured. I don\u2019t have any reason to believe that the president pressured\u2026 in any way,\u201d Mnuchin said.\n\nRudolph W. Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, said in a phone call with The Washington Post Sunday morning that he has been \u201cworking for months for this moment\u201d and this week will \u201ckeep pushing and pushing\u201d to highlight the Biden family\u2019s finances. He alluded to new materials he may cite this week, but declined to offer specifics.\n\nWhen asked if Trump has given Giuliani\u2019s efforts his blessing, Giuliani said, \u201cI don\u2019t do anything that involves my client without speaking with my client.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Biden, who is leading in polls for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, swung back at Trump and challenged the president to release a transcript of his phone call with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s doing this because he knows I will beat him like a drum and is using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try and smear,\u201d Biden told reporters at the Polk County, Iowa, Steak Fry.\n\nNews of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky came to light after an intelligence official whistleblower shared with the intelligence agency\u2019s inspector general that the official had heard Trump make a promise to a foreign leader that wasn\u2019t appropriate.\n\nSubsequent reporting has found that the call was with Ukraine and related to Trump\u2019s desire to get dirt on his possible political opponent. Congress has not been provided a copy of the actual complaint filed by the whistleblower.\n\nTrump also on Sunday took aim at Biden for saying that he never spoke with his son about his overseas business dealings, telling reporters, \u201cI mean, give me a break.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden did,\u201d Trump said, repeating his attacks on the Biden\u2019s family business dealings. \u201cAnd then he said he never spoke to his son. Does anybody believe that one?\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that he did not speak to his son, Donald Trump Jr., in advance about a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting at which Russians had offered to provide dirt on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump administration officials and Republican lawmakers defended the president and sought to place the focus on Biden in appearances on the Sunday morning news shows.\n\nIn his \u201cMeet the Press\u201d interview, Mnuchin argued that rather than focusing on \u201cconfidential discussions\u201d between two world leaders, \u201cI really think that the real issue here is not what the president said but what indeed did Biden\u2019s son do.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked during an interview on CBS News\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d whether he believes it\u2019s appropriate for Giuliani to be \u201cinserting himself into foreign affairs like this.\u201d\n\nIn meetings overseas with Ukrainian officials, Giuliani has pushed for reopening an investigation of a gas company that had hired Hunter Biden to serve as a board member and adviser while his father was U.S. vice president.\n\nPompeo responded that \u201cif there was election interference that took place by the vice president, I think the American people deserve to know.\u201d\n\n.@margbrennan asked @SecPompeo if it was appropriate for @RudyGiuliani to call for a Biden investigation, and Pompeo said, \u201cIf there was election interference that took place by the Vice President, I think the American people deserve to know.\u201d pic.twitter.com/zlUC3akIi3 \u2014 Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) September 22, 2019\n\nHe declined to say whether he has personally asked Zelensky to open an investigation or whether the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine is involved in supporting Giuliani\u2019s efforts.\n\nIn an appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Giuliani repeatedly took aim at the former vice president and his family, at one point referencing Hunter Biden\u2019s struggle with addiction and mental health.\n\n\u201cThe kid, unfortunately, is a drug addict,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nThe former vice president has spoken openly about his son\u2019s struggles, including in a CNN interview that aired days after the New Yorker published a lengthy story about Hunter Biden in July.\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) called for the Justice Department to play a role in the matter, arguing that it should \u201cdo for the Biden-Ukraine connection\u201d what was done for the Trump-Russia connection, in a reference to former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s Russia probe.\n\n\u201cWhat role did the Bidens play? ... There\u2019s enough smoke here,\u201d Graham said on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\nPhilip Rucker, Robert Costa, Colby Itkowitz, Matt Zapotosky, Jonathan O\u2019Connell and Rachael Bade contributed to this report.", "description": "The statement comes amid swirling questions about whether Trump sought to use his influence to seek reelection help from a foreign country.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4qahJfYiOJIref7sQF9uDdXdxS4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/47ETJWW5H4I6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
