Unfortunately we didn't use the fundamental advantage we had in the first half and the Samoans were really putting away the chances they would get.\n\n\"It's a great experience for all the boys, an outstanding performance from everyone again tonight.\"\n\nRussia's Tagir Gadzhiev takes a breather during a tough battle with Samoa.\n\nReferees must improve\n\nFormer Samoa international Daniel Leo tweeted that his compatriots had been lucky not to be sent off.\n\n\"Love Samoa and our intent but that's very lucky not to be red,\" he wrote on Twitter\n\nReferees had already been under scrutiny at the tournament, with World Rugby releasing a statement on the matter as the Pool A game began in the Kumagaya Stadium.\n\n\"Following the usual review of matches, the match officials team recognize that performances over the opening weekend of Rugby World Cup 2019 were not consistently of the standards set by World Rugby and themselves,\" the statement read.\n\n\"But World Rugby is confident of the highest standards of officiating moving forward.\"\n\nSamoa turn up after break\n\nDespite some teams yet to play an opening game in Japan, the Russians were taking on their second opponent of the tournament having been beaten by the hosts 30-10 on Friday\n\nWith just three days of rest between matches, the novice side was always going to be tested against a Samoan outfit determined to make a positive start to its campaign.\n\nAmid all the first-half drama, it was Russia which found itself ahead but Samoa eventually showed its superior class after the restart.\n\nAfaesetiti Amosa powered over the line to move Samoa back in front before a brace from Ed Fidow all but settled the encounter.\n\nLee-Lo also found himself on the score sheet for Samoa to rub further salt into Russia's wounds and a late try from Alapati Leiua further extended the Pacific Islanders' lead.\n\nThe second half was not without controversy though and this time it was a Russian player who lucky to avoid a red card.\n\nRussian prop Kirill Gotovtsev was sent to the sin bin after going in dangerously on Amosa as the Samoan dipped to the try line.", "description": "Samoa opened its Rugby World Cup campaign with a fiery bonus-point victory against Russia on Tuesday but the match will be remembered for a succession of brutal hits by the eventual winners.", "authors": ["Ben Church"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190924125942-samoa-tease-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
