This will lead to more production because of this pricing and safety advantage, and also due to the fact that older, highly polluting cars, will be replaced by new, extremely environmentally friendly cars. There will be very little difference in emissions between the California Standard and the new U.S. Standard, but the cars will be far safer and much less expensive. Many more cars will be produced under the new and uniform standard, meaning significantly more JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to California, you will be out of business.\"\n\nWhy it matters: California wants to keep toughening the rules \u2014 which by proxy means tougher mileage mandates \u2014 in a way that's almost as strict as the national Obama-era standards they were following.\n\nBut the White House is moving ahead with plans to freeze the Obama administration's federal emissions and mileage rules instead of allowing them to keep tightening.\n\nCalifornia is certain to battle the effort in court once it's finalized.\n\nThe big picture: California is the nation's largest auto market and roughly a dozen other states plan to follow California's emissions standards. This all has the auto industry fearful of a split national market.\n\nQuick take: The EPA move could snuff out any hope automakers might have of avoiding a bitter legal fight between the administration and California that ensures ongoing uncertainty about standards \u2014 one where they're caught in the middle.\n\nThe bottom line: \"This will be the biggest fight in environmental law since the Clean Power Plan. Maybe bigger,\" Nathan Richardson of the University of South Carolina School of Law, said via Twitter.\n\nThe intrigue: The political landscape could shift quickly if a Democrat wins the White House, but that's hardly a guarantee of smooth sailing for the industry either.", "description": "California is certain to battle the effort in court.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/z2vYAEvmZH9CpQUCgBwivTViIOk=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/09/18/1568815518022.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
