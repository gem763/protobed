On the other hand, after an 8% rally from September\u2019s low, potential gains versus the dollar may also be limited.\n\nIn fact, for all the recent volatility, the pound is slap bang on its average level since the Brexit referendum in 2016. A crash-out scenario is unlikely even if an election is called to resolve a parliamentary deadlock because Johnson was obliged to ask for an extension to the Oct. 31 deadline. But there\u2019s a long way to go before the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU is resolved, limiting the pound\u2019s potential to climb far from its current $1.30 level.\n\n\u201cWe think could reach $1.32-$1.34 if the deal is passed in the second reading,\u201d said Petr Krpata, a currency strategist at ING Bank, referring to the first vote Tuesday. \u201cBut even if passed there is still the risk that the whole thing won\u2019t get eventually through. That\u2019s why sterling at something like $1.40 on the back of the deal being passed this week looks aggressive.\u201d\n\nU.K. lawmakers will hold two votes on Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal Tuesday evening, the first around 7 p.m. London time on whether they approve of the substance of the bill and the second at 7:15 p.m. on the timetable for pushing it through Parliament. Losing the 7 p.m. vote would kill the bill while losing the subsequent Program Motion would simply make it very hard to hit Johnson\u2019s deadline for the end of the month.\n\nOvernight volatility on the pound shows the risk of a sharp move is easing and options suggest the upper limit of gains for now could be around $1.3150. That\u2019s below longer-term forecasts from banks including NatWest Markets and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ). that see a potential rally to $1.35 on the Brexit deal being approved.\n\nFuture constraints\n\nBeyond that, it may be hard to bet with conviction on sterling\u2019s outlook, given a Brexit deal will only open the door for a new round of negotiations on the future trading relationship between the U.K. and EU.\n\nMeanwhile, an election isn\u2019t off the table if Johnson unexpectedly fails to win backing for his deal Tuesday, or his timeline is blocked and he pulls his plan in protest. He leads in polls and may be able to win with a larger majority to push his deal through -- although that\u2019s by no means a certainty.\n\n\u201cOverall downside remains substantially smaller than a no-deal outcome,\u201d according to Jeremy Stretch, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. An election before year-end could send the toward $1.24, a 4% drop from current levels, according to Stretch.\n\nThat compares with a drop of 14% to $1.11 if there were a no-deal Brexit, based on a Bloomberg survey of analysts earlier this month.", "description": "Pound Paths Are Narrowing as Traders Await Key Brexit Deal Votes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic89c9b648eb50a06525f177850e21625f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
