Netflix has announced it\u2019s picked up Jeff Smith\u2019s award-winning series, with plans to turn it into a kids\u2019 show on the streaming platform.\n\nAs reported by Deadline, Smith\u2019s Bone will be turned into an animated kids\u2019 show on Netflix, with Smith himself coming on to helm the project. This comes a couple of years after Warner Bros. tried and failed to make a film adaptation with The Little Prince\u2019s Mark Osborn, which had apparently been in the works for a while. Bone was an independent comic series that ran from 1991 to 2004, gaining a devoted following and becoming the first graphic novel to launch Scholastic\u2019s Graphix Books imprint.\n\nThe series stars three cousins \u2014 Fone Bone, Smiley Bone, and Phoney Bone \u2014 who find themselves in the middle of a mysterious, fantastical valley after being forcibly driven from their hometown of Boneville. The three cousins haplessly become heroes for the valley as they navigate a series of strange and unusual trials, with the threat of the Lord of the Locusts looming above them. It was praised for its unique world, gorgeous artistry, and the way it called back to traditional comic strips in both story and style.\n\nNo expected release date has been announced, but we\u2019ll bring you more on Netflix\u2019s plans for the seminal series as we learn them.", "description": "Bone, the graphic novel series about a trio of cousins and unlikely heroes, is finally getting adapted onscreen.
