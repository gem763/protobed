It also claims that Trump's due process rights are being violated.", "description": "The White House declared it will halt any and all cooperation with what it termed the \"illegitimate\" impeachment probe by House Democrats, sharpening the constitutional clash between President Donald Trump and Congress.", "authors": ["Our Foreign Staff", "Laura Freeman", "Owen Paterson", "Con Coughlin"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000212341287-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
