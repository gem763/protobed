CEO Steve Huffman isn\u2019t holding his breath.", "language": "en", "text": "The Reddit community /r/The_Donald is a perpetual online rally in support of President Trump, but last month, Reddit decided to put the group in \u201cquarantine\u201d for hosting and not acting on violent threats on police officers and public officials in Oregon.\n\n\u201cQuarantining\u201d does not prevent people from reading or contributing to /r/The_Donald, but it asks new visitors if they\u2019re sure they want to check it out, and a notice at the top of the page reminds everyone to be on better behavior. On the latest episode of Recode Decode With Kara Swisher, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the goal of the restriction was to put /r/The_Donald on notice but give them a chance to change.\n\nBut so far, he\u2019s not been convinced that the quarantine should be lifted. And in the context of the quasi-violent tone of Trump\u2019s real rallies, he\u2019s not surprised.\n\n\u201cIn order for that to happen, we would have to see a real, concerted effort to make a change and ownership of this challenge. I haven\u2019t seen it yet,\u201d Huffman said. \u201cSo this gets back to my point of, if they are a self-described never-ending rally for the president and we can all see the behavior of people at those rallies and this is a digital version of that, I think they have their work cut out for them.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Huffman said he would have banned the group if he thought it was impossible to save because \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste time on something that\u2019s inevitable\u201d \u2014 and clearly, that hasn\u2019t happened yet. On top of that, he said he wants to make sure Trump\u2019s nonviolent supporters aren\u2019t being unfairly restricted from expressing their views.\n\n\u201cPolitical speech is amongst the most sacred in our country, and we do believe that, and removing a community that represents political views of a large percentage of our population I think is deeply problematic,\u201d Huffman said. \u201cBut at the same time, it doesn\u2019t mean a community can use that as a shield to behave dangerously.\u201d\n\nYou can listen to Recode Decode wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, and TuneIn.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ve shared a lightly edited full transcript of Kara\u2019s conversation with Steve.\n\nKara Swisher: Steve and I have done interviews several times, and we were going to tape this in our studio at Vox Media, but I thought ... One of the things that I like is a live audience, and Steve is ... Not everybody can do a live audience very easily or be very interesting, but Steve is absolutely a terrific interview.\n\nWe\u2019ve done many over the years, and I thought he would be great. It was either him or a venture capitalist from Andreessen Horowitz, and I can tell you, you don\u2019t want to see that live. He was great. He was great, but, really, you don\u2019t want to hear about cap tables, I think, right now, which was fascinating to me \u2014 not really, but sort of.\n\nIn any case, Steve obviously is one of the founders, a longtime entrepreneur, founder of ... He did Hipmunk. He did all kinds of companies. But the most famous, obviously, is Reddit, which he ... How many of you co-founders ... You and Alexis?\n\nSteve Huffman: It was Alexis and I, technically.\n\nRight.\n\nTwo of us, and then Aaron Swartz and Chris Slowe, who\u2019s our CTO now, joined us about six months later.\n\nAnyway, co-founder of Reddit, which I think is a very well-known site and service and communication service. How do you call it? What do you call Reddit now?\n\nThat\u2019s actually a really good question. I definitely use the line that we\u2019re \u201cnot social media.\u201d\n\nOkay. Good thing these days.\n\nRight? But the idea that we\u2019re either a tech company or a media company ... I think the reality is we\u2019re both, and this is probably one of those questions that I\u2019ll have a better answer maybe 10 years from now, looking back. But my honest answer is I don\u2019t know, somewhere in between.\n\nSomewhere in between. All right. So I want to ... Very quickly, for those who aren\u2019t familiar ... I think most people are familiar with Reddit, and most people ... Show of hands who are familiar with Reddit and how it works. Okay, everybody. You came back how many years ago?\n\nFour years. Four years last week.\n\nYou came back and started off to try to figure out what went wrong with Reddit, really, and try to fix it, or what was the ...\n\nWell, yeah, I mean, my mentality was twofold.\n\nYou had left.\n\nI had left Reddit. So I was with Reddit for the first five years. Then I left for five years, and I was slinging plane tickets at Hipmunk. Coming back to Reddit, I had mixed feelings because, in some sense, yes, there was an aspect of, \u201cCan we fix Reddit?\u201d\n\nBut really, what was behind that was ... I think and I thought \u2014 I do now and thought then \u2014 Reddit is a truly incredible place and an incredible thing. It, unfortunately, wasn\u2019t known as such. Maybe for our core users, but popularly, not known as such. It was actively committing suicide, is how I viewed it at the time.\n\nWhy do you say that? Because ...\n\nWell, part of it was getting up the motivation to actually come back, right? We have to tell ourselves these stories. So I was like, \u201cIf I don\u2019t come back, it\u2019s going to die.\u201d\n\nNow, whether that was true or not, I would say we were doing, very efficiently, the checklist of things a company would do to kill themselves. We weren\u2019t hiring. We were in the press for all of the wrong reasons. Our users were in open revolt. The employee morale was very low. The product wasn\u2019t changing.\n\nSo, a lot of things going wrong. What was going right is that we were growing. So this is one of the things that just from a pure business point of view, made me then and continues to make me really optimistic about Reddit, is that, even during our darkest days, we were growing, which means something is working.\n\nRight. So something is working. You were at the front end, I would say, sort of the John the Baptist of really awful internet memes, really awful conversations, racism, sexism, things like that, way before this was a thing that sort of infected all the other sites. Talk about how that occurred. I know you don\u2019t agree with everything. There\u2019s tons of great stuff on Reddit. I know that. I know that. But a lot of the ones that were more controversial were terrible.\n\nIt is true, the ones that were more controversial were terrible. I wouldn\u2019t say we pioneered any of these things.\n\nNo, no, no. No, I don\u2019t mean to say ... But you got the attention for this way before everybody else. Reddit was the first site that got most of the attention around this.\n\nFairly or not, we got a lot of attention for this.\n\nOkay.\n\nThat was troubling \u2014 both the fact that it existed and that\u2019s what we were known for.\n\nRight.\n\nBecause, again, then and even less so now, we\u2019re talking about actually a very small percentage of our users who had a disproportionately loud voice.\n\nOne of the things that\u2019s changed over the years at Reddit \u2014 and it\u2019s been a personal learning of mine and for the company \u2014 is when we started Reddit, the idea behind Reddit is that this will be a real place. This is a bullshit-free place. It came from a point of view of, \u201cMarketing is lying to me. The media is lying to me. Everything is kind of manicured and just not real.\u201d\n\nGatekeepers.\n\n\u201cAnd we want a place that\u2019s actually real.\u201d\n\nRight.\n\nSo we had this idea \u2014 and we more or less enforced it in the beginning \u2014 is we\u2019re not going to remove things. So, for the most part, this meant we\u2019re not going to remove content. We actually didn\u2019t even really even have spam, let alone hate. It mostly meant we\u2019d let swear words survive and content critical of us.\n\nBut that did lend a certain amount of authenticity to Reddit. And so it\u2019s easy to say things like, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to remove things,\u201d or some kind of free speech argument when your values aren\u2019t being tested, when it\u2019s easy to say so.\n\nRight.\n\nIt gets a lot more challenging ... and these were in those years, that kind of 2010 to \u201915 era. So I came back in 2015 and we\u2019re immediately wrestling with these issues of, well, we don\u2019t want to remove things. We don\u2019t want to undermine the authenticity of Reddit, but this stuff is wrong. Finding our voice on those issues was a real challenge because we had to really test our values and find ways to justify doing what we knew in our heart to be the right thing, but wasn\u2019t supported by our policies, or wasn\u2019t supported by our previous words. So there was a disconnect there that we had to close.\n\nOne hundred percent. And the reason I\u2019m saying ... I don\u2019t mean to imply that everything on Reddit is awful. That\u2019s not the case. Most of them are wonderful, vibrant communities, but you were the first to see these problems and have to deal with them quickly. This was pre-Donald Trump, pre- a lot of the controversies about white nationalism, Alex Jones, everything else. You all faced it early.\n\nYeah, and one of the reasons for that is that Reddit is, one, well-organized. That is to say, our users self-organize into communities.\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a particular piece of content, whether it was the bad stuff or, more commonly, some really good stuff...\n\nKnitting.\n\nKnitting, actually, is a community I actually really enjoy.\n\nKnitting. Yes.\n\nWe can get into that, I hope.\n\nNo.\n\nI think there\u2019s something really important about the commonality of the human experience that we don\u2019t get to see in our day-to-day lives that might even come through in a community like Knitting. For me, it\u2019s actually the Cross-Stitch community.\n\nOkay. Nevertheless, so Reddit is a little bit different in that it\u2019s well organized, so you can find what you\u2019re looking for, and it\u2019s public. Right? We\u2019re not behind logins. That was very important to us.\n\nRight.\n\nWe\u2019re not behind logins. We\u2019re not in an AI-generated custom feed for you.\n\nRight, news feed.\n\nIt\u2019s really human-powered, and so, for better or for worse, at the time, it created new challenges. But I think, overall, for Reddit, it\u2019s a healthy symptom of the fact that Reddit is a reflection of what\u2019s going on in the world.\n\nBut the challenge was our early internet users were also of the kind of techie, troll-y variety and were adept at manipulating the system and taking advantage of it, whether to spread hate or, more commonly, just to kind of waste everybody\u2019s time.\n\nRight. To be trolls. To make trouble.\n\nYes.\n\nSo talk about when you got back, how you thought to deal with this, because initially it was really up and down for you.\n\nIt was really challenging. I mean, it was within my first week, we were talking about a community whose name I don\u2019t even like to say, but a nasty, racist community, and we\u2019re trying to find the argument for removing them. We went back and forth on this for a couple of weeks, and, finally, I remember ...\n\nWhat were the back-and-forth arguments? See, I would\u2019ve been like, \u201cTake it down.\u201d\n\nWell, that was an argument.\n\nRight.\n\nIt was an argument we all kind of fall back on. It\u2019s like, \u201cWe know what the answer is here. How can we get there?\u201d\n\nRight.\n\nThe challenge is, defining what we\u2019re actually talking about. Is this hate or is it not? These users, we kind of chased them around the site, and they would do really sinister things. For example, communities of news of only black people committing crimes, major news sources, right? No commentary, no anything. So things like that, but we know, \u201cHey, this is wrong.\u201d So, during that discussion, that\u2019s actually where we created the quarantine feature.\n\nI want to get to that, the quarantine.\n\nYeah. It was like, \u201cWe\u2019re not sure quite how to ban it yet or how to justify this, but this is not what we want users seeing. This is not what we want to be representing to the world. So we\u2019re going to put them in this kind of list of sanctions.\u201d Then the day before ...\n\nSo like the Iraqis, but go ahead.\n\nThe day before we applied the quarantining feature, I woke up and I just said, \u201cYou know what? Fundamentally, what this community is doing, amongst other things, is wasting our time. They\u2019re attacking this company. They\u2019re deliberately posting nasty stuff, and then they go to the press, maybe you, \u201cand say, \u2018Hey, look at this nasty stuff on Reddit. Would you write about it?\u2019 They\u2019re doing this to attack our company, to waste our time, to get everybody spun up, and, fundamentally, we just have more important things to worry about.\u201d\n\nWhat we\u2019re trying to do is ... What Reddit does really well is it gives people a sense of community and belonging.\n\nRight.\n\nThat\u2019s the prize. We think that\u2019s an important glue of society, and these people are preventing us from doing that. So you know what? We\u2019re going to ban them. We\u2019re going to ban them on the grounds that they are in the way of our mission. Over the coming months, we refined our content policies, and, even since between you and I last spoke, we\u2019ve made a number of iterations through our policies to kind of provide more clarity on these issues, both for our decision making and for the public.\n\nRight. So when you make these decisions, one of the things that I think Mark Zuckerberg doesn\u2019t want to do, Jack Dorsey, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to decide.\u201d That\u2019s always their fallback position, except that they created it and made it so that ... But they don\u2019t want to take responsibility for the private company that it is and make decisions.\n\nTalk about ... You probably have ... There\u2019s a lot of people ... I know Alexis was like that, your other co-founder. Why is that a mentality that you feel like you don\u2019t want to decide, even though you all created the platforms?\n\nThe challenge here, speaking for Reddit specifically, is that we didn\u2019t create Reddit. Our users created Reddit.\n\nOkay.\n\nWe believe this very strongly, and if we zoom out of Reddit for a second and just talk about the internet, the difference between the internet and the media landscape that existed before it is that, on the internet, everybody has a voice, right? Everybody can share what they know, what they\u2019re thinking, whatever.\n\nThis has been an overwhelmingly positive change, I think, for humanity, right? It has elevated and educated billions of people. At the same time, people will present themselves in ways that might conflict with our values, sometimes very much so, and sometimes in ways where it might be, actually, a simple political disagreement.\n\nSo now we start getting into the discussion of who should choose what people can and can\u2019t say, and I do believe it\u2019s problematic for a private company \u2014 or even worse, me as an individual or, God help us all, the government \u2014 to be deciding what people can and can\u2019t say, which ideas live and survive. We believe that that power really lies within people. So, in the United States, that means all of us. It means publishers and journalists who are really debating these ideas publicly.\n\nThat\u2019s kind of the founding principle of this country, and so, on Reddit, the ideal case is that our users do this, and Reddit, more than the other platforms, much more so, our users do do this.\n\nWell, you can distinguish between Reddit and Facebook, because that\u2019s a highly controlled environment. Even though they\u2019re pretending it\u2019s not, it\u2019s highly controlled in every aspect of it.\n\nRight.\n\nYou sign in. These news feeds are thrown at you. There\u2019s a huge advertising business built on your data. It\u2019s not this, \u201cOh hey, we\u2019re all sort of hippies here,\u201d because someone\u2019s a billionaire and someone isn\u2019t.\n\nThe challenge with Facebook specifically is that the feeds were engineered, not necessarily by people, but by algorithms.\n\nRight.\n\nBy people, I mean employees, and so it was optimizing to the wrong thing. Now we look back, it\u2019s so obvious. Oh, if you\u2019re optimizing for engagement or time on site, the end result is you\u2019re going to get this click-bait-y, angry politics, emotional content. I don\u2019t think there was a moral imperative behind that one way or the other, other than optimizing for time on site and revenue. We are different because our users do that.\n\nSo, while I do think it\u2019s problematic, though obviously not unheard of, we do make decisions on what ... At some level, we have our content policy of what is allowed or not allowed on our site. But, more importantly, our users and moderators do that at a far greater scale. We think that scale is much better. For example, Facebook got in trouble last year, maybe two years ago, when they started deciding which news sources were valid or not.\n\nRight.\n\nRight? They ended up killing a bunch of publications, right? Or putting them on near-death because they just cut off traffic to them.\n\nGoogle\u2019s done that before, too.\n\nYeah, because some decision that somebody made, inadvertent or not ...\n\nNo, Google did it. It was called Aardvark or some stupid childish name they have for ruining people\u2019s businesses.\n\nSo we don\u2019t do that.\n\nThey do. They name it stuff like that. Penguin.\n\nSo we don\u2019t choose which news publications survive or not, but our news communities are amongst the most strictly moderated.\n\nRight.\n\nThey do. /r/News has, actually, a list of publications that are allowed, and only external links are allowed. So the end result is ...\n\nOr think about it this way. Two very different headlines: \u201cReddit bans whatever news source dot-com,\u201d hugely problematic bias, this and that, oh my gosh, the whole world\u2019s on fire. Or \u201cThis community decides to ban it,\u201d fine, whatever, \u201cWe\u2019ll go to a different community.\u201d\n\nRight.\n\nIt\u2019s very different. So we try to work towards how can we empower the users ...\n\n... to make the selections.\n\n... to make the selection, our communities to make the selection, and then grow as many communities as possible.\n\nIn some cases, though, you do have to make the selection.\n\nOf course.\n\nSo talk a little bit about what happened just recently with \u2014 it\u2019s /r/The_Donald, right?\n\nYes.\n\nThe_Donald. Explain.\n\nSo The_Donald is a community on Reddit. They are self-described as a never-ending rally for the president, which I think is important in this context if we just consider the behavior of people at those rallies.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo it\u2019s been a challenge for us, because they ... First of all, Reddit has the far right in The_Donald and the far left and everyone in between. So, I mean, we see that, right? They go after each other. They both go after me. It\u2019s something we\u2019re living fairly viscerally.\n\nThe_Donald, if you asked the far left, that\u2019s where Nazis are born and bred. I think a little bit closer to reality is that their ethos is less in hate and more in pissing off liberals, which is annoying, and they\u2019re really good at it, and it\u2019s not against our content policy.\n\nHowever, we have seen in that community behavior that does violate our content policies. So, in this particular case, we have a policy against inciting or glorifying violence.\n\nRight.\n\nMost recently, there were comments suggesting violence towards police officers \u2014 ironically, given their politics \u2014 in Oregon during that whole thing. We saw some of those comments reported and banned by moderators, which is what we would expect when there\u2019s rule-violating content.\n\nRight.\n\nWe saw other of those comments not reported, therefore not banned and even upvoted. So what we did with quarantining, in this case, is it basically puts a splash page on The_Donald and says, \u201cThere\u2019s violent content here. We expect change,\u201d sends a warning to both the moderators and the community.\n\nSo you put the splash on. You put ... Go ahead. Sorry.\n\nThe warning is basically saying, \u201cWe expect you to hold yourselves to a higher standard. You\u2019re trending in the wrong direction.\u201d\n\nRight, or ... Is there an \u201cor else\u201d anywhere in there?\n\nWell, it\u2019s implied, right?\n\nRight. Okay.\n\nIf they don\u2019t get ahold of this, it\u2019s problematic for us and for that community and, I think, for our country. So that can go all the way to a ban. It could go the other way and result in the removal of the quarantine. But, in order for that to happen, we would have to see a real, concerted effort to make a change and ownership of this challenge. I haven\u2019t seen it yet.\n\nRight.\n\nSo this gets back to my point of, if they are a self-described a never-ending rally for the president and we can all see the behavior of people at those rallies and this is a digital version of that, I think they have their work cut out for them.\n\nSo when do you decide what to do? Because I remember talking to Facebook people and Twitter people around Alex Jones, and one of the things that drove me crazy ... I got in discussions with a lot of the executives there about this, and I was like, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be taking him off so you might as well do it now. That\u2019s the end result. You\u2019re going to do it, because he\u2019s broken the rules a million times.\u201d\n\nYeah.\n\nThey were like, \u201cWell, we\u2019re considering ...\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, but in the end, you\u2019re going to take him off. Three weeks, four weeks, he\u2019s coming off.\u201d\n\nYep.\n\nYou can always just see, in the distance, where it\u2019s going, and it was fascinating because they weren\u2019t particularly resistant. It just was this sort of slow roll to the inevitable. How do you think of a quarantine, versus a ban? You expect them to do what? What can they ...\n\nAt Facebook, what they did, which I thought was really interesting, it\u2019s like, \u201cWell we have a bunch of strikes on them,\u201d and I was like, \u201cWell, how many strikes?\u201d \u201cWell, we can\u2019t say, because if they know they\u2019ll game it up until the blank strike.\u201d I was like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s ridiculous. Why don\u2019t you just say you have three strikes and then we\u2019re going to take you out,\u201d or whatever? It turned out to be nine, and that was like the greatest ... It was nine at Facebook, and it was the biggest secret, \u201cOh, don\u2019t tell them nine, because they\u2019ll know,\u201d and I was like ... I didn\u2019t even understand the mentality of that.\n\nI mean, I can understand it a little bit.\n\nI don\u2019t know why it was nine, but go ahead.\n\nI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s nine either, but I\u2019m sure they have a reason. Look, they have their reasons. I can say, in our own policies, I had this idea when I came back to Reddit in 2015, watching all this stuff, and I was like, you know what? Reddit needs crystal-clear policies. Draw a line and enforce it really aggressively.\n\nEnforcement is critical, of course.\n\nThe challenge is, wherever we would draw that line, the users would go right up to it and stick their nose over it and just waste our time. So, actually, our policies are deliberately ... They leave a little wiggle room. I think that room for interpretation is important because we have to adapt with the changing situation.\n\nSo, communities that get banned on Reddit are the ones where they\u2019re in consistent violation of our policies, the moderators are not cooperative, and there\u2019s just no way they\u2019re going to recover. What we\u2019re talking about with The_Donald is a community dedicated to the president, and so I do think we have to acknowledge that the era in which we live, we live in an era where two reasonable people can have a spirited debate about whether or not the president of the United States should be allowed to tweet.\n\nThat debate\u2019s over, but go ahead.\n\nThe fact that that\u2019s a question is absurd. So, political speech is amongst the most sacred in our country, and we do believe that, and removing a community that represents political views of a large percentage of our population I think is deeply problematic. But at the same time, it doesn\u2019t mean a community can use that as a shield to behave dangerously.\n\nSo, you\u2019re talking about The_Donald moving in the wrong direction, and of course, we saw the physical manifestation of that at the rally, the \u201csend her back\u201d chanting, which I think is sticking their nose over the ... That\u2019s a version of that, because it\u2019s not quite violent, but it\u2019s not quite not. You know what I mean?\n\nYes.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of in that sort of weird space that\u2019s offensive and yet not necessarily dangerous, but is, really. When do you decide whether they\u2019ve gotten better, and what is better? Why not ban? Why not just ... Are they not going to get better, or just you can\u2019t do that yet?\n\nI think you\u2019re asking really good questions, and these are questions we are asking ourselves. If I thought, similar to what you were talking about with Alex Jones before, if I thought the answer, if I thought it was inevitable, we would just do it, because as the CEO, I don\u2019t want to waste time on something that\u2019s inevitable, and we have made decisions like that in the past. Right? There\u2019s just no hope here. We don\u2019t have the perfect words, but we\u2019re not going to spend any more time on this.\n\nI have in mind of a series of things they could do that would be steps in the right direction. One of them, without going into specifics, one of the things I would like to see is ownership of, \u201cWe are going to support the president, but we are not going to have anything remotely violent on this community, and we are going to enforce that ruthlessly.\u201d\n\nIf I saw that message, and then I saw them do that in the data, that would be a compelling argument. Instead, we saw a YouTube video stickied on the top that was the equivalent of \u201csend her back,\u201d and so I saw that, and me and our policy lead Jessica were like, \u201cWell, doesn\u2019t look like they want to be un-quarantined next week.\u201d So, we\u2019ll see.\n\nYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s not in violation of our content policy. It\u2019s gross, and you can play that forward and see how that\u2019s problematic, but I can also play forward how forbidding that sort of language, even though it\u2019s deeply in contrast to my own personal values, is also problematic.\n\nSo, getting to the idea of your responsibility to do something about it, given you create ... I know you\u2019re a much more user-generated \u2026 It\u2019s such a different experience. You\u2019re sort of past Twitter. Twitter\u2019s closer to Facebook, but they\u2019re sort of in the middle. It\u2019s kind of a free-for-all there, too, very much less organized and no moderators whatsoever, which changes the equation quite a bit.\n\nVery much.\n\nI want you to talk to the bigger ethos in Silicon Valley, because I\u2019ve still not understood it correctly. Why not take responsibility for the content on your platform? I just was thinking, when we were ... On Recode, or All Things D, we had a lot of comments on our site, and a lot of them are just vile and just not conducive to community, just a pain in the ass. They were just a lot of crazy people. When Steve Jobs died, there was all these ... \u201cHe had AIDS,\u201d and then there was a whole anti-gay thing. It went on and on, and we have a very small staff, and we didn\u2019t want to moderate, and we were sick of it.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the status of those comments now?\n\nI got rid of all of them. I just made the decision, no more comments. You can go to Twitter if you want to yell at me. Sounds good. What was really interesting is I got a series of emails from a couple of them, because one guy kept coming back and being vile all over the place and kept changing his ... All kinds of tricks. It was exhausting to try to chase this guy, but he wasn\u2019t too smart, so we could always figure out it was him once again, so it was kind of you\u2019re dumb and yet persistent.\n\nTotally.\n\nYou know what I mean?\n\nOh, I know what you mean.\n\nIt was really interesting, the kind of energy he put into fucking with us.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat was really interesting is he kept writing me these emails, and he got me on Twitter, like, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that. I have a right to say what I want,\u201d and I said, \u201cNot on my fucking website. Go over to Twitter.\u201d You know what I mean?\n\nYes.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s my website. I say no,\u201d and he goes, \u201cYou can\u2019t say no.\u201d He goes, \u201cIt\u2019s a free country. It\u2019s free speech.\u201d I go, \u201cCongress shall ...\u201d I have this obsession with the First Amendment. I\u2019m like, \u201cCongress shall make no law... Kara Swisher can make whatever frigging laws she wants, and she\u2019s going to say, \u2018You get off of my site.\u2019\u201d So, it was a really interesting debate at the time. This was years and years ago, but I remember sort of the mentality of being able to say and do whatever you want, and then I thought, \u201cI\u2019ll just take responsibility for it,\u201d and eventually, that\u2019s where all our comments happen. There\u2019s an overwhelming feeling here of not doing that, and I get part of it, but other parts I\u2019m like, you just don\u2019t want to face the music of that.\n\nWell, if we were to do what you did and get rid of comments, Reddit\u2019s gone.\n\nWell, yes. Of course. Yes, I got that. I got that.\n\nNo, but that\u2019s the point.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nThat\u2019s the point. That\u2019s the point, and so ...\n\nYeah. Well, I meant more stuff that\u2019s so obviously not ...\n\nWell, the stuff that\u2019s obviously bad is gone. The edge, the line for us right now is The_Donald.\n\nPolitical comment, The_Donald. Right. So, it\u2019s moved.\n\nOh, of course it\u2019s moved. Since you and I last spoke, we\u2019ve updated our policies on harassing and bullying. We\u2019ve updated our policies on violence. We\u2019ve built out a massive team. Our anti-evil team, both in the engineering and operations ...\n\nIt\u2019s called the anti-evil team?\n\nAnti-evil, yes.\n\nOkay. All right. Do you have uniforms?\n\nSecret uniforms, yes.\n\nOkay. All right. Yeah.\n\nHoodies and plaid, yes. So, we have actually, I think, on what I would perceive as vile ...\n\nYes, you\u2019ve moved.\n\nWe\u2019ve done a lot there. Now, there\u2019s always more, and whenever we ban a community, I always think, how could we have put ourselves in a position for the community to have done this for themselves? We had this joke when I was in the computer science department that brute force is the second-best solution to every problem.\n\nA little computing joking. Go ahead.\n\nSo, my fantasy is that one day the Reddit community \u2014 which really, it\u2019s not Redditors, it\u2019s people, we\u2019re pretty massive now \u2014 can do this for themselves. But in present day, we have to intervene because something does need to be done, and so we do.\n\nBut we\u2019re very different from, certainly, Facebook and even from Twitter. One of the reasons is in the downvote. So, for example, all of our content has upvotes, which is the equivalent of Twitter with the hearts or \u201cLikes\u201d or retweets or whatever they are, the positive affirmations you see on the internet. The downvote is really important because ...\n\nThey don\u2019t have a \u201cdon\u2019t like,\u201d but go ahead.\n\nThey don\u2019t.\n\nThey don\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s really important because I think that\u2019s where culture is defined. That\u2019s where people say, \u201cThis behavior or these words are not allowed here. I don\u2019t care what the rules are. I as an individual say no.\u201d You can see the effect of this. You go on Twitter, everything Donald Trump tweets, he gets 50 to 80,000 hearts or whatever. He thinks he\u2019s the most popular guy in the country, and to an extent, he is. If he did that same thing on Reddit, he might get the same 50,000 upvotes, but he\u2019d also probably get a million downvotes, and I think that\u2019d be a really clear message that what you\u2019re saying is not welcome here.\n\nWe think this is really powerful. So, when I talk about empowering people, even through something as simple as the downvote, that allows us to scale in ways that our peers can\u2019t. One of our sayings is, the only thing that scales with users is users. I\u2019ll get off my soapbox, or maybe you\u2019ll give me another opportunity to get on it.\n\nYes, I ... No.\n\nBut one of the life lessons I\u2019ve learned from Reddit is that people, when they\u2019re in the right context, will do the right thing. People are actually fundamentally good. This is my deeply held belief, and I\u2019ve learned this at Reddit, and I\u2019ve seen this.\n\nSo opposite to my point of view, but go ahead.\n\nWell, spend more time on Reddit. So, empowering our communities, empowering our moderators, letting them define the rules and the culture and express their values, I think is not only the only way that we\u2019ll survive. I think it\u2019s the only way that a user-powered platform like ours can survive in the future.\n\nOkay. So, let\u2019s talk about ... My point of view is sort of Oscar Wilde\u2019s, which was we\u2019re all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars. Not many, with the idea that we\u2019re at the bottom. Anyway, good thing I\u2019m not running Reddit.\n\nSo, when you think about that, one of the issues is right versus left. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in Washington recently, and I\u2019m engaging with a lot of the people on the right to talk about whether they\u2019re being shadow banned, whatever their conspiracy theory of the moment is, and it is. It\u2019s just not happening that way. They tend to violate more, from what I can figure out.\n\nThe_Donald bans more users than just about any other community on Reddit.\n\nRight, right, because there\u2019s more violations of it. How do you answer that from the right? I want to engage. I\u2019m going to be doing a podcast with Josh Hawley, and we had a discussion before, and some of his proposals are really interesting around regulation of tech, and they\u2019re smart, and he\u2019s obviously a very smart lawyer and everything else, and then he goes off on the shadow-banning stuff in a way that is just absolutely wrong, from every bit of reporting I\u2019ve done.\n\nAnd I said, \u201cLook, if you\u2019re going to go off to Crazy Town, I\u2019m going to shut you down, real hard, so just be aware of that. I want to talk about the smart things you want to do,\u201d and from Cruz to all of them, really do truly believe this. Scaramucci, all of them believe it, and Donald Trump obviously says it all the time. How do you respond to that right versus left, that you\u2019re favoring ... Trump just did it this week, is we\u2019re not insulting the Squad, we\u2019re insulting his racist remarks and not their racist remarks.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s an absurd claim. It\u2019s an absurd claim. How could you possibly make the claim that the right is being silenced in this country where Donald Trump is president and they control the Senate and they controlled the House for years?\n\nYes, I know. It\u2019s sore losers. Sore winners, I call them. Sorry.\n\nCorrect. One experience I\u2019ve had, though, talking with politicians on both the right and the left, is actually this message of, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be the arbiter of truth. That is the job of journalists. That is the job of people, of society, and we are going to orient our platform around that idea,\u201d actually resonates really well with both sides, because I think it\u2019s fundamentally an American idea, and it\u2019s one of our earliest ideas. So, I do believe there is rational thinking on both sides around this issue, but I also sense from both of them a lot of fear. Right?\n\nWhat are we gonna do about this, whether they\u2019re talking about how do we fight hate online or how do we fight the fact that my political views seem to be not welcome or ostracized or this or that? What do we do about this? But if the answer is, well, you don\u2019t get to choose politicians, and a private company is problematic as well, but there is another path, that actually resonates with them. So, I have some optimism there. Now, maybe they\u2019re just humoring me, and \u201cSteve, get out of my office,\u201d sort of thing, but I do think there is a path forward.\n\nWhat would that be? Because today, you saw the story that the Justice Department is looking into antitrust violations. They didn\u2019t name companies, but they said in search services, in retail, in social media, large companies we\u2019re not going to name.\n\nOh, shit, they\u2019re coming after us!\n\nNo, they\u2019re not coming after you. Facebook, Google, Amazon, essentially. There\u2019s movement afoot in antitrust. There\u2019s regulatory things. Are you fearful, or what would you like to see from a regulatory scheme work? Because it\u2019s coming.\n\nWould I love to see the government F our largest competitors?\n\nYes, yes. You would.\n\nYeah! That\u2019d be great. That\u2019d be amazing.\n\nOkay. That\u2019s the best answer I\u2019ve gotten for a long time.\n\nLook, it\u2019s a conversation worth having.\n\nThey\u2019re going to F your largest competitors, but go ahead.\n\nHonestly, I hope they do it for the right reasons. The right reasons would be what is best for business in the US, what ensures a reasonably level playing field, and not out of spite, like, you screwed up over here and we\u2019re coming after you over here.\n\nAll right. So, what is the problem that they need to solve of these big companies, from your perspective? Then we\u2019ll get questions from the audience, because we\u2019ve got about an hour, I think. Manny? Where\u2019s Manny? In a minute, we\u2019ll start with ...\n\nI mean, presumably they\u2019re going to look into whether these companies have an unfair advantage. I think I could make an argument on both sides, very easily. One, Google and Facebook control 80 percent of the ad spend in the US, so I\u2019d say that\u2019s a pretty massive advantage. On the other hand, there are benefits that come out of when companies get really big.\n\nThe example of that I like to screw with myself with is when I think about Bell. Right? Bell is a very famous monopoly that was ultimately broken up, but a company that big and with those resources created Bell Labs, which created the laser, the cellphone, TCP, which is the internet, satellites, I believe. So, what I don\u2019t buy is the argument that the solution to our content moderation challenges is because we\u2019re so big. Only a big company like us ...\n\nThat\u2019s their new excuse.\n\nYeah, I don\u2019t buy that for a second.\n\nNo, neither do I.\n\nBecause we are a tiny company compared to them. We\u2019re growing. We\u2019re about 500 people now, but we were half the size a year ago, and half that size the year before. I think where they are running away from the problem, we\u2019re running towards it, because I actually think we can solve it. I think we can present a solution, at least, that scales. So, I don\u2019t buy this we\u2019re too big to fail, or you have to be big to do this sort of stuff argument.\n\nYou have to be big to fight this, and you have to big to fight China. They\u2019ve got a whole bunch in that you-have-to-be-big argument area.\n\nSo, what would you see \u2014 and then let\u2019s get questions from the audience \u2014 what would you see as fixing the content moderation issue? Because it\u2019s not just ... It\u2019s content moderation, which is married to hate speech, which is married to people feeling depressed, it\u2019s creating mental issues around our society, which is linked to addiction, which is linked to election ... It\u2019s all part of a larger spin.\n\nYeah. So, if we\u2019re going to talk about what should we do, I said it many times today, which is empower our users, empower our communities. For example, our communities, Reddit doesn\u2019t have a formal hate speech policy. We have the violent speech policy, but the majority of our top communities have a hate speech policy. They all draw the line in slightly different places, because it\u2019s a difficult thing to define, and they all enforce it with different levels of strictness, but we think that\u2019s a very powerful thing. I think that\u2019s very encouraging.\n\nThey make their own rules.\n\nThey make their own rules and they enforce them, and those rules reflect their values, and I think the values of people are generally pointed in the right direction, if we take advantage of that. Now, if we\u2019re talking about, when we talk about what\u2019s going on in the country, I think we face some real challenges.\n\nOne of the things that I find personally a little dismaying is in all of our talk about politics and tech and the next election and what do we do, we don\u2019t spend enough time talking about the fact that the suicide rate is skyrocketing, and the opioid crisis, and all of the ways that I think we as a society have neglected ourselves. The middle class is completely decimated. So, it\u2019s no surprise to me that people want to turn away from the establishment politics and turn away from our government and just find somebody different to do something differently. I think we can spend more time looking at ourselves, not just as tech companies, but as Americans, and trying to figure out, how can we make things better for everybody?\n\nDo you blame tech for these issues now? I saw a movie last night, The Great Hack, which is coming to Netflix on Wednesday, I think. It\u2019s about Brexit. It\u2019s about the Trump election. It\u2019s really probably the most depressing documentary I\u2019ve seen in a long time.\n\nI look at Reddit specifically as a reflection of what\u2019s going on in the country. So, two, three years ago, The_Donald was our No. 2 community. Now it\u2019s not in our top 250, and so to me, that\u2019s a reflection of what\u2019s going on in the country. Whether or not Reddit existed, I think the cause of that symptom would still exist, which is America is not working for the majority of Americans, and so they\u2019re looking for something else. I think we went the wrong way and we\u2019re seeing that now, quite viscerally. We\u2019re not trending in the right direction. But no, I don\u2019t think it was tech that caused that, but I do think it\u2019s tech that reveals that and amplifies some of these views, for sure.\n\nOkay. We\u2019re going to do questions. What is the top community right now, the top two communities on Reddit?\n\nThe top two communities, I believe, are AskReddit and IAmA.\n\nThis is the Ask Me Anything.\n\nYes. Yeah, so our blue chips. They\u2019ve been No. 1 and 2 for a long time.\n\nWhat is the top one that\u2019s not one of ... I\u2019m just curious, what\u2019s the trend?\n\nThat\u2019s actually a great question. I don\u2019t know off the top of my head. AskReddit, IAmA, news, politics, gaming is very big. Those are our biggest categories. I\u2019ll call them kind of Reddit, human interest, gaming, news and politics, and then entertainment.\n\nSo in topic ... There\u2019s not something particularly ...\n\nThere is, I just don\u2019t know it off the top of my head.\n\nAll right. Questions from the audience?\n\nEric: Hi, my name\u2019s Eric. I\u2019m the communications director for Agatha Bacelar. She\u2019s actually running for Congress here in San Francisco against Nancy Pelosi. My question is, Pew recently did a survey of the people that use Reddit and they found that it\u2019s 72 percent male and I\u2019m just kind of curious to hear your explanation for that and your thoughts on if it has anything to do with the downvote mechanic that you mentioned earlier.\n\nSteve Huffman: That\u2019s a great question. We don\u2019t know that number because we don\u2019t ask our users their gender, but I will say that number is reasonably aligned with what we kind of figure out by looking at our own data. I actually find that number encouraging because when we started Reddit we were probably 99 percent male. So we\u2019re actually trending in the right direction towards a more balanced user base.\n\nBut [when] we started, Reddit had one community and our product strategy in that era in 2005 was, \u201cI\u2019m going to build things that I like.\u201d And my reasoning for doing so was I am not unique. There are millions of people just like me, and so if I build things that I like, millions of people will like it. That turned out to be a decent strategy. It also turned out that there are millions of people just like me, but there are not hundreds of millions of people just like me or billions of people just like me. But we started with one community and the news was programming, tech, gaming, internet memes. Categories that are dominated by men. And certainly, 15 years ago, even more so.\n\nAs Reddit\u2019s grown \u2014 we celebrated our 14th birthday about a month ago \u2014 we have diversified tremendously. And so, we\u2019re moving in the right direction. So our categories right now cover ... our largest categories are still gaming, which is very male-dominated; news and politics on Reddit as a category that should be more balanced but I think it still skews male, both out of history and also I think kind of the tone of some of those conversations can be off-putting. But we also see communities right now growing around fashion and parenting and hobbies that are of interests predominantly of women. And so I can see the seeds of that growing.\n\nOne of our major initiatives right now across the company is safety. And so making Reddit ... Making sure that people have good experiences on Reddit. That they\u2019re free from harassment and bullying, which women face more of online. So I\u2019m not surprised at that number. And I think the story arc over the years makes sense. But it is really important to us, both ... Well for a variety of reasons, to balance that out.\n\nI think most importantly, diversity, whether we\u2019re talking about in nature or on our platform or in our workforce, diversity equals resilience. And learning how to grow in new categories with new populations is a requirement for us to be able to grow internationally. And our mission is to bring community and belonging to everybody in the world. That\u2019s really what Reddit\u2019s product is. And so to bring that to everybody in the world, we have to have everybody in the world on our platform. So that means Reddit has to work for everybody, not just dudes, not just Americans, but everybody. So we\u2019ve got a long way to go, but I think we\u2019re getting there.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s do one back here.\n\nJosh: Hi, I\u2019m Josh. I\u2019d just be interested to understand your view of how Facebook moderates and they remunerated the moderators, whereas your moderation is largely community and volunteer driven and how some of them, I believe in We Are The Nerds, experienced similar difficulties as to what Casey [Newton] found.\n\nSteve Huffman: I missed the last ...\n\nJosh: In a book that I read, some of the moderation experience of harassment and violent imagery were experienced by your volunteer moderators, whereas the paid moderators of Facebook are going through similar things.\n\nSteve Huffman: Yeah, so our moderators are users. And they\u2019re users who create our communities and they write the rules and they\u2019re volunteers. And that\u2019s the way Reddit\u2019s worked since the beginning. Our relationship with them is evolving. Right now, we have many thousands of moderators that moderate many thousands of communities. One of our larger teams is basically dedicated to moderators and building mod tools. So there\u2019s both build mod tools and then also work towards the safety of our moderators because we do know they\u2019re on the receiving end of harassment, more so than the average user, and that is problematic and that\u2019s not something we want to see into the future.\n\nAnd as I\u2019ve said many times today, the key to us being able to scale and to achieve our mission is to empower our communities. And in many ways that means empower our moderators and making sure they\u2019re having good experiences. So I think as with all things, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress here. We\u2019ve been chasing down harassment and bullying site-wide and have actually made pretty great strides over the last couple of years from being 100 percent reactive three years ago to being about 98 or so percent proactive today. So we\u2019re finding a lot more and getting rid of it before it even affects users and, in particular, moderators. But, that said, it is ...\n\nFinding it via how?\n\nWe\u2019ll look at patterns of reports. So it\u2019s usually a small number of users creating a lot of the problems. So if they create problems over here and get reported, then we\u2019ll go through and action that user, right? Or we\u2019ll look for ... basically patterns in PMs and we can see this behavior. We do have a fair amount of machine learning in there and trying to figure out what\u2019s abuse and what\u2019s not. And so we\u2019re learning as we grow. But we\u2019ve gotten much more effective at that. Long story short is we\u2019ve made progress there.\n\nJosh: \u2026 compensation.\n\nSteve Huffman: Compensation, well, that\u2019s very different from harassment. So the way we think about that is there\u2019s ... A few steps down the road what I would like to do is when I say empower communities, I think there\u2019s an extreme version of that, which is where we bring economics into this. Allowing communities to have business models. And hopefully you can use your imagination there, but I think there\u2019s a lot they can do and that would open the door to communities having money and potentially moderators having a share of that. So I think we\u2019re pretty far off, but that\u2019s one of my, kind of, fantasies, that we can elevate communities to such a degree that people can actually run a business or earn a living on Reddit.\n\nOkay. Another question right here.\n\nAudience member: You said that you look at Reddit as either a tech company or as a news company. I think that Reddit is slowly evolving into a canon for a company for machine learning and NLP [natural language processing] systems, like the state-of-the-art generative model that OpenAI basically trained was trained using a dataset that was seeded off of Reddit. So what Reddit is basically doing is curating anthropocentric human-created data for all of your ... The bots to basically train off of. So do you have any policies in place where you have a set of rules for what can be passed from your site and what cannot be? And because it\u2019s very easy to kind of curate data sets off of \u2014 and basically build metadata assets off of \u2014 Reddit and basically train these large machine learning models that can be used as generative models for both propaganda or for hate speech.\n\nSteve Huffman: Yeah. So it sounds like what you\u2019re saying is we shouldn\u2019t allow people to scrape Reddit because they can train AI models that can be used for bad things. Reddit is a public platform, right? We cannot control ... Reddit wouldn\u2019t exist if we didn\u2019t make everything public. And so Reddit, yes, is probably one of the largest repositories online of human speech, and that can be used for really wonderful things and it can be used to create bots that do bad things. But that ... I think the ethical dilemma there is using bots to do bad things. It\u2019s not in making speech or humanity publicly available.\n\nSo I think it\u2019s actually really important that we allow Reddit to stay public. Because when I talk about community and belonging, being able to see what\u2019s going on in the world and get to see what people think about things all over the world and around any topic is critically important. So yes, we do try to limit people actually scraping us, but there\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to practically prevent the development of AI, nor do I think that\u2019s even a good idea.\n\nEven if it\u2019s ... Because it typically is used for bad purposes is your point. It\u2019s typically used ... It\u2019s not used for helping humanity, it\u2019s used to either help the Russians or sell Pampers or whatever the hell they want to do with it.\n\nThat is an absurd claim.\n\nOkay, all right. That\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just ...\n\nThat AI is used only for bad things is ...\n\nNo. No, of course not. But the examples have, of late, been not positive.\n\nWell, those are sexy examples, right? Those are sexy examples and ...\n\nRight. Well they\u2019re not sexy, just depressing.\n\nWell, they\u2019re ... Look, they\u2019re going to generate clicks for whoever\u2019s writing about it.\n\nRight. You know what, let\u2019s put a rest to that. Journalists ... I do not sit around going, \u201cOh, this will be click-y.\u201d No journalist I\u2019ve ever met has ever done that, except for maybe Rupert Murdoch\u2019s people.\n\nKara, I believe that, but a lot of people writing things online who aren\u2019t journalists ...\n\nYes, that\u2019s true. But that\u2019s different. That\u2019s like ... There\u2019s a lot ... Anyway. Sorry.\n\nLong story short, look, AI is inevitable. We are going to fight, we\u2019re gonna face ethical dilemmas with these in the same way that the technology that powers cars also powers tanks, right? These are human problems and technology moves humanity forward. And I generally believe that\u2019s overwhelmingly good.\n\nI mean, look at the state of the world. I know it\u2019s easy to get pessimistic, but the status quo for humanity is substantially higher now than it was 100 years ago. And I hope that it\u2019ll be substantially higher 100 years from now. And so what\u2019s important is that we hold ourselves to ethical standards as people and not eliminate technology just because it has a bad use.\n\nRight. Well, I think it\u2019s easy to get into that, though. I mean, you can talk about lots of things that AI are going to do, but if you look at any of the technologies, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the realm to realize something like Twitter, I won\u2019t do Reddit, for example, it looks like it\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s show pony. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s been used in that way.\n\nAnd even though there\u2019s tons of great things going on on Twitter \u2014 there\u2019s funny things, there\u2019s wonderful things \u2014 most of the examples now is this is governing and you saw that in the racist tweets just this week, but you see governing by it, you see campaigning, you see propaganda by it. So it\u2019s not ... We\u2019re not looking at the negative, it\u2019s just the overwhelmingly strongest case for it is that.\n\nYeah, I hear you on that point. And I do think as a tech company, Reddit in particular, we do have a role to play in this, which is that the volume of any particular viewpoint on Reddit, good or bad, is in proportion to the number of people who actually have it. That Reddit, to the extent that I believe it is and should be a reflection of what\u2019s going on in society, it should be an accurate reflection of what\u2019s going on in society and that means our systems aren\u2019t being gamed. We\u2019re not being manipulated by bots or, more commonly, Americans with a political agenda. That we\u2019re presenting a fair and accurate view of the world. And so as a tech company, that\u2019s where I think we have the most control and I think when we do a good job at that, that\u2019s when we see wonderful things occur. When we were not doing a good job at that, that\u2019s when we saw the bad behavior take over.\n\nBut if you go to Reddit today, the vast majority of our content is this really interesting view, this glimpse into humanity that we wouldn\u2019t otherwise see. And I would love to train AI models on the best of humanity and ... But we also, I fully admit, we will hold ourselves to as high a standard as possible towards that end.\n\nAll right. Manny, do we have time for one more question or not?\n\nManny Yekutiel: We have time for one more question.\n\nOne more question. Oh, I\u2019d like to get you right there.\n\nManny Yekutiel: Okay.\n\nTo get a lady.\n\nManny Yekutiel: By the way, I didn\u2019t understand any of the terminology that he used.\n\n\u201cAI bad.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d \u201cYes, it is.\u201d\n\nManny Yekutiel: Nothing. I didn\u2019t understand anything.\n\nSteve Huffman: AI is like the two words that either are like world peace or the end of days. The reality is somewhere in the middle.\n\nJust the fact that it so could be the end of days is why people are nervous about it, that\u2019s why.\n\nCleo Kirkland: Hi, I\u2019m Cleo Kirkland.\n\nSteve Huffman: Hey, Cleo.\n\nCleo Kirkland: I used to work with Steve at Hipmunk.\n\nSteve Huffman: Good to see you.\n\nCleo Kirkland: When he was slinging airline tickets.\n\nSteve Huffman: We were doing it together. Good to see you.\n\nCleo Kirkland: So what has surprised you, good or bad, from in the last year from your competitors, Facebook, Twitter, in terms of what they\u2019ve allowed to go on their platform. And same question for the Reddit community, positive or negative, surprises?\n\nThat\u2019s a good question to end on.\n\nWell, let me start with the Reddit version. Because this is the one I know the best. There\u2019s actually this paper, I referenced it a little while ago without giving credit. There was a paper that came out of Georgia Tech, I forget the title and I should really know this, but it\u2019s something about the community norms online. But what they did is they studied Reddit, because it\u2019s publicly available, and looked at all of the community rules and the content that was removed and they found that the vast majority of our communities removed, for example, hate speech.\n\nAnd this was really encouraging to me, because this is something we\u2019ve been wrestling with, which is how do we do this? How do we scale this into the future? And so seeing academics find this in Reddit and actually help us understand how and why Reddit works is really important to us. Because sometimes I think our job is less as product people and more as sociologists studying this thing that continues to grow and continues to do really cool things.\n\nWe often wonder why does this \u2014 this company was not well run for a long time. Why do we deserve to exist? And I think we deserve to exist because we reveal, I think, the best of people. And so seeing that validated by third parties was really cool.\n\nAs for our competitors, look, they are, I think, wrestling with real challenges, and these challenges I don\u2019t think were \u2014 or sticky situations \u2014 were not created intentionally or overnight, unfortunately, which means they can\u2019t be undone overnight. And so there\u2019s a process that I think they and we all have to go through, which is figure out, hey, now we have these real problems, how can we solve them? And how can we solve them without undermining the value that these businesses actually provide people?\n\nOr maybe someone was ... I was on a panel last night, maybe these businesses aren\u2019t worth what they\u2019re worth. Maybe they\u2019re worth a quarter of what they\u2019re ... If they have to do the things necessary and spend the money necessary to do the things to clean them up, perhaps their business model isn\u2019t so good, perhaps...\n\nWell, I can only speak for our business model. And as I said before, the only thing that scales with users is users. I think if you\u2019re ... If we were to try to throw money and employees at it, that is a losing strategy.\n\nOkay. Very last question: is The_Donald gonna make it?\n\nIf The_Donald is a digital version of a Donald Trump rally, I\u2019m not holding my breath. Wait, I\u2019m holding ... I\u2019m not holding my breath.\n\nOkay. You\u2019re not holding your breath, because then you die. Right?\n\nYes.\n\nOkay. All right, everybody, Steve Huffman of Reddit. Thank you.\n\nThank you all.\n\nRecode and Vox have joined forces to uncover and explain how our digital world is changing \u2014 and changing us.
