This is a big help for us to have one kilo of rice for the day,\u201d Veronica Dolorico, a 49-year-old supporter of the programme, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cI feel that our surroundings are really dirty. If only I could, I would pick up all the plastics along the road when I walk outside,\u201d she added.\n\nOne kg of rice costs about 30-40 pesos ($0.70), which is costly in a country with a fast-growing economy, but high rates of urban and rural poverty.\n\nOne-fifth of the population of 107 million people live below the national poverty line, with monthly consumption of less than $241 per person.\n\nBayanan collected more than 213 kg of sachets, bottles and plastic bags in August, said village chief Andor San Pedro, adding the food-for-trash swap is teaching people how to properly dispose of their waste.", "description": "A village in the Philippines is trying to tackle the scourge of plastic waste by offering rice to residents in exchange for their trash.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
