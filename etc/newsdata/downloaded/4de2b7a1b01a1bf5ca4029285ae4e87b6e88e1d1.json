Offenses Won.", "language": "en", "text": "Last year, the Cleveland Browns did something peculiarly archaic. For a series of plays during a win against Atlanta, Baker Mayfield lined up flanked by three running backs in the wishbone, a formation that\u2019s more than a half-century old and obsolete at the highest levels of football.\n\nBut inside this anachronism was a window into the present and future of football: the war for space on the field. And more than ever, NFL offenses are winning that battle.\n\nFootball coaches distill the goal of every scheme down to the idea of space. The most fundamental goal for every offensive play is to create it\u2014space is where wide receivers get open and playmakers thrive. The objective for every defense is to constrict that same space.\n\nBut the space is finite because of a simple geometric fact. Football fields are 120 yards long and 53\u2153 yards wide. That\u2019s 57,600 square feet for players to operate in, yet for most of professional football history, offenses have struggled to maximize all of it. They packed formations tightly and limited themselves to narrow lanes down the field. They were architects given a sprawling plot of land who confined themselves to small parcels of it.\n\nThe realization that there was more space to exploit has spurred an offensive boom in the NFL. Offenses averaged more points per possession and yards per play in 2018 than ever. They are challenging defenses to cover the entire football field like never before.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the offenses are so much better now,\u201d said Hall of Fame quarterback and Broncos general manager John Elway. \u201cStretch the field\u2014but also do it horizontally.\u201d\n\nThis awakening is on full display as this season begins. It\u2019s behind how Sean McVay revitalized the Rams and why Patrick Mahomes exploded under Andy Reid in Kansas City. The best talents in the league are finally being given the room they need to succeed.\n\nBut it would\u2019ve never happened without decades of tinkering that led to this point. Fifty years ago, college football was upended by an idea that began this way of thinking. It was a formation called the wishbone. Texas used it to win 30 consecutive games, and other powerhouses like Alabama and Oklahoma soon followed en route to national championships of their own.\n\nOklahoma quarterback Jamelle Holieway dazzled the college football world as a true freshman who mastered Oklahoma\u2019s dynamic wishbone attack and led the Sooners to the 1985 national championship.

Passing was a rarity. But this antiquated offense was also futuristic: it took advantage of the vast width of a football field. Running was no longer limited to a singular direction. Defenders had to make a choice between going after the guy with the ball, or the one who would later receive it.\n\nBut the wishbone shunted another dimension. Because passing was such an afterthought, wishbone teams didn\u2019t push the ball vertically. When Texas went undefeated in 1969, the Longhorns ran for 3,630 yards and passed for only 1,091.\n\n\u201cThe best offenses use the width\u2014and the depth of the field,\u201d McVay says.\n\nOther scheming minds looked for an edge by revolutionizing the passing game. The \u201cWest Coast Offense,\u201d which Bill Walsh used to win three Super Bowls with the San Francisco 49ers, attacked the edges of the field with a preponderance of higher percentage, shorter-length passes. Observers likened it to reconstructing the running game into a passing attack.\n\nOther twists opened up the vertical element. In 1980, the Chargers broke the NFL record for most passing yards in a season, and by 1985 they had five of the six most prolific passing years ever. They did it with a self-explanatory offense called \u201cAir Coryell.\u201d Their coach, Don Coryell, wanted to air the ball as far down field as frequently as possible.\n\nStill, there was a lingering question: how could an offense attack defenses in every direction on every play? The solution was hiding in plain sight\u2014in college football. It just took shockingly long to trickle up to the pros.\n\nIn 2000, the same season the Ravens won the Super Bowl with one of the best defenses in NFL history, something far more important happened: Northwestern won a bunch of football games. The Wildcats didn\u2019t invent the spread offense, but when a bunch of eggheads started using it to topple powerhouses, the whole football world had to pay attention. They beat No. 7 Wisconsin, thumped No. 18 Michigan State and then toppled No. 12 Michigan 54-51 in a nationally televised thriller.\n\n\u201cI saw them almost scoring at will,\u201d Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said afterward.\n\nVariations of the spread proliferated across college football. Teams lined up wide on every play with four or five receivers. They played almost exclusively out of the shotgun. The most radical teams adopted an extreme version known as the \u201cAir Raid,\u201d which played at hyperspeed and eschewed the idea of striking a balance between running plays and passing plays.\n\nFor defenses, this became a nightmare. When Baker Mayfield and Patrick Mahomes squared off in college, the final score looked like it belonged in a basketball arena: Oklahoma 66, Texas Tech 59. Offenses\u2014even the linemen\u2014were fanning out as wide as possible but constantly throwing the ball downfield.\n\nOther innovations pushed that even further. The run-pass option took the premise of the triple-option and replaced the pitch with its evolved counterpart: the pass. Jet sweeps transformed wide receivers into road runners who could take handoffs streaking across the field.\n\n\u201cTeams are continuing to trend that way and find ways to get guys the ball in space,\u201d said Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury.\n\nCardinals head coach Kliff Kingsbury looks at his play card.

He\u2019s now the coach of the Arizona Cardinals, and just a few years ago that would\u2019ve been laughable because he played in the Air Raid at Texas Tech and then coached it at his alma mater. The Air Raid was long considered heresy in the NFL because it challenged established norms so bluntly that coaches concluded it would never work in the pros.\n\nNFL teams slowly opened their minds to these ideas coaches like Kingsbury espoused. In 2001, NFL teams used the shotgun on just 14% of plays, according to Football Outsiders. In 2006, it was still just 20%. By last season, that had skyrocketed to 64%.\n\nThe savviest offenses embraced schemes that could trace their lineage through all of this and were premised on a full-fledged assault of the entire football field. The Chiefs lined up in the shotgun on 81% of snaps last year. The Rams used at least three wide receivers a whopping 93% of the time. The Patriots played faster than any team in the league.\n\nThe college game had come to the pros. The full space of the field was being utilized. NFL offenses became better than ever.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What are your predictions for the NFL season?
