Trubisky and the Bears used a no-huddle, hurry-up tempo to snap out of their offensive funk and score 28 first-half points on the way to beating Washington 31-15 on Monday night. After no passing touchdowns in the first two games of the season, Trubisky connected with Taylor Gabriel on three of them in the second quarter alone.\n\nThe 2017 second overall pick looked at ease with a fast-paced approach and picked apart Washington\u2019s porous defense on 25 of 31 passing for 231 yards. It was the offensive explosion Trubisky predicted would happen this week.\n\nThe Giants were pilloried for picking Daniel Jones. Guess what happened next... Read more\n\n\u201cIt just felt like the tempo helped us out a little bit,\u201d Trubisky said. \u201cIf everyone just continues to stick together and execute our plays and believe and just go out there and make plays, it\u2019ll be a fun offense.\u201d\n\nChicago (2-1) had just a one-yard touchdown run to show for their first two games, and Trubisky entered the night with a completion percentage of 58.3% and ranked near the bottom of the league in yards per attempt. Facing Washington brought out the best in Trubisky.\n\n\u201cHat\u2019s off to him,\u201d said Washington linebacker Cole Holcomb, who was roommates with Trubisky at North Carolina. \u201cI always knew he was a good quarterback. He struggled a little bit, but he came out and he played a good game.\u201d\n\nThe Bears took advantage of five turnovers by Washington quarterback Case Keenum: two interceptions by Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, including a pick six, another by Kyle Fuller and fumbles forced by Khalil Mack and Danny Trevathan.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all me,\u201d said Keenum, who was 30 of 43 for 331 yards and two touchdowns that didn\u2019t compensate for the turnovers. \u201cTurn it over that many times as a quarterback, I let my team down. It\u2019s all on me. I take complete responsibility. I have to take care of the ball better.\u201d", "description": "After the Chicago Bears\u2019 offense was slow to get going this season, Mitchell Trubisky was excited to speed things up", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e67674f580f1466b7505b6751ac16f115ad4b3/0_41_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f8303779e94fa9b6fa5affccabb32fb9", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
