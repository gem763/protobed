Overweight and obesity generally in year 6 has remained stable, affecting more than a third of children (34.3%).\n\nBan eating on public transport to tackle obesity, urges outgoing chief medic Read more\n\nOverweight and obesity has continued to rise among the youngest children in the report, those aged four to five, increasing from 22.4% in the previous year to 22.6% and affecting more than 135,000 children.\n\nThe figures are highest among children from the most deprived communities, where 13.3% of four- to five-year-olds are obese, compared with 5.9% in the most affluent areas. Overweight and obesity prevalence in year 6 is 26.9% in the most deprived areas, compared with 11.4% in the least deprived.\n\nPublic Health England said the figures showed the \u201cimportance of serious action from all sectors, including the government\u2019s steps to tackle childhood obesity, such as its challenge to the food industry to reduce 20% of sugar and calories in everyday foods consumed regularly by children\u201d.\n\nFood companies have so far managed less than a 5% reduction in sugar over two years. The tax on sugary drinks, however, has resulted in manufacturers cutting the sugar content by nearly 29%.\n\nChildren who are obese experience bullying and low self-esteem and are at risk of serious long-term health problems, such as type 2 diabetes, heart conditions and cancer.\n\nQ&A Why is sugar bad for you? Show Hide Eating too much sugar contributes to people having too many calories during the day, which can lead to weight gain. Being overweight increases the risk of health problems such as heart diseases, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Sugar is also one of the main causes of tooth decay. The NHS advises that most adults and children in the UK eat too much of a type of sugar called 'free sugars'. These are the sugars added to food and drinks, found in biscuits, chocolate, breakfast cereals and fizzy drinks. But they are also found naturally in honey and unsweetened fruit juices. The UK government\u2019s recommendation is that these 'free sugars' should not make up more than 5% of the calories you have every day. That is still quite a lot of sugar - it equates to seven sugar cubes worth for an adult. But bear in mind that one can of a fizzy drink can include the equivalent of 9 cubes of sugar. Children under 4 should avoid all sugar-sweetened drinks and food with added 'free sugars' in it.

It\u2019s time for the government to bring in the measures that we know will stem the tide of unhealthy food marketing and promotions, starting with the long overdue 9pm watershed on junk food adverts on TV and online.\u201d\n\nJo Churchill, the public health minister, said the government\u2019s obesity plan would help families make healthy choices. \u201cThese data highlight once again how important it is for us to tackle childhood obesity, which has a devastating impact on the health of our children. This problem has been decades in the making but we can turn this around,\u201d she said.\n\nThe figures emerged as a report sounded the alarm over the scale of obesity in countries that are part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Obesity-related diseases will claim more than 90 million lives in OECD countries in the next 30 years, with life expectancy reduced by nearly three years, it said. GDP in those countries is expected to drop by 3.3% as a result.\n\nMore than half the population is overweight in 34 out of 36 OECD countries, the report said, and almost one in four people are obese. Average rates of adult obesity in OECD countries have increased from 21% in 2010 to 24% in 2016, meaning an additional 50 million people are now obese.", "description": "Official figures show 4.4% of year 6 pupils in England need medical help for obesity", "authors": ["Sarah Boseley", "Ada Garcia"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79e53155848a76530fe0e168bdd63635aaa488c0/0_196_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6d8f7856319659713b8e030737372ab9", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
