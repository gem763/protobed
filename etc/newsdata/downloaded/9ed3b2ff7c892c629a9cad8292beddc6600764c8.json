That\u2019s reflected in some of its most stylish, desirable and collectable motorcycles ever.\n\nBrutale by name and nature, this \u201cGold Series\u201d edition brings together a multitude of exotic materials and is described as the world\u2019s most powerful naked sports bike.\n\nIf not in the mood to sample the race-bred 155kW engine spinning at a mad 13,450 revolutions per minute, you can simply park it and enjoy it as art.\n\nJust 300 are being made, worldwide; the first in Australian showrooms should appear this month at $71,990 ride-away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFashion\n\nSelected by Virginia van Heythuysen, AFR fashion director\n\nArmadillo boot by Alexander McQueen\n\nIn October 2009, the late Alexander McQueen presented his last show, \u201cAtlantis\u201d, which included the Armadillo boot. There were models who refused to walk the show after seeing them \u2013 and you can see why.\n\nYours for around $100,000 \u2013 a pair of Alexander McQueen's Armadillo stiletto boots, featuring a 30cm heel.\n\nOnly 21 pairs of these oddly grotesque boots (with a teetering 30cm heel) were ever made, and Lady Gaga snapped up three pairs of them at auction for $US290,000 in 2015.\n\nNot quite right for a nip down to the shops, they\u2019re most definitely works of art.\n\nHerm\u00e8s scarf by Kermit Oliver\n\nRetired postal worker and full-time artist Kermit Oliver is the only American artist to have designed scarves for storied French maison Herm\u00e8s. Now 76, Oliver, who lives in Waco, Texas, has created 17 designs for the house and his intricate pieces can take up to a year to develop.\n\nA Faune et Flore du Texas scarf by Herm\u00e8s is a relative steal at about $3400.\n\nHe paints each on a 90cm x 90cm square of paper and sends them to Paris to be fashioned into scarves. This example, Faune et Flore du Texas, was first made in 1987, and you can snap one up for about $US2300 ($3378).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJewellery\n\nSelected by Fiona Frith, jewellery specialist at Bonhams Sydney\n\nTorsade Diamond bangle by Suzanne Belperron\n\nOne of the most celebrated jewellery designers of the 20th century, French-born Suzanne Belperron was known for using feminine curves at a time when art deco\u2019s hard edges reigned.\n\nSuzanne Belperron's Torsade bangle last sold at auction for $294,000.\n\nUnusual materials marked Belperron as an individual in her day, while her unique designs retain a contemporary feel almost 100 years later. This bangle, made in 1932, last sold at auction for \u00a3164,500 ($294,196). It\u2019s a rare exemplar of Belperron\u2019s earliest independent work, still demonstrative of her singular style.\n\nCocktail rings by Andrew Grima\n\nAvant-garde even by today\u2019s standards, British jewellery designer Andrew Grima has historically been overlooked. But as our cringe over 1960s and \u201970s jewellery fades, we can expect a huge rise in his popularity. Grima\u2019s use of unusual materials, such as ruby zoisite crystal, cobaltoan calcite, amethyst geode and polished chalcedony druzy, made him an original.\n\nCocktail ring by Andrew Grima \u2013 a diamond pendant by this British designer fetched about $4.8 million in 2017.\n\nThere have already been some impressive sales of his jewels \u2013 a fancy-coloured diamond pendant fetched \u00a32,685,000 (about $4.8 million) in 2017. His cocktail rings and brooches will also command high prices in years to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCartier Tutti Frutti bracelet\n\nThis enamel, gem-set and diamond bracelet is familiar to many due to Cartier\u2019s blockbuster National Gallery of Australia exhibit in 2018. Cartier started experimenting with pieces inspired by Indian jewellery\u2019s rich colours and carved gemstones as early as 1901, when it made a necklace for Queen Alexandra. By the 1930s, the Tutti Frutti collection was flourishing.\n\nAn art deco Tutti Frutti bracelet by Cartier last sold for about $828,000 in 2015.\n\nThis art deco bracelet, with more than 10 carats of diamonds, is unusual in its combination of colours and the clean lines of its graphic arrangement. It last sold for \u00a3458,500 in 2015 and would make a fine investment \u2013 or piece of wrist candy.\n\nDesign\n\nSelected by Stephen Todd, AFR design editor\n\nAtmos clock by Marc Newson for Jaeger-LeCoultre\n\nSydney-born Marc Newson has designed everything from luggage to samurai swords. His Lockheed Lounge, from 1987, fetched \u00a32,434,500 on auction at Phillips, London, in April 2015 \u2013 the record for a piece of furniture by a living designer. One of Newson\u2019s favourite pieces is his Atmos clock, designed for Jaeger-LeCoultre in 2008. \u201cIt\u2019s as if it is a living thing,\u201d he says.\n\nMarc Newson's Atmos 568 clock in clear Baccarat crystal sells for $47,300.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrafted from blue Baccarat crystal with rhodium-plated feet, the Atmos 566 is available in a limited edition of 28 (POA). The 568 in clear Baccarat crystal (shown above) is available in an open edition for $47,300, and sure to become an heirloom.\n\nNacho Carbonell\u2019s sculptural furniture and lighting work, such as his Under a Light Tree seat, is being avidly collected.\n\nUnder A Light Tree seat by Nacho Carbonell\n\n\u201cI like to see objects as living organisms, imagining them coming alive and being able to surprise you with their behaviour,\u201d says Spanish designer Nacho Carbonell \u2013 behaviour like the come-hither luminosity of the Under A Light Tree love-seat.\n\nConjured from branches of gnarled brass topped with metal mesh that floats like glowing foliage, it entices sitters as moths to its flame.\n\nA graduate of the edgy Design Academy Eindhoven in the Netherlands, Carbonell\u2019s sculptural furniture and lighting work is exhibited and collected by an avid cognoscenti worldwide, and selected pieces are available through Carpenters Workshop Gallery (London, Paris, New York, San Francisco).\n\nBureau en Forme desk by Charlotte Perriand\n\nCharlotte Perriand went largely unsung until a retrospective at London\u2019s Design Museum in 1998 introduced a new generation to her work. She\u2019s now considered one of the most important designers of the 20th century.\n\nCharlotte Perriand's 1939 Bureau en Forme desk sold at auction for nearly $1.15 million in 2017.\n\nFor 10 years, Perriand worked alongside Le Corbusier and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret, devising game-changing chrome and leather furniture. In 1937, she set up her own studio, and her 1939 Bureau en Forme (Free-form desk) is a signature piece: a pinewood slab with two deep suspension drawers fronted by unpolished aluminium sheeting, on three angled legs. Artcurial sold it at auction in October 2017 for \u20ac703,400.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiapason chaise longue by Giovanni de Lucchi and Titti Saracino\n\nSome objects accrue value because of scarcity, some because of the way in which they encapsulate an era. The Diapason chaise longue does both.\n\nOriginally produced in 1973 by Elleduemila, a division of Italian manufacturer Lenzi that was operational from 1971 to 1975, only a small quantity were made and it has been out of production ever since. The way its brutal-chic concrete base cups the vicious stainless-steel blade that forms the lounger evokes a Cold War James Bond villain in his superlair. Available through Sydney rare-design importer Don Cameron.\n\nWine & Spirits\n\nSelected by Max Allen, AFR wine writer\n\nPenfolds Block 42 Cabernet Sauvignon\n\nPossibly the most precious of all Penfolds vineyards is the small patch of 130-year-old cabernet sauvignon vines on the company\u2019s Kalimna property in the Barossa Valley called Block 42. Wine made from these vines is bottled only on very rare occasions \u2013 just twice in the past 25 years \u2013 and can mature and improve in the cellar for decades, making it increasingly attractive to collectors. A bottle of the inaugural 1964 Bin 707 cabernet, made using Block 42 grapes, recently sold at auction for $13,980; the 1996 and 2004 vintages of Block 42 are a snip in comparison, selling for between $500 and $1000.\n\nFrom left: Penfolds Block 42 Cabernet Sauvignon; 2005 Champagne Jacquesson A\u00ff \u2013 Vauzelle Terme; 1993 GlenDronach Single Cask Bottling #392 Single Malt.\n\n2005 Champagne Jacquesson A\u00ff Vauzelle Terme\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, the list of top champagnes compiled by wine-searcher.com (based on the website\u2019s huge database of critics\u2019 scores) is dominated by well-established, well-known names: Krug, Cristal, Dom P\u00e9rignon, and so on. The notable exception is this rich, savoury example of the blanc de noir style from Jacquesson, established only 40 years ago. Despite tiny production \u2013 it comes from just one acre of pinot noir vines \u2013 it\u2019s one of the most attractively priced champagnes in the top-10 list. At $850 (imported by cellarhand.com.au), a magnum of this costs less than a standard bottle of half the others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1993 GlenDronach Single Cask Bottling #392 Single Malt\n\nOn February 12, 1993, barrel number 392 was just one of many casks filled with newly made whisky at the GlenDronach distillery in the Scottish Highlands. Twenty-six years later, master blender Dr Rachel Barrie has selected the contents of that barrel to be sold exclusively in Australia through The Whisky List; there are just 659 bottles available at $700 each. It is an absolutely extraordinary whisky: brooding, dark, woody aromatics, like smouldering caramel in an oak-panelled library, opening out to flavours of dried orange peel, violets, cloves, sweet heather and rich, roasted walnuts. A superb single malt.\n\nWatches\n\nSelected by Bani McSpedden, AFR watch editor\n\nWhat watch would I recommend to a budding collector? First and foremost, it\u2019s the one you\u2019d love to have on your wrist \u2013 and you\u2019d know what that is better than I would. On the other hand, if you\u2019re looking for something that will escalate in value as an investment piece, the safest bets \u2013 vintage or new \u2013 have been watches from Patek Philippe and Rolex Daytonas and Submariners, with Richard Mille more recently joining the ranks of the sought-after.\n\nHave these watches peaked? Only time will tell, but you might also consider early chronographs from Breitling, Heuer and Longines, or from brands best known to aficionados, such as Universal Gen\u00e8ve. Then there\u2019s the budget consideration, and the advice here is simple: buy the best you can afford.\n\nOriginally priced in the hundreds, a 1957 Rolex GMT-Master Reference 6542 is now valued from $120,000 to $200,000.\n\nSydney collector Andre Christian nominates the 1957 Rolex GMT-Master Reference 6542 as a Holy Grail collectable. It\u2019s the very first GMT-Master and was the result of a collaboration between the Pan Am airline and Rolex. The watch of choice for Pan Am\u2019s intercontinental pilots, it\u2019s distinguishable by a bakelite bezel and has been seen on the wrists of Fidel Castro and Picasso \u2013 and Pussy Galore in the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger. You\u2019re looking at $120,000-$200,000 for a watch that originally sold for a few hundred dollars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Universal Gen\u00e8ve Tri-Compax Reference 12552 was first released in 1944, and range from $12,000 to $80,000 in value.\n\nIf six figures is beyond your budget, the Universal Gen\u00e8ve Tri-Compax Reference 12552 might prove a timely investment. The first triple calendar moonphase chronograph wristwatch, it was announced at the 1944 Basel Watch Fair to commemorate the brand\u2019s 50th anniversary. US president Harry S Truman wore a gold one at the Potsdam Conference in 1945. Versions with a white dial range from $12,000 to $20,000; with the black dial, from $60,000 to $80,000.\n\nPrices for the Gallet Clamshell Flying Officer are rising \u2013 up to $30,000.\n\nThe Gallet Clamshell Flying Officer is another gem from the 1940s. It\u2019s one of the first water-resistant chronographs from one of the earliest (circa 1466) clock makers. It was worn by high-ranking officers in the US Army Air Force during World War II, as well as, again, President Truman \u2013 obviously a watch aficionado. Its value? $35,000 and climbing.\n\nThe heritage issue of LUXURY is out on Friday, September 6 inside The Australian Financial Review.
