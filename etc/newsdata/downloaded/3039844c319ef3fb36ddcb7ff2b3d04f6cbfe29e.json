The sequel to the Brighton miracle lacked the drama and romance of four years ago but this, according to their fans, was when the Brave Blossoms truly came of age against the world rugby elite.\n\n\u201cI think South Africa looked down on Japan four years ago but today they knew they had to be at their best, and that\u2019s a huge compliment to Japan,\u201d said Shigeki Takagi, a company worker from Tokyo who had just witnessed his country play in a World Cup quarter-final for the first time. \u201cWe\u2019ve beaten Ireland and Scotland and now I think we\u2019re getting really close to the level of the northern hemisphere teams. Who knows what could happen four years from now?\u201d\n\nJapan\u2019s never-say-die spirit needs nurturing after Rugby World Cup | Andy Bull Read more\n\nSusumu Shiratori wiped away tears after the final whistle. \u201cI\u2019m overcome with emotion,\u201d said Shiratori, who had travelled from his home in Shizuoka prefecture, scene of Japan\u2019s first upset of the tournament, against Ireland in the pool stage. \u201cWe may have lost to South Africa but we\u2019ve moved to another level. Beating Ireland and Scotland was one thing \u2013 now we want to do the same to England and Wales.\u201d\n\nShiratori confessed he had only recently taken an interest in rugby, but he was not alone. \u201cEveryone\u2019s a fan now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a great sport. The way the players hit each other hard but then show sportsmanship at the end. And the same goes for the visiting supporters \u2013 they have been so friendly. It\u2019s been an honour to watch rugby with them.\u201d\n\nThe home contingent among the crowd of more than 48,000 spanned all generations \u2013 there were middle-aged couples, groups of teenagers and parents cradling children who may have just been old enough to remember the night that Japan\u2019s extraordinary run came to a noble end. There were as many women as men.\n\nTogether, they improved even on last weekend\u2019s rendition of Kimigayo. TV viewing figures have increased with each of Japan\u2019s matched and so too, it seems, has the decibel count for the host nation\u2019s national anthem.\n\nIt is too early to talk convincingly about legacy before the semi-finals have been played, but on the evidence of Sunday night, Japan\u2019s commitment to rugby will endure long after the final on 2 November.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so proud of them for getting this far,\u201d said Saho Kitawaki, a senior manager for a firm in Tokyo, said of captain Michael Leitch and his team. \u201cJapan\u2019s win over South Africa four years ago was big for rugby, but no one thought it would get this big. They may have lost tonight but they have made history.\u201d\n\nTakafumi Tamura, who has followed rugby for a quarter of a century, said: \u201cThis is way more than we were expecting, so I\u2019m not sad at all, even though we lost. This was another step forward, and now I can\u2019t wait for the World Cup in France.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nBefore and after the match, the home fans again showed why the South Africa coach, Rassie Erasmus, felt moved at the end of his press conference to pay tribute to them and their team. Some had sung the South African national anthem, helped by lyrics printed in katakana phonetic script. And at the end, they clapped the victors off the pitch and struck up conversations with traveling supporters.\n\nJapan\u2019s status as every neutral\u2019s second team was evident on the streets around the stadium, where fans in Ireland and France shirts sported temporary Hinomaru tattoos and hachimaki bandanas. They bore the kanji characters for tokon (fighting spirit); hissho (victory); and kamikaze (divine wind). Not all of them were the right way up, but none of the local fans seemed bothered in the slightest.\n\nSouth Africa to face Wales in semi-final after grinding down Japan Read more\n\nOn the eve of the quarterfinal The Yomiuri Shimbun \u2013 a conservative broadsheet not given to editorialising about rugby \u2013 said Japan had proved they have the ability to beat tier one teams and, as Erasmus confirmed, can give the best sides in the world genuine cause for concern.\n\n\u201cJapan\u2019s feat is drawing attention as an outstanding achievement that changes the rankings of rugby teams in the world, in which those from Europe and the Southern Hemisphere are ranked high,\u201d the newspaper said.\n\nAnd there was little you could dismiss as hyperbole in Bill Beaumont\u2019s pre-match comments. \u201cJapan 2019 is already one of the greatest Rugby World Cups, characterised by the incredible warmth and support of the Japanese public,\u201d the World Rugby chairman said. \u201cThese figures reflect the power of sport to unite a nation, the awakening of Japan to rugby and how the heroics of the Brave Blossoms have captured hearts and minds around the world.\u201d", "description": "A captivating run to the quarter-finals could provide an enduring rugby legacy in Japan", "authors": ["Justin Mccurry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4b2ce5d9ce54ff82f7808c32dcc3ce049408e14/0_319_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8c6f59df2623f5a94b3bb161a36e45c7", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
