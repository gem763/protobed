In addition to defending the nation and waging war against another, military has been used for internal population control, as the means of overthrowing a government, as a relief force in times of a disaster, as well as guard against important or otherwise under threat areas.\n\nThe biggest and the most prominent military alliance is the North Atlantic Treaty Organisations (NATO). Unlike the single country's military, the NATO works as an intergovernmental defence organisation whereas, if one member is under threat, the rest will come to aid. Each member country contributes either military personnel, aid or monetary support. Although inactive until the break-up of Yugoslavia, NATO is now present in a number of countries and engaged in a number of conflicts and is considered as one of the strongest intergovernmental militaries in the world.\n\nThe largest military in the world, by personnel, is the People's Republic of China, where almost seven million people are in the military service. In terms of military equipment however, the leading military is that of the United States of America, with over five times the military budget than next biggest military, People's Republic of China.\n\nMilitary and army area not to be confused with one another.
