This means data doesn't need to pass through servers controlled by internet and technology firms, essentially handing back people control of their data.\n\nWhen it was first launched, HTC described it as \"the first smartphone built for this new internet\", representing a paradigm shift away from the big data business models of large tech companies.\n\n\"All out private data - from credit history to search data - is handled by third parties,\" Phil Chen, who led the development of the HTC Exodus 1, told The Independent at the time.\n\n\"We don't own or control any of it. Instead, it is just seven companies in the world that control almost all of the data. They have become more powerful than governments.\"\n\nOne of the things that this new wave of phones could transform is payments, with each phone coming with an in-built cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nThis allows owners of these phones to store and spend cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, as well as forthcoming digital currencies set to be launched by apps like Telegram.", "description": "Samsung has built a blockchain version of its flagship Galaxy Note 10 smartphone, allowing customers to store cryptocurrency like bitcoin on their phones.
