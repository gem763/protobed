Earlier this week, word spread that Vulcan was trimming a significant number of jobs.\n\nStratolaunch reported the ownership handover today on Twitter and its website, without saying who the new owner is. However, information gleaned from the grapevine at Mojave Air and Space Port, where Stratolaunch\u2019s flight operations are based, suggests that private investors are playing a role.\n\nHere\u2019s Stratolaunch\u2019s statement:\n\n\u201cStratolaunch LLC has transitioned ownership and is continuing regular operations. Our near-term launch vehicle development strategy focuses on providing customizable, reusable, and affordable rocket-powered testbed vehicles and associated flight services. As we continue on our mission, Stratolaunch will bring the carrier aircraft test and operations program fully in-house. We thank Vulcan Inc. and Scaled Composites for turning an ambitious idea into a flight-proven aircraft.\u201d\n\nIn an email to GeekWire, Stratolaunch said it would not be granting interviews or sharing additional details at this time.\n\nStratolaunch owns the world\u2019s biggest airplane, a twin-fuselage monster with a 385-foot wingspan, and sent it up into the sky from Mojave Air and Space Port for its first and only test flight in April. The plane, which was built for Stratolaunch by Mojave-based Scaled Composites, is designed to drop as many as three rockets for a mid-flight launch to orbit.\n\nPaul Allen established Stratolaunch under Vulcan\u2019s aegis as a follow-up to his support for the SpaceShipOne rocket plane, which made use of a similar air-launch concept for crewed suborbital spaceflight.\n\nWhen the venture was founded, nearly eight years ago, Allen aimed to take advantage of a market for midsize satellite launches \u2014 and over time, Stratolaunch looked into other concepts, including a new type of rocket engine, hypersonic rocket planes and an air-launched orbital space plane.\n\nBut after Allen\u2019s death last October, Stratolaunch\u2019s workforce was dramatically scaled back. In recent weeks, the venture started posting key job openings again, and that now appears to be part of the plan for the ownership change.\n\nLast month, Virgin Galactic test pilot Nicola Pecile spread the word that Stratolaunch would be ramping up again, and hinted at what was behind the ramp-up. Virgin Galactic is headquartered just down the street from Stratolaunch\u2019s giant hangar.\n\n\u201cLooks like they found some investors,\u201d Pecile reported in a Sept. 18 tweet. \u201cHiring of test pilots was just sent out to SETP [Society of Experimental Test Pilots] members the other day. I\u2019m expecting a big announcement soon! Which is great, would have been too bad to not continuing with the test program\u2026\u201d\n\nIn the absence of other information, several factors suggest that Northrop Grumman may play a key role in the Stratolaunch transition. The company already has Scaled Composites as a subsidiary. It has long experience in air-launch systems by virtue of its acquisition of Orbital Sciences Corp. And according to Spaceflight Now, Northrop Grumman recently reacquired the Pegasus XL rockets it was assembling for Stratolaunch\u2019s use.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Northrop Grumman for comment and will update this report with anything we can pass along.\n\nDuring the buildup to April\u2019s test flight, Stratolaunch said it aimed to get its carrier plane fully certified by the Federal Aviation Administration and ready for launch operations after 18 months to two years of flight tests. It\u2019s not clear whether the venture would follow the same timeline under new ownership, and there\u2019s even a chance that the new owners will pivot to a completely different business model.\n\nMore from GeekWire:", "description": "Stratolaunch, the company that was founded by the late Seattle billionaire Paul Allen in 2011 to build a flying launch pad for rockets, says it's under new ownership.
