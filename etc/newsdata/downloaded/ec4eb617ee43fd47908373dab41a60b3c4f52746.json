Federal prosecutors recommended Friday the actress serve 30 days in jail, receive twelve months of supervised release, and pay a fine of $20,000 for her part in the college admissions fraud scandal known as Operation Varsity Blues.\n\nYou may remember that earlier this year Huffman pleaded guilty to charges of committing mail fraud and honest services fraud in connection with a $15,000 payment to an SAT examination proctor. The proctor was paid to correct her daughter Sophia\u2019s answers on the test so that she got a higher score.\n\nBy comparison, Huffman\u2019s $15,000 payment to make sure her daughter gained admission to the college of her choice looks like she got a bargain. Other parents caught up by the FBI\u2019s investigation paid much more and went to greater lengths, like submitting phony pictures of their child\u2019s participation as a member of a sports team. Some even gamed affirmative action quotas. Fellow actress Lori Loughlin and her husband paid $500,000 and did the phony photoshoot in order for their daughter to get into USC.\n\nIn the filing by federal prosecutors, they wrote that Huffman\u2019s action was \u201cdeliberate and manifestly criminal.\u201d They made the case that to sentence the actress to home confinement would not be punishment at all, given her luxury home in the Hollywood Hills.\n\nThey recommended that, after spending a month in jail, she should also have a year of supervised release. \u201cIn the context of this case, neither probation nor home confinement (in a large home in the Hollywood Hills with an infinity pool) would constitute meaningful punishment or deter others from committing similar crimes,\u201d the prosecutors wrote. They added that Huffman\u2019s \u201cefforts weren\u2019t driven by need or desperation, but by a sense of entitlement, or at least moral cluelessness, facilitated by wealth and insularity.\u201d \u201cMillions of parents send their kids to college every year. But they don\u2019t buy fake SAT scores and joke about it (\u201cRuh Ro!\u201d) along the way,\u201d they added, referring to an email Huffman wrote in 2017.\n\nHuffman\u2019s attorneys countered with a request for no jail time, a one-year term of probation, and 250 hours of community service. She would still pay the $20,000 fine called for in her guilty plea. With all the publicity that Operation Varsity Blues has garnered in the press, though, I find it difficult to believe that such a high profile participant, albeit a lesser player, will walk without any time behind bars. The pressure to punish the wealthy for pursuing special treatment for their kids at the expense of hard-working middle-class students will be strong.\n\nMs. Huffman wrote a letter to the judge in anticipation of her sentencing. It is a rather humble and apologetic letter describing her remorse and what her actions have done to her family. She also reminded the judge that her daughter suffers from learning disabilities.\n\nHuffman wrote the three-page letter to the judge in an attempt to offer \u201ca broader perspective and insight into who I am as a person and a parent.\u201d In it, she acknowledged that she takes \u201ccomplete responsibility for my actions and will respectfully accept whatever punishment the court deems appropriate.\u201d The When They See Us star claimed that she \u201cdidn\u2019t go shopping for a college counselor to find out how to rig a SAT score\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t even know such a scheme existed.\u201d She wrote that she had been seeking advice from doctors and experts because Sophia \u201cwas diagnosed with learning disabilities, and she has been retested every three years\u201d since the age of 8. \u201cAs painful as this has been, I am truly grateful for the lessons I have learned and for the opportunity to change and live more honestly,\u201d she concluded her letter. \u201cI am now focusing on repairing my relationship with my daughter, my family and making amends to my community.\u201d\n\nShe wrote that she struggled with her decision for six weeks and then the \u201cdecision haunted me terribly.\u201d She didn\u2019t do the same for her younger daughter, Georgia. She claims she was just trying to be a good mother. Sadly, her daughter is devastated that her mom didn\u2019t think she could do it on her own.\n\n\u201cIn my desperation to be a good mother I talked myself into believing that all I was doing was giving my daughter a fair shot,\u201d the Desperate Housewives alum, 56, wrote to U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani of Massachusetts on Wednesday, September 4. \u201cI see the irony in that statement now because what I have done is the opposite of fair. I have broken the law, deceived the educational community, betrayed my daughter, and failed my family.\u201d When Sophia learned about her mother\u2019s involvement in the nationwide bribery scam, she \u201clooked at me,\u201d Huffman wrote, \u201cand asked with tears streaming down her face, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you believe in me? Why didn\u2019t you think I could do it on my own?\u2019\u201d \u201cI had no adequate answer for her,\u201d the actress admitted. \u201cI could only say, \u2018I am sorry. I was frightened and I was stupid.\u2019 In my blind panic, I have done the exact thing I was desperate to avoid. I have compromised my daughter\u2019s future, the wholeness of my family and my own integrity.\u201d\n\nShe may not have been \u201cshopping\u201d for a scheme to get her daughter accepted into college but she obviously knew what she was doing \u2013 buying her child\u2019s admission \u2013 was wrong. Did she know it was also illegal? That part is unclear to me. She certainly never expected to find herself being prosecuted for it.\n\nHuffman has lots of friends willing to write letters to the judge on her behalf and beg for her not to serve jail time. Her husband did the same, too. That is a part of this story that I haven\u2019t figured out \u2013 how has her husband, actor William H. Macy \u2013 escaped this mess?\n\nEva Longoria, a co-star in \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d, penned a letter for her friend. While it is understandable that Huffman\u2019s friends would like to see her avoid jail time, prosecutors could have sought a sentence of up to six months in jail. Thirty days sounds like a slap on the wrist.\n\nHer sentencing is scheduled for September 13", "description": "Friends pen letters of support to judge for leniency.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/98df2efc-4dfc-4476-8d37-738f97a58adf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
