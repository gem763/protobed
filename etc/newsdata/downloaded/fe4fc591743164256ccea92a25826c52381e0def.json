I sang it the best that I could. I do well up when I think of John this deeply. And I\u2019ve done my best. We\u2019ve done our best.\n\n\u201cThe other good thing is that I really wanted Paul to play on it and he said yes. Paul came over and he played bass and sings a little bit on this with me.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSo, John\u2019s on it in a way. I\u2019m on it and Paul\u2019s on it. It\u2019s not a publicity stunt. This is just what I wanted. And the strings that Jack arranged for this track, if you really listen, they do one line from [Harrison\u2019s] Here Comes the Sun. So in a way, it\u2019s the four of us.\u201d\n\nHarrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr have worked together on a number of records since the Beatles split up in 1970, including Starr\u2019s last album, Give More Love.\n\nThe track, recorded in Starr\u2019s home studio, features on What\u2019s My Name, his 20th solo album, which also features a number of regular contributors and members of his touring All-Starr Band. It will be released in October.\n\nThis week, the Guardian was given access to a rare recording of the band\u2019s discussions while they recorded Abbey Road.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a revelation,\u201d the historian Mark Lewisohn said of the find. \u201cThe books have always told us that they knew Abbey Road was their last album and they wanted to go out on an artistic high. But no \u2013 they\u2019re discussing the next album. And you think that John is the one who wanted to break them up but, when you hear this, he isn\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t that rewrite pretty much everything we thought we knew?\u201d", "description": "Grow Old With Me is latest collaboration between the surviving Beatles members", "authors": ["Mattha Busby"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ee2bea12b92b28eff10b84d22e952c2681cb5f5/0_479_2239_1343/master/2239.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=507c1198707be631a1471241bc42a87a", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
