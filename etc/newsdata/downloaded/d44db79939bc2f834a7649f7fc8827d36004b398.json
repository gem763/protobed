Steny Hoyer\n\nRob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association, and Jim Nussle, president and CEO of the Credit Union National Association, in an opinion piece for FOX Business, argued for the bill noting, \"Passing the SAFE Banking Act would mark a step forward for public safety in this country and would give financial institutions the certainty they need to fully support their communities. It would also demonstrate that Congress can still come together to solve the nation\u2019s challenges.\"\n\nNext up is the Republican-controlled Senate, where it could be amended to gain passage. Its bill has 33 cosponsors, which means that a third of the chamber is now formally signed onto the legislation, counting its main sponsor Sen. Jeff Merkley, Democrat from Oregon. It is not clear if President Donald Trump would sign any version that reaches his desk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupporters of the SAFE Act argue the move will boost public safety, improve transparency and ease the financing crunch facing the multibillion-dollar marijuana industry.\n\nThe bill also prohibits federal regulators from terminating or limiting deposit insurance - which discouraged banks from offering financial services to cannabis or hemp businesses - and bars them from incentivizing or encouraging a bank to close accounts on the sole reason that a person is affiliated with a cannabis or hemp business.\n\nMarijuana is legal in the District of Columbia and 11 states - Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington \u2013 but it still remains illegal under federal law, something a leading Democrat sees this bill influencing.\n\n\u201cI am proud to bring this legislation to the Floor, but I believe it does not go far enough,\u201d said Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. \u201cThis must be a first step toward the decriminalization and de-scheduling of marijuana, which has led to the prosecution and incarceration of far too many of our fellow Americans for possession.\n\n\u201cI look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to make progress on this issue and reform federal marijuana laws, including de-scheduling marijuana and providing relief to individuals and communities disproportionally affected by racial biases in the way federal marijuana laws have been enforced.\u201d\n\nDemocrats said they added provisions to the bill that they hope will bring some GOP senators to their side. Backers from both sides of the political aisle also hope that increasing public support to legalize the recreational and medical uses of cannabis might sway senators up for re-election in 2020. Nevada Rep. Dina Titus (D) tweeted in celebration of passing.\n\nAs did, Rep. Deb Haaland, who represents New Mexico\u2019s first district and was a co-sponsor of the bill: \u201cAccess to safe banking is a big deal for the businesses and employees in New Mexico who work in the cannabis industry.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "House passes first-ever stand-alone cannabis industry bill.", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Marijuana-banking-bill.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
