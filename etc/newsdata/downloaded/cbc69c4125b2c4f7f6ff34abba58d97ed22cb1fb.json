They could go through as - technically - the only side with a perfect record in the tournament.\n\nAustralia are already through, and will play England unless Uruguay stun Wales.\n\nMatches left: Australia v Georgia - Friday, Shizuoka; Wales v Uruguay - Sunday, Kumamoto.", "description": "With the news that two World Cup pool matches have been called off, and another under review, there is some confusion over who will finish where.
