We didn\u2019t think it was right to do it this month because it\u2019s too far away from the games, but we have to hope... we\u2019re not confident that we\u2019ll go there and nothing will happen.\u201d\n\nNext month\u2019s qualifier will be England\u2019s first trip to Bulgaria since September 2011, when a 3-0 win was overshadowed by racist abuse in Sofia.\n\nAshley Young was subjected to monkey chants during that game, but the Bulgarian Football Union (BFS) only received a 40,000 euros (\u00a334,000) fine by UEFA for \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d chanting and for the lighting and throwing of fireworks.\n\nThe Vasil Levski National Stadium will already be partially closed for England\u2019s latest visit due to the racist behaviour of their supporters in the 2-1 loss in the Czech Republic in June.\n\nThe BFS is required to block off at least 5,000 seats for the visit of Southgate\u2019s men and display a banner with the wording \u2018\u00a3EqualGame\u2019.\n\nBulgaria\u2019s return fixture against the Czechs is also due to be played at a partially-closed ground due to racist behaviour in the 3-2 home loss to Kosovo in their other June fixture.\n\nAnd just last month, Bulgarian sides Levski Sofia and PFC Lokomotiv Plovdiv 1926 were both ordered to play their next UEFA matches in partially-closed stadiums due to racist behaviour in their respective Europa League qualifiers.\n\nIt is a depressing state of affairs, as are the concerns surrounding England fan behaviour on the trip to the Czech Republic in the days leading up to the trip to Bulgaria.\n\nUEFA\u2019s scheduling of the Group A qualifier in the party city of Prague on a Friday night has set off alarm bells, with the FA\u2019s head of security Tony Conniford raising concerns over the timing of the match following issues at the Nations League.\n\nFan disturbances involving some England supporters in Portugal over the summer compounded flare-ups in Amsterdam and Seville last year, with Southgate saying \u201cit\u2019s sad we have to appeal\u201d to those going to behave.\n\n\u201cIt should be a given \u2013 sadly it isn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cSadly, we are going to a place where people go, travel anyway for nights out from our country. What we don\u2019t need to see is behaviour that I am afraid happens on our own high streets, so it is not something that is just England supporters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that it is a societal issue of people with alcohol unable to control themselves. But we certainly don\u2019t want to be taking that abroad and that being a representation of our country.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Raheem Sterling was the target of alleged racist abuse from a Bulgaria fan during England\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier at Wembley \u2013 and Gareth Southgate fears his players could be subjected to more in next month\u2019s return fixture in Sofia.
