That was the highest monthly total on record.\n\nAs of the end of August, 1,009 CEOs had decamped from their firms, 15% more than the 879 who had left as of August the previous year. Why are so many CEOs leaving their posts this year? Some may have been pushed out, as is the case of WeWork CEO Adam Neumann, whose erratic behavior made headlines as the co-working space company geared up to go public.\n\nOther departures coincided with outside pressures on the company, such as e-cigarette company Juul\u2019s CEO Kevin Burns, who left amid an epidemic of vaping related deaths. The same day the Burns resignation was announced, eBay\u2019s Devin Wenig said he was leaving due to conflicts with the board, which had been shaken up recently at the behest of activist investors.\n\nGraphic Credit: David Foster/Yahoo Finance More\n\nOther CEOs like Bloomin\u2019 Brands Liz Smith explicitly left because of a \u201cplanned succession.\u201d And while the occasional CEO like marijuana company Canopy Growth\u2019s Bruce Linton might shout from the rooftops that they got canned, the real reasons for many top-chief departures may never be known.\n\nStill, an educated observer can look at the context surrounding a CEO\u2019s departure and surmise that they were likely pushed out. In August of this year, Exchange, which tracks executive departures, published an analysis showing that one in two CEOs steps down under \u201chigh pressure.\u201d The report looked at 515 CEO departures in the U.S. in the past 24 months and examined a number of factors \u2014 from whether their tenure was \u201cexcessively short\u201d to the tone of the departure announcement.\n\nWhile the report used that context to determine the presence of \u201chigh pressure,\u201d it found that only 2.9% of CEOs were ousted with a specific reference to misconduct. The above graphic shows major CEO departures announced in 2019. Indeed, CEOs who were explicitly axed were few and far between. Wells Fargo\u2019s Tim Sloan officially \u201cretired,\u201d but his resignation came suddenly and after a seemingly never-ending series of scandals.\n\nIn the final three months of 2019, we may see even more resignations, some expected and others sudden and still others spurred by outside economic forces. Andy Challenger, a vice president at Challenger, Gray, & Christmas, recently suggested in a Fortune magazine interview that the faltering economic situation might spur some CEOs to leave their posts.\n\n\u201cWith a lot of tensions on the horizon,\u201d he said, \u201csome CEOs are finding now is the time to put their succession plans into action.\"\n\nErin Fuchs is deputy managing editor at Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead more:\n\nJuul, eBay CEOs just got axed \u2014 clearly there is a big leadership crisis in America\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.\n\nAll Markets Summit More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "In just the past few weeks, the top executives at major U.S. companies including WeWork, eBay, and Juul have left or been forced out of their posts \u2014 but they are just the latest exits in a year with an unusually high number of CEO departures.", "authors": ["Erin Fuchs", "Deputy Managing Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oyI.nZxcpBnGrusqb7pVbw--~B/aD03MDY7dz0xMTQ2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/cd43b4b0-e61c-11e9-9dae-a779bafd49e1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
