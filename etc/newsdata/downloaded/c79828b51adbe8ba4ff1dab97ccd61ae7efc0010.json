No surprise really.\n\nThe All-Blacks missed out on completing a 100% run after their final Pool game against Italy was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis meaning the match was awarded as a draw.\n\nHead coach Steve Hansen will have his eyes on an unprecedented third consecutive World Cup victory but they face Ireland in the quarter-finals.\n\nSouth Africa - 3/1\n\nBack them here\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSouth Africa have the ingredients for the perfect revenge dish.\n\nAfter losing to Japan in arguably the greatest match on the World Cup stage (or any stage for that matter) now have the chance to knock-out their opponents on their own turf.\n\nThe Japanese defence will need to keep a close eye on South Africa's pace - especially Cheslin Kolbe because my word can he run!\n\nLet's hope both sides have kept their notes from last month's friendly.\n\nEngland - 4/1\n\nBack them here\n\nEddie Jones' team look untroubled. The cancellation in their final Pool game against France might have frustrated some fans but the extra rest could benefit England greatly.\n\nThe side's maturity will be tested as they face an Australia side when Michael Cheika attempts to create a siege mentality amongst the Wallabies.\n\nEngland will need to utilise Owen Farrell for his best game yet if they are to go through to the semi-finals.\n\nWales - 8/1\n\nBack them here\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWales keep on grinding results and have rightly gone through to the quarter-final stages as Pool winners - the first time since 1999.\n\nWarren Gatland witnessed his side wake up against Georgia; get battered against Australia; take on a complacent Fiji side and cruise by Uruguay.\n\nAll while coming away with 100% win record in the competition - they now face France who have had the advantage of having their match against England cancelled so more time to prepare for their quarter-final clash.\n\nNaturally, Wales will need Alun Wyn Jones on his best form - he is their leader after all.\n\nIreland 16/1\n\nBack them here\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nAfter flirting with the number one ranking position, Ireland have returned as a team under the radar.\n\nThey have managed to go through the Pool stages with the odd banana skin of losing in a close-fought defeat to Japan before the hosts beat Scotland in their last game to give the Irish a place in the quarter-final.\n\nThey could not have asked for a more difficult tie when they face New Zealand in Tokyo but Ireland are not unfamiliar with a win over the All Blacks.\n\nThey know what they can offer and the All Blacks do not like it.\n\nAustralia 20/1\n\nBack them here\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nThe Wallabies have not exactly dazzled during this competition.\n\nThe Aussies come into this as a team underrated which could well benefit Michael Cheika's squad if England's mature heads are not in the game.\n\nDavid Pocock played a blinder in the last World Cup and, at the age of 31, looks like the number 8 is giving his all for one last chance to become a world champion.\n\nJapan 33/1\n\nBack them here\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThe hosts have warmed the hearts of every neutral going in the sport - and caused pandamonium in every street, town and city across Japan when they beat Scotland last weekend.\n\nThey successfully won the group stage and are only the second nation with a 100% record so far after Typhoon Hagibis nearly disrupted their last Pool game.\n\nYu Tamura is their key man with 48 points from the fly-half and will be crucial in their match against 2007 winners South Africa.\n\nFrance 33/1\n\nBack them here\n\n(Image: FRANCK FIFE/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSafe to say, France are a team with fickle performances and can go from one extreme to the other and their quarter-final opponents Wales found that out in their Six Nations clash.\n\nFrance can be an unbreakable force and an immovable object at the same time - as Wales discovered in the first-half.\n\nOr they can just show their complacency and hand their opponents the win on a plate - as Wales discovered in the second-half.", "description": "All the latest odds ahead of this weekend's quarter-final", "authors": ["Tom Phillips", "Image", "Franck Robichon Epa-Efe Rex", "Afp Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Getty", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Reuters", "Franck Fife Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20083226.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Rugby-World-Cup-2019-opening-press-conference-Tokyo-Japan-17-Sep-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
