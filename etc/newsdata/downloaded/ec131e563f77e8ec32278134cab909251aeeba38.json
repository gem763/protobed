Turkish investigators said the journalist, a vocal critic of Prince Mohammad\u2019s, was murdered and then dismembered by a team of Saudi agents.\n\n\u201cThis was a heinous crime,\u201d bin Salman said, when asked by anchor Norah O\u2019Donnell whether he had a role in the reporter\u2019s grisly slaying. \u201cBut I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to elaborate, the crown prince added: \u201cWhen a crime is committed against a Saudi citizen by officials, working for the Saudi government, as a leader I must take responsibility. This was a mistake. And I must take all actions to avoid such a thing in the future.\u201d\n\nO'Donnell: Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?\n\n\n\nCrown Prince Mohammad bin Salman: \"Absolutely not.

The CIA came to a similar conclusion.\n\nSaudi public prosecutors, however, ended up charging 11 men for the murder. Saud al-Qahtani, once the crown prince\u2019s right-hand man, has been accused of helping to plan the killing; but he was not among the 11 charged.\n\nSpeaking to \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d bin Salman reiterated his claim that he\u2019d known nothing about the planned attack.\n\n\u201cSome think that I should know what three million people working for the Saudi government do daily? It\u2019s impossible that the three million would send their daily reports to the leader or the second highest person in the Saudi government,\u201d he said.\n\nThe royal also pushed back against the suggestion that the American government had implicated him in the murder.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t an official statement announced by the American government in this regard,\u201d he told O\u2019Donnell, later adding that the Saudi relationship with the U.S. is \u201cmuch larger\u201d than this one case.\n\n\u201cOur role is to work day and night to overcome this and to make sure our future is much better than anything that happened in the past,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo of the crown prince\u2019s closest advisors are accused of orchestrating the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. \u201cHow could you not know [about the murder]?\u201d Norah O\u2019Donnell asks MBS https://t.co/A3GvK7eCCm pic.twitter.com/KpypiDFV4M \u2014 60 Minutes (@60Minutes) September 30, 2019\n\nThough U.S. intelligence officials have stood by their assertion that the crown prince was responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s killing, President Donald Trump has rebuffed their conclusions and has repeatedly expressed his support of the crown prince.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the leader of Saudi Arabia. They\u2019ve been a very good ally,\u201d Trump said in December.\n\n\u201cI really hope that people aren\u2019t going to suggest that we should not take hundreds of billions of dollars that they\u2019re going to siphon off to Russia and to China,\u201d the president added, referring to lucrative arms deals between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Sunday that Trump helped rehabilitate Prince Mohammad\u2019s image on the global stage following the Khashoggi killing.\n\n\u201cU.S. and Saudi officials have been playing the same game of hoping the controversy over Jamal\u2019s murder will die with time or be overtaken by other more immediate events,\u201d David Ottaway, a Persian Gulf expert, told the paper.", "description": "\"This was a heinous crime,\" bin Salman told \"60 Minutes\" in a new interview. \"But I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia.\"", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d917d7a2100005b00fdf3bd.jpeg?cache=qpnbbrnrrn&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
