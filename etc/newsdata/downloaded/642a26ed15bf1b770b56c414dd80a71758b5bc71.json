Katie Hill Denies Affair With Aide, Says Capitol Police Investigating Distribution of Nude Photo", "language": "en", "text": "California Rep. Katie Hill on Tuesday denied allegations that she had an improper relationship with an aide, blaming the \u201csmear campaign\u201d on \u201cRepublican operatives\u201d and an \u201cabusive husband.\u201d Hill added that U.S. Capitol Police are investigating how a nude photo of her was distributed and published online without her consent.\n\n\u201cI am going through a divorce from an abusive husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me,\u201d Hill, a Democrat who was elected in 2018 to represent California\u2019s 25th district, said in a statement. \u201cI am disgusted that my opponents would seek to exploit such a private matter for political gain. This coordinated effort to try to destroy me and people close to me is despicable and will not succeed. I, like many women who have faced attacks like this before, am stronger than those who want me to be afraid.\u201d\n\nConservative news site RedState on Friday first published an allegation that Hill began an affair with Graham Kelly while he was serving as her campaign finance director. In her statement, Hill says the report is \u201cabsolutely false.\u201d\n\nKelly is currently Hill\u2019s legislative director. The U.S. House official code of conduct prohibits members of Congress from engaging in sexual relationships with their congressional aides.\n\nKelly did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hill\u2019s husband, Kenny Heslep, who filed for divorce in July, could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI am saddened that the deeply personal matter of my divorce has been brought into public view and the vindictive claims of my ex have now involved the lives and reputations of unrelated parties,\u201d Hill said in her statement.\n\nRedState also published photos of Hill and a woman who they allege had been involved in a polyamorous relationship with Hill and Heslep. The unnamed woman was also, RedState reported, a staffer on Hill\u2019s campaign. In one image, Hill is nude and appears to be brushing the woman\u2019s hair.\n\nHill, 32, said she notified U.S. Capitol Police about the nude photo and said they were investigating \u201cpotential legal violations of those who posted and distributed the photos.\u201d A Capitol Police spokesperson said Wednesday that they do not comment on ongoing investigations.\n\nSome of Hill\u2019s supporters have argued that the distribution of the photo is an example of \u201crevenge porn\u201d \u2014 sexually explicit images shared without a victim\u2019s consent, often with the intent of harassing or humiliating them \u2014 which is illegal in California.\n\nWrite to Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com.", "description": "California Rep.
