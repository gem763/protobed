(If you\u2019ve seen the doc, you know that Beyonc\u00e9 subjected herself to a grueling workout routine and a restrictive, plant-based diet prior to Coachella. Of course, not every woman is super eager to lose weight after pregnancy, but with her performance fast approaching, the \u201cRun The World\u201d singer was.)\n\nWhen Bey FaceTimes Jay-Z to show off her progress \u2015 she\u2019s thrilled that an old bodysuit not only fits, but zips up! \u2015 the hip-hop mogul\u2019s response is pretty lackluster: Jay offers his wife a smile and a casual \u201call rightttt.\u201d\n\nBeyonc\u00e9, clearly disappointed, replies, \u201cAll right, just had to share.\u201d\n\nWatching that scene, Clinton, who\u2019s given birth to three kids of her own, was not having it.\n\n\u201cI said [to my husband], \u2018Marc, if that\u2019s ever me, you better have more enthusiasm,\u2019\u201d Clinton told The Cut. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the \u2018I\u2019m so proud of you. That\u2019s amazing\u2019 that I arguably think any woman deserves, particularly someone who has clearly worked herself body, mind, heart, soul and spirit to get to that place.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s husband, Marc Mezvinsky, replied, \u201cDuly noted.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018I bet every woman watching this has this sense of, she deserves more enthusiasm,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cMarc was like, \u2018I got it. Can we go back to watching it, please? We\u2019ve talked about it three times in the last 90 seconds.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the doc, the 38-year-old singer talks openly about the sacrifices that went into preparing for such an elaborate, high-stakes show just six months after giving birth.\n\nReconnecting with her body and mind postpartum wasn\u2019t easy, she tells the cameras.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my first time back home on the stage after giving birth. I\u2019m creating my own homecoming and it\u2019s hard,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were days that I thought I\u2019d never be the same. I\u2019d never be the same physically. My strength and endurance would never be the same.\u201d\n\nSomething tells us Beyonc\u00e9 will appreciate Clinton\u2019s support, given her history with the family. Both she and Jay-Z endorsed Hillary Clinton during her 2016 bid for the presidency, even bringing Clinton onstage at a Cleveland concert just four days before the election.", "description": "The former first daughter thought the rapper could have had \"more enthusiasm\" for his wife's post-baby weight loss, as seen in the Netflix documentary...", "authors": ["Senior Lifestyle Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db9f6a02100002f3834b83f.jpeg?cache=sDBiNGoIhz&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
