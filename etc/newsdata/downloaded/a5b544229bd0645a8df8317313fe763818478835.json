Currently open for pre-orders, the 64GB models of Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are priced at SG$1,119 and SG$1,319, respectively, while the 128GB options are available at SG$1,269 and SG$1,469, respectively.\n\nThe smartphones will sport three colours, Just Black, Clearly White, and the limited edition Oh So Orange, with the Pixel 4 spanning 5.7 inches and the Pixel 4 XL at 6.3 inches.\n\nThe Google devices also will be available through StarHub from October 26, with options for mobile plans comprising no upfront cost, but the local telco has yet to provide further information on prices. Tipped as the only operator to offer the new Pixel range in Singapore, StarHub said it would reveal full pricing details at launch.\n\nIn addition to the smartphones, Google also unveiled new releases of the Nest Mini and Nest Wifi. Priced at SG$79, the Nest Mini will be available via Google Store and at Challenger and Courts from October 23.\n\nThe Nest Wifi system encompasses a router, priced at SG$229, and Wi-Fi point, priced at SG$199, and is touted to deliver almost double the speed and up to 25% improvement in coverage. The Wi-Fi point also is equipped with a speaker and integrated with Google Assistant.\n\nMost details of the new Pixel had been available online following months of leaks, but Google did highlight a \"deeper integration\" with Google Assistant and advancements in speech processing that would enable more requests on the phone, without sending all of them to the cloud.\n\nA new Recorder app also offered simultaneous transcribing--though, only English was supported for now--and would be able to identify sounds such as music and applause. More languages would be added \"soon\", according to Google.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nPixel 4 specs vs price: Google's new phone is too weak, too late, and too expensive\n\nIs the Pixel 4 an overpriced disappointment when compared with rival devices from Apple and Samsung?\n\nWhere Google's Pixel 4 and Apple's iPhone 11 fail\n\nHey, smartphone makers, wake up!\n\nGoogle's Pixel 4, Pixel 4XL, and Made by Google hardware event squeezed by Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft launches\n\nGoogle's Made by Google hardware event will take the wraps off of the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4XL, but preceding events from the likes of Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have upped the ante for products today as well as 2020.\n\nA Google exec admits the ugly truth about the smart home\n\nGoogle has suddenly decided that the smart home needs rebranding.
