(Jean Delisle/CBC)\n\nA city memo says OSEG is paying the city $143,521 for the naming rights and managing a $25,000 annual dedicated programming fund.\n\nThe city memo says plans also include a Christmas Market in the plaza starting in November 2019, projected to attract 25,000 visitors.\n\nCouncillor welcomes change\n\nCoun. Shawn Menard welcomed the proposed changes from OSEG and said the reduction of traffic will make the park easier to navigate by bike or on foot.\n\n\"Once we get the cars off the site it'll be much more intuitive, so we're going to keep pushing for that and more change there,\" he said.\n\nOSEG CEO Mark Goudie said the partnership will be presenting the city with the results of its strategic review on Lansdowne Park in November. (CBC)\n\nHe said consultations with his constituents showed an interest in more free events, wintertime community events and less driving on the site.\n\nMenard said he's looking forward to continue working with OSEG on the site and he wants to keep the public parts of Lansdowne public.\n\nCar traffic was banned by the Aberdeen Pavillion Tuesday, but the installation of the stage infrastructure and shaded seating areas is expected for spring 2020.\n\nOSEG said it would be presenting an updated strategic plan for Lansdowne in June. Goudie said that has been delayed until November.", "description": "The partnership behind Lansdowne Park has closed off a section of Princess Patricia Way to cars as part of a plan to create\u00a0a \"social meeting space\"\u00a0at a revamped public square.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5295987.1569358828!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/lansdowne-park.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
