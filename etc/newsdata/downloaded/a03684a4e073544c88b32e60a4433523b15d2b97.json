He declared July\u2019s rate cut was a \u201cmid-cycle adjustment,\u201d a head-scratcher that markets initially thought meant the Fed would go no further.\n\nA rate cut this week would mean the Fed has erased three of the four rate increases last year when the economy was picking up steam, before the tariff battle began to slow activity and freeze investment.\n\nThe normally dovish Charles Evans of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank said earlier this month that interest rate policy is already \u201cin a good place\u201d as it is.\n\nBut Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, who in January will become a voting member of the Fed\u2019s rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, said policymakers should avoid suggesting they will stop here.\n\n\u201cThis is a really fragile time where this could break either way. The jury is still very much out,\u201d he said, according to The Wall Street Journal.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 US central bankers on Tuesday began a two-day policy meeting amid overwhelming expectations they will deliver the year\u2019s", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/bd7967_week-meeting-balancing-act-fed-chairman-jerome-powell-us-fed-opens-meeting-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
