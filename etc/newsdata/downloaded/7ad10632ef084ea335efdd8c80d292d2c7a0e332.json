But not happening with more shows than that,\" Netflix responded to Complex Pop Culture, which had tweeted a story with the headline \"Multiple Netflix Series Will Now Drop Episodes Weekly Instead of All at Once.\"\n\nIt's true that Netflix uses a staggered release strategy for a few shows, such as variety and competition programs. The reports suggested that it would expand this to its scripted originals. But Netflix said this wasn't the case.\n\nOne person tweeted: \"Say it ain't so! I love binging, and typically wait for week to week shows finish each season so I can binge them. You don't need to change.\" Netflix responded with \"it aint so.\"\n\nHere are the examples we found of Netflix responding to reports on Twitter:", "description": "Multiple publications wrote that Netflix was changing its TV release strategy, but the streaming giant says there is nothing new happening.", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d710c5c2e22af65e1504145-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
