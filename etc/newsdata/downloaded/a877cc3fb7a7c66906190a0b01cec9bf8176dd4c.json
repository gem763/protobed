The absence of two key players for Sunday is a sizeable blow as the manager seeks to arrest a form slump in which United have not won in the league for more than a month.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r needs more time and respect at Manchester United Read more\n\nPogba has not recovered from a foot injury while De Gea requires a scan after sustaining what appeared to be a groin problem in Spain\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier with Sweden on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cDavid needs a scan,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r told Sky Sports. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be out. It certainly looked like it anyway judging on last night so it\u2019s one of those things.\u201d Of Pogba, the Norwegian said: \u201cHe had a scan after the Arsenal game [at the end of last month] and maybe needed a few weeks\u2019 rest in a boot so hopefully he won\u2019t be too long, but he won\u2019t make this game, no.\u201dSolskj\u00e6r may also be without Jesse Lingard, while the availability of Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Anthony Martial is in the balance.\n\n\u201cHopefully Aaron and Anthony will last the training this week and be available for selection. If it\u2019s for half a game or 30 minutes I don\u2019t know but let\u2019s see where they\u2019re at,\u201d said Solskj\u00e6r.", "description": "Paul Pogba has been ruled out of Manchester United\u2019s Premier League match against Liverpool, with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r also believing David de Gea will be unavailable", "authors": ["Jamie Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f19a730344914d4cecc104e410f2e925064496a/168_136_2781_1669/master/2781.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a6239c8393361a2ce2e4d5fe46d22aa0", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
