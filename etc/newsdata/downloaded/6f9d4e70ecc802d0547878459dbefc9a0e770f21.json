As of the time of writing this, the leading cryptocurrency has dipped to $8,300 \u2014 a level which analyst Josh Rager has indicated as key for BTC to hold in order to maintain a formation of consecutively higher lows.\n\nAlthough there are some expecting for Bitcoin to soon break under $8,300, potentially to establish new multi-month lows under $7,000, an argument has been posed that as long as $7,700 holds, $10,000 is within BTC\u2019s grasp.\n\nBitcoin Price Ready to Retake $10,000?\n\nJosh Olszewicz, Brave New Coin analyst, recently took to Twitter to lay out Bitcoin\u2019s current chart structure, posing the question if BTC will hit $5,000 or $10,000 to his followers. He observed a confluence of both bullish and bearish factors, seemingly hinting that the market is undecided about where it should head next.\n\nDue to this, Olszewicz was asked by a follower if he is leaning long or short. Despite a few harrowing signs \u2014 namely Bitcoin being rejected by the 200-day exponential moving average and the Aligator indicator trending neutral/bearish \u2014 the analyst quipped that he expects for Bitcoin to rally by some 20% to $10,000 \u201cas long as $7,700 holds.\u201d\n\n10k as long as 7.7 holds if 7.7 doesnt hold it's gunna get ugly sideways for another week would be good here imo \u2014 Josh Olszewicz (@CarpeNoctom) October 11, 2019\n\nWhile Olszewicz\u2019s opinion may sound too optimistic to some cynical analysts, there are other tidbits of technical evidence to suggest that Bitcoin soon starts to move back to five-digit territory.\n\nRelated Reading: Analysts Expect Altcoins to Outperform as Bitcoin Price Stagnates\n\nBitcoin\u2019s one-day Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), a lagging indicator that tracks market trends and momentum, has crossed into the green after a precipitous drop to the most oversold levels since the December crash.\n\nAn analyst noted in reference to this technical indicator that bullish MACD crosses \u201calways were followed by price rises [previously],\u201d before adding that Bitcoin has the potential to reach $12,000 by November.\n\nAlso, Santiment found that Bitcoin\u2019s social volume [has] continu[ed] its quiet decline after hitting a recent two-year low.\u201d Indeed, BitInfo recently noted that the use of the \u201cBitcoin\u201d hashtag fell to a three-year low after peaking earlier this year during the pseudo-bull run in May/June.\n\n#Bitcoin $BTC's social volume continues its quiet decline after hitting its recent 2-year low. Historically, low social volume has preceded large price upswings and bull runs, and high social volume has been fairly reliable as a top indicator. https://t.co/4kl8hsb9Pk pic.twitter.com/z84qpJpk79 \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 8, 2019\n\nWhile many see this as a sign that Bitcoin will only fall further, even further than 40% from the year-to-date top of $14,000, Santiment argues that this can be interpreted as bullish. They wrote that historically, \u201clow social volume has preceded large price upswings and bull runs, and high social volume has been [a] fairly reliable top indicator.\u201d\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "On Saturday evening, the Bitcoin price started to show hints of weakness after a short bout of consolidation.
