For the Kurds, it is a matter of life and death. They will be forced to defend themselves, diverting resources from the maximum campaign pressure against ISIS.\u201d\n\nThe letter, which was forwarded to The Daily Beast by a Democratic staffer who posted portions of it on Twitter, told lawmakers to expect that the Turkish invasion will drive out Kurds and replace them with Syrian Arab refugees, fueling a resurgence of the Islamic State, and paving the way for broader hostilities in the region.\n\n\u201cThis is a disaster in the making,\u201d the Kurdish emissaries wrote. \u201cTherefore, it is in the best interest of all parties to prevent this from taking place while there is still time, and Washington is the only player in this equation that could stop this disaster in the making. The current pressure from the Hill is working and if sustained, has a good chance of getting President Trump to reverse this policy decision.\u201d\n\nThe letter went to every member of the House, and it called on them to appear in the press, write op-eds, tweet and take to the floors of the House and Senate to call attention to their plight and urge both Trump and Erdogan to deescalate the violence.\n\nIt is common for foreign governments to formally lobby lawmakers and make the case that their interests are aligned. Kurdistan\u2014though it is only recognized as a sub-national government\u2014is no different, and it has typically devoted significant resources toward retaining Washington lobbyists over the years.\n\nThe backdrop for this latest plea, however, is stark. The Kurdish office in Washington frequently sends updates to Capitol Hill, according to a House Democratic staffer, \u201cbut this one was particularly sad, being blunt on what\u2019s happening and about to happen.\u201d\n\nThe Kurds have long enjoyed a deep well of bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, thanks to their partnership in U.S. military ventures. And the sizable Christian population there has made the minority group a cause of great interest among American evangelical Christians.\n\nBecause of that, Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria has unleashed a torrent outrage from both sides of the aisle, and has prompted some Republicans to issue their strongest condemnations of his presidency to date. One GOP lawmaker, Rep. John Shimkus of Illinois, declared on Thursday that he would no longer support the president because of his Syria policy and its impact on the Kurds.\n\nThe fury has already translated into concrete congressional action. On Wednesday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) introduced legislation that would impose strict new sanctions on the Turkish government as long as their military is engaged in Syria.\n\nAnd several sources told The Daily Beast that similar or identical legislation is expected to be introduced shortly in the Democratic-controlled House. Democratic and Republican spokespeople for the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the likeliest venue for such a bill, did not offer specific details about a bill or a timeline for it.\n\nAdditional updates to lawmakers are planned, a Kurdish official told The Daily Beast, along with meetings and opportunities for advocacy when Congress returns from a two-week break next week.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is receiving a lot of painful messages from the Congress,\u201d said the official, who predicted that the outcry\u2014particularly from allies of the president\u2014is a good sign the pressure campaign could pay off.", "description": "A letter went out to all members on Thursday, urging them to help intervene in an increasingly dire situation.", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570772973/191010-Brodey-Kurds-tease_wrrf6e", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
