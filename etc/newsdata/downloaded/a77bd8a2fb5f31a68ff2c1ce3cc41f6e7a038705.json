The 6-year-old was then brought to the principal's office.\n\nCALIFORNIA WOMAN CAUGHT PUSHING $6,000 WORTH OF STOLEN QUARTERS IN BABY STROLLER, POLICE SAY\n\nKirkland told WKMG-TV that while there, a school staff employee grabbed Kaia's wrists, sparking her to lash out and kick her legs. The school resource officer \u2014 Officer Dennis Turner, of the Orlando Police Department \u2014 handcuffed Kaia and transported her to the Juvenile Assessment Center in Orlando on a battery charge.\n\nHer grandmother said the child was fingerprinted and had her mugshot taken.\n\nThe department didn't immediately return Fox News' request for comment. Sgt. David Baker told the news outlet that for arrests of people under the age of 12, officers are required to get permission from their watch commander \u2014 which he said Turner did not do.\n\nTEXAS MAN WANTED FOR DIVORCING HIS WIFE WITHOUT HER KNOWLEDGE\n\nKirkland claims that when she told Turner the 6-year-old has sleep apnea, which the family is \"working on getting resolved,\" the officer didn't understand why that would be an excuse for the child.\n\n\"He says, 'Well, I have sleep apnea, and I don't behave like that,'\" Kirkland claimed the officer told her.\n\nKirkland questioned how a child could be arrested for kicking somebody.\n\n\"How do you do that to a 6-year-old child and because she kicked somebody? ... A literal mug shot of a 6-year-old girl,\" she said. \"No 6-year-old child should be able to tell somebody that they had handcuffs on them and they were riding in the back of a police car and taken to a juvenile center to be fingerprinted, mug shot.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTurner also reportedly arrested an 8-year-old that day in a separate incident on Thursday, according to WKMG. Baker told the news outlet Turner did not request permission for that child's arrest, either. Authorities said an internal investigation is ongoing.\n\nKirkland says Kaia is supposed to report to court Oct. 16 and if she doesn't a warrant will be issued for her arrest.", "description": "A Florida grandmother claims her 6-year-old granddaughter was arrested by a resource officer after throwing a temper tantrum at school \u2014\u00a0which she says happened because the child suffers from sleep apnea.", "authors": ["Nicole Darrah", "Nicole Darrah Covers Breaking", "Trending News For Foxnews.Com.
