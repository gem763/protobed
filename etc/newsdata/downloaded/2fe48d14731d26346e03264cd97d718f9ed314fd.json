And we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nHe is sitting in a wood-and-leather chair in his Supreme Court chambers. He\u2019s discussing originalism, the idea that the Constitution\u2019s meaning is the same in 2019 as in 1788. \u201cOur Founders deliberately chose a written constitution,\u201d he says. \u201cIts writtenness was important to them. They rejected the English tradition of an unwritten constitution, because they wanted to fix certain things.\u201d\n\nTo treat the Constitution as a \u201cliving\u201d document, he says, is to regard it \u201cmore or less as a relic,\u201d something kept \u201cin the back of the church behind a screen, and you look at it as you walk by, and you move on.\u201d But that\u2019s \u201cnot what \u2018We the People\u2019 agreed to,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe didn\u2019t say five judges\u2014or nine, or whatever\u2014sitting in Washington get to govern 330 million people. Who would write such a thing down? Who would agree to that? That\u2019s not a republic. I don\u2019t know what that is, but it\u2019s not a republic. Not a democracy.\u201d\n\nIn his new book, \u201cA Republic, if You Can Keep It\u201d\u2014a mix of speeches, reflections and excerpts from his judicial opinions, to be published Sept. 10\u2014Justice Gorsuch makes the case, he says, that \u201cwe should all be originalists.\u201d Consider the alternative: \u201cWhat happens when judges make it up?\u201d he asks. \u201cStrange things happen. You start losing rights, first of all, that are in the Constitution.\u201d\n\nHe cites the Fourth Amendment\u2019s ban on \u201cunreasonable\u201d searches. \u201cAt common law that pretty much meant, hey, you can\u2019t go snooping around someone\u2019s house\u2014or the curtilage, the area around their house\u2014without a warrant,\u201d he says. Then, incredulous, he cites Florida v. Riley (1989), in which the justices \u201cheld that the police may, in a helicopter 400 feet above your house, hover and peer down without a warrant. They said that\u2019s not even a search.\u201d\n\nIllustration: Terry Shoffner\n\nNor is it always benign when judges take it on themselves to expand rights. \u201cDred Scott is for me the greatest example,\u201d Justice Gorsuch says. That 1857 ruling read the Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of \u201cdue process\u201d as including a right to own slaves in U.S. territories. \u201cThat is not in the Constitution,\u201d Justice Gorsuch says. \u201cNow, they thought they were doing it for a good reason. They thought it was really important so they could avoid a civil war.\u201d Needless to say, it didn\u2019t work.\n\nWhat about archaic practices that the Constitution might permit but are repugnant today? Justice Antonin Scalia once weighed what would happen if a state brought back flogging, saying he \u201cmay prove a faint-hearted originalist.\u201d Even if the First Congress, which proposed the Eighth Amendment, didn\u2019t consider it \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment, Scalia couldn\u2019t imagine upholding it. Later he reversed himself and called flogging \u201cstupid but constitutional.\u201d\n\nJustice Gorsuch declines to take his predecessor\u2019s bait. \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t thought much about flogging today,\u201d he deadpans, \u201cand I\u2019m not too worried about its recurrence at the moment. But I am not a faint-hearted originalist, and I don\u2019t think, in fairness to the old man, that he was either. I think he was being modest.\u201d\n\nAfter joining the court in 2017, Justice Gorsuch moved into Scalia\u2019s wood-paneled chambers. A portrait of James Madison hangs over a fireplace, and Leroy, a mounted elk from a Scalia hunting trip, keeps watch over the clerks. What surprised Justice Gorsuch most was how little had changed since his own clerkship, with Justice Anthony Kennedy, in 1993-94. He recalls a young Justice Clarence Thomas walking to the conference room. \u201cHe\u2019s dragging one of those library carts\u2014I\u2019ll show you one in a minute\u2014stacked with paper, because back then everything was paper,\u201d Justice Gorsuch says.\n\nFast forward two decades: \u201cI\u2019m walking out of my office for the first time to go to the conference room, and what do I see? Same man. Same library cart. Same stack of papers, because everything here is still done by paper. Nothing\u2019s changed.\u201d\n\nIn a few ways, however, Justice Gorsuch is a variation. A Denver native, he\u2019s the only member of the court born in a noncoastal state. He\u2019s the youngest justice, turned 52 last week. He may be the only Protestant. Although raised Catholic, he said in 2017 that he attends Episcopal services with his wife and two daughters.\n\nHe declines to clarify or to talk religion: \u201cPeople would view that as me tacitly admitting it has something to do with my day job, and I reject that.\u201d He\u2019ll say only that his faith is \u201ca great reservoir of strength for me. I need it, as a person. And I find faith in lots of places, but probably most of all in the cathedral of the Rocky Mountains. That\u2019s often where I feel closest to God.\u201d\n\nFor a judge, he writes in a conversational tone. Scalia avoided contractions, which he once called infra dignitatem\u2014beneath dignity. Justice Elena Kagan said in 2017 that she uses them only in dissents, where she feels able to \u201clet it go a little bit more.\u201d Justice Gorsuch doesn\u2019t hesitate to deploy them, starting in the first paragraph of his first majority opinion. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way I write,\u201d he says, perhaps a bit bewildered at the question. \u201cThere\u2019s no self-consciousness to it. I think good writing doesn\u2019t need to be legalese, doesn\u2019t need to be impenetrable\u2014that doesn\u2019t persuade me.\u201d But as for being colloquial: \u201cGood writing is more like what we speak than it is what lawyers sometimes aspire to.\u201d\n\nHe hasn\u2019t joined the court\u2019s \u201ccert. pool,\u201d through which most of the justices divide among their clerks the task of analyzing petitions for appeal. He\u2019s glad the pool exists\u2014a thorough process that creates a memo on each petition filed\u2014but also believes in having some eyes outside it. \u201cThere are 8,000 people a year who want this court to hear a case,\u201d he says. \u201cWe only hear about 70. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s asking too much of me to spend a little bit of time looking at those and doing it in-house, in our chambers, the old fashioned way.\u201d\n\nThe presupposition behind many questions during Neil Gorsuch's confirmation hearing on March 22, 2017, was that by taking the originalist approach, one hasn't evolved, and is stuck in 1788. Gorsuch disagrees. Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nAnother theme of his book is the separation of powers as a bulwark of liberty. People know the Bill of Rights, Justice Gorsuch says, but as with any contract, \u201cwhat makes it good is an enforcement mechanism, and that\u2019s what the separation of powers is\u2014it\u2019s our enforcement mechanism for these promises.\u201d\n\nThe Framers made it hard to pass legislation, so that laws \u201cwould be relatively few in number, clear, and the product of widespread social consensus.\u201d But that has led to a creeping encroachment on legislative power. When the executive branch effectively becomes a lawmaker, he argues, \u201cone of two things happens.\u201d Either \u201cyou elect a king,\u201d or \u201cthe king can\u2019t even control the people who do make the laws,\u201d in which case \u201cnobody controls them.\u201d\n\nTwo cases from the court\u2019s 2018-19 term illustrate the danger. In Gundy v. U.S., four of eight justices\u2014 Brett Kavanaugh wasn\u2019t confirmed in time for the argument\u2014expressed a willingness to apply greater scrutiny to Congress\u2019s delegations of power. At issue was a 2006 law authorizing prison time, up to 10 years, for sex offenders who failed to register. But for old convictions, Congress deputized the Justice Department to decide how the new rules would apply.\n\nThe law told the attorney general, in effect, \u201cYou go figure out the criminal legal liability of a half a million citizens of the United States,\u201d in Justice Gorsuch\u2019s words. \u201cThey happen to be unpopular citizens, and nobody is going to defend their conduct. But aren\u2019t they the canaries in the coal mine, is the question I\u2019ve raised.\u201d\n\nThe second case, Kisor v. Wilkie, involved judicial deference to administrative agencies. James Kisor asked the Department of Veterans Affairs for retroactive disability benefits. An internal administrative judge denied his claim. When he appealed, the VA initially prevailed thanks to precedents, notably 1997\u2019s Auer v. Robbins, that tell courts to defer to an agency\u2019s interpretations of its own ambiguous regulations. Five justices declined to overrule Auer but left it \u201czombified,\u201d as Justice Gorsuch put it in an animated opinion calling for it to be overturned outright.\n\nHe wonders why courts that have judicial power under the Constitution would defer like this to administrative judges. \u201cThey are employees of the executive branch interpreting their own rules in ways adverse to that veteran,\u201d he says, \u201cand then saying, \u2018Hey you, Mr. Article III Judge\u2014independent judge, nonpolitical judge, life-tenured judge, doesn\u2019t-care-what-people-think judge\u2014all right, you have to listen to my interpretation of the law, and you have to adhere to it, even if you think, independently, it\u2019s wrong.\u2019 \u201d\n\nA common reply to these critiques is that modern society is so complicated that citizen-legislators need the ability to delegate to experts. As Al Franken put it at Justice Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation hearing: \u201cWhat we senators don\u2019t want to be doing is deciding how much lead can be in your water, or what the distance in the slats are in a baby\u2019s crib.\u201d After the Gundy ruling this June, skeptics worried that the FDA might lose the authority to approve drugs.\n\nBut agencies existed long before the courts decided to defer to them, Justice Gorsuch says, \u201cand life seemed to work out OK.\u201d He regards the argument as a reductio ad absurdum: \u201cNobody is of the view that the government should come to a grinding\u2014I mean, that\u2019s silly, right\u2014a grinding halt,\u201d he says. \u201cOh, the world will end. . . . Nuclear war will follow next, right? Isn\u2019t that where these kind of arguments always lead? In high school debate, the end argument was \u2018Then nuclear war will follow.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOne twist is that Scalia spent years defending deference as a practical judicial restraint. \u201cEven Homer nodded,\u201d Justice Gorsuch says. \u201cJustice Thomas tells a wonderful story about sitting with Justice Scalia, and somehow Auer comes up,\u201d he recounts. \u201cScalia asks, \u2018Who wrote that terrible opinion?\u2019 And Justice Thomas says to Scalia, \u2018Well, you did, Nino.\u2019 \u201d\n\nJustice Gorsuch has a down-to-earth manner. He has talked about raising chickens, along with a goat named Nibbles, while his daughters were in 4-H back in Colorado. In one speech included in the book he says America has a judiciary of \u201chonest black polyester.\u201d When he joined the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, someone asked if he owned a robe. \u201cI was not born with a robe. I do not have a robe. Why would I have a robe?\u201d he says.\n\nA court staffer pointed him to a local uniform-supply shop. \u201cI\u2019m a frugal man,\u201d he says. \u201cThe standard choir outfit is a pretty good deal! So that\u2019s what I bought, and that\u2019s what I still use. It\u2019s a little worse for wear.\u201d One of the book\u2019s funniest lines comes on Judge Gorsuch\u2019s first day, when he trips while stepping up to the bench. \u201cNeil,\u201d his wife advises, \u201cyou have to lift your hem as you climb stairs.\u201d\n\nHe emphasizes the justices\u2019 camaraderie. Although the court takes only \u201cthe 70 hardest cases a year,\u201d it rules unanimously in about 40% of them. \u201cThat does not happen magically,\u201d Justice Gorsuch says. \u201cGet nine people to agree on where to go to lunch.\u201d He credits such consensus to \u201chard work, collegiality and mutual respect.\u201d\n\nWhen the justices meet in conference or to hear cases, they start with a round robin of 36 handshakes. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful gesture,\u201d Justice Gorsuch says. \u201cWe eat lunch together a lot. Justice [Stephen] Breyer comes in, it seems like, every day with a new knock-knock joke from his grandkids. We don\u2019t talk about business. We talk about family. We talk about life.\u201d\n\nThere are high jinks, too. When Justice Kavanaugh arrived, it fell to Justice Gorsuch, as the most junior colleague, to plan the welcome dinner. He took a risk in lining up the entertainment. You know those giant foam heads of presidents that footrace during Washington Nationals baseball games? \u201cI hired two of them,\u201d he says, dropping to a giddy whisper, \u201cand they had a race in the Great Hall of the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d\n\nWhich two? \u201cI think we had Washington and Jefferson,\u201d he says. \u201cWashington won, and the chief justice had the checkered flag. And I confess, I didn\u2019t tell anybody because I thought it might be better to ask for forgiveness than permission on this one, and I wasn\u2019t sure how it was going to go.\u201d Well? \u201cIt was a huge hit, because we of course have a lot of baseball fans on the court.\u201d\n\nMr. Peterson is a member of the Journal\u2019s editorial board.", "description": "Justice Neil Gorsuch discusses his new book, the dangers of the administrative state, and why the Constitution\u2019s meaning never changes.", "authors": ["Kyle Peterson"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/ED-AY943_WINTER_SOC_20190904113644.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
