They didn\u2019t help us in Normandy.\"\n\nAD\n\nThose comments confused some observers, who saw the Kurdish role in World War II as irrelevant to the U.S. position on their alliance today. Washington certainly doesn\u2019t shape all of its modern alliances on where a country stood in World War II \u2014 with Germany and Japan being the obvious examples.\n\nAD\n\nAnd the Kurds do not even have their own nation-state, living instead largely between Syria, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Armenia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a weird framing that doesn\u2019t really make sense historically or politically,\u201d said Djene Rhys Bajalan, an assistant professor of Middle Eastern history at Missouri State University whose research focuses on Kurds at the end of World War I. \u201cNumerous people who didn\u2019t have nation-states weren\u2019t necessarily at Normandy but participated either directly in the war or in terms of providing materials and labor for the war.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSome Kurdish fighters were among them. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have a state, so they couldn\u2019t act as a state,\u201d said Jordi Tejel, a professor of history at the University of Neuch\u00e2tel in Switzerland and author of \u201cSyria\u2019s Kurds: History, Politics and Society.\u201d Still, he said individual Kurdish fighters from across the region did join other armies, fighting alongside the British and the Soviet Union\u2019s Red Army.\n\nAD\n\nThere were Kurds who sympathized with the Nazis, seeing them as an anti-colonial alternative to the British or French, Tejel said. But others went to great lengths to counter Nazi influence in the Middle East.\n\nIn 1941, pro-Nazi Iraqi army generals helped launch a coup d\u2019etat, installing Arab nationalist Rashid Ali al-Gaylani as the new prime minister. And it was the Kurds who \"played a disproportionately large role in [later] overthrowing that military junta,\u201d Bajalan said.\n\nAD\n\nThe #Kurds DID fight on the Allied side in WW2.\n\nThey helped break the siege following the 1941 pro-Nazi Coup d'\u00e9tat in Iraq & were part of the (pro-Allied) Iraq Levies. By 1942 Kurds made up 25% of the force. By 1943, 10 of the 44 companies comprising the Iraq Levies were Kurdish https://t.co/ggoP22XRbW \u2014 Akil N Awan (@Akil_N_Awan) October 10, 2019\n\nIn more recent history, Bajalan said, Kurds have pursued friendlier ties with the United States than other groups in the region and \u201cprovided the bulk of manpower for the northern front in 2003 during the Iraq War.\u201d\n\nThe Kurdish fighters now facing the Turkish offensive belong to the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces, a group formed in 2015 to fight the Islamic State. The SDF was created out of a coalition of Kurdish fighters from the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) and Arab groups.\n\nAD\n\nThe United States threw its support behind the force, seeing it as crucial in defeating the Islamic State. But Turkey sees the group as a terrorist organization linked to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which has launched attacks inside Turkey in recent years.\n\nAD\n\nThis week, the SDF\u2019s official Twitter account said 11,000 of its members have been killed in the past five years.\n\n\u201cThere were assurances from the United States of America that it would not allow any Turkish military operations against the region,\u201d Kino Gabriel, a spokesman for the SDF, told al-Hadath TV this week. He went on to describe the U.S. decision to step aside as \u201ca stab in the back.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nAD", "description": "But they didn't have a country, so they couldn't fight as one.", "authors": ["Siobh\u00e1n O'Grady", "Staff Writer", "Foreign Desk"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AZYXN_gzd6YTvQTdZmPJEv6z8MA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XVRP4ZHLOMI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
