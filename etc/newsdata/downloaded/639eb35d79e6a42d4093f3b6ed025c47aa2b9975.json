Tehran denies any role. The strikes were claimed by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi forces.\n\nRouhani said ties between Iran and the United Arab Emirates, part of a Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen, had improved and \"officials have visited each others countries\".\n\nThe United Arab Emirates, though a prominent foe of Iran in the Middle East\u2019s power struggles, has not assigned blame to anyone for the attacks on oil infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"MAXIMUM PRESSURE\"\n\nRouhani, restating Iran's stance, said Tehran will continue to reduce its nuclear commitments until European parties to the pact save it by protecting Iran's economy from U.S. penalties.\n\nIran has responded to U.S. \"maximum pressure\" by scaling back commitments since May and threatened to continue removing curbs on its nuclear program unless European parties to the pact did more to shield Iran\u2019s economy from the U.S. penalties.\n\nBritain, France and Germany, all parties to the pact, have urged Iran to refrain from any concrete act breaching the pact.\n\n\"The European countries have failed to fulfill their promises. We will continue to decrease our nuclear commitments,\" Rouhani said. \"We will start working on IR-7 and IR-9 centrifuges.\"\n\nUnder the deal, Iran is allowed limited research and development on advanced centrifuges, which accelerate the production of fissile material that can be used to make a nuclear bomb. Iran also agreed to limitations on specific research and development activities for eight years.\n\nRouhani said an Iranian tanker, the Sabiti, damaged in the Red Sea on Friday had been hit by at least two rockets, and adding that the incident had been caught on video. There has been no independent report on the cause of the damage.\n\nIran's rival Saudi Arabia has said it was not behind any attack on the tanker. Saudi authorities said they received a distress message from the vessel, but they added that it had switched off its transponder before they could assist.\n\nRouhani, speaking live on state television on Monday, said the attack was undoubtedly carried out by a government and that there would be consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Writing by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by Alison Williams, William Maclean)", "description": "Iran on Monday urged regional powers to use diplomacy to reduce tensions including Yemen's war, but cautioned that an Iranian tanker damaged in the Red Sea last week had been hit by rockets and there would have to be consequences.
