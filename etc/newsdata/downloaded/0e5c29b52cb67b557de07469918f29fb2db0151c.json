She has just started secondary school, and aside from the stress of making new friends, starting new classes and becoming a teenager, she is contending with the realities of living in a converted office block, which means sharing a bedroom with her mum.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no space for her to do her homework,\u201d says her mother, Audrey Newman, sitting in the room that serves as their kitchen, lounge and dining room. \u201cShe\u2019s going to need her own room. She can\u2019t still be sharing a room with me when she\u2019s 15, 16. That\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d\n\nThe family, including Helen\u2019s 13-year-old brother, is one of many living in Connect House, a block of former offices in the middle of an industrial estate across the road from a waste tip in Croydon.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nUntil several weeks ago, the building was being used by local councils to house homeless families temporarily while they found them something more permanent. The cramped conditions and industrial surroundings had prompted anger, but residents knew there was an end in sight.\n\nNow it has emerged that local authorities are moving families into private rented flats in the block as a permanent solution to their housing needs. This sort of arrangement, known as a \u201cprivate rented sector offer\u201d, lasts at least one year and allows councils to fulfil their main housing duty \u2013 meaning they can remove families from the homelessness list.\n\nResidents of Connect House would have had to agree to move there under these arrangements, but they say it was because there was no other viable option. Now they say they feel \u201dtrapped\u201d, no longer considered homeless, but unable to call the converted office block a home.\n\nTheir plight stems from the wider housing crisis facing the country, which has led to more than 8 million people across England currently living in unaffordable, insecure or unsuitable homes.\n\nA toxic combination of rising rents, controversial welfare reforms and a severe shortage of affordable homes has seen soaring numbers of families simply unable to afford to house themselves. They are left at the whim of cash-strapped councils to find them somewhere to live.\n\nAudrey, 50, who was born in west London, says she reported being homeless to Hammersmith and Fulham Council, and was given the option of either moving to Luton or into Connect House through the local authority\u2019s direct lettings scheme.\n\n\u201cIt was an easy decision because I said I wasn\u2019t moving to Luton, I would have been too far from my family,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut now it feels like we\u2019ve been put here and that\u2019s it, no one wants to help us. We\u2019re out of sight, out of mind. That\u2019s how I feel.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

She had reported to Sutton Council as homeless in June 2018, and was given an offer to move into a private rented flat in Connect House. Out of desperation and with no better option, she took the offer.\n\nShe quickly regretted it after discovering that there were silverfish insects in the flat, as well as a growing mould and damp problem. She also feels the environment is unsuitable for her child, but because the council discharged their duty on her case, she feels that now there is no way out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been stopped outside with my daughter and asked if I want to buy drugs. She\u2019s just done her year two exams. It\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare. These silverfish have got massive now, and nothing has been done. I was crying my eyes out about it last week.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m stuck here now. If I move out, I\u2019ll become intentionally homeless. I can\u2019t do that. My little girl can\u2019t be homeless again. So I can\u2019t get out of here. I\u2019m trapped.\u201d\n\nRoxanne, who used to work in a care home and is hoping to go back to work soon, said it would be \u201cphysically impossible\u201d for her to rent another property due to the cost of a deposit and paying a month\u2019s rent in advance.\n\n\u201cHow am I ever going to save to get out of here? The government are putting us in a hole and no one is helping us to get out.\u201d\n\nAmong those in Connect House is a refugee couple who was moved into the block in May, just weeks after being granted asylum. The man and woman, who did not want to be named or for their country of origin to be reported, are living in one room together.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful for this country, and the government here. They have helped us. We feel grateful that at least we\u2019re okay,\u201d says the man. \u201cBut there\u2019s not much room here. I haven\u2019t been able to bring any friends over. I feel ashamed of having someone walk in.\n\n\u201cWhen I left I had a beautiful home, but I was forced out of the country. It hasn\u2019t been easy. We\u2019ve been going from one accommodation to the next. We keep our luggage packed because we don\u2019t want to be here ... we just want a fresh start. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nLocal MP Siobhain McDonagh says the building has been a concern for more than a year \u2013 but in recent weeks, a number of councils have been using it to discharge their duty to homeless families instead of considering it temporary accommodation.\n\n\u201cSome families think they\u2019re here temporarily, but in fact this is their permanent home,\u201d she says. \u201cNo matter how long temporary is, I think if something is temporary you can try and put up with it, but it\u2019s pretty bleak if you think this is your permanent accommodation.\n\n\u201cPeople are here with their kids, their kids may have special needs, health problems. You have to walk through an industrial estate.\u201d\n\nMs McDonagh said the situation stemmed from a change to planning laws in 2013 which enabled developers to change the use of buildings from offices to residential without the need for planning permission, coupled with the \u201ccomplete crisis\u201d in the number of social housing units available.\n\nHomeless charity Shelter warned that this type of arrangement was cropping up across the country as the housing crisis worsened. Chief executive Polly Neate said it was \u201cmodern-day \u2018slum\u2019 housing\u201d, adding: \u201cShoddy old office blocks are no place for any family to live. It should never be ok for children to grow up in cramped, or worse dangerous, flats in the middle of industrial parks with no safe space to play.\u201d\n\nSouth West London Estate, which recently bought Connect House, said it was aware of the problems facing households living in the block, and that it was \u201ctrying to be proactive\u201d at identifying issues and working to resolve them. A spokesperson said they were doing what they could to improve the situation but added: \u201cYou have to ask the councils why they have put a family of five in a two-bedroom flat.\u201d\n\nSutton Council said it does not manage services at Connect House and denied that it used the block to discharge its homelessness duties, adding that tenants were living there \u201cthrough their own choice\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Hammersmith and Fulham Council said it was \u201chugely frustrated\u201d by a number of government policies affecting their ability to house people. They said the Right To Buy scheme was taking properties off the rented market, and universal credit was having a negative impact on those who need housing as well as making it difficult to attract landlords. The government, on the other hand, claims councils have been given \u201ca range of powers\u201d to ensure privately rented homes meet standards.\n\nWhile authorities argue over who is to blame, for Roxanne and daughter Demi-Leigh, there is no end in sight. \u201cAt least people in temporary accommodation get moved out,\u201d said Roxanne. \u201cI\u2019m left here to rot. I\u2019m stuck.\u201d", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a tight squeeze,\u201d says Helen, 12, gesturing towards a small room where almost all of the floor space is taken up by\u00a0two beds and a wardrobe.
