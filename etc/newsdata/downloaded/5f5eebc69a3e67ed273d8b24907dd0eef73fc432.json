That would negate the whole point of his pivot into politics. It wasn\u2019t to promote ideas; it was to promote himself. Health permitting, he\u2019ll move heaven and earth to maintain his omnipresence in American life, by which I mean he\u2019ll be as outrageous as he must to stay in the news. And we in the media will confront a decision: Give him what he wants, or let go of him and all the eyeballs he draws?\n\nEven if we let go, there\u2019s the strong possibility, as Coppins noted, that he\u2019ll establish his own media enterprise, with a network where the news really is fake, adulation doesn\u2019t hinge on nuisances like the ballot box and Sean Hannity isn\u2019t the model for Trump veneration. He\u2019s the baseline.\n\nFrom that coddled perch Trump can take out his big black Sharpie and write higher vote counts over his actual, official ones. He can draw horns on John Bolton and a halo over William Barr. He can sketch a second White House adjacent to the first one but taller, with gold trim.", "description": "", "authors": ["Frank Bruni", "Msn.Com En-Us News Opinion We-Will-Never-Ever-Be-Rid-Of-Donald-Trump"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
