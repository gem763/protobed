But during her first Senate campaign in 2012, she and her aides were pressed on single-payer and dodged the question again and again, according to an analysis of newspaper reports, TV, and interviews with health care reform activists at the time.\n\n\u201cIt was frustrating,\u201d Ture Turnbull, former executive director of Mass-Care, a single-payer advocacy group in Warren\u2019s home state of Massachusetts, said of her comments in the 2012 race. \"There were multiple times where we would approach her, and that was the standard response.\u201d\n\nWarren's refusal to embrace single-payer during that campaign came four years after she co-wrote an essay that called it the \"most obvious\" solution to the nation's health care woes \u2014 though perhaps \"politically unacceptable.\"\n\nWarren\u2019s remarks in 2012, as well as her more circumspect attitude toward Medicare for All at the beginning of her presidential campaign, has exposed her to criticisms from the left. That could become a liability, particularly if her progressive rival Bernie Sanders contrasts it with his decades-long support for single-payer. The two candidates have agreed to a non-aggression pact, but as Warren has risen in the polls, Sanders and his aides have begun to highlight differences between the candidates.\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO, Sanders said no other presidential contender would prioritize single-payer as much as him. \u201cI'm glad that we have other people, in various forms, supporting it. I've been on this issue for I don't know how many years \u2014 20, 30 years, okay?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been my passion. I believe from the bottom of my heart that healthcare is a human right.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s record on Medicare for All has drawn scrutiny from some single-payer advocates. Many activists trust that she is fully on board with the policy and would push for it in the White House as strongly as Sanders, according to a survey of nearly 20 people and organizations that support Medicare for All. But some, including even Warren\u2019s allies, are less certain.\n\n\u201cWe know that if Elizabeth Warren is elected president, we\u2019re going to have to work hard to make sure she prioritizes it appropriately,\" said Sal Rosselli, president of the National Union of Healthcare Workers, which has endorsed both Sanders and Warren. \"We know that Bernie Sanders will because of history.\"\n\nWarren\u2019s embrace of Medicare for All in 2020 has proven pivotal. It has won her admiration from progressives who see it as a litmus test, and fueled attacks from moderates who say it makes her \u201cunelectable.\u201d It also appears to have helped her chip away at Sanders\u2019 base: A recent poll of the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire found that more voters who approve of single-payer back Warren than Sanders.\n\nWarren's previous hesitance toward Medicare for All could give Sanders' supporters, if not Sanders himself, an opening to attack her as less than authentic. Some of his fans already have gone there on social media. Health care is also a top concern for Democratic voters, and single-payer is fairly popular within the party, particularly among the progressives who are a key part of Warren's coalition.\n\n\u201cElizabeth believes Medicare for All should be the law of the land. She has made the case for why consistently and passionately,\u201d said Saloni Sharma, Warren\u2019s national deputy press secretary. \u201cShe spent her whole career studying why families go broke, and came to find that one of the top reasons for personal bankruptcies is health crises and medical expenses \u2014 even for families with insurance.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s aides did not provide a comment on her remarks during her 2012 campaign. It was a vastly different time politically: The \u201cpublic option,\u201d now seen as the compromise position of Joe Biden, was considered far-left. Fierce backlash against the Affordable Care Act had helped Republicans pick up 63 House seats two years earlier. Brown had won office promising to oppose the bill.\n\nElizabeth Warren celebrates with her husband, Bruce Mann, after winning her Senate race in November 2012. | Michael Dwyer/AP Photo\n\nIn 2012, Brown tried to paint Warren as a radical who\u2019d usher in European-style, government-run health care. Warren also had a primary opponent, Marisa DeFranco, who called herself the \"only candidate in this race who supports single-payer\" and chastised Warren for not doing so.\n\nWarren and her staff repeatedly tried to steer questions about single-payer back to the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI think the urgent question now is whether we're going to be able to hold on to the health care reforms that just passed,\" Warren said in one typical statement that year. \"There are a lot of people who want to repeal them. I think we need to focus on protecting them and on finding new ways to lower costs, which are still too high.\u201d\n\nIn another example, Warren's 2012 spokeswoman said \"Elizabeth supports the [ACA]\" when asked for her position on single-payer.\n\nBraude, the TV host, tried but failed to push Warren off her talking points. \u201cYou do support single-payer, do you not?\u201d he asked. Warren replied, \u201cNo, what I\u2019ve got right now \u2026 \u201d at which point he interrupted her and countered that she had expressed support for single-payer in the past. She shot back, \u201cOh! I think you need to go back and take a look.\u201d\n\nAsked this March by CNN's Jake Tapper whether she backed eliminating commercial insurance, Warren said Sanders' Medicare for All bill, which she signed onto in 2017, has \"a runway for that,\" adding later, \"I've also co-sponsored other bills.\" More recently she's come under fire for referring to Medicare for All as a \"framework,\" though she reiterated her support for the plan in the same remarks.\n\nDying activist Ady Barkan, one of the nation\u2019s most high-profile advocates for Medicare for All, interviewed Warren about single-payer in a video released last month. In the Q&A, he said health care reformers had criticized her at the beginning of her campaign for not talking about Medicare for All or being clear about her stance on abolishing private insurance.\n\nBarkan asked Warren in the interview if she was initially hesitant at the outset because, in his view, her approach to dealing with problems generally is \"not to dramatically expand the size of the public sector, but to instead heavily regulate private-sector actors and beat down their greed.\u201d Warren said \"no,\" adding, \u201cI think it was more about focused on transition than on endpoint. But there are areas where markets just don't work, and a big part of health care is one of those.\u201d\n\nBarkan told POLITICO that Sanders deserves \"tremendous\" credit for rallying for Medicare for All when it wasn\u2019t popular, but aside from that, \u201cthere\u2019s really no daylight\u201d between the two candidates on the topic \u2014 and they would both make it a top priority in the White House.\n\n\u201cThe country thought Medicare for All was a fringe idea back then,\u201d he said of Warren\u2019s comments in 2012. \u201cIt was an entirely different context from now, when we have a majority of Americans getting behind single-payer health care.\u201d\n\nSingle-payer advocates appear split on how significant Warren's earlier reticence is.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the leading sponsor of the House\u2019s single-payer bill who has not yet endorsed a candidate.\n\nBut others predicted Sanders would make it more of a focus than Warren or that there are other distinctions between the candidates on the issue. Single-payer supporters who have endorsed Sanders, in particular, are skeptical.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s an Elizabeth-come-lately,\u201d said Peter Knowlton, general president of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, which is backing the Vermont senator.\n\nIt's unclear if Sanders will draw stronger contrasts with Warren on Medicare for All. For months he went out of his way not to criticize Warren, whom he considers a friend, but last week he went further than ever in explaining how he differs from her.\n\n\"Bernie wrote the bill,\" said Megan Svoboda, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America's national political committee. \"It\u2019s been his priority for years, and he ran on Medicare For All in 2016. There\u2019s no question that it will be a Day One priority for him. Warren, on the other hand, hasn\u2019t prioritized it in her campaign and therefore likely wouldn\u2019t as president.\"", "description": "", "authors": ["Alice Miranda Ollstein", "Joanne Kenen"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/63/28/a6d083704dd8aab964fe32012d9d/191011-elizabeth-warren-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
