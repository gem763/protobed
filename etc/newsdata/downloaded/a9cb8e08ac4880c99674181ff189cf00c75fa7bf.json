This week, we\u2019re going behind the scenes at Lifehacker. I\u2019m Tim Mulkerin, and this is how I work.\n\nName: Tim Mulkerin Location: New York, NY Current gig: Social media editor, Lifehacker Current computer: MacBook Pro Current mobile device: iPhone XS One word that best describes how you work: Sponge-ily\n\nFirst of all, tell us a little about your background and how you got to where you are today.\n\nI got my start in media a couple of years out of college. I studied art history and considered going to grad school for museum studies, but quickly realised how burned out I was on school. I was ready to work. So I started writing for a few small sites and then eventually got an internship as a writer for Business Insider. From there, I got a full-time gig as a staff writer\u2014and then a social editor\u2014at Mic. (May she rest in peace.)\n\nA fun aside: After my last day of work at Mic\u2014the place I left to join Lifehacker\u2014a few coworkers joined me for going-away drinks at a bar near the office. While we were there, news broke that Bustle was buying Mic, and the tone of the room shifted, uh, shall we say, dramatically. Less than 24 hours later, all the (likely very hungover, as was I) people who were at my going-away drinks had been laid off. Fellow media folks (and everyone, really): Unionize your fucking workplace.\n\nWhat are your job responsibilities?\n\nI manage the day-to-day posting for Lifehacker\u2019s Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. (Like and subscribe!) That includes writing a post\u2019s share text, reformatting images if necessary, doing some light image editing in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, making stupid memes, and generally acting like a dumbass online. An endearing one, hopefully.\n\nI handle most of our posting using SocialFlow, which lets me post to multiple accounts through a single portal and get a quick understanding of how our traffic\u2019s doing that day compared to others. I also edit the layout of our daily newsletter and pitch Lifehacker articles to third-party syndicators as a way to round out our traffic and reach new readers. When I have time, I exploit my past as a Starbucks barista for the clicks and organise Q&As with experts working in topics that Lifehacker covers.\n\nPhoto: Tim Mulkerin\n\nWhat\u2019s your workspace setup like?\n\nI have an adjustable standing desk with a dual-monitor setup. I spend most of my time sitting, but in the afternoons I tend to get squirmy and stand up for a bit. My MacBook Pro sits on my right and the second monitor\u2019s on my left. In between my monitors, I have my most prized possession: a teeny-tiny area rug I got from The Met gift shop. It\u2019s technically a mousepad, but it sucks at being a mousepad. I use it as a coaster for my drinks. The only picture I have on my desk is a boudoir shot of Winnie, my best friend\u2019s dog who is also my goddaughter.\n\nTake us through a recent workday.\n\nI usually get to the office between 9 and 9:30, depending on the mood the subway\u2019s in that day. By that time, at least one story has probably gone up on the site, so I\u2019ll quickly schedule a tweet and a Facebook post for it as soon as I get in. (If I\u2019m running late, I can do this from my phone on the subway or as I dodge Times Square tourists and people dressed as Megatron.)\n\nOnce I\u2019m situated at my desk with a hefty cuppa cold brew, I spend a chunk of the morning checking emails, scrolling through our Twitter mentions, and moderating Facebook comments from overnight to make sure nothing horrific has unfolded that needs dealing with. Banning someone from our Facebook page for saying something wildly bigoted or for harassing other readers is something that happens with depressing frequency.\n\nBy about 10, I can get into the core of my job: promoting Lifehacker\u2019s work on our various social channels. For every story on the site, I post two tweets (one when the story goes live and another later that night), usually a Facebook post, and less often, a blurb on Instagram. We publish about 20 stories per day, so that keeps me pretty busy. I have to read every story before I promote it, because there\u2019s often an interesting nugget or quote in the story that didn\u2019t make the on-page headline, but that offers a perfect little teaser for a tweet or Facebook caption.\n\nIf you fuck up, readers will let you know. Believe me.\ufeff\n\nIf our video team has anything publishing on the site that day, I\u2019ll spend a little time packaging it for our social channel. Otherwise, in the downtime between scheduling posts for Twitter and Facebook, I can work on various long-term and lower-urgency projects. I\u2019ll check my Instagram plan for the week and see if I have to whip up an image for that. Also, all the G/O Media sites can share each other\u2019s articles on social, so the other social editors and I drop links in a Slack channel throughout the day with stories we think would fit on each other\u2019s feeds.\n\nAt 12, I check on our daily Lifehacker newsletter and make sure all the stories that have been pulled automatically make sense for that format. The post that\u2019s been selected as the lead story by algorithm magic isn\u2019t always a great choice, so I\u2019ll go in and swap it out for something a little heftier and on-brand. This is all a relatively new process for the social team, so I\u2019m having fun experimenting\u2014and eventually, I\u2019ll A/B test a few different components to refine the format and see what our audience likes.\n\nLifehacker typically publishes its last story at 5:30 or 6, so I try to leave the office a little after 5 and schedule the last post of the day from my phone while I\u2019m at the gym or commuting home. Nothing depresses me more than getting home late at night once the sun\u2019s gone down, so if I can get to the office early and scoot out a little early and do some remote work, I\u2019m a happy boy.\n\nOf course, I have pre-scheduled tweets and Facebook posts going up long after I leave the office, so I usually check our comments and Twitter mentions a couple times throughout the evening to make sure I didn\u2019t post the wrong link in a tweet or make a typo. If you fuck up, readers will let you know. Believe me.\n\nWhat apps, gadgets, or tools can\u2019t you live without?\n\nSpotify\n\nSlack\n\nGIPHY Capture\n\nTitleCase\n\nChartbeat\n\nSocialFlow\n\nNoisli\n\nJabra Elite 65t bluetooth headphones\n\nNintendo Switch\n\nPS4\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite shortcut or hack?\n\nIt\u2019s probably too basic, but AirDrop changed my goddamn life.\n\nTake us through an interesting, unusual, or finicky process you have in place at work.\n\nThe typical format we use for a tweet includes share text, a shortened link, and the header image. To tweet out that image, I have to save it to my desktop from the article, resize it to SocialFlow\u2019s liking, then drag-and-drop it into SocialFlow. This means I have million stock photos saved to my desktop with names like \u201csoup,\u201d \u201ckids,\u201d \u201cvivaldi,\u201d \u201cfreebies,\u201d \u201carse,\u201d and \u201cbig pickles.\u201d (Those names, for me, are much easier to find than whatever word salad our site spits out as the default file name.) I hate clutter, so deleting them all en masse (20 articles per day = about 100 images per week) is such a great feeling.\n\nHow do you keep track of what you have to do?\n\nWe have a bot that posts every story we publish into a special Slack channel. When I\u2019ve scheduled a post for social, I note that I\u2019ve done so by \u201creacting\u201d to the post with the blond-boy-sitting-at-a-laptop emoji. A very sophisticated system.\n\nI also use Slackbot\u2019s reminder system\u2014you just type \u201cremind me to [whatever task] at [whatever time]\u201d\u2014on the daily. \u201cRemind me to post the job interview video at 10 am on Wednesday.\u201d Stuff like that. And, of course, I usually have a few sticky note reminders with various levels of sun damage affixed to the bottom of my computer screen.\n\nHow do you recharge or take a break?\n\nI like to look out the giant window by my desk and watch all the people walking down on the footpath. If it\u2019s nice out, I\u2019ll go for a walk around the block or buy something carb-y at a coffee shop. If outside is bad, I\u2019ll watch a Vine compilation or this video of people singing Robyn on a subway platform.\n\nWhat are you currently reading, or what do you recommend?\n\nI\u2019m currently reading Red, White and Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston. Here are my favourite books I\u2019ve read in the last year or so:\n\nCan you share a music playlist you\u2019ve made, whether for working or elsewhere?\n\nI\u2019ve never been great at making my own playlists, so I usually rely on friends and Spotify\u2019s pre-made ones, like:\n\nWho else would you like to see answer these questions?\n\nJohn Mulaney. Ali Wong.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best advice you\u2019ve ever received?\n\nYou do not work at the CIA. You are a human first and an employee second.\n\nWhat\u2019s a problem you\u2019re still trying to solve?\n\nHow to convince Mark Zuckerberg to give me a billion doll hairs.", "description": "Every week, we share the shortcuts, workspaces, and productivity tips of our favourite experts.
