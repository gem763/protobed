The SDK is meant to address this evolving landscape, while keeping security in focus.\n\nNok Nok Labs is one of the founding members of the FIDO (aka Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, an open industry association started in 2013 with an aim to develop secure authentication standards to solve the over-reliance on passwords.\n\nThe company already offers an app called Passport that uses your smartphone or smart watch as an authenticator for apps that leverage its backend for logging into websites on other platforms. With this SDK, the watch will function both as the client and the authenticator.\n\nBasically, this means that when logging to a service on your watch, the SDK will directly verify your identity without having to resort to a dedicated two-factor authentication mechanism. However, this will work only if the service in question uses Nok Nok\u2019s authentication solution.\n\nCredit: Nok Nok Labs Apple\u2019s new watchOS update decouples the phone from the watch\n\n\u201cThe ability to access sensitive information via a smart watch necessitates a more secure method of authentication that integrates with existing backend security infrastructures,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe development comes as global smart watch shipments grew 44 percent year over year to hit 12 million units in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nNok Nok Labs is also working with the Liechtenstein government in implementing a new electronic ID (called eID) solution that leverages the FIDO standard to create a secure and easy to use digital identity for its citizens.\n\nWith a flurry of identity-focused solutions in recent months coming from Google, Microsoft, and Apple, it\u2019s safe to say passwords are well on their way to well-deserved slow-but-eventual death.", "description": "Authentication solutions provider Nok Nok Labs has officially announced the availability of FIDO-based passwordless authentication for smart watches.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fapple-watch-hed.jpg&signature=4255bc3256791b1b51da6eb2c5fac2d9", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
