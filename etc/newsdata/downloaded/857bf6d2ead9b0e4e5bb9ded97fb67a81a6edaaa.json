The EPA's website states that such a notice does not mean the agency conclusively believes a violation has taken place.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The public health department retrieved 164,264 needles in August 2018 alone via a longstanding disposal programme and street cleanups, the New York Times reported.\n\nMs Reed said the city was providing 1,000 new shelter beds, is working to create a $600m affordable housing bond, and is increasing mental health and drug services. California\u2019s governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s June budget announced spending of around $2.75bn in efforts to address homelessness in the state.\n\nMr Trump, who visited the city for the first time in his tenure this week, has frequently criticised San Francisco and its congresswoman Nancy Pelosi over the rise in homelessness.\n\n\u201cSpeaking of failing badly, has anyone seen what is happening to Nancy Pelosi\u2019s district in San Francisco,\u201d he wrote on Twitter in July. \u201dIt is not even recognisable lately. Something must be done before it is too late. The Dems should stop wasting time on the witch hunt hoax and start focusing on our country.\u201d\n\nOpponents allege that Mr Trump\u2019s criticisms are part of a concerted effort to paint Democrat-governed cities, such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Baltimore, Chicago and New York, as crime-ridden ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nIn response to Mr Trump\u2019s Wednesday allegations, San Francisco senator Scott Wiener branded him \u201ca slumlord\u201d, and accused him of pushing people into homelessness by stripping health care, food assistance and affordable housing funds.\n\nHe called the accusations part of Mr Trump\u2019s \u201clet\u2019s slander the cities campaign\u201d, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\n\n\u201cI wish Trump would have his EPA enforce against actual environmental problems, but I guess that would be too much to ask,\u201d Mr Wiener wrote on Twitter.\n\nOn 12 September, Mr Trump announced he would repeal the clean water act, taking power away from the EPA in the 22 states in which the law was in effect.\n\nThe bill was created to limit pollution in a majority of US waterways, protecting about a third of the country's drinking water. With its repeal, farmers will no longer need a permit to use chemical pesticides and fertilisers in areas that could contaminate such waterways, the New York Times reported.\n\nThe EPA is expected to issue a new law protecting the country's waterways later this year, but after reported lobbying from agricultural groups it is expected to provide less stringent protections than the legislation being repealed.", "description": "Donald Trump has vowed to issue the city of San Francisco with an environmental violation, claiming the city\u2019s sewer system is polluting the ocean with used needles and other waste.
