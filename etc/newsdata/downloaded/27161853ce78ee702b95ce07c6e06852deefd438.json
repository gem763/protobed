Lee Zeldin (NY) as nothing more than a \u201cclown show\u201d process, it would seem fitting that the choice of venue for the interviews was \u2026 the state fair.\n\nBefore we get started on what the voters said, let\u2019s take a quick look at the beauty of it all \u2013 from the ferris wheel at sunset to the bacon stand where, of course, the bacon options are plentiful:\n\nBlue hour at the North Carolina State Fair, we\u2019re talkin\u2019 impeachment with fairgoers and getting an earful. My report at 7:40p on CNN. pic.twitter.com/Yjwq9KFuLW \u2014 Martin Savidge (@MartinSavidge) October 24, 2019\n\nBacon may rule on the midway. But we\u2019ve come to the NC state fair to sample the appetite for impeachment. pic.twitter.com/wLL1wmL9uu \u2014 Martin Savidge (@MartinSavidge) October 24, 2019\n\nMost of the voters Savidge talked to were either against impeaching Trump or ambivalent about it. One of the voters talked about how he did not like the secrecy of it all. Here\u2019s a partial transcript:\n\nSAVIDGE: Here, you can satisfy your wildest deep-fried dreams. We\u2019ve come to measure voter appetite for impeachment.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it\u2019s a waste of the taxpayer\u2019s money.\n\n\n\nSAVIDGE: Do you think the president did anything wrong?\n\n\n\nJENNIFER WALL, NORTH CAROLINA VOTER: Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nJIM UZZLE, NORTH CAROLINA VOTER: I don\u2019t think he\u2019s broken the law and I wish they would do right for America versus wasting their money, our money on a lost cause.\n\n\n\nSAVIDGE: Most of the Trump supporters we talked to were unmoved by days of explosive testimony and revelations against the president.\n\n\n\nDo you think it changes the minds of Trump supporters?\n\n\n\nJEFF MASON, NORTH CAROLINA VOTER: I do not. The ones of us who support him will continue to support him. If you look at the economy, there\u2019s no way to design that weir doing pretty amazing.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nRICH BLEWITT, NORTH CAROLINA VOTER: If it was out in the open and everything was discussed and he did something wrong, impeach the guy. I just don\u2019t like the secrecy. It just sounds wrong the way they\u2019re going about it, that\u2019s all.\n\nIt was the last voter, a Trump supporter, who stole the segment. When Savidge asked him if he followed the impeachment news closely, here\u2019s how the voter answered:\n\nSAVIDGE: Joe Miller did vote for Trump. Do you follow this?\n\n\n\nJOE MILLER, NORTH CAROLINA VOTER: Not much. I try not to, actually.\n\n\n\nSAVIDGE: How do you avoid it? It seems to be everywhere.\n\n\n\nMILLER: I watch a lot of ESPN.\n\nHeh. I set the video to start at his comments. Click below to watch:\n\nNow my critics will complain that I\u2019m saying voters should stay in the dark on what\u2019s going on in the world by avoiding watching the news. Not so. I just know that as someone who covers this stuff every day, sometimes it\u2019s nice to be able to avoid all the drama and spin, even if just for a few hours. Especially when we\u2019re talking about watching the type of \u201cnews\u201d programming that comes from national media outlets like CNN.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not even so much by watching ESPN as an alternative, either, because even they get political sometimes. Maybe watch some ID channel. Or HGTV, or some YouTube organizing videos, or \u2026\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\n\u2014 Based in North Carolina, Sister Toldjah is a former liberal and a 16+ year veteran of blogging with an emphasis on media bias, social issues, and the culture wars.
