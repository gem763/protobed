Foreign direct investment flows into members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations exceeded those into China in 2018 for the first time since 1993.\n\nWhile China's exports to the US are suffering, shipments to the US have picked up from Vietnam, Bangladesh, Taiwan and South Korea. However, not everyone has been a winner: imports from Malaysia and Indonesia are down this year.\n\nBut as highlighted by HSBC's Asia economics team, many markets have seen an overall fall in shipments because of slower growth in China, which in turn reflects the impact of the trade war and slower domestic demand within the world's number two economy.\n\nAnd this speaks to a point that is of fundamental importance to Australian investors: the emergence of China as a driver of Asia's growth.\n\nAs highlighted by HSBC, China looms as a much more significant driver of growth than either the US or Europe for Asia Pacific's developing and developed economies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina's growth has slowed and those investors hoping for an encore performance of Beijing turning on the credit spigots to boost growth are likely to be disappointed. China's credit impulse is not as impulsive as it used be.\n\nThis should be underscored by the China's monetary aggregates, including new loans, which are due to be released this week. Consensus forecasts point to a modest increase in new yuan loans to 1.35 trillion yuan in September from 1.21 trillion yuan in August.\n\nBeijing has been determined to rein in the risks to the economy caused by the massive accumulation of debt in response to the global financial crisis.\n\nWhile the People's Bank of China has cut the reserve ratio requirement, freeing up banks to lend more, and lending rates have been lowered, lending growth has been muted. The provision of credit is far more targeted.\n\nGiven the headwinds for business caused by the trade war, Beijing is expected to provide further monetary and fiscal stimulus over coming months and into 2020. Beijing has already unveiled a tax package and key lending rates have been lowered.\n\nThe tough environment for business has been underscored by producer price deflation, as wholesale prices are cut to bolster demand and generate cash flows.\n\nAn antidote for sagging business confidence would be a trade deal that lifts some of the gloom from China-US trade relations.\n\nBut that is not a given in light of Beijing's mistrust of a temperamental US president.\n\nThe real test for Beijing is whether they can resist the temptation to pull the trigger on big time stimulus if Trump decides to tighten the screws rather than cut a deal.", "description": "As the US and China seek to get trade talks back on track this week, the simmering tensions has underscored China's importance as a driver of growth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3677%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5c33337b442a49e0ea176c865179e6145bd9aa6d", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
