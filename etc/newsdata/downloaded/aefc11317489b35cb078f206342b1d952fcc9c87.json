The picture is very clear now.\n\n\u201cCan we afford to start thinking about Japan? Not really, no. We have Russia first and if we don\u2019t get the job done against Russia there is no point in even thinking about Japan because we need those five points.\n\n\u201cEverything is focused on Russia now and getting that bonus-point win.\u201d\n\nThe Russians have shipped 99 points already having been thrashed in all three of their fixtures so far.\n\nBut Fagerson insists it would be folly to write off Lyn Jones\u2019 side ahead of their clash in Shizuoka.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you actually watch the Russia games in the World Cup so far, they have been there or thereabouts.\n\n\u201cThey were beating Japan at half-time, they are a very physical team, they are very well drilled in defence and have a really strong forward pack, that try to smash you up physically.\n\nZander Fagerson will not underestimate Russia (Jane Barlow/PA)\n\n\u201cWe are not taking Russia lightly at all. We do our due diligence and get all avenues into the game nailed down because they are going to be a tough game.\u201d\n\nFagerson made his World Cup debut during Monday\u2019s 34-0 win over Samoa as he got on for the final 22 minutes in Kobe.\n\nHe now looks certain to start against the Russians, with Townsend likely to split his squad in two as he juggles the pressures of playing two games in the space of four days against the requirement of taking enough points to seal progression.\n\nBut the 23-year-old says he will be a willing volunteer if asked to play both legs of the double-header.\n\n\u201cIf the opportunity arises I will grasp it with both hands,\u201d Fagerson said.\n\n\ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc63\udb40\udc74\udb40\udc7f\ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5 \"It [Russia] is a massive game and - if I'm playing - I'll be up for it and itching to go, as I'm sure a few other boys will be.\" - Adam Hastings.#AsOne #RWC2019 pic.twitter.com/CdZQnCOgN2 \u2014 Scottish Rugby (@Scotlandteam) October 5, 2019\n\n\u201cTo be at a World Cup is a great achievement but you are only half way there, I want to play as much as I can. If the opportunity arises I would love to play.\n\n\u201cI have done a few junior World Cups and know the four-day turnaround quite well. Of course international rugby is a lot more physical than the under-20s, most pools have had one of these games, it is part and parcel of the World Cup.\n\n\u201cRecovery is key, getting in the pool, keep stretching and being as professional as you can about it.\n\n\u201cIf called upon to play both games I will make sure I am in the right frame of mind and the right shape physically.\u201d", "description": "Scotland need a bonus-point win over the Bears.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/08/wire-19354128-1570345417-848_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
