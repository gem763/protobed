However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nFinding the right mattress, simply put, is hard. Some are too soft, some are too stiff, and you spend a third of your life on these things. You can't just order any old mattress. It's important to find the absolute best for you. There are side sleepers, single sleepers, hot sleepers (oh my!). Luckily, you can sift through thousands of reviews on the internet to help you make your decision. You don't even have to go to the store to buy one anymore; you can get one delivered right to your door. With all the options out there, it can be an overwhelming task.\n\nWe've simplified matters by conducting experiments on several top-rated \"mattresses in a box\", so that you don't have to. We've not only analyzed these mattresses under a microscope, but we also slept on them ourselves for at least 100 nights. We put mattresses to the test and what we found might surprise you.\n\n1. The best mattress in a box in 2019: Nectar\n\nThe best mattress from a box of 2019: Nectar (Photo: Nectar Sleep)\n\nOverall takeaway: The lightest and most comfortable mattress we\u2019ve tested so far.\n\nDelivery: Front door drop-off 2-3 days after placing an order. A Queen arrives in a 44\"x16\"x16\" box and weighs about 65 pounds.\n\nSizes: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King\n\nTrial period: 365 nights.\n\nReturn protocol: Nectar helps you coordinate donation or local disposal.\n\nWhat it's made of: Two layers of foam: on top, a 1-inch fast-recovery gel memory foam and a 3-inch 3.5-pound memory foam with medical-grade cooling, and beneath, a high-density base foam layer for support.\n\nThe details: The Nectar is by far and away the best mattress we\u2019ve tested to date, thanks to its perfect balance of firmness and plushness and its middle-tier price point. The first thing I noticed upon lugging the box up the two flights of stairs to my apartment was how unbelievably light it was compared to others. It\u2019s actually only a few pounds lighter, but that can make all the difference for installation. They also offer white glove delivery that starts at $149. It did have a bit of a weird \u2018packaged\u2019 smell at first, despite the site claiming you shouldn\u2019t notice any odors, but that dissipated after about 12 hours and was never an issue for me, my partner, or our cat.\n\nI tend to sleep hot, but I rarely had any issues with the Nectar, and my partner, who swears by the Purple, even admitted one day that this was the most comfortable mattress he\u2019s slept on so far. For me, that\u2019s all the proof I need, but I kept testing. The most important test has proven to be the \u201cwine glass\u201d test to evaluate motion transfer, and when my partner thrashed around and kicked his legs on the bed, the wine glass hardly even wobbled, and never came close to tipping over, meaning you won\u2019t get jostled awake if you share a bed with a restless sleeper or feel bad getting up to pee at 2 a.m.\n\nGet the Nectar mattress from Nectar for $699.\n\n2. The best value mattress in a box in 2019: Tuft & Needle\n\nThe best value mattress from a box of 2019: Tuft & Needle (Photo: Tuft & Needle)\n\nOverall takeaway: A fantastic budget option with great support.\n\nDelivery: Front door drop-off. A Queen arrives in a 44\"x16\"x16\" box and weighs about 72 pounds.\n\nSizes: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King\n\nTrial period: 100 nights.\n\nReturn protocol: Tuft & Needle coordinates pickup with a local charity or nonprofit, free of charge.\n\nWhat it's made of: Two layers of foam: on top, a soft 3-inch layer infused with cooling gel and graphite, and beneath, a firm 7-inch layer for support.\n\nThe details: Tuft & Needle is a fantastic mattress for anyone looking for a bit more support in a mattress. By far the least expensive model we tested, it was a favorite for its firmness and comfort. It's supportive yet soft, so getting in and out of bed isn\u2019t difficult or painful. In both clinical and practical testing, we found that the mattress mitigates movement well which means that a tossing-and-turning partner won\u2019t wake you up.\n\nThe mattress is cased in a slightly cheap-feeling mattress cover that\u2019s designed to be breathable. It bunches up a bit beneath tight-fitting sheets, but not distractingly so. Tuft & Needle's excellent, prompt, friendly customer service is a perk, as well. At this intersection of price and quality, you'll be hard-pressed to find a better pick.\n\nGet the Tuft & Needle mattress on Amazon for $595\n\n3. The best luxury mattress in a box of 2019: Helix Midnight\n\nHelix (Photo: Helix)\n\nOverall takeaway: A great mattress for side sleepers that could use some improvement with packaging.\n\nDelivery: Front door drop-off. The Queen arrives in a rectangular cardboard box with no handles. It weighs about 70 pounds.\n\nSizes: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King\n\nTrial period: 100 nights.\n\nReturn protocol: Removal partners come to your house and take it away to donate or recycle.\n\nWhat it's made of: Hybrid mattress constructed from memory foam, polyfoam, wrapped coils, and hard foam called \u201cduradense\u201d foam at the base.\n\nThe details: Before ordering a Helix mattress, you take a brief survey on their website that uses your height, weight, usual sleeping position, and preferred mattress firmness to determine your ideal mattress. I sleep on my side and prefer a medium-to-firm mattress, which gave me the Helix Midnight, a 12-inch mattress with medium support and a hybrid foam-spring composition. This also happens to be the brand\u2019s best-selling mattress.\n\nOverall, I loved it\u2014but I had some difficulties with its delivery. The box that got dropped off outside my door had no handles, and it was heavy, so I had to enlist two of my roommates to help me hoist it up the stairs to get to my bedroom. This took a long time, not because it was heavy (though, at about 70 pounds, it was), but because the box didn\u2019t have a great place to grip and kept slipping out of our hands. Once I got it to my room, though, the unboxing process was pretty easy (I had to snip off a lot of plastic wrap, but that\u2019s common in the boxed mattress experience). There was also a strong chemical smell on the mattress that stuck around after I unwrapped it, but that dissipated a little bit each day and went away fully in about a week.\n\nThat said, I slept really well on the Helix Midnight. It has a perfect medium-firm feel, with some give when you lay down on it, but a distinctive sensation of deeper support at its core. I\u2019ve always been a side sleeper, but on my old spring-filled mattress, I would sometimes wake up with a sore, crooked-feeling back and aches in my hips where the springs had dug into them. On the Midnight, however, I felt alignment on my side when I woke up, and, because the mattress\u2019s interior coils are surrounded by memory foam, no piercing pains in my hips. It felt comfortable if I ever rolled over to my back or stomach, too. I also tend to sleep hot (and my apartment doesn\u2019t have air conditioning), so I was pleased that the mattress didn\u2019t retain too much of my body heat, even when I was sweating in the night. All in all, it\u2019s a great mattress at a decent price, particularly if you\u2019re a side sleeper.\n\nGet the Helix mattress on Helix for $995\n\n4. Purple\n\nThe best mattress from a box of 2019: Purple (Photo: Purple)\n\nOverall takeaway: A super comfortable mattress with an irresistible, unique take on comfort.\n\nDelivery: Front door drop-off. The Queen arrives in a 60-inch-long plastic purple tube with fabric handles and weighs about 72 pounds.\n\nSizes: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King\n\nTrial period: 100 nights.\n\nReturn protocol: Purple will send you a return label and then a customer service rep will help you through the process. They even have an option to have them handle all the details, including scheduling the pickup.\n\nWhat it's made of: Three layers: On top is a 2-inch \"hyper-elastic polymer\" in a grid design that feels similar to silicone. In the middle is a 3.5-inch layer of mid-density \"comfort\" foam, and on the bottom is a 4-inch layer of high-density \"support\" foam. It's all wrapped in a soft, washable cover.\n\nThe details: Most every other mattress out there today is made of memory foam, coils, or are hybrid mattresses, which are some combination therein. Purple sets itself apart with its unique gel-like material that forms the top layer of its mattresses. The result is an undeniably comfortable surface that hugs your body without feeling like quicksand. The unusual material absorbs movement extremely well, and when my partner rolled and flopped around on his side of the bed, the filled wine glass I had balanced on my side hardly even wiggled from the motion.\n\nThe extreme squish and stretch of the top polymer layer makes it seem like you wouldn't get much support, but it's quite the opposite. It cradles you no matter if you're a side, stomach, or back sleeper. This was the first mattress I tested, and I'd been dealing with the quintessential \"I'm not 25 anymore and work at a desk all day\" lower back pain. It wasn't long after I started sleeping on the Purple that my pain diminished significantly, and that's a big reason why I sleep on this mattress now (when I'm not testing other mattresses).\n\nPurple also has no competition when it comes to delivery. The others, excluding the Saatva, all arrive in these massive boxes that are awkward and near-impossible to haul into your home, especially if your bedroom's not on the first floor. Purple's mattresses arrive wrapped in plastic tubing that has cloth straps stitched right in. There's so much less waste, and they include a convenient cutting tool to slice right through the bag, so there's no struggle to tug a 70-pound tube out of a big clumsy box.\n\nGet the Purple mattress on Amazon for $999\n\n5. Saatva\n\nThe best mattress from a box of 2019: Saatva (Photo: Saatva)\n\nOverall takeaway: A plush mattress that's very comfortable but a little too big.\n\nDelivery: White-glove delivery service. The mattress is not just dropped at your doorstep, but brought inside and placed on the bed frame for you. No heavy-lifting on your part.\n\nSizes: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King\n\nTrial period: 120 nights.\n\nReturn protocol: Saatva offers white-glove removal if you are not satisfied with your mattress, but you will be charged $99 for their efforts. They donate their mattresses to veterans' shelters or give them to employees, and there's no apparent option to handle the donation yourself for a full refund like other companies offer.\n\nWhat it's made of: Recycled steel rod coils, eco-friendly pillow-top foam, natural flame retardant barrier, and organic cotton cover.\n\nThe details: When you first lay down on the Saatva, you'll think you've been transported to a suite at a luxury resort. This thing is comfortable as heck and it didn't hurt that I did nothing more than hold open doors to let the delivery guys in and lead them to my waiting bed frame. I was honestly surprised that it didn't tie with the Purple and Tuft & Needle. The reason? It's inconveniently large and was one of the worst at absorbing movement\u2014at $100 more than the Purple, it got knocked down just a couple pegs.\n\nThe model I tested was 14.5 inches thick, nearly double the thickness of most mattresses, which made it nearly impossible for my regular sheets to stay put. The mattress was also the worst at absorbing movement. When we conducted the wine glass test, this was one of the two mattresses that threatened to tip the glass and send the wine (ok, we tested with water) flying.\n\nI'm a pretty tall lady at 5'10, and because the mattress is so thick, I had to sort of hop into the bed every night. While the added bed height felt luxurious in that \"where's my royal stepping stool, you peasant?\" kind of way, it may not be ideal if you're shorter than me, if you have any sort of pain or injury, or are otherwise restricted in movement. That said, Saatva does offer a thinner, 11.5-inch option that would probably be fantastic if you sleep alone or heavily enough that your partner's midnight bathroom trip won't wake you. You can also choose your ideal firmness. For the sake of this test, I went with \"Luxury Firm,\" the most popular option, but you can opt for \"Plush Soft\" or \"Firm\" as well.\n\nGet the Saatva mattress from Saatva for $1,099\n\n6. Casper\n\nThe best mattress from a box of 2019: Casper (Photo: Casper)\n\nOverall takeaway: A beautiful aesthetic that is overshadowed by an unsupportive mattress.\n\nDelivery: Front door drop-off. The Queen Casper box is 17\"x17\"x42\" and weighs about 90 pounds.\n\nSizes: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King\n\nTrial period: 100 nights.\n\nReturn protocol: Casper arranges a pickup through a local charity or recycling partner and refunds you in full for any associated costs.\n\nWhat it's made of: A 10-inch thick mattress with four layers of foam: a breathable open-cell foam on top, followed by a layer of high-density foam, then a layer of \"zoned transition foam\" (meant to support different areas of the body appropriately), and finally, a durable support foam on the bottom.\n\nThe details: The ubiquitous mattress in a box, Casper has a very attractive, high-quality feel: but it\u2019s simply just too soft to measure up to the competition. The luxe design aims to target zones like your shoulders and hips, and the mattress is cased in a high-quality zippered cover that fits snug around the mattress. However, the mattress feels spongy and that lack of firmness (and therefore, resistance) makes it difficult to move around and get in and out of bed.\n\nYou\u2019ll also feel a lot of movement from a partner or pet moving around on the bed: when we balanced a filled wine glass on one side and kicked around on the other, the wine glass nearly toppled over. Worst, support at the edge of the mattress seemed markedly lower than at the center, and buckled beneath average pressure. Is it a bad mattress? No. Can you do better for the price? Yes.\n\nGet the Casper mattress on Amazon for $903.47\n\n7. Layla\n\nThe best mattress from a box of 2019: Layla (Photo: Layla)\n\nOverall takeaway: An unusual mattress made with copper that's firm and soft.\n\nDelivery: Front door drop-off. The Queen Layla box is 45\"x19\"x19\" and weighs about 80 pounds.\n\nSizes: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King\n\nTrial period: 120 nights.\n\nReturn protocol: Layla offers a few different options, including coordinating pickup by a local charity, and will give you a full refund.\n\nWhat it's made of: Four layers: 3-inch copper-infused memory foam (soft side topper), 2-inch support foam with air flow, 4.5-inch base support foam, and 1-inch copper-infused memory foam (firm side topper).\n\nThe details: Layla sets itself apart from the rest with an unusual feature. This mattress has two sides. One is firm and the other soft. It's a cool concept if you aren't sure what you'd prefer, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. First off, the soft side is so soft that you sink in too far. And the 'firm' side really isn't all that firm, considering it's resting on a whole bunch of ultra-soft memory foam. It's more like this mattress has a soft side and a too-soft side.\n\nAside from never quite getting used to how soft the soft side was, I didn't notice any difference in how I was sleeping. The memory foam on both sides is infused with copper, which claims to help keep you cooler. I woke up dripping in sweat the first two nights, but I'd also just had oral surgery which could have influenced my reaction. After the first two nights, I seemed to settle into the mattress and didn't have any further issues with overheating. But I didn't notice that I felt cooler than usual, either.\n\nGet the Layla mattress from Layla for $999\n\nPrices are accurate at the time this article was published but may change over time.\n\nThis article features excerpts of product reviews published on Reviewed.
