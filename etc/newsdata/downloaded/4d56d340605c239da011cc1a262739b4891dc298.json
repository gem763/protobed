President George Bush was losing his re-election race, and they told him the only way to win was to hammer his challenger Bill Clinton\u2019s patriotism for protesting the Vietnam War while in London and visiting Moscow as a young man.\n\nMr. Bush was largely on board with that approach. But what came next crossed the line, as far as he and his team were concerned. \u201cThey wanted us to contact the Russians or the British to seek information on Bill Clinton\u2019s trip to Moscow,\u201d James A. Baker III, Mr. Bush\u2019s White House chief of staff, wrote in a memo later that day. \u201cI said we absolutely could not do that.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump insists he and his attorney general did nothing wrong by seeking damaging information about his domestic opponents from Ukraine, Australia, Italy and Britain or by publicly calling on China to investigate his most prominent Democratic challenger. But for every other White House in the modern era, Republican and Democratic, the idea of enlisting help from foreign powers for political advantage was seen as unwise and politically dangerous, if not unprincipled.\n\nA survey of 10 former White House chiefs of staff under Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama found that none recalled any circumstance under which the White House had solicited or accepted political help from other countries, and all said they would have considered the very idea out of bounds.", "description": "In every other modern White House, enlisting foreign powers to obtain a political advantage at home was seen as unwise and politically dangerous, if not wrong.", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/06/us/politics/06dc-memo2-hp-promo/06dc-memo2-hp-promo-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
