REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo\n\nArdern, 39, faces a general election expected in the second half of 2020, after having taken the helm of the Labour-led government in October 2017 and won praise for her views on issues such as women\u2019s rights, climate change and diversity.\n\nBut domestic critics have questioned her leadership amid sinking business confidence, a slowing economy, governance issues and, most recently, her party\u2019s handling of sexual assault complaints.\n\nSupport for the center-left coalition government has dropped to its worst since 2017, while the opposition National Party has enough backing to form the next coalition government, a 1News/Colmar Brunton poll by state broadcaster 1News showed on Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, responding to the poll result, which showed support for the Labour-led coalition fell three percentage points to 40%, Ardern said she was not disappointed, and was pleased with the government\u2019s progress.\n\n\u201cWhen you reflect on our polling that brought us in and allowed us to actually form a government, we\u2019re doing better in this poll than we did even on election night,\u201d Ardern told 1News.\n\n\u201cThere is more work to do, and of course, we have a year left in government.\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s rating was just off a figure of 39% in a poll in Nov-Dec 2017, soon after Ardern took power that October, but while her rating as preferred prime minister also dropped in the poll, she was still far ahead of all her opponents.\n\nAnother poll by Newshub-Reid Research last week also showed Ardern\u2019s party losing support.\n\n\u201cOverall, we can assume at this stage that next year\u2019s election is likely to be a closely-matched competition,\u201d said political commentator Bryce Edwards of Victoria University in Wellington.\n\n\u201cPreviously there had been an assumption that a Labour-led coalition was much more likely to eventuate again next year, whereas now that is far from certain, and the best guess is that the result could go either way.\u201d\n\nThe Labour-led coalition is strong and delivering on its promises, Ardern told supporters on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve increased our support since we were elected and we are delivering the change New Zealanders asked for,\u201d she said in a speech to the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions.\n\nArdern\u2019s coalition ended nearly 10 years of the National Party\u2019s center-right rule in 2017, promising more money for social services and vowing to rein in foreign investment.\n\nShe became a global inspiration to women after the unexpected election win, and was only the second leader to give birth while in office since Pakistan\u2019s Benazir Bhutto.\n\nHer compassionate response to the mass shooting in Christchurch mosques in March was cheered around the world, and her government unveiled a budget this year that prioritizes well-being over economic growth.", "description": "New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is pleased with her government's progress, she said on Tuesday, after two closely watched opinion polls showed support for her ruling coalition at its lowest since 2017, and her own popularity waning.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1440987749&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E08H", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
