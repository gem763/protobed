It is the basis and premise for China to carry out all foreign exchanges and cooperation,\u201d the embassy added.\n\nTies have already been dented by a warning last year by the Czech cyber-security watchdog against the risks of using equipment made by China\u2019s Huawei [HWT.UL] and ZTE in critical infrastructure.\n\nExpectations of billions of dollars worth of Chinese investments in the country have also not materialized.", "description": "China hit back on Wednesday at a decision by the Prague city council to cancel a partnership agreement with Beijing that would have required it to commit to the \"one China\" principle affirming that Taiwan is a part of China.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
