Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nThe Game: Tampa Bay Rays @ Houston Astros\n\nThe Place: Minute Made Park, Houston, Texas\n\nThe Time: 7:07 PM Eastern\n\nThe Channel: FS1\n\nThe Starters: Tyler Glasnow vs. Gerrit Cole\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAs this series has progressed \u2014 and as the Rays have pulled even and stand poised to pull off the upset \u2014 its been increasingly cast as an historical upset in the making. And, sure, the Astros have been considered the favorites by just about everyone coming into the postseason.\n\nBut theres a difference between a team being a favorite and a matchup being a mismatch. The Astros may have been the best team in the game this season and the Rays may have been a Wild Card team, but there\u2019s probably less of a difference between these two teams than one typically sees between a best team and a Wild Card qualifier. The Rays are good \u2014 they won 96 games \u2014 and they\u2019ve shown in this series that they are not at all intimidated by this Astros club. If they win, sure, it\u2019ll be an upset, but it won\u2019t be a 1969 Mets situation.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot that their task is an easy one. Indeed, it\u2019s about as hard as it gets tonight given that they\u2019ll be facing Gerrit Cole. The same Gerrit Cole who has only been the best pitcher in baseball for the past several months, having elevated his already great game to a whole new level since, oh, May. The Astros haven\u2019t lost a Cole start since July 12, which was 14 starts ago. They haven\u2019t lost a Cole start at home since May 22. He kicked it up a notch in Game 2 of the ALDS last weekend, tossing shutout ball into the eighth, allowing only four hits and one walk, and becoming the first pitcher to strike out 15 batters in a postseason game in nearly 20 years. Heck, he\u2019s struck out nearly 14 batters per nine all season long. He is absolutely on top of his game and the Rays have their work cut out for them.\n\nThe Astros don\u2019t have a simple task themselves. Tyler Glasnow didn\u2019t have the best start in Game 1 of this series, running out of gas in the fifth inning as the Astros beat the Rays 6-2. But, as he showed earlier this season, he\u2019s capable of dominating even the best offenses. If he falters the Rays have wave after wave of effective relief pitchers they can run out there. So far in this series they\u2019ve been pretty effective. During the regular season, the Astros led the Majors with an .848 OPS and were third in runs scored, averaging 5.68 runs per game. In the ALDS, the Astros have a .685 OPS and have scored just over three runs a a game.\n\nA betting man would have a hard time going against Cole given how well he\u2019s pitched of late. But then again, a betting man probably had the Dodgers and Braves advancing in the NLDS too. None of us, apparently, knows anything. All we know is that tonight one of these two teams will advance and one of them will see its season end.", "description": "If the Rays are to advance to the ALCS, they will have to go through the best pitcher going right now, Gerrit Cole", "authors": ["Craig Calcaterra"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/g0W.3LJ3.SSRb46I_1LfRw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03ODIuOTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RxCH4nkfajE8maxP5IR0fA--~B/aD05Nzc7dz0xNTk4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/c217297713f43442c5418544bcfda98e", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
