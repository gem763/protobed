You cannot beat this!\"\n\nIn August, Catzavelos reached a settlement agreement with the South African Human Rights Commission relating to the video.\n\nAs part of the agreement, he has to pay R150 000 over a period of 30 months and will once again apologise for his comments.\n\nHe has also been summonsed for the matter in Greece, News24 reported earlier.\n\n- Compiled by Riaan Grobler\n\n\n\n", "description": "The crimen injuria case against Adam Catzavelos - who went viral in a video in which he used the k-word - has been postponed to November 12 in the Equality Court sitting in the Randburg Magistrate's Court.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7850/ea428f38f87141188a05de820b166863.png", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
