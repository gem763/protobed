The \u201cIron Man\u201d actor was asked by Howard Stern to comment on Scorsese\u2019s opinion that Marvel movies are more like theme parks than actual cinema. Downey Jr. welcomed Scorsese\u2019s opinion, making it clear that he is well aware Marvel has become Hollywood\u2019s most powerful force. As Downey Jr. put it for comic book fans, \u201cIt is this very large, multi-headed Hydra at this point.\u201d\n\nStern asked Downey Jr. point black if Marvel movies were \u201ccinema,\u201d to which the actor replied, \u201cI mean it plays in theaters. I appreciate [Scorsese\u2019s] opinion. I think it\u2019s like anything where we need all of the different perspectives so we can come to center and move on.\u201d Downey Jr. may welcome Scorsese\u2019s opinion, but it appears he doesn\u2019t so readily agree. Asked if Scorsese insulted him, Downey Jr. answered, \u201cNo. It\u2019d be like saying Howard Stern isn\u2019t radio. It makes no sense to say it.\u201d\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nDowney Jr. added, \u201cOf course he\u2019s not jealous of the success. He\u2019s Martin Scorsese. By the way, there is a lot to be said for how these genre movies, and I was happy to be part of the \u201cproblem,\u201d if there is one, but how they have denigrated the era, the art form of cinema. When you come in like a stomping beast and you eliminate the competition in such a demonstrative way, it\u2019s phenomenal.\u201d\n\nScorsese\u2019s original comment was given to Empire magazine. \u201cI don\u2019t see them. I tried, you know? But that\u2019s not cinema,\u201d Scorsese said when asked about Marvel movies. \u201cHonestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\u201d\n\nScorsese\u2019s critique has launched an endless wave of reactions from filmmakers and actors who have contributed to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d director James Gunn said he was \u201csaddened\u201d by Scorsese\u2019s thoughts, while Samuel L. Jackson snapped back that not \u201ceverybody loves [Scorsese\u2019s] movies either.\u201d\n\nLaunch Gallery: 'Avengers: Endgame' Premiere: The Entire MCU Unites, From Brie Larson to Natalie Portman (Photos)\n\nBest of IndieWire\n\nSign up for Indiewire's Newsletter.
