Prices rose this week after Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman,\n\nSaudi Arabia's new energy minister, said oil policy would not\n\nchange and said an OPEC deal with Russia and other producers to\n\ncut output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) would be\n\nmaintained. Iraqi Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban said the Organization of\n\nthe Petroleum Exporting Countries would discuss whether to\n\ndeepen cuts, when ministers meet on Thursday. He said OPEC had\n\ndiscussed cuts of 1.6 million to 1.8 million bpd, when\n\nconsidering output curbs last year. Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak said the alliance\n\nof OPEC and other producers, known as OPEC+, would discuss\n\nglobal oil demand, but added that there were no fresh proposals\n\nto change production cut volumes.\n\nOPEC cut its forecast on Wednesday for growth in world oil\n\ndemand in 2020 by 60,000 bpd to 1.08 million bpd, due to an\n\neconomic slowdown. It indicated the market would be in surplus.\n\nOPEC/M\n\nThe U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA) also slashed\n\nits demand forecasts this week. Growing signs of slowdown were flagged by oil traders and\n\nexecutives attending industry gatherings in Singapore and Abu\n\nDhabi this week. OPEC has pointed to rising global production next year,\n\nparticularly in U.S. shale fields, while data from the American\n\nPetroleum Institute (API) showed U.S. crude stocks fell last\n\nweek by 7.2 million barrels, more than twice the amount analysts\n\nin a Reuters poll had forecast. API/S\n\n\"The API report is quite constructive for the oil market as\n\nit points to a tightening domestic oil market in the face of\n\nflat production and stronger demand,\" Dutch bank ING said.\n\nThe EIA's official numbers for U.S. inventories will be\n\nreleased at 1430 GMT on Wednesday.
