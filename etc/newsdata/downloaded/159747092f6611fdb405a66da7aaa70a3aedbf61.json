Enraged, he told reporters that there was \u201csomething going on\u201d at the network. \u201cWe have to start looking for a new News Outlet,\u201d he later tweeted. \u201cFox isn\u2019t working for us anymore!\u201d\n\nIn a different time, with a different president, Fox would have brushed such criticisms aside, but in August, longtime Fox Business host Neil Cavuto asserted his journalistic independence\u2014\u201cMy job is to cover you, not fawn over you or rip you\u201d\u2014and pundit Brit Hume said that Fox News \u201cisn\u2019t supposed to work for you.\u201d This lovers\u2019 quarrel caused speculation in the press about a split between the president and a network that has lately earned the derisive nickname \u201cstate television,\u201d but in truth, there have always been dissenters at the network. Shepard Smith, Fox\u2019s chief news anchor, and Chris Wallace, its owlish Sunday host, frequently jab the president and his administration; Tucker Carlson has waffled back and forth; and Trump has hit back\u2014frequently, viciously, and whenever it suits him. In 2016, his feud with Megyn Kelly led him to boycott multiple Fox debates. More recently, he has criticized such Fox personalities as John Roberts, Gillian Turner, and, of course, Smith, of whom he said, \u201cWatching Fake News CNN is better.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to read deeper meaning into these tiffs, but Fox has never given pride of place to Never Trumpers in the way more genteel, conservative print magazines like The Weekly Standard and National Review have. The rare gadflies who distance themselves from the president on Fox aren\u2019t raising substantive ideological concerns. Rather, they\u2019re performing a kind of Kabuki theater by pretending to be affronted at the suggestion that they\u2019d compromised their journalistic principles. That\u2019s because Fox, unlike its print counterparts, has no particular attachment to any faction of American conservatism other than whichever one happens to be dominant. In the Obama years, when Republicans were out of power, the channel became a kind of Swiss Army knife of right-wing reaction, airing meaningless scandals and racist conspiracy theories. Now the best way to preserve its access is to celebrate Trump\u2019s achievements. And Fox\u2019s mercurial strategy has proved to be undeniably lucrative; today, with profits rising, network executives can offer contributors plush salaries. So even if Trump\u2019s Learish personality makes him bristle at negative polls, his foot soldiers won\u2019t abandon the network: Just days after he noticed something \u201cgoing on\u201d at Fox, his former press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed on as a contributing commentator.", "description": "Trump is accusing the network of disloyalty, but he's missing the point.", "authors": ["Jake Bittle"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/38e99b3a37a0275cb407fa5b41be187bcb8f5804.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
