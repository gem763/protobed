Johnson & Johnson, meanwhile, reported sales in markets outside the U.S. were 2.8% lower because of currency effects.\n\nPhilip Morris's net revenue was reduced by $115 million because of currency effects in the third quarter, resulting in a foreign-exchange impact of $931 million since the beginning of the year. \"Currency is something that is very hard to predict,\" Chief Financial Officer Martin King said in an interview Thursday. The company hedges against movements in some currencies, including the Japanese yen, he said.\n\nDuring the second quarter, North American companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq recorded currency-related losses of $21.01 billion, down from $23.39 billion in the first quarter, according to Kyriba. Exchange rate-related losses at these companies have exceeded $20 billion for three consecutive quarters.\n\nEuropean companies listed on the FTSE 100 and Euronext reported a decline in foreign-exchange effects to $1.55 billion in the second quarter, down from $3.31 billion in the first quarter of 2019, Kyriba said.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 17, 2019 17:24 ET (21:24 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
