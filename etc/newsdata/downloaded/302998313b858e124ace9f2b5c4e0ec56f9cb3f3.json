She had been thrown into the deep end of Hollywood\u2019s unforgiving waters as a child actor, and since her early success, every aspect of her life had been marred by desperate attempts to keep her head above water. Unsuccessful marriages to other struggling artists, an addiction to drugs that was spurred on by abusive producers and, above all, her constant anxiety to control her appearance \u2013 all these problems were symptoms of her toxic relationship with Hollywood. \u201cIsn\u2019t this pretty good for somebody Hollywood thought as too old, too fat and too undependable to offer a job?\u201d she wrote. Judy, the new film starring Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, recounts the sad ending that she was heading for instead.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ready for the future \u2026 Ren\u00e9e Zellweger in Judy. Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nJudy joins the list of Hollywood biopics that carry an air of atonement, in which the misfortunes of earlier generations of stars who were cast away from the industry \u2013 largely due to their age \u2013 are memorialised and sentimentalised. Films such as The Artist and Film Stars Don\u2019t Die in Liverpool have an admirable goal: celebrating the lives of performers who were callously underappreciated toward the end of their careers. But it is becoming more and more difficult to take away a positive message when Hollywood itself draws attention to how much Hollywood hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nThe star of Judy is herself re-emerging from a hiatus: one that was caused by the same maladies afflicting old Hollywood that the movie depicts. Zellweger retreated from acting after she entered Hollywood\u2019s dead zone for women aged 40 or over. She borrows from a familiar sense of disenchantment with the profession when she tries to give life to Garland\u2019s emotional state at the end of her life. In interviews for the movie, Zellweger says she is ready for the roles that will embody her maturity. Whether the studios have the same plans remains to be seen.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Unexpected hit \u2026 Judi Dench in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. Photograph: Ishika Mohan\n\nSome big-screen veterans still attract an enthusiastic audience. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, starring Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, and Bill Nighy, which explored the lives of retired Brits living in an Indian hotel, exceeded expectations by grossing more than $130m worldwide. Book Club put the same trust in the box-office power of older American actors, including Jane Fonda, Diane Keaton and Candice Bergen. Both movies secured sequels and softened the industry\u2019s attitude towards taking risks with older actors.\n\nBut for every hard-earned movie project that serves the age demographic well by telling a complicated story about old age, Hollywood churns out two Schwarzenegger movies with tag lines like, \u201cRetirement is for sissies\u201d. There are obviously Hollywood pitch meetings reserved for the older male action stars of the 80s. Twelve of the 15 highest-grossing movies of that decade have been remade, and most of them are produced to mask the age of their stars. Rambo 5, Terminator 6, Die Hard 5, Indiana Jones 5 and now the second Top Gun, all ride the new American myth of super-agers.\n\nTo pull this off, Hollywood encourages bizarre anti-ageing clinics even as it abandons the female stars of the 80s, pairing their former male co-stars with much younger on-screen love interests. And now the industry has added a new weapon to its digital arsenal: de-ageing technology. Advocates believe that VFX technology could help ameliorate the representation problem. But it\u2019s more likely that de-ageing technology help Hollywood avoid the problem of finding roles for older stars by erasing signs of age as opposed to embracing them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sweet duet \u2026 Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn in On Golden Pond. Photograph: ITV/Rex\n\nIn the past, small- to mid-budget projects have been the most welcoming to older stars. Many darlings of the screen who hit their peak in the 1940s, 50s and the 60s bid their adieu delivering memorable performances in this subgenre. Among them were Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda playing ageing parents in On Golden Pond, John Wayne as an out-of-time gunslinger in The Shootist, and Julie Christie as a woman struggling with memory loss in Away from Her. More recent examples \u2013 Robert Redford in The Old Man and the Gun and Clint Eastwood in The Mule \u2013 underwhelmed artistically and commercially.\n\nPerhaps Marlon Brando was the most accurate predictor of the future. Toward the end of his career, he had come to terms with Hollywood\u2019s commodification of youth and vitality. He sought the help of early adopters of VFX technology to create an animated 3D version of his face, believing that the studios would, after his death, want to keep a young Brando alive on the screen. \u201cMaybe this is the swan song for all of us,\u201d he said, even though it\u2019s not real and \u201cinside a computer\u201d. Today, Hollywood\u2019s fascination with de-ageing technology seems to affirm Brando\u2019s bleak premonition, as it continues to insist older actors surrender to its obsession with youth.", "description": "Ren\u00e9e Zellweger\u2019s Garland biopic is a powerful reminder of the attitudes that infect youth-obsessed Hollywood", "authors": ["Kia Rahnama"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0036be9aabfaa74bf3942a71adad323c3fb47b3/0_101_2789_1674/master/2789.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=adbd6e7c44844736f19092d775a65c3a", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
