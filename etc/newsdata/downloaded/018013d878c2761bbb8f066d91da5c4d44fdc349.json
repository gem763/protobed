John Bel Edwards offering different takes on the cause of shutdown that cost the community nearly 400 jobs.\n\nBayou Steel in LaPlace, La., which also has operations in Tennessee, shuttered suddenly on Sept. 30.\n\nThe company blamed \u201cunforeseen circumstances and the inability to secure necessary capital\u201d for the closure and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nBut Mr. Edwards, who faces an Oct. 12 primary in his re-election bid and is running in large part on his economic stewardship of Louisiana, blamed Bayou Steel\u2019s abrupt end it on the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on China.\n\nThe tariffs, according to Edwards, led to the trade war that made operations too expensive for Bayou Steel.\n\nThat\u2019s a fairy tale, according to the Trump administration.\n\nBayou Steel\u2019s principal source material is scrap steel, according to its website, the import of which is not currently subject to tariffs or quotas. In fact, the U.S. is a net exporter of steel scrap.\n\nPeter Navarro, President Trump\u2019s trade advisor ripped Mr. Edwards\u2019 spin as a \u201cshamelessly partisan attack,\u201d and the governor\u2019s Republican challengers also chimed in.\n\n\u201cMore blame and more lies from Governor John Bel Edwards,\u201d Republican Rep. Ralph Abraham wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cHe blames President Donald J. Trump because he won\u2019t take accountability for anything and he lies because he can\u2019t defend his record. Time to fire this governor.\u201d\n\nThe Edwards campaign and administration did not immediately respond Sunday to a request for comment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
