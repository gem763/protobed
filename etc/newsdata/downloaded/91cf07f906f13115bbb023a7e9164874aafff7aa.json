Officials from the White House and federal agencies were then dispatched to Los Angeles, touring Skid Row and meeting with local authorities. No concrete plans have been announced, but ideas said to be under consideration include using federal resources to get people experiencing homelessness off the streets and into shelters that would be fashioned from unused government facilities. How this would be accomplished \u2014 and under what legal authority \u2014 is unclear.\n\nMr. Trump is not wrong to identify homelessness as a large and growing problem. He is right that California \u2014 which has the highest number of homeless people in the country, many of whom live on the streets \u2014 has some singular issues. But it\u2019s clear he is out not to help the homeless but rather to stigmatize them. How else to explain his comments about police \u201cgetting sick\u201d from interacting with the homeless? Or his concern for the people who own property and pay taxes but not for those who aren\u2019t fortunate to be able to own homes? Just as reckless as his rhetoric are some of the ideas for federal action being bandied about, such as citing San Francisco for environmental damage caused by homeless people. This from an administration that is going to enormous lengths to kill California\u2019s clean-air car standards.\n\nFederal involvement in helping cities and states deal with the social, economic and demographic factors of homelessness is long overdue. But it is hard to take Mr. Trump\u2019s interest seriously when his administration has also proposed cutting federal housing dollars and undoing Obama-era rules that aimed to desegregate neighborhoods. Another proposed policy would deny federal housing aid to households that include anyone living in the United States illegally, even when other members are eligible for aid as lawful residents or citizens. And the administration would let homeless shelters refuse shelter to transgender people.\n\nCities have always been an easy target for Mr. Trump. Given that in 2016 he lost the urban vote by almost 2 to 1, he doesn\u2019t see political risk, only political advantage. And, that sad to say, is all that seems to matter to him.\n\nRead more:\n\nPaul Waldman: What Trump\u2019s authoritarian push on homelessness is really about\n\nLetters to the Editor: House the homeless at a Trump property, and solve two problems at once\n\nPatrick Geiger and Aaron Howe: D.C.\u2019s homeless encampment \u2018cleanups\u2019 are only making things worse\n\nMarc A.
