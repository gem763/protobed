But what are we laughing at?", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nJoaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck in \"Joker.\" (Niko Tavernise/Warner Bros. Pictures via AP)\n\nWarning: This post contains plot spoilers for \u201cJoker.\u201d\n\nBuried in a Vanity Fair profile of \u201cJoker\u201d star Joaquin Phoenix is a bitter remark from director Todd Phillips that made headlines of its own. He mentioned how difficult he finds it \u201cto be funny nowadays with this woke culture,\u201d pointing to a societal shift in values as the reason he chose to take a break from comedies such as \u201cthe Hangover\u201d series and instead apply that irreverence to an R-rated comic book film.\n\nThe Scorsese-inspired result, \u201cJoker,\u201d is as gritty a drama as it gets, a stark contrast with the laughter woven through the viewing experience. On-screen laughs, both maniacal and otherwise, were bound to be plentiful in a movie about Hollywood\u2019s favorite Batman villain. But Phillips, who co-wrote the script, elicits this response from his viewers as well \u2014 and it\u2019s often directed at the character he paints as downtrodden, leading us to wonder what the \u201cwoke culture\u201d-decrying director is trying to say.\n\nThe film\u2019s Joker is Arthur Fleck (Phoenix), a clown who aspires to be a stand-up comedian like his hero, late-night host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). Fleck, who lives in a grimy Gotham apartment with his mother (Frances Conroy), suffers from unspecified mental illnesses and a condition that causes him to break into random bouts of high-pitched, hysterical laughter. The fits leave people around Fleck confused, a feeling that sometimes evolves into fear or hostility, even after he hands them the card he carries around that explains the condition.\n\nAs a result, the alienated man is a frequent target of violent teenagers and entitled Wall Street bros, three of whom he ends up murdering on the subway \u2014 a crime that sets him on a dangerous path and sparks a kill-the-rich movement among Gotham\u2019s struggling citizens.\n\n[Review: Joaquin Phoenix is a vivid, operatic Joker, but the movie is way too full of itself]\n\nFleck initially seems to be a sympathetic character, one whose own boss doesn\u2019t believe his story about how teenagers stole a store-closing sign he\u2019d been spinning on the sidewalk and then beat him up when he chased after them. He also becomes a victim of Gotham\u2019s incompetent health-care system when the city cuts funding for the program that provided him with therapy and medications.\n\nAnd yet much of the film\u2019s humor is at Fleck\u2019s expense. Early on, Phillips stations musical cues and directs Phoenix\u2019s performance in a manner that highlights the absurdity of Fleck\u2019s condition. After he is unfairly chastised by his boss, for example, Fleck bursts into a fit of laughter that suddenly cuts off as he lumbers down a quiet, empty hallway. Viewers might laugh, too, and the movie seems to want them to.\n\nBut why? As \u201cJoker\u201d progresses, Phoenix amps up the grotesque nature of Fleck\u2019s behavior, suggesting the audience is not really meant to sympathize with the character. Extremely fair, given that he commits multiple brutal murders on screen. On the flip side, he\u2019s also portrayed as a sick man ushered into darkness by his delusions and society\u2019s great ills. By setting viewers up to laugh at Fleck\u2019s struggles \u2014 unfortunate timing that, in a sense, reflects his own condition \u2014 is Phillips indicting them as well?\n\n[Why \u2018Joker\u2019 became one of the most divisive movies of the year]\n\nPerhaps the takeaway is obvious: that life is one big joke, echoing Fleck\u2019s on-the-nose musing about how he thought his life was a tragedy but realizes it\u2019s a comedy. A more nihilist read of what Phillips chooses to play for laughs would be, as some critics have said of the film itself, that there is no meaning to it at all.\n\nOddly enough, the only humor that seems to serve an express purpose has little to do with Fleck himself. Two different scenes include dated jokes made at the expense of a little person, which recalls the style of comedy Phillips said he no longer feels able to pursue. Those jokes, at the very least, are Phillips\u2019s way of giving \u201cwoke culture\u201d the brushoff.\n\nWatch more:\n\nRead more:\n\nOur definitive ranking of the Jokers, from Jack Nicholson to Joaquin Phoenix\n\nTalk-show joker Joaquin Phoenix is at it again\n\nIn the \u2018Birds of Prey\u2019 trailer, Harley Quinn is done with the Joker and assembles a whole new squad", "description": "The film's humor seems muddled in the context of the director's comments decrying \"woke culture.\"", "authors": ["Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter", "October At Pm", "Sonia Rao Is A Pop Culture Reporter.
