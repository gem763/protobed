Saints QB Teddy Bridgewater, who replaced starter Drew Brees who is recovering from hand surgery, is 10 of 14 for 87 yards and a touchdown. Not too shabby.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t good enough for Saints fan Donna Brazile. She wants the team to sign Colin Kaepernick instead:\n\nSorry @Saints, but @Kaepernick7 is still available. We need someone who can get the job done while #CoolBrees recover. It\u2019s past time the @NFL allow him to return to the game.#WomenLoveFootball \u2014 Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) September 22, 2019\n\nWhat is she even talking about?\n\nSaints have one of the best backup quarterbacks in football. This is a nonsensical thought. https://t.co/EdcgemHofA \u2014 Brent Scher (@BrentScher) September 22, 2019\n\nThey even used a high draft pick to get him:\n\nThe Saints traded a 2nd round pick for Teddy Bridgewater, who used to be a great starter. This has nothing to do with politics. \u2014 Brent Scher (@BrentScher) September 22, 2019\n\nShe should really stick to her day job helping Dems lose elections, because she\u2019s really good at that:\n\nWe could have three good back ups. I am just looking forward to seeing @Kaepernick7 back in the lineup. Shame on the @NFL for not allowing this talented man to play. My view. Love @Saints \u2014 Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) September 22, 2019\n\nThe Saints will receive the kickoff at the start of the 2nd half and we\u2019ll add an update at the end of the game:\n\nSpecial teams, defense power #Saints to 20-7 halftime lead. Quick first half recap. And Saints get ball to start second half. https://t.co/J6ZdptcdAn \u2014 DougTatum (@DougTatum) September 22, 2019\n\nAnd we\u2019ll see what she has to say after the game:\n\n#GeauxSaints Oh what a relief this is. Half time and the score is 20-7 (Saints vs Seahwks). Stir your red beans and rice. Get a few more cold beers and \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe. \u2014 Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) September 22, 2019\n\n***", "description": "\"The Saints traded a 2nd round pick for Teddy Bridgewater, who used to be a great starter.\"", "authors": ["Greg P.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kaepernick_ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
