It has been a two-tier event, with all the fine-margin drama below the summit.\n\nExeter and Saracens are on course to meet in the final, as they have been for months. They are at home in the play-offs next Saturday against Northampton and Gloucester respectively.\n\nBarring a momentous upset at either Allianz Park or Sandy Park in five days, the league will have its fitting decider at Twickenham on June 1.\n\nJames Lang watches on as his 51-metre penalty falls inches short for Harlequins on Saturday\n\nSaracens finished second in the table but the Chiefs will do well to deny them a domestic and European double.\n\nWith due respect to the standard-bearers, all the intrigue has long been elsewhere, in the squeezed middle and down in the danger zone.\n\nNewcastle fought until the penultimate round before being consigned to the drop, which came as a relief to free-falling Leicester. So the remaining focus was on the scrap for the last play-off place and for Champions Cup qualification.\n\nIt was comic-book chaos. This column argued that the semi-finals create the spectre of injustice at the end of a season when two clubs have been so far ahead of the rest, but there can be no disputing that the system created a box-office climax.\n\nNorthampton and Harlequins swapped places so many times on Saturday. None of the 'as it stands' tables stood for long, on a day when five of the six matches were settled by one score.\n\nThe Saints were losing in Devon but clinging on to fourth, only for Quins to rally late in Coventry and earn a last-minute shot to keep their title ambitions alive another week. James Lang's long-range penalty fell just inches short. The crossbar and the outcome were the height of cruelty.\n\nOnly one point separated Northampton in fourth and seventh-placed Sale \u2014 who would have been in the semi-finals next weekend if Faf de Klerk's late penalty at Bristol in the previous round had gone over, rather than bouncing off a post.\n\nSale would have been in the semi-finals if Faf de Klerk scored a late penalty last weekend\n\nInstead, the Cheshire club may miss out on the Champions Cup after Bath claimed a try two minutes from time at Welford Road to seize a bonus-point win over Leicester which thrust them up to sixth.\n\nAll of this was happening in the shadow of the Exeter-Saracens duopoly, but it didn't dilute the sense of sporting tension. The Premiership has its faults, but dull and predictable it certainly is not.\n\nHarlequins team-mates Alex Dambrandt (right) and Alofa Alofa console each other after defeat\n\nMako Vunipola will be fine. He's not keen on training, so the Saracens prop will see a silver lining in being ruled out for three months with a torn hamstring. England are confident he will be back to full fitness to go to the World Cup and he doesn't have to prove himself in the warm-up matches.\n\nHowever, his injury has highlighted an awkward issue for Eddie Jones. In certain positions, the first choice is clear but the back-up isn't. That is true across the front row. Joe Marler is unlikely to reverse his retirement from Tests, so Jones has Ben Moon, Ellis Genge and Alec Hepburn to pick from.\n\nAt tighthead, Harry Williams has not yet usurped Dan Cole as Kyle Sinckler's understudy. At hooker, Dylan Hartley has been out for months but Luke Cowan-Dickie has left the door open. This issue exists at scrum-half too, where Danny Care, Ben Spencer and Dan Robson are jostling behind Ben Youngs.\n\nMako Vunipola will recover for the World Cup but his injury does reveal issues with the squad\n\nDean Ryan has let rip at the RFU after leaving his post as head of international player development at Twickenham, to take charge of the Dragons in Newport. Speaking to the Sunday Times, he claimed that the union 'do thousands of things \u2014 none very well'.\n\nIn a scathing verdict on the cost-cutting which undermined his department's work, Ryan added: 'There is nothing left, no resources. England will still play Under 20 games but there is nothing behind it. There are no development programmes. We've given it up.'\n\n\n\nHis damning words will rattle new RFU chief executive Bill Sweeney, who has inherited a mess.\n\nBut Ryan's parting shot is also a means of shifting attention. He sacked popular, long-established England Under 18 coaches John Fletcher and Peter Walton \u2014 to the dismay of so many players they had nurtured. That was more about creating his own vision and structure, but now he is gone and there is no vision left and no legacy, just acrimony.\n\nDean Ryan attacked the RFU after leaving his role as head of international player development\n\nHITS AND MISSES\n\nMajor shock\n\nLeicester\u2019s freefall into the relegation zone.\n\nThree new sensations\n\nAlex Dombrandt, Rory Hutchinson and Ruaridh McConnochie.\n\nNew recruit Dombrandt has enjoyed a fine breakthrough campaign at Harlequins\n\nOver-hyped\n\nLima Sopoaga provided fresh proof All Blacks don\u2019t always excel abroad.\n\nFond farewells\n\nMarcelo Bosch, Luther Burrell, James Horwill, Matt Smith and David Strettle.\n\nWage relief\n\nWorcester won\u2019t mind having Ben Te\u2019o off their books, given how rarely he played.\n\nBen Te'o will leave Worcester Warriors after an injury-hit spell with the Premiership club\n\nWelcome return\n\nA proper Gloucester pack \u2014 big, powerful and stroppy.\n\nDisruptive sideshow\n\nElliot Daly spending months denying his move to Saracens.\n\nWasps centre Elliot Daly denied he was moving to Saracens for much of the season\n\nGolden pass\n\nDanny Cipriani\u2019s assist for Charlie Sharples\u2019 try against Northampton.\n\nTop talkers\n\nDai Young for humour in adversity and Joe Marler for on-field wit.\n\nAbrupt exit\n\nChristian Wade started the season at Wasps and ended it with Buffalo Bills in the NFL.\n\nChristian Wade started the season at Wasps and ended it with Buffalo Bills in the NFL\n\nTHE LAST WORD\n\nPremiership Rugby are hell-bent on forcing the RFU to ratify their proposed expansion of the league to 13 teams, with a play-off system to replace the existing automatic promotion and relegation. That is ring-fencing by the back door.\n\nThere is no way the top club in the Championship would have any realistic chance of beating the bottom side in the Premiership before they have embarked on a major recruitment drive.\n\nLondon Irish are coming back up this year. If they had to beat Newcastle this month to confirm their promotion, it wouldn\u2019t happen. But by next season, after investing in their squad, they could be competitive in the elite. This play-off plan aims to make the Premiership a closed shop.", "description": "CHRIS FOY - WORLD OF RUGBY: The last day of the regular season summed up the appeal of the 2018-19 Premiership.
