She added that the move \"will make defending [South] Korea more complicated and increase risk to U.S. forces.\"\n\nEarlier, the U.S. expressed regret when Cheong Wa Dae announced it was scrapping the pact with Japan last Thursday, and said the move will have a negative impact on bilateral security interests.\n\nThe government here said the decision was due to \"broken trust\" between Seoul and Tokyo and cited Japan's exclusion of South Korea from a \"whitelist\" of preferential trade partners.\n\nWashington's warning comes ahead of fresh talks about cost sharing for the upkeep of the U.S. Forces Korea.\n\nBut a Cheong Wa Dae official said, \"There were close consultations with the U.S. shortly before and after the termination of the pact. I believe there is no misunderstanding between the two countries.\"\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump said he believes joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises are a \"complete waste of money.\"\n\n", "description": "U.S. Warns Scrapping Intelligence Pact Threatens American Troops", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-08-27"}
