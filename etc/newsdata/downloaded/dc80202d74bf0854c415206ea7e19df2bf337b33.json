Of course, these rumored plans are thin on details; as with other prior announcements, they may be a kind of horrific trial balloon, to determine how far the administration can go. But even in the weedy, vague statements released so far, familiar outlines emerge. In blaming people in California who are homeless for pollution and crime, and then calling for their removal, the president turns to a ready script, swapping one \u201ccrisis\u201d for another. As the Senate moves to block President Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration on immigration, homelessness may be his new border fight.\n\nEarly reports of some of the plans officials are discussing, including \u201coptions to clear\u201d homeless camps, raise nearly as many questions\u2014is such federal action even legal?\u2014as fears. One senior administration official, speaking to The Washington Post, called the forcible relocation plan \u201cthe stupidest idea I have ever heard.\u201d But as with the president\u2019s immigration rhetoric, policy particulars hardly seem the point. What stands out, instead, is the invention of a new scapegoat, along with a new way to rail against the \u201celite\u201d liberal cities who also give sanctuary to the undocumented.\n\nTrump has already tried to link homeless people and immigrants. While on a flight to San Francisco this month, he told reporters that the homeless \u201ccame from other countries and they moved to Los Angeles or they moved to San Francisco because of the prestige of the city, and all of a sudden they have tents.\u201d If he didn\u2019t act, he said, cities would \u201cdestroy themselves.\u201d\n\nAs with immigration, homelessness is a genuine humanitarian issue: real people facing real suffering. In 2018, more than half a million people experienced homelessness on an average night, the Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates. Nationwide, millions of people are living one paycheck away from such a crisis\u2014and in some cities in California, with which Trump is uniquely fixated, between ten and 13 percent of homeless people are employed. But when Trump speaks of a homelessness \u201ccrisis,\u201d he refers not to the conditions that create homelessness, like sub-living wages or the lack of affordable housing, nor to the experience of homelessness. He focuses, instead, on the harm homelessness allegedly causes others\u2014him, his supporters, housed people who are confronted with homeless people\u2019s existence.", "description": "Trump adapts his \"immigration crisis\" script for homeless Americans.", "authors": ["Melissa Gira Grant"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/858e6197c83028c57cded7b256069e7e1f039350.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
