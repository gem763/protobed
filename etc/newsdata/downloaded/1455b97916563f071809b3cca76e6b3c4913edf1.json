Gwyneth exclaimed as she buried her face in her hands.\n\n'I just got confused!' she insisted. 'There's so many of these wonderful Marvel interconnecting movies, and I thought that it was an Avengers movie, but it was not.'\n\n'Was Spider-Man himself offended by this?' Jimmy asked, referring to Tom Holland.\n\n'I just got confused!' Paltrow completely forgot about appearing in the hit 2017 action film with Jon Favreau and Robert Downey Jr.\n\nWhat!? Jon was flabbergasted Paltrow had forgotten their scene together\n\nMortified: Gwyneth was completely embarrassed when Jimmy brought up the memory lapse\n\nEmbarrassingly, Gwyneth once again admitted she had never even seen the movie.\n\n'I never actually saw the movie,' she said, before backtracking. 'I mean wait, cut that out!'\n\nThe confusion is definitely reasonable, considering Gwyneth has appeared in seven films as Pepper Potts over the years.\n\nDon't remind her! Paltrow buried her face in her hands as Jimmy asked her about the awkward moment\n\nIt was just a few months ago Gwyneth left Jon completely flabbergasted after she insisted she had never been in Spider-Man.\n\nThe actress was a guest on Jon and Roy Choi's The Chef Show back in June, where Jon started to reminisce about their time filming the action movie.\n\n'We're weren't in Spider-Man,' Gwyneth said. 'No, I was in Avengers. What?'\n\n'Remember, Spider-Man at the end, and Tom Holland's there and you're going to walk out and do a press conference? I give you the ring?'\n\nOnce it hit her, she exclaimed, 'Oh yes! That was Spider-Man? Oh my god!'", "description": "The 47-year-old actress has been playing Pepper Potts on a variety of Marvel films since 2008, and insisted on Jimmy Kimmel Live! that she simply for the movies mixed up.", "authors": ["Christine Rendon For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/11/19273844-0-image-a-64_1570185558416.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
