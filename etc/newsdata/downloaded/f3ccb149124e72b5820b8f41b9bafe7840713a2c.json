Why did you expect the UK press to be any different? 4) Do you appreciate the fact that you have more money and opportunity than everyone else? 5) What is Meghan's relationship like with William and Kate and has there ever been a rift between them? 6) Why have you only targeted the British press with legal action when media in the US has also printed stories about you? 7) How do you feel about spending public money on refurbishing Frogmore Cottage? 8) Do you feel the criticism of the way you handled Archie's christening - inviting US media to cover the event and not revealing the names of the godparents - is fair? 9) Why did Meghan not want fans to take any pictures of her when she attended Wimbledon? 10) Was your pledge to only have two children for the environment a criticism of your brother, who has three?\n\nAnd she also revealed her friends warned her not to marry Harry because the media focus would 'destroy your life', as Prince Harry told how he felt pressure to try and 'protect' his family.\n\nBut despite the revelations, viewers took aim at Bradby's interview style, with one saying: 'Way too much fawning Tom. 'Existing and not living.'\n\n'With her patronages, opportunities, and privileges? How insulting. In Africa of all places too.'\n\nAnother said: 'So there's a sudden outpouring of support eh? Well done Tom Bradby. You did what you were paid to do.\n\n'Making a mockery of the purpose of a 'Royal' trip that's everything to do with promoting H&M and nothing to do with Sth Africa.'\n\nA third wrote: ' I felt very sorry for her in that interview. But @tombradby I hear is a personal friend. I think as a journalist you have got to also press on the things they have said. Climate change hypocrisy.'\n\nAnd another said: 'Tom Bradby, you should have asked H&M SEPARATELY: 'Feeling as you do with the media, its scrutiny and recent public sentiments, are and will you willingly give up your Royla Titles, the entitlements, rewards & benefits to live the life as Private Citizens'\n\nThe programme came following months of controversy involving Meghan and Harry, and weeks after they waged war on the media by announcing they were suing the Mail On Sunday for publishing private letters to her father and launched phone hacking claims against The Sun and the Mirror.\n\nBradby speaking to Prince Harry during the documentary last night\n\nThe documentary was praised by many, branding it 'respectful' and 'sensitive'\n\nThe couple invited Bradby, a former ITV royal correspondent - who is a friend and confidante of Prince Harry - to join them on the tour that began last month.\n\nBradby and his wife Claudia (pictured together) were guests at Harry and Meghan's wedding at Windsor Castle in May 2018\n\nBradby was first introduced to Harry by his then private secretary, Mark Dyer, and went on to make a documentary about the prince's gap year in Africa, followed by another revisiting his work in Lesotho in 2016.\n\nSuch is their closeness that Bradby and his wife Claudia were guests at Harry and Meghan's wedding at Windsor Castle in May 2018.\n\nPraising last night's programme one user wrote: 'Just looking at these clips from a journalistic standpoint, @tombradby achieved a major coup.\n\n'He got two people who have captured the world's attention to talk openly to him. This is a modern version of the Diana interview on Panorama.'\n\nAnother said: 'It will take some time to process this documentary but I can honestly say I never though we would have the opportunity to see Harry and Meghan this open and vulnerable. @tombradby thank you for respectfully allowing us insight into their reality, so very grateful.\n\nAnd a third added: Salute to @tombradby for showing kindness to Meghan and Harry.", "description": "The ITN News At Ten host, a friend and confidante of the Duke of Sussex, was\u00a0blasted for his soft touch approach when quizzing the couple about their struggles with the media spotlight.", "authors": ["Ed Riley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/15/19992956-0-image-a-12_1571666630370.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
