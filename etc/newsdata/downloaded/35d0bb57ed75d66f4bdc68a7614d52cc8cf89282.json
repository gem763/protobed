Irish lawmakers sit to oppose abortion reform", "language": "en", "text": "Belfast (AFP) \u2013 A group of Northern Irish lawmakers will return to their parliament on Monday in a last-minute protest at the liberalisation of abortion laws, set to come into force after being decided by London for the suspended Belfast executive.\n\nThe regional government in Belfast collapsed in January 2017 after a scandal over a renewable heating scheme split the power-sharing executive, amid a breakdown in trust.\n\nAbortion is currently illegal in the province, except when the mother\u2019s life is in danger.\n\nWith the Northern Ireland Assembly not sitting, the British government in July passed legislation forcing the province\u2019s laws on abortion and same-sex marriage, which is also illegal, into line with those in the rest of the UK \u2014 unless the executive returns by Monday.\n\nHowever, the return of around 30 of the 90 Northern Ireland Assembly members specifically to discuss abortion law is expected to be symbolic.\n\nThe majority of those appearing at Stormont will be members of the conservative Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), led by Arlene Foster.\n\nBut without cross-party support, a first minister and deputy first minister cannot be elected \u2014 the assembly\u2019s first task \u2014 meaning the law cannot be blocked.\n\nMichelle O\u2019Neill, the left-wing Sinn Fein party\u2019s leader in Northern Ireland, described the event as \u201cstunt politics\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to discuss issues which they can do nothing about. For me, that\u2019s all about being dishonest with the public,\u201d she said Friday.\n\n\u201cWe want to be in the assembly but we need to get the issues resolved that brought the assembly down.\u201d\n\nTrevor Lunn, an assembly member for the centrist cross-community Alliance party called the bid to recall the assembly \u201cshowboating\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt appears those wanting to go back on Monday are only doing so to try and deny LGBTQ people and women the rights guaranteed to them in the rest of the UK,\u201d he said last week.\n\nCelebrations are due in the province to herald the changes in the law.\n\nCampaign group Love Equality said couples and supporters will gather in Belfast ahead of Monday\u2019s midnight deadline.\n\nA mock-wedding event with \u201ca buffet reception, speeches and photo opportunities featuring a wedding cake, flowers and balloons\u201d will take place at lunchtime, the group said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile the Women\u2019s Resource and Development Agency campaign group is also organising a protest at Stormont against the bid to block the new legislation.\n\nPro-life group Both Lives Matter said 31 assembly members have signed the recall petition allowing parliament to sit on Monday.\n\nFoster told the BBC the move will give deputies the opportunity to express opposition to the law changes.\n\n\u201cHopefully we will be able to debate the issue on Monday,\u201d she said.", "description": "Belfast (AFP) \u2013 A group of Northern Irish lawmakers will return to their parliament on Monday in a last-minute protest at the liberalisation of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/9b0853_demonstrators-campaign-change-in-ireland-abortion-laws-london-earlier-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
