When you combine this with heavy traffic and frequent stopping, it is a perfect recipe for vehicle collisions,' Ms Cartwright said.\n\nBehavioural Economist for AAMI, Phil Slade, said car accidents commonly occur when a driver is less than 10km away from their home.\n\n'We are more likely to have accidents when we're less than 10 kilometres from home or on a familiar route because we tend to slip into autopilot,' Mr Slade said.\n\n'When we're driving somewhere we haven't been before, somewhere novel, we're more careful and concentrate more.'\n\n'On the flip side, when drivers are close to home, or on a familiar route, they can get too comfortable, and find themselves daydreaming or getting distracted.'\n\nMr Slade said distractions such as phones and digital devices are big issues as they take away from the ability to react.\n\nIn Perth, the Albany Highway (pictured) got the top spot for the second year in a row\n\nEvery city also has new entrants in their separate top ten, with Sydney's list revealing five new crash hot spots including the M5 Motorway at Liverpool\n\n'It's best to always expect the unexpected, leave plenty of room between you and the vehicle in front and be patient especially if traffic is congested,' he said.\n\nFrustration, impatience and road rage are also factors that contribute to vehicle collisions.\n\n'If you're running late, or if something or someone gets in your way or blocks your journey, even if it has no material impact on how quickly you'll actually arrive at your destination, it's your reactive self that tends to take control of your car, which makes it more difficult to control your emotions and make good decisions,' Mr Slade said.\n\n'Drivers must be patient and present while driving if they want to avoid making an appearance as a statistic on next year's AAMI Crash Index.'", "description": "National insurer AAMI has analysed more than 340,000 car crashes across Australia between July 2018 and June 2019, with most of the worst crash locations situated in Melbourne.", "authors": ["Lauren Ferri For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/12/19784364-0-image-a-35_1571224744726.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
