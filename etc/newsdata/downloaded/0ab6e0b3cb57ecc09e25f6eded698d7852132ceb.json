We flew from Gatwick to Buenos Aires with Norwegian Airlines and they were very attentive and helpful.\"\n\nMeleri claims she is yet to receive any response from the airline to her complaint.\n\n(Image: WALES NEWS SERVICE)\n\nThe airline based in Buenos Aires has so far not responded to a request for a comment.\n\nUK charity Anaphylaxis Campaign say all airlines have different policies in place for keeping passengers with an allergy safe.\n\nA spokesman said: \"We are deeply saddened to hear about the alleged incident on the Aerolinas Argentinas flight.\n\n\"We understand that flying with a food allergy can be stressful and cause much anxiety in those with a severe allergy, as such, we are continuously working with the airline industry to raise awareness of the key issues affecting those at risk of severe allergies whilst travelling and how airlines should best manage these.\n\n\"The Department for Transport has published a consultation on the future of aviation, which proposed the introduction of a passenger charter, a clear set of standards for how airports and airlines treat consumers.\n\n\"Furthermore, the Anaphylaxis Campaign have been involved in meetings with the Aviation Minister, the Civil Aviation Authority, Airlines UK and other key parties to see improved clarity and consistency in how the aviation sector deals with allergies.\"\n\nEarlier this year easyJet banned the sale of nuts on their flights.", "description": "Trainee teacher Meleri Williams was on her way to volunteer at a primary school when she was banned from the plane", "authors": ["Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Wales News Service"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20640889.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-WNS_171019_Nut_Allergy_Plane_Eject_03JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
