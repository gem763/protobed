The 50-year veteran of government service systematically dismantled Trump\u2019s repeated denials that he sought to leverage American military and diplomatic might to coerce an ally into a coordinated campaign to damage his potential 2020 rival. Trump himself and his congressional allies did not attempt on Tuesday to dispute the substance of Taylor\u2019s claims, which were based on copious notes. Instead, the White House attacked Taylor personally, saying he was part of a band of \u201cradical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution.\u201d\n\nIn his opening statement, Taylor said Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, told him that \u201ceverything\u201d \u2014 including military assistance to Ukraine and a meeting between Trump and the Ukrainian leader \u2014 was contingent on the Ukrainians publicly announcing investigations into Trump\u2019s political opponents. He told impeachment investigators that a White House budget official said on a secure phone call in July that Trump had personally directed that the military aid be withheld.\n\n\u201cIt is a rancorous story about whistle-blowers, Mr. Giuliani, side channels, quid pro quos, corruption and interference in elections,\u201d Taylor said, referring to Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who was deeply involved in the shadow effort.\n\nTaylor also testified that Sondland said Trump personally told him that he wanted Ukraine to \u201cstate publicly\u201d that it would open such probes, before the U.S. would release the aid, which is viewed as critical for combating Russia\u2019s aggression in the region. Taylor repeatedly underscored the damage that even a temporary hold on the aid had done to the U.S.-Ukraine relationship, at a time when the budding democracy was resisting an advance by Russian forces and fighting corruption at the highest levels of the government.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland tried to explain to me that President Trump is a businessman. When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, he said, the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check,\u201d Taylor said, according to his opening statement.\n\nTaylor\u2019s testimony described the intensity of the efforts among Trump\u2019s allies to persuade Ukrainian officials to launch an investigation targeting former Vice President Joe Biden and another probe centering on a debunked conspiracy theory regarding the 2016 election.\n\nTaylor prompted sighs and gasps inside the secure hearing room when he read his lengthy, 15-page opening statement, two of the sources said. Democrats who emerged from the deposition said the revelations could speed up their impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cThe body language of the people hearing it was, \u2018holy s---\u2019 \u2014 seriously,\u201d Representative Harley Rouda (Democrat-California), a member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said in reference to Taylor\u2019s opening statement.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said there was no quid pro quo, claiming Trump is the victim of a \u201ccoordinated smear campaign\u201d by Democrats.\n\nRepresentative Stephen Lynch (Democrat-Massachusetts), a senior member of the Oversight panel, characterized the testimony as a \u201csea change\u201d that \u201ccould accelerate\u201d the impeachment inquiry. Another lawmaker, Democratic Representative Tom Malinowski of New Jersey, said it was \u201cthe most thorough accounting we\u2019ve had of the timeline.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, as a former State Department political appointee, in my experience the difference between career folks and political appointees is the career folks take very good notes,\u201d Malinowski said, hinting that Taylor provided corroboration to back up his recollections. Lawmakers roundly criticized Sondland, a political appointee and a donor to the 2016 Trump campaign, for failing to recall certain events and conversations during his deposition last week.\n\nSondland\u2019s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. Sondland has emphasized that he wants to provide notes and documents to the committee but has been blocked by the State Department.\n\nCongressional Republicans were more muted, but they showed no immediate signs of breaking with Trump despite the latest bombshells.\n\nRepresentative Jim Jordan (Republican-Ohio), the president's lead defender in the room, was tight-lipped as he emerged from the closed-door deposition for a lunch break. He praised what he described as GOP lawyers\u2019 effective questioning of Taylor but declined to say whether it yielded exculpatory information.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said there was no quid pro quo, claiming Trump is the victim of a \u201ccoordinated smear campaign\u201d by Democrats.\n\n\u201cToday was just more triple hearsay and selective leaks from the Democrats\u2019 politically-motivated, closed door, secretive hearings,\u201d Grisham said in a statement. \u201cEvery day this nonsense continues more taxpayer time and money is wasted.\u201d\n\nWeeks before Taylor testified, it emerged that he had deep concerns that Trump was possibly withholding military aid to pressure Ukrainian leaders to launch the investigations.\n\nTrump, who urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden in a July 25 phone call, has long denied the charge that military assistance was used as leverage to bend Zelenskiy to his will.\n\nWeeks before Taylor testified, it emerged that he had deep concerns that Trump was possibly withholding military aid to the eastern European nation to pressure Ukrainian leaders to launch the investigations \u2014 one of which centers on an unsubstantiated claim about the origins of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election.\n\nTaylor, who replaced U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch after her unceremonious ouster by Trump in May, raised alarms with colleagues on September 1 in a text message exchange released earlier this month by the three committees spearheading the inquiry.\n\n\u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and [White House] meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d he wondered, referring to a potential meeting between Trump and Zelenskiy.\n\nEight days later, Taylor\u2019s concerns grew more urgent. In texts to two other diplomats, Taylor said it was \u201ccrazy\u201d that military aid to Kyiv was being blocked in order to force \u201chelp with a political campaign.\u201d Nearly $400 million in military assistance to Ukraine was put on hold in late July by the White House but was released in September two weeks after POLITICO revealed that it had been frozen. Taylor described the hold on aid as a \u201cnightmare\u201d and said it had already shaken Ukraine\u2019s faith in the United States.\n\n\u201cThe Russians love it. (And I quit.),\u201d Taylor said of the prospect that the aid would be blocked even after Ukraine agreed to open Trump\u2019s preferred investigations.\n\nA source who attended the deposition said a phone call between Taylor and Sondland was a key episode about which Taylor provided new information. That conversation came at Sondland\u2019s request after Taylor, in one of the text messages released earlier this month, questioned whether the military assistance and possible White House meeting are \u201cconditioned on investigations.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter today, Mr. Sondland is going to have some explaining to do,\u201d Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi (Democrat-Illinois) said.\n\nAt least one Democrat, Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, said Taylor should testify in public. Democrats have been gathering evidence behind closed doors in the five weeks since Speaker Nancy Pelosi formalized the impeachment inquiry, drawing scorn from Republicans who say the process should be conducted in the open.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the inquiry, issued a subpoena to Taylor early Tuesday morning, according to an official, because the State Department tried to block Taylor from appearing. The official also cited \u201cefforts by the State Department to also limit any testimony that does occur,\u201d adding that Taylor was complying with the subpoena.\n\nOther State Department officials have spoken with investigators under subpoena after the State Department and White House sought to block them from appearing \u2014 a sign that the White House\u2019s stranglehold on testimony has begun to slip.\n\nTaylor\u2019s lengthy diplomatic service occurred under Republican and Democratic presidents. He served as ambassador to Ukraine under George W. Bush and Barack Obama from 2006 to 2009. Before that, he held numerous diplomatic posts in the Middle East, advised the U.S. ambassador to NATO and worked on Capitol Hill for former Sen. Bill Bradley. He graduated from West Point and served in Vietnam.\n\nTaylor had left government service for a senior position at the U.S. Institute of Peace but returned to the diplomatic corps in June after Yovanovitch\u2019s ouster. She testified to lawmakers earlier this month that her removal was the result of a smear campaign engineered by Trump allies who portrayed her as disloyal for rebuffing Giuliani\u2019s mission in Ukraine.\n\nTaylor\u2019s two correspondents in the text exchanges \u2014 Sondland and former Ambassador Kurt Volker \u2014 have already testified to impeachment investigators. They painted a portrait of a foreign policy that had been outsourced by Trump to Giuliani. Both described deep discomfort with the arrangement and worried that Giuliani\u2019s freelancing \u2014 especially in a country fending off Russian aggression and battling systemic internal corruption \u2014 could undermine America\u2019s yearslong diplomatic efforts.\n\nTaylor voiced those concerns in a July text exchange days before Trump called Zelenskiy, who was elected in the spring on a platform of fighting corruption.\n\n\u201cGordon, one thing Kurt and I talked about yesterday was Sasha Danyliuk\u2019s point that President Zelenskiy is sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics,\u201d he said. Danyliuk is likely a reference to Oleksandr Danyliuk, Ukraine\u2019s former finance minister.\n\nSondland replied, \u201cAbsolutely, but we need to get the conversation started and the relationship built, irrespective of the pretext. I am worried about the alternative.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump canceled a late August trip to Poland, where he was to meet Zelenskiy, the ambassadors again fretted about building a relationship between Trump and Zelenskiy. Volker said he hoped Vice President Mike Pence would attend in Trump\u2019s place and set up a White House visit for Zelenskiy. He also said he hoped Energy Secretary Rick Perry would join.\n\nBut Taylor, on September 1, worried that the White House visit itself would be conditioned on Trump\u2019s demand for Ukraine to investigate Biden as well as an unfounded conspiracy theory that Ukraine \u2014 not Russia \u2014 interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nAs Taylor\u2019s concerns about a quid pro quo grew more explicit, Sondland sought to put him at ease.\n\n\u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d Sondland texted on September 9, urging his colleagues to stop the text message exchanges.\n\nLast week, Sondland told House investigators that he sent this message after speaking directly to Trump and that he could not speak to whether it was true.\n\nLaura Barr\u00f2n-Lopez and John Bresnahan contributed to this report.", "description": "William Taylor says Gordon Sondland told him \u2018everything\u2019 was contingent on Ukrainians announcing investigations into Trump\u2019s political opponents.", "authors": ["Andrew Desiderio", "Kyle Cheney", "David M.
