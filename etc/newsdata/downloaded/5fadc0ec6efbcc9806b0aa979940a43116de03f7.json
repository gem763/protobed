Calhoun to serve as non-executive chairman, the company said in a statement.\n\n\"The board said splitting the chairman and CEO roles will enable Muilenburg to focus full time on running the company as it works to return the 737 MAX safely to service, ensure full support to Boeing's customers around the world, and implement changes to sharpen Boeing's focus on product and services safety,\" the statement said.\n\nThe board's move to split the CEO and chairman roles came the same day as a new report from the Joint Authorities Technical Review faulted both the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing for failures in the overall certification of the 737 Max.\n\nTesla TSLA The chairman position is a non-executive position, running the board meetings and communicating with shareholders.
