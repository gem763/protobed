We think there is some demand for that. It is something we'd very seriously consider for next year.\"\n\nMnunchin's comments come a day after President Donald Trump tweeted that he thinks the U.S. should look at \"refinancing\" is debt load, which has recently eclipsed the $22.5 trillion mark.\n\nThough it's unlikely the government could engage in that process the way a homeowner would refinance a mortgage, Treasury could extend the maturity of the debt by issuing longer-term bonds. The longest duration the government has now is the 30-year bond.\n\nThe Treasury secretary said one of the objectives would be to widen the yield spread against the 30-year bond. That might help revert a trend in which some -term government debt is yielding more than longer-duration notes, a phenomenon called an inverted yield curve that has been a reliable recession indicator over the past 50 years.\n\n\"We would do this in a way that if there is demand it's something that we would meet. I personally think it would be a good thing to expand the U.S.' borrowing capabilities,\" Mnuchin said. \"I would say it's obviously quite attractive for us to extend and de-risk the U.S. Treasury borrowing. So we're also looking at extending the weighted average maturity of the Treasury borrowing to de-risk this for the U.S. people.\"\n\nAs Mnuchin spoke to CNBC, Trump weighed in again on his desire for a weaker dollar and renewed his continuing criticisms of the Federal Reserve.\n\nThis is a developing news story.", "description": "The U.S. could be issuing 50-year bonds as soon as next year as the government looks for cheaper and longer-term ways to finance its burgeoning debt load, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday", "authors": ["Jeff Cox"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106119706-1568046211547rts2pukr.jpg?v=1568046281", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
