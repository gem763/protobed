It is with the deepest regret that we inform you that \u201clater in the year\u201d is \u201ctoday,\u201d and thus at the stroke of midnight tonight the talking clock service will fall silent, ending a millisecond-precise service that\u2019s been operating consistently for some 66 years.\n\nSeptember 30th marks the final day of operation for George, with the 1194 number to be discontinued at the stroke of midnight on October 1st.\n\nThe service was originally scheduled to disappear on July 30th, but Telstra officials gave it a three-month extension in order for consumers to \u201cfind an alternative solution\u201d to the Talking Clock.\n\nAt the time of the original shutdown announcement, Telstra officials stated that removing the service was like \u201cany time you upgrade to radically new technology,\u201d in that \u201csometimes older services wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s like] with software, if you\u2019re trying to use Microsoft Word 95 with the latest operating system, Windows 10. Or with iPhone 3, you won\u2019t see those products working with the latest iPhone software. It\u2019s not compatible.\u201d\n\nIronically enough, the service was still attracting around 2 million calls per year, according to its operating company Informatel.\n\nShutting the clock down mere days before Daylight Savings kicks in is also a bold call, given that\u2019s traditionally when the service received its highest volume of calls.\n\nRIP Talking Clock. Third stroking its way up to the pearly gates of tech heaven.", "description": "Today marks the final day of operation for the iconic Talking Clock, which ceases operations at midnight after 66 years in service.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/telstra-clock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
