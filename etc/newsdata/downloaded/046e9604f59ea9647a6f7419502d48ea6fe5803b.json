Some Democrats, however, privately fretted that the rollout of that resolution unintentionally played into the GOP\u2019s hands and overshadowed other events this week, including damning new testimony from a White House official (more on that later.) But first \u2026 here is some of the guidance outlined by the impeachment resolution:\n\n\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee will be in charge of the public hearings.\n\nChairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) can add longer rounds of questioning for himself and ranking member Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), followed by the usual five-minute rounds for members. Both Schiff and Nunes may yield their questioning time to staffers.\n\nSchiff is authorized to publicly release the transcripts from their previous closed-door depositions with impeachment witnesses, with redactions where necessary for classified information.\n\nRepublicans may request to call witnesses (which is technically already permitted under House rules) and issue subpoenas. In both cases, though, the requests are subject to a veto by Schiff and committee Democrats.\n\nTrump and his counsel are allowed to attend all Judiciary Committee hearings. Trump\u2019s lawyers can cross-examine witnesses and make closing presentations during proceedings. The president\u2019s counsel can also lodge objections during testimony. But that\u2019s all subject to Democrats\u2019 discretion.\n\nOn timing: Later today, Democrats will prep the resolution for floor debate, with a floor vote expected on Thursday.

Alexander Vindman, a top National Security Council official and Iraq war veteran, testified for 10 hours yesterday during a closed-door deposition with impeachment investigators. He is considered a crucial, first-hand witness, having been on the infamous July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine. Here are some of the takeaways:\n\n\u2014 Vindman said the White House\u2019s transcript of the call omitted crucial words and phrases and he unsuccessfully sought to correct it, report the NYT\u2019s Julian E. Barnes, Nicholas Fandos and Danny Hakim: https://nyti.ms/2C0yxrf .\n\n\u2014 Vindman\u2019s testimony appears to contradict Rick Perry's repeated denials that he never heard the Bidens discussed as part of pressure campaign on Ukraine, per Ben Lefebvre and Natasha Bertrand: https://politi.co/2q7OXvf .\n\n\u2014 Democratic lawmakers accused Republicans of using the closed-door deposition to learn the name of the whistleblower, who Trump\u2019s GOP allies believe should be interviewed and publicly identified.

Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) is currently collecting signatures for a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi requesting that each member be required to stand up and announce their vote on the floor, a dramatic display that is typically only done when selecting a speaker.\n\nWhile they don\u2019t have much power in the minority, Republicans want to at least publicly argue their case during the House Rules Committee meeting today and floor debate. The GOP tried to pull a similar move for the passage of Obamacare.\n\nRelated: \u201cPelosi, Schiff Prep for GOP Impeachment \u2018Stunts\u2019 and Attempts to Out the Whistleblower,\u201d from The Daily Beast's Betsy Swan, Erin Banco, Sam Brodey, Sam Stein: http://bit.ly/2Pw1sf5 ; and \u201cRon Johnson says his involvement in Ukraine will not cause him to recuse himself from a Senate impeachment trial,\u201d via Craig Gilbert and Christal Hayes of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel/USA TODAY: http://bit.ly/2NBP3DR .\n\nRETIREMENT REVERSAL? -- GOP Rep. John Shimkus is reconsidering his decision to retire now that the top Republican spot on the Energy and Commerce Committee will soon be up for grabs. He also said lawmakers on the Hill and in his southeastern Illinois district have asked him to stick around. \u201cIt\u2019s true, I am at least reconsidering,\u201d he told reporters. That would surely be welcome news for a party that\u2019s faced a string of high-profile retirements this year.\n\nAnd if Shimkus threw his hat into the ring for the E&C post, he would likely be an immediate front-runner, given his seniority status and ties to leadership. But the senior lawmaker, who represents a district where 70 percent of voters went for Trump, could face challenges in a primary: just last month, he said he took his name off the \u201cI support Donald Trump list\u201d because of the Syria pullout. Now, Shimkus is trying to downplay their disagreements.

Among the officials who will brief the senators are Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, Commander of U.S. Central Command Gen. Kenneth McKenzie Jr., Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Special Representative for Syria Ambassador James Jeffrey, and Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\nMeanwhile, the House passed a bipartisan bill to impose sanctions on Turkey for its invasion of Syria, in another big rebuke of Trump for pulling troops from the region. The final vote tally was 403 to 16, with 15 Republicans and one Democrat, Rep. Ilhan Omar (Minn.), voting against the legislation.

Katie Hill (D-Calif.): George Papadopoulos. The former Trump aide, who helped set in motion the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, has officially filed to run. \u201cI\u2019m smelling blood in the water now that Katie Hill has resigned. California\u2019s 25th congressional district is wide open for the taking\u201d he tweeted earlier. \u201cSomeone has to step up. I love my state too much to see it run down by candidates like Hill. All talk, no action, and a bunch of sell outs.\u201d\n\nBut Papadopoulos doesn\u2019t even live in the district, though he is not required to do so. He also served time for making false statements to the FBI. And the field is already crowded, with former GOP Rep. Steve Knight also interested in trying to win back his seat.
