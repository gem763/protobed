The trader, who is expecting a delivery of a Saudi diesel cargo at the end of the month, said they have not yet heard any notifications of changes from Aramco.\n\nAn ATC official declined to comment on the matter.\n\n\u201cTightness in ultra low sulfur diesel will be magnified especially since the new Saudi export refineries produce 40 to 45% low sulfur diesel,\u201d Gary Ross founder of Black Gold Investors, told Reuters.", "description": "Saudi Aramco's trading arm is looking for oil products for prompt delivery following Saturday's attacks on Saudi oil facilities, three trade sources said on Monday.", "authors": ["Jessica Jaganathan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
