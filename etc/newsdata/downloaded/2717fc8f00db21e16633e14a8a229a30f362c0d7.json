However, it\u2019s been slowly leaking out that the Kurds were precisely the reason U.S. special forces who took out Baghdadi knew he was where he was. Some of that information came in the form of some dirty underwear, stolen by a Kurdish spy, that ultimately provided the DNA that led to confirmation of his whereabouts.\n\nFox News reports that, in a debriefing held just days after the United States\u2019 most wanted terrorist blew himself up in a daring raid by U.S. Special Forces, Kurdish forces revealed that they were instrumental in tracking and keeping tabs on al-Baghdadi, even though the terror leader moved frequently and was due to depart his Idlib, Syria, safehouse any day. \u2026 \u201cBefore al-Baghdadi could move, a Kurdish undercover operative was able to reach him and retrieve the self-styled \u2018Caliph\u2019s\u2019 underwear,\u201d according to Fox News. \u201cThrough a DNA test, he said they were able to confirm \u2018100%\u2019 that the person of interest was al-Baghdadi.\u201d\n\nWhile the tale of the dirty knickers is as yet unconfirmed by U.S. sources, the Trump administration has credited Kurdish forces for their help in neutralizing the terrorist leader.\n\nFacial recognition was also used to identify the ISIS leader following the blast because his head was reportedly intact.", "description": "The Story Of How Baghdadi\u2019s Location Was Confirmed Is Gross But Also Amazing", "authors": ["Sarah Lee", "Nick Arama", "Kira Davis", "Alex Parker", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Brandon Morse", "Sister Toldjah", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Portrait-of-Abu-Bakr-al-Baghdadi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
