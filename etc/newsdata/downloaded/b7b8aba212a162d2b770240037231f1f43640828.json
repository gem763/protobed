It's the best clickbait in the world: someone is spying on us.\n\n'Eddie didn't say it was us. He was very deliberate in not doing that. He talked about it being someone else, probably the same bloke who videoed us when we were there.\n\n'But everyone has jumped on it and got the clickbait going. He didn't make anything up. He was very particular about what he said and it was that someone filmed their training.\n\nHansen on the training ground with his players ahead of Saturday's showdown with England\n\nPatrick Tuipulotu has been named on the bench for Saturday's game in Yokohama\n\nNew Zealand's players were put through their paces during training drills before the match\n\nHansen and his coaching team have a discussion at Tatsuminomori Rugby Field in Tokyo\n\nAll Blacks team Beauden Barrett, Sevu Reece, Jack Goodhue, Anton Lienert-Brown, George Bridge, Richie Mo'unga, Aaron Smith, Kieran Read (c), Ardie Savea, Scott Barrett, Sam Whitelock, Brodie Retallick, Nepo Laulala, Codie Taylor, Joe Moody. Reserves: Dane Coles, Ofa Tuungafasi, Angus Ta'avao, Patrick Tuipulotu, Sam Cane, TJ Perenara, Sonny Bill Williams, Jordie Barrett.\n\n'He added at the back end of that it could have been a supporter. He didn't say that New Zealand did it. You guys all did. So it's been very clever. It's a mind game only if you buy into it.\n\n'As I said it's allowed us to have a good laugh. We're not buying into it. As I said we have had a good laugh. I got a text from him saying, 'how's it going?' I replied, 'Good thanks Eddie.' I'm laughing.'\n\nHansen scheduled his press conference in Tokyo five hours before Jones was due to speak.\n\nHe announced a tweaked starting line-up for the knockout match, with lineout option Scott Barrett replacing Sam Cane at flanker.\n\nSaturday's Test will be the first time the two sides have met in a World Cup knockout match since 1995.\n\nScott Barrett (left) has been promoted to the New Zealand XV for the semi-final with England\n\nBeauden Barrett will take his place at full-back once again for the All Blacks\n\nNew Zealand are seeking an historic third successive Rugby World Cup trophy\n\nCaptain Kieran Read (right) is playing in his last tournament before international retirement\n\nIt is also England's first World Cup semi-final since 2007 - and Hansen hopes his side's previous experience will work in their favour.\n\n'Eddie is trying to take pressure off his own side by getting you guys to talk about pressure on us,' said Hansen. 'But I'm not buying into it. Our players aren't buying into it. We're always under pressure and Eddie doesn't need to tell us that.\n\n'What he needs to work out is the pressure England are under because they will have memories of the tournament from four years ago where it didn't go that good.\n\n'They will be under immense pressure themselves. For him to say they have nothing to lose, Eddie doesn't believe that either.\n\n'They have had four years of work resulting on one outcome. I have talked about pressure since I have been All Blacks' coach. Early in our history we ran away from it.\n\n'These days we acknowledge it's there. We get it every game. There is pressure, it's a big game and it doesn't matter if it's a quarter-final, semi-final or a test match. There is pressure but it would be very naive not to acknowledge for it to be on both sides.'", "description": "NIK SIMON IN TOKYO: All Blacks coach Steve Hansen dismissed English accusations of spying as 'clickbait' and revealed he had 'a bit of a giggle' about it in a text exchange with Eddie Jones.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/12/20127882-0-image-a-39_1571914878708.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
