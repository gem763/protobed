Indeed, how many leaders do we want to lose to it?'' he said.\n\nFederal Energy Minister Angus Taylor welcomed Mr Fitzgibbon's support for the Coalition's policy.\n\n\"We we would love Labor to support our policy,\" he told the summit. \"They are clearly recognising the error of their ways.''\n\nBut later in the day, opposition climate and energy spokesman Mark Butler slapped down Mr Fitzgibbon's idea, telling Guardian Australia it would be inconsistent with the Paris agreement.\n\n\"It would lead to global warming of more than three degrees and, for that reason, Labor cannot support that target,'' he said. \"That has been a consistent position of ours since we first took advice about what Tony Abbott\u2019s target would mean for climate change.''\n\nMr Taylor said Mr Fitzgibbon\u2019s comments reflected how divided the Labor Party is on energy and climate policy as opposed to the government, which took a detailed policy to the last election.\n\nEnergy Minister Angus Taylor says Labor is divided on energy policy. Louie Douvis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Taylor also criticised Victoria's renewable energy target, describing such state government policies as \"extraordinary distortions\" of the national market.\n\nBut Ms D\u2019Ambrosio said Victoria\u2019s ambitious policies were providing the investor certainty not found in other states, which is why it had attracted 43 per cent of the nation\u2019s total new energy project investment.\n\nShe said the energy market had reached a point where it needed more intervention from all governments and the energy debate should not be seen through an ideological prism.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t simply protect existing interests,\u201d she said. \u201cThe current rules are designed for a different era but the energy market operator seems to just back the status quo.\n\n\"Every day we spend waiting is another day that the issues of reliability, security and affordability become more acute.\u201d\n\nMs D\u2019Ambrosio said it had been a year since state and federal energy ministers last met, with the next Council of Australian Government energy council meeting scheduled for next month.\n\n\"For me, November 22 cannot come fast enough,\" she said.\n\nMs D\u2019Ambrosio said the Victorian Labor government wanted to work with the Commonwealth to secure more energy supply and build a transmission network of the future. But the federal government must first create a system that provided the right combination of investment and rule changes to ensure the nation\u2019s future energy readiness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also said the Victorian government\u2019s ban on fracking would stay in place while the science \u201cis still out\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are very clear on our policy decision around fracking as we don\u2019t believe there is sufficient confidence in the science to give farmers the certainty they need [about] what the impact will be on water supply,'' she said.\n\nMs D'Ambrosio could not see a pressing need to access Victoria\u2019s unconventional gas reserves because Australia had sufficient gas but allowed \u201ctoo much of it to be exported\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has the mechanisms and authority to tackle the challenge of domestic gas shortages, but it needs to consider the amount of gas allowed to be exported so there are sufficient supplies available domestically,\u201d she said.", "description": "ALP frontbencher Joel Fitzgibbon's comments on emissions targets suggest the federal opposition might be in search of a new climate policy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6d5f5b1508e424858563e0e525aaab3e5cc04c5b", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
