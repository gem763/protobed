Now, thanks to Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino, we know why.\n\nWriting for The Federalist, Hemingway and Severino report Ford's father actually backed Kavanaugh's nomination.\n\n\"Within days of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court, a fascinating encounter took place. Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s father was approached by Ford\u2019s father at the golf club where they are both members,\" they report. \"Ralph Blasey, Ford\u2019s father, went out of his way to offer to Ed Kavanaugh his support of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court, according to multiple people familiar with the conversation that took place at Burning Tree Club in Bethesda, Maryland. 'I\u2019m glad Brett was confirmed,' Ralph Blasey told Ed Kavanaugh, shaking his hand. Blasey added that the ordeal had been tough for both families.\"\n\nI'm glad Brett was confirmed.\n\nThis news comes on the heels of new video showing Ford's attorney admitting that protecting abortion was one of the main drivers behind her testimony and accusations against Kavanaugh.\n\nChristine Ford's lawyer Debra Katz says putting \"an asterisk\" next to Kavanaugh's name in case Kavanaugh attacked Roe v. Wade \"is part of what motivated Christine.\" pic.twitter.com/zoFr2T8Aec \u2014 Mary Margaret Olohan (@MaryMargOlohan) September 4, 2019\n\nAs a reminder, the Senate Judiciary Committee produced a lengthy report after Kavanaugh's confirmation and a thorough investigation. The report found not a single accusation against him had evidence or merit.\n\n\"After an extensive investigation that included the thorough review of all potentially credible evidence submitted and interviews of more than 40 individuals with information relating to the allegations, including classmates and friends of all those involved, Committee investigators found no witness who could provide any verifiable evidence to support any of the allegations brought against Justice Kavanaugh,\" the report states. \"In other words, following the separate and extensive investigations by both the Committee and the FBI, there was no evidence to substantiate any of the claims of sexual assault made against Justice Kavanaugh.\"", "description": ".10/02/2019 12:30:11PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/270/a25b97e2-7005-4381-8ce3-7369a5f3e278.jpg"}
