'It would have to be a very serious relationship.'\n\nThere's mommy! The OC vet shares daughter Briar Rose with ex and fellow actor Hayden Christensen, 38\n\nThough still has yet to acquaint her dates with little Briar, she still makes the little girl a focal point of conversation.\n\n'I always put it out there,' she said. 'She\u2019s my world and I talk about her all the time anyways. How f***ed up would it be if I hid that? \u2026 If you\u2019re going to pursue something with someone, they have to be interested in the kid or be willing to be around the kid or babysit the kid \u2026 all the things.'\n\nAnd anyone who fails to ask about Bilson's daughter will get themselves marked off her list.\n\nWay back when: She revealed that she hasn't introduced anyone to her daughter yet since splitting with Christensen in 2017\n\n'I was talking to this guy a few months back,' she said. 'Anytime I would bring my daughter up, [he] would never pursue the question or ask more about her.\n\n'It was a red flag because anyone that you\u2019re going to get involved with, if you have a kid, they have to be all about the kid.'\n\nShe also gushed over a special privilege that kids provide when it comes to breaking plans.\n\n'Kids are great for an excuse for anything,' she said. 'If you don\u2019t want to do something, you don\u2019t ever have to lie because like you have kids.'\n\n'You can leave early, you can not go and you can go to bed at 9 and it\u2019s awesome.'", "description": "She's a mom-of-one.\u00a0But Rachel Bilson had the night off on Monday as she attended the 5th Annual InStyle Awards in a chest-baring floral dress with a dazzling fringed skirt at the Getty Center in", "authors": ["Marisa Okano For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/04/20018512-0-image-a-109_1571716241225.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
