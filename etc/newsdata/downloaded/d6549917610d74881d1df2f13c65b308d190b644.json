However, last month he was diagnosed with terminal cancer.\n\nThe dad-of-six first met Laura when the pair were teenagers, but fell out of contact. They later reunited and began dating in their late 20s, after having children with other partners.\n\nThe pair were forced to change their wedding plans after Gary\u2019s diagnosis, in order to fulfill the groom\u2019s wish of dying a married man.\n\nThe couple said their vows in hospital with 25 guests gathered around the groom\u2019s bed. The wedding food was an impromptu buffet organised by hospital staff.\n\nREAD MORE: Woman with rare cancer type left looking nine months pregnant\n\nLaura, who has one daughter from a previous relationship, said: \u201cAfter Gary was diagnosed with terminal cancer he told me he wanted to die a married man.\n\n\u201cWe thought we might have more time together but it wasn\u2019t to be.
