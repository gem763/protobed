The world's most legendary leaders, from Elon Musk and Oprah Winfrey to CEOs at Google and Facebook, all view success as a work in progress. They key is to stay patient and committed. Here are six things you need to do on a daily basis if you want to be successful in life:\n\n1. Read a book that isn't directly related to your career\n\nReading is one of the easiest ways to experience life from another perspective and develop the empathy required to be an effective leader. But it's important to expand your knowledge beyond your expertise. There's a reason why Elon Musk includes works of science fiction and biographies as some of the essentials on his reading list. \"I was raised by books. Books, and then my parents,\" Musk said in an interview with Rolling Stone.\n\n2. Get sweaty\n\nNo, we're not talking about going to the sauna or doing hot yoga. Developing the courage to do something outside of your comfort zone is a sign that you're leveling up. Otherwise, you won't get very far in life. If you hate public speaking, be the first to speak at your next team meeting. Although you might get so nervous that you end up with sweat stains beneath your armpit sleeves, just do it anyway. It'll get easier. Mark Zuckerberg spent years learning Mandarin. And guess what? He did a pretty good job mastering it. Fear and growth cannot exist in the same space. One has to leave in order for the other to flourish.\n\n3. Exercise\n\nIn his five-year study of rich people, author Tom Corley found that exercising was something they all had in common. \"Those who have forged the habit of exercising aerobically have tremendous competitive advantages over those who don't,\" he wrote in his blog. Those advantages include higher IQ (intelligence quotient), willpower, confidence and up to 20 percent more energy. A number of self-made billionaires, including Oprah Winfrey, Sheryl Sanberg and Richard Branson, incorporate exercise into their daily routines. Research even found that small amounts of daily exercise can significantly help to extend your life.\n\n4. Give back\n\nThe myth that the lone hero succeeded because they managed to pull themselves up by the bootstraps is just that \u2014 a myth. Truly successful people understand the importance of giving back, especially to those in need. In 2010, Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett started the Giving Pledge, a commitment by wealthy individuals and families to give away more than half their fortune to causes like poverty alleviation and global health. But it doesn't have to be massive amounts of money. It can be as simple as offering to help an overworked colleague or an elderly person with their grocery bags. If you're too busy to give back or return a favor, then you're too busy to succeed.\n\n5. Take a moment to remember your competition\n\nMichael Jordan once said, \"I play to win, whether during practice or a real game. And I will not let anything get in the way of me and my competitive enthusiasm to win.\" The professional basketball player went from getting cut from his high school basketball team all the way to six championships and creating one of the most valuable athletic brands in history.\n\nI will not let anything get in the way of me and my competitive enthusiasm to win. Michael Jordan\n\nFailing to forgive and holding grudges can weigh you down, but acknowledging your competition and doubters (a.k.a. the haters) can be a powerful form of motivation. It pushes you to do everything in your power to succeed and prove them wrong.\n\n6.
