(UNP) . The stock has declined the past five months but could be getting ready for an upside reversal.\n\nLet's check out the charts and indicators.\n\nIn the updated daily bar chart of UNP, below, we can see that prices have broken down below the rising 200-day moving average line but have rebounded to the upside the past two weeks. Prices could fail at the underside of the declining 50-day moving average line or at the underside of the 200-day line around $166 or so but a better-than-expected earnings report could propel prices above both of these moving averages.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been in a sideways pattern all year but a new move higher may have begun two weeks ago. The trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator just crossed to the upside from below the zero line for a cover shorts buy signal.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of UNP, below, we can see that prices are below the rising 40-week moving average line. We can see that prices were below the line in the fourth quarter of 2018 but eventually rallied back above the line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has been moving sideways near its high for several months so I take this as a positive sign that traders have not switched to an aggressive seller mode or a downtrend in the OBV line. The MACD oscillator is narrowing and could soon cross to the upside for a cover shorts buy signal and maybe an outright buy signal.\n\nIn this weekly close only Point and Figure chart of UNP, below, we can see a modest downside price target being projected. A rally to $170.07 will turn the chart bullish.\n\nBottom-line strategy: The long-term trend of UNP has been up and the decline in price over the past five months could be considered just a correction in an ongoing bull move. Traders could go long UNP at current levels risking a close below $154. Add to longs on strength above $166 and $171.", "description": "Technical analysis and trading strategy on Union Pacific (UNP) stock....UNP", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Union Pacific'S Correction Is Ending", "Here'S When To Hop On Board.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Ed Ponsi", "James", "Rev Shark", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/408a24e0-134f-11e9-8a3b-e7adc95545a1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
