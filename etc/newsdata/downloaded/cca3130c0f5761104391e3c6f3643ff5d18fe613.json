This year, the men sought the removal of Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, whom they saw as an obstacle to their scheme to change the management of Ukraine\u2019s state energy company and strike a deal to sell it liquefied natural gas.\n\nMessrs. Parnas and Fruman were working with Mr. Trump\u2019s attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and connected him to two corrupt Ukrainian prosecutors, one of whom made false charges against Ms. Yovanovitch. The result was the abrupt recall of the ambassador, who told Congress last week that she had been yanked on the orders of Mr. Trump even though the State Department assured her she had done nothing wrong.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs Ms. Yovanovitch put it, \u201ccontacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\u201d Messrs. Parnas and Fruman have now been arrested and charged with campaign finance violations, including routing illegal contributions to federal candidates from a Russian source.\n\nMuch more remains to be learned about this sordid affair, including the role played by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who also pressed for changes in the board of the Ukrainian energy company, including attempting to install one of his campaign contributors. It\u2019s not known where Messrs. Parnas and Fruman obtained the hundreds of thousands of dollars they poured into GOP campaigns.\n\nBut the bottom line is that there are now two dimensions to Mr. Trump\u2019s abuse of his office in Ukraine: his attempt to induce President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch investigations of former vice president Joe Biden and Ukraine\u2019s purported role in the 2016 election; and his removal of a competent and corruption-fighting ambassador who opposed a questionable venture by men who contributed to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaigns and did business with his personal lawyer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn one instance, Mr. Trump was attempting to advance his personal political interest. In the other, he was trashing the career of a distinguished Foreign Service professional and subverting U.S. foreign policy to serve shady private interests.\n\nThe damage he has done is considerable. As Ms. Yovanovitch summed it up, \u201cThat harm will come not just through the inevitable and continuing resignation and loss of many of this nation\u2019s most loyal and talented public servants. . . . The harm will come when private interests circumvent professional diplomats for their own gain, not the public good. The harm will come when bad actors in countries beyond Ukraine see how easy it is to use fiction and innuendo to manipulate our system.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The damage Trump has done is considerable.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Wyu04nbSkD4qoGyafftrnKQd0WE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H6JRLTXMOYI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
