The answer divided US public opinion, but the media unanimously painted the high school student as a monster.\n\nThe 23-year-old is currently serving 15 months behind bars for the involuntary manslaughter of her ex-boyfriend, but I Love You, Now Die reveals the untold story of Michelle\u2019s mental health struggles, poorly prescribed medication and Conrad\u2019s manipulative texts. At one point, he lied to Michelle and claimed his own mother had seen he was researching methods to kill himself, but turned a blind eye.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nNow viewers have admitted they\u2019re more torn over Michelle\u2019s part in Conrad\u2019s death than they were just days ago.\n\n\u2018Having just watched both episodes of I Love You, Now Die on @SkyCrimeUK, this case certainly wasn\u2019t as cut and dried as I first thought and press made out,\u2019 wrote one stunned audience member. \u2018A story of love and two f**ked up kids. It\u2019s actually very very sad. #ILoveYouNowDie.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother agreed: \u2018\u201cI love you, now die\u201d has got me sooo conflicted.\u2019\n\nMichelle encouraged Conrad Roy to take his own life (Picture: Sky Crime)\n\n\u2018The Michele (sic) Carter case is nuts. I was so sure of what I thought about it, but @HBO documentary spills new info that can\u2019t be ignored. The girl needs serious help, but she\u2019s not a killer. And Conrad was a very manipulative person. #iloveyounowdie,\u2019 and \u2018I think I\u2019ve changed my mind a bit now #ILoveYouNowDie not so clear cut,\u2019 wrote two more viewers taking a U-turn.\n\nTrue crime is still evolving since The Case of Adnan Syed completely flipped perceptions of a guilty verdict. Michelle\u2019s case is one of the foggiest for the \u2018armchair detective\u2019.\n\nConsultant Forensic Psychologist Kerry Daynes spoke to press including Metro.co.uk at the launch of Sky Crime to explain the vitality of exploring these complex narratives, which have otherwise suffered from one-dimensional reporting.\n\n\u2018I think that\u2019s\u2019 what our audience wants,\u2019 said Daynes. \u2018Gone are the days when true crime was the Pot Noodle of television, something you\u2019d watch at 2am in the morning and it was bad guy doing something terrible to the ideal victim.\n\n\u2018I think it perpetuates stereotypes which are harmful in the real world. We live in a world where juries are reluctant to convict ordinary-looking men of rape and don\u2019t believe victims when they come forward. Victims of sexual assault don\u2019t want to come forward in fear of not being believed.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI Love You, Now Die is available to watch on Sky Crime and NOW TV.\n\nNeed support?
