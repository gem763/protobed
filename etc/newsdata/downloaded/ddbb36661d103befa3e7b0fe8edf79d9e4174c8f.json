I asked the Ukraine to investigate the allegations that there was interference in the election of 2016 by the Ukrainians for the benefit of Hillary Clinton, for which there is already a court finding.\u201d\n\nCuomo: \u201cYou never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden and his role with the prosecutor?\u201d\n\nGiuliani: \u201cThe only thing I asked about Joe Biden is to get to the bottom of how it was that Lutsenko, who was appointed, dismissed the case.\u201d\n\nCuomo: \u201cSo you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?\u201d\n\nGiuliani: \u201cOf course I did.\u201d\n\nCuomo: \u201cYou just said you didn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nGiuliani: \u201cI didn\u2019t ask them to look into Joe Biden. I asked them to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nThe argument stems from Joe Biden threatening, as per an Obama administration policy, to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees from Ukraine in 2016 unless its leaders dismissed the country\u2019s top prosecutor, who was embroiled in a corruption scandal. He was later voted out by the Ukrainian parliament.\n\nBut there was a conflict of interest, the New York Times reported. Hunter Biden, the then-vice president\u2019s youngest son, was a board member of Burisma Holdings, an energy company that the ousted prosecutor had been looking into. The new prosecutor then dismissed the Burisma investigation, although he announced this year that he is reopening it \u2014 just as the senior Biden began his 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nLast month, Giuliani said that he had spoken to a Ukrainian official about Joe Biden that focused on his role in removing the former prosecutor. And this week, the Washington Post revealed a whistleblower complaint that Trump allegedly made a \u201cpromise\u201d to a foreign leader, which supposedly \u201ccenters on Ukraine.\u201d People familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal in a story published on Friday that in this July call the president repeatedly pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden\u2019s son.\n\nRelated: Trump repeatedly pressed Ukrainian president to investigate Biden\u2019s son\n\nSo that brings us up to speed on what spurred the heated exchange on CNN.
