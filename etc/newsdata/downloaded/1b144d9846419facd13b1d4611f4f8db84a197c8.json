It should then be removed with a damp cloth or warm water, and your skin will be refreshed and renewed.\n\nThe 15ml size is ideal for anyone who wants to try the clay before investing in the 100ml mask, those who need a travel version, or customers who want a spot treatment for blemishes\n\nThe spot treatment can be used in the same way, or over smaller areas where blemishes or inflammation have occurred.\n\nImmunocologie's founder Karen Ballou points out that the beauty of the green clay is that it is a multitasker and can be used for a variety of skincare complaints and on all skin types.\n\n'It takes the skin into a whole new rejuvenation aspect that you don't feel from most masks,' she tells DailyMail.com. 'It helps with blemishes, helps extract impurities, helps to restore the skin, helps to hydrate the skin, and helps to even out skin tone as it refreshes the skin.'\n\nIMMUNOCOLOGIE'S ESSENTIALS The skincare brand is now offering three of their best-selling products in convenient 10ml travel sizes. The Essentials set, which costs $110 for three products, allows you to sample the Cleansing and Exfoliating Lotions as well as the Super 7 Elixir. The two lotions work together to gently cleanse, detox and exfoliate the skin, while Super 7 Elixir nourishes and provides essential vitamins and minerals to keep your skin glowing.\n\nThe key to the mask's success lies in the 12 essential minerals from green clay water that are infused into the mask. Plant-based ingredients are then also infused into the clay to create the mask.\n\n'Green clay is known to be an anti-inflammatory and healing agent for the skin,' says Karen. 'And aging is all about inflammation.\n\n'Thirteen years ago I started using the clay and beginning to understand its molecular structure, and I discovered it benefits in so many different capacities.'\n\nMother-of-four Karen was diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma eleven years ago, and she says that as a cancer survivor she became increasingly concerned with using ingredients that were natural, organic and healing for the skin.\n\nAfter going into remission six years ago, Karen combined her experience of more than 30 years in the beauty industry with her desire to create the clean, healthy skincare that is found throughout the Immunocologie brand.\n\nShe says: 'One of the things I decided after going through chemotherapy is that I needed to find a way to work with my skin. The clay is not only natural, but it actually delivers results.'\n\nAll the ingredients used in Immunocologie products are natural, organic and sustainably sourced to naturally reduce the signs of aging, such as skin inflammation, redness, wrinkles and fine lines, as it hydrates giving the skin a healthy glow.\n\nKaren adds: 'I wanted to bring to the market a product that would make a difference on everyone's skin - women and men, young and old - that really works, and to provide ingredients that are healthy for the skin and the body.'\n\nGet 20 per cent off all Immunocologie products by using code DAILY20\n\nDailyMail.com may earn commissions on sales from the links on this page.", "description": "The Vital Clay Spot Blemish Treatment features the same formulation as the Vital Clay Mask but in a 15ml size pot.", "authors": ["Annabel Grossman For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/16/20386770-0-image-a-319_1572453584476.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
