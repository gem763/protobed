It would also call for an assessment of how much equipment from Huawei and ZTE is already integrated into networks, and how much it would cost to rip out.\n\nAs part of the proposals, the FCC will also look to establish a \u201creimbursement program\u201d to help telecom carriers implement the changes. A senior FCC official told reporters during a call on Monday that money from the USF is used by hundreds of U.S. telecom providers.\n\nThe FCC will vote on whether to approve the proposals during its next full commission meeting on Nov. 19.\n\nPai cited a Chinese intelligence law that requires any Chinese company or citizen to support and assist in state intelligence work as a key reason for banning the companies, particularly as the rollout of 5G wireless networks kicks off.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to 5G and America\u2019s security, we can\u2019t afford to take a risk and hope for the best,\u201d Pai said. \u201cWe need to make sure our networks won\u2019t harm our national security, threaten our economic security, or undermine our values.\u201d\n\nPai added, \u201cAs the United States upgrades its networks to the next generation of wireless technologies \u2014 5G \u2014 we cannot ignore the risk that the Chinese government will seek to exploit network vulnerabilities in order to engage in espionage, insert malware and viruses, and otherwise compromise our critical communications networks.\u201d\n\nPai also wrote a separate op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on Monday on the proposals, noting that the goal of taking these steps was to \u201cclose security gaps in a fiscally responsible manner.\u201d\n\nNeither Huawei or ZTE immediately responded to request for comment.\n\nAt least one of the other of five FCC commissioners agreed with the proposals.\n\nFCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, who was appointed to the FCC by President Trump Donald John Trump'Veterans for impeachment' signs seen at World Series game during Trump visit Trump met with boos, 'lock him up' chant at Game 5 of World Series Kayla Mueller's mother: Daughter might still be alive 'If Obama had been as decisive' as Trump MORE, tweeted his support for the proposals, writing, \u201cI have no doubt that China intends to spy on persons and businesses within our borders. We must secure our telecom networks from this threat.\u201d\n\nBoth companies have been targeted by U.S. agencies previously due to security concerns, with the Commerce Department adding Huawei to its \u201centity list\u201d in May. U.S. companies are banned from doing business with companies on that list.\n\nTrump also issued an executive order in May that declared a national emergency that empowered his administration to block foreign tech companies from doing business in the U.S. if deemed national security threats.\n\nThe Commerce Department has delayed the full addition of the company to its entity list until Nov. 19, citing more time needed for wireless providers to stop doing business with the company. Trump also called the ban into question when he said at the Group of 20 summit in June that U.S. companies would be allowed to do business with Huawei in cases not deemed a national security threat.\n\nThere has been bipartisan pushback on Capitol Hill against Huawei and ZTE, with members of Congress united in deeming the companies threats. The senior FCC official cited congressional pressure on the FCC to ban the usage of its funds to purchase services or equipment from these companies as being a major factor in rolling out the proposals.\n\nThe proposals are being rolled out over a year after the FCC put out a request for comment on a proposal to prohibit use of FCC USF funds in purchasing equipment or services from companies deemed threats to national security.", "description": "Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai on Monday announced a two-part proposal that would ban the use of FCC funds to buy equipment from companies deemed national security threats, including Chinese telecommunications companies", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/paiajit_061219as4_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
