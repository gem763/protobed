(Reuters) - Democratic U.S. presidential contender Joe Biden plans to tout his economic policy credentials and double down on his attacks on President Donald Trump in a speech on Wednesday in the electoral battleground state of Pennsylvania.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Democratic 2020 U.S. presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at a campaign town hall meeting in Manchester, New Hampshire, U.S., October 9, 2019. REUTERS/Mary Schwalm\n\nBiden, who faces a two-front war against the largest Democratic field in history as well as Trump, will speak in Scranton, the Rust Belt town where he grew up, about \u201cthe middle class values that guide his vision,\u201d his campaign said. The speech is scheduled for 10 a.m. (1400 GMT).\n\nBiden, a leading contender in the Democratic race to take on Trump in the November 2020 election, recommitted to raising the U.S. minimum wage to $15 an hour from the current $7.25, according to a statement released on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has had everything given to him and spent his entire life and presidency enriching himself,\u201d said Biden. \u201cAs president, Trump has not only cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations, but he has made it more difficult for low-income and middle class workers to get what they\u2019ve earned.\u201d\n\nBiden told donors at a fundraiser in Exeter, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday night that \u201cinstead of spending money on these ridiculous tax cuts for the super wealthy,\u201d America could invest in curing cancer or Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cYet again Joe shows not just how out of touch he is with the American middle-class, but with reality,\u201d Trump campaign spokeswoman Erin Perrine said in a statement. \u201cUnder the Trump Administration workers are thriving, unemployment has hit record lows, wages are rising and all while taxes have been cut across the board - benefiting ALL Americans.\u201d\n\nSLEW OF DEMOCRATIC PROPOSALS\n\nBiden has spent much of the past several weeks attacking Trump for his foreign policy and the president\u2019s allegations, offered without evidence, about the foreign business dealings of Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nHis focus is now turning to an economic record that Trump has touted, including unemployment rates that have fallen to multi-decade lows. Biden\u2019s attack comes as U.S. economic growth slows, raising fears of a recession as the benefits of a 2017 tax cut fade and tariffs imposed on Chinese imports hurt American farmers and manufacturers.\n\nDemocrats have unveiled a slew of economic proposals meant to invest in future generations and reverse wealth and income inequality. Their most aggressive policies include universal income guarantees and imposing federal taxes on wealth, not just income.\n\nBiden has sounded a similar tone on inequality - saying regularly in campaign events that \u201cit\u2019s time to reward work, not just wealth\u201d - but has stopped short of supporting many of the more dramatic proposals in the Democratic field.\n\nHe has also criticized his opponents, including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, for not being specific about how they would implement the wealth tax they support or pay for their other proposals, including a Medicare for All plan based on the government-run health insurance program for Americans 65 and older.\n\nBut Biden has yet to release his own full economic plan. He has said he would pay for a $750 billion investment in higher education by raising some inheritance taxes and limiting the tax credits available to higher-income workers.\n\nHe has also said he would pay for an expansion of healthcare benefits by increasing taxes on high-income earners\u2019 investment profits and raising the marginal tax rate on the highest earners back to 39.6% from 37%, to which it was lowered under the Republicans\u2019 2017 tax bill.", "description": "Democratic U.S. presidential contender Joe Biden plans to tout his economic policy credentials and double down on his attacks on President Donald Trump in a speech on Wednesday in the electoral battleground state of Pennsylvania.", "authors": ["Trevor Hunnicutt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1443925637&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M010", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
