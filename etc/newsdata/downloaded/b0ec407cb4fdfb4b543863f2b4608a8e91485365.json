Here\u2019s what you need to know about the controversy, and the reaction.\n\nWhat happened, and why are the Rockets at the heart of it?\n\nAD\n\nMorey got into hot water when he sent a quickly deleted tweet, \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d a message in support for protests that have swelled over the summer.\n\nAD\n\nA proposal by Hong Kong to allow extraditions from the semiautonomous territory to China sparked the protests, which stem from a fear that Beijing\u2019s leaders would seek to systematically pick apart the freedoms promised to Hong Kong when the former British colony returned to Chinese control in 1997.\n\nThe Rockets, who drafted Chinese legend Yao Ming in 2002, are one of the most popular NBA teams in China, and have marketed themselves to a Chinese audience, and Morey\u2019s tweet caused a backlash in China.\n\nAD\n\nSally Jenkins: Don\u2019t be mad at the NBA. Hundreds of U.S. companies have sold out to China\u2019s regime\n\nRockets owner Tilman Fertitta seemed to distance himself from his GM, tweeting that Morey \u201cdoes NOT speak for the\u201d franchise and adding, \u201cwe are NOT a political organization.\u201d He told ESPN: \u201cI have the best general manager in the league. Everything is fine with Daryl and me. We got a huge backlash, and I wanted to make clear that the organization has no political position. We\u2019re here to play basketball and not to offend anybody.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to deleting his tweet, Morey tweeted Sunday: \u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\"\n\nWhy is the timing especially awkward?\n\nAD\n\nTeams from China are playing preseason games in the U.S. this week, including the Guangzhou Long-Lions, who are playing the Wizards in Washington on Wednesday. The Rockets are about to play two games in Japan, and the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets play Thursday in Shanghai and Saturday in China. ESPN will also be broadcasting programming from China this week.\n\nNBA, Rockets face backlash in China over general manager\u2019s tweet\n\nHow has the league reacted?\n\nThe NBA, which has an office in China and plans to add a gaming team in Shanghai to the NBA 2K League, moved swiftly.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable,\u201d the NBA said in a statement. \u201cWhile Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals\u2019 educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOfficials in the U.S. and China say that as many as 500 million Chinese fans watched at least one NBA game last season. \u201cWe have great respect for the history and culture of China,\u201d the NBA said in its statement, \u201cand hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.\u201d\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver acknowledged Monday that Morey\u2019s tweet had damaged the league\u2019s branding efforts, but defended the GM\u2019s right to free speech.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt, the economic impact is already clear,\u201d Silver said in Tokyo. \u201cThere have already been fairly dramatic consequences from that tweet, and I have read some of the media suggesting that we are not supporting Daryl Morey, but in fact we have.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNBA under fire from all directions after response to Rockets-China incident\n\nSilver added that \u201cwhat I am supporting is his freedom of political expression in this situation.\u201d\n\nA statement posted on the league\u2019s Weibo social media network in China, meanwhile, was translated to say that the league is \u201cextremely disappointed in the inappropriate comment\u201d and appeared to use the sort of language often used by state media in China. It added that Morey \u201chas undoubtedly seriously hurt the feelings of Chinese basketball fans.\u201d\n\nThe NBA later clarified that it had put out just one statement, in English.\n\nWhat has been the political response in the United States?\n\nAD\n\nAmerican politicians from both parties criticized the NBA\u2019s response. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), tweeted that the NBA was \u201cshamefully retreating.\u201d Sen. Rick Scott (R-Florida) tweeted that Morey \u201cmade a simple statement of support for freedom for #HongKong and the NBA silenced him.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) tweeted that the NBA \u201cis throwing the GM of the @Houston Rockets under the bus to please the Communist Chinese Govt. Disgusting. They allow #China to punish a U.S. citizen for free speech in order to protect NBA\u2019s market access in China. Grotesque.\u201d\n\n.@NBA is throwing the GM of @HoustonRockets under the bus to please the Communist Chinese Govt.\n\n\n\nDisgusting.\n\n\n\nThey allow #China to punish a U.S. citizen for free speech in order to protect NBA\u2019s market access in China.\n\n\n\nGrotesquehttps://t.co/77lMHTGZyw \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 7, 2019\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro, a Democratic candidate for president, tweeted that the U.S. \u201cmust lead with our values and speak out for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government.\u201d Fellow candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke tweeted \u201cthe only thing the NBA should be apologizing for is their blatant prioritization of profits over human rights.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNBA\u2019s handling of Daryl Morey-China maelstrom shows that money matters most\n\nRep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) tweeted that the \u201c@NBA = no backbone, apparently.\u201d Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) retweeted Castro, who had earlier in the day criticized China\u2019s threats in response to Morey\u2019s initial tweet. \u201cJuli\u00e1n, glad to agree with you on this one,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAD\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) criticized Fertitta for \u201csiding with communism.\"\n\n\u201cListen....some things are more important than money. Like doing the right thing,\u201d he wrote.\n\nListen....some things are more important than money. Like doing the right thing. @dmorey tweeted about human rights and supporting #HongKongProtests. How ironic that you\u2019re siding with communism to advance your greed. https://t.co/RoyJ3o3bbY \u2014 Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) October 7, 2019\n\nHow have NBA players reacted?\n\nJames Harden and Russell Westbrook, two of the NBA\u2019s biggest stars, were asked about the issue during a practice in Tokyo. With Westbrook standing beside him, Harden said, \u201cWe apologize. You know, we love China. We love playing there. For both of us individually, we go there once or twice a year. They show us the most important love.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe appreciate them as a fan base,\u201d Harden continued. \u201cWe love everything there about them, and we appreciate the support that they give us individually and as [an] organization.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe @NBA stands with me for freedom and democracy.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s made all the difference.\n\n\n\nI hope we can build bridges, instead of breaking them. https://t.co/6Y8V16lP7j \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 7, 2019\n\nHave other owners weighed in?\n\nNets owner Joe Tsai, a co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, wrote Sunday night on Facebook that Morey had stepped on \u201ca third-rail issue\u201d in his comment about China and Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cBy now I hope you can begin to understand why the Daryl Morey tweet is so damaging to the relationship with our fans in China,'' Tsai wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t know Daryl personally. I am sure he\u2019s a fine NBA general manager, and I will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been. But the hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.''\n\nAD\n\nSilver attempted to support the owner, as well.\n\n\u201cI am also supporting Joe Tsai,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cI realize, as I said again, these are complex issues they don\u2019t lend themselves easily to social media. I can\u2019t ultimately run the NBA based on trying to satisfy everyone on Twitter.\u201d\n\nWhat has been the reaction in China?\n\nThe Chinese Basketball Association, led by former Rockets star Yao Ming, planned to suspend its relationship with the Rockets because of Morey\u2019s \u201cimproper remarks regarding Hong Kong.\u201d Chinese state television and Tencent, a media partner with ESPN and the NBA in China, said they would not show Rockets games. Tencent has a streaming deal worth $1.5 billion over the next five years.\n\nLi Ning, the shoe company, and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Card Center announced they were suspending partnerships with the Rockets.\n\nAnd the Chinese Basketball Association reportedly canceled planned exhibition games between NBA G League teams scheduled to be held later this month in China because of the controversy.\n\nRead more:\n\nHong Kong leader invokes colonial-era emergency powers to ban masks, sparking more protests\n\nHong Kong protester shot as police disperse anti-China demonstrations on National Day\n\nWhat\u2019s happening in Hong Kong?
