She is called Evelyn. She is eight months old. Eight months is not a long time at all. People hold grudges for longer than that. There are David Lynch films longer than that.\n\nEight months. Let\u2019s say Evelyn lives until 80. She has lived just a tiny fraction of her life. Basically, everything is new to Evelyn. She probably hasn\u2019t even seen a sunset yet. It\u2019s going to blow her mind. I am jealous because she has not read Doctor Zhivago. I\u2019d love to recall discovering tea for the first time; milk as smooth and white as Michelangelo\u2019s David swirling into the cup.\n\nBabies bore me, on the whole, but Evelyn is a revelation. Maybe not when she was small and squishy as a beanbag and her eyelids were always shut against the world. But now: she smiles. She laughs.\n\nWhen this happens, it is a burst of joy in me profound as a flavour. I can make Evelyn grin and giggle and gurgle, which I imagine is an even better feeling than playing to thousands at the Hammersmith Apollo or landing a comedy special on Netflix. Evelyn thinks I am hilarious. I can make the same physical joke all day and she never gets bored. When she laughs she kicks her legs and waggles her arms. You can see the skin around her eyes tries to crease, but it\u2019s so brand new and factory-fresh it can\u2019t be anything but taut.\n\nEvelyn doesn\u2019t just beam when I\u2019m pratting about, however. She smiles when she looks around, taking in new sights; when birds swoop overhead, because what is a bird? When dogs with haircuts trot past. When my sister takes her to the classes that seem mostly to consist of assault via feather boas and squeaky toys.\n\nAfter the week\u2019s urgent scrolling, Saturdays are for the restful rustle of papers | Hannah Jane Parkinson Read more\n\nMy favourite iteration of the baby smile is the one that follows at breakneck speed from the terrifying moment of almost-cry; that liminal state of a tiny person\u2019s mood. There is no better feeling than seeing a contorted, reddening face morph back into a wide smile. This is the baby-entertaining equivalent of saving a conversation going rapidly off the rails with a punchline that lands perfectly.\n\nAnd while Evelyn\u2019s smile is of course the best, the spirits are buoyed by any wide-eyed tot having the time of its life shaking a rattle in the park or tumbling across grass, staggering up, and howling with unselfconscious laughter. I still don\u2019t actually want kids, I don\u2019t think. But I can just borrow Evelyn now, in a good mood, for a quick boost.", "description": "When my niece smiles, it is a burst of joy in me profound as a flavour", "authors": ["Hannah Jane Parkinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d3eb327cfeca37ea32bc7efba394173919218ac/0_178_5610_3368/master/5610.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=31da79300e4287ca76ca8e19019de92e", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
