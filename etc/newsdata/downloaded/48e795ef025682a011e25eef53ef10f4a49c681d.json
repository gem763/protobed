The major breakout in prices came in June, and accelerated as the Fed shifted its stance in monetary policy to more dovish.\n\nGold is often seen as the go-to safe-haven trade in such an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop and when the Fed is cutting rates. Investors haven\u2019t just rotated into physical gold, but also gold-backed ETFs and miners.\n\nFor instance, the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) has gained a cool 16% on the year. Gold mining titan Barrick Gold Corp. (GOLD) has notched an impressive 47% year-to-date ascent.\n\nMost on Wall Street expect the rally to continue... and perhaps blow through the key $1,600 an ounce level.\n\n\u201cInvestors are very worried about the economy and the future of the financial system and they are going to gold as a hedge,\u201d VanEck gold portfolio manager Joe Foster said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade. Foster says both institutional and retail investors have both plowed into gold.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very possible [we blow by $1,600 an ounce]. Gold is establishing a new trend \u2014 I think it\u2019s the beginning of a new bull market in gold,\u201d adds Foster.\n\nDeutsche Bank metals analyst Michael Hsueh thinks gold buying by major central banks during this bout of heightened macro risk is also likely to support higher gold prices.\n\n\u201cWhile speculative and retail investor demand are likely to dominate shorter-term flows, the stability of central bank demand should help to bias gold prices higher over longer timeframes,\u201d Hsueh wrote in a recent note.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-host of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
