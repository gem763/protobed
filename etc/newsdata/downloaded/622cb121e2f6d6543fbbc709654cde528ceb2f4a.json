But heading into today\u2019s U.S. Open final against Bianca Andreescu, Williams, 37 years old, is healthy. She\u2019s not tired or slow, like she was for much of the season. And even when she\u2019s not playing as well as she can, she\u2019s impressive, as she was when she thumped Elina Svitolina, No. 5 in the world, on Thursday evening.\n\n\u201cIt definitely wasn\u2019t my best tennis,\u201d Williams said.\n\nPatrick Mouratoglou, Williams\u2019s long-time coach, said her victory is a lock against Andreescu, who will be playing her first Grand Slam final.\n\n\u201cBianca is going to win Grand Slams,\u201d Mouratoglou said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s sure. But she will have to wait for the first one. She has never faced someone like Serena in her life. Not yet.\u201d\n\nThose are bold words, but Williams, after all, has been dominant for more than 20 years, something women\u2019s tennis had never seen before. And Williams is more confident than she was at Wimbledon, where she had little time to prepare because of an injury.\n\nShe also seems calm and plans to stay that way, unlike at last year\u2019s U.S. Open, where she lost to Naomi Osaka in a controversial match that ended with loud boos aimed at the chair umpire.\n\nStill, this doesn\u2019t mean Andreescu has no chance. She\u2019s confident. She has a lot of options in her game, with solid serves and volleys, and pretty drop shots. Yes, Andreescu is just 19 years old, but she has jumped up the rankings all year. She said she has just one match to go and badly wants it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s going to bring her A game,\u201d Andreescu said. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to bring my A game, too. Hopefully I guess the best player may win.\u201d\n\nEarly Friday morning, Williams worked essentially in silence. On the grounds, just eight people watched as Williams loosened up first, and then began to crush the ball. She looked faster than she has since she hurt her ankle at the Australian Open (she also recently had pain in her left knee).\n\nMackie Shilstone, a long-time trainer, has worked with Williams for more than 10 years. He said when he arrived here before the Open, Williams looked solid from the start.\n\n\u201cWith any tennis player, if the knee fails you or the ankle or whatever, you\u2019re going to start serving with your shoulder,\u201d Shilstone said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the beginning of downfall.\u201d\n\nWilliams missed four straight major tournaments because of her pregnancy, and has struggled since returning to the sport after the birth of her child, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., in September of 2017. Mouratoglou said Williams is remarkable in how she has recovered since Alexis\u2019s birth.\n\n\u201cThis takes a lot of time, both physically and mentally,\u201d Mouratoglou said. \u201cI think her body is the body of a top athlete again. And she hasn\u2019t been injured since two weeks before Wimbledon, so now we had many weeks in a row.\u201d (Mouratoglou said that the back spasms that caused her to retire in the Toronto final against Andreescu are no longer an issue.)\n\nAndreescu has had injuries this year, too. She almost declined to play in Toronto this summer because she was rehabbing her shoulder. But once she was cleared, she began an improbable comeback. Andreescu has now won 12 matches in a row since she arrived in Toronto. And it doesn\u2019t seem to bother Andreescu that she had won just two matches in three major events before this tournament.\n\nBelinda Bencic, whom Andreescu beat in the semifinals, said Andreescu plays like a veteran, rather than a rookie. \u201cShe\u2019s a very smart player on the court, plays different than other players,\u201d Bencic said. \u201cThat\u2019s why she\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nWilliams insists that she is a different player right now than the one who lost the Wimbledon final, more like her former self. More important: Despite what most people expect, Williams insists that she is not feeling extra pressure from trying to take her 24th slam and tie Margaret Court\u2019s record.\n\n\u201cI literally haven\u2019t thought about it this tournament,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI\u2019ve been way more chill.\u201d\n\nBianca Andreescu reacts during a match against Belinda Bencic.

If she falls behind early, she often adjusts her game without panicking.\n\n\u201dShe\u2019s a warrior and she\u2019s a street fighter,\u201d said Sylvain Bruneau, her coach. \u201cShe strives to compete. I strongly hope and I\u2019m pretty confident she\u2019s going to step [up] in the arena.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Open final is one thing, but any final against Williams is quite another. But Andreescu said she couldn\u2019t wait to get started.\n\n\u201c[Williams] is an amazing champion on and off the court,\u201d Andreescu said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fun.\u201d", "description": "Serena Williams is one win away from her 24th Grand Slam title, while 19-year-old Bianca Andreescu aims to play spoiler in Saturday\u2019s U.S. Open women\u2019s final.", "authors": ["Tom Perrotta"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105038/social", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
