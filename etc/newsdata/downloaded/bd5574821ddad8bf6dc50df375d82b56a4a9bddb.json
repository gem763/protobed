Today\u2019s guest columnist is former U.S. Sen. Harry Reid.\n\nGrowing up in the Mojave Desert in the mining town of Searchlight, I never understood the sensitivity of the environment \u2014 even as mining ravaged the beautiful desert landscape.\n\nThere were holes everywhere. There were tunnels. There were shafts, some vertical and some at various angles. But each was a disturbance of the desert surface. And, to top it off, 99 percent of the diggings produced no gold or other precious metals. It was mostly for nothing.\n\nIt was only as an adult that I began to realize the fragility of my place of birth.\n\nToday, the Nevada deserts \u2014 along with environments throughout the country and the world \u2014 are facing threats much greater than bulldozers, shovels and unscrupulous mining operations. That threat is climate change.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying the disastrous effects climate change is having on every corner of Nevada, our country and our planet. Even the beautiful Joshua Tree forest 5 miles from my Searchlight home is in distress. In the last few years alone, we\u2019ve seen record wildfires in the West, multiple 100-year floods and a drought that left Lake Mead 4 feet away from a federal water shortage.\n\nI won\u2019t be around to see the worst impacts of climate change, but my children, grandchildren and countless families around the world will be. They\u2019ll suffer the brunt of this crisis. They\u2019ll bear the burden of cleaning up my generation\u2019s mess.\n\nWe can, and must, do better.\n\nWe have a moral obligation to work together to protect our natural legacy. The time has come for the executive branch and Congress to support common-sense legislation to reduce carbon emissions, protect our environment and grow a clean energy economy.\n\nThere is no time to lose. If we continue pumping pollution into our air, my grandchildren will live on a planet 3 degrees hotter when they reach their 40s. Three degrees may not sound like much, but it\u2019s the difference between a livable planet and a West dried up from drought and communities wiped off the map by wildfires. It\u2019s a future where Midwest farms wallow under crop-killing floods and residents of coastal cities are forced to flee from rising seas. It\u2019s a future we must do everything in our power to prevent.\n\nNevada has set an example for our country, showing that protecting our natural environment can also boost our economy. So far, Nevada has invested $7.7 billion in renewable energy and generated more than 32,000 clean energy jobs.\n\nDespite our disagreements, Nevada politicians \u2013 Democrats and Republicans \u2013 have recognized and embraced the opportunity of renewable energy to clean our environment, create jobs and power our state with resilient, locally produced and sustainable energy. From protecting treasured public lands and setting aside space for wind and solar development, to investing in renewable energy and transforming the state\u2019s sustainability efforts, Nevada\u2019s leaders have delivered for the state by working together.\n\nIn 2013, I collaborated with Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval, the gaming industry and environmental groups to double down on renewables in Nevada and phase out coal. The legislation wasn\u2019t perfect, but it got the job done.\n\nI\u2019m happy to see that work continuing.\n\nEarlier this year, Gov. Steve Sisolak signed a bill passed unanimously by the Legislature that requires 50 percent of our state\u2019s energy to come from renewables over the next decade. This makes Nevada\u2019s renewable energy standards among the strongest in the country.\n\nAnd in July, I was gratified to see Nevada\u2019s Democratic senators, Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, partner with Nevada\u2019s Republican Rep. Mark Amodei on legislation that continues a critical tax credit for solar and other clean energy technologies. Letting this credit expire would be an enormous mistake, costing renewable energy jobs and slowing our progress on addressing climate change.\n\nThis collaboration on clean energy solutions is not only good for Nevada, but the whole planet. But this alone is not enough. We must keep building on these efforts if we are to slow and stop the onslaught of climate change.\n\nWe are feeling the consequences of our changing climate today. We cannot leave our children our having done nothing. It will soon be too late to act.\n\nHarry Reid served in the U.S. Senate from 1987 to 2017, and was the Senate majority leader from 2007 to 2015.", "description": "There\u2019s no denying the disastrous effects climate change is having on every corner of Nevada, our country and our planet.
