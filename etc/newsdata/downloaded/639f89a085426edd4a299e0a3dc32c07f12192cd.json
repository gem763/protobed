United will need to be prepared for a very difficult game and the sad part is that Liverpool are overwhelming favourites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I try to stay optimistic but it is going to be very difficult for United to get a result if they play the way they did against Newcastle. That was probably the s******* game I have seen them play, honestly, it was painful.\n\n\u2018It is still early in the season and maybe there is still time to turn things around, to catch up to the top four, there is still time in my opinion but they need to correct the way they are playing football, the way they move into the spaces, how the players are looking for the ball, their speed of the ball when they are passing \u2013 these are the things they need to work on.\n\n\u2018United now have an opportunity to challenge themselves but it is going to be difficult because they have had players on international duty that are only just coming back and they will only have a couple of days to prepare, train and play together.\n\n\u2018If you look at the tempo and the way United are playing, as a United player you feel s*** and you look at the games that you play and you don\u2019t feel well, but now they need to challenge themselves and this big test is a great way for them to do just that.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs well as being in poor form, United\u2019s chances of beating Liverpool at Old Trafford have been made harder by the absence of a number of key players including David De Gea and Paul Pogba who are both out injured.\n\nLiverpool, on the other hand, are expected to be at full-strength with Alisson Becker and Joel Matip both returning to full training this week and Mohamed Salah likely to overcome an ankle problem sustained against Leicester City.", "description": "Dimitar Berbatov has conceded that Liverpool are the 'overwhelming favourites' to beat his former club Manchester United on Sunday after describing their 1-0 defeat to Newcastle as 's***'.
