He has also lost his working majority in Parliament and been told by Scotland\u2019s highest court that his decision to suspend Parliament was illegal.\n\nJohnson portrays himself as more convinced than ever that Britain will break with the EU at the end of October.\n\nHe will have a lunchtime meeting in Luxembourg on Monday with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to try to modify the Irish backstop that has been a main sticking point, but EU leaders did not seem impressed by Johnson\u2019s invocation of the Hulk.\n\nThe European Parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, said the comments showed a lack of maturity.\n\n\u201cEven to Trumpian standards the Hulk comparison is infantile,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIs the EU supposed to be scared by this? The British public impressed?\u201d\n\nJuncker, who has downplayed hopes of a breakthrough at Monday\u2019s meeting, also expressed alarm that many people in Britain seem to feel a British departure without a deal with the EU would be a positive thing.\n\n\u201cIt would be terrible chaos,\u201d he said in an interview with Germany\u2019s Deutschlandfunk radio. \u201cAnd we would need years to put things back in order. Anyone who loves his country, and I assume that there are still patriots in Britain, would not want to wish his country such a fate.\u201d\n\nThe Oct. 31 deadline looms large because Johnson has not said he will seek another extension if no deal is reached, despite legislation passed by Parliament shortly before it was suspended.\n\nBritain\u2019s Supreme Court this week will rule on whether Johnson overstepped the law when he shut the legislature for a crucial five-week period.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats, who have been enjoying a revival, voted overwhelmingly at their party conference Sunday to end the Brexit process entirely if they come to power.\n\nParty leader Jo Swinson said Article 50, which triggered Brexit, would be revoked if she becomes prime minister.\n\nThe party gained an important member Saturday with the defection of Sam Gyimah, a former Conservative minister. He is the sixth legislator to switch allegiance and join the Liberal Democrats this year.\n\nJohnson also continues to take flak from former Prime Minister David Cameron, who called the 2016 referendum on Brexit.\n\nCameron said in an interview published Sunday that Johnson didn\u2019t really believe in Brexit when he broke ranks and led the campaign to take Britain out of the EU. Cameron had been expecting Johnson\u2019s help during the hard-fought campaign.\n\nCameron says of Johnson: \u201cThe conclusion I am left with is that he risked an outcome he didn\u2019t believe in because it would help his political career.\u201d\n\nCameron is giving interviews to gain publicity for his upcoming memoirs.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has compared himself to the Hulk in a newspaper interview emphasizing his determination to take Britain out of the...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP830_boris__ZG_20190821054807.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
