Congress will likely have a chance to correct this shameful fact this week with a vote on Armenian Genocide recogniztion. In 2007, the International Association of Genocide Scholars unanimously affirmed that: \u201cthe Ottoman campaign against Christian minorities of the Empire between 1914 and 1923 constituted a genocide against Armenians, Assyrians, and Pontian and Anatolian Greeks.\u201d\n\nThe facts are clear; the moral principles compelling. With the world looking to America as leaders of the genocide prevention movement, why has our government been unwilling to speak the simple truth?\n\nThe answer lies in Ankara. Successive U.S. administrations and sessions of Congress effectively granted Turkish leaders a veto on this issue, in the hope that Turkey might someday realize its potential as a modern secular democratic Muslim-majority nation \u2013 anchored to the West, incorporated into Europe, and a partner in NATO. Over the course of many decades, presidents deployed euphemisms and evasive terminology to avoid saying \u201cArmenian Genocide\u201d and Congressional leaders derailed resolutions commemorating this crime all in the expectation of some return down the road. This was a massive misguided investment of American moral capital in the U.S.-Turkey relationship.\n\nSadly, Ankara never reciprocated, and Erdogan turned away from the West. Since the failed coup of 2016, he has followed a markedly anti-American regional trajectory \u2013 undermining U.S. interests, antagonizing our allies, and attacking our core American values. Erdogan\u2019s unjust imprisonment of American Pastor Andrew Brunson stands out as a high-profile example of the offensive actions he has undertaken. Trump\u2019s powerful response to Turkey\u2019s hostage-taking \u2013 including his administration\u2019s threats of crippling sanctions \u2013 freed Pastor Brunson. The president, ignoring the timid advice of the Washington, D.C. \u201cestablishment\u201d to always treat Ankara with kid gloves, played hardball and got results, proving to the world that pressure works. But, sadly, Turkey returned to its bad habits, continuing with its record-breaking jailing of journalists, suppression of political dissent, and repression of religious liberty. Erdogan\u2019s purchase of Russian S-400 missiles, over NATO objections, led to Turkey\u2019s expulsion from the U.S.-lead F-35 program, widening the U.S.-Turkey rift.\n\nIn just the past few weeks, we\u2019ve seen Erdogan double down on his anti-American trajectory, launching cross-border attacks on America\u2019s Kurdish and Christian allies and committing atrocities against at-risk Christian civilians in northeast Syria, despite assurances he had given the Trump Administration.\n\nPresident Trump and Vice President Pence continue to seek constructive engagement with Ankara, even as Erdogan antagonizes America and our allies. As Erdogan drives the transformation of our bilateral relationship from an actual alliance to a more transactional type of arms-length partnership, we can and should put back on the table the long list of domestic and regional issues that we once set aside out of deference to a friendly nation. At the top of this list is Turkey\u2019s largely unrecognized, entirely unpunished destruction of the Christian nations that had lived for thousands of years in their biblical-era homelands. It may have been politically expedient \u2013 if not morally justifiable \u2013 to remain silent about these crimes as long as Turkey was a reliable ally, but today, with Turkey clearly unreliable and obviously not an ally, we must make up for lost time, actively confronting Ankara\u2019s lies and assertively seeking to end its obstruction of justice.\n\nThe United States should reject Ankara\u2019s gag-rule and speak in the voice of the American people. We can do that by passing H.Res.296 and H.Res.150, bipartisan measures \u2013 strongly supported by our partners at the Armenian National Committee of America - that specifically cite the \u201ccampaign of genocide against Armenians, Greeks, Assyrians, Chaldeans, Syriacs, Arameans, Maronites, and other Christians.\u201d Adoption of these measures, along with appropriate commemoration from the White House, will send a powerful signal to Erdogan that the United States is done covering up for Ankara\u2019s crimes and will hold Turkey accountable for the crimes across Syria and inside its own borders.\n\nToufic Baaklini is a Lebanese-American with more than 30 years of business experience in finance and development.
