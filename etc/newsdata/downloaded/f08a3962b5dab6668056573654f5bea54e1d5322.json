That would be consistent with an attack coming from the direction of the northern Persian Gulf, Iran or Iraq, rather than from Yemen, where the Iranian-backed Houthi militia that claimed responsibility for the strikes operates.\n\nAdministration officials, in a background briefing for reporters as well as in separate interviews on Sunday, also said a combination of drones and cruise missiles \u2014 \u201cboth and a lot of them,\u201d as one senior United States official put it \u2014 might have been used. That would indicate a degree of scope, precision and sophistication beyond the ability of the Houthi rebels alone.\n\nSign up for the Morning Briefing newsletter\n\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 3 NEXT SLIDE > A satellite image of smoke rising from a plant in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia, on Saturday. \u00a9 Planet Labs Inc, via Associated Press\n\nMr. Trump, however, did not name Iran, saying he needed to consult with Saudi Arabia first.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked,\u201d he said in a tweet on Sunday evening. \u201cThere is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Saturday that Iran was behind what he called \u201can unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply\u201d and asserted that there was \u201cno evidence the attacks came from Yemen.\u201d He did not, however, say where they came from, and the Saudis refrained from directly blaming Iran.\n\nThe administration\u2019s determination that Iran played a direct role in the attack marked a significant escalation in months of back-and-forth tensions between the United States and Iran. It raised questions about how Washington might retaliate \u2014 and why Iran would have risked such a confrontation.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s warning echoed one he made in June after Iran shot down an American surveillance drone. He said then that the military had been \u201ccocked and loaded\u201d for a strike against Iran.\n\nHe said he called off the strike with 10 minutes to spare when a general told him that 150 people would probably die in the attack, which he said would have been disproportionate.\n\nAdministration officials said on Sunday they would seek to declassify more intelligence to buttress their case against Iran in the coming days. The satellite photographs released on Sunday did not appear as clear cut as officials suggested, with some appearing to show damage on the western side of the facilities, not from the direction of Iran or Iraq.\n\nAmerican officials said that more than 17 weapons were directed at the Saudi facilities, but not all reached their targets. Forensic analyses of the recovered weapons could answer questions about what they were, who manufactured them and who launched them.\n\nIran forcefully rejected Mr. Pompeo\u2019s accusation on Sunday, with the foreign minister dismissing it as \u201cmax deceit.\u201d The office of the Iraqi prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, also rejected any suggestion that Iranian operatives carried out the attack from Iraqi territory, saying Iraq would act firmly if its territory were used to attack other countries.\n\nIf Iran, or one of its proxies in Iraq or Yemen, carried out the attacks, it would fit into a strategy Iran has followed for months in its escalating confrontation with the Trump administration.\n\nSqueezed by sweeping American sanctions on its oil sales, Iran has sought to inflict a similar pain on its adversaries \u2014 threatening the ability of Saudi Arabia and other American allies in the Persian Gulf to sell oil and holding out the possibility of driving up international oil prices in the months before President Trump seeks re-election.\n\n\u201cIran wants to show that instead of a win-lose contest, Iran can turn this into a lose-lose dynamic for everyone,\u201d said Ali Vaez, head of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group.\n\nYet Iran has stopped short of carrying out the kind of direct, open attack on United States allies that might trigger a military response, preferring to let regional allies do the work or at least share the blame.\n\n\u201cPlausible deniability is a trademark of Iran\u2019s pushback strategy,\u201d Mr. Vaez said.\n\nThe combination of military pressure and deniability also fits with a strategy of increasing Iran\u2019s bargaining power before possible talks at the United Nations this month.\n\nPresident Emanuel Macron of France has said he hopes the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, which opens Tuesday, will be an opportunity for de-escalation between the United States and Iran. The recent hostilities began when the Trump administration withdrew last year from an agreement to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program and then this year imposed sweeping sanctions to try to force Iran into a more restrictive covenant.\n\nSeveral other world powers, including France, also signed the original agreement and still support it, and Mr. Macron has said he hopes to hold talks at the General Assembly about saving the agreement. Mr. Trump said this month that he was open to a possible meeting there with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran.\n\nEven as Iranian diplomats denied any role in the attack, others close to Iran\u2019s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were reveling in the damage at the Saudi oil facilities, which process the vast majority of the country\u2019s crude output.\n\nThe Trump administration, said Naser Imani, a former member of the guard\u2019s political bureau, should take it as a warning to the United States and its Persian Gulf partners.\n\n\u201cIf a few Houthis can cause this extensive damage, imagine what Iran could do if it was forced into a military conflict,\u201d he said in a telephone interview on Sunday. \u201cIran has proved in the past few months that it has the will to pull the trigger as well as the military power to do so.\u201d\n\nA military strategist with the Revolutionary Guards, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, also questioned whether the Houthis alone could have carried out such a complex and effective attack without Iranian help.\n\nBut whoever carried out the attack, the Iranian strategist said, the message to the West and its regional allies was the same. If the United States strikes Iran, \u201cthe flames of war in the Persian Gulf will burn you all,\u201d he said.\n\nA senior commander for the Revolutionary Guards insisted that the country was ready for \u201cfull-fledged\u201d war, the semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported, according to Reuters.\n\n\u201cEverybody should know that all American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometers around Iran are within the range of our missiles,\u201d said Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 air force.\n\nHow the Trump administration responds remains to be seen. Breaking with a pattern under both Democratic and Republican presidents, the Trump administration has said that it intends to hold Iran fully responsible for any attacks carried out by the Houthis or other regional allies that the administration deems Iranian proxies.\n\nPrevious administrations have said that Iran was arming and training allied groups such as the Lebanese militia Hezbollah and Shiite militias in Syria or Iraq to extend its regional influence. Yet in the past, the United States has generally declined to retaliate against Iran militarily even when those groups have attacked the American military, as Iranian-backed Shiite militias did during American occupation of Iraq.\n\nReporting was contributed by Stanley Reed, Falih Hassan, Michael Wolgelenter and Michael D.
