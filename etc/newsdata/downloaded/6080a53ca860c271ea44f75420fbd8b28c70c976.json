According to one survey, conducted by the trusty academic journal Cosmopolitan, 67% of women have pretended to climax.\n\nThere are lots of obvious reasons why women faux-gasm \u2013 they don\u2019t want to hurt their partners feelings, for example, or they\u2019re just tired and want to go to sleep. However, according to a study just published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior another big factor is feeling squeamish about using the C-word. Researchers found that women who \u201cstrongly agreed that they find it easy to use words like \u2018clitoris\u2019 to talk about sex were less likely to fake orgasms than those who strongly disagree\u201d. The study concluded that gender norms and \u201csexual double standards continue to limit female sexual expression, inhibiting some women\u2019s sexual communication and in particular their comfort level in receiving or asking for sexual pleasure\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly new news that there is a sexual double standard. However this study is a jarring reminder of just how much shame is still attached to female desire, and how many women have internalized that shame. \u201cClitoris\u201d shouldn\u2019t be a dirty word and yet people still tiptoe around it as if the mere mention of something that exists purely for female pleasure is obscene.\n\nSociety\u2019s fear of the clitoris has ramifications far beyond the bedroom. Earlier this year, for example, the UK had its first conviction for female genital mutilation. Writing in the Guardian, Lucy McCormick noted that \u201cone of the things that stands out from the news reports of that case is how oddly furtive they were about communicating the key facts,\u201d in particular their avoidance of the word clitoris. As McCormick noted: \u201cYoung girls around the world are suffering horrendous mutilation because of a deep-rooted cultural fear of female pleasure, and the same fear is preventing us from even articulating the problem.\u201d\n\nSo let\u2019s stop being so afraid of the clitoris shall we? That was obviously a rhetorical question; the answer is yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\nTrump administration argues abortion isn\u2019t a human right\n\nThe war on abortion and access to birth control that is currently being waged in America is also, of course, about the regulation of female pleasure; under patriarchy women exist purely to service men and to reproduce. On Monday Alex Azar, the US health and human services secretary, told the UN General Assembly that abortion isn\u2019t a human right. \u201cWe do not support references to ambiguous terms and expressions such as \u2018sexual and reproductive health and rights\u2019 in UN documents, because they can undermine the critical role of the family and promote practices like abortion,\u201d he said. Azar, by the way, is a deeply religious Orthodox Christian who has been complicit in the Trump\u2019s administrations attacks on Medicaid and Obamacare. He is, in short, a morally-bankrupt religious zealot who hates women and wants to stamp out affordable health care. No wonder Trump picked him as his health secretary.\n\nMexico\u2019s Oaxaca state decriminalizes abortion\n\nIn slightly better reproductive rights news, Oaxaca has become the second jurisdiction in Mexico to decriminalize abortion, following Mexico City.\n\nNew South Wales decriminalizes abortion\n\nAustralia\u2019s most populous state also joined the 21st century this week, finally overturning a 119-year-old law banning abortion.\n\nWoman who started French #MeToo fined for defamation\n\nJournalist Sandra Muller has been ordered to pay thousands of euros in damages to Eric Brion, a TV executive she accused of sexual harassment. Brion admits that he made inappropriate remarks to Muller but says her accusations wrongly portrayed him as a sex offender and ruined his career. Muller has called the ruling \u201ca message to shut up\u201d and will be appealing.\n\nWomen could boost Malaysia\u2019s economy\n\n\u201cIf all economic barriers are removed for women in Malaysia, the country\u2019s income per capita could grow by 26.2%,\u201d according to the World Bank.\n\nSaudi Arabia loosens dress code for tourists\n\nForeign women will no longer have to wear an abaya (a loose robe), but will still have to dress modestly. The relaxed dress code is part of a wider tourism push and attempts by the kingdom to modernize its image. While these changes are encouraging, Saudi Arabia still very much practices a system of gender apartheid. Some of its most prominent female activists are also still in jail, and have reportedly been tortured.\n\nMen are reporting women on Tinder for turning them down\n\nLauren Vinopal didn\u2019t want to go on a second date with a guy she met on Tinder. She turned him down nicely, saying she didn\u2019t want to lead him on. In response he sent her harassing messages and then got her banned from platform. Writing in Mel Magazine, Vinopal notes she\u2019s not the only \u201cwoman to have been kicked off the app for no other reason than I rejected the wrong guy.\u201d Apparently getting women booted off dating apps is an increasingly popular strategy for guys who can\u2019t deal with rejection.\n\nWeekend long read: Stories About My Brother\n\nPrachi Gupta\u2019s devastating essay about her brother Yush\u2019s death is a harrowing account of how harmful toxic masculinity can be for men. \u201cI believe even more intensely than ever that rigid gender roles harm men, too, and the effects can be deadly,\u201d Gupta writes.\n\nThere\u2019s now a helpline for adults who are angry with Greta Thunberg\n\nAn inordinate number of middle-aged men seem to be going out of their minds because a teenage girl doesn\u2019t want the world to collapse. In response to the rise of Greta Derangement Syndrome a satirist has created The Greta Thunberg Helpline, \u201cfor adults angry at a child.\u201d Let\u2019s hope that Trump gives it a call sometime.", "description": "People still tiptoe around the word as if the mere mention of something that exists purely for female pleasure is obscene", "authors": ["Arwa Mahdawi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3373e214ee4fbf695b2a4654e9534d447caa954b/0_141_2702_1622/master/2702.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=96b1efa7f1668f8459abf8a4aaa3b23c", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
