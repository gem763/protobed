Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters Monday that planning has just begun.\n\n\u201cThere has been a discussion about possibly doing it,\u201d he said during a press conference while traveling in Afghanistan. \u201cThere has been no decision with regard to numbers or anything like that.\u201d\n\nThe administration last week negotiated a cease-fire between Turkey and the Kurdish-led SDF, which had been a key American ally in the fight against the Islamic State but a group that Ankara views as a terrorist threat. As the SDF last week redirected its forces to fight the Turkish military, there were widespread fears that ISIS could see a resurgence and could potentially recapture key territory in Syria, including valuable oil reserves in the eastern part of the country.\n\nA key deadline looms Tuesday as a U.S.-brokered 120-hour cease-fire expires, with Turkey warning the fighting will resume if Kurdish fighters have not left a designated buffer zone Ankara has demanded just inside the Syrian border.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t withdraw, our operation will re-start,\u201d Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in Istanbul Monday.\n\nA senior Kurdish official told the Associated Press that his forces are complying with the cease-fire and are completing the withdrawal of forces from along a section of the shared border with Turkey. Redur Khalil told the AP Monday that Turkish forces are violating the cease-fire, accusing its troops of shelling a village and carrying out military operations.\n\nHe said the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces are preparing to complete the withdrawal from the area between Ras al-Ayn and Tal Abyad towns, which flank the 75 miles covered under the cease-fire.\n\nMr. Trump on Monday stood by his decision to order a withdrawal, comparing the fight between the Kurds and the Turks to two kids in the lot fighting out old grievances. He told a Cabinet meeting Monday that Turkey has taken casualties, too.\n\n\u201cPlenty of Turks have been killed because of conflict on their borders. You have to look at both ways,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile many on Capitol Hill say the surprise U.S. withdrawal amounted to a betrayal of a faithful ally, Mr. Trump said the U.S. \u201cnever made a commitment to the Kurds,\u201d and that he\u2019ll \u201cwork something out so they have some money,\u201d hinting at a deal with oil companies or some other kind of \u201ccash flow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe never agreed to protect the Kurds for the rest of their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to take a position. Let them fight themselves.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also explicitly said there\u2019s \u201cno reason\u201d for American troops to remain Syria other than to \u201csecure oil.\u201d\n\nRising criticism\n\nBut critics showed no signs of easing up, blasting the oil field protection plan as another example of what they say is the president\u2019s rash, incoherent foreign policy. Using U.S. forces to protect Syrian oil fields for the sake of making some sort of financial deal with the Kurds, they say, could be disastrous.\n\n\u201cA president shouldn\u2019t talk like that, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Brett McGurk, the administration\u2019s former special presidential envoy in the fight against Islamic State, said Monday.\n\n\u201cThis is the problem of not having a national security process,\u201d he said during a panel discussion hosted by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington. \u201cIf you have a process before presidents say things, you would have some deliberation. We don\u2019t want that oil to get in the hands of terrorists and other actors, but to say an American company is going to go in and exploit it, that raises serious illegal implications.\u201d\n\nMr. McGurk announced his resignation last December shortly after the president first announced that the U.S. would withdraw its forces from Syria. Former Defense Secretary James Mattis also resigned over the decision.\n\nForeign policy analysts say there are other, broader problems with the plan to keep U.S. troops in Syria for the purposes of guarding oil fields. For starters, they argue that the SDF \u2014 which accused the president of undermining their cause when he pulled special operations forces away from the Syria-Turkey border ahead of the Turkish assault \u2014 simply no longer trust the administration.\n\n\u201cTrust in the Trump administration is now virtually non-existent,\u201d said Charles Lister, director of the countering terrorism and extremism program at the Middle East Institute. \u201cThat some in Washington think another about-turn in policy allowing us to stay in negligible numbers, in a smaller piece of territory, would somehow enable us to sustain an anti-ISIS campaign and control Syria\u2019s oil fields is nothing short of a fantasy. Perhaps after President Trump described Syria as \u2018sand and death,\u2019 some thought to appeal to his business bias by dangling the prospect of valuable oil resources to grab his attention.\u201d\n\nObservers also describe a growing humanitarian crisis in the contested Syrian zone. The aid group Save the Children said some 70,000 children have been displaced since the start of the Turkish offensive, and the UN estimates that more than 176,000 people have been uprooted.\n\nIt\u2019s also become increasingly clear that the U.S. military\u2019s popularity among the Kurdish-dominated in northeastern Syria is plummeting rapidly, raising questions about whether they could become targets if they remain in the country.\n\nAs the American convoy leaving the city of Qamishli was buffeted on Monday, protesters shouted \u201cNo America\u201d and \u201cAmerica liar,\u201d the Associated Press reported.\n\n\u201cLike rats, America is running away,\u201d one protester yelled.\n\n\u2022 Tom Howell Jr. contributed to this article, which is based in part on wire service\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
