Because the reality star and Good American designer is going through it on social media thanks to a photo she posted that has fans claiming she's fully unrecognizable. And honestly, everyone is being pretty harsh\u2014to the point where Khlo\u00e9 had to turn off comments on her recent posts.\n\nThe Instagram pic in question features KoKo smiling at the camera, and for what it's worth she claims it's an \"old photo\" in the caption.\n\nWhile comments are currently off (presumably thanks to trolls doing the most), people have, naturally, taken it to Twitter to go deep in their Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian feelings.\n\nyou want me to believe THIS is khloe kardashian? foh pic.twitter.com/BMdofSVmIc \u2014 get loudinator (@gukkieboi) October 1, 2019\n\nIs it just me or @khloekardashian did something to her face????? This is not a hate tweet, I love Koko she\u2019s the realest but there\u2019s really something diff about this selfie of hers \ud83e\udd14 pic.twitter.com/F5kHbFAJF2 \u2014 Girl Gang (@gorlpower_) September 30, 2019\n\nOf course, we all know that Khlo\u00e9 looks like herself IRL thanks to this thing called Keeping Up with the Kardashians, so photoshop is being blamed for this picture looking a lil' different:\n\nCan we talk about Khloe Kardashian for a sec. like just wow.\n\n\n\nWhy photoshop yourself that you\u2019re not even recognizable. pic.twitter.com/O1XP4xTphQ\n\n\n\n\u2014 AmburleenRead (@WasabiTwinkie) October 1, 2019\n\nKhloe Kardashian literally looks CGI in this pic.twitter.com/90s6lvpzdX \u2014 Hann\ud83e\udd94 (@yasssshannah) September 30, 2019\n\nEither way, can Khlo\u00e9 live?! If she wants to post a photoshopped pic to Instagram that seems like her business, and who among us hasn't dabbled in the fine art of Facetune? That said, there is a conversation to be had about Instagram vs. Real life (in a nice, non-judgmental way), so with that in mind.... Are you alarmed by the abundance of photoshopped pics you're seeing on the Kardashians' Instagrams lately, or does it just go with the territory at this point? Smash! That!
