And she added some happy news: He's cancer-free.\n\n\"I made a list, I wrapped it around my rose quartz and prayed for my scorpio,\" Manzo wrote in an Instagram post alongside a selfie of the smiling couple.\n\n\"You\u2019re everything I prayed for and more. I love you @davecantin,\" read the rest of Manzo's emoji-filled message. \"Happy Birthday. Here\u2019s to a lifetime of HAPPY HEALTHY Birthday celebrations together. #40andLeukemiaFREE.\"\n\nIn 2016, Cantin told the USA TODAY Network his doctor said, \u201cYou have cancer, but you hit the lotto.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018How can cancer be hitting the lotto?\u2019\u201d the former car dealer said.\n\nThe doc explained Cantin had chronic myeloid leukemia, a cancer of the white blood cells that is treatable by chemotherapy pills.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be back to work in a month,\u201d the doctor told him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to run the Boston Marathon, but you\u2019re going to live.\u201d\n\nCantin returned to work in seven days. A few weeks after that, he did complete the Boston Marathon. And he continued to take chemotherapy pills twice a day.\n\nManzo and Cantin have been together since 2015.\n\nIn May, Manzo revealed she and Cantin had been married nearly two years.\n\n\"The bride wore a dress from her closet, an orange blossom in her hair and carried a Calla Lily from her Malibu Garden,\" she wrote in an Instagram post with a photo of the two of them on their wedding day. \"In front of the gorgeous Pacific, surrounded by nature and puppies, they promised to be there in good times and bad. A simple, meaningful wedding on a day chosen by the stars. ... and so it is.\"\n\nManzo ended the post with #thirdtimesacharm 6\u202228\u202217, presumably their wedding date.\n\nSee our full coverage of entertainment news\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/27/rhonj-star-dina-manzo-says-husband-dave-cantin-leukemia-free/2481067001/", "description": "\"Real Housewives of New Jersey\" alum Dina Manzo's sweet birthday tribute to husband Dave Cantin on Saturday added some happy news: He's cancer-free.", "authors": ["Susan Haas", "Published P.M.
