Their effort to bring sanity to their Party is commendable,\u201d Donohue says.\n\n\u201cBut it is quite clear that they have failed,\u201d he concludes.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "The latest Democrat debate shows just how hostile the party has become toward people of faith, said Catholic League President Bill Donohue.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
