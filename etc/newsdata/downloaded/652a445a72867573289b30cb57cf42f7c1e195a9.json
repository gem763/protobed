This is a deep state operative, pure and simple.\u201d\n\nWallace attempted to move past Miller\u2019s name-calling and combativeness, saying that was \u201cenough of the rhetoric,\u201d but the White House senior adviser continued to play for an audience of one and offer a full-throated defense of Trump\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how you can ask the question while at the same time admonishing the president or wanting to get to the bottom of perhaps one of the biggest corruption scandals concerning Ukraine in the last few years,\u201d Miller complained at one point.\n\nWallace, for his part, attempted to keep Miller on track, asking Miller why the president was going against his State Department and the Pentagon when it came to withholding military aid to Ukraine around the time of his call with the Ukrainian president.\n\nMiller grumbled about Wallace\u2019s judgmental \u201ctone\u201d while deflecting the Fox host\u2019s question before describing Trump as a hero looking to expose the truth on the Bidens.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the president\u2019s job and sworn duty to safeguard taxpayer dollars and the United States government\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d Miller huffed. \u201cGetting to the bottom of a corruption scandal in Ukraine is in the American national interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if you want to understand why that complaint is so obviously politically biased, when he says that the president is threatening national security by trying to expose corruption\u2014when he says, or she, that the president is hurting national security by trying to get to the bottom of a gigantic scandal that nobody has unearthed,\u201d he added. \u201cThe president is the whistleblower here! The President of the United States is the whistleblower. And this individual is a saboteur trying to undermine a democratically elected government!\u201d\n\nWallace would go on to note that the former Ukrainian prosecutor general has repeatedly said that there is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden or his son Hunter.", "description": "During a terse back and forth with Fox News Sunday\u2019s Chris Wallace, Miller added: \u201cAnd this individual is a saboteur trying to undermine a democratically elected government!\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569772426/fox-news-sunday-chris-wallace_5_kavykq", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
