He recently moved his family to the countryside for a bit of peace, quiet and safety\n\nHe recently moved his family to the countryside for a bit of peace, quiet and safety.\n\nIt seems, however, that there\u2019s a minor obstacle in the way of Noel Gallagher living his dream rural life \u2013 a family of tiny bats.\n\nEcologists have discovered an active roost in the roof of his \u00a38million seven-bedroom mansion in Hampshire.\n\nIt has forced the Oasis star, whose hits include Don\u2019t Look Back In Anger and Wonderwall, to be particularly careful as he carries out plans to renovate the impressive property.\n\nThe family have even been told to switch off all lights on the first floor until they are replaced \u2013 because they are \u2018emitting light and high frequency noise into the roof void\u2019.\n\nPlanning documents show Gallagher wants to remove a wall on the first floor of the property and rearrange internal partitions to create an enlarged dressing room and en-suite bathrooms.\n\nAn ecologist was asked to report on whether any protected species \u2013 specifically bats \u2013 could be disturbed by the work.\n\nFollowing several visits, which included analysing bat droppings and looking for evidence of food, the ecologist concluded: \u2018The building was found to have been used by at least one species of bat (brown long-eared) and DNA testing has shown previous use by this species.\n\nEcologists have discovered an active roost in the roof of his \u00a38million seven-bedroom mansion in Hampshire. It has forced the Oasis star to be particularly careful as he carries out plans to renovate the impressive property\n\nGallagher bought the mansion, which has a swimming pool, tennis court and library, in May this year. With views across rolling countryside, the impressive property also features a croquet lawn and an adjoining cottage\n\n\u2018The building is characterised as a current and active bat roost. All species of bat in the UK are fully protected by both domestic and European legislation, and therefore safe working practices are required in order to ensure their needs are taken into account.\u2019\n\nThe ecologist states that no work should be carried out between November and March \u2018to avoid any disturbance to bats hibernating in the roof\u2019.\n\nIn addition, no more than four hours of work should be carried out each day and no radios are to be played by workmen.\n\nTo resolve the issue of light and noise spilling into the roof, he writes: \u2018Until such time as the issue of the noise and light spilling into the roof void from the first floor ceiling lights has been resolved they are to remain switched off at all times.\u2019\n\nThe family have even been told to switch off all lights on the first floor until they are replaced \u2013 because they are \u2018emitting light and high frequency noise into the roof void\u2019\n\nGallagher bought the mansion, which has a swimming pool, tennis court and library, in May this year.\n\nWith views across rolling countryside, the impressive property also features a croquet lawn and an adjoining cottage.\n\nThe 52-year-old, who was raised in an inner city area of Manchester, decided he needed to move his wife Sara MacDonald and three children to the countryside because of fears for their safety.\n\n\u2018We didn\u2019t want the kids growing up in London,\u2019 he said earlier this year. One guy was multiple stabbed [sic] in the middle of the f****** day and an air ambulance had to come and land in the middle of the street and all the streets were taped off.\n\n\u2018Our lad is 11 and is now coming to go to secondary school and we were just saying it would be too f****** stressful if he is on the Tube and he is coming home and he is being mugged for his phone.\u2019\n\nUntil their recent move, the family lived in a six-bedroom property in north-west London which Gallagher put on the market for \u00a37.95million.\n\nA spokesman for Gallagher declined to comment.", "description": "The roost has forced the Oasis star, whose hits include Don't Look Back In Anger and Wonderwall, to be particularly careful as he carries out plans to renovate the impressive property in Hampshire.", "authors": ["Xantha Leatham For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/21/20255614-0-image-a-24_1572210386394.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
