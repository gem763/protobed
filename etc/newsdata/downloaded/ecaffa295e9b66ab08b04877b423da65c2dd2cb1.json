So the guy in the back seat started escalating by starting, like, choking him. They started like, punching each other. And then I had to stop because of that \u2026 it was crazy,\u201d said the driver who identified himself only as Randy.\n\n\"I had to stop because it was distracting my driving,\" Randy continued.\n\nKABC\n\nOfficers arrived on scene shortly after receiving the call and conducted a traffic break on the westbound side of the freeway, according to KABC.\n\nThen, according to the driver, one of the men jumped out of the car and started running across the lanes of traffic.\n\nIt was then that a police car driving down the other side of the highway to respond to the Uber\u2019s distress call struck and killed the man as he ran across the freeway.\n\n\u201cOne of the Uber passengers jumped the concrete center divider wall \u2026 and collided with a patrol vehicle, so the pedestrian was basically running across traffic lanes. The patrol vehicle collided with that passenger,\u201d said California Highway Police Officer Weston Haver.\n\nThe Uber driver said he picked up the two men in West Hollywood and that they did not seem drunk at the time of the argument.\n\nPictures from the scene of the accident show a heavily damaged patrol car but authorities report that the officer driving the vehicle was uninjured in the accident.\n\nThe man who was killed has yet to be indentified but has been described by authorities as a male adult in his 30s. All eastbound lanes on the 101 Freeway were shut down for around 7 hours while authorities conducted their investigation causing major traffic jams and major delays for many motorists.", "description": "An Uber passenger who got into a physical altercation with another rider was struck and killed by a California highway patrol car after jumping from the Uber.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/uber-strike-2-ht-ps-191015_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
