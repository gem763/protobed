Hohn. It said he was told he can't leave mainland China until the investigation is finished.\n\n\"We are working with the appropriate authorities to gain a better understanding of the facts,\" a FedEx Corp. spokeswoman said in a statement sent to The Associated Press.\n\nFedEx, headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, has been caught up in U.S.-Chinese trade tension.\n\nThis year, Chinese technology giant Huawei complained about deliveries that FedEx misrouted.
