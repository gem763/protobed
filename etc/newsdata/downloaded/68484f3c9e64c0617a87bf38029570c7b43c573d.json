He was later charged with \u201cpicking quarrels and provoking trouble,\u201d a vague offence often given to dissidents.\n\nAccording to Wang\u2019s mother and lawyer, he died on Monday. Wang\u2019s wife Cao Shuxia received a call from police notifying her that her husband had died at a military hospital in the city of Hengyang where he had been held. The police officer on the phone did not offer any explanation of the cause of death.\n\nDeath of 'barefoot lawyer' puts focus on China's treatment of political prisoners Read more\n\nAccording to Minsheng Guancha, a Chinese human rights group, Cao was later able to see Wang\u2019s body and saw he was bleeding from his eyes, mouth, ears and nose and there were bruises on his face.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese government must investigate allegations of torture and the death in detention of human rights activist Wang Meiyu and hold the perpetrators of torture and extrajudicial killing criminally accountable,\u201d the Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Radio Free Asia, Cao said police pressured her to accept their statement that Wang\u2019s death had been an accident but she refused. An officer at the Hengyang police station said he could not comment on the case. Wang\u2019s mother told the Guardian the family has been offered compensation of more than 2 million yuan (about $220,000).\n\n\u201cGiving compensation without an investigation or criminal accountability for the perpetrator is not true redress nor will it effectively prevent torture,\u201d said Frances Eve, deputy director of research at CHRD.\n\n\u201cEspecially when a family has effectively been held hostage and thus likely coerced into giving up claims for investigation for the compensation.\u201d\n\nWang\u2019s death follows after those of other activists including grassroots lawyer Ji Sizun, who died in police custody in July, Uighur scholar Muhammad Salih Hajim who died last year. Nobel laureate winner Liu Xiaobo who was denied cancer treatment died in 2017 while serving an 11-year-prison sentence and activist Cao Shunli died in 2014, detained after attempting to attend a UN session on human rights in China.\n\nSince Monday, Wang\u2019s family has been placed under house arrest, according to CHRD. He has two young children. Others connected to his case have also come under pressure. Late on Wednesday, six armed police detained Xie Yang, a rights lawyer, and Chen Yanhui, an activist, who had met at a hotel to discuss Wang\u2019s case. They were released on Thursday.\n\nWang, who began his work as an activist when his home was forcibly demolished, has been detained and claimed to have suffered torture before.\n\nIn 2018 after he held up the placard calling for Xi\u2019s resignation, he wrote online of how police stormed into his home, ordering him to write a confession letter and a statement promising he would stop.\n\n\u201cThese idiots. They can\u2019t understand that even after these years of persecution, including being deprived of water for three days or suffering two hours of electrical needles that caused me to vomit blood, I won\u2019t surrender.\u201d", "description": "Wang Meiyu was detained and charged after calling for Xi Jinping\u2019s resignation and universal suffrage", "authors": ["Lily Kuo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a44c4961c8e5fe99b1d0c5a35ec1ec2d5ad23862/0_55_824_494/master/824.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=372367153383f1bf48a189359c0e0bf0", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
