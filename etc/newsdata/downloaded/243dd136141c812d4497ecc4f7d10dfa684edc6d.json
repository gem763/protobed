USA TODAY\n\nThe New York Yankees are synonymous with the Fall Classic.\n\nJust not this decade.\n\nThe Bronx Bombers have reached the World Series 40 times in their history, winning 27 titles, by far more than any other major league team.\n\nBut in the 2010s, even a trip to the World Series has eluded the iconic franchise.\n\nThis is first decade in which the Yankees didn't reached the World Series since the 1910s.\n\nIt's not from a lack of trying. They have lost the American League Championship Series four consecutive times \u2013 in 2010, 2012, 2017 and 2019 \u2013 tying the longest streak in MLB history. The first two were losses to the Texas Rangers and the Detroit Tigers, while the two most recent exits were courtesy of the Houston Astros.\n\nYankees closer Aroldis Chapman gives up a game-winning two-run homer to Jose Altuve in the ninth inning.

Their 56.9 win percentage from 2010-19 during regular-season leads the majors. And it's not a far reach from when they won four championships in five years from 1996-2000.\n\n\"Sports can be a little bit cruel for the team that goes home,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said after Game 6.\n\n\"We'll continue to try and close that gap or put ourselves in a position to get over the hump. I know everyone in our room believes we will and we'll have a lot of battle scars when we do finally get to the top of that mountain.\"\n\n#Yankees World Series appearances by decade:\n\n\n\n1920-29: 6 (3-3)\n\n1930-39: 5 (5-0)\n\n1940-49: 5 (4-1)\n\n1950-59: 8 (6-2)\n\n1960-69: 5 (2-3)\n\n1970-79: 3 (2-1)\n\n1980-89: 1 (0-1)\n\n1990-99: 3 (3-0)\n\n2000-09: 4 (2-2)\n\n2010-19: NONE \u2014 Greg Brady (@gregbradyTO) October 20, 2019", "description": "This is first decade in which the Yankees have not reached the World Series since the 1910s.", "authors": ["Scott Boeck", "Published A.M.
