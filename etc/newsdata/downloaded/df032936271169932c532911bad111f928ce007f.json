He told the doctors 'I'm not moving, I'm just sitting still'.\n\n\"Not to get anyone sent off, he was just using his nous.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nJames also played down the incident and told Sky Sports he had not lost consciousness in his first-half collision with Vida.\n\n\"There was a few tackles flying in but you always expect it in these games,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm fine. I think he just caught me in the head but I didn't get knocked out fortunately.\"\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nAfter falling behind in the first 10 minutes of the match, Gareth Bale scored an equaliser to keep Wales hopes of qualifying from Group E alive.\n\nThe Real Madrid forward scored his 33rd goal for his country in the final moments of the first half after Nikola Vlasic put Croatia ahead within the first 10 minutes.\n\nIf Slovakia fail to collect more than four points from their final two group games, Wales will be able to secure qualification with wins over Azerbaijan and Hungary.\n\n(Image: Alex Davidson/Getty Images)\n\n\"We showed character coming back, we didn't panic,\" Giggs said.\n\n\"We showed commitment, but quality as well. I don't get a lot of time with them, but what they showed doesn't surprise me as I see the quality in training.\n\n\"We have played two teams, Slovakia and now Croatia, who can hurt you.\n\n\"But it's credit to them, we gave them the information and it's a step forward.\"", "description": "The Manchester United winger was on the floor for several minutes after a heavy challenge from Croatia's Domagoj Vida which appeared to knock him unconscious", "authors": ["Hassan Rashed", "Image", "Empics Sport", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Alex Davidson Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20574389.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Wales-v-Croatia-UEFA-Euro-2020-Qualifier.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
