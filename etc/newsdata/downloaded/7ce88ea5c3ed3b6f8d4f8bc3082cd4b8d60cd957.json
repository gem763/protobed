Poverty forced Sabir, 11, to flee home and sell dried fruits on Kabul\u2019s streets. Niyamathullah, 9, hangs out in a park, looking for work.\n\nSuch is the lot of many a child in Afghanistan, which this week passes another sombre milestone. On Monday, the conflict turned 18, meaning every single Afghan child now has known only war.\n\n\u201cPeace is like a dream to us in Afghanistan,\u201d said Mohammad Mobin, a 17-year-old Kabul high schooler. \u201cAfghanistan can develop only if we have peace.\u201d\n\nOn October 7, 2001, the United States launched air strikes against Afghanistan, following the September 11 attacks conducted by Al-Qaeda that killed nearly 3,000 people in the US.\n\nThe Taliban, who had refused to hand over Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, were toppled within weeks, but the ensuing insurgent conflict has dragged on ever since and become the longest war in US history.\n\nViolence has only worsened in recent years, disproportionately impacting children.\n\n\u201cSince we were born, we have had no peace in our country, it has only been fighting and conflict,\u201d said Sayed Ibrahim, an 18-year-old medical student in Kabul.\n\nThe UN published a report last week saying that from 2015 to 2018, researchers studying the plight of Afghan kids documented more than 14,000 grave violations against them throughout the country, marking a sharp increase from the previous four years.\n\n\u201cImagine turning 18 having known nothing but conflict and war throughout your entire childhood and formative years,\u201d said Onno van Manen, country director for Save the Children in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cLife in Afghanistan means living in daily fear of explosions, missing school because it\u2019s too unsafe and not knowing if your parents or siblings will make it home.\u201d\n\nThe UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) says the number of attacks against Afghan schools tripled last year compared to 2017. By the end of 2018, more than 1,000 Afghan schools had been shut due to conflict.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t study because I have no money, I have to make money to support my family,\u201d said Sabir, an 11-year-old boy who fled his home province of Ghazni to sell peanuts, sunflower seeds and dried fruits in central Kabul.\n\n\u201cWe have to go to school and get an education. We can end fighting through education.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018No proper jobs\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe 2001 invasion did herald some enduring improvements for many young Afghans \u2014 particularly girls, who had been banned from receiving an education under the Taliban.\n\nIn Kabul and other urban centres, schools and universities flourished, and an entire generation of children now has never known Taliban rule.\n\nBut the economy remains so weak that poorer families often yank their kids from school and send them to hustle for extra cash on dangerous streets.\n\nJobs for many youths are so scarce they have few options but to try to emigrate, or join the Taliban or other insurgent groups who pay a regular wage.\n\nDuring a recent visit to a busy park in downtown Kabul, nine-year-old Niyamathullah told AFP he would do anything for work \u2014 sell gum, wash cars, run errands.\n\nHameedullah, the 13-year-old shoe shiner, said he would have stayed in school but needed to raise money for his family.\n\n\u201cThere is no peace, the fighting is ongoing, there are no proper jobs for us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI would like to go to school, get an education and work for my country.\u201d\n\nAccording to the UN Population Fund, 42 percent of Afghanistan\u2019s population is aged under 14. UNICEF says more than 3.7 million children are currently out of school \u2014 most of them girls.\n\nThe US and the Taliban had spent the past year negotiating a deal that could have led to talks between the Islamists and the Afghan government \u2014 and an eventual ceasefire \u2014 but President Donald Trump scuttled the agreement at the last moment, citing concerns over Taliban violence.\n\nThe Taliban released a statement Monday to mark the October 7 anniversary, saying America had been \u201cbrought down to its knees in Afghanistan\u201d.\n\nThe date \u201cshould be another reminder for all the enemies of Afghanistan that no one can ever forcefully subdue Afghans and take their sovereignty and independence,\u201d the Taliban wrote.", "description": "Kabul (AFP) \u2013 Afghanistan\u2019s war cost 13-year-old shoe shiner Hameedullah his education.
