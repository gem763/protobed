I don't think it's what Diana would have wanted'", "language": "en", "text": "A couple of days after Diana\u2019s death, Richard Branson called me. He told me when people signed the book of condolence at St James\u2019s Palace, a lot of them were writing down quotations from the lyrics of Candle In The Wind. Apparently, it was being played a lot on the radio as well.\n\nHe asked if I\u2019d be prepared to rewrite the lyrics and sing it at the funeral. I think he\u2019d been contacted by the Spencer family, because they felt the funeral should be something that people would really connect to.\n\nSo I called Bernie [Taupin], who\u2019d written the original lyrics. He was fantastic: he acted as if writing a song that the Queen and the Archbishop of Canterbury had to check through first was all in a day\u2019s work and faxed the altered lyrics over the next morning.\n\nFocused: Elton John performing at Princess Diana's funeral at Westminster Abbey\n\nI insisted on having a teleprompter by the piano, with Bernie\u2019s new lyrics on it. Up until then, I\u2019d been against their use.\n\nPartly because it seemed antithetical to rock and roll\u2019s spontaneous spirit \u2014 I\u2019m pretty sure Little Richard wasn\u2019t reading off an Autocue when he recorded Long Tall Sally \u2014 and partly because I just thought: Come on, do your job properly.\n\nYou\u2019ve only got three things to do onstage \u2014 sing in tune, play the right notes and remember the words. If you can only be bothered to do two of them you may as well find another job instead.\n\nBut this time, I relaxed the rules. It was a unique experience. There was a sense in which it was the biggest gig of my life \u2014 for four minutes, I was literally going to be the centre of the world\u2019s attention \u2014 but equally, it wasn\u2019t an Elton John moment, it wasn\u2019t about me at all.\n\nWilliam and Harry with Earl Spencer and Prince Charles at the funeral service in 1997\n\nWe were seated in the inner sanctum of the church, right where the Royal Family came in. William and Harry looked completely shell-shocked. They were 15 and 12, and I thought the way they were treated that day was absolutely inhuman.\n\nThey were forced to walk through the streets of London behind their mother\u2019s coffin, told to show no emotion and look straight ahead. It was a horrendous way to treat two kids who\u2019d just lost their mum.\n\nBut I barely took any of it in. I wasn\u2019t suffering from stage fright, more a very specific fear: What if I went into autopilot and sang the wrong version?\n\nI\u2019d performed Candle In The Wind hundreds of times. It wasn\u2019t beyond the realms of possibility that I might lose myself in the performance, forget about the teleprompter and start singing the original lyrics.\n\nHow bad would it be if I did that? Appalling. Huge chunks of the lyrics were completely inappropriate for the occasion.\n\nYou\u2019d have a hard time bluffing your way out of singing about Marilyn Monroe being found dead in the nude, or how your feelings were something more than sexual, at a state funeral.\n\nElton with Princess Diana at a television awards ceremony in 1993\n\nBut one lesson I\u2019ve learned is that sometimes, you just have to step up to the plate, even if the plate is miles outside your comfort zone. You forget about whatever emotions you may have, and think: No, I\u2019m a performer. This is what I do. Get on with it.\n\nSo I got on with it. I don\u2019t remember much about the performance itself, but I remember the applause afterwards.\n\nIt seemed to start outside Westminster Abbey and sweep inside, which I guess meant that Diana\u2019s family had achieved their aim: the song connected with the people outside.\n\nAfter the funeral, I went straight to a studio in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, where George Martin was waiting: they were going to release the new version of Candle In The Wind as a single to raise money for a charity set up in Diana\u2019s name. I sang it twice and went home.\n\nMe: Elton John Official Autobiography by Elton John is published by Macmillan on October 15, \u00a325. \u00a9 Elton John 2019\n\nWhen I got there, David was standing in the kitchen, watching the coverage on TV. The funeral cort\u00e8ge had got to the M1: people were throwing flowers at Diana\u2019s hearse from the bridges over the motorway.\n\nThat was when I finally broke down.\n\nI hadn\u2019t felt able to show emotion all day. I\u2019d had a job to do, and how I felt about Diana\u2019s death might have interfered with my ability to do it.\n\nThe funeral version of Candle In The Wind became the biggest-selling single since the charts began. There was part of me that couldn\u2019t understand why anyone would want to listen to it.\n\nUnder what circumstances would you play it? I never did. I listened back to it once at the studio to OK the mix and that was it: never again.\n\nIn the end, I started feeling really uncomfortable with the single\u2019s longevity. Its success meant there was footage of Diana\u2019s funeral week after week on Top Of The Pops \u2014 it almost felt like wallowing in her death, as if the mourning for her had got out of hand. I really didn\u2019t think that was what Diana would have wanted.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t want to do anything to prolong it any further. So when Oprah Winfrey asked me on her talk show to discuss the funeral, I said no.\n\nThe Diana version of Candle In The Wind has never been included on any Greatest Hits album I\u2019ve put out, and it\u2019s never been re-released.\n\nI\u2019ve always tried to avoid the topic with journalists. It wasn\u2019t that I wanted to forget it \u2014 or her. I just wanted life to get back to some semblance of normality.\n\nFocused: Elton performing at Diana\u2019s funeral.
