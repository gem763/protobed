I am sure President Trump knows very well the history of the Turks and the history of [Turkish President Recep] Erdogan, and he knows very well what happened and what is happening,\u201d Ms. Abdullah told The Times in an interview conducted through a translator.\n\n\u201cWe consider the U.S. also responsible [for] these injuries because they gave permission to the Turkish state to come to the area, and the Turkish state will commit massacres,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really don\u2019t want war.\u201d\n\nThe Times\u2019 interview with Ms. Abdullah was interrupted for over an hour after an apparent attack by Turkish forces in the area. She said she\u2019s unsure of how many people have been hurt but \u201cthe number is increasing every moment.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish military Thursday ramped up its bombing and artillery attacks on the SDF, a key U.S. ally in the years-long fight against the Islamic State. The Turkish military is currently bringing more heavy weapons and military reinforcements to the area, SDF officials said.\n\nMs. Abdullah also said that Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to remove U.S. special operations forces from a buffer zone along the Turkey-Syria border \u2014 a move announced earlier this week after the president spoke with Mr. Erdogan late Sunday \u2014 will lead to the release of thousands of Islamic State fighters currently in SDF custody. An Islamic State resurgence and subsequent threat to the Middle East and Europe, she said, will be the fault of Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThere are thousands and tens of thousands of ISIS families and ISIS members here in the region in the prison and in the camps,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd such a decision will open the door in front of ISIS to reorganize themselves and take revenge [on] the people of the region and take revenge from the European people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want him to know that he\u2019s responsible [for] the life of 7 million civilian people who are now living in the area,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Trump has come under withering bipartisan fire at home for his decision to pull U.S. special forces back from the border, but the president has defended the move as part of his broader pledge to get the U.S. out of \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East.\n\nThe U.S. still has about 1,000 ground troops in Syria, but the White House made the decision that American forces cannot get caught in the middle of a battle between Turkey and the SDF.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
