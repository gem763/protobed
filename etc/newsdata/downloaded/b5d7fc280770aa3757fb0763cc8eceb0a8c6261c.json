There were a couple of dozen syringes and seven to eight vials.\"\n\nBut he does think Akram went too far in describing the problem: \"Saying that medical waste was spread over kilometers was incorrect. It was at one portion of the beach, not the entire beach. Saying that medical waste was spread over kilometers could create panic among people.\"\n\nOn September 3, the Sindh Police, the law enforcement agency in Karachi, reported that it \"cordoned off the affected area.\" And on September 5 the government appointed a commissioner to investigate, calling for a report within seven days.\n\nDr. Jehanzeb Mughal, a surgeon who runs a clinic in Karachi, has theories about what might have happened \u2013 and to him it wasn't a matter of quantity but rather figuring out the back story: \"The question is, how did it get there?\"\n\nHis theory is that \"someone has all the plastic stuff in his clinical waste ready to be shipped off to some buyer, who will then make a plastic product out of it.\" Along the way, he suggests, \"there wasn't a proper disposal system\" for hazardous waste, \"so it got picked up and obviously got dumped into the sea and then ended up on the shore\" when the tide came in.\n\nAkram, who says she's walked that beach every day for four years and never seen syringes before, is happy with the outcome. She told NPR: \"Karachi has experienced a major wake-up call this week. The people of Karachi have had enough, and that is why the reaction was so good \u2013 a full investigation into dumping and disposal of medical waste is underway.\"\n\nHer fans on Twitter agree:\n\nAnd one tweet urges her to enter the political arena:\n\nBenazir Samad is a journalist from Pakistan currently in the U.S. as part of the Hubert H. Humphrey Fellowship Program, a Fulbright program that is sponsored by the U.S. State Department.
