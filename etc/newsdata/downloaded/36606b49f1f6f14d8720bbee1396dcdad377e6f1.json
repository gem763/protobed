But we can't let them have a nuclear weapon. So I think there is a really good chance we would meet.\"", "description": "\u2018Without the U.S.\u2019s withdrawal from sanctions, we will not witness any positive development.\u2019", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1041033332-1200x628.jpg"}
