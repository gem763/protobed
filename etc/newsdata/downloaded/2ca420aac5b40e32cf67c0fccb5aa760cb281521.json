Photo: Courtesy of the vendor\n\nLike many a person with F-cup breasts and fashion aspirations, I had long been tortured by the legend of the effective strapless bra. It was, as far as I could tell, a mirage. Some were nothing but hangers-on, less supportive than a corporate WhatsApp group. Some left painful, red welts in my side. Others felt like wearing a bulletproof vest under my party dress. Many fell down entirely. Most weren\u2019t even available above a 36DD, meaning the whole mission was pointless and I\u2019d slink off to buy a thermal poloneck instead. Where was my invite to off-the-shoulder club? Where was it?\n\nNext, it turns out. I\u2019d never have thought to go to Next for underwear. I\u2019d never have thought to go to Next for anything since I stopped needing tailored trousers for work experience \u2014 but thanks to a tip-off from Laura Craik in the Evening Standard, I finally found my holy grail.\n\nThe Jamie Non Padded Minimising DD+ Bandeau Bra is soft and comfortable but sturdy enough to stay up all day long. It\u2019s underwired but not padded, gravity-defying but without acres of superfluous cleavage. The smooth, seam-free design looks sleek and unfussy beneath clothes \u2014 no knobbly bows or bumpy lace. And while \u2018minimising\u2019 might raise a few body-positive eyebrows, it\u2019s hard to deny that the fashion climate is still fairly inhospitable to boobs. Sometimes you want to celebrate them; sometimes you just want to flatten them down and forget about them for a while. Hey, look at my shoulders instead! Or my eyes. Or my personality.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of the vendor Jamie Non Padded Minimising DD+ Bandeau Bra \u00a320 at Next Buy\n\nGoing up to a 38H, it isn\u2019t quite as size-inclusive as it could be. Available in black, white, and one stubbornly trad shade of peachy \u2018nude\u2019, it\u2019s not as inclusive as it could be. But given how often the Jamie sells out online, I\u2019m clearly not the only disciple \u2014 Next would do well to perk up, pay attention, and widen the range.\n\nWhile the Jamie is obviously a godsend during the summer, I wear it all through winter, too; its minimising powers work a treat under lightweight sweaters, high-necked dresses, form-fitting thermal polonecks (I have lots), and any other outfit where I\u2019d rather keep the girls under wraps. I\u2019ve worn it several times a week since I first discovered it in 2015, and if it\u2019s ever discontinued, I will riot. It washes and wears brilliantly \u2014 I\u2019m still wearing the same black Jamie that I bought four years ago, which goes some way to offsetting the brand\u2019s lack of sustainable kudos.\n\n\u2018But is it pretty?\u2019 you ask. No! Not in the slightest! It looks like a surgical bandage. But I\u2019ve been shopping for too long to expect every purchase to tick every box. More importantly, it hugs me like an old friend, and supports me like a partner. It has unlocked outfits that I never thought I\u2019d be able to wear without throwing caution \u2014 and nipple \u2014 to the wind. Sometimes your boobs deserve to swing freely in the breeze, sometimes they deserve to be showcased in lace, and sometimes they just want to be held snugly, by a piece of reliable engineering that has their back.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
