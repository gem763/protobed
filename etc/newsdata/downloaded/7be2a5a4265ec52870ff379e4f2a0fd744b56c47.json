Meanwhile, the race will not be staged on Monday if the cars are unable to run on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThey are doing the utmost they can,\u201d said championship leader Hamilton. \u201cI am sure they are preparing, are aware that it is coming, and have procedures in place.\u201d\n\nSebastian Vettel echoed Hamilton\u2019s comments. The four-time world champion said: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody wants to put lives in danger. There is a forecast, but how many times has a forecast changed?\n\n\u201cWe will see what happens as the weekend goes on. It makes sense that when we have more evidence tomorrow night to put together a proposal or an action for qualifying then.\u201d\n\nA statement from the FIA read: \u201cEvery effort is being made to minimise disruption to the Formula One timetable.\n\n\u201cHowever the safety of the fans, competitors and everyone at the Suzuka Circuit remains the top priority. All parties will continue to monitor the situation and provide further updates in due course.\u201d\n\nThe race in Japan has been hit by bad weather in the past, with qualifying staged on Sunday morning on two occasions, in 2004 and 2010. Four years ago, qualifying for the US Grand Prix was pushed back a day due to heavy rain.\n\n\u201cI am happy for them to do that,\u201d added Hamilton, who holds a 73-point championship lead over Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas with 130 available.\n\n\u201cIt is cool when the format changes. You have to enter into two different mindsets, and two different rhythms. It is a different challenge so I like that.\n\n\u201cIt is intense here when it rains, but I love driving in the wet. It doesn\u2019t make a difference to me. It is quite exciting.\u201d", "description": "Lewis Hamilton has backed Formula One\u2019s decision to delay whether it will make changes to this weekend\u2019s storm-threatened Japanese Grand Prix.
