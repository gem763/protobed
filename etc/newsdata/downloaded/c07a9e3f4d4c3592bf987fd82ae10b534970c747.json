Insurers that provide these plans receive payments from Medicare to cover costs.\n\nAbout 34 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. That\u2019s more than 22 million individuals \u2013 a number that is expected to grow as more baby boomers retire.\n\nDuring a Thursday visit to the retirement community The Villages in Flordia, one of the nation's largest, Trump told the crowd the plan would be watered down by the Democrats.\n\nParticipating insurance companies can choose to offer Medicare MSA Plans, which are similar to health savings accounts (HSAs), and combine a high-deductible plan alongside a special savings account.\n\nThe Medicare MSA Plan puts a certain amount of money into the account each year, which can be used to pay for care costs before the deductible is met \u2013 including care that is not covered by Medicare. Enrollees cannot deposit their own money.\n\nLike health savings accounts, withdrawals are not taxed if they are used for \u201cqualified medical expenses.\u201d\n\nIf those funds are used up, an individual will pay out-of-pocket until the deductible is met. Money not used at the end of the year will roll over \u2013 and funds grow tax-free while accruing interest.\n\nThe plans, however, do not cover Part D prescription drug costs.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, only about 5,600 people are enrolled in Medicare MSAs in 2019.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump announced his plan to expand private-sector Medicare coverage by providing more plan choices to seniors, bolstering telehealth services, lowering Medicare Advantage costs and protecting the program from Democrats\u2019 plans to expand it into Medicare for All.\n\nA study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that Medicare beneficiaries who enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan spend less and use fewer services before they make the switch when compared to those that remain in Medicare.\n\nMedicare alone accounted for 15 percent of government spending in fiscal 2016, according to data from the Pew Research Center. Other health programs made up 13 percent.\n\nAbout 64 million people were covered by Medicare in 2019.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Funds can be withdrawn tax-free so long as they are used for qualified medical expenses.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Trump-medicare.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
