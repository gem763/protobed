To a wider extent the families have certainly been apprised and close family liaison has occurred today,\u201d Supt Lindsay said.\n\n\u201cI can confirm a 77-year-old male and a 68-year-old female are believed to be the people that have died at this premises.\u201d\n\nNSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons described it as a tragic end to the search.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible outcome,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Fitzsimmons said the couple\u2019s bodies were found inside a \u201csignificantly damaged\u201d home and confirmed no other people remained unaccounted for.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a remote, relatively isolated place that\u2019s been heavily impacted by fire,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, NSW RFS Inspector Ben Shepherd said authorities \u201cstarted off with around about a dozen people that were unaccounted for\u201d.\n\nSupt Lindsay, speaking this morning in Rappville where at least 11 homes were lost, had said they were worried about a \u201cnumber of people\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe always hope for the best but we\u2019ve obviously got to treat it at its worst. We\u2019ve seen the devastation in town. It\u2019s a very large fire and it\u2019s still active,\u201d he said.\n\nRichmond Valley mayor Robert Mustow told ABC the loss of a local timber mill would hurt 30 employees and have a \u201cbig impact on our community\u201d.\n\nThe Brisbane-to-Sydney rail line has been cut and won\u2019t be operational again for an estimated five days, the mayor added.\n\nNSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance tweeted that stretches of the rail line had been damaged and the Rappville rail bridge destroyed.\n\nIt\u2019s believed the fire that ripped through the small village of Rappville on Tuesday afternoon may have been deliberately lit with NSW Emergency Services Minister David Elliott labelling the potential arson a \u201cbastard act\u201d.\n\nMr Fitzsimmons says in the absence of any other obvious cause the blaze is being treated as suspicious.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to call it out \u2014 it\u2019s a heinous crime, a criminal act,\u201d he told Nine.\n\nStrikeforce Cleander has been formed to investigate the cause of the fire.\n\nAcross the Busbys Flat and Drake fires \u2014 which joined together in recent days and burned 115,000 hectares \u2014 at least 21 homes have been destroyed. Fifteen were in the Rappville area while the remainder were impacted by the Drake blaze.\n\nMr Fitzsimmons said 34 bushfires continue to burn across NSW, eight of which remain out of control. However, all fires are currently at the lower \u201cadvice\u201d alert level after a number of emergency warnings were downgraded on Wednesday.\n\nAllan Robertson lost his Rappville home and was left with the clothes he was wearing, his phone and \u201cmy worst thongs\u201d.\n\nHe said he was uninsured and his partner was in palliative care. \u201cIt was just like a massive fireball. There was nothing you could do. The heat was horrendous,\u201d he told Ten on Wednesday.\n\nThe NSW RFS said a number of residents were treated for minor burns and breathing difficulties.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday said the Federal Government will provide \u201cwhatever assistance is necessary\u201d.\n\nThe RFS says residents likely won\u2019t be able to return home for a number of days given trees are down across roads and powerlines are on the ground. The fire service also warned that even though better conditions were forecast today, blazes could flare again.\n\n\u2014 with AAP", "description": "Human remains have been found in the search for two residents missing in northern NSW after a bushfire.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d4ae9ab89dbdd1254eb83e44066240d9?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
