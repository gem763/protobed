There, up to 36 per cent of children have not received the two MMR jabs recommended by the NHS by their fifth birthday.\n\nLast night, experts warned of a \u2018middle class rejection\u2019 of the vaccine in the worst affected areas, with parents wrongly having doubts over the safety of the jabs \u2013 or being too busy for GP appointments.\n\nThere are up to 36 per cent of children who have not received the two MMR jabs recommended by the NHS by their fifth birthday in the South East including Surrey and the London boroughs of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, according to new figures (file image)\n\nMeasles cases have soared, with the disease striking 991 children last year \u2013 treble the 2017 total. Official figures analysed by the Mail reveal that across Europe only France has more children without protection against the disease\n\nOther doctors however, suggested the trends were more complicated. Yesterday, the Mail launched a major campaign to improve the uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab alongside all childhood immunisations.\n\nThis newspaper is urging ministers to launch a national awareness drive to inform parents that vaccines are safe, and most importantly, save lives. Last night, the campaign received a major boost as Health Secretary Matt Hancock hailed the \u2018great\u2019 initiative and the head of the NHS, Simon Stevens, praised our coverage.\n\nThe Mail was spurred into action by a report two weeks ago which revealed uptake had fallen for all ten childhood jabs, including measles, polio and meningitis.\n\nHealth officials are particularly worried about the decline in uptake of the MMR vaccine after measles cases trebled in just one year.\n\nThe 'well-nourished, middle class might think they\u2019re not necessarily going to come to harm' and this means many do not get vaccinations, according to Dr Doug Brown, of the British Society for Immunology. And yesterday, the Mail launched a major campaign to improve the uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab alongside all childhood immunisations.\n\nThe NHS recommends that children are given two shots of the MMR vaccine at 12 months and when they are three. Youngsters who miss either jab are much more likely to get measles.\n\nThe Mail analysed the latest figures for 2018/19 from NHS Digital to reveal the areas of England with the worst uptake.\n\nWestminster had the lowest uptake rate, with 36 per cent of children not having received the two MMR jabs by their fifth birthday.\n\nIn the east London borough of Hackney, only 34 per cent had been given both doses while the figure in Kensington and Chelsea was 33 per cent. In middle class Kingston-Upon-Thames, 25 per cent of children missed both MMR doses while neighbouring Richmond reported a rate of 24 per cent.\n\nGraphic shows where jab uptakes are the lowest across London (top) and the UK as a whole (bottom)\n\nThe figure for affluent Surrey was 21 per cent. However, uptake was also poor in Newham in east London, Luton in Bedfordshire and Birmingham. Some experts believe a \u2018middle class rejection of vaccination\u2019 is to blame for the low rates of uptake in the worst areas, although others believe the reasons are more complicated.\n\nProfessor Jonathan Ball, an immunisation expert from the University of Nottingham said: \u2018There\u2019s still an underlying \u2018anti-vaxx\u2019 sentiment over whether it\u2019s healthy to keep giving your children more and more immunisations, even though the evidence is out there.\n\n\u2018A lot of it is to do with convenience... In many, many households both parents are working and if the vaccination requires a visit to the GP surgery for a nurse or a doctor to give the immunisation, you do wonder whether it\u2019s a high priority.\u2019\n\nProfessor John Ashton, ex-president of the Faculty of Public Health, warned of a \u2018middle class rejection of vaccination\u2019. The well-nourished, middle class might think they\u2019re not necessarily going to come to harm,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018That wasn\u2019t necessarily the case when it was common to have epidemics of measles every two years in the 1950s. There would be deafness and brain damage and death in middle class children.\u2019\n\nHowever, Professor Helen Bedford, an expert in children\u2019s health at University College London said the areas highlighted in the Mail\u2019s analysis have a mixture of social groups. \u2018You get very rich people, who might be getting their vaccinations privately, and that information doesn\u2019t get into NHS figures,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018But those areas also have pockets of extreme deprivation.\u2019 Dr David Elliman, a consultant in community child health at London\u2019s Great Ormond Street Hospital, said: \u2018There are people who reject vaccines in total. Those may be people who have different health belief systems, they don\u2019t go along with any orthodox medicine.\n\nProfessor John Ashton, ex-president of the Faculty of Public Health (pictured left), has warned of a \u2018middle class rejection of vaccination\u2019 while Dr Doug Brown, of the British Society for Immunology, said the reasons behind variation is 'complex'\n\n\u2018Then there are people who are hesitant, people who just want to know more, or who have had an experience that makes them there is a problem with a vaccine, for example a friend down the road who had a child who had the MMR and then got autism.\u2019\n\nDr Doug Brown, of the British Society for Immunology, said: \u2018The reasons behind this regional variation are complex.\u2019 He blamed a number of factors, including whether GP immunisation clinics were held at convenient times or if local NHS trusts sent out reminder letters.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock (pictured right, next to Britain's Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairn) is backing the Mail's campaign and said: \u2018I applaud this vital campaign from the Daily Mail \u2013 vaccines save lives, and we must all do whatever we can to ensure every child is properly protected'\n\nThe NHS figures, published two weeks ago, show that 14 per cent of children had not received both MMR jabs by their fifth birthday.\n\nDr Mary Ramsay, head of Immunisation at Public Health England, says they are 'delighted to have the Mail on-board'\n\nIt is the lowest national uptake since 2011/12. The Mail is urging the NHS to introduce a vaccination alert system\u2013 by text or letter \u2013 to remind parents of appointments.\n\nAnd the fall in uptake of the MMR comes at a time when measles is on the rise with 991 cases reported in 2018, treble the number in 2017.\n\nTwenty years ago vaccination rates for MMR plummeted when a study by doctor Andrew Wakefield linked the jab to autism.\n\nLike many news organisations, the Daily Mail gave coverage to his findings, which had been published in the highly respected medical journal, the Lancet.\n\nWakefield\u2019s claims were later found to be \u2018utterly false\u2019 and he was struck off the doctors\u2019 register.", "description": "Up to 36 per cent of children have not received MMR jabs in most expensive parts of England, according to figures.
