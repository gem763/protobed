What can you do to breathe more easily?\n\nHamilton Beach TrueAir Room Odor Eliminator traps dust and uses three carbon filters to eliminate odors, sending fresh air back into your home.\n\nWith odors from cooking, pets, our bodies, and the environment in general, our homes can be really smelly places. There are scented air fresheners that temporarily mask odors, but what we really need to do is eliminate them completely.\n\nSince most of us don't want to get rid of our loved ones (well, not permanently) or pets, we've put together a list of some of the best odor eliminators on the market. I started my testing by having a very good (and very honest) friend come into my home and give it a sniff. We all become used to the odors around us and can no longer detect them, but an outsider will catch that whiff of the litter box, last night's stuffed cabbage, or stale-smelling carpet.\n\nOur sense of smell is powerful and causes many reactions. Some odors are pleasant and evoke good memories and emotions; others cause distress. Malodors come from a variety of sources including bacteria (spoiled food and body odor), fungus (mold and mildew), and volatile organic compounds or VOCs (paint fumes). The secret is to find a way to eliminate the bad smells and keep a balance of pleasant scents that are not overwhelming.\n\nThe definition of clean is \"free from dirt, pollution, or pollutants.\" But maintaining a sterile home is impossible. Regular cleaning with disinfecting cleaners is the first step in maintaining an odor-free home. And, fortunately, there are products available that do a great job in eliminating odors. In my testing, I chose to focus on the toughest odors to control and the products that are the most effective, easiest to use, and offer the best value for your money. These are the tried-and-true products I've tested and recommend.\n\nHere are the best odor removers you can buy:\n\nUpdated on 10/15/19 by Les Shu: Updated prices, links, and formatting.", "description": "Dealing with all the different smells in your home requires different cleaning materials.
