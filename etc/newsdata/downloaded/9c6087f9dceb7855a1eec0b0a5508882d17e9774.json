Devin Duvernay caught eight passes for 173 yards to lead Texas.\n\nTexas (5-3, 3-2 in Big 12) began the game with a 21-yard field goal by Cameron Dicker, and Song answered with a 32-yard field goal.\n\nTCU moved to the front when Duggan found tight end Pro Wells down the seam for a 24-yard score that gave the Horned Frogs a 10-3 lead with 12:18 to play in the second quarter.\n\nEhlinger immediately responded, threading a perfect 47-yard touchdown pass to Duvernay to tie the game at 10-10 with 10:57 in the second quarter.\n\nEhlinger then passed to Keaontay Ingram for a 17-yard touchdown to give Texas a 17-10 lead. TCU's Griffin Kell ripped a 52-yard field goal on the final play of the second quarter to pull the Horned Frogs to within 17-13.\n\nEhlinger and Duvernay combined for a 63-yard catch and run to the TCU 6 early in the third quarter, leading to a 38-yard Dicker field goal and a 20-13 lead with 7:46 to play in the third quarter.\n\nThe Horned Frogs tied the game on their ensuing possession on a 1-yard touchdown run by Sewo Olonilua that came two snaps after a 51-yard pass from Duggan to Taye Barber that set the stage for the wild fourth quarter.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Max Duggan passed for a career-high 273 yards and threw two touchdowns tosses,  and TCU's defense made four interceptions to help the Horned Frogs hold off ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
