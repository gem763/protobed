They said that could cause some to avoid answering the survey, leading to an undercount that could affect government aid programs, especially in congressional districts represented by Democrats.\n\nThe Supreme Court blocked the move, and Census officials said the question will not be included in the 2020 questionnaire meant to measure the population, not just citizens.\n\nBut there may be continued anxiety about confidentially, considering the Census Bureau still sends out 3.5 million surveys every year called the American Community Survey (ACS), inquiring about citizenship status and employment.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, this information also is confidential and is collected to \u201cmeasure the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population.\u201d\n\nThe ACS, in addition to the decennial census, is conducted under federal law that protects all information collected.\n\nBecause this is the first year the Census Bureau will conduct the census in three ways -- phone, online and mail -- the Census Bureau addressed its commitment to the privacy of the information collected, regardless of how it is collected.\n\n\u201cEven though we are using technical options that we didn\u2019t have before, the commitment to confidentiality, the commitment to protect people\u2019s information hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Fernando Armstrong, Philadelphia regional director.\n\nSteven Dillingham, director of the U.S. Census Bureau, also explained that every household will receive a paper ballot if residents do not answer the census by internet or phone.", "description": "The Census Bureau on Tuesday reiterated that information collected in the 2020 census will be confidential, protected from local and federal law enforcement.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/census-ap-jt-190917_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
