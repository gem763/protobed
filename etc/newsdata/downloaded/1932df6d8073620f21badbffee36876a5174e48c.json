Nicholas Ennis says he\u2019s been driving around for about a year with the sticker displayed, but it wasn\u2019t until recently that he was told the sticker is \u201cobscene\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think my First Amendment rights have been violated because it\u2019s not spelled out like he said on the ticket,\u201d Ennis said. \u201cThat we should have the right to express our opinions, and the freedom of speech, and they\u2019re trying to take it away, the constitutional right, they\u2019re trying to take all that away from us, like American ain\u2019t free no more.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Sumner County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the sticker falls under a Tennessee law prohibiting \u201cobscene obscene or patently offensive bumper stickers, window signs, etc.\u201d The sticker in question, which features two rifles and the letters \u201cu\u201d and \u201cc\u201d above the phrase \u201cgun control\u201d, is a no-no because of the expletive spelled out with the firearms and the letters, or so says the sheriff.\n\nUCLA law professor Eugene Volokh, on the other hand, says it\u2019s the citation that\u2019s problematic, and says the attempt to police Ennis\u2019s sticker is clearly unconstitutional.\n\nBut of course this is constitutionally protected, given the Court\u2019s decision in Cohen v. California (1971) that a jacket bearing the words \u201cFuck the Draft\u201d was constitutionally protected. Indeed, it\u2019s not even barred by the relevant Tennessee statute (Tenn. Code \u00a7 55-8-187)\u201c\n\nThe Tennessee statute cited by the deputy says something is \u201cpatently offensive\u201d if it \u201cgoes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in describing or representing such matters.\u201d Those \u201cmatters\u201d are sexual in nature, which Volokh points out was at the heart of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the free speech case Cohen v California. As Volokh notes, even the Tennessee Attorney General\u2019s office issued an opinion a few years ago stating that the statute could not be used to target \u201cstickers that are in extremely poor taste but are not obscene\u201d. It\u2019s a matter of personal opinion as to whether or not you find Ennis\u2019 sticker to be in poor taste, but there\u2019s no way it\u2019s obscene.\n\nEnnis could just pay the $50 fine, scrape the sticker off of his truck, and be done with the issue, but he says he\u2019s going to be meeting with a lawyer this week and fighting the citation. He\u2019ll undoubtably pay more in legal fees than what he\u2019s facing in fines, but Ennis says there\u2019s a principle at stake.\n\n\u201cI feel like I was singled out and it\u2019s going against my first amendment right for freedom of speech,\u201d Ennis said.\n\nHe\u2019s not wrong about the attempt to chill speech, whether or not he was singled out for enforcement. I might not choose to put that window sticker on my ride, but that\u2019s a matter of personal taste, not an issue for government involvement. I hope Nicholas Ennis gets a good attorney, and this sheriff\u2019s office is reminded of the fact that speech we don\u2019t like, even speech we may find offensive, is still protected under our 1st Amendment.", "description": "A Tennessee man says he'll fight a citation for having an \"obscene\" sticker on his vehicle that involves two rifles and the letters \"u\" and \"c\".", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://bearingarms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sticker1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
