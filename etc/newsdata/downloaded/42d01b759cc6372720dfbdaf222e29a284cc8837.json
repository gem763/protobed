REUTERS/Tim McLaughlin/File Photo\n\nPannick, who counts Queen Elizabeth II and Saudi Arabia among his clients, is one of the lawyers who this week won a landmark case to overturn the British government\u2019s suspension of parliament in the weeks before the deadline to exit the EU.\n\n\u201cOver the past two years, my legal team has taken advice from David Pannick, a leading expert,\u201d the nephew, Li Shengwu, said in a Facebook post.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful for Lord Pannick\u2019s guidance and help, even as he has been in the midst of winning a landmark constitutional case in the UK.\u201d\n\nGary Oliver, a spokesman for Pannick at Blackstone Chambers, confirmed Pannick had been instructed by Li in an advisory capacity, without giving further details.\n\nSingapore\u2019s Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers (AGC) began proceedings against Li, an assistant professor at Harvard University, in 2017 over a private Facebook post in which Li said the Singapore government is \u201cvery litigious and has a pliant court system\u201d.\n\nIn a letter to Li nine days after he made the post, Senior State Counsel Francis Ng said the post was an \u201cegregious and baseless attack\u201d on the Singapore legal system. He asked Li to apologise and sign a declaration that he had made false allegations and was in contempt of the judiciary.\n\nLi did not concede and said that his private Facebook post was taken \u201ccompletely out of context\u201d and that any criticism he made was \u201cin good faith\u201d. If found guilty of contempt of court, Li could face fines or jail.\n\nThe case came amid a wider public feud among the children of the island\u2019s founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, which pitted Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong against his siblings Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Wei Ling. Lee Hsien Yang is Li\u2019s father.\n\nThe dispute initially centred on what to do with the state founder\u2019s house, but later entered the political arena with Lee Hsien Yang publicly backing a new opposition party.\n\nLee Hsien Loong has held power since 2004 and is widely expected to step down after elections set to take place within months.", "description": "The Singapore prime minister's nephew said on Wednesday he had hired top British lawyer David Pannick to advise him on a contempt of court case at the heart of a feud among members of the city-state's first family.", "authors": ["Fathin Ungku", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433745439&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O11X", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
