Experts say 9 million tons (8 million metric tons) of plastic waste, including plastic bottles, bags, toys and other items, flows annually into the ocean from beaches, rivers and creeks, endangering marine life in the oceans, including whales .\n\nThree of the machines have already been deployed to Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam \u2014 and a fourth is heading to the Dominican Republic, he said.\n\nIzham Hashim from the government of Selangor state in Malaysia was present at the launch and said he was happy with the machine.\n\n\u201cIt has been used for 1 1/2 months in the river and it\u2019s doing very well, collecting the plastic bottles and all the rubbish,\u201d he said.\n\nSlat said he believes 1,000 rivers are responsible for some 80% of plastic pouring into the world\u2019s oceans and he wants to tackle them all in the next five years.\n\n\u201cThis is not going to be easy, but imagine if we do get this done,\u201d he told his audience of enthusiastic supporters, who whooped, clapped and cheered his announcements. \u201cWe could truly make our oceans clean again.\u201d\n\nSlat used his live-streamed unveiling to appeal for support from countries committing to clean up their rivers and businesses prepared to inject funding and help with the operation of the devices.\n\nThe vessel is designed to be moored in rivers and has a shaped nose to deflect away larger floating debris like tree trunks. The interceptors work by guiding plastic waste into an opening in its bow, a conveyor belt then carries the trash into the guts of the machine where it is dropped into dumpsters. The interceptor sends a text message to local operators that can come and empty it when it\u2019s full.\n\nSlat showed off how it worked by dumping hundreds of yellow rubber ducks into the water at the launch event in Rotterdam\u2019s port. The interceptor caught nearly all of them.\n\nThe machines currently cost about 700,000 euros ($775,600), but Slat said the cost will likely drop as production increases.\n\nJan van Franeker of the Wageningen Marine Research institute has been critical of The Ocean Cleanup in the past, but said the new device looks promising.\n\n\u201cI am really happy they finally moved toward the source of the litter,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe design, from what I can see, looks pretty good.\u201d\n\nSlat argued that the economic impact of not picking plastic out of rivers is higher than the cost of buying and using the machines.\n\n\u201cDeploying interceptors is even cheaper than deploying nothing at all,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of climate issues at https://www.apnews.com/Climate", "description": "ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) \u2014 A young Dutch inventor is widening his effort to clean up floating plastic from the Pacific Ocean by moving into rivers,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/28/f64867_netherlands-ocean-cleanup-84406-young-dutch-inventor-boyan-slat-unveils-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
