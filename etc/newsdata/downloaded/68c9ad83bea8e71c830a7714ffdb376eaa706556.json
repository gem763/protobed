That includes work on his latest collection shown Saturday at New York Fashion Week.\n\n\u201cThis is my life, you know. I have a lot of people here who are very good to me that I employ. Am I going to start crying? I don\u2019t take that lightly. I want to do well for them,\u201d Maxwell said backstage after the show.\n\nThe 34-year-old Texan made his 2020 spring ready-to-wear collection about everything he loves.\n\n\u201cI wanted to show in Brooklyn, with food I like, drinks I like, music I like, people I like. Just have a good time,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd he did just that. Guests chowed down on Shake Shack burgers and fries waiting for the show to begin. He also served them an array of cocktails, vegan chocolate chip cookies and doughnuts from Cha Cha Matcha.\n\nLily Aldridge was among his front row guests.\n\nIrina Shayk opened the show with a twirl to catchy music that blasted throughout a Brooklyn warehouse. The supermodel wore a pair of green leather pants, a denim button-down blouse and an oversized beige leather blazer.\n\nBella Hadid, a regular on his runways, debuted Maxwell\u2019s denim collection. Her look was casual with a collared purple shirt under a deep purple sweater topped off by a lavender blazer and handbag.\n\nMaxwell is known for his impeccably tailored clothing, mostly red carpet-ready gowns, but he changed it up for this collection, also featuring men\u2019s suits, jeans and sweaters. It was his first turn at menswear.\n\n\u201cHonestly, the inspiration this time, I didn\u2019t start with a story. I started with the women around me. We didn\u2019t always use a fit model. It was just women in the office trying the clothes on. And they were like, I like it. I would wear it. So I am like, \u2018OK cool,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nAnd the menswear? That, Maxwell said, \u201cstarted with my fiance when I rolled over one night before bed he was like, \u2018I would love to have a shirt in the color of Bella Hadid\u2019s dress from last September.\u2019 And I said, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll make you one.\u2019 And I loved it, and I enjoyed it.\u201d\n\nThe final looks of the show featured contemporary takes on evening gowns. Shayk wore a body-hugging black gown with an open back and side cut-outs. Hadid was in an emerald green two-piece draped look with a high slit. Candice Swanepoel wore a silk skirt with hip cut- outs and a black bra top.\n\nMaxwell became emotional when talking about the high-profile models who appeared in his show.\n\n\u201cI knew Irina before, I think everyone that showed up, you know. It (New York Fashion Week) is a shorter, condensed schedule this time and the girls do really have to think about that schedule and I, again, don\u2019t take lightly the fact that they showed up for me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to. Am I going to start crying again?\u201d\n\nHe did.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Brandon Maxwell has had quite the year.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gina Abdy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/fashion_brandon_maxwell_35376_c0-154-3885-2419_s1770x1032.jpg?47e7a405dc2d1e6911ed2b834abf51cc2624bdbb", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
