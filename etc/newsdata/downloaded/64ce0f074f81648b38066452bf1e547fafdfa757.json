It\u2019s not hard to see why Fox executives may have wanted to bring him aboard. Solomon\u2019s work has underpinned the entire cascade of lies the White House and Trump in particular have pushed over the past few weeks.\n\nSolomon\u2019s writings\u2014including those most recently at The Hill, where he worked until last month\u2014are drenched in innuendo and mischaracterizations, all in service of attacking Trump\u2019s political opponents. Solomon is already a regular Fox News fixture. He appeared on Fox News\u2019s The Story show last week to claim that he was being victimized by \u201cMcCarthy-like\u201d attacks. As Mother Jones noted on Solomon\u2019s hiring\u2014which coincided with Giuliani claiming that the man deserves a Pulitzer\u2014Solomon\u2019s \u201calliance with pro-Trump forces\u201d is now \u201cofficial.\u201d\n\nFor many, Solomon remains far from a household name: a relatively obscure journalist who worked until recently at a relatively obscure outlet pushing relatively obscure stories about relatively obscure countries. But for those who\u2019ve followed his work (which includes a long-ago stint at Newsweek and The Daily Beast), his role in the entire unfolding national nightmare\u2014and the fact that he provided a willing platform to lies and half-truths coming out of Ukraine\u2014wasn\u2019t a surprise.", "description": "Journalism\u2019s leading conspiracy theorist has finally found his natural home.
