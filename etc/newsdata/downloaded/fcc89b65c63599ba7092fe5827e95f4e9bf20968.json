Craig McDonald, Reporter\n\nWESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2013 After breaking up 63 years ago in high school, Annette Callahan and Bob Harvey, now both 80, officially became man-and-wife in a ceremony held Saturday.\n\nTheir love story of rekindled romance has been likened to a Hallmark movie.\n\nThe tale of the widowers rediscovering their teenage love after mutual happy years spent married to others also has assumed viral proportions since it debuted in The Pataskala Standard in late September.\n\nThat story went on to appear in numerous newspapers across the country before countless other media began to spin their own versions. It\u2019s attracted attention from \"Access Hollywood\" and \"Inside Edition.\"\n\nIt even triggered an inquiry from an advertising agency wondering exactly what vehicle Harvey drove nearly 500 miles from Virginia to Ohio to reunite with his high school sweetheart for the first time in six decades. (For the record, his wheels were \u201ca 2018 ruby red Ford Flex.\u201d)\n\n'Like a Hallmark movie': High school sweethearts, now 80, will marry in October\n\nFor their nuptials, Callahan wore burgundy slacks and matching sweater.\n\nHarvey, in a nod to a famous 1957 song of the same name made famous by country crooner Marty Robbins, wore \u201ca white sport coat and a pink carnation.\u201d\n\nAnnette Callahan and Bob Harvey make their first official entrance as husband and wife at the Nutcracker restaurant after a private ceremony held Saturday, Oct. 19, 2019, in Westerville, Ohio.

(\u201cSomeone else will hold my dreams.\u201d)\n\nIn many respects, and for many decades, that song that has nothing near a happy ending threatened to remain Harvey's reality in regards to Callahan.\n\nFortunately, life doesn\u2019t have to imitate art. No spoiler here: In the end, they end up together, happily.\n\n\u2018I got a little emotional up there\u2019\n\nThe couple were wed in a historic chapel at Central College Presbyterian Church in Westerville \u2013 Callahan's church, with Pastor David Redding officiating.\n\nThe ceremony caps a love story that began in the fall of 1955 when the two met in high school during study hall. \u201cOver that time, I fell 100% in love\u2026 my soul mate,\" Harvey said shortly before the Saturday morning ceremony.\n\nBut on a long ago summer break, Callahan met another whom she would later wed. Harvey married too, shortly after graduating high school.\n\nSix decades later, both widowed, the two reunited and rekindled their love affair.\n\nAt several points on their wedding day, the two referenced their former spouses and the signs that they had blessed the new relationship. Harvey noted his daughter picked out his necktie for the big day, then he noticed it incorporated daisies in its pattern, his late-wife\u2019s favorite flower.\n\nThey also credit a higher power for their reunion. Harvey said, \"We both feel the Lord is instrumental in getting us back together.\"\n\nReferencing a Johnny Mathis song that has been a theme in their story, and their vows earlier that morning, Harvey then added, \"We pledged to love each other until 'The Twelfth of Never.' \"\n\nAfter the ceremony, Callahan confided, \u201cI got a little emotional up there. I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to make it.\u201d\n\n\u2018Giddy as can be\u2019\n\nFor their reception, the couple chose Nutcracker Family Restaurant in Pataskala, Ohio, whose d\u00e9cor and vibe lean hard on 1950's nostalgia, walls decorated with art from that era and many images of 1957 Chevy Bel Airs like those adorning one of Harvey's favorite shirts.\n\nThe Nutcracker is also where the couple had their first date in six decades.\n\nBob Harvey dressed in a white sport coat with a pink carnation, pulls the wedding rings out before marrying Annette Callahan on Saturday, Oct. 19, 2019, in Westerville, Ohio.

The Nutcracker also provided more wedding cake for the overflow diners in the main part of the restaurant.\n\nShortly after noon Saturday, the newlyweds entered the reception area at the Nutcracker to mutual favorite Mathis, played on a boombox.\n\nLaughing and kissing, they danced to \u201cChances Are,\" with friends and family looking on.\n\nHarvey said, \u201cI\u2019m giddy as can be\u2026 My heart is bursting. We\u2019re looking forward to a very long-lasting relationship.\u201d\n\nAnd their honeymoon? They plan a trip to Maumee Bay in Oregon, Ohio, as soon as rain isn\u2019t threatened there.\n\nThat said, Callahan noted that her new husband had joked that given the broad media attention attracted since their story first appeared, the bigger risk than rain might be drones trying to capture images of the happy couple.\n\nFollow Craig McDonald on Twitter: @CraigMMcDonald\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/22/high-school-sweethearts-marry-80/4060625002/", "description": "The couple broke up 63 years ago in high school, but were reunited and rekindled their love affair years after they were both widowed.", "authors": ["Craig Mcdonald", "Published A.M.
