The cause of death was multiple injuries. She was travelling south east at the time.'\n\nHe said the pheasant was found on the northbound carriage shortly after police arrived.\n\nMs Haywood's car hit a tree on the B1183 at Scrivelsby, near Horncastle in Lincolnshire, on January 22. Pictured, floral tributes left at the scene\n\nPC Brown added: 'It is more likely a pheasant or animal caused her to be distracted.\n\n'Some left-hand steering needed to be applied so it's a more obvious explanation of the collision.'\n\nHe added there was an unexplained mark on the bonnet which was not caused by the impact with the tree but was 'characteristic of an animal strike'.\n\nNatalie's mother Christine Haywood, who attended the inquest with friends and family, said: 'She was a very bubbly, outgoing person who always had a smile on her face - she loved her family.\n\n'She handed a 10,000 word essay for her university course, she was stressed about it all over Christmas - she was at Bishop Grossteste University in Lincoln studying childcare and was on her way back because the weather was closing in.'\n\nCoroner Paul Cooper said: 'It was a tragic road accident, it's nobody's fault.'", "description": "Natalie Haywood died when her Vauxhall Corsa hit a tree on the B1183 in Lincolnshire, on  January 22.
