As we see in the trailer that we just released, there\u2019s been a year, and there\u2019s been an inevitable maturation in that year.\n\nThe 34-year-old actor said the change is very \u2018linked to the future we\u2019re in\u2019, which will present \u2018an entirely brand-new tapestry of conflict.\u2019\n\nShe was also full of praise for the way the show writers have embraced change as \u2018a sort of cornerstone\u2019 for her role as Michael and ramped up \u2018that question of identity \u2026 to the nth degree\u2019.\n\nLike us, Sonequa will be missing Pike too this season (Picture: CBS)\n\nOn the question of who we\u2019d be seeing Michael interacting with on the new season, Sonequa said she will miss Pike, Tyler and Lorca who we lose in this jump to the future but \u2018this cast is stellar\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018That was one of the things I was most excited about when I found out we were going to be jumping to the future,\u2019 she said. \u2018As much as we will forever miss the people that have come before, and we will never forget them, and did not want them to leave. the fact is that we have to find who we are together in this new future that can\u2019t help but bind us together.\n\n\u2018And so that in itself creates a lot of opportunity for us to play off of each other and with each other as we discover the new world.\u2019\n\nShe revealed that we should be getting a bunch Burnham and Saru scenes and Tilly and Stamets will also spend a lot of time together. Plus David Ajala, who is brand new to the cast is getting a lot of love. But she said \u2018you will be seeing a lot of people interacting with each other that you haven\u2019t seen much of before.\u2019\n\nSonequa said she has a list of favourite Michael scenes but they are a heady mix of conversation and action, \u2018so it\u2019s hard to pinpoint\u2019.\n\nBut she did say that moments when the cast all comes together such as \u2018bridge days\u2019 are probably her favourite type of scene if she had to narrow it down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSonequa said that while the singing and dancing \u2018never stops\u2019 as to whether there will be any big songs this season she could only respond: \u2018we\u2019ll see\u2019.\n\nFor now trekkers will have to settle for rewatching the season three trailer, while they wait for Picard to be released in January next year.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
