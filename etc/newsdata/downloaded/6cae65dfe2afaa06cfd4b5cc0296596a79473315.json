Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) takes the stage before addressing attendees during an AFL-CIO presidential summit in Philadelphia on Tuesday. (Mark Makela/Reuters)\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) clashed sharply over health care in separate appearances before union members on Tuesday, intensifying one of the central policy disputes in the Democratic presidential race.\n\nSpeaking at a forum hosted by the Philadelphia Council of the AFL-CIO, Biden touted his plan to expand the Affordable Care Act with an optional public insurance program. Without naming Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), he eagerly criticized the competing proposal they have championed as injurious to organized labor.\n\n\u201cI have a significant health care plan. But guess what? Under mine, you can keep your health insurance you\u2019ve bargained for if you like it,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, you can move it, and you can buy into a public plan.\u201d\n\nSanders promoted his Medicare-for-all proposal, under which the government would be the sole insurer for all Americans. And he highlighted an ongoing labor dispute in which health care costs have been shifted onto the union backing striking workers.\n\nThe collision showed how heavily health care is factoring into the crucial fall stretch of the race, which polls show has at least temporarily become a three-way competition between Biden, Warren and Sanders.\n\nIn delivering their remarks before a union audience, Biden and Sanders took their cases directly to the working class voters expected to play a significant role in the nomination contest.\n\n\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden addresses attendees during an AFL-CIO presidential summit in Philadelphia on Tuesday. (Mark Makela/Reuters)\n\nThe former vice president told the crowd, \u201cYou\u2019ve broken your neck to get\u201d your health-care plans and \u201cyou\u2019ve given up wages to get it.\u201d He added, \u201cYou should be entitled to keep it. And no plan should take it away from you if that\u2019s what you decide.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s remarks came on the same day that a standoff between the United Auto Workers and General Motors escalated, with GM shifting health-care costs onto striking workers. Later, when Sanders spoke, he brought this up.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of ugliness and greed that we are seeing every day,\u201d Sanders said, prompting boos about GM\u2019s conduct from the crowd. Sanders, who recently changed how his Medicare-for-all plan would protect union workers \u2014 giving them more leverage amid concerns from some in organized labor about his plan \u2014 defended it as the best path to achieve complete coverage for Americans.\n\nAddressing reporters afterward, Sanders argued that under his plan, the situation with GM would be averted.\n\n\u201cHere you have the situation where the UAW is now on strike, 49,000 workers. I\u2019m sure that in that 49,000, there are family members who are seriously ill,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder Medicare-for-all, whether you\u2019re working, whether you\u2019re not working, whether you go from one job to another job, it\u2019s right there with you.\u201d\n\nSara Nelson, the influential president of the Association of Flight Attendants, an AFL-CIO union, appeared to warn Biden over his comments on Twitter. \u201cA note to anyone who wants to use union members as a wedge to oppose #MedicareForAll: @UAW has one of the best plans in the country, but management can still use it to hold workers hostage. #M4A puts power back in our hands,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSeveral of the unions represented at the forum also belonged to affiliates that have endorsed some form of single-payer health care. Blossom Kaleo, 41, a part-team teacher and member of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers, said that it was wrong to say that union members were afraid to replace their current coverage with a universal plan. The American Federation of Teachers has supported the Sanders bill.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even afford what our union offers,\u201d Kaleo said. \u201cI\u2019m for Medicare-for-all because it\u2019s a human right.\u201d\n\nWarren, who did not attend Tuesday\u2019s forum, strongly supports Medicare-for-all. \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie,\u201d she said at a June debate. Biden seized on her comment in last Thursday\u2019s debate.\n\n\u201cI know that the senator says she\u2019s for Bernie, well, I\u2019m for Barack,\u201d said Biden, who has frequently invoked the 44th president and his service as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president.\n\nConcluding his remarks at the end of a question-and-answer session Tuesday, Biden argued that it\u2019s not necessary to remove existing laws to make progress, emphasizing one of the core themes of his campaign.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do it by taking down and ripping away everything that\u2019s been in place before. That\u2019s not necessary,\u201d Biden said.\n\nThe Democratic candidates are making more explicit appeals to union workers than in past campaigns, as the focus on working class voters has sharpened in the party after President Trump in 2016 benefited from the support of many of them.\n\nDemocratic activists felt the party did not speak to union workers\u2019 economic and social concerns, especially in upper Midwestern states where Trump was victorious. Attempts to correct that have been evident in many of the platforms the candidates have embraced.\n\nBiden and Sanders, the only candidates who have won endorsements from national unions this year, have sought to portray themselves as champions of workers. Warren, who on Monday won the endorsement of the Working Families Party, also has underscored support for measures benefiting working class Americans.\n\nBut most large unions are in no rush to pick sides in the crowded and fluid race. For the moment, there does not appear to be a consensus candidate in the labor community. Four years ago was different, as organized groups largely lined up behind Hillary Clinton.\n\nFor Sanders, the appearance here marked his first campaign stop since Sunday. With a voice that was noticeably raspy at last Thursday\u2019s debate, Sanders canceled most of his Monday and Tuesday schedule to rest his vocal cords, his campaign said.\n\nHis voice still a bit hoarse as he spoke, Sanders received some of the loudest cheers of the day. But he also got some heckles from the back of the room.\n\nThe Vermont senator returned to the trail facing some new challenges and turmoil. Warren\u2019s Working Families Party endorsement was a blow to Sanders, who won the group\u2019s support in the 2016 campaign.\n\nSanders also shook up his campaign in New Hampshire, a state where he defeated Clinton by a wide margin in 2016 but faces a more competitive race this time. His campaign replaced its New Hampshire state director, Joe Caiazzo, with Shannon Jackson, who managed Sanders\u2019s 2018 Senate reelection effort. The campaign announced the move to supporters on Sunday.\n\nTuesday\u2019s event was the first presidential summit hosted by the Philadelphia Council AFL-CIO, which includes over 100 local unions that represent nearly 200,000 workers. In addition to Biden and Sanders, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and billionaire activist Tom Steyer also fielded questions here.\n\nThe AFL-CIO, an influential coalition of 55 national and international unions representing 12.5 million workers, is taking time before deciding whether to endorse a candidate. It has scheduled a candidate forum for next spring, after which it might pick a favorite, according to a spokesman.\n\nAn endorsement by the general board of the AFL-CIO will require a two-thirds vote of membership, according to the spokesman. The group endorsed Clinton in June 2016.\n\nBoth Biden and Sanders sought to make a personal pitch to union members in the crowd. Biden talked about growing up in a working class community in which many of the people around him went on to become union workers. Sanders told the audience he came from a \u201cworking class family who lived paycheck to paycheck.\u201d\n\nIn his turn onstage, Sanders also took aim at opponents such as Biden who voted for the Iraq War and sweeping trade deals.\n\n\u201cNot only did I vote against NAFTA and [permanent trade relations] with China, I helped lead the opposition to them. Joe voted for both of those agreements,\u201d Sanders told reporters afterward. \u201cI did not vote to bail out the crooks on Wall Street. Joe did.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Biden sought to cast his long career in government and politics \u2014 something critics seeking younger leadership have pounced on \u2014 into a positive.\n\n\u201cThe bad news is I\u2019ve been around a long time. The good news is I\u2019ve been around a long time. You all know me,\u201d he said.", "description": "The former vice president and the Vermont senator clashed in separate appearances before Philadelphia AFL-CIO members, repeating their debate disagreement.", "authors": ["Sean Sullivan", "Reporter Covering National Politics", "David Weigel", "National Reporter Covering Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qSpvW69kfJh4EPBs3XPdjPzApyU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WEX3MMGZUAI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
