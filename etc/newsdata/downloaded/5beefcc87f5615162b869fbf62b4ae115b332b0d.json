I\u2019m on my favourite Show. See you this week on @the_queen_mzansi. Hope you like her,\" she wrote.\n\nSpeaking to DRUM, the 29-year-old actress didn\u2019t want to reveal too much about her character but did tell us Khumbuzile is a hidden love child who\u2019s just trying to have a relationship with her father.\n\n\n\n\"Khumbuzile is someone\u2019s love child, no one knows about her because she\u2019s the only child who was hidden by her father. She\u2019s basically all about family and she\u2019s trying to get to know her siblings as well,\" she says.\n\nLike all actors, Omuhle had to audition for the role, and the process never gets easier.\n\nREAD MORE: SK Khoza to leave 'The Queen'\n\n\"I still get super nervous when I have to audition for a role, this wasn\u2019t different at all. I initially auditioned for a different role, but I didn\u2019t get it because I look a bit too young for it. So, I was called for this one instead, and I\u2019m so grateful for how everything turned out. They took months to give me a response after my audition, so I thought I didn\u2019t get it,\" she laughs.\n\nShe loves every character she plays because they all challenge her and bring out something new in her, but the one thing she admires about Khumbuzile is how independent she is.\n\n\"She\u2019s such an independent young lady, she\u2019s studying for her honours and is just very self-sufficient, I love that!\"\n\nAre there any similarities between Omuhle and Khumbuzile?\n\n\"Yes, quite a few. But mostly how feisty we both are, apparently,\" she chuckles. \"And she\u2019s very strong, I see a bit of myself in her.\"\n\nThe three things Omuhle thinks the audience will love about Khumbuzile are: \"Firstly, she\u2019s very stylish, very swaggy young woman, they\u2019ll love that. Also, she\u2019s got a bit of an attitude, she brings some spice, and she brags a whole lot,\" Omuhle laughs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Local actress and model, Omuhle Gela is the newest face to join Mzansi Magic\u2019s The Queen and according to her, viewers are going to love her role.", "authors": ["Nkosazana Ngwadla"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7901/3fd7464876624574a1db45e6ca62a851.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
