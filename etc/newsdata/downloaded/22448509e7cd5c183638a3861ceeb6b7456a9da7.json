Home Entertainment, not rated, 1.33:1 aspect ratio, 908 minutes, $89.99) \u2014 The definitive animated chronicle of the Mystery Inc. gang\u2019s early years arrives in a mini haunted house containing Blu-ray discs and some fan-loving memorabilia.\n\nThe 4-disc collection compiles high-definition versions of all 41 episodes of Hanna-Barbera\u2019s original series that ran on CBS during its Saturday morning line-up from 1969 to 1978 in various iterations.\n\nThe episodes include the first two season of the show and a third season cobbled together from \u201cThe Scooby-Doo Show\u201d and \u201cScooby\u2019s All-Stars.\u201d\n\nAll told, the first 25 episodes will gush with nostalgia for fans as they learn about the crime- and paranormal-solving adventures of Shaggy Rogers, Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley and canine extraordinaire Scooby-Doo and their run-ins with wily villains such as the Black Knight, Miner Forty-Niner, Ape Man, Puppet Master, Redbeard\u2019s ghost and the Mummy of Anka.\n\nDespite sometimes looking almost too sharp in the Blu-ray format, as some of the animation short cuts and budget deficiencies are exposed, this is still a welcomed release of a pop culture institution.\n\nFrightening extras: Warner Bros. delivers the goods for Scooby fans leading with a bunch of featurettes.\n\nThe extras include a 17-minute tribute to award-winning voice actor Frank Welker who has brought Fred Jones and Scooby to aural life over the years; 7 minutes on various iterations of the Scooby Doo shows and movies; and 9 minutes on Scooby merchandising over the years.\n\nAnother roughly 80 minutes of vintage segments cover Scooby\u2019s early years and a look at the partnership of William Hanna and Joe Barbera.\n\nNext, pull off the roof from the embossed scary mansion (the overall size of a thick dictionary) to find a full-color, 32-page condensed version of the \u201cScooby-Doo Encyclopedia\u201d; and a keychain with a small pocket-sized Scooby vinyl figure attached (a young version of the pooch eating a sandwich) from Funko\u2019s Pocket Pop! Line.\n\nThe Haunting of Hill House: Extended Director\u2019s Cut (Paramount Pictures Home Entertainment, Rated TV-MA, 2.00:1 aspect ratio, 569 minutes, $49.99) \u2014 Director and co-writer Mike Flanagan\u2019s reimagined version of Shirley Jackson\u2019s 1959 gothic horror novel exploring the future repercussions of a family that lived in a haunted mansion in the 1990s debuts in the high-definition format.\n\nFlashbacks battle with the present to constantly flesh out the plight of parents Hugh (Henry Thomas / Timothy Hutton) and Olivia Crane (Carla Gugino) and their children Steven (Paxton Singleton / Michiel Huisman), Shirley (Lulu Wilson / Elizabeth Reaser), Luke (Julian Hilliard / Oliver Jackson-Cohen), Theo (Mckenna Grace / Kate Siegel), and Nell (Violet McGraw / Victoria Pedretti) as they suffer a terrible tragedy at the mansion multiple times and must learn to cope with it for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe supernatural horror arrives via chilling scenes in the massive, ultra-creepy mansion as apparitions such as the bent-neck lady reach out to the family and trigger the occasional jump scare with audiences over the 10-episode story.\n\nHowever, the present character predicaments play out like watching an emotionally draining Broadway play with plenty of secrets waiting for family members to uncover.\n\nAfter watching the psychological carnage play out, I\u2019ll remind parents again that living in an aggressively haunted house with young children for any amount of time will lead to exorbitant psychiatry bills.\n\nFrightful extras: Fans get extended episodes \u201cSteven See a Ghost,\u201d \u201cThe Bent-Neck Lady\u201d and \u201cSilence Lay Steadily\u201d with a welcomed optional commentary track from Mr. Flanagan on each as well as his thoughts on the episode \u201cTwo Storms.\u201d\n\nDoom Patrol: The Complete First Season (Warner Bros Home Entertainment, Rated TV-MA, 2.20:1 aspect ratio, 775 minutes, $29.98) \u2014 DC Comics\u2019 bizarre sequential art series was adapted into a live-action streaming show earlier this year and now arrives via a trio of Blu-ray discs containing all 15 episodes of the inaugural season.\n\nSure to please fans of monsters, insane Nazi science and the supernatural, the show mixes and embellishes plotlines from the 1960s Doom Patrol comics as well as writer Grant Morrison\u2019s twisted take on the superhero team from the late 1980s.\n\nFocusing on a group of angst-ridden misfits living in a mansion, the series introduces viewers to:\n\n\u2022 Former actress Rita Farr (April Bowlby), exposed to chemicals during an on the set accident, she now struggles to keep from turning into a blob of disfigurement.\n\n\u2022 Negative Man (Matt Bomer), a former experimental aircraft pilot nearly burned alive in a crash and now tethered to a cosmic energy entity.\n\n\u2022 Former NASCAR driver Cliff Steele aka Robotman (Brendan Fraser), killed in a car accident and only his brain survives in a metallic shell.\n\n\u2022 \u201cCrazy\u201d Jane (Diane Guerrero), loaded with 64 personalities and wild powers that go with each of them.\n\n\u2022 Vic Stone (Joivan Wade), a technology-enhanced hero who eventually joins Teen Titans and the Justice League.\n\nThe mixed bag of reticent heroes are led by the wheelchair-bound Dr. Niles Caulder aka \u201cChief\u201d (Timothy Dalton) who goes missing and sets the team into action.\n\nThe first season finds them encountering even stranger villains such as dimensionally dismembered archenemy Mr. Nobody\u201d (Alan Tudyk); Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man (a guy with a second dinosaur head); the Beard Hunter (he tracks human targets by eating their facial hair); and a revenge-seeking mouse named Admiral Whiskers.\n\nYes, this is a real Halloween party that never ends.\n\nFrightening extras: Viewers get 8 minutes of deleted scenes, a gag reel and no explanation for the onscreen insanity.\n\nStephen King\u2019s The Stand (Paramount Home Entertainment, not rated, 1.33:1 aspect ratio, 359 minutes, $31.97) \u2014 The 1994 ABC miniseries that attempted to adapt the famed horror author\u2019s book about the ultimate battle between good versus evil arrives on a single Blu-ray disc for its 25th anniversary containing the four-episode epic.\n\nPacked with some of the memorable and upcoming stars of film and TV, the story covers a flu-like plague accidently spread by a U.S. government research facility guard that wipes out nearly all of the earth\u2019s population in two weeks.\n\nThe immune survivors band together and are drawn to either one of two camps plodded by mysterious dreams. They either align with the good led by the elderly Mother Abagail Freemantle (Ruby Dee) or the bad aligned with the demonic Randall Flagg (Jamey Sheridan).\n\nActing power included Gary Sinise (\u201cForest Gump\u201d), Molly Ringwald (\u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d), Rob Lowe (\u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire\u201d), Laura San Giacomo (\u201cJust Shoot Me\u201d), the late Ray Walston (\u201cFast Times at Ridgemont High\u201d), Matt Frewer (\u201cMax Headroom\u201d), Adam Storke (\u201cMystic Pizza\u201d), Bill Fagerbakke (\u201cCoach\u201d), the late Miguel Ferrer (\u201cRobocop\u201d), the late Ossie Davis (\u201cTouched by an Angel\u201d) and, believe it or not, basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nI\u2019ll admit that some of subplots and character development roll out like molasses in the roughly 6-hour series that could have easily been trimmed by 120 minutes or so.\n\nHowever, hardcore fans of the book will admire director Mick Garris\u2019 expensive production, with the screenplay actually written by Mr. King no less, and will savor every moment.\n\nI\u2019m also stunned how great the old shows look in high definition thanks to CBS Home Entrainment\u2019s meticulous restoration.\n\nSure the episodes are presented in the original 4x3 format with large black bars on either side of the screen, but the crisp details and colors really pop in locations such as Nebraska, New York City and Las Vegas using current Blu-ray players.\n\nFrightening extras: Throughout the series, views can turn on an optional commentary track featuring Mr. King and Mr. Garris with occasional additions from Mr. Lowe, Mr. Sheridan and Ferrer.\n\nIt\u2019s not a nonstop conversation, with long chunks of screen time with no commentary, but hearing the author discuss and dissect his work make it worth the gaps.\n\nViewers also get a vintage 5-minute promotional featurette not worth much except for its nostalgia.\n\nAmerican Horror Story: Apocalypse (20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, not rated, 1.78:1 aspect ratio, $29.98) \u2014 The eighth season of FX channel\u2019s outrageously ghoulish anthology series delivered one of its best storylines ever in a character-packed, clever tribute to its themes from previous seasons.\n\nRevealed through the standard 10-epsiode run are the events leading up to and the aftermath of a nuclear apocalypse in which the world\u2019s elite humans survive in secure underground bunkers created by the mysterious Cooperative.\n\nI\u2019ll not disclose all of the nuances of the season packed into a 3-disc DVD set but viewers will find the appearance of familiar witches, new warlocks, the debut of the anti-Christ and even a return to the Hotel Cortez and Horror House an irresistible story, especially during the Halloween season.\n\nThe ensemble cast includes Sarah Paulson as Cooperative minion Wilhemina Venable and favorite witch Cordelia Goode, Kathy Bates as Venable\u2019s assistant Miriam Mead, Cody Fern as too-powerful Warlock Michael Langdon, Billie Lourd as powerful witch Mallory, Jessica Lange as Langdon\u2019s grandmother Constance Langdon and even an appearance by the famed \u201cGold Dust Woman\u201d Stevie Nicks as her witchy self.\n\nAs always, the series pulls zero punches when exposing viewers to brutal violence and sexual themes, so be forewarned.\n\nFrightening extras: This bare-to-the-bones set shocks most by not offering any extras. Adding to that is daring to release the series in the antiquated, subpar resolution DVD format. Considering the creative effort put forth to deliver this award-winning series, it\u2019s ashame that fans of the show can\u2019t appreciate its visual horror in at least high definition.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
