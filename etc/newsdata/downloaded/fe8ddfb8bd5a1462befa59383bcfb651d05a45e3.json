But in a statement Thursday it said that it\u2019s aware of the reports about \u201cSmart Summon\u201d and is in contact with the company.\n\n\u201cThe agency will not hesitate to act if it finds evidence of a safety-related defect,\u201d NHTSA said in a statement.\n\nLast week, Tesla sent out an over-the-internet software update that lets some customers allow their car to navigate through a parking lot with no one at the wheel. The feature can only be used if a driver can see their vehicle, the company\u2019s website says.\n\nBut after the update, videos and pictures surfaced on social media about problems. Also, a promotional video on Tesla\u2019s website shows a car without a driver going the wrong way in a parking lot.\n\nOne owner said his car ran into the side of his garage while \u201cSmart Summon\u201d was working, while another showed his car narrowly missing a crash with crossing traffic. Another said his car was about to hit a golf cart before he was able to stop it.\n\nTesla\u2019s website cautions that drivers who use \u201cSmart Summon\u201d are responsible for the car and must monitor it at all times. The cars can be stopped remotely.\n\nMessages were left Thursday seeking comment from the company, which is based in Palo Alto, California.\n\nNHTSA\u2019s statement encouraged drivers to report vehicle issues to its online questionnaire system at https://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/VehicleComplaint/ .\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The U.S. government\u2019s highway safety agency is gathering information on reports of malfunctions with a Tesla feature that lets drivers summon their cars in parking lots.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/tesla-government_inquiry_87176_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e"}
