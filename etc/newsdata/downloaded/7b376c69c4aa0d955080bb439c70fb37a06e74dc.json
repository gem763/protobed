Iran has denied involvement in the strikes. crude oil futures were flat at $64.55 a barrel by 0732 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 15 cents, or 0.1%, to $59.19 a barrel, after sinking 5.7% on Tuesday.\n\n\"Considering limited spare (production) capacity outside Saudi Arabia and risks of renewed attacks on Saudi energy infrastructure, a risk premium is likely to stay on oil prices in the foreseeable future,\" UBS analysts said in a note.\n\nEnergy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said on Tuesday that average oil production in September and October would be 9.89 million barrels per day and that the world's top oil exporter would ensure full oil supply commitments to its customers this month.
