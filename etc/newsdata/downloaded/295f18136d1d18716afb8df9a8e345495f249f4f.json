Elliott returned to the track, eventually falling more than 50 laps behind the leader and finished 36th out of the 38 drivers in the field.\n\nWith 139 laps left to go in the race, Busch was involved in a multi-car wreck that included Aric Almirola, Ryan Preece, Kyle Larson and Jimmie Johnson.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBusch and his Toyota Camry were turned around coming out of Turn 4 after contact with Almirola\u2019s Ford Mustang and suffered damage to his left front that caused Busch to pit twice for repairs and in hopes he could remain on the lead lap while under the yellow caution flag.\n\nLarson suffered minor damage but was able to continue on. Neither Preece nor Johnson could stop in time and got into Almirola, causing extensive damage to the No. 10.\n\nJohnson finished last, while Almirola was one spot higher in 37th.\n\n\u201cHe chopped me getting into three,\u201d Almirola said of Busch to NBCSN. \u201cI tried to squeeze in front of him in the spring (race) on one of the restarts and he about wrecked me in turn 3. It was returned to him and he didn\u2019t like it and he ran me up over the curb and we got hooked together and ruined our day.\u201d\n\nAlmirola gave a veiled warning to Busch in the remainder of the playoffs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m frustrated,\u201d Almirola said. \u201cWe have 3 more weeks and I\u2019m going to make it hell for him.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n#NASCAR \u2026 Aric Almirola, after describing the incident with Kyle Busch, tells NBCSN: \"We have 3 more weeks and I'm going to make it hell for him.\" \u2014 Dustin Long (@dustinlong) October 27, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nElliott is now in a very difficult position with two races remaining to make it to Miami.\n\nFollow @JerryBonkowski", "description": "Two of the Round of 8 drivers have been involved in incidents at Martinsville.", "authors": ["Jerry Bonkowski"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/U3h9X.ZlR09UEPlAVKfkYQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTIuNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LGqrai7uQS9iVNVki7ap9A--~B/aD02ODI7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/5a16fb40d9f8b1cbdf10fd6647961c26", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
