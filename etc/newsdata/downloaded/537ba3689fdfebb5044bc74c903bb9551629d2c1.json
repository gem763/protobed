The diplomat argued the lockdown, imposed by Indian authorities, has exacerbated women\u2019s \u201cpain and suffering.\u201d\n\nTo prove her point, she referred to the recent front page photograph from the New York Times depicting a woman who lost her 22-year-old son after he had been bitten by a snake because she couldn\u2019t find an antidote in time to save him. \u201cAll actors of the United Nations system must address this dire and unacceptable situation,\u201d she said.\n\nIndia\u2019s Paulomi Tripathi, the first secretary of the country\u2019s mission to the UN, was quick to hit back. She avoided directly naming Pakistan, saying instead \u201cone delegation has callously chosen to politicize this agenda by making unwarranted references to internal matters of my country.\u201d\n\nTripathi then continued: \u201cAs they covet territory of others, they camouflage their vile intentions with fake concerns.\u201d\n\nShe took a final swipe at Pakistan, saying it is \u201cironic\u201d that a nation, where \u201cviolations of women\u2019s right to life in the name of \u2018honour\u2019 go unpunished,\u201d is making \u201cbaseless\u201d statements about her country.\n\nThe Indian government revoked Kashmir\u2019s autonomy in August and heightened security measures in the area, insisting it would help curb terrorism and lead to more economic development. The change, however, severely angered Pakistan, which claims the whole of Kashmir as its territory and says New Delhi has no right to unilaterally alter its status.\n\nLike this story?
