Mine looks like your before photo. On my list to do this week.\"\n\nAnother wrote: \"I want to also do this, I was thinking toothbrush too!\"\n\nUntil they make a washing machine for our washing machines, it looks like we'll be doing this.", "description": "A member of a Mrs Hinch Facebook group posted incredible before and after pictures of the cleaning job", "authors": ["James Rodger", "Luke Matthews", "Image", "Kentlive", "Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20664265.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mrs-Hinch-fan-shares-miracle-\u00a34-washing-machine-cleaning-trick-and-people-cant-believe-itMrs-Hinch.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
