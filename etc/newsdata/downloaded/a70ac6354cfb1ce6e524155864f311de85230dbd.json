When this occurs, it is called Leptomeningeal Disease and has a prognosis of two-three months. Your heart stops, you can\u2019t hear, your breath becomes shallow.\n\n\u2018How were we supposed to tell our daughters? How were we supposed to plan our future?\n\nAshlee, 16, dancing with her dad (Picture: Shalonda Chaddock / Chubby Cheek Photography)\n\nVideo of the dances will be kept tucked away until the sisters\u2019 wedding days (Picture: Shalonda Chaddock / Chubby Cheek Photography)\n\n\u2018Jason has always been the most attentive father. He\u2019s never missed any of their events. We have raised two daddy\u2019s girls and I was about to break their hearts. Their future suddenly looked very different.\n\n\u2018The dreams they had of their daddy walking them down the aisle had come to a screeching halt. The certain songs they\u2019ve played hundreds of times while imagining themselves swirling around a dance floor, in the perfect dress, in the arms of the first man they ever loved, suddenly took on new meaning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018In a quiet voice, holding back tears, they asked if they could have \u201ctheir\u201d dance. Yes, YES! You will have your dance! We create memories, we recreate them, why not PRE-create a moment?\u2019\n\nThe family\u2019s friends all stepped up to make sure the moment could happen. Some offered up wedding dresses while others did the girls\u2019 hair and makeup.\n\nThe end result was something special.\n\nBut the family are sharing photos now to raise awareness of glioblastoma (Picture: Shalonda Chaddock / Chubby Cheek Photography)\n\nMum Nicole posted a powerful status about her husband and daughters on Facebook (Picture: Shalonda Chaddock / Chubby Cheek Photography)\n\n\u2018There was laughter and tears but in the end, there was an everlasting memory,\u2019 wrote Nicole (Picture: Shalonda Chaddock / Chubby Cheek Photography)\n\n\u2018The day of the dance, the sun was shining through gray rain clouds, sunlight mixing with rain showers,\u2019 wrote Nicole. \u2018I realized, afterwards, how appropriate the weather was for this day. That is what we\u2019ve been doing through this whole journey, trying to find the light among the darkness, the sunshine in the rain.\n\n\u2018There was laughter and tears but in the end, there was an everlasting memory. There\u2019s a quote I love \u201cLife is not about waiting for the storm to pass, it\u2019s learning to dance in the rain.\u201d Our girls and their daddy did just that.\u2019\n\nAlongside the photos, the family also took video of the dances which will be kept tucked away until Ashlee and Kaylee\u2019s wedding days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey\u2019re sharing their story to raise awareness of glioblastoma and encourage people to live in the moment and love hard.\n\n\u2018I want them to remember not a journey of death, but a journey of life\u2019 (Picture: Shalonda Chaddock / Chubby Cheek Photography)\n\n\u2018When our girls look back at this chapter, I want them to remember not a journey of death, but a journey of life,\u2019 said Nicole. \u2018Take the trip, snap the pictures, eat dessert first, go see your friends, play games with your kids, make your days matter!\n\n\u2018When you live your life surrounded by kindness and love, you have lived your life well.\u2019\n\nNicole and her daughters plan on getting matching sound wave tattoos of Jason saying: \u2018I love you girls\u2019. The dad is also working on making recordings for them to listen to and writing letters they can open on important days of their lives.\n\nThe family is raising money through GoFundMe to cover Jason\u2019s medical costs and have a Facebook page where they share updates on his condition.\n\nMORE: Woman finally becomes a mum after late dad secretly left her \u00a315,000 for a fourth IVF attempt\n\nMORE: Every table at this couple\u2019s wedding reception had a different Disney theme\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "When Jason Halbert was diagnosed with a rare brain cancer and given months left to live, his daughters wanted to make time for their first dance.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_93360847_1572357781.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
