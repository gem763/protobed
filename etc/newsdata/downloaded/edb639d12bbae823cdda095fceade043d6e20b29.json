Often it\u2019s common for Media\u2019s and self-proclaimed pundits to judge the overall trend of Indian Stock Market just by looking at Nifty 50 Index. However, to take a well-informed trading decision it\u2019s not a good Idea to just rely on Nifty 50! Here\u2019s why, Take a look at this chart\n\nNifty 50 Making Higher Highs\n\nNifty 50 is not a good Measure of Stock Market\n\nSince the Beginning to 2018, Nifty 50 is making higher highs. From an Observer standpoint, this will give a rosy picture about the performance of Indian Stock Market. After looking at this chart, some of you may think that Market is in upward direction and everything is going well. Even one my fellow trader who\u2019s quite experienced, said that \u201cstock market was doing fine\u201d, referring to the price action of Nifty 50.\n\nAfter all, If Top 50 companies are doing well then everything is going good right? Don\u2019t jump to conclusions! Wait, until you see the other two charts!\n\nNifty Midcap Index\n\nNifty Midcap 100, The Index composed of Top 100 Midcap companies in NSE, lost almost 25% since the beginning of 2018. You might think that, it\u2019s not necessary to consider Midcap stocks for assessing the general market direction. Well, remember this fact \u2013 Midcap stocks are the backbone of a growing economy. Without a recovery in Midcaps you can\u2019t expect a broader recovery in Stock prices.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not fair to take a negative perspective only by looking at Midcap Index. But unfortunately, it\u2019s not just the Midcaps that\u2019re performing poorly\u2026\n\nNifty Smallcap Index\n\nSmallcap companies also experienced big turmoil, Take a look at Nifty Smallcap 100 Index. The Index lost around 40% since the beginning of 2018 and so far only a few small cap companies are doing better. It\u2019s easy to neglect by saying Smallcaps are highly volatile and not a good measure of overall Stock Market activity, but it\u2019s exactly the other way around!\n\nPerformance of Smallcap stocks gives a better picture of the overall Stock market activity and Economic growth, because they\u2019re the ones that benefit most from the Economic boom and get highly affected in the Economic downturns. So without considering Smallcaps, we can\u2019t get a clear picture of the stock market trend.\n\nFrom these scenarios, you might have understood why it\u2019s important to keep an eye on both Midcap and Smallcap stocks. Also you can see how easy it\u2019s to misjudge the market trend, just by looking at Nifty 50.\n\nSo is there another way to gauge the overall Market trend? Without missing the relevancy of Midcap and Smallcap stocks? Yep! There\u2019s an alternative way\u2026\n\nNifty 500 \u2013 A Better Alternative to track the Indian Stock Market\n\nNifty 500 is a better alternative\n\nWhile looking at Nifty 50 might give us a rosy picture, at the same time looking at Nifty Midcap and Smallcap Index will give us a bleak view of the overall Market activity. To get a better gauge and track the overall market trend, Nifty 500 will be a more realistic Index.\n\nAs you can see in the Nifty 500 chart, since the beginning of 2018, Indian Stock Market never made any significant moves. The overall Stock Market is almost flat, till to date.\n\nWhy Nifty 500 is a Better way of looking at Indian Stock Market?Nifty 500 is a better way to track the sentiment and trend of Indian Stock Market, since it takes all the major Largecap, Midcap and Smallcap stocks as composure. Hence it provides a more accurate and realistic picture of the overall Stock Market.\n\nIn my trading analysis, I always justify the Market Trend by looking at 500. Only Based on that I look for High Probability Price Action setups. Doing so gives a better edge in my trading.
