Most harmful is the loss of confidence,\" Ms Georgieva said.\n\n'Bigger loser'\n\nThe White House has said the tariffs are meant to force China to change its policies and dismissed concerns about growth, arguing that any harm to the US pales in comparison to the damage on China.\n\n\"That is not a good excuse if you can say, you know what, I'm a loser, but you're a bigger loser than me,\" Ms Georgieva said.\n\n\"I don't think that this is what people expect from leadership.\"", "description": "Brexit will add to world economic woes, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/587F/production/_109155622_gettyimages-1174493488.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
