Lengthy blackouts of both CBS and Nexstar stations also led to less revenue leaving the stock down almost 1.5% on Friday.\n\nThe AT&T boss was speaking at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Media, Communications and Entertainment Conference on Wednesday, There he explained the decisions to go dark on DirecTV, U-verse and other providers according to BroadcastingCable.com.\n\n\u201cWe had to make some tough decisions on those retrans providers, when some of the requests for increases were just not economically sound,\" Stephens said. \"And we decided that we would not accept them and then we had to hold our ground.\u201d\n\nHe added that the networks returned after \u201crates got to a reasonable level.\u201d\n\nAT&T needs to improve its customer relationship management, or CRM, if it's going to succeed with its two-revenue model of wireless subscriptions, which includes satellite television, and advertising, Porter Bibb, a media expert at MediaTech Capital Partners, said.\n\n\u201cNot reimbursing subscribers for the loss of CBS content is not helpful and the re-acquisition costs will be significant,\" Bibb said. \"Netflix has mastered CRM and provides an appropriate model for AT&T and all others entering the streaming wars.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, activist investors from the Elliott Group also took a large, $3.2 billion dollar slice of AT&T shares while submitting a letter with recommendations to maximize shareholder value. The letter slammed management and company strategies.\n\nStephens defended the company against Elliott\u2019s criticism.\n\n\u201cManagement and the board feels strongly that our current strategies are the best way to create value for our shareholders,\u201d he said.\n\nBibb said the maverick investment firm should be focusing on other wireless providers, like Verizon.\n\n\u201cElliott Management is dead wrong in criticizing AT&T for acquiring TimeWarner, and should focus on Verizon, which has no center or second revenue stream and consists only of dumb pipes, which will become less and less profitable as new competitors like T-Mobile/Sprint begin to take Verizon wireless subscribers,\u201d he said.\n\nStephens also was quick to point out that that despite the lost subscribers, the media company is surpassing earnings goals and is expected to meet or surpass commitments.\n\nElliott also recommended that AT&T divest in DirecTV which was bleeding prior to blackouts. The obvious buyer for the satellite TV company would be Dish, which the government would not allow to happen.\n\n\u201cWe understand the industrial logic, but quite frankly it\u2019s been tried and has been rejected,\u201d he said.\n\nMore likely would be AT&T liquidating some of the regional sports networks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to look at the RSNs,\u201d he said. \u201cRegional sports services have garnered good value in other transactions.\u201d\n\nWalt Disney Co. also took some swings at AT&T this week warning subscribers of more possible blackouts with ABC and ESPN channels.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nStephens would not discuss AT&T\u2019s HBO Max Streaming service, details of which WarnerMedia will present on Oct. 29 in Los Angeles. Instead, he spoke about Apple\u2019s announcement this week that company's streaming service, Apple TV+, which will be available for about $5 a month on Nov 10.\n\n\u201cI'll leave others to evaluate what you heard yesterday from Apple. But for me it reinforces \u2014 boy \u2014 we've got really quality assets and really quality capabilities that others just don't have \u2014 don't have at their disposal,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cThe first thing to remember is, we also start with something called HBO. And so, we only have a 40-year head start with a quality product that is the premium of premium. So, we feel really good about that,\u201d Stephens said.\n\nRelated Articles", "description": "AT&T stocks dive after CFO discusses blackouts.", "authors": ["Mike Cherico"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
