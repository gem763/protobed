I mean I didn\u2019t tell her that. I didn\u2019t let her know I was a stalker until after we had the kids.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing he didn\u2019t, otherwise there would have been a chance of Lisa running for the hills.\n\nJason married the Cosby Show actress in 2017 and they had been together for 12 years before then.\n\nThey share Lola, 12, and Wolf, 10, and are honestly the perfect family.\n\nThe Khal Drogo star thinks his marriage to Lisa \u2013 who also has daughter Zoe Kravitz with musician Lenny Kravitz \u2013 is proof that \u2018anything\u2019 can happen, no matter how unlikely the odds.\n\nHas anyone ever seen exes get on with current partners like this? (Picture: Alexandra Wyman/WireImage)\n\nJason and Lisa have been married for two years (Picture: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic)\n\nThe odds are usually in your favour when you look like, sound like, and are Jason Momoa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If someone says something isn\u2019t possible. I\u2019m like, \u201cListen here, I married Lisa Bonet. Anything is effing possible.\u201d\u2019\n\nGet you a man that talks about you the way Jason talks about Lisa.\n\nMeanwhile, our Khal will soon be reunited the Khaleesi Emilia Clarke on The Graham Norton Show soon.\n\nOn 25 October, the Game Of Thrones pals will be promoting their latest projects while we get to witness a beautiful reunion.\n\nDaenerys Targaryen will finally see her moon and her stars (Picture: HBO)\n\nJason will star in the futuristic TV series See, while Emilia is already creating a buzz with her festive film Last Christmas.\n\nEmilia is best known for playing Daenerys Targaryen on GoT, the onetime lover of Jason\u2019s character Khal Drogo.\n\nIn season one Daenerys and Drogo fell madly in love, but it was cut brutally short when a festering arrow wound caused Drogo to fall into a coma (which we still haven\u2019t gotten over, by the way).\n\nThe actors have remained good friends despite only being in one season together, so it will be a treat to see them share a screen once again \u2013 as themselves this time.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
