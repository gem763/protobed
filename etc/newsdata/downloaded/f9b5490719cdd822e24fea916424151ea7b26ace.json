He has been linked with a coaching role at French club Montpellier.\n\nRugby Australia director of rugby, Scott Johnson, has already been scoping possible candidates for 2020. New Zealander Dave Rennie has emerged as a clear favourite because of his success with the Chiefs in Super Rugby and further experience with Scottish club Glasgow Warriors.\n\nRennie, who also has close ties with Johnson, has previously quashed any link with the Wallabies role, pointing out he had signed an extension with Glasgow that takes him through to the middle of next year. That hasn\u2019t stopped the 55-year-old\u2019s name being continually linked with Australia.", "description": "Michael Cheika confirmed he won\u2019t seek reappointment as Wallabies coach after Australia\u2019s quarter-final exit at the Rugby World Cup", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d474f3f042e6bea0b50db240f67f191bfc02f03/350_211_2945_1767/master/2945.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=84e01378dcb8fdd51670ffcdb3529121", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
