It allows for limited exceptions.\n\nLawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights filed a constitutional challenge. They asked the judge to stop the law from becoming enforceable while litigation is pending.\n\nLawyers for the state have argued that the law is constitutional and should be allowed to take effect as planned on Jan. 1.\n\nU.S. District Judge Steve Jones is scheduled to hear arguments from both sides on Monday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A federal judge is set to hear arguments over whether Georgia's restrictive new abortion law should be allowed to take effect while a legal challenge is pending.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
