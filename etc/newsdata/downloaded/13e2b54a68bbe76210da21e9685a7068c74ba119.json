Sports, physical education, cultural activities and outings, and coaching are included in the list of environments that \"facilitate\" the incidents.\n\nEthical responsibility\n\nSome pupils have gone as far as dropping out of school due to pupil-teacher relationships, which are among the top five types of alleged misconduct cases reported to the SACE.\n\nIronically, the SACE exceeded its target of training 10 000 teachers on the professional code of ethics for that year by 645, according to its report.\n\n\"At that meeting, [the] SACE was clear that irrespective of how small the age gap between a learner and an educator might be, there is a line that should not be crossed. He remains a learner and she remains an educator,\" Mbinqo-Gigaba said.\n\nShe commended the school for encouraging boys to speak up if they have been affected, and noted that Viotti had resigned.\n\nShe recognised that the pupil was 18 and the relationship was consensual, but stressed that teachers have an ethical responsibility.\n\n\"Even if a learner is above the age of consent, there is still a lot of dynamics at play and he remains a school child,\" said Mbinqo-Gigaba.\n\n\"We call on parents to speak to their children and make them realise that there is nothing shameful in coming forward if they had experienced the same treatment from the teacher.\"\n\nSchool conducting investigation\n\nLast weekend, the news broke that Viotti had been in a relationship with the 18-year-old pupil at the prestigious school in Rondebosch, Cape Town, which has produced many of the country's top businesspeople.\n\nAlthough he is 18, the school considered it a violation of the SACE's code of ethics.\n\nBishops principal Guy Pearson said it had also brought in a team of psychologists to assist where needed at the school, and it was conducting an investigation.\n\nNo criminal case has been laid.\n\nIt said that it seemed there were even more pupils affected.\n\nViotti's family appointed well-known lawyer William Booth to represent their interests and one of his first tasks this week was to get a video of her removed from a porn site.\n\nBooth stressed that sharing the video was illegal in terms of the law.\n\nIt was taken down on Thursday at the request of the copyright holder, according to a notice on the porn site.\n\nWestern Cape police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said that no criminal case had been opened regarding the matter.", "description": "Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Basic Education says that while an 18-year-old Bishops Diocesan College pupil involved in a reported relationship with a 30-year-old teacher is of legal age of consent, he is also still a school pupil and there are power dynamics at play.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2864/c8852f63a3084a2b80bac8cc1ac721c7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
