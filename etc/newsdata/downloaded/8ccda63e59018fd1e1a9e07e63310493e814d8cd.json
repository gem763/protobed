Tuesday ABC will air an interview conducted by news anchor Amy Robach with Hunter Biden. The Democrat debate scheduled Tuesday night in Ohio will be co-hosted by The New York Times and CNN. That\u2019s a bit awkward, isn\u2019t it?\n\nThe debates will be moderated by CNN anchors Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett and Times national editor Marc Lacey. An \u201cunnamed advisor\u201d is putting out the word, reported by Peter Doocy on FNC, that they think the Biden scandal isn\u2019t just bad for Biden but for all the Democrat candidates. If other candidates repeat the \u201cdiscredited lies\u201d about Biden and his son, they \u201cwould be making a profound statement about themselves.\u201d Nice campaign you\u2019ve got there. It\u2019d be too bad if it blew up.\n\nAs Ed wrote, there are no \u201cdiscredited lies\u201d about the Bidens. Nothing has been proven incorrect about the fact that Hunter Biden gets some very sweet gigs by using his father\u2019s position in politics. And, he does it with foreign companies and money. The Biden campaign is showing a disturbing pattern of bullying and expressing thinly veiled threats against the media and the other candidates in order to avoid having to answer some hard questions.\n\nDoes anyone think Hunter will be grilled over his past behavior and how exactly he got the job with the Ukrainian energy company in the first place? How about the money from China for his hedge fund business? I\u2019d like to know how he got the membership on the board of the energy company \u2013 who set up his contacts in order to receive the offer, and what was expected of Hunter Biden. What exactly did the job entail? And who set up the contact in China for the huge money infusion into his hedge fund? What was expected in return? I don\u2019t think any of this happened because of Hunter\u2019s knowledge, skills, or resume. A person would have to be incredibly naive to think Hunter was able to enrich himself as he did if it wasn\u2019t for his father\u2019s name and 40 years in the swamp.\n\nWhy was ABC chosen for the interview? Hunter\u2019s attorney has released a rather lengthy statement on Medium. Essentially he promises to not do what he\u2019s been doing, though he did nothing wrong when his father becomes president. The sense of entitlement is strong. If he was doing no wrong, why does he promise to conduct himself differently if his father sits in the Oval Office?\n\nHunter makes the following commitment: Under a Biden Administration, Hunter will readily comply with any and all guidelines or standards a President Biden may issue to address purported conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts, including any restrictions related to overseas business interests. In any event, Hunter will agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign owned companies. He will continue to keep his father personally uninvolved in his business affairs, while availing himself as necessary and appropriate to the Office of the White House Counsel to help inform his application of the Biden Administration\u2019s guidelines or standards to his business decision-making.\n\nIs the ABC interview to distract from what will probably be another less than stellar performance by the elder Biden during the debate? The Biden campaign should have been cleaning up this story from the beginning. Why is Hunter just now sitting down for an interview? Why hasn\u2019t Joe Biden done an interview explaining his story? I think Hunter is finally coming out of hiding because President Trump called him out and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter?\u201d during his last campaign rallies. Perhaps Trump poked him and now he has to come forward.\n\nThe interview was conducted last weekend in Hunter\u2019s home in Los Angeles. Viewers are told \u201cno questions were off-limits.\u201d The network is spreading the interview out over several of the ABC\u2019s shows.\n\nHunter Biden sat down with ABC News anchor Amy Robach over the weekend at his home in Los Angeles for an exclusive interview, and no questions were off limits.
