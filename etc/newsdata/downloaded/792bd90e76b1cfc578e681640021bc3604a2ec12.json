One person even suggested that \u201ctoday isn\u2019t the day to market your brand or yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me show off my body and then make a half ass remark about 911. WTF,\u201d one commenter wrote.\n\n\u201cThis is just disrespectful and undermining to the magnitude of the events that occurred on that horrific day,\u201d said another.\n\nOne critic questioned the intent of the caption and asked, \u201cSorry...did you want us not to forget about the dress or the significance of September 11th?\u201d\n\nJust a couple of hours after first posting it, Cavallari edited her caption to simply say, \u201cNYC for 24hrs.\u201d\n\nFriends of the television personality have since come to her defense.\n\n\u201cPeople questioning your outfit in this photo is what is wrong with our country. you were working today. that was your outfit. you posted a pic and asked everyone to REMEMBER... people suck,\u201d Cavallari\u2019s hair colorist, Justin Anderson, commented. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t post a pic you\u2019d get shit and you get shit if you do... people need to pick better battles.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Cavallari didn\u2019t immediately respond to Yahoo Entertainment\u2019s request for comment. However, Page Six reports that she has already fired the staffer responsible for the caption.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
