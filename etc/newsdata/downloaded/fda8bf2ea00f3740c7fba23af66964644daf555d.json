He must approve the appointment of all new ministers.\n\nTwo years ago he sacked four cabinet ministers, including two from the PPS, for failing to improve social and economic conditions in the Rif region, where protests flared in 2016.\n\nThe party\u2019s departure from government will make it easier for the PJD to share out cabinet posts among the other coalition members in a way the king approves, political analyst Mustapha Shimi said.\n\n(The story corrects paragraph five to show that the king can dismiss whole government if the prime minister resigns)", "description": "A member of Morocco's governing coalition said on Friday it would join the opposition ahead of a reshuffle requested by King Mohammed VI, citing disagreements with its partners in government.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
