Her lawyers have argued that she should serve those 14 days in a California, low-risk federal prison.\n\n\"I think this is the right sentence here,\" said federal judge Indira Talwani.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

I am sorry to my daughter Sophia, and Georgia, and I am sorry to my husband,\" Huffman, who was accompanied to the court by her actor husband William H Macy, said. \"I have betrayed them.\"\n\nShe continued, saying that telling her daughter about the cheating was the hardest part of the ordeal: \"I can only say, I am so sorry Sophia. I was frightened, I was stupid, and I was so wrong. I am deeply ashamed of what I've done. I take full responsibility for my actions. I will deserve whatever punishment you give me.\"\n\nBefore that, prosecutors had argued forcefully for prison time, saying that the measure is necessary in this case in order to ensure that justice is served \u2014 and that Huffman does not get off with an easy sentence because of her considerably high position in society.\n\n\"Prison is the great leveller. Prison is necessary here,\" a federal prosecutor, seeking one month in prison for Huffman, said. \"She did this once, but she planned to do this again, signalling an inherent disregard for the laws that govern our society.\"\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Her lawyers had said that one year of probation alongside 250 hours of community service and a $20,000 fine was an adequate punishment.\n\nShe is the first of nearly three dozen wealthy parents to be sentenced. The results have been watched closely to see if they signal that the other parents might receive harsh or lenient sentences, and some questions have been raised as to whether the white, rich defendants will be treated differently than if they were nonwhite and poor.\n\nThe maximum sentence for Huffman\u2019s crime, a felony, was 20 years in prison.", "description": "Actor\u00a0Felicity Huffman has been sentenced to 14 days in prison\u00a0for her part in America\u2019s largest college admissions cheating case, in which wealthy parents have been accused in a widespread conspiracy to cheat and game the US university entrance system.
