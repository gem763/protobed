Pictured: Strupp, left, and her boyfriend, Stojan, after she finished treatment\n\n'I was horrified, scared and paralyzed with fear,' Strupp told Metro of hearing her diagnosis.\n\n'Never in my life did I hear about vulvar melanoma.'\n\nMelanoma begins in the melanocytes, a type of skin cell that makes melanin and gives skin a tan or brown color.\n\nMelanomas of the vulva and vagina are rare, making up less than two percent of melanoma cases in women and not related to sun exposure.\n\nSigns and symptoms may include a lump or bump, itching, pain, bleeding or irregular discharge from the vagina.\n\nMost vulvar melanomas are either black or dark brown, but they can appear as white, pink or red.\n\nThe American Society of Clinical Oncology estimates that more than 6,000 US women will be diagnosed with vulvar cancer in 2019 and that more than 1,200 will die\n\nThe five-year survival rate for women with vulvar cancer is 71 percent.\n\nStrupp underwent surgery to remove the cancer and then 12 immunotherapy treatments - which boosts the body's natural defenses to fight cancer - over course of a year.\n\nStrupp's gynecologist biopsied the bump in August 2018 and sent it off for testing. One month later, in September, Strupp (left and right) was diagnosed with stage two vulvar melanoma, a rare form of skin cancer\n\nStrupp underwent surgery to remove the cancer and then 12 sessions of immunotherapy over the course of one year, and is now cancer-free. Pictured: Strupp, center, with her parents\n\nStrupp shared posts about her treatment, which she completed last month, on social media and said she had made friends with other cancer survivors around the world.\n\n'I've talked to and spoken to people all around the world - Germany, Argentina, [and] England - and in the US,' she said.\n\n'Not everyone has my specific melanoma...or some are starting their immunotherapy and want to know what it's like.\n\n'Or maybe they just want someone to connect with so they know when they explain their side effects, you can understand.'\n\nAccording to Metro, Strupp will need to see a doctor every four to six months to make sure her cancer is at bay.\n\n'Cancer took so much away from me [but] I won't let it take me down and change me. I'm not a cancer victim, I'm defeating it,' she said.", "description": "Marisa Strupp, 29, from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was diagnosed in September 2018 with stage two vulvar melanoma, a rare form of skin cancer, after she saw a bump on her inner labia.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/20/19221462-0-image-a-4_1570044890232.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
