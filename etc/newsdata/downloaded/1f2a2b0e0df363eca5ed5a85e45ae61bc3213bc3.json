But once a stadium security officer wanted to carry out a physical inspection, Sahar told the officer she was a woman. She was then arrested by authorities.\n\nAccording to MizanOnline, the judiciary news agency, the reason for Sahar\u2019s arrest was \u201cdamaging public chastity and insulting a judiciary officer.\u201d\n\nIranian women are not allowed to watch men's sporting events at local stadiums.\n\nSomaye Malekian/ABC News\n\nSahar set herself on fire last week to protest her possible imprisonment. She died at a hospital Monday after suffering severe burns on 90% of her body. Iranian and international social media reacted to her death and the hashtag BlueGirl, the color of her favorite team, Esteghlal, has gone viral.\n\nParvaneh Salahsouri, a reformist lawmaker, said Sahar was \"Iran's girl.\"\n\n\u201cShe was not just a #blue-girl, Sahar was #Iran\u2019s_girl,\" Salahsouri posted on Twitter. We are all responsible for the imprisonment and burnings of Sahars of this land, where men command women and take away their primitive human rights.\u201d\n\nSome have said Sahar\u2019s mental condition was the reason she set herself on fire.\n\nSahar was bipolar, according to her sister, who was interviewed by Rokna, a local news outlet, on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe had presented the medical documents to the court, but she was treated as a healthy person after she insulted one of the officers,\u201d the sister said.\n\nLast November, authorities allowed hundreds of Iranian women to attend Azadi Stadium to watch an official soccer match for the first time. The permission was granted after Gianni Infantino, head of FIFA, urged Iranian sport officials to allocate some seats for women.\n\nJonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nSome claimed on social media that the presence of women during that game was largely arranged and most of the seats in the women\u2019s section had been filled by female police officers in plain clothes.\n\nIn August, Forough Alaei, an award-winning photojournalist who had photographed an Iranian girl disguising herself as a man to attend a stadium, was arrested. Alaei was released on bail a few days later.\n\nSahar's death has added to the growing chorus of criticism of segregation in Iranian sports. Some are asking male fans not to attend the stadiums while others suggest men should protest by shouting slogans and holding signs. Some argue that FIFA, the world's soccer governing body, should ban Iran\u2019s soccer federation.", "description": "An Iranian woman, caught trying to watch a soccer match dressed as a man, has died after setting herself on fire outside a courthouse.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/iran-soccer-01-ap-jc-190910_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
