Because, I had lost myself a bit.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClarifying, she added: \u2018I think it happened as my relationship with Brad was coming to an end, then at the beginning of our separation.\n\n\u2018It was a complicated moment, where I didn\u2019t recognise myself anymore, where I had become\u2026 how can I say\u2026 smaller, almost insignificant, even if it wasn\u2019t necessarily visible.\u2019\n\n\u2018I felt a deep and genuine sadness, I was hurt,\u2019 she added.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
