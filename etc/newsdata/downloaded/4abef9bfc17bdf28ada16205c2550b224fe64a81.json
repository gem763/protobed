Geoffrey Boycott stuck to it and he got the runs in the end.\"\n\nMay resigned earlier this year after repeatedly failing to pass her Brexit deal. She nominated Boycott and former English cricket captain Andrew Strauss for knighthoods on her Resignation Honours list, while Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick will receive a damehood.\n\nQueen Elizabeth grants Resignation Honours at the request of an outgoing prime minister.\n\nMay previously mocked her predecessor David Cameron's decision to knight his communications director Craig Oliver, saying that seeing his name on Cameron's resignation honours list had given her a retching feeling.\n\nHowever May too has also chosen to honour some of her closest advisers and allies, with her Director of Communications Robbie Gibb, chief Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins, European adviser Peter Storr and de facto deputy David Lidington all receiving knighthoods.\n\nMay's former joint Chief of Staffs Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy, an architect of May's approach to Brexit who has been outspoken in criticising his old boss' strategy since he stopped working for her, are in line for lesser honours, while their replacement, Gavin Barwell, has been nominated for a peerage.\n\nKim Darroch, Britain's former ambassador to Washington who quit in July after a leak of his memos to a British newspaper prompted a stinging attack from U.S. President Donald Trump, has also been nominated to sit in Britain's upper chamber, the House of Lords.\n\n(Reporting by Alistair Smout; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "description": "Bowled out by Brexit, former PM May honours cricket hero Geoffrey Boycott", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/wires/05/21/33/06/1000x563_bowled-out-by-brexit-former-pm-may-honours-cricket-hero-geoffrey-boycott.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
