The Markets Say No", "language": "en", "text": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- At last we have a date for the inevitable U.K. general election, or at least a range of dates: Dec. 9 to Dec. 12. The opposition Labour Party has agreed to back the ruling Conservative Party\u2019s legislation for an early election, which will be put to Parliament on Tuesday.\n\nThe pound\u2019s instant reaction was to strengthen versus the dollar, a somewhat surprising response to what will be a fevered six weeks of opinion polls and uncertainty. The fracturing of British politics along Brexiter and non-Brexiter lines makes elections fiendishly difficult to call and voter polling hard to trust. But it\u2019s the overriding expectation of currency traders that Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s championing of Brexit will win him a majority.\n\nRecent polls have shown a consistent lead for his party over Labour of 10%-15% or more, which would probably be enough to secure victory. In that event he would return to Parliament with his Brexit deal early next year and pass it without fear of significant alteration. Even that sniff of some kind of resolution to the three-year Brexit saga is enough to cheer some sterling bulls.\n\nOf course, politics is never without risk. Johnson will look at his predecessor Theresa May\u2019s last campaign, where her initial poll lead of 18% evaporated to 2%, resulting in a hung parliament and the current Brexit impasse. But Johnson is a better campaigner.\n\nAt the same time, such are the depths of Corbyn\u2019s unpopularity that even a defeat for Johnson would probably mean victory for some kind of second referendum-supporting coalition of Labour, the centrist Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party. That would naturally water down many of the hard left policies supported by Corbyn that have so bothered investors such as nationalizations and wealth redistribution.\n\nWhile fears of a no-deal Brexit have tended to dominate headlines, the prospect of a Corbyn government has always been a bigger negative for the pound. The threat of no-deal is now pretty much eradicated, as the Conservatives will campaign on bringing forward Johnson's deal with the European Union. And Corbyn\u2019s threat looks much diminished too. So overall there\u2019s less downside risk for sterling.\n\nIt will be a bumpy road up to Britain\u2019s first December election for nearly a century, but if Johnson keeps his nose in front then the pound should continue to slowly appreciate.\n\nJust remember that the U.K. and the global economy aren\u2019t in a strong place so any post-election or Brexit bounce is going to be tempered, especially as 2020 will be the year of negotiating a future trade deal with the EU \u2014 a thorny prospect. There\u2019s still the very slight danger of the U.K. exiting without a deal under World Trade Organization trade terms at the end of the current planned transition period in just over 14 months time. Traders are right to welcome this election, without getting carried away.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Marcus Ashworth at mashworth4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nMarcus Ashworth is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering European markets.
