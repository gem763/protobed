Photo: Peter Nicholls/Reuters\n\nThe London Stock Exchange Group (LSE.L) has unanimously rejected a takeover bid from Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) (0388.HK).\n\nLSE said in a statement on Friday lunchtime that the board had \u201cconsidered the unsolicited, preliminary, and highly conditional proposal\u201d and concluded it has \u201cfundamental flaws.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Board has fundamental concerns about the key aspects of the Conditional Proposal: strategy, deliverability, form of consideration, and value,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nLSE said it would not engage further with HKEX and would instead focus on its acquisition of data business Refinitiv.\n\nHKEX surprised the market on Wednesday with a \u00a332bn bid for LSE. It said a merger of the two businesses would \u201cconnect East and West\u201d and \u201coffer customers greater innovation, risk management, and trading opportunities.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Twitter's UK profit jumps \u2014 but tax bill falls\n\nAnalysts said the deal looked unlikely from the start.\n\n\u201cThere are only few instances of cross-continental exchange mergers that have been completed successfully, as nationalistic concerns often arise,\u201d UBS analysts Michael Werner and Federico Braga said in a note to clients on Friday.\n\n\u201cGiven the recent business disruptions in Hong Kong, we would argue that this adds to the potential perceived risk of a proposed LSE/HKEX merger.\u201d\n\nAnalyst Benjamin Goy at Deutsche Bank said the deal would be \u201cstrategically and politically challenging.\u201d\n\nShares in HKEX fell sharply on Thursday in Hong Kong as investors guessed the deal would be rejected. The stock price fall wiped about $1bn off the company\u2019s value.\n\nREAD MORE: More pain for Neil Woodford investors with \u00a342m write-down\n\nLSE shares jumped by 10% on Wednesday when the deal was first announced but the rally quickly faded.\n\nShortly after the rejection of the takeover proposal on Friday, LSE shares were trading up 1.1% on the day. The stock had been trading as much as 1.8% higher prior to the announcement.\n\nLSE has been the target of several takeover bids over the years, most recently a proposed merger with Deutsche Borse in 2016. That deal was blocked by EU regulators on competition grounds.", "description": "The board said the takeover proposal has 'fundamental flaws' and unanimously rejected the bid.", "authors": ["Oscar Williams-Grut", "Senior City Correspondent", "Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XnT0zDMvhDMyTaBuu4EM2Q--~B/aD0zMDEyO3c9NTE3MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/9c963db0-bff7-11e9-bdf7-b5e7df761756", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
