The department will then assist the relevant students to complete the relevant forms concerned.\n\n\"Since the offer was made, to date, the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development has not received such a list from the student leaders nor such a request, nor indeed any relevant application for a presidential pardon, nor any application for any expungement of a criminal record.\n\n''The offer by the department to assist the relevant students still stands. The hands of the department are tied if we do not receive any applications,\" said Lamola.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
