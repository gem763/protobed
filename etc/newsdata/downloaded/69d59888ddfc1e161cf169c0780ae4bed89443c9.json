Today\u2019s update promises to rectify that problem, provided I\u2019m running the Windows 10 Creators Update. Adobe and Microsoft have been working closely on this, according to Panos Panay, chief of Microsoft Devices, \u201cto ensure Photoshop scales perfectly on any Windows 10 device, from the 12.3-inch Surface Pro all the way to the 28-inch Surface Studio.\u201d\n\nOnce updated, Photoshop CC will tie in with the Display Settings menu in Windows and then automatically adjust to the scaling setting you choose there (going from 100 percent to 400 percent, with 25-percent increments in between). This isn\u2019t quite as granular or as accessible as a direct Photoshop scaling option, but it\u2019s an improvement on the even more limited options we had until now. Adobe says it\u2019s also made sure that displays of mismatched resolutions \u2014 like a 4K laptop alongside a lower-resolution desktop monitor \u2014 work smoothly together.\n\nAs to the Select Subject addition, that comes from the Adobe Sensei development team, which works to implementing machine learning (ML) into the company\u2019s software suite. Like Pixelmator Pro\u2019s Quick Selection tool, the Select Subject button in Photoshop CC uses ML to automatically figure out the proper contours of complex objects and identify your subject for you. I tried it with the selfie below, and, well, the initial result isn\u2019t especially thrilling, but perhaps it could still streamline editing workflows with simpler subjects.\n\nCorrection January 23rd, 3:44PM ET: Clarified that the new scaling options are not controllable within Photoshop itself, but are tied to the screen size adjustments that users make in their Windows settings.", "description": "Adobe\u2019s Photoshop CC now supports HiDPI displays with better graphical interface scaling.", "authors": ["Vlad Savov", "Jan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XOG57vpqBAo_EjHd97xdVB8codg=/0x40:1350x747/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10082359/Ps_Cover_1.jpg", "published_at": "2018-01-23"}
