He gets an Arizona defense that\u2019s yielded league-highs to tight ends in catches (17), yards (273), and touchdowns (three) so far this season.\n\n[Play in Yahoo\u2019s NFL $500K Baller. $10 entry fee and $50K to first place]\n\nMurray hasn\u2019t racked up TDs or rushing yards yet, but he just got 8.7 YPA in Baltimore and should pick apart a vulnerable Panthers secondary in what projects to be the week\u2019s fastest-paced game.\n\nThe Kyler Murray explosion is coming. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNew Orleans Saints @ Seattle Seahawks\n\nSit: Latavius Murray\n\nStart: DK Metcalf\n\nThe loss of Drew Brees will have a dramatic effect on the Saints offense, which makes Murray an extremely risky fantasy start. Don\u2019t be surprised when New Orleans turns to Taysom Hill, who forward-thinking fantasy gamers in Superflex leagues should be adding now, thanks to his rushing ability.\n\nMetcalf is the real deal and ranks seventh in WOPR during his rookie campaign, and he gets a Saints defense that\u2019s allowed the most fantasy points to his primary side this season.\n\nHouston Texans @ Los Angeles Chargers\n\nStart: Will Fuller\n\nStart in DFS: Austin Ekeler ($25)\n\nFuller is off to a quiet start, but his aDOT is an absurd 24.3 yards, and he should benefit Sunday by seeing more targets thanks to Casey Hayward shadowing DeAndre Hopkins.\n\nStory continues\n\nHouston had the No. 1 run defense DVOA last year but has been gashed for an NFL-high 6.0 YPC through two weeks, and few running backs are getting opportunities like Ekeler, whom I have as my No. 2 RB in Week 3.\n\nBaltimore Ravens @ Kansas City Chiefs\n\nStart: Marquise Brown, DeMarcus Robinson\n\nBrown\u2019s rookie season was expected to start slowly coming off an injury and without much preseason work, but instead, he\u2019s racked up a team-leading 18 targets while leading the NFL in yards per route run by a mile. Moreover, the wideout ranks top-10 in air yards, target share and WOPR, with the latter\u2019s leaderboard looking like this: 1) Keenan Allen 2) DeAndre Hopkins 3) Michael Thomas 4) T.Y. Hilton 5) Marquise Brown 6) Odell Beckham. Brown possesses the biggest speed advantage this week in a highly favorable matchup against Kansas City that\u2019s easily the biggest total in Week 3. Hollywood\u2019s ECR is WR28, but he\u2019s top-10 on my board this week.\n\nIt\u2019s clear the Chiefs will trade big games from their wideouts, but Robinson remains highly intriguing as long as Tyreek Hill is sidelined. The Chiefs are averaging an NFL-high 410.5 passing yards per game and haven\u2019t even played at home yet \u2014 not to mention, seemingly all of their running backs are banged up \u2014 so Robinson should be started with confidence this week.\n\nDenver Broncos @ Green Bay Packers\n\nSit: Courtland Sutton\n\nStart: Marquez Valdes-Scantling\n\nGreen Bay enters with an impressive defense that\u2019s ceded the second-lowest Passer Rating and just 5.9 YPA in the early going, also holding outside receivers to the fifth-fewest fantasy points. Sutton comes in battling sore ribs and has taken a clear backseat to Emmanuel Sanders as Denver\u2019s No. 1 receiver.\n\nWhile Davante Adams will have his hands full with shadow corner Chris Harris (who\u2019s moved around and not been relegated to the slot this season), MVS and his downfield speed should benefit from playing a defense that\u2019s still searching for its first sack of the year.\n\nDetroit Lions @ Philadelphia Eagles\n\nStart in DFS: Kenny Golladay ($20)\n\nStart: Nelson Agholor\n\nThe Eagles continue to struggle mightily against outside receivers, having allowed the most fantasy points to them over the first two weeks. The Lions are slow but will be forced to throw while trying to keep pace with Philly\u2019s offense, and Golladay has already racked up 19 targets while ranking fourth in air yards this season, so he should be considered a borderline top-5 WR play this week, while Marvin Jones is top-20ish.\n\nThe Eagles are expected to miss Alshon Jeffery, DeSean Jackson, and Dallas Goedert against a Detroit defense that\u2019s allowed the second-fewest fantasy points to tight ends, so Agholor should see good volume this week.\n\nCincinnati Bengals @ Buffalo Bills\n\nSit: John Ross\n\nStart: Frank Gore\n\nRoss got a garbage time TD last week and will lose targets once A.J. Green returns, but he\u2019s also not some fluke, as he ranks top-15 in air yards and clearly has game-changing speed. But this week he belongs on benches, as regression will hit in the way of a Bills secondary that\u2019s held opponents to an NFL-low 4.9 YPA this season.\n\nIt's shocking recommending a 36-year-old running back, but Gore dominated touches (and snaps) last week, and Devin Singletary has missed practice all week with a hamstring injury. The Bills are near-touchdown home favorites and facing a Bengals front seven that\u2019s been gashed for the most fantasy points by running backs this season.\n\nOakland Raiders @ Minnesota Vikings\n\nSit: Tyrell Williams\n\nStart: Vikings defense\n\nWilliams has emerged as a fine fantasy option as Oakland\u2019s No. 1 WR, but he\u2019s better on benches in Week 3 while shadowed by Xavier Rhodes.\n\nAfter what little Oakland showed on offense at home against Kansas City last week, it could get ugly against a Vikings defense that plays especially tough in Minnesota. With a 10AM body-clock game and Josh Jacobs banged up, the odds are stacked against the Raiders on Sunday.\n\nNew York Jets @ New England Patriots\n\nSit: Robby Anderson\n\nStart in DFS: Sony Michel ($21)\n\nAnderson has opened the season with shadow coverage from Tre\u2019Davious White, Denzel Ward, and now Stephon Gilmore. He\u2019ll have third-string QB Luke Falk throwing to him against a Patriots secondary that\u2019s ceded an NFL-low 43.8 Passer Rating and is the only team yet to allow a touchdown this season.\n\nMichel lost a fumble last week and has yet to be targeted this year, but he remains the heavy favorite for carries (he saw 21 last week) on a team that\u2019s 22-point home favorites. Few running backs are more likely to score than Michel in Week 3.\n\nMiami Dolphins @ Dallas Cowboys\n\nSit: All Dolphins\n\nStart: Devin Smith\n\nJosh Rosen gets his first start for Miami, and he\u2019ll be facing a major disadvantage in the trenches. Miami sports a -92 point differential and now goes on the road for the first time this season.\n\nWith Michael Gallup out and Amari Cooper locked up with shadow corner Xavien Howard, Smith is a sleeper this week (along with Randall Cobb). Dallas doesn\u2019t figure to have to throw a ton, but points should be plentiful against a Miami defense that\u2019s been annihilated for a league-high 11.9 YPA with an 8:0 TD:INT ratio and a near-perfect 155.9 Passer Rating. Smith\u2019s a former second-round pick with an 89th percentile 40-time who should burn Eric Rowe, so he\u2019s an intriguing flier.\n\nAtlanta Falcons @ Indianapolis Colts\n\nStart: Austin Hooper, Jordan Wilkins\n\nHooper has already racked up 15 targets during a couple of tough matchups to open the year, and after finishing top-10 in looks inside the 10-yard line last season, he\u2019s going to start spending more time in the end zone soon.\n\nI\u2019d love a healthy Marlon Mack in this spot, but he has a history of lower leg injuries and is dealing with a calf strain, so let this be your official alert to go check if Wilkins is available on your waiver wire. He has really good upside running behind that offensive line, should he get an opportunity.\n\nNew York Giants @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nStart: Sterling Shepard, Jameis Winston\n\nShepard should return from his concussion against an improved Bucs defense, but M.J. Stewart and company were gutted for the most fantasy points by the slot last season, and Daniel Jones will be hard-pressed not to be an upgrade over Eli Manning. Shepard is New York\u2019s clear WR1 right now.\n\nWinston has gotten off to a shaky start, but he\u2019s coming off a mini-bye and facing a Giants defense that struggles to rush the passer and also has an inexperienced secondary, which is the right combination for the QB to finally take advantage of his loaded weapons (expect O.J. Howard to get fed Sunday).\n\nPittsburgh Steelers @ San Francisco 49ers\n\nSit: James Conner\n\nStart: Raheem Mostert\n\nConner looks good to go with his knee issue, and Mason Rudolph might not be as huge of a downgrade as feared, but the QB will be making his first career start across the country against a vastly improved SF pass rush. The 49ers have allowed the fifth-fewest fantasy points to running backs this season, and Sunday will be their first home game, so Conner\u2019s expectations need to be held in check.\n\nMostert recorded a 40-time in the 96th percentile, and his speed just jumps off the screen. The 49ers employ a full-blown committee (including Jeff Wilson sometimes at the goal line), but Mostert led the team\u2019s backfield in snaps last week, and it\u2019s a highly productive Kyle Shanahan system that\u2019s produced 178.5 rushing yards per game so far in 2019 (Matt Breida is also one of the bigger in-game injury risks in the league). And if you want to dig really deep, Richie James is a sleeper, as he\u2019ll be up against Mike Hilton, who\u2019s ceded the most fantasy points to the slot this season.\n\nLos Angeles Rams @ Cleveland Browns\n\nSit: Jared Goff, Jarvis Landry\n\nOver his last nine road games, Goff has gotten just 7.19 YPA with an 11:10 TD:INT ratio, so there are many better QB options this week.\n\nLandry continues to look like a poor fit with Baker Mayfield (he saw 94 targets in the first half of last season compared to 55 over the second half), and he\u2019ll face off (why remake perfection?) against a Rams defense that\u2019s stingy versus the slot.\n\nChicago Bears @ Washington Redskins\n\nStart: David Montgomery\n\nSit: Adrian Peterson\n\nMontgomery owners took a big sigh of relief when he dominated snaps in Chicago\u2019s backfield last week after a quiet opener, and the rookie actually has the third-most air yards among running backs behind only Alvin Kamara and teammate Tarik Cohen. With a strong defense that should overwhelm Washington and a quarterback Matt Nagy wants to hide, Monday night should be a recipe for a big workload from Montgomery.\n\nPeterson continues to have Washington\u2019s backfield mostly to himself, but a touchdown saved an otherwise dreadful game last week that saw him rush for just 25 yards on 10 carries, and he\u2019s now up against a Bears front seven that allowed the fewest fantasy points to running backs last season. Meanwhile, rookie Terry McLaurin looks like a monster in the making and will be a prime trade target next week if he has a quiet game in this difficult matchup.\n\nFollow the Yahoo fantasy football crew on Twitter: Andy Behrens, Dalton Del Don, Brad Evans, Matt Harmon, Liz Loza, Scott Pianowski and Tank Williams\n\nListen to the Yahoo Fantasy Football Podcast", "description": "Fantasy football expert Dalton Del Don gets you ready for Week 3 with his lineup advice for every game, and he thinks Kyler Murray should be a \"start\" with confidence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tRlzakwkXn8eD5HXEomPvQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Fc.yL42IbrxF.cnsOoy2iQ--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/c0f778e0-dbb8-11e9-b16f-7105ab6ae125", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
