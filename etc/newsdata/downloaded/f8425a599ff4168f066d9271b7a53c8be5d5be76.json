Richard Nixon was forced to resign when the scope of his domestic political spying operation was exposed. Today, President Trump openly calls for foreign powers to investigate his political rivals from the south lawn of the White House.\n\nWhat do Republicans in Congress say? They have settled, after a few false starts, on a \u201che did not really mean it\u201d defense. The party of Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan is now defending the overt corruption of our foreign policy for the benefit of the reelection campaign of Trump. At least Neville Chamberlain pursued his appeasement policy because he earnestly thought it would protect his people in 1939. Republicans in Congress harbor no such illusions. Lost in the quest for the explicit quid pro quo with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is a far more grievous violation of the constitutional oath that Trump took when he entered office.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee recently released text messages between senior U.S. diplomats and a senior Ukrainian aide to President Zelensky. The texts conclusively establish the president\u2019s overt use of U.S. government personnel and resources to secure a foreign government\u2019s assistance in interfering with the 2020 election. The president\u2019s brazen willingness to employ the federal government power as if it was a division of The Trump Organization is the embodiment of corrupt intent.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut let no one feign surprise. Throughout his term, the president has systematically blurred the lines as to where he, his office, his government, his business interests and his campaign started and stopped. He asked the FBI director FBI for a pledge of personal loyalty, said it was the job of the attorney general to \u201cprotect\u201d him, mixed campaign events with official presidential duties, called a law-abiding intelligence community whistleblower a \u201cspy,\u201d and allowed his staff to use their offices to enrich themselves \u2013 and him.\n\nHe does not acknowledge the distinctions between himself, his business, his campaign, and the office of the presidency that he temporarily holds. To President Trump, allegiance to the country begins and ends with allegiance to him. For all the talk about the president\u2019s failure to adhere to constitutional norms, his refusal to separate himself, his financial interests, or his electoral interests from true American interests is his arguably his most fundamental offense against his oath of office.\n\nAnd, yet, nothing has been strong enough to overcome the sheer constitutional authority Article II grants unto the president of the United States. The result is that President Trump has made a governing philosophy out of Richard Nixon\u2019s infamous mantra: [W]hen the president does it, that means it is not illegal.\u201d\n\nThe question now is really: How far did he go? We now know, for example, that he overtly asked China\u2019s President Xi to open an investigation into Joe Biden Joe BidenPelosi hits back at Trump over letter: 'Only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy' Clinton jokes she could 'obviously' beat Trump in 2020 'rematch' Gowdy in talks to join Trump's impeachment defense team MORE and his son, Hunter. Reports indicate that President Trump also told Russian officials in 2017 that he wasn\u2019t concerned about their election interference.\n\nHow many other calls, or asks, exist? If Trump was willing to invite the Chinese, the Russians, and the Ukrainians to interfere in American elections, why would he deny any other country the same opportunity? Iran and North Korea have begun programs to interfere in our elections as well, doubtless emboldened by the president\u2019s complacency.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhether due to fatigue, political cowardice, or the proximity of the 2020 election, neither Trump\u2019s base nor congressional Republicans care that the president is perversely employing Article II to obstruct congressional oversight, subvert the rule of law, and justify his efforts to employ a foreign government to interfere in his next election.\n\nPerhaps, as happened during Watergate, some Republicans will find their voice \u2013 however feeble (See Romney, Mitt) \u2013 to defend the Constitution. Some of them might even join their Democratic colleagues and stand up for the constitutional prerogatives of the legislative branch. But, again, no one should feign surprise when they don\u2019t.\n\nChris Gagin is an attorney and adviser to Republicans for the Rule of Law.", "description": "President Trump faces impeachment for conduct every other generation of Americans would consider both abhorrent abuses of power and inherently undemocratic.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald2_093019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
