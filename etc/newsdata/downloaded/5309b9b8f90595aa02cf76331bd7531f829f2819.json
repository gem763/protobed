U.S. gold futures GCcv1 were little changed at\n\n$1,490.80.\n\n\"We seem to be at a bit of an equilibrium around here, stuck\n\nbetween $1,480 and $1,520. If the Fed (U.S. Federal Reserve) is\n\nmore dovish in their outlook, it could be enough to drive gold\n\nhigher,\" said OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley.\n\n\"However, if the Fed holds rates, it would be negative for\n\ngold because that would probably see treasury yields move higher\n\nagain as well, which reduces gold's appeal as an investment\n\nasset.\"\n\nInvestors expect the Fed to lower interest rates by 0.25\n\npercentage point for a third time this year, according to CME\n\nGroup's FedWatch tool.\n\nHowever, only about a 30% chance of another cut in December\n\nhas been priced in, compared with about 70% earlier this month.\n\nMuted movement in Asian equities on Wednesday also aided\n\ngold, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside\n\nJapan down 0.16% from Tuesday's three-month\n\nhigh.
