They claimed that they managed to get away with the crimes for so long because of the Primbon, an ancient Javanese almanac that contains prophecies and guides for pretty much anything you\u2019d want to do in life.\n\n\n\nRudianto, 39, one of thieves who goes by only one name, believes his crime streak with partner M. Adnan Rifai, 27, came to an end because he accidentally miscalculated whether it was safe for him to attend a friend\u2019s wedding in Pakis, Magelang.\n\n\u201cI attended my friend\u2019s wedding, where police arrested me. Based on the calculations of the Javanese calendar, I shouldn\u2019t have gone to Pakis, but I went anyway,\u201d Rudianto told local media. His accomplice, Rifai, had already been arrested.\n\nRudianto and Rifai said they had robbed 28 locations across Central Java and Yogyakarta. At a press conference, Rudianto explained how he determined the dates to commit robberies.\n\n\u201cI use pitungan, a Javanese counting system. The calculations are based on the name of the village. So for instance, if it\u2019s Kliwon Friday (a date on the Javanese calendar), then there are eight Fridays, eight Kliwons, so that\u2019s 16. Then let\u2019s say the village\u2019s name is Magelang. Those letters correspond to Hanacaraka Datasalawa Padhajanya Magabathanga in the Primbon, which adds up to 18. Add that to 16 and you get 34, then divide that by 7,\u201d Rudianto explained in a way that only true Primbon enthusiasts would understand. Basically, each day and each letter corresponds to a certain value that Rudianto and Rifai used in committing crimes.\n\nAfter they calculate the date on which to commit a robbery, he then calculates which door he should exit from and which doors to avoid. Rudianto said the Primbon even includes instructions to calculate the exact ideal time to commit a robbery.\n\nWhich ancient Javanese mystics took it upon themselves to write all this?\n\nBut regardless of whether the Primbon method of calculation is effective or not, Assistant Chief of Magelang Police Ngadisa, who goes by only one name, said the duo managed to rob 31 sites in six cities over nine years.\n\n\u201cBased on our investigation, it appears they went after electronics like cell phones, TVs, and laptops,\u201d Ngadisa told local media.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of loot.", "description": "After avoiding police for nine years, two Indonesian thieves finally got what was coming to them.", "authors": ["Talia Slonim", "David Gilbert", "Meera Navlakha"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d64f89a824ec900083d0051/lede/1566898588330-Untitled-design-64.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*"}
