And reach and amplification was not represented in that speech,\" according to the journalist Sarah Frier, who was tweeting from the event.\n\nAt Georgetown, Zuckerberg talked about Facebook's decision not to censor political ads and described Facebook as a place that offers \"voice and inclusion.\" Zuckerberg had also tried to recharacterise the founding of Facebook as a reaction to the Iraq War. He said, \"If more people had a voice to share their experiences, maybe things would have gone differently,\" which was the first time he mentioned this.\n\nDorsey called him out on this, saying, \"There's some amount of revisionist history in all his storytelling. It takes away from the authenticity and the genuineness of what we're trying to do,\" according to Frier on Twitter.\n\nDorsey has thoughts on Zuckerberg saying the origin of Facebook's free speech ideals was the Iraq war:\"There's some amount of revisionist history in all his storytelling. It takes away from the authenticity and the genuineness of what we're trying to do.\" ?? \u2014 Sarah Frier (@sarahfrier) October 24, 2019\n\nDorsey, who cofounded Twitter nearly 15 years ago, has not been immune to criticism himself. Critics have blasted Twitter for not sufficiently cracking down on harassment and toxic speech on the platform. And Twitter's hands-off approach to US President Donald Trump, whose inflammatory tweets arguably violate Twitter's terms of use, has damaged Twitter's credibility in the eyes of many.\n\nWhen asked if he would join Libra, Facebook's cryptocurrency association, Dorsey said \"hell no,\" according to the Axios reporter Sara Fischer.\n\nDamn. @BuzzFeedBen asks @jack if he would join Libra. Jack: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hell no.\u00e2\u20ac\u009dJack: Cryptocurrency wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessary to make that thing work. Born out of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intention (not need) and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not consistent with what I personally believe and what I want our company to stand for. \u2014 Sara Fischer (@sarafischer) October 24, 2019\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Jack Dorsey took issue with Zuckerberg's recent comments on free speech and the founding of Facebook.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7188/ab0c1a9184c74ef0846e0792e21f60a7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
