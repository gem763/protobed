Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) officially endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on Sunday, endearingly calling him \u201cAmo Bernie\u201d and proclaiming he is \u201cnot going to sell us out.\u201d\n\nTlaib officially joined her far-left \u201cSquad\u201d members Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN) on Sunday in endorsing Sanders\u2019 presidential bid. In a formal endorsement video released Sunday, Tlaib praises \u201cAmo Bernie\u201d for standing up for the \u201cSquad\u201d after President Trump suggested that the \u201c\u2019Progressive\u2019 Democrat Congresswomen\u201d who constantly criticize the United States leave and fix other corrupt nations and \u201ccome back and show us how it is done.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmo Bernie is what I like to call him, which \u201camo\u201d means \u201cuncle\u201d in Arabic,\u201d Tlaib explains in the video.\n\n\u201cI think Amo Bernie, when he saw not just myself but my other sisters in service being attacked but this president, by this bully, for him there was no hesitation. He jumped on board and said \u2018What can I do to uplift you all? What can I do to support you all?'\u201d she continued.\n\nTlaib claimed that \u201cthis institution\u201d has not been ready for women such as herself and heaped praise on Sanders for continually supporting their progressive efforts.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he truly believes that women like us, women that this institution hasn\u2019t been ready for, that we feel supported. And from day one he\u2019s always made us feel like that,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m endorsing Amo Bernie Sanders because he understands that it\u2019s not just about policies and words but it\u2019s going to be also about completely transforming the structures in place that is hurting American people,\u201d she added:\n\n\"I am endorsing Amo Bernie Sanders because he's not gonna sell us out. He understands that it's not just about policies and about words, but it's going to be also about completely transforming the structures in place.\" \u2013@RashidaTlaib pic.twitter.com/3SaGZeOUT7 \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 27, 2019\n\nTlaib stressed that Sanders is \u201cnot going to sell us out,\u201d which some view as a veiled shot at other candidates in the Democrat field:\n\nI mean there\u2019s something incredibly inspiring about someone that we know is not going to sell us out, that\u2019s not going to bow down to these structures that are so built on racism, built on choosing those that are wealthy, that he\u2019s consistent in saying that he\u2019s with us first.\n\n\u201cHe will always choose us first,\u201d she added:\n\n\"I am endorsing Amo Bernie Sanders because he's not gonna sell us out. He understands that it's not just about policies and about words, but it's going to be also about completely transforming the structures in place.\" \u2013@RashidaTlaib pic.twitter.com/3SaGZeOUT7 \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 27, 2019\n\nTlaib also appeared alongside Sanders at a rally at Cass Tech High School in Detroit on Sunday.\n\n\u201cHe never once wavered in fighting for us, fighting for civil rights and equality,\u201d she told the crowd.\n\nSanders heaped praise on Tlaib for \u201cstanding up against the vulgarity and ugliness of Donald Trump\u201d and taking on the \u201cgreed and corruption of the economic establishment.\u201d\n\nSanders said:\n\nWhat Rashida has been doing in less than one year is become a national figure, not just in standing up against the vulgarity and ugliness of Donald Trump, but she has taken on in a very forceful way, the greed and corruption of the economic establishment and stood up to the political establishment as well.\n\n\u201cThank you (Shukran!) Amo @berniesanders or coming to our community to see firsthand and hear from the very people hurt by #corporategreed,\u201d Tlaib wrote following Sanders\u2019 visit. \u201cI am proud to endorse you for President of the United States\u201d:", "description": "Rep.
