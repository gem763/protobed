If it was eventually approved by the Commons a similar process of scrutiny would be carried out by peers in the Lords.\n\nFormer Tory MP Ken Clarke asked Mr Johnson whether he was about to table \"a reasonable timetable motion\" so MPs can \"complete the task of finalising the details of the withdrawal bill\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Richard Burgon: I would like to see Boris Johnson gone by Christmas\n\nIn reply, the PM said: \"I don't think the people of this country want a delay, I don't want a delay, I intend to press on but I'm afraid we now have to see what our EU friends will decide on our behalf that is the result of the decision that he [Mr Corbyn] took last night,\" he said.\n\nThe SNP has indicated it wants an extension to allow for a general election, while the Liberal Democrats say the PM needs to get an extension to allow a further referendum. Both parties would rather the UK revoked Article 50 and stopped the Brexit process.\n\nSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the first ministers of Scotland and Wales, Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford, \"joined forces to oppose this Tory government's damaging Brexit bill\".\n\nHe urged the prime minister to confirm that the legislation will not be passed unless consent was given by the Scottish Parliament.\n\nBut Mr Johnson said the Scottish Parliament had no role in approving the Brexit bill and suggested Mr Blackford \"have a word with other opposition parties\" to trigger a general election \"to settle the matter\".\n\nIn a statement responding to Mr Johnson's and Mr Corbyn's earlier meeting, Ms Swinson said it was \"more clear proof\" that the Labour leader wanted to deliver Brexit, after 19 Labour MPs supported the bill's second reading.\n\n\"It seems that Jeremy Corbyn has thrown Boris Johnson another lifeline this morning, as six white men met to discuss pushing through a Brexit deal which will wreck our country,\" she said.\n\nGeneral election\n\nTaoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar has confirmed he supports the proposal to grant the UK's request.\n\nHowever, Mr Johnson cannot simply call one, as prime ministers did before the passage of the 2011 Fixed-term Parliaments Act.\n\nUnder that act, he would need the backing of Parliament, and opposition MPs have previously ruled out holding one until the possibility of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October was ruled out altogether.\n\nSome Conservative MPs say the government should take the Labour Party up on its offer to come up with a timetable for the WAB that satisfies all sides.", "description": "The meeting comes after MPs rejected the government's timetable for Brexit legislation on Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/165BF/production/_109338519__95803512_boris_pa_corbyn_afp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
