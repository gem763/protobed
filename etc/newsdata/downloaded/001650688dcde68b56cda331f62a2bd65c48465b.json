In 1994, the board rejected a proposal to change it, and the Maryland House of Delegates did not vote earlier this year on a proposal that would have established a commission to look at alternate names.\n\nHighway workers appear to have gotten a jump on lawmakers. As the Cumberland Times-News reported Sunday, the Maryland State Highway Administration removed the signs, which on Interstate 68 read \u201cNegro Mountain Elev. 2,740 FT,\u201d earlier this year.\n\nLora Rakowski, acting director of the highway agency\u2019s office of communications, said in an email to the Cumberland newspaper that four signs were removed in the spring \u2014 two from I-68 and two from U.S. Alternate Route 40.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work with the Association for the Study of African American Life and History and the local community to better understand the interests of all stakeholders,\u201d the email said, according to the Times-News.\n\nMaryland\u2019s highway administration didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\n[Two offensive names that need to be changed]\n\nLynn Bowman, a retired professor at Allegany College of Maryland and member of the state\u2019s Commission on African American History and Culture who pushed for the change, said the road signs made some students uncomfortable. She called the signs a \u201cthrowback to 1950\u201d that showed \u201chow this area looks at African American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cMagically, it disappeared,\u201d she said of one sign. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how it disappeared. I\u2019m just glad it did.\n\nBowman said tales about Negro Mountain\u2019s name are better classified as \u201clegend\u201d than history. Two stories of the \u201cbrave servant\u201d who apparently died in battle offer different names for the servant \u2014 \u201cGoliath\u201d and \u201cNemesis\u201d \u2014 and his master. She also found the mountain referred to as \u201c[n-word] Mountain\u201d in \u201cThe Old Pike\u201d by Thomas B. Searight, a book published in 1894 that looks at the region\u2019s highways.\n\nWherever Negro Mountain\u2019s name came from, some legislators and residents have defended it.\n\nAfter the U.S. Board on Geographic Names declined to change the name in 1994, Maryland state archivist Edward Papenfuse said at the time that Negro Mountain \u201creflects an 18th century sensitivity to the important contribution African Americans made that is rarely so publicly demonstrated.\u201d\n\nMarguerite Doleman, co-founder of a black heritage museum in Hagerstown, Md., said at the time that the name had spurred interest in African American history.\n\n\u201cIt bothered me somewhat, but then it raised the question in my mind: What Negro?\u201d she said. \u201cIf it had been named Nemesis Mountain, I probably wouldn\u2019t have questioned it . . . Why lose your history?\u201d\n\nIn 1992, a Pennsylvania man wrote then-Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) to ask that the name be changed to \u201cBlack Hero Mountain.\u201d\n\n\u201cA mountain range was named \u2018Negro Mountains\u2019 supposedly in his honor,\u201d the letter said. \u201cIn my opinion, this was not an honor, to give such a generic name to honor a brave man is an insult.\u201d He added: \u201cThe name Negro Mountains says nothing, Black Hero Mountains says SOMETHING.\u201d\n\nPennsylvania Department of Transportation spokeswoman Tara Callahan-Henry said that state has no signage that references Negro Mountain.\n\nMaryland Del. Nick Mosby (D-Baltimore City), who introduced the proposal in March that would have established a renaming commission, said he planned to work with counterparts in Pennsylvania next year to rename the mountain ridge.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, it\u2019s unacceptable and does not reflect what Maryland as a state is today or how we are as a country,\u201d he said Monday.\n\nOn Negro Mountain, Bowman said, there\u2019s no downside to change.\n\n\u201cPeople in the Western Maryland area are concerned about money, tourism and economic health,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cI feel that if we combine that concern with ethics \u2014 that we need to be nice to people who come up here . . . maybe that would help.\u201d\n\nErin Cox contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018He should have died in a home of his own\u2019: Curbside memorial honors homeless man in downtown D.C.\n\n\u2018We thought it would be here forever\u2019: Maryland golf course to close after more than 60 years\n\nLetter critical of D.C. homeless encampments stirs controversy\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The signs bearing the mountain\u2019s controversial name came down earlier this year.", "authors": ["Justin Wm.
