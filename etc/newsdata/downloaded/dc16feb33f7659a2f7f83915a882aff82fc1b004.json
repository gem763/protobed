Fair play to Miley.\n\nBut in heaping praise on her new beau, Miley managed to claim that you don\u2019t need to be gay, you just haven\u2019t found the right man yet.\n\nSpeaking on her Instagram live, the 26-year-old said her \u2018hardcore feminist vibes\u2019 meant she wouldn\u2019t let anyone in (because believing in equal rights apparently means romance is off limits).\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThen she said: \u2018There are good men out there, guys. Don\u2019t give up. You don\u2019t have to be gay, there are good people with d***s out there, you\u2019ve just gotta find them. You gotta find a d*** that\u2019s not a d***.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I always thought I had to be gay because I thought all guys were evil, but it\u2019s not true. There are good people are out there that just happen to have d***s.\u2019\n\nOh, Miley. Miley, Miley, Miley.\n\nMiley is still pansexual when she is dating a man (Picture: Angie Simpson/Instagram)\n\nIn fairness to the star, she has since apologised, writing: \u2018I was talking s*** about sucky guys, but let me be clear, YOU don\u2019t CHOOSE your sexuality. You are born as you are. It has always been my priority to protect the LGBTQ community I am part of.\u2019\n\nBut she should know better. Miley identifies as pansexual \u2013 being attracted to people regardless of their sex or gender identity \u2013 and has dated women and men in the past, so she should be extra-wary of the damage that throwing around dated stereotypes can have.\n\nThe majority of LBTQ+ women will have an experience of being told that liking girls is \u2018just a phase\u2019 and that they\u2019re not gay, they just haven\u2019t found the right man yet. This usually comes from ignorant people who refuse to believe that sexuality is not a choice, and it can be incredibly damaging for a young person to hear that whatever they\u2019re feeling is just because they haven\u2019t found the \u2018right man\u2019. To hear that coming from an openly LGBTQ+ person who is now in a heterosexual relationship, who has a massive platform, can be just as hurtful.\n\nAs part of the LGBTQ+ community, Miley should know better (Picture: @TheHapaBlonde / BACKGRID)\n\nMiley also perpetuated the stereotype that lesbians/queer women are gay because they think men are evil. No, they\u2019re LBTQ+ because they are LBTQ+. Toting lesbians as man-hating feminists is a long-held stereotype that allows others to belittle and insult the community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m happy for Miley that she has found a good guy in Cody Simpson \u2013 she deserves happiness. And her sexuality isn\u2019t invalidated by her choice of partner; she is still pansexual when she is in a heterosexual relationship, which is often hard for people to understand.\n\nSpeaking to Vanity Fair, Miley said that \u2018a big part of my pride and identity is being a queer person\u2019, and in an interview with Elle while married to Liam, she said: \u2018I think it\u2019s very confusing to people that I\u2019m married. But my relationship is unique. And I don\u2019t know that I would ever publicly allow people in there because it\u2019s so complex, and modern, and new that I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a place where people would get it.\n\n\u2018I mean, do people really think that I\u2019m at home in a f***ing apron cooking dinner? I\u2019m in a hetero relationship, but I still am very sexually attracted to women.\u2019\n\nMiley has to explain her sexuality again and again, so she must be aware that lesbians and queer women are subject to constant ignorance about their sexualities. Sure, she didn\u2019t actually mean that people are free to choose their sexuality, and Miley has done a lot of work for the LGBTQ+ community, including setting up a foundation to help homeless LGBTQ+ youth. But even a joke, when spread to 100 million Instagram followers, can do damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnowing the ignorance and misinformation that is out there, Miley should know that whether she\u2019s in an anti-man mood or not, she shouldn\u2019t even jokingly perpetuate the idea that a) your sexuality is defined by your partner and b) your sexuality is something you can choose.\n\nIt\u2019s hard enough being an LGBTQ+ person in the face of bigots \u2013 we need everybody in the community to be an ally too.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
