The latter seemed to be the point, but Ms. Cooper simply testified a few hours later.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s already clear that the president grossly abused his office. Mr. Trump himself released a rough transcript of a call in which he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his family, as Mr. Zelensky sought military aid and a White House meeting. Republicans have offered no persuasive defense of the president\u2019s actions, because there is none.\n\nAD\n\nYet questions remain, and House committees are methodically looking for answers. Lawmakers lack a voluminous investigative record like independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr\u2019s 1998 report. They must do their own basic investigating, which is why it makes sense to hold some hearings behind closed doors. Investigators don\u2019t want witnesses to play for the cameras or dishonestly align their testimony with that of earlier witnesses. Classified material may be discussed. Republicans, in their incessant and fruitless investigations of Hillary Clinton and the 2012 Benghazi attacks, held many closed hearings \u2014 and insisted they were the most useful.\n\nMoreover, Republican legislators are present at all of these closed-door sessions and are free to pose questions. In fact, the rules allowed many of those who stormed Wednesday\u2019s testimony to enter the room in a civilized fashion if they so chose. The impression Republicans tried to convey, of Democrats cooking up an illegitimate indictment of the president while locking all others out of the room, is a partisan fantasy.\n\nAD\n\nMarginally more persuasive was a memo Senate Republicans released Thursday complaining that the full House had not formally voted on conducting an impeachment inquiry and that Mr. Trump is not allowed counsel in the room. Neither is required by the Constitution or House rules. But holding a vote would add legitimacy, and, more to the point, the sooner House investigators move from closed hearings to open ones, the better. Citizens should learn the scope and gravity of the president\u2019s misdeeds so they can form their own conclusions. House leaders should release transcripts of closed hearings, consistent with the protection of classified material, as soon as possible.\n\nAD\n\nOf course, all of this could happen sooner if the Trump administration were not stonewalling lawmakers\u2019 legitimate requests for information.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "The Republicans have no substantive defense of Trump, but their claims of unfairness also lack merit.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hdCC6GnGcNsKeXelfClWBXsR-XE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/X7JG54XWU4I6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
