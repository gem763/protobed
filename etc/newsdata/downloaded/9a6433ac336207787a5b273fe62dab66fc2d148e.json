He has lost about 30 pounds I think since I saw him, and he was thin at that point,\" Anderson told \"The View\" co-hosts Whoopi Goldberg, Abby Huntsman, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain.\n\nAnderson noted that because Assange \"wanted to look good\" for her, he wore two pairs of sweat pants in an effort to mask his weight loss.\n\n\"He feels like people won't fight for people if they\u2019re not resilient, and he is the most resilient person I\u2019ve ever met,\" she said.\n\nMORE: ANALYSIS: Making sense of the WikiLeaks CIA hacking expos\u00e9\n\nAssange skipped bail in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he was wanted on sexual assault allegations, which he denied. The charges were subsequently dropped, but Swedish authorities announced they were reopening their investigation in May.\n\nAfter seven years of hiding at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, Assange was arrested by United Kingdom authorities in April. Nearly one month later in May 1, Assange was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison at Southwark Crown Court in central London. He read a letter to the court apologizing to those who \"consider I have disrespected them,\" adding that he had struggled in difficult circumstances.\n\nFollowing the London arrest, federal U.S. prosecutors unsealed an indictment against him, charging him for allegedly conspiring with former intelligence officer Chelsea Manning in an effort to unlawfully gain access to a government computer in 2010. The breach is considered one of the largest thefts of classified government information in American history.\n\nAssange as well as his supporters have claimed he had no role in hacking Democratic documents or harvesting other government secrets, maintaining that he functioned as a journalist and publisher. The charges against Assange continue to raise concerns about the ripple effects it will have on press freedom.\n\nPHOTO: Pamela Anderson speaks out about Julian Assange on 'The View,' Sept. 6, 2019, in her first TV interview since visiting him in May. (Nicolette Cain/ABC) More\n\nAnderson told \"The View\" that everything that\u2019s happened to Assange thus far he warned her would happen.\n\n\"There was no surprises. It is devastating that people have fallen for this smear campaign, especially in America,\" she said.\n\n\"I almost feel like an outsider looking in, looking at how America has embraced all ... this propaganda,\" Anderson continued. \"It's really frustrating, but I just hope that he doesn't get extradited. I don't think he'll make it.\"\n\nMORE: Pamela Anderson defends Julian Assange as 'world's most innocent man'\n\nReferencing the recent prison suicide of registered sex offender and alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, Anderson said, \"I don't think you're protected in prison. Look at Epstein... there is a lot of danger surrounding his life.\"\n\nAfter Anderson's visit to Assange in May, she called him \"the world's most innocent man,\" telling reporters \"it's going to be a long fight,\" and \"he deserves our support.\"\n\nEvery episode of ABC's award-winning talk show \"The View\" is now available as a podcast!
