The only way is up for Australia\u2019s major population hubs according to industry experts.\n\nWhile development sites suitable for high-density living continue to be the overall preferred option for developers, metropolitan buyers are hungry for townhouse or terrace style properties according to Knight Frank\u2019s latest research.\n\nKnight Frank\u2019s Australian Residential Development Review reveals that in the 2018-19 financial year, high-density sites comprised 73.1 per cent of all residential development sites sold by volume, followed by low-density with a much smaller 20.9 per cent share.\n\nMORE: Packer heir\u2019s $16m impluse buy\n\nWhy millionaires are being priced out of these Aussie suburbs\n\n\u201cMedium-density or townhouse sites much suited to the downsizing population, and those priced out of the single dwelling market on the east coast, last recorded a 6 per cent share of Australian sites being sold for residential development in 2018-19,\u201d said Michelle Ciesielski, a Knight Frank partner and head of residential research.\n\n\u201cIn recent years, there has been substantially more land released for low-density in growth corridors of major cities. As a result, we\u2019ve seen the uptick in first-home buyers. However, there is still elevated demand for those looking for townhouse stock, especially at the top-end of the market,\u201d she said, adding that demand is outstripping supply.\n\n\u201cThe strict lending criteria for buyers has now been loosened, but access to traditional finance is still difficult for many local and offshore developers which has resulted in many projects put on hold,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAs a result of project marketing being postponed, and in many cases construction commencements, the pipeline of new apartments tapers back significantly over the next three years, potentially not supporting the population growth projected for major Australian cities.\u201d\n\nMORE: Australia\u2019s most-wanted homes\n\nInside Michael Jordan\u2019s mountain mansion\n\nChris Johnson, Urban Taskforce Australia\u2019s CEO said the shape of metropolitan skylines has already started to change and communities need to identify the changing great Australian dream.\n\n\u201cThere is a shift to a shared urban lifestyle in apartments with 30 per cent of Sydney homes being strata at the 2016 Census. Since then we have built a lot of apartments, but for the last year there has been a big slow down,\u201d he said.\n\nAs population levels in Sydney and Melbourne move toward the 5 million mark, Mr Johnson said Australia needs to follow the property path of other global cities.\n\n\u201cCities like London and New York have gone through similar tensions as they grow above 4 or 5 million people and low density means long commute times. So, while there will be times when communities react against high rise apartment living, I believe it is here to stay, especially in Sydney and a number of demographic groups prefer this more cosmopolitan way of living.\u201d", "description": "Substantial changes to how Australians want to live are set to remake our metropolitan areas into cities akin to New York and London.", "authors": ["Kirsten Craze"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/28123341/capi_2d01f2fe956b5042ba9ae6060fed191b_5d53f78d2309c9bb9b707d330090da95.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
