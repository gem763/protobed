He was convicted on three counts, including 'trafficking and/or attempted trafficking of testosterone'.\n\nHe was also found guilty of administering infusions of the supplement L-carnitine 'in excess of the applicable limit', and of 'tampering and/or attempted tampering with the NOP athletes' doping control process'.\n\nFarah, 36, who runs in the Chicago Marathon on Sunday, where he won last year, is now widely regarded as one of the world's all-time great distance runners. He was part of the NOP under Salazar's tutelage from 2011 to 2017, transforming into a four-time Olympic champion and six-time world champion in the 5,000m and 10,000m.\n\nFarah, a British national hero, has never tested positive for illegal drugs and split from Salazar by mutual consent in 2017.\n\nFarah was away in England at the time the testosterone was spotted in the apartment\n\nBut concerns over Salazar's suitability as a coach for Farah were persistent from 2015 onwards, when Salazar was first accused of doping and operating in grey areas in a joint investigation by the BBC's Panorama and journalists from ProPublica, an American media group.\n\nA former NOP staff member, Steve Magness, was a key whistleblower as USADA probed Salazar's activity from 2015 onwards. The arbitration panel that convicted Salazar accepted Magness's witness account that he saw Salazar 'with testosterone on the counter in the common area at a condo where some athletes of the NOP were staying in 2012 in Albuquerque, New Mexico'.\n\nCoupled with testimony from former NOP runner Kara Goucher, the panel established that Salazar 'had actual, physical possession of testosterone at the two training camps where the athletes of the NOP and Respondent were living together'. Salazar told Sportsmail this week that he was always 'careful' with his testosterone and would never leave it in a communal area.\n\nMagness has now provided Sportsmail with confirmation that the 'counter' in question was the kitchen counter in the two-bedroom flat. 'We [the NOP group] had several different apartments, and Alberto was staying in this one with Farah,' says Magness.\n\nMagness moved into Farah's room soon after Farah flew to England for a number of days for a race in Birmingham and says the drugs were clearly visible, and would have been seen by any other athletes visiting the apartment.\n\n'I saw the box of it,' he says. 'And I knew that was testosterone. Farah was sharing the flat with Alberto. In fact, some of [Farah's] stuff was still there when I stayed in his room when he went away for those few days to race.\n\n'We had another athlete using my room, so I took Farah's [for those days]. I moved in after Farah left and the testosterone was on the kitchen counter. It was there in plain sight the whole time I was there, and when I moved back to my own apartment, when Mo got back.'\n\nSalazar said he was 'careful' with testosterone and would not leave it in a communal area\n\nUSADA argued Salazar could not establish an 'acceptable justification' for his possession of testosterone 'because there was no legitimate basis to prescribe [Salazar] testosterone [at that time]'.\n\nUSADA further argued there was 'overwhelming evidence' Salazar was 'obsessed' with the testosterone levels of athletes at the NOP.\n\nMagness says Salazar later told him that the testosterone was for his personal use, for a heart condition. But even the presence of the drug in a flat's communal area would leave coaches or athletes susceptible to being accused of an anti-doping violation.\n\nUnder clause 2.6.1 of global anti-doping rules, possession of any prohibited substance, such as testosterone, is forbidden, even out-of-competition, for both athletes and coaches, and can be prosecuted.\n\nThe disciplinary panel ruled that there was 'no doubt from the evidence that he [Salazar] was indeed prescribed the testosterone for his personal use, whether or not his doctors followed appropriate medical guidelines'.\n\nYet between 2016 and 2018, on several occasions, before travelling, Salazar was administered 'an injection of testosterone' precisely so that he did not have to travel with the banned substance. Nevertheless, Salazar continued to file prescriptions for testosterone gel over the same period.\n\nSteve Magness, a former NOP staff member, says Salazar (pictured) later told him that the testosterone was for his personal use, for a heart condition\n\nFarah declined to answer questions about whether he saw testosterone in the flat, and if so whether he asked why it was there.\n\nSportsmail have established that after a race in Boston, USA, on February 4, 2012, Farah went to Albuquerque on February 5 and remained there until at least February 27, aside from taking a trip of a few days back to the UK for a race in Birmingham on February 19.\n\nMultiple sources aside from Magness have confirmed Farah and Salazar shared the apartment from the point Farah arrived at the camp until at least three weeks into February, when he returned to the flat after the Birmingham race.\n\nSalazar responded to Sportsmail that he did 'not have a specific memory of when Mo Farah roomed with me at any given time'. But Sportsmail has obtained an email from Salazar to a colleague during the period he was sharing with Farah, describing his accommodation on February 10, 2012 as 'the condo I'm sharing with Mo'.\n\nOn February 14, 2012, Sports Illustrated conducted an interview with Farah in the apartment he was sharing with Salazar, who is described as being in their kitchen, pouring a glass of wine. Tania Farah is cited as being in Portland, Oregon, on February 14 and Farah is quoted as saying: 'I won't see my wife and daughter for five weeks \u2026 That's the hardest part. It's difficult.'\n\nFarah's Twitter account on February 24, 2012 said he had been apart from his family for two months. He tweeted: 'I'm so happy to be with my wife and daughter again!! After 2 months!!! Shabba!!'\n\nThe extent to which Salazar left Farah exposed to possible damage to his reputation also brings into question the judgement of UK Athletics\n\nFarah's own autobiography from late 2012 says his wife Tania was in Albuquerque for one week in late February 2012, and 'didn't emerge from the hotel room the whole time she was in New Mexico' due to morning sickness.\n\nThe extent to which Salazar left Farah exposed to possible damage to his reputation also brings into question the judgement of UK Athletics (UKA), who in effect cleared Salazar as a 'fit and proper person' to be working with Farah in 2015. The UKA's performance oversight committee was established to investigate the NOP and found 'no reason for concern'.\n\nAs a result of Salazar's ban the Nike Oregon Project, which Farah was a part of for six years, has now been closed down by the sporting goods company. Nike wrote that 'unsubstantiated assertions' have become an unfair burden for current NOP athletes.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The extent to which Mo Farah's controversial former coach Alberto Salazar left the Briton exposed to potential embarrassment is revealed.", "authors": ["Nick Harris", "Edmund Willison For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/22/19637794-0-image-a-18_1570917212647.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
