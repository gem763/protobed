CCP, as the company is known, is the fourth homebuilder to raise capital this year. During Brazil\u2019s harshest recession in decades, homebuilders faced losses and did not access capital markets.\n\nThe offering signals renewed interest by investors in Brazilian real estate, as the country\u2019s interest rates fall to their lowest level ever.\n\nTecnisa raised $118 million in a share offering last July. Helbor Empreendimentos SA (HBOR3.SA) and Eztec Empreendimentos (EZTC3.SA) also sold shares this year.", "description": "Brazilian commercial real estate company Cyrela Commercial Properties raised 760 million reais ($190.4 million) in a share offering on Monday, the company said in a securities filing.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
