'Not exactly how I was looking to do it.'\n\nWalker was given a two-shot penalty for every putt she'd taken at French Lick, Louisiana\n\n'This is my first competitive round since 2011 or 2012,' Walker told Golfweek.\n\n'I knew there were rules changes. I just honestly didn't know them. Just plain and simple. My stupidity for not going over the rules changes.\n\n'I wasn't mad, I wasn't upset. I was just like, 'that's going to add a ton to my scores'. At that point what can you do?'", "description": "An American golfer was handed a whopping 58 penalty strokes over two rounds at this week's Senior LPGA Championship.", "authors": ["Reuters Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/18/19850232-0-image-a-50_1571333488967.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
