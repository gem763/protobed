Of course, Bitcoin crashed in the days that followed. This, he claims, is a sign that institutions \u201chave a good track record for the right directional trade\u201d.\n\nCOT Report: Bitcoin CME\n\nFutures Only Positions as of 2019-10-01\n\nCFTC Code: #133741 Asset managers/Institutional net long\n\n69.31 % long and 30.69% short (They were net short at the day of the bakkt launch.

Romano did not comment on that facet of the CME\u2019s COT report.\n\nBitcoin Bull Case Gains Traction\n\nAlthough Romano reminded his followers that institutions being net long isn\u2019t a conclusive sign that Bitcoin will head higher in the near future, there is evidence to suggest that cryptocurrencies may soon rebound.\n\nAs reported by NewsBTC previously, recent price action, especially the capitulation from $10,000 to $7,700, is structurally similar to what took place in November and December of 2018, during which Bitcoin fell from $6,000 to $3,000 in a short period of time. Crypto Hamster recently wrote:\n\n\u201cIt is too obvious to be true, but I have to admit that the drop from 6k to 3k and the following price action indeed looks very similar to what we have now.\u201d\n\nWhat he is implying is that Bitcoin may soon break to the upside, having bottomed in the recent flash crash.\n\nAlso, an analyst recently argued that Bitcoin\u2019s four-hour chart looks \u201cpromising\u201d, with there being an uptrend forming for both the Relative Strength Index and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) \u2014 a sign that they claim is an indication that \u201cwe may have a bottom\u201d.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "Despite the harrowing price drop seen in late September, institutions are expecting for the Bitcoin (BTC) price to soon head higher \u2014 at least for", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1274183125-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
