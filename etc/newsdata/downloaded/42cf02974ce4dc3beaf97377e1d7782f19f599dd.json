Let's review our favorite set of charts to see if it's now the time to go long.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of ABT, below, we can see that prices have successfully tested the rising 200-day moving average line several times this month.\n\nPrices have so far stalled or failed at the underside of the declining 50-day moving average line, but that is likely to change. The daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) has been steady the past four months, which tells me that existing longs have not become aggressive sellers. They have held their positions, even though prices have slipped from their highs. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator recently turned to the upside generating a cover shorts buy signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of ABT, below, we can see that prices have made a strong advance the past three years. The rising 40-week moving average line has been a great indicator of the trend and every test of the line has been a buying opportunity. ABT has been testing the rising 40-week line this month.\n\nThe OBV line has been firm to higher this year and helps to confirm the stock price strength. The MACD oscillator has been in a take-profits mode, but it has begun to narrow toward a potential new buy signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of ABT, below, we can see an uptrend. A trade at $83.91 will refresh the uptrend and open the way to the price target of $92.\n\nBottom line strategy: After several successful tests of the rising 200-day line and the 40-week line, ABT is ready to move higher again. Go long here and add on strength above $83.91. $92 is our first price target. $100 would be next.", "description": "The medical device and health care company is set to resume its long advance, with our first price target at $92 and next at $100....ABT", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Abbott Labs Has Concocted A Way To Advance Further", "The Medical Device", "Health Care Company Is Set To Resume Its Long Advance", "With Our First Price Target At", "Next At", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Eric Jhonsa", "Jim Cramer", "Jim Collins"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/f2124704-ba55-11e7-bc3b-7960d2d86339.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
