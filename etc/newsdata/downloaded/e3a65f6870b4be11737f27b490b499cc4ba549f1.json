Folt did not provide a reason for Swann\u2019s sudden resignation.\n\n\u201cLynn has been a leader on and off the field at USC for nearly five decades, and he will forever be a valued member of the Trojan family,\u201d Folt wrote in an email addressed to the USC community.\n\nThe USC athletic department has drawn widespread scrutiny in recent months after three coaches and senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel were implicated in a nationwide college admissions bribery scandal. The individuals were indicted on various charges for allegedly accepting bribes from wealthy parents to falsely present high school students as athletes to improve their chances at admittance to USC -- even though some of these students did not participate the sports they were \"recruited\" to play at USC.\n\nAt present, it\u2019s unclear if the admissions scandal was a direct factor in Swann\u2019s resignation. The 67-year-old former Pittsburgh Steelers star told the Los Angeles Times last March that he would not consider stepping down due to the bribery scandal. To date, he has not been implicated in any wrongdoing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFolt said Dave Robert, a special advisor at USC and the NCAA\u2019s vice chair of the committee on infractions, will serve as interim athletic director until the school can find a permanent replacement.\n\n\"Our Athletics Department puts our student-athletes first by pursuing excellence with integrity. We will build on the traditions and strengths of our exceptional athletics program,\" Folt added.\n\nDozens of parents, university officials and college coaches were charged in connection to the admissions scandal, including \u201cFuller House\u201d actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli and \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d actress Felicity Huffman. In some cases, the parents purportedly paid bribes to administrators alter SAT and ACT test results as their children sought admission to exclusive schools, including Yale and Stanford.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nA four-time Super Bowl champion, Swann also earned All-American honors while playing football as a USC undergrad.", "description": "The USC athletic department has drawn widespread scrutiny in recent months after three coaches and senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel were implicated in a nationwide college admissions bribery scandal.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/BrightCove/854081161001/201909/375/0/0/854081161001_6084757640001_6084756114001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
