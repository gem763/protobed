Does no one check what you're putting out on TV at 8.20am?!'\n\nAnd social media user Mark Greenleaf mocked the show's host, Ben Shephard, posting: '@benshephard just read Robbie Williams sleeve on the clip you showed this morning on gmb #strictlyafter9pm.'\n\nYesterday stunned viewers with a very rude error. The ITV chatshow showed a clip of Scunthorpe Steelworks, which had a sign that read: 'Welcome to British Steel Scunthorpe'.\n\nOh dear: The ITV chatshow showed a clip of Scunthorpe Steelworks, which had a sign that read: 'Welcome to British Steel Scunthorpe', but the GMB logo covered the 'S' leaving it reading: 'Welcome to British Steel c***horpe'\n\nYet due to a rather awkward formatting blunder, the GMB logo and time frame covered the 'S' in Scunthorpe, leaving the sign rudely reading: 'Welcome to British Steel c***horpe.'\n\nThe error didn't go unnoticed by eagle-eyed viewers at home who were left stunned over the crude sign.\n\nOne show watcher took to Twitter to share a photo of the gaffe, they captioned it: 'Oh dear. The @GMB logo and time were in an unfortunate position this morning @itvcalendar #gmb.'", "description": "Producers failed to censor the rude slogan as they played a clip to promote Tyson Fury's collaboration with the singer in the second blunder for Good Morning Britain in as many days.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline", "Olivia Wheeler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/09/20171302-0-image-a-21_1571992549550.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
