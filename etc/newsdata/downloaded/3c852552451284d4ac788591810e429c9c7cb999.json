Please tell me you have seen the Washington Post headline about U.S. special forces killing the leader of ISIS and referring to him as \u201cAustere Religious Scholar\u201d. I mean, if people don\u2019t believe in TDS at this point, I don\u2019t know what to say. Dude was leader of frickin\u2019 ISIS and he becomes an \u201cAustere Religious Scholar\u201d when Trump has him eliminated.\n\nThis is the number one thing trending on Twitter and WashPo is getting ROASTED. I attached my favorite parodies. How can anyone take the Washington Post seriously now? I mean, every time Trump\u2019s idiotic clown show reaches a low from which I think he cannot recover, the frickin\u2019 media outdoes him. Trump is a buffoon, but an American newspaper deliberately attempting to conceal and deceive with such an absurd characterization of evil incarnate beats all. I laughed out loud in real life when I saw it. Would be funnier if it were not so sinister at the same time. What has gone wrong in someone\u2019s soul that in order to deny credit to Trump, they characterize the leader of ISIS in such a bland tone?", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/74295047_985951801743112_8604144504183717888_n-e1572261576232.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
