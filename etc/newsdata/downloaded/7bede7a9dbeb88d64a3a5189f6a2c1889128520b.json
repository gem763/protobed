The United States\u2019 European allies, including Germany, largely share its criticisms of China, but not Trump\u2019s choice of tariffs to resolve the issues.\n\nMerkel said Germany is open for Chinese investment and she welcomes all Chinese companies to invest in the country. However, she added that Germany checks investments in certain strategic sectors and critical infrastructure.\n\nLi said that China hopes Germany will accept more Chinese companies and loosen export rules for certain goods.\n\nGermany, which traded almost 100 billion euros ($111 billion) in goods with China in the first half of 2019, holds the rotating EU presidency in 2020, when Merkel is planning an EU-China summit with a view to achieving a common European stance toward the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nReferring to an EU-China investment agreement, Merkel said that Germany was hoping \u201cthat we can perhaps finish this project\u201d during its EU presidency in the second half of next year.\n\nThat summit would aim to counter what Berlin sees as China\u2019s divide-and-rule approach to dealing with the European bloc, as Beijing promotes global infrastructure projects under its Belt and Road development initiative that has made it an influential player in poorer eastern EU countries, such as Hungary and Greece.\n\nSeveral companies signed agreements as Merkel and Li met, including Airbus (AIR.PA) - which came to an arrangement with China\u2019s AVIC Aircraft Corporation on assembling A320 planes in China - and German insurer Allianz (ALVG.DE), which wants to work more closely with the Bank of China.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nGerman engineering group Voith and CRRC said they wanted to cooperate on electric buses and Siemens signed a memorandum of understanding with China\u2019s State Power Investment Corporation Limited (SPIC) on developing gas turbines and cooperating on the use of hydrogen.\n\nAhead of her departure for China, prominent Hong Kong activists wrote to the chancellor urging her to be guided by her memories of life in dictatorial East Germany, and to be on her guard in her talks and business dealings with Beijing.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Wednesday withdrew an extradition bill that triggered months of often violent protests in the Chinese-ruled city, but some protesters said the move was not enough.", "description": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel said at the start of a visit to Beijing on Friday that the China-U.S. trade war was affecting the whole world and she hoped it would be resolved soon.", "authors": ["Andreas Rinke", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426891259&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8511V", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
