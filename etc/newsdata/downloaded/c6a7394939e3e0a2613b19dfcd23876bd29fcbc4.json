Others followed the hearse as it made its way from the airport, singing his songs and taking photos of the motorcade.\n\n\"He's an exceptional singer. He sings stories through his music,\" said Gilberto Martinez, watching the ceremony on a giant video screen outside the palace.\n\n\"If you don't know him, you haven't understood what love is, what falling out of love is, what Jose Jose wanted to show us with each one of his songs - above all with his voice,\" he said.\n\nJose Jose received several Grammy nominations, sold more than 250 million albums and was once courted by music legend Frank Sinatra, who wanted to sign him to his music label.\n\nA symphony orchestra, mariachi band and other artists honored Jose Jose's legacy by performing some of his hits, including \"The Sad One\" and \"The Ship of Oblivion.\"\n\nFans filed past the casket with two red roses and a gold-hued microphone placed on top, taking photos and throwing flowers on the crimson carpet.\n\n\"I feel it in my soul, a wound that will never (heal), it will always be there. He will leave, but he'll live on in our hearts,\" said Elsa Arias.\n\nBroadcaster Televisa reported the singer died after complications following treatment for pancreatic cancer. Jose Jose announced two years ago that he had a tumor in his pancreas that was being treated with chemotherapy.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the family led a funeral procession through the singer's former neighborhood before attending mass at the Basilica of Guadalupe.\n\nHe was buried at the French Pantheon cemetery, where some former presidents were also laid to rest.
