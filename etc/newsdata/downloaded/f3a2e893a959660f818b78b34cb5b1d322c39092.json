It also comes days before more than 30 state attorneys general are expected to announce a major antitrust investigation of Google, as The Washington Post first reported.\n\n\u201cWe have answered many questions on these issues over many years, in the United States as well as overseas, across many aspects of our business, so this is not new for us,\u201d wrote Kent Walker, Google\u2019s senior vice president of global affairs. \u201cThe DOJ has asked us to provide information about these past investigations, and we expect state attorneys general will ask similar questions. We have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment. The agency\u2019s top antitrust official, Makan Delrahim, signaled that such requests could be coming to tech giants as part of the department\u2019s review, which is also focused on social networking and e-commerce.\n\n\u201cWe might be issuing compulsory process on some third parties who may or may not need it, for whatever reason, to provide more information to us,\u201d he said last month.\n\nFor now, Google said that the Justice Department sought \u201cinformation and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations in the United States and elsewhere.\u201d That could give department lawyers a critical early trove of data to start their work.\n\nThe U.S. government\u2019s other antitrust agency, the Federal Trade Commission, previously investigated Google\u2019s search and advertising businesses for violations of antitrust law, but regulators there concluded their probe in 2013 without issuing major punishments against the tech giant.\n\nThe European Union, however, has been much tougher on Google: Antitrust authorities for the region have slapped the company with a total of $9 billion over the past three years for harming competition and consumers. E.U. officials have faulted Google for giving better billing in search results to its own offerings over rivals, for example, and using unfair practices in deploying its Android smartphone operating system.", "description": "Google said Friday it had received a legal demand for records from the Justice Department related to the tech giant's prior antitrust investigations, marking the company's first major acknowledgment that it's a subject of a federal competition probe.", "authors": ["Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter", "September At Pm", "Tony Romm Is A Technology Policy Reporter At The Washington Post.
