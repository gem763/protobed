A similar House resolution passed in 1984.\n\nSupport for the measure \u2014 particularly among some Democrats \u2014 grew after Turkey\u2019s recent offensive against the Kurds along the Turkish-Syrian border, which killed about 200 Kurds and displaced more than 200,000.\n\n\u201cGiven that the Turks are once again involved in ethnic cleansing the population \u2014 this time the Kurds who live along the Turkish-Syrian border \u2014 it seemed all the more appropriate to bring up a resolution about the Ottoman efforts to annihilate an entire people in the Armenian genocide,\u201d said resolution sponsor Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe vote on the bipartisan resolution came on the heels of House passage of economic sanctions against Turkey.\n\nTurkey crossed the border on Oct. 9 and began attacks across a broad swath of northern Syria after President Trump\u2019s announcement that U.S. forces would withdraw from the area. The United States had previously allied with Syrian Kurdish forces against Islamic State militants. The withdrawal drew swift condemnation from both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nMore than 40 states, including California, and several countries have recognized the genocide. But the Turkish government has refused to acknowledge it. And the U.S. government has stopped short of recognizing it by calling the deaths an \u201catrocity.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish government acknowledges that the killings occurred but rejects the use of the term \u201cgenocide\u201d to describe it, saying other countries should not pass legislation judging another nation\u2019s history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchiff, who represents many of the estimated 200,000 Armenians living in Los Angeles County, has pushed the government for decades to recognize the genocide but hasn\u2019t been able to overcome opposition from the Turkish government, a NATO ally.\n\nAlthough there are no plans to bring the companion resolution up for a vote in the Senate, Schiff said the 405-11 bipartisan vote sent a strong message. \u201cThe Turkish lobby has few friends and allies anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nSome lawmakers, including Rep. Michael C. Burgess (R-Texas) questioned why the House was taking time to debate a nonbinding resolution dealing with atrocities committed 100 years ago when Congress had a lot left to accomplish in scant days before the end of the year, including preventing the government from shutting down when its spending authority expires Nov. 21.\n\n\u201cIt remains unclear why we are urgently considering this resolution,\u201d he said.\n\nBut longtime supporter of the effort Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Northridge) said it was important for the United States to take a stance, even so long after the fact.\n\n\u201cIt is critical that we counteract Turkey\u2019s genocide denial because genocide denial is the last act of a genocide,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cFirst, you obliterate a people, then you seek to obliterate their memory, and finally you seek to obliterate the memory of the obliteration.\u201d\n\nSouthern California is home to the largest Armenian community outside Armenia, and each spring, thousands march on a day of remembrance.", "description": "The U.S. House passes a resolution to label as genocide the mass killings of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire, now modern-day Turkey.", "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Sarah D.
