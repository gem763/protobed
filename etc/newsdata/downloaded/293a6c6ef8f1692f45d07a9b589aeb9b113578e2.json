So they're high sugar, high calorie, carbonated soft drinks, for the most part,\u201d Normandin said. He spoke in an interview during Yahoo Finance\u2019s monthly Breakouts show.\n\nNormandin\u2019s venture Iris Nova serves as the parent company of the flagship beverage brand Dirty Lemon, which has sold more than 2 million bottles since inception in 2015, largely to millennial women. Celebrities including Cardi B, Karli Kloss and Kate Hudson have promoted the low-calorie, functionally focused lemon beverages, which are infused with wellness-intended ingredients like matcha, collagen, ginseng and chromium.\n\nNew York-based Iris Nova also owns a set of cashier-less brick & mortar retail locations \u2013 each called \u201cThe Drug Store\u201d \u2013 where passersby can purchase Dirty Lemon beverages simply by texting a customer service line. The company has also announced plans to invest $100 million over the next 3-5 years in up-and-coming beverage brands, which will then be added to the company\u2019s portfolio.\n\n\u2018Big disconnect\u2019\n\nTo be sure, incumbent leaders in the nonalcoholic beverage world have shaken up their own product lines to try and keep pace with consumer trends and tastes. And even as new players come into the space, Coca-Cola and Pepsi are still among the biggest players in the global non-alcoholic beverage space, generating about $32 billion and $64 billion, respectively, in total revenue during the last full fiscal year.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s June quarter results were driven by less sugary soft-drinks like Coke Zero Sugar, helping core soda volumes rise 4% during the quarter. And the company acquired British coffee chain Costa for $5.1 billion earlier this year \u2013 its largest brand acquisition in company history \u2013 in a move to expand the company\u2019s offerings beyond beverages.\n\nMeanwhile, PepsiCo\u2019s Frito-Lay snack segment helped drive its most recent quarterly earnings beat, along with sales in sparkling water and other healthier drink segments. Normandin acknowledged Pepsi\u2019s Bubly and LIFEWTR brands as \u201cboth very successful case studies in reacting to changing consumer demands.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the products, they are trying to shift. But these organizations are so large, and in many ways, they're dependent upon bottlers to produce their products,\u201d Normandin said. \u201cAnd I think that that's actually the big disconnect between the innovation that consumers want and the products that, you know, organizations like Coca-Cola want to be bringing to their consumer base.\u201d\n\nNormandin said a company like Coca-Cola is a business-to-business (B2B) enterprise, full of what he called \u201cinefficiencies\u201d due to there being so many points in the supply chain and distribution network.\n\n\u201cThey sell syrups to the bottlers and the bottlers put the bottles of the product that they produce onto trucks. The trucks bring the product to stores. The stores sell the product to consumers,\u201d Normandin said, \u201cSo the stores are actually the B2C (business-to-consumer) part of the equation. And there's a lot of inefficiency and a lot of people that need to, you know, touch that bottle before it gets to the consumer. We've cut out all of those middlemen, and we have a relationship direct with the consumer.\u201d\n\nDirty Lemon More\n\nIris Nova, by contrast, has what Normandin considers to be a closer customer relationship, given that consumers make purchases by texting the brand directly, with bottles then being shipped to them within one to two days. About 90% of Dirty Lemon orders are fulfilled via text \u2013 and Normandin said he plans to extend this ordering system to new brands coming onto the platform.\n\nIris Nova, incidentally, counts Coca-Cola as a major investor. The company led a $15 million seed funding round late last year into Normandin\u2019s enterprise, which also included participation from venture capitalist firms Greycroft and Imaginary Ventures.\u201d", "description": "Iris Nova, parent company to Dirty Lemon, wants to compete with incumbent beverage giants like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RTxdgpL.gK.HnCEKmODttQ--~B/aD0zMTE7dz00MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/13d61410-d0d1-11e9-becb-c2f85612b210", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
