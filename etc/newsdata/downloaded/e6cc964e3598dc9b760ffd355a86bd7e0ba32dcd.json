Beyond Meat (BYND) shares has surged from its $25 initial public offering to a high of $234.90 before settling down to a mere five times its IPO price. It closed at $122.05 on Tuesday.\n\nBut are the burgers any good? And which one is the best?\n\nYahoo Finance conducted a taste test of the two buzziest products \u2014 the Beyond Burger and the Impossible Burger \u2014 as well as patties that have been on the market longer, including the Whole Foods 365 store brand, the Boca and Amy\u2019s All American Veggie Burger.\n\nAnd the winner is... the Impossible, by a slim margin!\n\nIn this Wednesday, July 31, 2019 photo, an Impossible Whopper burger is photographed at a Burger King restaurant in Alameda, Calif. Burger King will soon offer its Impossible Whopper plant-based burger nationwide. The chain said the soy-based burger, made by Impossible Foods, will be available for a limited time at its 7,000 U.S. stores starting next week.

Overall, we felt that the Beyond-Impossible hype is justified.\n\nWe graded each burger on taste, texture and overall aesthetic, with a total possible score of 45. Impossible rated 33.5, Beyond 32.5, followed by 21 for Amy\u2019s, 14.5 for 365, and 12 for Boca.\n\nJulie Hyman is the co-anchor of On the Move on Yahoo Finance.\n\nFor more veggie burger coverage:\n\nWells Fargo warns of more competition for Beyond Meat\n\nBeyond Meat vs. Impossible Foods: Burger nutrition showdown\n\nNestl\u00e9-owned Sweet Earth launches plant-based Awesome Burger", "description": "Veggie burgers are buzzy, from the Impossible Whopper to Beyond Meat's stock surge.
