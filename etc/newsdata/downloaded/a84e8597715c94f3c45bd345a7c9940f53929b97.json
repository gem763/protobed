Support documents published yesterday in conjunction with Catalina\u2019s release highlight various issues related to broken plug-ins and incompatibility with 32-bit applications.\n\nIn particular, customers using older / legacy versions of Lightroom Classic or Photoshop (which use 32-bit licensing components and installers) definitely shouldn\u2019t upgrade, as Adobe says they\u2019re \u201cnot supported in any way for use on macOS Catalina.\u201d\n\nLightroom Classic has two issues: the tethering feature is unable to detect and capture from Nikon cameras, and the Lens Profile Creator is broken. Photoshop has several issues:\n\nChanging the file format doesn\u2019t change the file extension when you\u2019re saving an image\n\nPlug-ins downloaded from the web or installed by drag-and-drop can\u2019t be found\n\n32-bit droplets created with older versions of Photoshop won\u2019t work\n\nThe ExtendScript Toolkit and the Lens Profile Creator won\u2019t run\n\nThe support documents offer more details and some workarounds for the issues.\n\nThe macOS Catalina update has been causing problems for various software that\u2019s not yet equipped to handle the transition (like DJ software that relied on iTunes). It\u2019s generally good practice to wait before downloading the first version of a new operating system, and this time it doesn\u2019t hurt to be extra cautious.", "description": "Apple\u2019s macOS Catalina, released yesterday, has been causing issues for software unequipped to handle the changes.
