Nobody was hurt but several police cars were damaged.\n\n\u2013 Regional ministers: 10.5- 12 years jail \u2013\n\nFive former regional ministers were handed sentences ranging from 10 years and six months to 12 years.\n\nAmong them were Joaquim Forn, 55, who \u2014 as Catalan interior minister at the time \u2014 was responsible for regional policing and let the referendum go ahead.\n\nAlso in the dock were Josep Rull, 51, Raul Romeva, 48, Dolors Bassa, 60, and Jordi Turull, 53.\n\n\u2013 Three others: 60,000-euro fine \u2013\n\nThree other former regional ministers, who faced lesser charges, escaped jail time and were handed fines of around 60,000 euro ($66,000).\n\nSanti Vila, 46, resigned from the Catalan government on the eve of the independence declaration in late October 2017; Carles Mundo, 43, and Meritxell Borras, 55.", "description": "Madrid (AFP) \u2013 Twelve Catalan separatist leaders, most of them members of the former regional government, were convicted by Spain\u2019s Supreme", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/e2c0be_catalan-parliament-yellow-ribbons-symbolise-government-members-who-prosecuted-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
