Mr. Maguire is scheduled to appear before that committee i n an open hearing next week. Leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee said they expect him and Mr. Atkinson to brief them next week, too.\n\nMaybe there\u2019s not that much to the complaint; we can\u2019t know yet. What we do know is there is an important principle at stake: that Congress is supposed to have oversight \u2014 through confidential hearings \u2014 of complaints like this. There\u2019s a solid case to be made that Mr. Maguire, who has not invoked executive privilege as a reason for withholding the complaint, is ignoring the plain language of the law. While the lawyers battle over who is authorized to withhold what from whom, it\u2019s worth making two observations: first, that the intelligence community\u2019s watchdog \u2014 not some disgruntled denizen of the \u201cdeep state,\u201d but a man appointed by Mr. Trump \u2014 was alarmed enough that he thought it necessary to inform Congress.\n\nSecond, that the administration is doing whatever it can to keep the complaint from becoming known, even behind closed doors.\n\nMr. Trump mocked the whole episode on Twitter, asking, \u201cIs anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u2018heavily populated\u2019 call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\u201d That\u2019s a curious claim from a president who has gone to great lengths to hide from his own administration the details of his many conversations with President Vladimir Putin of Russia; who has casually revealed Israeli classified intelligence to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in the Oval Office; and whose defense secretary decided to quit after learning that Mr. Trump had told the president of Turkey over the phone that he was breaking with longstanding policy and withdrawing American troops from Syria.\n\nThree House committees are investigating whether Mr. Trump tried to get the Ukrainian government to investigate business dealings of the son of the former vice president and current presidential candidate Joseph Biden. They have asked for a transcript of a July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.", "description": "A whistle-blower\u2019s report has alarmed the intelligence agencies\u2019 watchdog.
