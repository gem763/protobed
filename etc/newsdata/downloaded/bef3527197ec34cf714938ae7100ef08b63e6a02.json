Dougie Hamilton also scored, and Sebastian Aho added an empty-net goal. James Reimer stopped 47 shots against the team that traded him last summer.\n\nAndrei Svechnikov and Haydn Fleury each had two assists as the Hurricanes matched the 4-0-0 start by the Hartford Whalers in 1995-96, before the club moved to Carolina.\n\nEvgenii Dadonov, Keith Yandle and MacKenzie Weegar scored for the Panthers. Aleksander Barkov had two assists.\n\nSergei Bobrovsky allowed four goals on 14 shots before being replaced by Sam Montembeault to start the second period. Montembeault finished with 19 saves.\n\nDzingel\u2019s second goal extended Carolina\u2019s lead to 5-0 at 1:31 of the second. The Panthers got on the board when Weegar flipped in a loose puck from in front at 3:51.\n\nYandle\u2019s power-play goal with 10:26 left in the third closed the Panthers to 5-2. Dadonov made it 5-3 on a power-play goal with 4:08 left.\n\nAho scored into an empty net with 1:19 remaining.\n\nThe Hurricanes got four goals in a span of less than 12 minutes during the first period.\n\nStaal gave them a 1-0 lead when he poked in the puck from in front after it deflected off a defenseman\u2019s skate at 6:48. Teravainen made it 2-0 when he deflected in a point shot from Fleury at 11:04.\n\nHamilton stretched the advantage to 3-0 when he wristed a pass from Svechnikov into the net at 15:37. Dzingel\u2019s power-play goal with 1:46 left in the first made it 4-0.\n\nNOTES: Yandle became the fifth player in NHL history and first born in the United States to play in 800 consecutive games. He joined Doug Jarvis (964), Garry Unger (914), Steve Larmer (884) and Andrew Cogliano (830). \u2026 Reimer, acquired by the Hurricanes from the Panthers on June 30, made his first start against his former team.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHurricanes: Visit the New York Islanders on Friday.\n\nPanthers: At the Buffalo Sabres on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: www.apnews.com/NHL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ryan Dzingel scored two goals and the Carolina Hurricanes beat the Florida Panthers 6-3 on Tuesday night for their fourth straight victory to begin the season, equaling the best start in franchise history.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Gereffi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/hurricanes_panthers_hockey_26537_c0-120-3000-1869_s1770x1032.jpg?b708dca1fb7a3a50b506b9f242e83820d31e3577", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
