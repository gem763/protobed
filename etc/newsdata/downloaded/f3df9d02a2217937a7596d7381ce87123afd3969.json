Probably not,\u201d he added. \u201cLet\u2019s let this play out a bit and see what happens.\u201d\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, a Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was less impressed.\n\n\u201cOther than giving Kurds a chance to leave so they don\u2019t get slaughtered, it doesn\u2019t sound like a change of any of the other dynamics I\u2019m concerned about,\u201d Rubio told reporters.\n\nBrett McGurk, the former special presidential envoy on fighting the Islamic State group, was also less than enthused.\n\nThe United States \u201cjust ratified Turkey\u2019s plan to effectively extend its border 30 kilometers (18 miles) into Syria with no ability to meaningfully influence facts on the ground,\u201d said McGurk, who quit in December, the first time Trump raised the prospect of pulling US troops out of Syria.\n\nDemocratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, issued a scathing statement saying Erdogan had \u201cgiven up nothing, and President Trump has given him everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s decision to reverse sanctions against Turkey for brutally attacking our Kurdish partners in exchange for a sham ceasefire seriously undermines the credibility of America\u2019s foreign policy and sends a dangerous message to our allies and adversaries alike that our word cannot be trusted,\u201d they said.\n\nNicholas Heras, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, took issue with Trump\u2019s characterization that it was a great day for the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\n\u201cThe United States just agreed to try to force the SDF to surrender its homeland along the Syrian-Turkish border to Turkey,\u201d Heras said.\n\n\u201cThis deal was made between President Trump and Erdogan, and for all intents and purposes, it cut the SDF out of the discussion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe terms of the deal are exactly what Turkey most desired, which is the forced expulsion of the SDF from its border,\u201d Heras added. \u201cErdogan could not have asked for more from Trump in this situation.\u201d\n\nHe expressed incredulity at Pence\u2019s assertion that the SDF could still be expected to wage operations against the Islamic State group, calling it \u201csurreal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Americans are putting their head in the sand if they expect the SDF to willingly abide by these terms,\u201d he said.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Turkey\u2019s agreement to suspend military operations against the Syrian Kurds may give President Donald Trump a reprieve from", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/b4c509_us-vice-president-mike-pence-brokered-agreement-turkey-suspend-its-offensive-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
