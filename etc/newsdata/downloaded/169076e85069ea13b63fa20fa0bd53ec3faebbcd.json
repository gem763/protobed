Lindsey Graham that the Australian government is assisting Attorney General William Barr\u2019s investigation of foreign interference in the 2016 election \u2014 but disputed the lawmaker\u2019s reference to an Australian diplomat involved in the Russia probe\u2019s origins.\n\nGraham on Wednesday had asked the prime ministers of Australia, Italy and Britain to continue to aid Barr in his inquiry, which critics say represents another effort by President Donald Trump to discredit the work of former special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the United States law enforcement and intelligence communities relied on foreign intelligence as part of their efforts to investigate and monitor the 2016 presidential election,\u201d the South Carolina Republican wrote in his letter to the leaders.\n\nGraham added that those efforts by American officials included \u201caccepting information from an Australian diplomat who was \u2026 directed to contact [Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George] Papadopoulos and relay information obtained from Papadopoulos regarding the campaign to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u201d\n\nIt has been reported that Papadopoulos had revealed to an Australian diplomat, believed to be Alexander Downer, details of his April 2016 conversations with Josef Mifsud, a London-based professor with ties to the Kremlin. Mifsud allegedly told Papadopoulos that Moscow had \u201cthousands of emails\u201d damaging to 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn a letter responding to Graham dated Wednesday, Ambassador Joe Hockey wrote that the Australian government \u201cis cooperating\u201d with Barr\u2019s inquiry and has \u201cbeen public about our willingness to cooperate.\u201d\n\nHockey added: \u201cIn your letter you made mention of the role of an Australian diplomat. We reject your characterisation of his role.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mueller\u2019s report, a foreign government official contacted the FBI in July 2016 about an encounter he had with Papadopoulos two months earlier, during which the then-Trump aide suggested the campaign \u201chad received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to\u201d Clinton.\n\nThat warning \u201cprompted the FBI on July 31, 2016, to open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump Campaign were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities,\u201d Mueller wrote.\n\nPapadopoulos was sentenced in September 2018 to 14 days in federal prison for making false statements to the FBI.\n\nThe New York Times reported Monday that Trump pushed Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison in a recent telephone call to help Barr gather information for the Justice Department's inquiry.", "description": "Australia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. confirmed to Sen.
