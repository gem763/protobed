FOREX-Dollar rebounds as safe-haven flows support\n\n* Dollar recovers after Tuesday's drop on impeachment\n\ninquiry\n\n* Pound falls on lingering political risks\n\n\n\n(Recasts with afternoon trading)\n\nBy Saqib Iqbal Ahmed\n\nNEW YORK, Sept 25 (Reuters) - The dollar rose across the\n\nboard on Wednesday, rebounding from the previous day's slide as\n\ninvestors nervous about an impeachment inquiry against U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump sought a safe haven, and as sterling fell\n\n1% on nagging uncertainty about Brexit and an election.\n\nTrump pressed Ukraine's president to investigate his leading\n\nDemocratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, in\n\ncoordination with the U.S. attorney general and Trump's personal\n\nlawyer, according to a summary of a telephone call released by\n\nthe administration. A day earlier, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi\n\nsaid the Democratic-led chamber was launching an official\n\nimpeachment inquiry, setting up a political showdown as Trump\n\ncampaigns for re-election in 2020.\n\nIncreased political risk have boosted the dollar's appeal\n\nfor investors seeking safety and stability, analysts said.\n\n\"There are political battles brewing on both sides of the\n\nAtlantic,\" said Juan Perez, senior currency trader at Tempus Inc\n\nin Washington.\n\n\"I think that overall the dollar's safe haven status is\n\nunderstood,\" he said.\n\nThe greenback is viewed as safe-haven due to its standing as\n\nthe world's reserve currency.\n\nThe dollar index , which measures the greenback\n\nagainst six major currencies, was up 0.7%, on pace for its\n\nbiggest daily rise in nearly three months. On Tuesday, the index\n\nslipped 0.3% to finish the session at 98.337.\n\nPart of the strength of the dollar's move on Wednesday was\n\nan unwinding of the knee-jerk investor reaction to the\n\nimpeachment inquiry news that sparked the previous day's slide,\n\nanalysts said.\n\nThe immediate reaction to sell the dollar was questionable,\n\nAdam Cole, a currency analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said.\n\n\"For a couple of reasons it's not a sell risk or sell dollar\n\nstory,\" he said, saying there was still a small chance that\n\nTrump would be impeached.\n\nThe British pound dropped more than 1% versus the dollar,\n\nceding gains made the previous day after the Supreme Court's\n\nruling against Prime Minister Boris Johnson, as investors priced\n\nin many more months of Brexit and general election risk.\n\nMeanwhile the euro , which has been dogged by worries\n\nabout the dismal state of the euro zone economy, shed 0.68% on\n\nWednesday.\n\n\n\nEuro vs U.S. dollar https://tmsnrt.rs/2mAPAvJ\n\nGraphic: World FX rates in 2019: http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n(Editing by Marguerita Choy and David Gregorio)\n\n", "description": "FOREX-Dollar rebounds as safe-haven flows support", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE0I024_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
