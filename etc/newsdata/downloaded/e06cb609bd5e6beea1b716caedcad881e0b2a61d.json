Further violent clashes broke out on Sunday after an unauthorized march went ahead, with riot police firing tear gas and water cannons and protesters launching petrol bombs.\n\nThe airport -- one of the busiest and most important commercial hubs in Asia -- has also been a key protest target\n\nIn August, protests inside the terminal forced operations to temporarily close and grounded hundreds of flights, while rallies outside blocked transport routes including the freeway leading to the airport. Dozens of countries have issued travel warnings for Hong Kong and the number of visitor arrivals fell substantially in the first half of August, according to official preliminary data.\n\nPassengers walk through barriers set up by protesters on a road near Hong Kong International Airport on September 1, 2019.

Transshipments and imports also declined by 19% and 15% year-on-year, respectively.\n\n\"In the past few months, there have been huge challenges to airport operations at times,\" C. K. Ng, the AA's executive director of Airport Operations, said in a statement. \"Thanks to the concerted efforts of the airport community, we managed to maintain normal operations and minimize impact on travelers.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Hong Kong's main carrier Cathay Pacific reported a decline in passenger and cargo numbers for August. Cathay Pacific and its regional sister airline Cathay Dragon carried a total of 2,906,954 passengers last month -- a drop of 11.3% compared to August 2018.\n\nCathay Pacific's Group Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam said August was an \"incredibly challenging month, both for Cathay Pacific and for Hong Kong.\"\n\n\"Overall tourist arrivals into the city were nearly half of what they usually are in what is normally a strong summer holiday month, and this has significantly affected the performance of our airlines,\" Lam said.\n\n\"Our inbound Hong Kong traffic was down 38% while outbound was down 12% year-on-year, and we don't anticipate September being any less difficult.\"\n\nThe months of political unrest have also affected business in the city. Union officials told CNN Business that restaurants are laying off workers and forcing them to take unpaid leave.\n\nMajor hotels are also asking workers to stay home -- in some cases, for no pay -- as business slows down.", "description": "Hong Kong saw a significant drop in air passenger numbers last month as political unrest in the Asian financial hub continues unabated.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190916104324-hk-airport-protester-plane-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
