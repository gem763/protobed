Granville and three other friends would take it in turns to drive to work at Eggborough power station.\n\nGranville re-joined R Sutcliffe in around 1968, remaining in the company until his retirement in 1990. He died, aged 65, in 2002.\n\n(Image: Irwin Mitchell /SWNS.COM)\n\nMavis developed symptoms including shortness of breath towards the end of last year. Following tests, she received her devastating diagnosis.\n\nShe added: \"It was a massive shock. Initially I couldn't think of how I could have been exposed to asbestos.\n\n\"It was only overtime that I realised it may have been from sorting Granville's clothes.\n\n\"I know that the doctors cannot do much but I am desperate to know how this happened.\n\n\"I would appreciate any help in getting answers regarding that issue. It would mean the world to me.\"\n\nShe has instructed specialist asbestos- related disease lawyers at Irwin Mitchell to investigate her illness and how she came into contact with the material \"before it's too late\".\n\nSuspecting her cancer could be linked to washing her late husband Granville's work clothes, Mavis' legal team is appealing for information from anyone who may have worked with him.\n\n(Image: Irwin Mitchell /SWNS.COM)\n\nLegal expert Hannah Robinson said: \"We are involved in many cases where individuals have been exposed to asbestos in industrial environments.\n\n\"But we are also seeing a number where people have come into direct contact with it through activities like washing clothes.\n\n\"Mavis's case appears to be one of those instances and it is yet another important reminder of the dangers that asbestos can pose.\n\n\"Whilst sadly medical professionals cannot do much for Mavis with regards to curing her cancer we are determined to help her gain answers before it's too late.\n\n\"We will be grateful to anyone who would be able to help us our efforts. Any information could prove vital.\"", "description": "Mavis Turton, 86, believes she has mesothelioma because of exposure to deadly dust on late husband Granville's overalls", "authors": ["Mark Branagan", "Image", "Irwin Mitchell", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20704187.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_ASBESTOS_CANCER_004.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
