(Afp Contributor#afp/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOblong and glassy, with the ability to glide across water without making a sound, the SeaBubble looks like a vehicle straight out of a James Bond flick.\n\nDespite resembling a Hollywood contrivance, the vehicle is actually a potentially new form of electric, urban transportation that could offer Parisians a watery alternative to hailing a taxi, driving a car or hopping on an electric scooter.\n\nKnown as a \u201cflying taxi,\u201d the boat can reach 20 miles per hour as it rises nearly 30 inches above the water using wing-like structures known as \u201chydrofoils\u201d that are designed to reduce drag. Inside, the vehicle holds up to four passengers, who face one another as if riding in a London taxi, according to Le Parisien, whose reporter snagged a ride inside the futuristic vehicle.\n\nDesigners say the taxi \u2014 which has been tested up and down the river Seine in the heart of Paris \u2014 can be hailed using a smartphone app and could be available for rides as early as next year, pending final licensing. The lithium battery-powered vehicle with butterfly doors already has captured the attention of social media.\n\n[A German startup just completed its first test of a new on-demand air taxi]\n\nLined by serene walking paths and quaint house boats squeezed against the riverbank, the Seine has always been a giant avenue flowing through Paris, trafficked by barges carrying commercial goods and river boats and cruise ships packed with tourists. Speaking to Reuters, SeaBubbles co-founder Alain Thebault said his vehicle is unique among this flow of aquatic traffic because it produces no sound and no pollution, making it an energy efficient alternative to gas-powered boats.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the future,\u201d he said.\n\nThebault envisions a fleet of SeaBubbles, in both Paris and other cities, that alleviate \u201cglobal gridlock\u201d created by billions of cars on the road. Even if those cars are powered by clean energies, the startup\u2019s website says, they\u2019ll still create a \u201cmassive traffic jam.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that the future of mobility will rise from the water,\u201d the sites adds.\n\nHow would it work?\n\nAfter ordering a ride, passengers would enter the vehicle with the help of a hostess and take their seats inside the SeaBubble, according to a description on the company\u2019s website, which notes that the interior was modeled after automobile interiors. After securing the doors and leaving the dock, the boat begins \u201cflying\u201d above the water at 7.5 miles per hour using its foils, \u201cpreventing any seasickness, sudden movements or rolling waves,\u201d the site claims.\n\nFoils, which have been around for decades and are not unlike small aircraft wings for the water, can be attached to a boat\u2019s hull, allowing the vehicle to skim above the water with less resistance and at higher speed.\n\n\u201cOnce the ride is over, the bubble slowly comes back to the water level to reach the dock, letting its passengers out and waiting for the next ones to board,\u201d the site adds.\n\n\n\nThe SeaBubble at a dock in Paris. (Francois Mori/AP)\n\nIn five years, SeaBubbles \u2014 which were conceived as being halfway between a boat and a plane \u2014 ambitiously plans for the company to be in 50 cities around the globe. Thebault told Le Parisien that his company is already fielding questions about the vehicle from luxury hotels and multiple municipalities, none of which were named.\n\nThe price: about $150,000 each, the paper reported.\n\nAn electric water taxi might someday compete with similar hybrid machines that are envisioned to crisscross cities from above. For several years now, a handful of companies have been jockeying to be the first to deliver an on-demand air taxi service.\n\nEarlier this year, Lilium, a Munich-based startup founded in 2015, unveiled an electric, five-seat air-taxi prototype that it claims uses the same amount of electricity as an electric car. Powered by 36 jet engines, but lacking a tail, rudder and propellers, the aircraft is designed to take-off and land vertically and has a range of about 185 miles in 60 minutes on a single charge. It completed a test flight earlier this year.\n\n[Zum, a ride-hailing company for kids, expands to six more U.S. cities, including D.C.]\n\nCompanies such as Uber, Airbus, Rolls-Royce Holdings (the aircraft engine manufacturer, not the luxury car brand owned by Germany\u2019s BMW) and Volocopter also are developing flying cars with a single hope: to bypass traffic-clogged streets below.\n\nUber plans to create a network of flying taxis in Dubai and the Dallas area by the year 2020. Kitty Hawk \u2014 a flying car startup created by Google co-founder Larry Page \u2014 is already offering test flights to potential customers.\n\nMORE READING:\n\nThe latest tool to help police develop empathy for the public: Virtual reality headsets\n\nHyundai\u2019s solution for navigating traffic-clogged cities: Mounting an electric scooter on your car\n\n\u2018Hey, Google!
