Apart from Pogba. It is unfair on him, unfair on the squad.\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\n\u201cIt is right that I hear Gary Neville complain about the chemistry that has been built. You could put any manager in right now; I\u2019m sorry, he will struggle.\"\n\nGiven the situation he has found himself in, Saha has backed Solskjaer's efforts to \"clean up\" the squad after offloading the likes of Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku in the summer.\n\nHe added: \u201cYou can say, alright he should not have allowed [Romelu] Lukaku and [Alexis] Sanchez to leave but the damage was already done because those guys didn\u2019t want to stay. So it is better to actually clean up in some ways, let\u2019s say, with respect.\n\n\u201cBut the actual power of the United history, the United set-up, has been fettered by three or four transfer windows. It was like a shotgun in two feet. They put themselves in that situation, not giving the platform to fight back.\u201d", "description": "Former Man Utd striker Louis Saha has branded it \"crazy\" to put the club in their current situation", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "The People", "Empics Sport"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13793706.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Draw-FIFA-Womens-World-Cup-France-2019-Paris-08-Dec-2018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
