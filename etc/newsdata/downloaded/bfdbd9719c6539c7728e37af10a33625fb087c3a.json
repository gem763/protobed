The report found that 40 of the 50 ASX50 firms used an underlying profit measure.\n\nThe change in the value of the underlying profit measure indicates that the companies are consistently calculating their measure of underlying profit through the business cycle, said Andrew Yates, the head of assurance and risk consulting at KPMG.\n\n\"What we really look for is the consistency with how companies apply their own non-statutory measure,\" Mr Yates said.\n\n\"As long as there's consistency in what they do from year to year then I think that doesn't negatively impact the transparency. It's when companies chop and change from year to year that we have an issue.\"\n\nFund managers argue the use of non-statutory measures has led to an increasingly confusing picture of what companies are really up to but company directors counter that they need to be able to use the metrics that best allow them to explain the performance at their company.\n\nProfit up at miners, energy companies\n\nMiners in the ASX50 recorded a profit before tax increase of 28 per cent to about $43 billion in the financial year, while energy companies in the index saw their profit jump 359 per cent to $7 billion, according to KPMG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe results were driven by higher commodity prices during the past financial year which helped the big miners and energy companies record increases in their statutory profit.\n\nBig-four banks ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac recorded a modest 2 per cent increase in statutory profit, to $44 billion.\n\nThe subdued result was due to the growing cost of compliance, increasing capital requirements and continuing margin pressure, the report stated.\n\nThe most common types of key audit matters listed in annual reports \u2013 the issues that takes up the most time and effort of auditors \u2013 continues to be around taxation and goodwill.\n\n\"When we look at impairment of goodwill, you're really looking at the book value of your goodwill and comparing that to the fair value assessment of goodwill,\" said Eileen Hoggett, the head of audit of KPMG.\n\n\"So there's a lot of assumptions that are used in determining that value. That's why it's always, and will continue to be, an area of focus.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMs Hoggett said there had been significant movement across the ASX50 in terms of key audit matters.\n\n\"Half of the ASX50 either had a change to the number of KAMs or the type of KAMs, and I think that's actually a good thing,\" she said.\n\n\"It shows these audit reports are dynamic, it's also reflecting the proportionality of focus and changes in the underlying business.\"\n\nEmail the reporter at edmundtadros@afr.com.au", "description": "Strong results at mining giants BHP and Rio Tinto have helped drive profits at Australia's 50 largest listed companies up by 15 per cent to $138 billion over the past financial year, according to a report by big-four consulting firm KPMG.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.4911%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1629%2C$x_35%2C$y_533/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/efc3316e6722f54bda11ca329c4bfa596374c79f", "published_at": "2018-10-23"}
