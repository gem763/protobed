To do so, we enlisted master carver and baker extraordinaire Arlene Lott, who created these incredibly artful pies for us, to come up with three perfectly patriotic pumpkin carving DIYs that anyone can execute. Below you'll find Arlene's stencils and instructions for each of these ghoulish gourds \u2014 but first, here's what she wants you to to keep in mind before you get started:\n\nThose pumpkin carving tools that look like they're for kids? Yeah, they're the real deal. Their serrated, dull-edged blades work better on cutting through pumpkin flesh than my sharpest knives, and that big, scrapey spoon does a perfect job of removing the flesh and seeds. So grab a set. They really make this project much safer and easier.\n\nLinoleum carving tools work great as well, and are reasonably priced. They're especially helpful for removing flesh without cutting all the way through your pumpkin, so when you get a little more skilled at carving, opt for these on top of your basic set.\n\nCut your pumpkins open at the bottom instead of the top. This makes it way easier to light the candle and then lower the pumpkin over it rather than having the flame creep all the way up your arm when you try to light it from above. And if you don't want to worry about IRL flames, skip the candles altogether and go with a little push button LED light that can be found at the hardware store.\n\nIf you want to carve your pumpkin in advance of Halloween and keep it looking good, the general rule of practice is to soak your pumpkin in a solution of bleach and water after carving. To make this mixture,add 1 tbsp of bleach to 3 litres of water and dunk that pumpkin for 2-3 minutes. This should help delay decay and mould for a week to 10 days. You're going to want to do this whole process outside or let it dry in your laundry basin or tub. Best to not let the bleach solution get on any fabric or surface you care about.\n\nRemember: mistakes are fixable! Toothpicks and floral wire will help you out of most jams if you break off a piece mistakenly. So don't stress, this only a jack-o-lantern after all.\n\nNow that you're ready to start, here's what you need to do:\n\nClean the surface of your pumpkin to remove any dirt or grime. Cut out the bottom of your pumpkin and scrape out the guts. Save the seeds to roast if you're feeling it \u2014 or go buy some later, we won't judge! On the computer, size your stencil template to fit your pumpkin and print it out. Tape your stencil to the surface of your pumpkin. It may be difficult to get a flat piece of paper to take the curves of a pumpkin, so trim off the excess and cut some release cuts into the paper so the template lays flatter. Poke holes through the template into the flesh of the pumpkin with a skewer, or other sharp tool. Then it's as simple as connecting the dots!\n\nCreature of Canadiana\n\nDifficulty level: You got this!\n\nTime to complete: 20 minutes\n\nThis red and white creature is easy to execute \u2014 it's just a whack of straight lines. Once you've carved out your pattern, you're going to light this frightening beast with a red LED bike light, which can be found at stores like Walmart or Canadian Tire. Throw that inside your pumpkin and watch all your neighbours say \"Oh that's so clever!\" as they send their kids up for candy.\n\nBOO! (sorry)\n\nDifficulty level: Total show-off\n\nTime to complete: 45 minutes\n\nIf you happen to love typography, this template makes it easy for you to subtly nod to your patriotism.\n\nWhen you're ready, start with the big letters first and use your smaller serrated tool to carve. For the \"(sorry)\" text, cut along the dotted lines with a sharp blade \u2014 a utility knife or sharp paring knife will do the trick. You want to cut into the flesh very lightly, so as not to pierce all the way through.Then, using your linoleum cutters, gouge out the flesh and scrape it away until you're left with a thin layer of pumpkin. This will glow when the light is placed inside, and people will think you're a genius.\n\nDamned beaver!\n\nDifficulty level: Buckle up\n\nTime to complete: About an hour\n\nWhat happens when Canada's furry mascot starts chompin' on necks instead of wood? This vampiric pumpkin, of course!\n\nWith this one, start with tiny details in the middle \u2014 the eyes, the lines in the tail \u2014 and then work up to the big open areas. This way, you have as much surface area holding your pumpkin together while you're working on the trickiest parts. You might also find it helpful to place a hand inside the pumpkin to support it while you clean up the edges.\n\nDownload all three stencils here.
