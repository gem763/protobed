Mattis on Thursday responded to President Trump, his former boss, after Mr. Trump reportedly called him the \u201cworld\u2019s most overrated general\u201d in a meeting with congressional leaders earlier this week.\n\nSpeaking at the 74th Annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York, Gen. Mattis said he welcomed the label.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just an overrated general. I am the greatest \u2014 the world\u2019s most overrated,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m honored to be considered that by Donald Trump because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress. So I guess I\u2019m the Meryl Streep of generals, and frankly that sounds pretty good to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you do have to admit that between me and Meryl, at least we\u2019ve had some victories,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the rating didn\u2019t bother him.\n\n\u201cOf course not \u2014 I earned my spurs on the battlefield. \u2026 Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor,\u201d he said, a reference to Mr. Trump\u2019s medical deferment during the Vietnam War.\n\nThe dinner is a charity function where speakers frequently roast public figures.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer said he pointed out to Mr. Trump in a White House meeting this week that Gen. Mattis had warned of the consequences resulting from the administration\u2019s move to pull U.S. forces out of Northern Syria, apparently prompting the retort and rating of Gen. Mattis from the president.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
