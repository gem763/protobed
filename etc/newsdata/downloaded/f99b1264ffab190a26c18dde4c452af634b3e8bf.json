What most people may forget is that subsequent terrorist threats \u2014 that theaters showing the film would be attacked \u2014 persuaded many cinema operators to refuse to show the film, and for a while, Sony canceled the film\u2019s theatrical release.\n\nThe good news is that eventually, Sony gave the film a limited release and made it an online digital rental. But there was this weird sense of paralysis back in December 2014. A hostile foreign regime had, at least for a while, dictated that an American movie studio couldn\u2019t release a film, and they appeared to be getting away with it. Everyone in Hollywood and Washington seemed to just stand around and say, \u201cwow, that\u2019s awful.\u201d\n\nEventually, the U.S. government started treating it for what it was: a hostile state attacking American citizens for exercising their freedom of speech. The FBI launched a full investigation, announced criminal charges; the Obama administration denounced the attack and announced new sanctions; and about a month later, the Internet went down for about ten hours in North Korea. The U.S. government never claimed responsibility, so I suppose technically it could be just a weird coincidence that North Korea lost all Internet hours after President Obama declared that the United States would launch a \u201cproportional response\u201d to \u201ccyber-vandalism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt took a little while, but eventually there was a unified American pushback that declared, \u201cno foreign regime gets to tell Americans what they can and can\u2019t say.\u201d\n\nThe current moment with China requires the same response. But the early returns from the NBA \u2014 and ESPN! \u2014 are not encouraging, to say nothing of the administration\u2019s relative silence on the matter (or the Hong Kong protests) in general. North Korea is comparably weak and isolated and doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends in the United States. China is comparably strong, and a lot of Americans feel like their financial fortunes are tied to keeping the government in Beijing happy.\n\nWe are about to see who really decides what Americans can or can\u2019t say.", "description": "One more point I've been meaning to add: the parallel to when North Korea tried to strong-arm Sony Pictures into canceling its film, 'The Interview.'", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "Rich Lowry", "Kevin D.
