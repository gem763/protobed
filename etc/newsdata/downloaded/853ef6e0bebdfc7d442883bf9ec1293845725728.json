Flynn, the onetime national security adviser. From the perspective of criminal law, the resulting questions, which pertain mainly to the president\u2019s intent in making the request, are inescapable. From the perspective of the decidedly political act of impeachment, they are irrelevant. The purpose of impeachment is not punitive. It is prophylactic.\n\nCriminal law looks backward toward offenses committed. The object of impeachment is not to exact vengeance. It is to protect the public against future acts of recklessness or abuse. Consequently, the issue in deciding whether Mr. Trump is liable to impeachment is less what happened in the Oval Office between him and Mr. Comey than what those events say about what will happen in similar situations in the future. That is not a case for casual impeachment. On the contrary, since it is harder to predict future acts than to prove what has already occurred, such a standard may be harder to meet.\n\nOur tendency to read the impeachment power in an overly legalistic way, which is ratified by 230 years of excessive timidity about its use, obscures the political rather than juridical nature of the device. The Constitution applies presidential impeachment to \u201cTreason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d The famous latter phrase does not refer to offenses like burglary on the one hand or loitering on the other. If it did, impeachment would be available for casual transgressions, which no framer of the Constitution intended.\n\nThe phrase dates in American constitutionalism to the founder George Mason\u2019s proposal to make the president liable to impeachment not just for treason and bribery \u2014 the original formulation at the Constitutional Convention \u2014 but also for what he called \u201cmaladministration.\u201d His fellow framer James Madison objected to the vagueness of the term, so Mason substituted \u201chigh Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d That phrase, in turn, is traceable to the British legal commentator William Blackstone, a contemporary who was revered in colonial America, who applied it to the \u201cmal-administration of high officers,\u201d among other things.", "description": "The framers cared more about a president\u2019s \u201cmaladministration\u201d and potential future abuses than they did about his past crimes and misdemeanors.", "authors": ["Greg Weiner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/18/opinion/18weinerWeb/18weinerWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2017-05-18"}
