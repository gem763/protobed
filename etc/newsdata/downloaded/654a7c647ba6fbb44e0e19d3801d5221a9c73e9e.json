Elizabeth Warren to historical icon Frederick Douglass -- over the way they posed for photos.\n\nWaPo reporter Hannah Natanson began her piece by pointing out that 19th century abolitionist Douglass (1818-1895) \"appears alone in almost every photograph, staring down the camera in isolated, thoughtful splendor,\" while Warren \"features today in countless iPhone photos and Instagram feeds, her arm around voter after voter, always bearing the same wide grin.\"\n\n\"The two are separated by race, gender and more than 100 years of history that forged an America that would probably be unrecognizable to Douglass,\" Nathanson wrote. \"Still, experts say, their use of photography collapses the distance: Douglass sat for scores of pictures to normalize the idea of black excellence and equality, and Warren\u2019s thousands of selfies with supporters could do the same for a female president.\"\n\nWARREN GETS STUMPED BY COLBERT WHEN PRESSED ON MIDDLE-CLASS TAX HIKES TO FUND MEDICARE-FOR-ALL\n\nThe piece goes on to cite professors who support the comparison presented by Natanson that both Warren and Douglass were \"smashing stereotypes.\"\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s presenting a public image of herself as somebody who is presidential,\u201d Columbia University professor Alexander Alberro said. \u201cWhat Douglass tried to do was to create a public persona in the face of the negative type of image of African Americans at the time \u2026 so I think the comparison is really good.\u201d\n\nLouisiana State University professor Nichole Bauer suggested that even if Warren goes on to defeat in 2020, her \"million selfies are just a little bit more of a crack in that glass ceiling.\u201d\n\nStill, the comparison raised many eyebrows on social media.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJournalist Jordan Chariton went even further, accusing The Washington Post of \"propping up\" Warren and \"defeating\" her progressive opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\n\n\"Just when you think @washingtonpost can't get anymore absurd in their campaign to prop up @ewarren (and defeat @BernieSanders), they are now comparing Warren taking selfies with people to......Frederick Douglass,\" Chariton tweeted.", "description": "An article\u00a0in the Washington Post\u00a0this week was widely mocked for comparing Democratic\u00a02020 presidential hopeful Sen.
