Collin Green wrote in a letter to the troops. \"Some of our subordinate formations have failed to maintain good order and discipline and as a result and for good reason, our (Naval Special Warfare) culture is being questioned.\"\n\nThere was cocaine abuse in a SEAL team based in Virginia. Two SEALs were accused of killing a U.S. soldier in a hazing in North Africa. Another SEAL allegedly raped an American female service member during a drunken party in Iraq.\n\nAnd then there was the case of Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher.\n\nFighting Islamic State in Iraq\n\nA combat veteran with the nickname Blade \u2014 who said he craved combat and the chance to \"kill as many people as possible,\" according to The New York Times \u2014 Gallagher was accused by members of his platoon of battlefield atrocities in Iraq while fighting the Islamic State terrorist group in 2017.\n\nThe allegations included shooting Iraqi civilians from a sniper's nest, firing indiscriminately into neighborhoods with a heavy machine gun, and using a custom-made knife to stab a teenage captive to death before posing with the corpse for a photograph.\n\nSpecial Operations Chief Edward Gallagher walks out of military court in San Diego on July 2, 2019.

Gallagher, who had become the darling of right-wing commentators, was acquitted in July on all charges except the one dealing with posing with a dead body.\n\nAccording to The Times report last week, after Green began worrying about an anti-authority \"Gallagher effect\" infecting his elite force, an Instagram account belonging to Gallagher and his wife offered T-shirts with the phrase \"Gallagher effect\" and decried Green and another top leader as \"a bunch of morons.\" Plans were drawn up to force Gallagher out of the SEALs based on new evidence of misconduct after unauthorized weapons, stolen equipment and illegal drugs were found in Gallagher's home and a work locker.\n\nThen President Donald Trump entered the picture.\n\n'Train our boys to be killing machines'\n\nThe commander in chief, who has advocated torture and taken a keen interest in pardoning troops convicted of war crimes, complained in a tweet this month that \"we train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!\"\n\nHe followed Gallagher's case, even discussing it with senior Navy officials. According to The Times, the Navy was faced with a dilemma: It could kick Gallagher out of the SEALs to help restore good order and discipline, but risk a reversal by Trump that would effectively emasculate SEAL leadership. So no action has been taken. And what Navy leaders most feared has likely come to pass: They've been shown powerless as the Gallagher effect undermines the unit's ethical code that \"uncompromising integrity is my standard. My character and honor are steadfast. My word is my bond.\"\n\nLast week, former Navy SEAL and retired Adm. William McRaven \u2014 the highly respected architect of the bin Laden raid \u2014 reflected in a column about America's military ethos.\n\n\"The Greatest Generation went to war because it believed that we were the good guys,\" he wrote. \"We are the most powerful nation ... because we try to be the good guys.\"\n\nBut with Gallaghers in the ranks and a president in their corner, is the United States still the good guys?\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.
