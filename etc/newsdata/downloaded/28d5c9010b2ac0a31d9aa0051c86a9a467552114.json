But today, Verge readers can save $100 on a refurbished Google Pixel 3A (64GB, any color), bringing the price down to an even more digestible $299.99.\n\nIf a 5.5-inch screen isn\u2019t big enough for you, we\u2019ve also secured a good deal on the Pixel 3A XL with Daily Steals. This phone has a 6-inch display, is available with 64GB of storage in all color variations, and costs $339.99. That\u2019s $140 off of the brand-new cost.\n\nIf you want to take advantage of this deal, you can save $100 on the Pixel 3A at Daily Steals by pasting the offer code VERGEP3A in at checkout. To save $140 on the Pixel 3A XL, paste VERGEP3AXL at checkout.\n\nBoth phones are in \u201cGrade A\u201d condition at Daily Steals, which, according to its site, says you can expect it to arrive in \u201cexcellent aesthetic condition,\u201d with small or no signs of wear. Also, your purchase includes six months of warranty coverage from Google. You can also purchase additional coverage through Daily Steals.\n\nMy colleague Dieter Bohn discuss the Pixel 3A and 3A XL at length in the video review above, but here are a few takeaways:\n\nEach has a vibrant, contrast-rich OLED screen and really good camera performance that essentially matches what the Pixel 3 offers for far less money. These phones are compatible with Android 10, the latest major update that recently launched, and they will be supported with future software versions for a few years. They also work with every US carrier and MVNO, so you won\u2019t be stuck if you want to change carriers or travel internationally.", "description": "If you\u2019re looking for your next phone, refurbished Pixel 3A and Pixel 3A XL phones are $100 and $140 off, respectively, for Verge readers. These are almost as good as the Pixel 3 in a few key ways, but they cost much less.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fLS9Mo8aeh_44hYw7SUaxAIVFPo=/0x127:2040x1195/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16213702/vpavic_190503_3404_0042.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
