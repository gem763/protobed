Then, country superstar, Kacey Musgraves stopped by.\n\nAnd now, business is booming.\n\nGabriel Olsen/Getty Images\n\nThe Grammy-Award winning singer was in Los Angeles on her \u201cOh, What a World\u201d tour earlier this week for two sold-out concerts at the Greek Theater, and it all started when Musgraves and her sister needed to quickly develop some film.\n\n\u201cMy sister randomly found this place on Beverly Blvd in Korea Town called Tom\u2019s One Hour Photo & Lab. It\u2019s one of those rare mom-&-pop gems\u2026\u201d Musgraves wrote in an Instagram caption underneath a photo of the singer posing in front of a black-and-white floral background.\n\nTom Tuong opened the shop on Beverly Boulevard nearly three decades ago and specialized in developing film, taking passport photos and photo restoration. In Musgraves\u2019 Instagram post, she said that, according to Tuong, the shop was busy when it first opened in the 1990s but that business \u201chas slowed way down since the digital wave.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe does same day services and at a reasonable cost,\u201d according to Michelle S., a reviewer on Yelp. \u201cMany of my family members go to him for his services.\u201d\n\nHe also offered nostalgic glamour portraits where customers can choose between 30 unique hand-made pull-down backdrops -- and that's what caught Musgraves' eye.\n\n\u201cPick the backdrop of ur dreams,\u201d she wrote, showing off the displays.\n\nPick the backdrop of ur dreams \u2728\n\n\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, please watch mine and my sister\u2019s stories to learn more about this sweet, hard-working person and his rad / very nostalgic shop we stumbled across in LA:\n\n\n\nTom\u2019s One Hour Photo\n\n4158 Beverly Blvd\n\nLos Angeles, CA pic.twitter.com/UzggMy8ThJ \u2014 K A C E Y M U S G R A V E S (@KaceyMusgraves) August 28, 2019\n\nIn the 1990s, glamour shots studios could be found in many malls and were especially popular for special occasions, like graduations or the prom. But as the New York Times wrote earlier this year, many of those shops disappeared with the rise of digital photos.\n\nThe country singer\u2019s post has garnered over 100,000 likes on both Twitter and Instagram with over 17,000 retweets.\n\nMusgraves and her sister even created an Instagram fan page for Tom: @TomsOneHourPhotoLab, which now has over 40,000 followers and posts of some of their portraits taken by Tom.\n\nTom may never even know about the insta we made for him (@tomsonehourphotolab) but I hope you will make a special trip to Beverly Blvd to get your film developed or portrait/passport photo taken \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc94 We have to save dying businesses like this.

We\u2019ve been getting calls from people who didn\u2019t even know that photo labs existed, so they were excited.\u201d\n\nTisha, who has helped her dad at the shop when she was younger in high school, shared her excitement for her dad\u2019s newfound fame in an Instagram story post earlier this week calling her dad a \u201clegend.\u201d\n\nThe insta we made to try and help get the word out about this charming little small business: @tomsonehourphotolab pic.twitter.com/p3NH381CYH \u2014 K A C E Y M U S G R A V E S (@KaceyMusgraves) August 28, 2019\n\n\u201cHis story is a classic immigration story,\u201d she told ABC News. \u201cHe immigrated from Vietnam and did several odd jobs before photography. It was a situation where he learned the ropes.\u201d\n\nAt a recent concert in New Mexico, Musgraves shared her story about Tom on stage.\n\n\u201cOur country is built on the backbone of these small businesses,\" she told her fans. \"My parents are small business owners\u2026 So I know what it\u2019s like.\u201d\n\nAs for Tuong, his daughter Tisha said he\u2019s thrilled about the attention his small shop has received over the past few days.\n\n\u201cHe loves people,\u201d she said.", "description": "A photo shop in Los Angeles is being revived after Kacey Musgraves stopped by.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/kacey-musgraves-01-gty-jef-190830_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
