No-one was injured.", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 Strife-torn Hong Kong is sliding towards becoming a police state, US senator Josh Hawley warned Monday, as the financial hub", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/b40f7c_us-republican-senator-missouri-josh-hawley-takes-questions-in-hong-kong-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
