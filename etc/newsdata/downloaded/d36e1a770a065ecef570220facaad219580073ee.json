But what about the things you should avoid. The Selling Houses Australia team share their views on what sellers should not do when it comes time to sell.\n\nMORE NEWS: Rare seaside estate hits market\n\nHot spots for investors revealed\n\nThe big house with its own \u2018mini-me\u2019 house\n\nInterior designer Shaynna Blaze\n\n1. Don\u2019t think just because you love your home everyone else will. No one wants to buy another person\u2019s life or memories so take your personal life out of your home.\n\n2. Don\u2019t strip the house bare. There is de-cluttering and there is emptying a room. Furniture in a room will give potential buyers a sense of balance and understanding of what can fit in the space.\n\n3. Buyers don\u2019t want to imagine what the place will look like once it is fixed up so don\u2019t have the attitude \u201cI thought I would leave it and let the new owners put their spin on it\u2019\u2019. I have heard this so many times and then a house will sit on the market while the well-staged houses are snapped up.\n\n4. Don\u2019t ignore the wriggly lock, the stuck door or the carpet coming loose that you trip up every day. Buyers notice all the fine details and will instantly think, \u201cwhat are the hidden problems I have to deal with?\u2019\u2019\n\n***\n\nLandscape designer Charlie Albone\n\n1. Don\u2019t leave stuff around. I\u2019m always shocked when I go into people\u2019s houses and it\u2019s a pig sty. It\u2019s the same outside, you want to show off as much as you can and not hide it under junk. Low maintenance gardens are a big pull for buyers so ensure the gardens are trimmed and mulched as this gives the appearance the maintenance is easier than it might be.\n\n2. Don\u2019t go crazy and do things just because they are cheap. Often doing something is better than nothing but make sure you don\u2019t add in things just because they are cheap. Consider what buyers are looking at and make changes to the worst parts and think subjectively.\n\n3. Don\u2019t block the front door. Just because you know where your front door is doesn\u2019t mean potential buyers do. Knowing where to go when you turn up to a potential home is more important than you first think. It sets up the buyer\u2019s mindset for the whole property. If your garden is overgrown, it\u2019s time to cut it back.\n\n4. Don\u2019t remove all of the plants. Having a maintained garden is important and people will respond well to lush greenery and manicured plants. If the plants are untidy and scrappy, it\u2019s better to cut them back than remove them.\n\n***\n\nProperty expert Andrew Winter\n\n1. Ignore the market at your peril. Be aware of what is for sale right now and know where your property sits in the market. Be prepared to adapt your price expectations.\n\n2. Don\u2019t assume a mess will be overlooked. Buyers will often forgive a tired and dated home but if it looks or feels inhabitable, they will assume it is a bigger project than it is. So no old curtains, overgrown gardens or overflowing bins. You have a better chance of selling if people feel they can move straight in.\n\n3. Don\u2019t forget about kerb appeal. A lot of people who look online will also do a drive-by. They may also check Google street view so you should know what they will see. Sometimes what they see is years old and can be detrimental so be aware of that and be ready to counter it.\n\n4. Don\u2019t be there. The golden rule is that you shouldn\u2019t be there when the open house inspections are on. A lot of people these days will put in cameras so they don\u2019t have to be there, but just make sure your valuables are put away. It is the agent\u2019s job to ensure the house is secure and it can be off-putting for buyers to have the owners present. Sellers just get in the way and while you might love a certain feature, others may not and will talk openly about it. Sometimes buyers get the perfect property, but usually they don\u2019t.\n\n\n\n*Selling Houses Australia screens on Foxtel\u2019s Lifestyle channel", "description": "There are things that you should do before putting your property on the market.
