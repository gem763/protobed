You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThroughout the month, Okoro captured pictures of himself holding the ring in front of Read as she slept or focused her attention elsewhere in increasingly daring situations.\n\nOne night, Okoro placed the ring in the palm of Read\u2019s hand as she was asleep. When she didn\u2019t realise that, he went as far as putting the ring in her jewellery box for two days without her finding it.\n\nAccording to Okoro, who shared his proposal on social media, he chose to propose this way because he is a \u201cspontaneous improvisor\u201d.\n\n\u201cThose who have gone through this (and those who will soon find out) you want to propose in a way that speaks to you as a person and couple,\u201d Okoro wrote alongside a gallery of all the photos he took of Read. \u201cSome plan a flash mob, a fancy meal or even arrange a marry me sign.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t do this because \u2018Edi doesn\u2019t plan\u2019... I\u2019m a spontaneous improvisor.\u201d\n\nOkoro said Read knowing this aspect of his personality made organising a proposal especially difficult, as she would have \u201cclocked on to what I was about to do\u201d as soon as he planned a holiday or meal.\n\nIt was while carrying the ring around with him \u201ceverywhere hoping the \u2018moment\u2019 would arise in line with my spontaneous style\u201d that he decided to capture all the almost-proposals.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cAfter a month or so of waiting for the right moment, I was sitting on the sofa admiring \u2018my precious\u2019 (yes I became very attached to this ring by this point), Cally almost caught me staring at the ring, and it hit me!\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
