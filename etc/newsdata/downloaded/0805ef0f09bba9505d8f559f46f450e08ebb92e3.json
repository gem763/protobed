He announced on Facebook last week that he\u2019s leaving his job as head of the Salesforce Marketing Cloud and heading back to SAP as president of customer experience.\n\nConstellation Research founder and principal analyst Ray Wang says that Stutz has a reputation for taking companies to the next level. He helped put Microsoft CRM on the map (although it still had just 2.7% marketshare in 2018, according to Gartner) and he helped move the needle at Salesforce Marketing Cloud.\n\n\u201cStutz was the reason Salesforce could grow in the Marketing Cloud and analytics areas. He fixed a lot of the fundamental architectural and development issues at Salesforce, and he did most of the big work in the first 12 months. He got the acquisitions going, as well,\u201d Wang told TechCrunch. He added, \u201cSAP has a big portfolio from CallidusCloud to Hybris to Qualtrics to put together. Bob is the guy you bring in to take a team to the next level.\u201d\n\nBrent Leary, who is a long-time CRM industry watcher, says the move makes a lot of sense for SAP. \u201cHaving Bob return to head up their Customer Experience business is a huge win for SAP. He\u2019s been everywhere, and everywhere he\u2019s been was better for it. And going back to SAP at this particular time may be his biggest challenge, but he\u2019s the right person for this particular challenge,\u201d Leary said.\n\nThe move comes against the backdrop of lots of changes going on at the German software giant. Just last week, long-time CEO Bill McDermott announced he was stepping down, and that Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein would be replacing him as co-CEOs. Earlier this year, the company saw a line of other long-time executives and board members head out the door including including SAP SuccessFactors COO Brigette McInnis-Day, Robert Enslin, president of its cloud business and a board member, CTO Bj\u00f6rn Goerke and Bernd Leukert, a member of the executive board.\n\nHaving Stutz on board could help stabilize the situation somewhat, as he brings more than 25 years of solid software company experience to bear on the company.", "description": "Bob Stutz has had a storied career with enterprise software companies including stints at Siebel Systems, SAP, Microsoft and Salesforce.
