The Heritage Foundation\u2019s research associate Melanie Israel offered the following response:\n\n\u201cThe freedom to act, work and live in accordance with one\u2019s conscience is a fundamental American principle. No person or entity should face discrimination or coercion for declining to participate in procedures, such as abortion or physician-assisted suicide, that violate sincere moral, ethical, or religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s final rule is a much-needed action to protect individual liberties and robustly enforce federal conscience statutes. For more than 40 years, federal law has protected conscience rights of Americans in the context of health care. While the Obama administration provided inadequate enforcement and oversight of federal conscience statutes, this final rule ensures that HHS will safeguard the rights of individuals and entities that dissent on morally sensitive or controversial procedures.\u201d", "description": "Today the Health and Human Services Department issued a final conscience rule\u00a0that protects individuals and health care providers from discrimination or coercion in HHS-funded programs.
