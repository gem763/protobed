William Murchison argues that even past events poorly remembered are worth remembering.\n\nVenice to tax tourists.\n\nVinyl is set to outsell CDs for the first time since 1986.\n\nThe owner of The Strand bookstore plans to sue the New York city government over landmark status.\n\nAn early transcription of The Tale of Genji has been found: \u201cThe original manuscript of the story no longer exists, with the oldest versions of the story believed to have been transcribed by the poet Teika, who died in 1241. Until now, just four chapters of the 54-chapter story are confirmed to be Teika\u2019s transcriptions, but now a fifth chapter, which depicts Genji\u2019s encounter with the girl who becomes his wife, Murasaki, has also been identified as Teika\u2019s.\u201d\n\nEssay of the Day:\n\nIn Humanities, Patrick J.

It goes on to describe his academic credentials: degrees from Harvard, Yale, and Oxford, fellowships from \u2018all the right foundations,\u2019 the grants that he has obtained for the Hill Museum & Manuscript Library, and his distinguished publications on early Christian monasticism.\n\n\u201cBut what the biography does not mention, the photo of Columba makes abundantly clear: There he stands, arms folded, dressed in the habit of a Benedictine monk. This monastic identity is the most salient feature of what makes Columba Stewart the man he is, what drives him in his scholarship to understand the earliest history and even the prehistory of monasticism, what gives him the courage to enter combat zones to rescue manuscripts that few people care about and that still fewer can read. Columba Stewart is a monk.\u201d\n\nRead the rest.\n\nPhoto: Rigi\n\nReceive Prufrock in your inbox every weekday morning.
