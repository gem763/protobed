A group of journalists, including the Guardian, were also temporarily prevented from leaving the theatre.\n\nThe officers looked scared but were not physically harmed as they were asked to remove their helmets, bulletproof vests and boots. The lone female officer in the group was seen wiping away tears.\n\nEcuador paralyzed by national strike as Moreno refuses to step down Read more\n\nJaime Vargas, leader of the indigenous confederation Conaie called on the officers to join opposition protesters in their campaign against the removal of fuel subsidies which has triggered Ecuador\u2019s worst unrest in a decade.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to radicalise with more force, my friends,\u201d said Vargas, before sending a direct message to the president: \u201cDon\u2019t play with indigenous people.\u201d\n\nVargas, complained that media coverage of the protests had ignored police brutality, before calling local television crews on stage and ordering that they broadcast live.\n\nAt least three private broadcasters complied, as indigenous and trade union leaders took it in turn to address the crowd. But the mood turned violent as local TV reporter was attacked by a mob as he tried to leave the building. Other activists attempted to defend the journalist but he was left unconscious and bleeding from the head.\n\nThousands of protesters from across the country \u2013 many in traditional indigenous dress \u2013 have descended on the capital to protest Moreno\u2019s austerity measures.\n\nViolence has flared across the country as demonstrators clashed with police, looted shops and blocked highways.\n\nEcuador\u2019s human rights ombudsman\u2019s office said an indigenous leader and four other people have died. But a spokesman for the president\u2019s office said on Thursday that only two people had died in the clashes.\n\nJos\u00e9 Valencia, Ecuador\u2019s foreign minister, said the government wants dialogue but will not negotiate under the threat of violence and vandalism.\n\n\u201cThis is an extremely critical situation which is not a decision of the indigenous leaders \u2013 we trust their word,\u201d he told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cWe have evidence that this is the result of calls by opposition leaders to use violence, to take control of public institutions and roads and attack the forces of order with violence,\u201d he said.\n\nHe denied reports that police had used excessive force he said they had followed \u201cstrict protocols [which were] drawn up under international norms\u201d.\n\nValencia said around two dozen foreigners, including Venezuelans, had been arrested.\n\nMoreno, 66, has accused his predecessor and one-time mentor Rafael Correa of fomenting the unrest. He has also accused Venezuela of backing a plot to topple his government, without providing evidence.\n\nThe interior minister Mar\u00eda Paula Romo tweeted that 17 Venezuelans had been detained leaving Quito\u2019s international airport on Thursday.\n\nThe government says more than 750 people have been detained and some 80 police officers injured as a result of the clashes.\n\nFuel subsidy cuts were announced of part of a $4.2bn funding plan with the International Monetary Fund, as Moreno tacked further away from the leftwing policies of Correa.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty about what might happen\u201d Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, told the Associated Press. \u201cThe big lesson is that it\u2019s very difficult to go from populism to a more orthodox economic policy.\u201d", "description": "Eight uniformed officers were brought onto a stage and forced to address a crowd of thousands of activists but were not harmed", "authors": ["Dan Collyns"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/859262430c76f058ae3dc3b03902a8b9d45e6f51/977_114_3352_2011/master/3352.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ff1e3e0562498b51a27f50df07645433", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
