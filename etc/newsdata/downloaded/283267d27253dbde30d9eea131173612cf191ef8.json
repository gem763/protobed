(Bert Savard/Radio-Canada)\n\nAlthough the average person uses a smartphone to photograph almost everything these days, the sharpest pictures of the moon are rarely captured with these devices.\n\n\"Smartphones don't offer enough freedom to play with settings, which is necessary when taking photos in situations of extreme contrasts. You can't control the aperture or the shutter speed or ISO to properly expose the scene with a smartphone.\"\n\nFor optimum results, Savard says to use a DSLR camera with at least a 200 millimetre lens. He suggests adjusting the ISO sensitivity to between 100 and 200.\n\n3) Scope out the best location\n\nWhat a crescent moon looks like when aperture is not on the correct setting. (Bert Savard/Radio-Canada)\n\n\"If you're in a lighted area, light may penetrate your lens and the picture will be less detailed.\"\n\nSavard says to find a park or another spot outside the city limits in order to have enough darkness.\n\n\"But make sure you have permission from the farmer before you venture into the field.\"\n\n4) Don't move!\n\nThe moon, photographed at dusk, with white balance adjusted to make the moon really pop. (Bert Savard/Radio-Canada)\n\nAnother indispensable piece of equipment you'll need in order to take nice photos of the moon is a steady tripod.\n\n\"If you move, the moon will look like mush,\" Savard says.\n\nHe also recommends using the self-timer, rather than snapping the shot instantly, because the slightest of movements can spoil a good photo.\n\n5) Last resort: use a telescope\n\nA stargazer waits for the Perseid meteor shower to begin near Bobcaygeon, Ont., on Aug. 12, 2015.
