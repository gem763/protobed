When you\u2019re the team leader (at a World Championships) you have a clear job and it doesn\u2019t matter what comes up, you have to stay focused on that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll play back the decisions I made and once I\u2019ve had a chance to really look through that I\u2019ll have a view.\n\n\u201cI was shocked when it (the report and ban) came out. The timing of it, which obviously wasn\u2019t great in terms of performance for the Doha World Championships.\n\n\u201cMy initial reaction was one of shock and I still feel a little bit like that at the moment.\u201d\n\nSalazar denied the Nike Oregon Project, which he runs, would permit doping, saying he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the outcome and would appeal against the decision.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach has urged the World Anti-Doping Agency to investigate all athletes who trained with Salazar.\n\nBut Black insisted he had no doubts over Farah, who worked with Salazar for six years until 2017.\n\nFarah is not accused of any wrongdoing and said he had \u201cno tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules or crosses a line\u201d after Salazar\u2019s ban was announced.\n\nBlack will also work with Farah at the Chicago Marathon this weekend.\n\n\u201cNothing at all has changed in terms of my belief regarding Mo Farah,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think it is important to repeat that the British Athletics and the medical and support teams were always the people who were always on top of and managing and directing the care of Mo Farah, so we have no concerns.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "British Athletics performance director Neil Black has admitted he will consider his future in the wake of Alberto Salazar\u2018s four-year ban.
