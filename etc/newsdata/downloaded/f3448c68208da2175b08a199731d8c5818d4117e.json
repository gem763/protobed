Two of those have coincided with the absence of Dmitir Payet - who was handed a four-game ban following his sending off against Montpellier.\n\nHis absence has been keenly felt, with the team struggling to create opportunities without him.\n\nVillas-Boas will be hoping the former West Ham man won't be missed when they take on Amiens on Friday night - a side that only Monaco have conceded more than so far in Ligue 1 this season.\n\nJordan Amavi was booed by his own fans during the first half of Marseille's draw with Rennes\n\nParis Saint-Germain v Angers\n\nSaturday, 4.30pm\n\nOne of the most unlikely top-of-the-table clashes in Europe this weekend takes place at the Parc des Princes on Saturday afternoon.\n\nAngers, despite losing all their top performers yet again this summer, have defied all expectations, with Stephane Moulin's side riding high in second place.\n\nThey have taken some hits along the way - with Lyon smashing them for six in the second week of the season - but they do know their way to goal. No side has scored more in the French top flight this season than thier 16 efforts.\n\nThey'll be hoping to keep it tight against a Paris Saint-Germain side that picked up their third 1-0 victory in four matches during their Champions League win in Turkey midweek.\n\nFor once, they didn't have to rely on Neymar, as Mauro Icardi got off the mark. He'll be targeting his first domestic goal at the Parc des Princes on Saturday.\n\nMauro Icardi opened his account for Paris Saint-Germain midweek in the Champions League\n\nDijon v Strasbourg\n\nSaturday, 7pm\n\nAre things finally looking up for Ligue 1's bottom club? Dijon have failed to cut the mustard so far this term, losing each of their first four matches.\n\nBut an upturn in fortunes culminated in their first victory of the season last weekend when they won at Reims.\n\nThey can move off the foot of the table on Saturday evening with a win against a Strasbourg side who themselves have found a bit of form.\n\nWith two wins in their last three, Ludovic Ajorque scored in both successes and will be eager to add to his tally.\n\nLudovic Ajorque has rediscovered his goalscoring touch for Strasbourg, with two in three\n\nNantes v Nice\n\nSaturday, 7pm\n\nNice will be relieved that focus is now back to matters on the pitch after a disruptive week off it.\n\nTeenager Lamine Diaby-Fadiga was sacked by the club after admitting to stealing striker Kasper Dolberg's watch from the training groun changing rooms, admitting that he was driven by 'jealousy' over the Dane's success.\n\nPatrick Vieira's men will be looking to get back on track, with the incident affecting the club's performances - winning just once in their last four outings.\n\nThey face a stern test at Nantes, who picked up a remarkable 1-0 win over Lyon away from home last weekend, largely thanks to the incredible performance of Alban Lafont.\n\nThe on-loan keeper made seven stops in a superb individual display. He'll need to be on similar form to keep out Dolberg and Co.\n\nKasper Dolberg will be looking to add to his two goals so far during his first season at Nice\n\nToulouse v Bordeaux\n\nSaturday, 7pm\n\nNice were not the only side courting controversy off the pitch in Ligue 1 this week.\n\nBordeaux were forced to sack three youth players after a brawl at the club's training centre left another youngster in hospital.\n\nPaulo Sousa's side lost for the first time since the opening day of the season last time out against Paris Saint-Germain, bringing their unbeaten run of six games to a hault.\n\nToulouse provide an immediate opportunity to respond in a positive manner. Alain Casanova's side have failed to win any of their last four, and even contrived to draw with a dire Saint-Etienne side last month. Their 2-2 stalemate with Metz last time out was little better.\n\nMontpellier v Monaco\n\nSaturday, 7pm - BT Sport Extra 3\n\nOne thing is for certain on the Mediterrenean coast on Saturday night - we will see goals.\n\nNo club has seen more scored in their opening eight fixtures in Ligue 1 this season than Leanardo Jardim's Monaco, with 30 already having hit the back of the net.\n\nMore pressingly for Jardim, the majority have been going in at the right end of late, with back-to-back victories lifting the prinicpality outfit out of danger.\n\nWissam Ben-Yedder has hit the ground running since his move from Sevilla this summer, grabbing five goals in six appearances.\n\nHe'll be looking to toast his call-up to the France squad with another, against a Montpellier side who have conceded just six times all season.\n\nWissam Ben Yedder has enjoyed a strong start to life at Monaco, with five goals in six matches\n\nBrest v Metz\n\nSaturday, 7pm\n\nSaturday evening's clash at the Stade Francis-Le Ble has all the trimmings of an early-season relegations six-pointer.\n\nThe two sides who earned promotion from Ligue 2 last term are exactly where you would expect to find them at this point in the season, hovering above the drop zone in 17th and 18th.\n\nMetz have enjoyed the better form of late, following up their 1-0 win over Saint-Etienne with a 2-2 draw at home to Toulouse.\n\nHabib Diallo has been something of a revelation in the early part of the season, and his six goals in eight games have gone a long way to keeping his side afloat.\n\nBrest, meanwhile, have been unable to transform impressive performances into victories, drawing three games in a row before being heavily beaten by Monaco.\n\nHabib Diallo has been a revelation in Ligue 1, grabbing six goals for newly-promoted Metz\n\nLille v Nimes\n\nSunday, 2pm - BT Sport ESPN\n\nLille produced an impressive display against Chelsea in the Champions League but came away with nothing to show for it.\n\nVictor Osimhen shone once more as he grabbed his side's only goal in their 2-1 defeat at home, which leaves them rooted to the bottom of Group H.\n\nIt was the Nigerian's seventh strike of the season in all competitions, and he has now been involved in nine goals in just 10 appearances for Les Dogues.\n\nThe former Charleroi striker will have to be at his best to get the better of a Nimes defence that has conceded just twice in their last five games, keeping three cleansheets in the process.\n\nVictor Osimhen was on target yet again for Lille midweek, but they suffered defeat in Europe\n\nRennes v Reims\n\nSunday, 4pm - BT Sport ESPN\n\nRennes have really stuttered since their flying start to the season - but that may be expected when you pin your hopes on a 16-year-old.\n\nEduardo Camavinga was the Ligue 1 young player of the month for August as Rennes stormed to three victories in their first three matches, but it has not gone to plan since then.\n\nFive matches have brought three draws and two defeats, and it's seven without a win when you include their troubles in Europe.\n\nJulien Stephan has also seen his side fail to score more than once in any of those seven matches, and they may struggle to break that run here.\n\nReims followed up their sublime win against PSG with a ridiculous defeat at home to basement dwellers Dijon, but they still boast the joint best defence in the league, wiht just four goals conceded all season.\n\nSaint-Etienne v Lyon\n\nSunday, 8pm - BT Sport 2\n\nAs is usually the case, Ligue 1 is saving the best until last this weekend.\n\nSaint-Etienne and Lyon have both endured torrid starts to the season, and it looked as though at least one of Sylvinho or Ghislain Pritant would meet their fate following a poor result here - that was until Saint-Etienne jumped the gun.\n\nLes Verts announced on Friday afternoon that Printant had been suspended from his duties, with Claude Puel expected to take his place in time for Sunday.\n\nThat still leaves the former Arsenal defender in peril, though.\n\nLyon roared out of the blocks under Sylvinho but are winless in seven league games after winning their first two by an aggregate of 9-0.\n\nThat has left president Jean-Michel Aulas toying with the idea of doing something he has never done before and sacking a manager in his first season at the club.\n\nWednesday's 2-0 win away at Leipzig in the Champions League brought relief and bought the Brazilian time, but defeat in 'Le Derby' could still prove the fatal blow to his first mangerial role.", "description": "LIGUE 1 PREVIEW: Among the pick of the games is the unlikely top of the table clash at the Parc des Princes, where Paris Saint-Germain welcome this season's surprise package Angers.", "authors": ["Harry Slavin For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/12/19294144-0-image-a-22_1570189568733.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
