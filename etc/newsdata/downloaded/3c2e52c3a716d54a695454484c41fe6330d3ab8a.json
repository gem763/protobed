Most places, actually, that aren\u2019t the U.S., Europe or Japan.\n\nInvestors in emerging market sovereigns have been richly rewarded this year, even relative to other sectors of a surging fixed-income market. Yields, which run inversely to prices, have plunged faster than U.S. Treasury debt, tightening the average spread on dollar-denominated emerging market bonds by 90 basis points, or 0.9%, says Eric Baurmeister, head of emerging markets debt at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. That\u2019s spurred a total return near 14% for the iShares JP Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond exchange-traded fund (ticker: EMB), compared to 11.5% for U.S. high yield, an asset class with which it competes for capital.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t jump on the rally already, you probably missed it. \u201cI\u2019m not overly optimistic that we\u2019ll have the same kind of spread tightening going forward,\u201d Baurmeister says. \u201cThe majority of this money has already been made.\u201d\n\nThe overriding fact of bond-market life this year has been the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s January U-turn toward lowering rates. That set off a global scramble for bonds at current interest rates. U.S. junk might look like the big winner: Yields have dropped faster than on emerging-market paper, and remain higher, says Gary Pzegeo, head of fixed income at CIBC Private Wealth Management. The average yield to maturity on the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond fund (HYG) is 5.2%, compared to 4.7% for the emerging market ETF.\n\nBut emerging markets have had an ace in the hole in the form of duration: 12 years instead of 3.5. Roughly speaking, bond prices are calculated by yield compression times the number of years a holder can expect to benefit from that change. Now that rates look to be leveling out, advantage shifts to the better-paying junk bonds, Pzegeo figures. \u201cIn an environment where rates have stabilized, I would rather clip the coupon,\u201d he says.\n\nEmerging market specialists are hunting off the beaten track to keep the outsized bond returns rolling. Shamaila Khan, director of emerging market debt at AllianceBernstein, likes Nigeria, Egypt, Costa Rica, and the deeply discounted debt on offer from Argentina. \u201cEM high yield still looks very attractive on a relative basis to U.S. high yield,\u201d she says. \u201cThe spread is in the top 10% of its historic average.\u201d\n\nTim Jagger, head of emerging markets debt at Columbia Threadneedle, also believes Ukraine, where actor-turned-president Volodymyr Zelensky shows promise on reform and the latest Eurobond issue paid 6.75% for seven-year money. Jagger also likes Pemex, the ailing but state-supported Mexican oil company whose debt yields more than 6%, even after a $5 billion cash injection from the government on Sept. 11.\n\n\u201cFor our investors, emerging market bonds are not a strategic asset,\u201d CIBC\u2019s Pzegeo says. That could change as returns from other bonds stay lower for longer. The asset class\u2019s 50 basis-point yield lag from U.S. junk is offset by considerably lower risk. Half the emerging market dollar bond index is investment grade. The risk profile is getting better as hapless Venezuela has been booted from the index and Saudi Arabia, Qatar and United Arab Emirates enter. Investors shrugged off the meltdown in Argentina as more established borrowers like Brazil and Mexico maintain or improve fiscal discipline.\n\n\u201cThere are some good stories out there, which is why spreads have come in,\u201d Baurmeister says.\n\nJust expect a breather before they do better.", "description": "Emerging market specialists are hunting off the beaten track in places like Nigeria and Egypt to keep the outsized returns rolling.", "authors": ["Craig Mellow"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-105377/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
