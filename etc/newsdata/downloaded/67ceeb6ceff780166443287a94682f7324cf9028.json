USA TODAY\n\nCLEVELAND \u2013 They can\u2019t pin this one on the refs.\n\nNo, Cleveland Browns, look in the mirror and see the egg on your face for what it is.\n\nYou blew it.\n\nSure, there were way too many head-scratching calls that went against Cleveland in the 32-28 setback that left the Browns (2-4) still search their first home victory of the season.\n\nBut there were even more cases of Browns blunders \u2013 in strategy and execution \u2013 that left much to the imagination of what might have been.\n\nIn the aftermath, though, Baker Mayfield was willing to make a charitable donation in order to get it on record that he thought the Browns were big-time victims of shabby officiating.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll probably get fined for saying this, but it was pretty bad today,\u201d Mayfield said.\n\nMore: Chiefs can't keep asking Patrick Mahomes to cover for their fatal flaws\n\nMore: San Francisco 49ers shut down Jared Goff and keep the Los Angeles Rams reeling\n\nHe grumbled about the illegal blindside block penalty on Jarvis Landry that wiped out a dazzling, cross-field catch-and-run by Nick Chubb that would have moved the chains. He whined about the officials missing a facemask penalty the Seahawks apparently committed against Chubb during a goal-line pileup. And like his coach, Freddie Kitchens, he thought Landry crossed the plane of the end zone on the fumble that wasn\u2019t reversed by instant replay.\n\nTough breaks. Mayfield, who also maintained, \u201cthe refs are never an excuse,\u201d had some legitimate beefs as referee Adrian Hill\u2019s crew dropped 19 flags on the two teams to underscore some of the general sloppiness on display.\n\nJust don\u2019t believe the Browns were robbed \u2014 unless they burglarized themselves.\n\nQuick, Roger Goodell, pass a new rule: Teams that commit five or more turnovers can\u2019t complain about officials \u2026 even when the calls and replays don\u2019t always match up.\n\nNo, this loss falls at the feet of the undisciplined team that committed five turnovers, had a punt blocked, blew a 20-6 lead and inexplicably kept tempting fate with some questionable play-calling near the goal line.\n\nBefore that Landry fumble early in the fourth quarter, the Browns, trailing 25-20, had two cracks from the Seahawks\u2019 1-yard line. Yet rather than try pounding it in with Chubb, who finished with 122 rushing yards, Kitchens put it on Mayfield\u2019s arm. And the third-down fade pass to Odell Beckham Jr. didn\u2019t come close to being completed. On fourth down, Kitchens called a play that had Mayfield in a shotgun with an empty backfield. Mayfield threw a quick pass to Landry that resulted in the fumble.\n\nThe Browns dodged that episode as the Seahawks were penalized for having 12 men on the field. After Chubb was stuffed on the ensuing fourth down, the Browns forced a punt and started the next drive with prime field position that led to the TD. Yet with the lost challenge, they also lost a timeout that could have come in handy at crunch time.\n\nAh, crunch time. Mayfield\u2019s last pass of the day, a fling to the flat for running back Dontrell Hilliard, was behind the target. So much for a game-winning drive, which the Browns were clearly think when they took over with 3:30 remaining. Instead, Mayfield\u2019s errant throw resulted in a too-easy interception for K.J. Wright. Ballgame.\n\nOn the season, that with INT No. 11 for Mayfield (who has thrown for 5 TDs). That\u2019s no way to win.\n\nLook at Russell Wilson, having an MVP season for the Seahawks. He passed for 295 yards with 2 touchdowns and didn\u2019t commit a turnover. Composure was his ticket. When his team trailed by 14 points early, he didn\u2019t flinch. When the radio receiver in his helmet malfunctioned, he stayed cool and started calling his own plays in up-tempo fashion as if it were no sweat. He ran his number of fourth-quarter game-winning victory drives to 30, more than anyone else since he entered the NFL in 2012.\n\nSure, the Seahawks have been through a lot over the years, with a handful of veterans still in tow from the Legion of Boom glory run. They know not to panic.\n\nThen again, if Mayfield hadn\u2019t throw a pick just before halftime, maybe there would have been no need for last-minute drama. The Browns were set up beautifully, leading 20-12 with second down from the Seahawks\u2019 10-yard line inside the two-minute warning. But Mayfield\u2019s throw for Landry in the end zone was a bit behind the target, and Shaquill Griffin deflected it into the arms of Tedric Thompson \u2013 a turnover that Wilson\u2019s Seahawks converted into an 88-yard TD drive that was pretty much a 14-point swing.\n\nSo, as much as the Browns were vexed by the officials, their frustrations shouldn\u2019t come anywhere close to the disdain they should have for their own blunders.\n\nThere were several cases when Mayfield was on the mark but his targets muffed or outright dropped the passes. There were first downs negated by holding penalties. Missed tackles. Busted coverages. A lot of teaching moments on video, with a bye week to use for corrections.\n\nKitchens praised his team for the effort and was encouraged by the efficiency early in the game \u2013 which ultimately was undone by the turnovers. Sugar-coating the bottom line won\u2019t cut it. And tight calls or not, the coach admitted that some of the penalties (nine for 83 yards) were disturbing because they reflected a lack of concentration.\n\n\u201cSometimes, it is playing with emotion instead of passion,\u201d he said, alluding to the roughing-the-passer and late hit calls. \u201cDuring the play, it\u2019s technique, being lazy or not doing your job. There are several things. We do not ever practice penalties.\u201d\n\nMaybe that\u2019s not a bad idea, because whatever the Browns are practicing, they just can\u2019t seem to get it right with enough consistency.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a long season. Being 2-4 is not a death sentence. This team that entered the season with so many expectations, so much hype and, yes, so much swagger, has time to rally to make a playoff push \u2013 especially with a schedule that seemingly becomes less grueling down the stretch.\n\nBut to live up to their hope, the Browns surely need to learn to not beat themselves.\n\nThese may be the growing pains, but at the moment they reflect a reality.\n\nFollow Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell.", "description": "Baker Mayfield wasn't too happy with NFL officials after the Browns' loss to the Seahawks, but his team needs to look inward.", "authors": ["Jarrett Bell", "Published P.M.
