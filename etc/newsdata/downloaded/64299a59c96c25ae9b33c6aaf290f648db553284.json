Andrea Verdelli/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\n\nOn Tuesday night, Araoz abruptly renounced her claim after a public outcry in which military leaders rallied around Vizcarra, who has pushed anti-corruption reforms in defiance of the opposition-controlled Congress.\n\nThe bizarre episode - which meant the South American nation briefly had two rival claimants to the presidency - was the latest twist in Peru\u2019s worst constitutional crisis in decades, as Vizcarra and lawmakers have jostled for power.\n\nAraoz\u2019s step-down marked a major blow for the opposition. They had declared Vizcarra suspended on the grounds he had violated the constitution in his push to strong-arm lawmakers into backing his anti-graft proposals.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, shortly before announcing her resignation, Araoz, known in Peru as \u2018Mechita\u2019 - a diminutive of \u2018Mercedes\u2019 \u2013 suggested she had accepted the interim role only as a \u201cpolitical act\u201d rather than a power grab.\n\nShe said she knew the move would put her political standing in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cToday a large part of the country hates me. I understand their grief,\u201d Araoz told Reuters at her apartment overlooking a large garden in the capital district of Miraflores. \u201cWe clearly had a terrible Congress. But that\u2019s no reason to close it.\u201d\n\nThe move had stoked tensions, with street protests in support of Vizcarra, while lawmakers had holed up in Congress refusing to leave.\n\nAraoz said she no longer recognized the centrist Vizcarra as president but hoped she could still help mediate a dispute between him and members of the right-wing opposition who have deemed him a \u201cdictator.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ll do is try to find consensus,\u201d said Araoz, who now works from her apartment after being barred from Congress.\n\nVizcarra has said he had no choice but to invoke a nuclear option in Peru\u2019s constitution to call new legislative elections, saying he preferred to let voters weigh in on his year-long push to get Congress to pass his anti-graft reforms.\n\nGraft scandals have tainted judges, lawmakers and four former presidents in recent years, and the opposition-run Congress has emerged as one of Peru\u2019s most unpopular institutions.\n\nAraoz said she would accept any ruling by Peru\u2019s top Constitutional Court on the legality of Vizcarra\u2019s move to dissolve Congress and called on him to do the same.\n\nThe lawmaker, who ran a failed presidential bid in 2011, told Reuters she would \u201clove to\u201d sit down with Vizcarra and the recently-dismissed head of Congress to work out differences.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be satisfied with that,\u201d she said.", "description": "In a hasty ceremony on Monday, rebel lawmakers swore in Vice President Mercedes Araoz as Peru's interim leader, looking to install her in place of President Martin Vizcarra after he moved to dissolve Congress to end a long-running political stand-off.", "authors": ["Marco Aquino", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436265928&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9113S"}
