The Samrat intercontinental ballistic missile, the Project 4202 hypersonic glide vehicle, a long-range torpedo and the Kinzhal air-to-surface missile all had been in development for years.\n\n\"None of this will give Russia an advantage,\" said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project in Washington, D.C.\n\nBut the fifth weapon\u2014the SSC-X-9\u2014was unknown to the public before Putin's speech. The new missile is meant to avoid American missile-defenses, which are optimized for shooting down incoming ballistic missiles that fly high in the atmosphere and thus are easy to detect on radar.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Bad for the environment and global security.", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Rhtjkp_uu01kXnBZhuuK9Q--~B/aD05MzU7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/32fb7fe2a15c5413ef89c6da031c1955", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
