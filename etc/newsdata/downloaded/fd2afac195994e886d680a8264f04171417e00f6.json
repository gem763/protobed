He said several women who attended the event later told him Fisher\u2019s remarks made them feel \u201cvery uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nFisher subsequently expressed regret for his comments, saying in a message to AFP that \u201cI realize this kind of language has no place in our company or industry. I sincerely apologize.\u201d\n\nBut the damage was done. Several financial entities broke ties with Fisher Investments, which manages some $112 billion.\n\nThe city of Boston was among those.\n\n\u201cBoston will not invest in companies led by people who treat women like commodities,\u201d said Mayor Marty Walsh.\n\n\u2013 \u2018We are very concerned\u2019 \u2013\n\nAccording to a tally by the CNBC network, Fisher Investments lost around $1 billion in managed assets within days.\n\nThe total could grow, since Fidelity Investments, one of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, expressed its unhappiness and said it was reviewing the relationship.\n\n\u201cWe are very concerned about the highly inappropriate comments by Kenneth Fisher,\u201d a Fidelity spokesperson said. \u201cThe views he expressed do not align in any way with our company\u2019s values. We do not tolerate these types of comments at our company.\u201d\n\nFisher manages about $500 million in Fidelity\u2019s assets, CNBC said.\n\nWhile Wall Street traders\u2019 excesses and verbal outrages have been the subject of numerous films, the heads of big companies and financial groups generally have done their best to stay above the fray, though not all have succeeded.\n\n\u201cThe brand is the company\u2019s value and the CEO is identified with the brand,\u201d said Charles Elson, a specialist in corporate governance at the University of Delaware, \u201cwhich is why it\u2019s just a really good idea for a CEO to focus on running the business and to avoid getting into political or social controversy when speaking publicly.\n\n\u201cWhen they do, it naturally creates problems.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Everyone is afraid\u2019 \u2013\n\nTravis Kalanick, a co-founder of Uber, was thus forced out in 2017 amid reports that the company\u2019s workplace culture included sexual harassment and discrimination.\n\nElon Musk had to give up the chairmanship of Tesla this year after his Twitter use got him in trouble with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, Wall Street\u2019s \u201cpoliceman.\u201d\n\nIn September, the co-founder of WeWork, Adam Neumann, stepped down as chief executive amid complaints about his lavish lifestyle and some impulsive actions that he himself said had become \u201ca significant distraction.\u201d\n\nAcross the world of high finance, meanwhile, Fisher\u2019s remarks were widely denounced.\n\nArt Hogan, chief market strategist with National Holdings, said that \u201cit\u2019s never appropriate to use that kind of language. That would be true today, and it was 20 years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it was the norm back to a time of the TV show \u2018Mad Men,\u2019\u201d which was set mostly in the New York advertising world of the 1960s, \u201cbut it has not been in my career.\u201d\n\nAnd in a world where the \u201cESG investing trend\u201d is growing, Hogan said \u2014 referring to an emphasis on environmentalism, social issues and governance concerns \u2014 \u201cit even speaks louder.\u201d\n\nGregori Volokhine, president of Meeschaert Financial Services, said that Fisher\u2019s remarks were not necessarily anything new in the financial world.\n\n\u201cExcept now, everyone is afraid between the rise of the #MeToo movement and ESG management,\u201d Volokhine said.", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 The #MeToo movement recently reached dramatically into the world of high finance, as one prominent Wall Street figure learned after", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/effc2b_heads-big-companies-financial-groups-generally-stay-fray-metoo-movement-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
