She agreed with a questioner who argued Americans should be eating less meat and that the government should force them into other dietary habits.\n\nKamala Harris says Americans need to be \"educated about the effect of our eating habits on our environment,\" and says she would change the dietary guidelines to reduce the amount of red meat you can eat. #ClimateTownHall pic.twitter.com/XqcFzLv479 \u2014 Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) September 4, 2019\n\nJust last month, this was Harris at the Iowa State Fair.\n\nFinally got my pork chop! pic.twitter.com/3LUSKorixU \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) August 11, 2019\n\nNot only is Harris' promise to limit meat intake hypocritical, it's part of a broader globalist push. From a Time piece titled, \"If We Want to Stop Climate Change, Now is a Moment of Reckoning for How We Use the Planet, Warns U.N. Report\":\n\nScientists say a shift away from eating meat toward plant-based diets could yield big dividends in the fight against climate change. Reduced meat consumption means lower emissions from livestock and the fertilizer needed to sustain them but also provides an opportunity to reforest land that farmers would have otherwise used for grazing. Rethinking the human diet across the globe could drive emissions reductions of up to 8 gigatonnes annually, according to the report, greater than an entire year of emissions in the U.S.\n\nWhen I was in China two years ago a woman in the communist party, who works with the UN, talked all about the necessity of changing eating habits and eliminating meat. By government force. This is communism and 2020 Democrats are fully embracing it. https://t.co/w9ISr334UF \u2014 Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) September 5, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, here's what's really happening with \"climate change\" and emissions in the United States.", "description": ".09/06/2019 8:10:40AM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/212/29844c7e-b0bb-4dc6-a399-d4c1e3875b63.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
