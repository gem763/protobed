But does it even work? Learn how to give advice with this week's viral tweet!\n\nBy Amelie Marie Nishizawa Oct 12, 2019 4 min read\n\nChiba Prefecture is still recovering from the massive power outages and damages caused by Typhoon Faxai last month, but now Japan is bracing itself for yet another potentially destructive typhoon. Called Hagibis\u2014a Tagalog word for \u201cvelocity\u201d\u2014the typhoon is set to be one of the most powerful on record.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis is no joke\n\nThe forecast for wind and torrential rain is getting grimmer by the hour. Categorized as a violent typhoon, the highest category on the Japanese scale, Hagibis is making landfall today. Matches for the Rugby World Cup, the F1 race and the long-awaited return of the Backstreet Boys in a special concert have either been canceled or postponed. Airlines and train companies have also announced the suspension of some services until Sunday.\n\nAs the second most powerful storm to hit planet earth in 2019, the Japan Meteorological Agency is urging the public to take precautions. The size, speed, and timing of the storm makes it a serious danger for coastal areas, as well as the Tokyo region.\n\nWhat to do\n\nWell, for starters, avoid going out when the typhoon lands in your area. If there\u2019s a lesson we learned with Typhoon Faxai last month, it\u2019s that the danger comes from sudden flooding and/or flying or falling objects. Trees, branches, roofs and even garden walls can give in to the strong winds.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t gotten yourself a nicely packed emergency kit, it\u2019s probably a good time to put together a simple pack that can keep you going in the event of a natural disaster. Store some snacks, emergency food, and water, as well as batteries for flashlights and fully charged portable batteries for your phone. Nothing worse than a dying phone during a power outage!\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk windows\n\nFear of broken windows and flying pieces of glass has prompted quite a lot of Japanese Twitter users to promote using tape on their windows.\n\nTaping Xs on them is said to make the glass stronger and, were it to break, prevent pieces from scattering all over the place.\n\n\u4f4f\u5b85\u5bc6\u96c6\u5730 \uff08 \u3058\u3085\u3046\u305f\u304f\u307f\u3063\u3057\u3085\u3046\u3061 \uff09 \u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001 \u98a8 \uff08 \u304b\u305c \uff09 \u306e \u5f71\u97ff \uff08 \u3048\u3044\u304d\u3087\u3046 \uff09 \u306f \u5c11 \uff08 \u3059\u304f \uff09 \u306a\u3044\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3051\u3069 \u74e6 \uff08 \u304b\u308f\u3089 \uff09 \u304c \u98db \uff08 \u3068 \uff09 \u3093\u3067\u304d\u3066\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u306b \u76f4\u6483 \uff08 \u3061\u3087\u304f\u3052\u304d \uff09 \u3059\u308b\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067 \u6c17\u4f11 \uff08 \u304d\u3084\u3059 \uff09 \u3081\u306b \u990a\u751f \uff08 \u3088\u3046\u3058\u3087\u3046 \uff09 \u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3067 \u88dc\u5f37 \uff08 \u307b\u304d\u3087\u3046 \uff09 \u3057\u3066\u304a\u304f\u3002 100\u5186\u5747\u4e00 \uff08 \u3072\u3083\u304f\u3048\u3093\u304d\u3093\u3044\u3064 \uff09 \u306e 1\u5dfb \uff08 \u3044\u3061\u307e\u304d \uff09 10\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u3060\u3068 \u819d \uff08 \u3072\u3056 \uff09 \u304b\u3089 \u982d \uff08 \u3042\u305f\u307e \uff09 \u304f\u3089\u3044\u306e \u9ad8 \uff08 \u305f\u304b \uff09 \u3055\u306e\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9 \u7a93 \uff08 \u307e\u3069 \uff09 1\u679a\u5206 \uff08 \u3044\u3061\u307e\u3044\u3076\u3093 \uff09 \u306e\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u3057\u304b\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u3001\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3068\u3057\u305f\u3084\u3064\u3092 \u8cb7 \uff08 \u304b \uff09 \u3063\u3066\u304d\u305f\u65b9\u304c \u826f \uff08 \u3088 \uff09 \u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d\u3002\n\n= In a densely populated area the risk associated with the wind might be small, but flying tiles can hit the glass, so I\u2019ll reinforce (the windows) with curing tape. A 100 yen store roll is about 10 meters long and just enough for one window with a height from about the knee to the head, so it\u2019s better to go and buy a proper one at a home center.\n\nSince Thursday, Japanese people have been panic buying reinforced tape, and home centers are now out of stock. The news made the headlines as manufacturers struggled to keep up with the sudden increase in demand.\n\n\u53f0\u98a819\u53f7 \uff08 \u305f\u3044\u3075\u3046\u3058\u3085\u3046\u304d\u3085\u3046\u3054\u3046 \uff09 \u3067\u201d\u990a\u751f\u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u201d \u58f2 \uff08 \u3046 \uff09 \u308a \u5207 \uff08 \u304d \uff09 \u308c \u76f8\u6b21 \uff08 \u3042\u3044\u3058 \uff09 \u3050 \u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u300c \u6ce8\u6587 \uff08 \u3061\u3085\u3046\u3082\u3093 \uff09 \u304c \u6025\u5897 \uff08 \u304d\u3085\u3046\u305e\u3046 \uff09 \u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u300d\n\n= Because of the Typhoon Hagibis (typhoon no.19) curing tape stockists are running out out one after another. \u201cOrders are rapidly increasing.\u201d\n\nDreading the hassle of finding curing tape (what even is curing tape?!) and X-ing all your windows one by one?\n\nWell, the measure seems to actually be a myth.\n\nhttps://t.co/jN7HEmwlCf I'm not sure why they continue to give out this widely debunked advice in Japan. \u2014 \ud83d\udc7b\u304a\u5316\u3051\u5c4b\u6577\ud83d\udc7b (@wesinjapan) October 10, 2019\n\n\u3082\u3063\u3068\u30a8\u30d3\u30c7\u30f3\u30b9\u3092 \u51fa \uff08 \u3060 \uff09 \u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002 \u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab \u5408\u8846\u56fd\u56fd\u571f\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u7701 \uff08 \u304c\u3063\u3057\u3085\u3046\u3053\u304f\u3053\u304f\u3069\u3042\u3093\u305c\u3093\u307b\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3057\u3087\u3046 \uff09 \u304c\u51fa\u3057\u305f \u707d\u5bb3\u5bfe\u7b56 \uff08 \u3055\u3044\u304c\u3044\u305f\u3044\u3055\u304f \uff09 \u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u3053\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a \u8a18\u8f09 \uff08 \u304d\u3055\u3044 \uff09 \u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002 https://fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1622-20490-3346/hurricanefactsheet_final.pdf\u2026 \u30c6\u30fc\u30d7\u306b\u3088\u308b\u7a93\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u88dc\u5f37\u306f \u5168 \uff08 \u307e\u3063\u305f \uff09 \u304f\u6301\u3063\u3066 \u610f\u5473 \uff08 \u3044\u307f \uff09 \u304c\u306a\u3044\u3068\u306e \u4e8b \uff08 \u3053\u3068 \uff09 \u3002\n\n= Here\u2019s more evidence.
