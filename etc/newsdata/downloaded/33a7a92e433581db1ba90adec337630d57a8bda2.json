Wamsutta Extra-Firm Side-Sleeper Pillow (Off last list)\n\nAlthough it was off the list for a few weeks, this pillow has appeared on our list 18 times \u2014 the second most of any product. We discovered it when we tested out a wide selection of pillows designed for side sleepers, and concluded that the Wamsutta Extra-Firm was the most comfortable and supportive of them all: \u201cUnlike other pillows that mistake plushness or fluffiness for support, the WEF didn\u2019t sink as soon as I rested my head. Instead, it had a firm, satisfying spring \u2014 it\u2019s a different sensation, but one I took to right away. And even though I didn\u2019t do any measuring, my head felt more propped up from the mattress and sheets than with any other pillow.\u201d", "description": "Strategist readers are buying Oral-B electric toothbrushes, Anker lightning cables, Purito sunscreen, Cosrx snail essence, NatraCure gel heel sleeves, Boon bath toys, Press Here board books, Uberlube lubricant, Wamsutta pillows, and more.", "authors": ["The Editors"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/08/22/26-bestseller-lede.w1200.h630.jpg"}
