The company said it has spent a year trying to \u201cclarify misunderstandings about the company and address their concerns,\u201d and that this will hurt its U.S. business partners.\n\nProminent Chinese AI firms such as Sense Time, Megvii and iFlytek are also on the list. Sense Time and Megvii are known for the development of computer vision technology that underpins facial recognition products, while iFlytek is known for its voice recognition and translation services.\n\nThe companies are among 28 organizations added to the blacklist Monday. Along with the tech companies, the Commerce Department\u2019s filing targets local government agencies in China\u2019s northwestern Xinjiang region.\n\nThe filing said the listed groups have been implicated in \u201cChina\u2019s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance\u201d against Uighurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim minority groups.\n\nThe Chinese embassy and several of the targeted companies didn\u2019t immediately return requests for comment Monday.\n\nThe Trump administration earlier this year used the same blacklisting process to punish Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant targeted by the U.S. over national security concerns. Added to the list in June were five Chinese groups working in supercomputing.\n\nRoss said Monday\u2019s action will ensure U.S. technologies \u201care not used to repress defenseless minority populations.\u201d\n\nChina is estimated to have detained up to 1 million Muslims in prison-like detention centers in the region. The detentions come on top of harsh travel restrictions and a massive surveillance network equipped with facial recognition technology. China has denied committing abuses in the centers and has described them as schools aimed at providing employable skills and combating extremism.", "description": "The United States is blacklisting a group of Chinese tech companies that develop facial recognition and other artificial intelligence technology that the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/08/e40235_us-china-tech-blacklist-58862-thursday-jan-10-2019-file-photo-shows-iflytek-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
