We're together all the time training, and we're so immersed in Strictly and doing everything for the show, so that stuff hasn't even entered our thoughts.\"\n\nNeil added that he and Alex are \"dancing, dancing, dancing, (having) a little bit of sleep, dancing, dancing, dancing...\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAlex said that viewers \"have fun seeing just our personality and how much we're just enjoying every Saturday night, which is great - watching the show that's what you want.\"\n\nFormer Arsenal player Alex said she has not had any extra attention since being on the show, joking that potential suitors may be \"scared\" of her.\n\n\"No-one's sliding into my DMs yet,\" she quipped.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nNeil, who split from wife and fellow Strictly pro Katya in August, said that he is focusing on dancing and on the programme.\n\nThe couple had been together for 11 years and celebrated their sixth wedding anniversary earlier this year.\n\nTheir separation came months after Katya was pictured kissing her former Strictly celeb partner, comedian Seann Walsh, last October.\n\nHowever the dancing couple were adamant the kiss was not the cause of their split, indicating their marriage had become more a friendship than a romance.\n\n(Image: Supplied by WENN)\n\nFreshly single Neil said: \"I won't be doing any dating apps. I've never done a dating app - there weren't any when I was last single.\n\n\"I'm just going to stick to dancing for the time being.\"\n\nOf his former wife still wearing her wedding ring while he doesn't, Neil said: \"We're not together any more.\n\n\"I never used to wear my wedding ring when we were dancing, that was just something for me because I don't really like jewellery.\n\n\"But Katya, you know, she just likes her jewellery, so if she's wearing it, she's wearing it.\"\n\nHe went on to reveal: \"We're really good friends and we're in a really good place right now.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAlex and Neil were due to perform a commercial/street routine to the Ghostbusters theme for Strictly\u2019s Halloween special last night, but their plans were scuppered when Neil was forced to pull out due to an injury.\n\nIn his place, reigning champion Kevin Clifton stepped in to partner Alex, giving him just 45 minutes to learn an entire routine.\n\nAlex and Kevin secured a total of 34 points out of a possible 40, and received a standing ovation from the audience.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing: The Results is on BBC One at 7.15pm on Sunday.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
