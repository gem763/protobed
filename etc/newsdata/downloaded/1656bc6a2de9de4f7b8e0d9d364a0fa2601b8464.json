BOJ surprised markets on the 29th January 2016 by going into negative rates of -0.1, a move that was designed to achieve 2% inflation \u201cat the earliest possible time.\u201d Well, 3 years and 9 months later, core CPI hasn\u2019t been anywhere near 2% and is now just 0.5% YoY.\n\nGoing off headlines earlier this month, expectations for BOJ to go further into negative territory tomorrow had been on the rise. Yet optimism of trade talks between the US and China may remove the immediate argument for action, although it remains apparent that BOJ has been laying the groundwork for some action.\n\nJust some of Kuroda\u2019s comments in October (newest to oldest)\n\nBOJ will ease if needed, and it still has room to do so\n\nBOJ still has room to top up stimulus but what steps it takes will depend on decisions at each meeting\n\nRisks to the economy are tilted to the downside\n\nNo need to rule out any policy option, including deepening of negative rates\n\nBOJ has become more keen to ease than before as risks to economy heighten\n\nBOJ can combine, enhance tools which are rate cuts, increase asset buying and acceleration of base money\n\nIf oil prices continue to fall and clearly push down Japan\u2019s inflation, that could affect inflation expectations\n\nConsidering that (the lack of) inflation expectations were a key reason as to why BOJ went into a negative rate in the first place, then oil prices inflation expectations could be the easiest guide to decipher whether they\u2019ll go further into negative territory and how far. Yet whilst there are multiple mentions of cutting rates, he does also speak about the further stimulus. So as per usual, BOJ is keeping markets on their toes despite their vow to be more open with any forward guidance. Taking the above into account, BOJ appears set to do something tomorrow, even if it means just spelling out what they\u2019ll do at a later meeting.\n\nThis could include:\n\nExpanding the monetary base / Purchasing more ETF\u2019s\n\nAdjusting their YCC (yield curve control)\n\nGoing further into negative rates (probably by another -10 bps to -0.2%)\n\nForward Returns Chart\n\nHow did markets fare when BOJ went into negative rates?\n\nDemand for JPY as a safe haven was apparent, seeing USD/JPY and AUD/JPY depreciate 5% over the next 20 days. That said, both markets traded higher on the day of the announcement.\n\nThe banking sector, whose profits are directly influenced by interest rates, declined 20% just 20 days after BOJ went to -0.1%. It also closed lower on the day negative rates were announced.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 (Japan 225 CFD/DFT) also reacted positively on T+0 to T+1, before declining -0.85% by T+20 (and to -10% by T+60)\n\nSo the basic pattern following negative rates is to see the yen strengthen (USD/JPY, AUD/JPY, etc., lower) and stocks weaken (most notably the banking sector. So, if BOJ neither cuts rates or hints that they will tomorrow, we\u2019d expect a rally in these markets following the meeting.\n\nUSD/JPY Daily Chart\n\nUSD/JPY: The daily structure remains bullish, although traders appear cautious around the highs. A small, bearish Doji formed yesterday, and a bearish divergence has formed with RSI. Interestingly, the overnight implied volatility (ON IV) range falls near 108.25 support and 109.31 resistance, meaning options markets are suggesting a 62% chance prices will close within these levels.\n\nIf BOJ stands pat and trade relations between the US and China blossom, we could see this braking to new highs.\n\nBut, remembering that forward returns were positive for JPY last time around, then USD/JPY faces downside potential if BOJ ease, add stimulus, or strongly suggest it\u2019s on its way.\n\nEUR/JPY Daily Chart\n\nEUR/JPY: Regardless of the outcome tomorrow, the bullish trend structure on EUR/JPY appears firm and trades in a potential bull flag pattern just off its cycle high. A minor pullback has been seen which and Monday\u2019s bullish engulfing candle suggests the low could be in at 120.35. Whilst it trades within a bullish channel, we\u2019re open for it to break above the upper trendline (hence the dashed line), given the strength of bullish momentum within the channel.\n\nBias is for a break to new highs (and possibly up through the trendline) if 120.35 holds as support\n\nThere\u2019s still room for a deeper retracement towards the 38.2% Fibonacci level / 120 handle, so we\u2019ll reassess price action if it breaks below 120.35 and look for a higher to form\n\nNZD/JPY Daily Chart\n\nNZD/JPY: Here, the structure appears less convincing for the bull-camp. A bearish pin bar and engulfing candle reaffirmed the resistance zone around the 50% retracement level, and the two bearish bears from the high show all is not well at these less-than-giddy highs. Furthermore, another pin bar appeared yesterday, just above 68.98. Given the longer-term bearish channel, large overlaps of price action between swing in its current \u2018bullish\u2019 channel. Price action continues to look corrective against the bearish channel.\n\nFrom here, swing traders could wait for a break below 68.94 and target the 67.84 low.\n\nA bullish argument becomes more appealing if/when it breaks above the bearish channel and starts printing higher lows with much shallower retracements.\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
