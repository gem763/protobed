The central London institution has a capacity of 2,256.\n\nEarlier this year tickets to La Forza del Destino at the Royal Opera House were being flogged Viagogo for more than \u00a31,872 despite having a face value of \u00a3125\n\nJohn Allison, editor of Opera Magazine, said: 'Ordinary opera lovers won't be able to get near these tickets and it raises all the old questions of accessibility of opera houses and their tier schemes.\n\nAfter all, the taxpayer subsidises opera houses especially Covent Garden, and therefore they should be open to everyone.\n\n'I think it's rather sad that Covent Garden are doing this and alienating everybody else.\n\n'Normally these schemes work, but when members of 'the club' have access to tickets that others don't, it doesn't look good.\n\n'This show is probably the most hotly anticipated production of the season.'\n\n'It will be interesting to see what happens to these [Beethoven's Fidelio] tickets nearer the time next year,' Mr Allison said.\n\nOpera fan Penelope Simpson, 55, a writer from Dorset, told the Evening Standard: 'I just think this is absolutely appalling, I can't say how angry I am.\n\n'There's nothing on their website to tell the public you can't get these tickets.\n\n'I really hate this behaviour and not just because I want to see Fidelio, but because I want to trust a place I love and where I have spent tens of thousands of pounds over the years.'\n\nThe Royal Opera House would not tell The Daily Telegraph how many tickets would go on general sale today - only saying 'hundreds'.\n\nA spokeswoman said: 'There will be hundreds of tickets available across many different price bands when public booking opens for Fidelio tomorrow morning.\n\n'Following this, tickets will be available through our Friday Rush ticket scheme, which ensures members of the public have access to our most popular productions at affordable prices every week.\n\n'The production will also be relayed live to 1500 cinemas across the globe on the 17 March, 500 of which will be in the UK.'", "description": "The 'hotly anticipated' six-night run of Beethoven's Fidelio in March 2020 can host more than 13,000 people.
