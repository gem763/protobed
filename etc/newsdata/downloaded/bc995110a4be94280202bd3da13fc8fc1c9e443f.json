The 72-year-old recalled the Colorado gig, in which he was supposed to join the band just for a rendition of \u201cHonky Tonk Women.\u201d However, he ended up staying for the remainder of their set \u2014 while high on cocaine.\n\nELTON JOHN WRITES QUEEN ELIZABETH SLAPPED HER NEPHEW ACROSS THE FACE IN FRONT OF HIM IN NEW BOOK\n\nIn an excerpt recently published by UK\u2019s Daily Mail, John admitted that if he hadn't been under the influence, \u201cI might have just performed \u2018Honky Tonk Women,\u2019 waved to the crowd and made my exit.\u201d\n\nBut that's not how things went.\n\n\u201cI decided it was going so well, I\u2019d stay on and jam along to the rest of their set, without first taking the precaution of asking the Stones if they wanted an auxiliary keyboard player,\u201d wrote John. \u201cFor a while, I thought Keith Richards kept staring at me because he awestruck by the brilliance of my improvised contributions to their oeuvre.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter a few songs, it finally penetrated my brain that the expression on his face wasn\u2019t really suggestive of profound musical appreciation,\u201d added John.\n\nELTON JOHN RESPONDS TO VLADIMIR PUTIN\u2019S LGBTQ COMMENTS FOLLOWING \u2018ROCKETMAN\u2019 CENSORSHIP\n\nAccording to John, he \u201cquickly scuttled off, noting as I went that Keith was still staring at me in a manner that suggested we\u2019d be discussing this later, and decided it might be best if I didn\u2019t hang around for the after-show party.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there was something more to cocaine than the way it made me feel,\u201d he continued. \u201cCocaine had a certain cachet about it. It was fashionable and exclusive. Doing it was like becoming a member of an elite little clique that secretly indulged in something edgy, dangerous and illicit. Pathetically enough, that really appealed to me. I\u2019d become successful and popular, but I never felt cool.\u201d\n\nIn the autobiography, John shared that he finally checked into a Chicago hospital in 1990 in an effort toward \u201cbeing treated for three addictions at once: cocaine, alcohol and food.\u201d\n\nJohn not only made progress toward his sobriety, but he learned to do tasks that had fallen by the wayside due to his debilitating addictions.\n\nELTON JOHN REVEALS HIS MOST 'DIFFICULT' SCENES TO WATCH IN 'ROCKETMAN' BIOPIC\n\n\u201c[I] got to the stage where I shaved and I wiped my a\u2014, and paid other people to do everything else for me,\u201d wrote John. \u201cI had no idea how to work a washing machine and had to ask another patient, Peggy, to show me. After she realized I wasn\u2019t joking, she was helpful, but that didn\u2019t change the fact that I was a 43-year-old man who didn\u2019t know how to clean his own clothes.\u201d", "description": "Elton John admitted that his appearance at a 1975 Rolling Stones concert wasn\u2019t his finest hour.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/20/694940094001_6074786356001_6074785995001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
