First, tipping allows us to reward excellent service. Second, in a world of rising economic inequality, a 30 to 50 percent tip is a small but direct way to redistribute money to those who are working hard to earn a living.\n\nMoreover, tipping nurtures humane relationships. It encourages servers to try to establish social connection through direct eye contact and a display of warmth. Finally, most of the servers I\u2019ve known like the tipping system. They\u2019ve believed that by doing their job well they could earn far more than they could through a flat wage. That\u2019s certainly what I thought as a bartender.\n\nSo over all, I\u2019ve taken it as good news that tipping culture seems to be spreading to every cashier\u2019s counter in the land.\n\nBut if you look at the research you find that a lot of it doesn\u2019t buttress my priors. In the first place, the amount of a tip is rarely related to the quality of the service. Michael Lynn of Cornell, who is the leading scholar on the subject, finds that the quality of the service has a relatively small effect on tip size.", "description": "(You should still generally leave 30 percent.)", "authors": ["David Brooks"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/opinion/24brooksWeb/24brooksWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
