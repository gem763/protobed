I really think that\u2019s the most effective way about talking about a health topic and getting people to listen.\u201d\n\nRecently, Leslie\u2019s videos have been focusing on a more serious topic: vaping.\n\nIn a story first reported by Rolling Stone, the doctor was featured after she started sharing TikTok videos about the epidemic.\n\nIn one video that has over 600K views, Leslie shows a lung X-ray, explaining in detail how lungs look like for someone who vapes.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking about quitting, now\u2019s the time to do it,\u201d she says in the video.\n\nShe told \u201cGMA,\u201d \u201cI have been following all the reports on this new disease related to vaping and thought it would be really important for teens who are on TikTok to hear so I decided to take that information and spread it on TikTok in a palatable and easy to understand way.\u201d\n\nVaping-related illnesses in the U.S. has reached an all-time high more than two dozen deaths confirmed, and more than 1,000 lung injury cases associated with the use of e-cigarette products reported in 49 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nRecently, the CDC found that most patients with vaping-related illnesses report a history of using THC vaping-related products which suggest they were either obtained off the street or from other informal sources.\n\nSo far, the response to Leslie\u2019s videos has been overwhelmingly positive. And teens are taking note.\n\nMartin Wolk, a teen who follows Leslie on TikTok, was inspired to quit vaping after being an avid smoker for five years.\n\n\u201cI was scrolling through her videos and watching her vaping videos and it was really informative,\u201d Wolk told \u201cGMA.\u201d \u201cShe showed you damage to the lungs and I\u2019ve never really seen like X-ray photos of damage to people\u2019s lungs after vaping so it kind of scared me and I wanted to do something about it.\u201d\n\nLike many teens, Wolk started smoking in middle school after being drawn to the variety of flavors. He described how hard it was for him to quit, but how important it is for people like Leslie to use social media to reach youth about the issue.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of kids right now who are vaping and it\u2019s good to reach them through social media which they are always on,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been pretty surprised that a lot of followers are asking me pretty basic health questions,\u201d Leslie said. \u201cI really feel like continuing to make videos on TikTok will help address a lot of the questions that people have.\u201d\n\nAs the CDC continues to investigate vaping-related illnesses and lung-related injuries, Leslie said that getting information to teens is critical and doctors like her will start to use platforms like TikTok to reach them.\n\n\u201cAs time goes on it\u2019s just going to be more popular that medical professionals are using social media as a way to spread public health information and get connected to large groups of people,\u201d Leslie said.", "description": "Dr. Rose Marie Leslie, a resident at the University of Minnesota Medical School, uses TikTok to share medical facts and information about things like vaping.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/191017_gma_norman1_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
