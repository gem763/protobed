You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\u201d she thundered, holding back tears.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Time to wait\u2019 \u2013\n\nBut despite her impassioned wake-up calls, experts are sceptical she\u2019ll be honoured.\n\n\u201cExtremely unlikely,\u201d Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute in Oslo (Prio), told AFP, citing her young age and a lack of consensus on how climate change relates to armed conflict.\n\n\u201cThe only way I could see that happen is that she would be part of a shared prize like Malala,\u201d Urdal said, referring to Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai, who shared the 2014 prize \u2014 at age 17 \u2014 with Indian children\u2019s rights activist Kailash Satyarthi.\n\nLate Thursday, Norwegian broadcaster NRK put little faith in the idea, reporting that while \u201cbookmakers bet on Greta Thunberg, the Nobel Committee won\u2019t\u201d.\n\nNRK journalist Knut Magnus Berge also pointed out that even though her achievements are impressive, Greta is so young, \u201cthe Committee has time to wait\u201d.\n\nExperts think a more likely candidate would be Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who made peace with bitter foe Eritrea.\n\n\u201cAbiy Ahmed would be a good candidate, as his tenure has had peace-inducing effects in the country and on the region,\u201d said Peter Wallensteen, professor of Peace and Conflict Research at Sweden\u2019s Uppsala University.\n\nPredicting the winner is always a challenge since the Norwegian Nobel Committee never reveals the names of the nominees. All that is known is that a total of 301 individuals and organisations have been nominated this year.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Age of fake news\u2019 \u2013\n\nExperts also suggest that the five-person committee could this year decide to focus on freedom of expression and information, at a time when such freedoms are under pressure in both democracies and authoritarian regimes.\n\n\u201cIn the age of fake news and information overload\u2026 and the lack of transparency, the lack of accountability in many political processes, this is something that I would hope the committee would take very seriously and consider,\u201d Urdal said.\n\nPress organisations such as Reporters Without Borders (RSF) or the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) could then be possible winners.\n\nAs the migration crisis continues to dominate the political agenda, the UN refugee agency UNHCR and its head Filippo Grandi, as well as the organisation SOS Mediterranee, are also seen as potential winners.\n\nBroadly considered a controversial long shot, US President Donald Trump has nonetheless been mentioned for his efforts to mend old wounds with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nLast year, the award \u2014 consisting of a gold medal, a diploma, and nine million Swedish kronor (around $912,000 or 828,000 euro) \u2014 was given to two champions fighting sexual violence, Congolese gynaecologist Denis Mukwege and Yazidi activist Nadia Murad.\n\nOn Thursday, the Swedish Academy in Stockholm gave the 2019 Nobel Literature Prize to Austrian author Peter Handke.\n\nThe 2018 prize, which the Academy had postponed in the wake of a sexual harassment scandal, was awarded to Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk.\n\nThe Economics Prize will wrap up the 2019 Nobel prize season on October 14.", "description": "Oslo (AFP) \u2013 Bookies have Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg as the name to beat ahead of Friday\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize announcement,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/ccf75f_greta-thunberg-is-bookies-top-bet-nobel-peace-prize-but-experts-are-sceptical-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
