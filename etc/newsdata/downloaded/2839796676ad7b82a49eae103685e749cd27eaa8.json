In the decades since, scientists have found thousands more of these exoplanets, and astronomers now think our universe contains more planets than stars.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s Nobel laureates in physics have painted a picture of a universe far stranger and more wonderful than we ever could have imagined,\u201d Ulf Danielsson, a Nobel committee member, said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cOur view of our place in the universe will never be the same again.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Sarah Kaplan", "Reporter For Speaking Of Science", "October At Am", "Sarah Kaplan Is A Science Reporter Covering News Around The Nation", "Across The Universe.
