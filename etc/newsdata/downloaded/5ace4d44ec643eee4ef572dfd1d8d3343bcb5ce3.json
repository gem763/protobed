He also had bruises all over his body, including in both his eyes, consistent with physical abuse, reported The Spokesman-Review.\n\nA medical examiner ruled the child\u2019s manner of death as a homicide.\n\nErik Sherman was arrested a little over a week later, accused of savagely beating his son, according to court filings.\n\nBaby Emmett's mother, who has not been charged with any crime, told police that on August 5, she woke up from a nap to find her son bleeding from his mouth in the bathroom.\n\nSherman, who was looking after the baby at the time, claimed that the infant suddenly rocked his head and struck his mouth on Sherman's shoulder, resulting in the injury.\n\nEmmett's lip was so badly ripped that he could not feed properly, but despite that his parents did not take him to the hospital at the time.\n\nInstead, they tried to look up his symptoms using Google search, according to court papers.\n\nEmmett stopped breathing on August 7, 2018, while being burped by Sherman on the back patio of their home in Spokane, Washington (pictured)\n\nText message exchanges between Sherman and his girlfriend that were later obtained by investigators revealed that Emmett's mother told her boyfriend they should take the baby to the doctor, but Sherman allegedly replied that the child just needed food and 'a warm rag on his head.'\n\nIt was not until two days later, when Emmett topped breathing while being buried by Sherman on the back patio of their home, that the parents finally sought medical attention for the infant.\n\nEmmett was unresponsive when he was brought to the hospital, and he was taken off life support on August 10.\n\nWhen interviewed by police, Sherman denied knowing how his son sustained his numerous injuries.\n\nThe station KHQ reported that Sherman's 15-year-old daughter from a previous relationship later told police that on July 31, she was in her bedroom located directly across from the nursery when she heard her father yelling at the newborn baby that 'he didn\u2019t like his attitude' and that 'he didn\u2019t care how old he is. He needs to stop crying.'\n\nThe teen said her father went on berating the infant for 45 minutes.\n\nUnder his plea agreement, Sherman will be sentenced on November 15 to more than 26 years in prison.", "description": "Erik Sherman, from Washington, has pleaded guilty to homicide by abuse in the August 2018 beating death of his son, Emmett, who suffered a fatal brain injury, broken bones and a torn lip.", "authors": ["Snejana Farberov For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/17/19451268-0-image-a-56_1570553728174.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
