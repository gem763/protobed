Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.\n\nHere\u2019s an intriguing question from UndercoverOps, who has been re-reading \u201cmy favourite book from childhood\u201d, The Hounds of the Morrigan by Pat O\u2019Shea:\n\nIt\u2019s not a book I\u2019ve heard much about since, did it never make it on to the classics list? I have been very much enjoying its humour and magic again as an adult decades later. It seems to have all the key elements of a children\u2019s adventure - magic, peril, a quest, no parents. It even starts in a secondhand bookshop!\n\nA more grown-up form of innocence for Malinkibear, who has been reading Edith Wharton:\n\nFinished The Age of Innocence yesterday. I picked it up on a whim, as a book I\u2019d heard of but knew nothing about, and it fit into my \u201cread more books not written by straight cis white men\u201d resolution. (Somewhat) surprisingly enjoyed it, I felt it was a nuanced critique on high society and the inequality in permissiveness between the sexes - an inequality that remains today.\n\nKevin Barry\u2019s Booker longlisted Night Boat To Tangier has impressed allworthy:\n\nHell, he can he write. Wonderful descriptions of place and he can capture a character in a few breathtaking brushstrokes. I\u2019m still not sure about its form which he seems to wrestle with at times. That could be me but well worth reading.\n\nAlexia_R has finished Paula Chiziane\u2019s The First Wife, translated from the Portuguese by David Brookshaw:\n\nApparently the first book by a Mozambican woman to be translated into English. Parts of this are bitingly funny, other parts terribly sad. The story meanders around a bit and is pretty long but it reads so smoothly, I didn\u2019t mind, and I learnt something about the north/south divide in Mozambique and some regional cultural/sexual practices that were completely new to me \u2026 I\u2019m going to be thinking about it for a while to come, I think.\n\nWebberExpat says that Zola\u2019s Germinal is rightly \u201creputed as a masterpiece\u201d:\n\nIt\u2019s a book that feels urgent, like Urban Sinclair\u2019s The Jungle and Steinbeck\u2019s The Grapes Of Wrath, Germinal seems to be a book that is screaming at us today. It has a lot to say about what happens when the many have the fewest resources and when revolution fails to bring the promised cornucopiae, the people will swing blindly and viciously. If you have no hope of every climbing out of the coal heap and warming your hands and filling your stomach, losing your life seems paltry and preordained. It also has a lot to say about how easy it is for the well-meaning idiot to cobble together a philosophy to harness that rage (and let\u2019s not get onto the fucking nefarious idiots that we\u2019re staring down today).\n\nThe Makioka Sisters by Jun\u2019ichir\u014d Tanizaki has kept LeoToadstool busy:\n\nConsidered one of the greatest Japanese novels of the 20th century, it\u2019s a family epic centred on the lives of four sisters of an upper-middle class family in late-1930s Osaka. It has a bit of a Russian feel to it, reminiscent not of Anna Karenina (slyly referenced in the text) but of Chekhov, in its chronicling of the experiences and little dramas of family life: illnesses, excursions to shrines, visits to Tokyo, marriage proposals, migrations, etc. Not the most action-packed book ever written, but still worth persisting with. Edward Seidensticker\u2019s translation, dating from 1957, reads decently, if a little flat, and is often hilarious in its datedness (he devotes a footnote to explaining what \u201csushi\u201d is, for instance).\n\nFatFreddyCat has also been reading about Japan, in Another Kyoto by Alex Kerr:\n\nKerr has spent several decades in this remarkable city and the book originated in aimless wanderings around Kyoto with a friend during which they would discursively and at length talk around various things that caught their eye as they went. It suffers slightly from the pretentious over-solemnity that Americans in particular can bring to living in Japan, but that small criticism aside, it\u2019s a fascinating book.\n\nFinally, The Anatomy of Melancholy by Robert Burton has provided a wealth of useful material for Elias_Artifex:\n\nOstensibly a study into the causes and treatment of melancholy (corresponding very roughly to what we would call depression) it is a actually a pretty free-ranging review of theoretical understand (cosmological, physiological and psychological) as it stood when the book was written (1621). Dr Johnson said that it was the only book that ever took him out of bed two hours sooner than he wished to rise. I keep a copy of The Anatomy by my bed and often read a few pages to calm the mind - something about the writing has this effect. One bit that never fails to lift my spirits is the section on laxatives (very comprehensive), the application of which arises from the Galenic/Hippocratic notion that melancholy (an excess of black bile) can be relieved by purging. The idea that depression can be lifted simply by a good clear-out is very appealing somehow.\n\nNot even somehow.\n\nInteresting links about books and reading\n\nIf you\u2019re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #GuardianBooks, and we\u2019ll include a selection in this blog.
