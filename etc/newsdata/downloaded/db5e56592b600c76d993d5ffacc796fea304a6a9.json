Navarro, meanwhile, implied the story was false because CNN was relying on \u201canonymous sources.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou assert that\u2014that\u2019s not a fact in evidence,\u201d Navarro exclaimed. \u201cI read through that whole story. It was one assertion of fact after another, without sourcing.\u201d\n\nAfter Sciutto defended the reporting, noting there were multiple sources and public information corroborating the story, he continued to question Navarro about Trump not taking sides in the Hong Kong protests, noting that the president\u2019s trade adviser himself has praised the protesters.\n\n\u201cHe said very clearly he wanted a peaceful resolution to that,\u201d Navarro declared, prompting Sciutto to once again state that Trump merely said he wanted \u201cboth sides to refrain from violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the point here, Jim?\u201d Navarro snapped back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking you, are you disappointed the president hasn\u2019t made a public statement of support,\u201d the CNN host wondered aloud.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never disappointed in my president,\u201d the Trump aide declared. \u201cI\u2019m never disappointed in my president!\u201d\n\nTowards the end of the segment, after Navarro repeatedly compared him to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (a favorite target of Trumpworld\u2019s lately), Sciutto circled back to the president calling on the Chinese government to investigate the Biden family.\n\n\u201cHave you ever raised investigating Joe Biden or his son during contacts with Chinese officials?\u201d Sciutto asked.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d the White House official responded. \u201cI will never talk about what happens inside the White House. OK? Not confirm or deny. Because that\u2019s the slippery slope.\u201d\n\nNavarro would go on and deflect some more as Sciutto attempted to get a yes-no answer from him, complaining about leaks from the White House and anonymous sources in reports on the administration.", "description": "\u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d Navarro said, \u201cI will never talk about what happens inside the White House.
