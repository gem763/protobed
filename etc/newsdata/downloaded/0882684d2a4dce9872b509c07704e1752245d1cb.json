Millions of its citizens have emigrated in search of work after a cycle of crises stoked an inflation rate that peaked in 2008 at 79.6 billion percent.\n\nThe country\u2019s economy is again on a precipice. With the budget deficit ballooning to 10% of gross domestic product, U.S. dollars\u2014Zimbabwe\u2019s effective currency\u2014are in such scarce circulation that people have begun sleeping outside banks.\n\n\u201cMacroeconomic stability is threatened by high government spending, the foreign-exchange regime is untenable, and the pace of reform inadequate,\u201d said Gene Leon, the IMF\u2019s Zimbabwe mission chief.\n\nThe country\u2019s stubborn state of economic emergency marks a spectacular decline from when Robert Mugabe took its helm in 1980, ending white-minority rule after years of armed struggle amid widespread jubilation. His first 15 years in power were broadly reformist, characterized by consensus building and large investments in education and infrastructure. In those years the economy continued to expand.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, when many other African nations were grappling with famine and conflict, Zimbabwe was the second-most industrialized nation in sub-Saharan Africa and one of its only net grain exporters, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, a United Nations body. A growing manufacturing base and an increasingly healthy and better-educated population showcased the country\u2019s economic ascent.\n\nBut in the late 1990s, Mr. Mugabe launched a set of new policies to nationalize and redistribute land\u2014ostensibly to correct colonial-era inequalities that benefited white farmers\u2014and to greatly increase state-funded payouts to his political constituency. The approach triggered a collapse in the country\u2019s economic output. By the early 2000s, production of tobacco, the country\u2019s top export, had begun to plummet in the wake of the land reforms, and it still hasn\u2019t fully recovered.\n\nAs the ramifications of the land redistribution and gross government overspending worked through the economy, child mortality skyrocketed and life expectancy plummeted amid an HIV/AIDS pandemic. Millions became poorer. The land program also tore through bank balance sheets as land held as collateral for loans was rendered largely worthless.\n\n\u201cThe biggest of the government\u2019s faults is that they took the land off the market. That market value used to support loans and businesses,\u201d said John Robertson, a Harare-based economist.\n\nThat will be no easy matter to reverse, but taming the country\u2019s leviathan state apparatus may well prove even harder, Mr. Robertson suggests.\n\nCiting official labor-force data, he says some one million people were in full-time employment in the 1990s, 10% in government jobs. Today, only 800,000 are fully employed in the formal economy, and 300,000 of them work for the state. Separately, another 200,000 people are war veterans and others receiving state pensions.\n\nGovernment wages and salaries consumed nearly 70% of state revenues last year, the IMF said, a share about three times the average on the continent. That could make cutting public spending a tall order for Mr. Mugabe\u2019s successor.\n\nAn IMF bailout could be one option for Zimbabwe, but it can only be requested once the government clears arrears totalling some $9 billion with the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank. Any such arrangement would also require Zimbabwe to agree to a raft of painful policy reforms and negotiate debt restructuring with its lenders.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a government on earth that can claim it has more power than the market,\u201d Mr. Robertson said. \u201cWe need to fix what we did wrong.\u201d\n\nPeople going about their business in Harare\u2019s central business district on Nov. 16, a day after the Zimbabwe Defense Forces seized power in the country.
