Hogan makes a \u2018final\u2019 offer of $200 million to settle lawsuit involving historically black schools", "language": "en", "text": "Read Gov. Hogan's full letter here\n\nIn a letter to Del. Darryl Barnes (D-Prince George\u2019s), who chairs the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland, Hogan\u2019s chief counsel Robert F. Scholz said the governor is prepared to make a \u201cfinal\u201d offer to resolve the case of up to $200 million in funds over a 10-year period beginning in fiscal 2021.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA settlement on this basis would remove the very substantial litigation risk that the plaintiffs now face, and is more than what the plaintiffs would likely achieve even if successful someday at the end of the litigation,\u201d Scholz wrote. \u201cWe ask for your leadership to help facilitate a practical, fair and just outcome.\"\n\nMaryland offers $100 million to settle decade-long case involving historically black schools\n\nBarnes, who weeks ago invited Hogan and other stakeholders to meet and go over the $577 million proposal, said he never received a response from the governor and was disappointed in his strategy.\n\n\u201cTo say this is my final demand without having conversation and dialogue, at least with the Maryland Legislative Black Caucus \u2026 is not a move that shows good faith in the process,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cThe number is extremely low.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe delegate said the offer is well below the $1 billion estimates of what it would cost to bring parity to the state\u2019s historically black institutions. Barnes also pointed out that the alumni coalition is asking for less than Mississippi paid when accounting for inflation, in a similar case, which was settled for more than $500 million in 2002.\n\nAD\n\nThe graduates from Morgan State University, Coppin State University, Bowie State University and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore sued Maryland in 2006 for underfunding and undermining the academic programs at those schools.\n\nMaryland leaders have over the years acknowledged the state\u2019s troubled history of segregation in higher education but have argued that increased financial support to the four universities has largely remedied the problem \u2014 sentiments echoed in the latest settlement offer.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is critical that any resolution of this case recognizes the significant strides made by the State of Maryland to remedy these historic inequities,\u201d Scholz wrote. \u201cMaryland has expanded the roles and missions of Maryland\u2019s HBCUs, increasing both their operating and capital funding.\u201d\n\nScholz said that over the past two decades, the state has invested more than $1.5 billion in its four historically black colleges. In addition, he said, Maryland is facing a $5 billion cash shortfall between fiscal 2021 and 2024 and has many \u201cworthy demands\u201d on available funds.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s offer of $200 million shows that it is still not serious about remedying a constitutional violation,\u201d said Michael D. Jones, an attorney for the coalition. \u201cIn court, the question will be a constitutional one; what is necessary to remedy the violation. It will not be a political question of how one governor\u2019s inadequate remedy compared to his predecessor\u2019s inadequate offer.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe alumni coalition has argued that their schools are placed at a disadvantage when their most distinctive offerings are duplicated, especially when the schools they compete with have more money and newer facilities. They say that introducing more academic programs that are in high demand would enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of the four schools.\n\nScholz said the state has taken \u201cpositive steps to address program duplication,\u201d but then went on to diminish the importance of schools having academic specialties.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSchool size and location are arguably more significant than specific program offerings, which are putatively at issue in the litigation,\u201d Scholz wrote. \u201cRobust out-of-state online competition made program duplication on geographically close campuses an increasingly less relevant concept in higher\u201d education.\n\nA federal judge in 2017 ordered Maryland to end the disparity by establishing a set of unique programs at each school and providing additional funding for marketing and scholarships. The state appealed the decision and was ordered into mediation that ended in July without a resolution.\n\nAD", "description": "The latest offer is double the amount the state proposed last year, but less than half of what alumni of the four public universities are seeking.", "authors": ["Danielle Douglas-Gabriel", "Reporter Covering The Economics Of Education"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zzuEN5APRnM9sgfM-IEmKQp7oRM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O6PCIVWQAQI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
