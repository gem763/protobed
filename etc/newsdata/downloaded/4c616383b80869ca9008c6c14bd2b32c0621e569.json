Disappointment that we're letting down our partners, perhaps adding to the humanitarian disaster in this region, and that we may be ceding a hard-won strategic advantage to play a role in what is admittedly turning into a lengthy and difficult process to bringing a political solution to this troubled area,\u201d retired Gen. Joseph Votel, who was commander of U.S. Central Command until his retirement in March, said at an Atlantic Council event Tuesday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI believe that partnership is important. This partnership certainly is,\u201d he added later. \u201cIt must however be nourished frequently and be based completely on mutual trust. I do believe yesterday\u2019s policy shift will make it more difficult to build partnerships in the future.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his remarks at the Atlantic Council, Votel also co-wrote an op-ed for the Atlantic with Middle East Institute nonresident fellow Elizabeth Dent in which they warned that Trump\u2019s move \u201cthreatens to undo five years\u2019 worth of fighting against ISIS and will severely damage American credibility and reliability in any future fights where we need strong allies.\u201d\n\nVotel\u2019s comments add to a chorus of criticism following Trump\u2019s decision, announced by the White House late Sunday, to move U.S. troops in northeast Syria out of the way of a long threatened Turkish incursion against Syrian Kurdish forces.\n\nTrump has defended his decision by saying that it is time to end U.S. involvement in \"ridiculous Endless Wars\u201d and defending Turkey as a NATO ally.\n\nBut lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, including many of Trump\u2019s typical Republican allies, have criticized the move as abandoning the Kurds, who were instrumental in the fight against ISIS, to be slaughtered by Turkey.\n\nThe Kurds lead the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that the United States relied on as the main ground force fighting ISIS. But Ankara considers the Kurds terrorists connected to a Kurdish insurgency inside Turkey.\n\nOn Tuesday, Votel highlighted the more than 11,000 casualties the SDF suffered fighting ISIS on the U.S.-led coalition\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cIn my humble opinion, they are a capable and trustworthy partner, and did everything we asked them to do even when it was not something that they necessarily wanted,\u201d Votel said. \u201cBeyond that, they protected us every day. Their dedication to the fight and to our partnership was always evident to me.\u201d\n\nIn order to assuage Turkish concerns about Kurdish forces near the Syria-Turkey border, the United States had been working with Turkey to set up a safe zone along the border, an effort that U.S. military was touting as recently as Saturday.\n\nVotel said the safe zone offered the best solution even though it did not completely satisfy every party.\n\n\u201cI do believe the approach we were taking with increased security mechanisms in the border area was moving this in a steady, albeit slow, but a satisfactory overall direction, although I also understand that no one party would ever be completely satisfied with the solution or the speed in attaining it,\u201d he said.\n\nVotel also called the U.S. partnership with the SDF a \u201cmodel\u201d for how to handle a complex environment such as Syria.\n\n\u201cI have long held that the partnership we have crafted with the Syrian Democratic Forces is a model of how we should be protecting our interests in these very complex areas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gave us a way to do what we do best as Americans \u2014 convene, collaborate, team-build, understand, focus, enable and advise \u2014 while minimizing our footprint and keeping the ownership of the solution on the ground in local hands.\u201d", "description": "The former commander of U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/josephvotel032016getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
