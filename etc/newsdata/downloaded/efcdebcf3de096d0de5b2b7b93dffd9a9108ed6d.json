Was the wait worth it? Yes.\n\nAt the start of the event, the only available mode was a team fight called \u201cThe End.\u201d In my match, players clustered around Dusty Depot\u2019s rocket. At the end of the countdown, the rocket launched into the sky and cracked it. Pieces fell off, with bright blue capsules circling around the map. A capsule with a bright red line fell from a crack above Loot Lake, causing an explosion that launched players into the sky.\n\nThe bubble around Loot Lake glowed and flickered, and a meteor surrounded by capsules fell onto it. As I watched, familiar items like tomato heads and the battle bus were sucked into the explosion, including, eventually, the entire map itself. I was left with only a dark screen with a wormhole in the middle and the option to exit. When I logged out and tried to log back in, the game asked me to log into my Epic account. After attempting to load for a while, I was told my login failed. After a few more tries, my game logged in, but I was taken back to the black hole.\n\nCurrently, the Fortnite website is just a blank Twitch stream. The logo on the game in my Epic library is just the wormhole, and Fortnite\u2019s Twitter logo is just black. Streams of the game show the black wormhole screen. The status page reads \u201canomaly detected\u201d on all services except the Epic store.\n\nThe event has been teased for weeks, as the Visitor\u2019s rocket steadily being built in the returned location of Dusty Depot. The Visitor showed up in Season 3\u2019s meteor and, this season, has been considered responsible for the time distortions that have brought old areas of Fortnite\u2019s world back to the map. The game\u2019s overtime challenges had players finding voice recordings of the Visitor, talking about time loops, \u201cthe formation of the island,\u201d and \u201cthe end.\u201d Developer Epic has gotten in on this apocalyptic vibe, tweeting that \u201cthe end is near\u201d and making the unusual decision to have the next season start immediately following the event, instead of the standard few days later. Along with leaks suggesting the next season will be Fortnite\u2019s \u201cchapter 2\u201d and dataminers finding a host of new place names, players were expecting something cataclysmic, and that\u2019s certainly what they got.\n\nFortnite\u2019s Season 10 was polarising, with unpopular additions and a divided community. I\u2019m pretty sure everyone is ready for a change, but I have no idea what it will be. Looks like I\u2019ll be spending the rest of my Sunday sitting in front of my computer waiting to see what\u2019s next.\n\nThe numbers 11, 146, 15, and 62 were occasionally appearing above the black hole. Eleven makes sense for the new season, but what about the rest? The official PlayStation support Twitter then reminded players that their V-Bucks and items are OK.\n\nEpic is aware of the Fortnite Blackout. Please be assured that your inventory items and V-Bucks are secure. Please reach out to Epic for more details. \u2014 Ask PlayStation (@AskPlayStation) October 13, 2019\n\nEsports consultant Rod Breslau is citing some pretty huge viewership numbers for the event.\n\nFortnite's 'The End' event will go down as the most watched gaming event in history for western audiences 4.5M+ on YouTube\n\n1.5M+ on Twitch\n\n1M+ on Twitter\n\nand 37 people on Mixer just incredible \u2014 Rod Breslau (@Slasher) October 13, 2019\n\nFortnite's Season 10 Has Been Extended A Week Fortnite Season 10 has been extended and will end on October 14. You\u2019ll have another week to complete your challenges, but you\u2019ll also have another week of dealing with the chaos this season has brought.

Some players are correlating the numbers to the Visitor\u2019s audio logs and suggesting it spells out \u201cI was not alone. Others were outside the loop.\u201d So far, one Fortnite leaker is suggesting the downtime could last until Tuesday, based on things they\u2019ve found in the game\u2019s webpage code.
