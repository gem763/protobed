(CSE: SPR) (OTCQB: SRUTF) (FSE: 38G) (\u201cSproutly\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is pleased to provide an update on: 1) its previously announced joint venture with OCC Holdings Ltd., an affiliate of Moosehead Breweries Limited (\u201cMoosehead\u201d) (the \u201cJoint Venture\u201d or, the \u201cJV\u201d); and, 2) in respect of progress made to-date in the development of cannabis-infused beverages intended for sale in the Canadian market via Toronto Herbal Remedies Inc. (\u201cTHR\u201d), Sproutly\u2019s Health Canada licensed cannabis producer (the \u201cInfused Beverages\u201d).\n\n\u201cIn the past five months, significant resources have been dedicated towards creating a portfolio of Infused Beverages that will be ready for consumers following legalization in Canada.\u201d said Matthew Oland, CEO of the Joint Venture. \u201cOn May 1, 2019, I took over the leadership of the initiative. To date, we have made significant strides in developing the brand strategy, products, packaging, manufacturing, and logistics for the Infused Beverages. I am confident in our ability to deliver a great tasting beverage to Canadians that provides a controlled, strain specific, cannabis experience utilizing Sproutly\u2019s naturally water soluble cannabinoids known as Infuz 2 0. Infuz 2 0 has proven to deliver the cannabis effects in less than 5 minutes with the experience lasting up to 90 minutes, as advertised. We are eager to bring our beverages to market showcasing the finished Infused Beverages utilizing such a truly unique technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough the legal framework of the Joint Venture has taken longer than expected, both Moosehead and Sproutly have allocated significant resources to the Joint Venture since the announcement in May 2019. As a result, there has been substantial progress made on the business and product development of Infused Beverages. With Matthew\u2019s extensive leadership and experience in the beverage category, we are well down the path on branding and formulating beverages. APP Technology has given us the ability to fast-track our beverage development process as we do not have the same technology and formulation challenges as processes that require chemical formulation on extracted cannabis oils.\u201d said Keith Dolo, Sproutly\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. \u201cWe look forward to completing the remaining legal documents to implement the Joint Venture and to announcing the name of the Joint Venture.\u201d\n\nMatthew Oland, one of Moosehead\u2019s senior executives and Oland family member, has relinquished his former responsibilities at Moosehead to assume the role of Chief Executive Officer of the Joint Venture as of May 1, 2019. Moosehead has assigned additional staff and resources to support Mr. Oland in the development and operation of the Joint Venture.\n\nThe Infused Beverages will initially target the casual and canna-curious consumer with a premium beverage product that is a non-smokable cannabis alternative to traditional edibles and beverages that have inherent onset and offset challenges. With Sproutly\u2019s Infuz 2 O and Moosehead\u2019s adult beverage formulation expertise, the JV\u2019s Infused Beverages will deliver a great taste profile with little to no cannabis aroma or flavour impact. In addition to the desirable flavour and aroma characteristics, Infuz 2 O provides several other attractive formulation and experience benefits as compared to traditional oil-based beverage solutions, including:\n\nalmost instant cannabis experience onset of 5 minutes or less (vs. 30+ minutes for traditional oil-based emulsion and nano-encapsulation technologies);\n\nefficient and controllable cannabis experience offset of 60-90 minutes (vs. 2+ hours for traditional oil-based emulsion and nano-encapsulation technologies);\n\nall-natural water-soluble cannabis extract without the use of chemicals or detergents as used in emulsion and nano-encapsulation technologies;\n\nwhole plant extract with strain-specific features, allowing the ability to create beverages and edibles that deliver the strain experience without smoking the flower; and,\n\nwhen infused in beverages, the lack of pronounced cannabis taste, aroma, or sediment.\n\nJoint Venture Business Development Highlights\n\nSproutly and Moosehead, in its capacity as a branding, marketing, and logistics partner, have significantly progressed the business of the Joint Venture since the signing of the JV Agreement on April 30, 2019. Select Joint Venture business development highlights are outlined below:\n\nBrand Development Leveraged Moosehead\u2019s existing relationship with an award-winning branding & design agency to develop a brand name, logo, identity and architecture as well as a strategy for positioning the Joint Venture in the market. Created a corporate name and secured corresponding website domains and commenced website development.\n\n\n\nProduct Development Utilized Moosehead\u2019s product development experience and relationship with a leading global flavour and ingredient solutions company to lead the beverage base formulation. Completed several rounds of product formulation testing, including: testing of beverage base to determine desired flavor profiles, sweetness, colour, and calorie targets; exploring an array of THC mg dosages utilizing Infuz2O; and, utilizing both Indica and Sativa cannabis strains to determine desired strain-specific characteristics. Evaluated numerous packaging (bottles and cans) and labeling options. Engaged a third-party market research firm to help refine product development and branding through consumer research and product concept testing to explore end-user preferences.\n\n\n\nGo-To-Market Strategy Completed an initial round of presentations to provincial cannabis regulatory agencies and a selection of private retailers to identify and assess initial launch markets.

In collaboration with a top-tier brand and marketing agency, commenced preliminary planning for a marketing strategy including a strategy for potential in-store activation, education, communication and merchandising.\n\n\n\nManufacturing, Logistics & Operations Determined that THR will utilize third-party contract manufacturers (co-packers) for the manufacturing of its initial products due to the Health Canada regulations requiring the segregation of cannabis-infused beverages from alcoholic beverage production. Assessed potential co-packers for the manufacture of initial products and commenced discussions with preferred providers.

The parties continue to work diligently to complete the Implementation Documents.\n\nAbout Moosehead Breweries Ltd.\n\nIn 1867, the Oland family \u2013 led by matriarch Susannah Oland \u2013 began brewing and selling October Brown Ale on the family farm located on the Dartmouth shore of the Halifax Harbour. What started as a small brewery, grew with grit and determination throughout time as the commitment to brewing quality beer passed on from generation to generation. Located in Saint John, New Brunswick, Moosehead is the last major brewery in Canada owned by Canadians. Now in its sixth generation of ownership, the Oland family\u2019s passion for beer has helped them steer Moosehead through devastating fires, Prohibition, the Great Depression, two world wars, obstructive trade barriers, and bruising competition from breweries 100 times its size. As Canada\u2019s oldest and largest independent brewer, the company stands committed to the same values that transformed a small brewery in Saint John, NB into a Canadian icon of resilience. Moosehead sells its beer throughout Canada, the United States and in 15 other countries around the world under its 14 wholly owned and 8 partner brands.\n\nAbout Sproutly Canada, Inc.\n\nSproutly\u2019s core mission is to become the leading supplier to the cannabis beverage and edibles market.
