Earlier, the company predicted those sales would increase 3% to 6% over three to five years.\n\nDomino's faces heightened competition for diners as a broader set of competitors start offering food via third-party delivery companies, often at cheap prices.\n\nMcDonald's Corp., for example, has struck delivery deals with DoorDash Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. 's Uber Eats. In August, Panera Bread said it would work with those two services, as well as Grubhub Inc.\n\nDomino's on Tuesday reported $820.8 million in revenue for its fiscal third quarter ended Sept. 8, up about 4% compared with last year but weaker than predictions from Wall Street analysts, according to FactSet.\n\nSame-store sales grew 2.4% in the U.S. in the quarter compared with a year earlier.\n\nShares of Domino's fell about 6% in premarket trading.\n\nThe Ann Arbor, Mich.-based company reported a profit of $86.4 million, or $2.05 a share, in the latest quarter, compared with earnings of $84.1 million, or $1.95, a year earlier.\n\nDomino's adjusted profit, also $2.05 a share, missed expectations by 2 cents.\n\nWrite to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 08, 2019 08:29 ET (12:29 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
