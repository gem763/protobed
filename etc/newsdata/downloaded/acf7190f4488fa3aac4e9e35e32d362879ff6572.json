He added: \u201cEverything about United was lacklustre. No quality. A lack of desire. A lack of leaders. It\u2019s a long way back for them.\u201d\n\nAaron Cresswell seals victory for West Ham over toothless Manchester United Read more\n\nSolskj\u00e6r, who reported that Marcus Rashford would \u201cprobably be out for a little while\u201d with the groin injury that forced him off, argued it was a game of fine margins in which West Ham took their chances and United did not.\n\n\u201cThis group wants to do what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cThere are key moments in games that can tip them in our favour or theirs \u2013 maybe you make a bad decision on a pass \u2013 but the attitude and desire is there. That\u2019s not the problem. It\u2019s the quality in our decision-making, in the execution sometimes. We are going to hit some bumps along the road, some highs and lows. This group is out there determined. It was a good atmosphere in the dressing-room. They\u2019ve got the focus right.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t create enough chances but we created big chances \u2013 some big moments that we didn\u2019t take. They didn\u2019t create too many, either but they scored on theirs. It was a game that could have gone both ways. We had a few moments in the first half when we turned down a key pass and, of course, we had the two chances in the second half [through Juan Mata and Harry Maguire]. If we had those again, I\u2019m sure we\u2019d score more than we miss.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r says Marcus Rashford will \u2018probably be out for a little while\u2019 after being forced off at West Ham with a groin injury.

With Romelu Lukaku and Alexis S\u00e1nchez moved on to Internazionale over the summer, the last thing Solskj\u00e6r needed was an injury to Rashford. He had to bring on Jesse Lingard as a makeshift striker.\n\n\u201cWe have to scan him [Rashford] tomorrow,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cHopefully Mason and Anthony will be back for Arsenal [on Monday week] and one of them for Rochdale [in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday].\u201d", "description": "Manchester United\u2019s Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r said there was nothing wrong with his players\u2019 \u2018attitude and desire\u2019 after his side\u2019s 2-0 defeat at West Ham", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8895a19483af4d9859b1b27ffd037fedd703dcc8/0_113_3400_2039/master/3400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=009654a42e499abd0eaca9c00805e991", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
