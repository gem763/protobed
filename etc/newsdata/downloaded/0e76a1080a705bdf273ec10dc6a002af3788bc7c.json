Matt Zapotsky examines how Attorney General William Barr fits into the impeachment inquiry. And Anne Midgette remembers opera singer Jessye Norman.\n\nPost Reports is the daily podcast from The Washington Post. Unparalleled reporting. Expert insight. Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nHow Uber\u2019s investigations unit works to limit the company\u2019s liability\n\nArmed with little more than phone headsets and GPS ride data, a team of less than 100 workers is tasked with managing some of the worst incidents that happen in Uber rides.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when they make a determination, Special Investigations Unit staffers are forbidden from routing allegations to police or advising victims to seek outside legal counsel. Instead, they\u2019re coached by Uber to act in the company\u2019s interest ahead of passenger safety, according to 20 current and former investigators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA lot of investigators can remember one or two or five different times where they made the recommendation that enough allegations have come in that this person should not be on Uber anymore, and a manager overturned it for one reason or another,\u201d says technology reporter Greg Bensinger\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018This is another data point of him fitting into Trump\u2019s desires to spark investigations\u2019\n\nAttorney General William Barr has held private meetings overseas with foreign intelligence officials, seeking their help with a Justice Department investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe of the 2016 election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re learning now is that Bill Barr has personally inserted himself into this,\u201d says national security reporter Matt Zapotsky . \u201cHe is taking trips abroad to press his foreign counterparts to help investigate the investigators.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBarr\u2019s active role underscores the degree to which a nearly three-year-old election still consumes significant resources and attention inside the federal government. His personal involvement may also provide fuel for those pursuing impeachment, as the administration uses executive branch powers to augment investigations aimed at the president\u2019s adversaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need foreign countries\u2019 help with investigations sometimes,\u201d Zapotsky says. \u201cBut there\u2019s a process that works on a much lower level to make sure that happens. The attorney general personally going over and getting involved is pretty weird.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe great American soprano, Jessye Norman\n\n\u201cJessye Norman truly had the presence of a diva,\u201d says music critic Anne Midgette . \u201cShe had this incredibly beautiful face, and she could open her mouth and just unleash floods of sound.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Grammy-winning soprano was a towering figure on the operatic stage. She died Monday at 74, after decades as a pioneering African American musician onstage.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Greg Bensinger on Uber\u2019s company-centric safety policies.
