So, when they meet, they sometimes decide to change the federal funds rate, or the interest rate that banks charge each other for loans. This interest rate influences all the rest \u2014 when it's cut, borrowing becomes cheaper and saving becomes less lucrative to encourage spending.\n\nAfter years of steadily raising rates to slow the rebound from the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve voted to lower the federal funds rate again to between 1.75% to 2% during their September meeting on Wednesday. This will be the second cut this year, following the first in July.\n\nGreg McBride, chief financial officer at Bankrate, told Business Insider in July that the cut was likely to spur growth.\n\n\"The Fed is trying to put some oil in the gears of the economy,\" McBride said. \"The economy's in good shape now, but there are concerns about slower economic growth overseas as well as trade due to tariffs that could act as an anchor.\"\n\nBut a rate cut doesn't mean that there will be huge changes overnight. All they're doing, McBride said, is \"walking back to the last increase they made in December.\"\n\nRate cuts benefit borrowers, not so much savers\n\nBorrowers and savers will each see the changes differently.\n\n\"When interest rates go down, consumers will typically see a similar decrease in credit card rates, home equity lines of credit, variable rate student loans, and small business loans,\" McBride said. \"For savers, it will translate to lower returns on savings accounts and CDs.\"\n\nBut, you may not notice the change exactly reflected. \"Credit card rates and home equity lines of credit are benchmarked to the prime rate, which moves in concert with the Federal Funds rate. So, when the Fed cuts rates by 0.25%, the prime rate also goes down by 0.25%,\" McBride said.\n\n\"It won't necessarily be a one-for-one correlation,\" he said. Not everything is so closely tied to the prime rate, especially considering things like auto loans. \"Car loan rates may decline, but not necessarily by a quarter of a percentage point,\" he added.\n\nThose shopping for homes shouldn't be too worried about this. \"Mortgage rates move well in advance of the Fed, so mortgage rates are not tied to the short term interest rate that the Fed affects,\" McBride said.\n\nIt's a good time to save, pay off debt, or refinance\n\nThere's not much that you can or should do, except the usual: Save for when you need it and spend what you have to.\n\nJust because you may not be seeing quite as high of returns on your savings account or CDs doesn't mean to stop putting money in. \"You need savings for unplanned expenses no matter what,\" McBride said. \"In fact, if interest rates are falling, I'd argue that's even more of an incentive to boost your savings. Because if the economy rolls over, you want to make sure that you've got plenty of money saved.\"\n\nHe adds that periods of lower interest rates might be an excellent time to look into paying down high-interest debt or refinancing student loans. \"There's an opportunity to shop around and make sure you're getting the best deal,\" McBride said.\n\nBut for those looking to buy a car, get a loan, or take out a home equity line of credit, lower rates make for an excellent time to do it.\n\nMore personal finance coverage", "description": "When the Fed cuts interest rates, it's to encourage spending and growth, and it affects everything from savings accounts to mortgages to loans.", "authors": ["Liz Knueven"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d41d0b3454a3907015a8288-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
