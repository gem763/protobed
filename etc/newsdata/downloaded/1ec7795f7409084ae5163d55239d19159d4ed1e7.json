Russia was banned in 2017 from competing in the 2018 Winter Olympics due to the use of performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nTom Burt, the corporate vice president of customer security and trust at Microsoft, wrote in a blog post on Monday that \u201cthe methods used in the most recent attacks are similar to those routinely used by Strontium to target governments, militaries, think tanks, law firms, human rights organizations, financial firms and universities around the world.\u201d\n\nBurt noted that the majority of the recent attacks were not successful and that Microsoft has notified all the impacted companies. Microsoft did not name the organizations that were targeted.\n\nBurt wrote that the company was raising awareness of these cyber risks to organizations in advance of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nThe group was previously identified as a Russian-backed organization by multiple security firms and by the United Kingdom\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, with individuals associated with the hacking group indicted by a U.S. grand jury in 2018 for similar targeting of sports and anti-doping groups.\n\nMicrosoft took steps against Strontium in August, when the company took down six internet domains created by the group as part of efforts to step up election security. In total, Microsoft has taken down 84 domains associated with Strontium over the past two years.\n\nBurt wrote that the company hopes to \u201craise awareness\u201d of these types of attacks and provide steps for companies and individuals on how to protect themselves.\n\n\u201cWe believe it\u2019s important to share significant threat activity like that we\u2019re announcing today,\u201d Burt wrote. \u201cWe think it\u2019s critical that governments and the private sector are increasingly transparent about nation-state activity so we can all continue the global dialogue about protecting the internet.\u201d", "description": "Microsoft announced Monday that it had found evidence of a Russian hacking group targeting\u00a0more than a dozen national and international sporting and anti-doping groups with \u201csignificant cyberattacks.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/microsoft_062018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
