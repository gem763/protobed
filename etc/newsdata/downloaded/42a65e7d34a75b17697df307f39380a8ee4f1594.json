But Oksana says the boy is the 'spitting image' of his father and there is no doubt\n\nShe 'left of her own accord to return to Russia', he said, contradicting her account that the ex-monarch had walked out on her.\n\nThe lawyer claimed that the Sultan was ready to settle 'a significant and generous sum of money' on Oksana if she agreed to protect his 'privacy'.\n\nThe amount was not specified but was said to include her medical fees during her pregnancy and living expenses.\n\nHis ex-wife 'declined to accept the proposal' claiming 'a UK tabloid was prepared to pay her handsomely for her story'.\n\nClaims in a Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda that he did not 'give her a dime' towards the costs of the child were false, and 'arrangements were made' to pay her $20,000 (\u00a316,360), he said.\n\n'In addition Ms Oksana was gifted a Porsche Cayenne and jewellery including a Jacob Arabo ring and items by \u2026 Cartier,' he claimed.\n\nThis Porsche model costs up to \u00a3117,500 in Russia and the ring has been valued at \u00a3203,000.\n\nOksana has said she was forced to sell the ring for three times less than its value to cover her medical costs in Switzerland.\n\nThe ex-king's also denied claims from Oksana's camp portraying the Kelantan ruler as superrich with a \u00a350 million a year spending budget.\n\nIn particular, the allegation he spent 'several million dollars' on yachts and nightclub parties in Ibiza marking her 25th birthday were 'untrue and false'.\n\nNor did he have property around the world or a fleet of 90 luxury cars, said the lawyer.", "description": "Oksana Voevodina is going through a bitter divorce from her ex-husband\u00a0Sultan Muhammad V of Kelantan and now their paternity row over Oksana's son is set to go to court.", "authors": ["Will Stewart In Moscow For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/18/19551686-0-image-a-59_1570730261046.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
