There was also a \"lack of awareness by the stewards of their surroundings,\" according to a 'Report to Prevent Future Deaths' written by the coroner, Alison Mutch.\n\nThe report, sent to United and the local authority, recommended changes at the stadium due to \"a risk future deaths will occur unless action is taken\".\n\nThe report revealed that United accepted the stewards \"were not complying with the code of conduct\" but it also stated, \"there was no evidence of regular audits of stewards and their compliance with the code of conduct\".\n\nUnited say they have acted upon the areas of concern regarding safety made in the report.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
