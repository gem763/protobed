Robert Verbruggen of National Review joins me to talk about the bizarre fact that the ATF and DOJ are attempting to enforce a firearms regulation that does not exist.\n\nA guy named Joseph Roh illegally manufactured and sold AR-15s and other guns through a slapstick scheme to avoid the law. A judge issued a tentative order against Roh \u2014 but in the process held that lower receivers are not firearms under current regulations, thus acquitting Roh of some of the charges. The government decided to let Roh off with a slap on the wrist rather than pursue the matter further, to prevent the order, as CNN puts it, from \u201cbecoming permanent, drawing publicity, and creating case law that could hamper ATF enforcement efforts.\u201d It ended up on CNN\u2019s website regardless, and anyone prosecuted for selling AR-15 lowers going forward will be tempted to try Roh\u2019s defense.\n\nAs Verbruggen told me, there\u2019s no easy fix for the government here. \u201cFixing\u201d the regulation could throw previous convictions and current cases into doubt, but leaving the regulation as is will be problematic for future cases, to say the least.\n\nI\u2019m also really pleased that Second Amendment activist and Wisconsin resident Aaargo Jay could join the show today to give his take on Governor Tony Evers calling for a special legislative session in an attempt to pass a \u201cred flag\u201d law and universal background checks. I\u2019m even more excited that Aaargo Jay is going to be at the 2nd Amendment Rally coming up in Washington, D.C. on November the 2nd. I\u2019ll also be in attendance, and hope to see you there as well.\n\nWe also have the story of a North Dakota man who received probation for a shooting in the state, a self-defense shooting in an Ohio home invasion, and a conservation officer in Michigan who\u2019s making a habit out of being in the right place at the right time to save a life.\n\nYou can get the show as a podcast through Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, and Townhall.com\u2019s podcast page, as well as subscribing to Townhall Media at YouTube. Thanks for watching, listening, and spreading the word!", "description": "The ATF's definition of a firearm conflicts with the design of AR-15's, and the agency has been enforcing a rule that doesn't actually apply to the rifles.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://bearingarms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cam-and-Co-Thumbnail-102219.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
