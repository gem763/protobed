Kamala Harris ripped the way Donald Trump described the operation to take out ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, comparing the president's tone to video game commentary.\n\nThe presidential candidate got asked about the news in an appearance on the Seth Meyers show, after Trump's Sunday press conference where he shared dramatic details of the raid \u2013 including details that al-Baghdadi died 'whimpering' that top Pentagon officials would not verify.\n\n'Donald Trump \u2013 that press conference was extraordinary,' she told Meyers in front of a studio audience. 'You would've think that he was talking about watching and giving commentary on a video game,' Harris told him on the 'Late Night' show that aired Monday night.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris during an interview with host Seth Meyers on October 28, 2019. She criticized the way President Donald Trump described the raid that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\n\n'He is the commander in chief. The commander in chief of the United States of America has as her highest priority the responsibility to concern herself,' she said, to applause from the audience, with our nations security and he security of our homeland,' she intoned.\n\n'At every step [it] becomes clear that he clearly does not fully appreciate the importance of the job, which must be done with integrity, must be done in a way that is solemn, understanding what is at stake,' she said.\n\nHarris praised special forces, who she said don't get the credit they deserve. She brought up President Trump's attacks on the CIA over the Russia probe, saying the nation has had a president 'who has spent full time attacking the integrity and the professionalism and the sacrifice of those professionals,' she said. She congratulated those forces \u2013 but not Trump \u2013 on the raid.\n\n'They did a lot of shooting, they did a lot of blasting, even not going through the front door,' President Donald Trump said, describing the raid Sunday\n\nDOWN TO THE WIRE: President Donald J. Trump is pictured in the Situation Room of the White House on October 26, 2019, monitoring developments as U.S. Special Operations forces conduct a capture or kill mission in Syria against ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Vice President Mike Pence, along with National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, left; Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark A. Milley, right, were all present at the time\n\nPresident Trup announced that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died in a raid carried out by U.S. forces\n\nA picture taken on October 28, 2019 shows Syrians sifting through the rubble at the site of a suspected US-led operation against Islamic State (IS) chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the previous day, on the edge of the small Syrian village of Barisha in the country's opposition-held northwestern Idlib province\n\nTrump laced his remarks with cinematic details, many of which, according to NBC, concerned officials whose job is to maintain secrecy and tactical advantage. Trump described the role of a 'talented' dog used by U.S. forces, the eight helicopters who swooped in, the dramatic decision to use explosives to enter the compound where the terror fugitive was hiding, and Baghdadi's decision to blow himself up at the end of tunnel.\n\n'At every step [it] becomes clear that he clearly does not fully appreciate the importance of the job, which must be done with integrity, must be done in a way that is solemn, understanding what is at stake,' Harris said\n\nAnother late night host, Jimmy Kimmel, poked fun at Trump's demeanor during his Sunday statement from the White House, with former President Barack Obama's address to the nation upon the death of Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe edited clip features Obama speaking in a deadly serious tone, contrasting with Trump saying: 'They did a lot of shooting, they did a lot of blasting, even not going through the front door. You know you would think \u2013 you go through the door. If you're a normal person, you say \"knock knock. May I come in?\"'\n\nMeyers also asked Harris about her views of impeachment as a former California prosecutor. 'We have a clear display of consciousness of guilt, when they were attempting to then put the transcript into some secret computer. We have a cover-up, that is that,' she said. 'And we have a confession. And as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it. ... The American public, we know what we see. And frankly somebody ought to tell Donald Trump he has a right to remain silent,' she said.", "description": "Democratic Sen.
