While scratches or physical wear can be prevented with cases and mindful handling, it can be much harder to stop system slow down, which can creep its way into the user experience until one day your phone doesn\u2019t feel quite so fast anymore.\n\nWhen that happens, you\u2019ll spend too much time trying to figure out what to blame for this system bog and how to fix it, a frustrating process when nothing feels like it\u2019s working.\n\nAfter culling your background apps and enabling/disabling features in an effort to get your phone\u2019s performance back up to speed, it may seem your only option left is to reset your phone to factory defaults \u2014 but not so fast. There\u2019s another step you should take before such drastic measures, and that\u2019s to clear your smartphone\u2019s app caches.\n\nClearing out the app caches \u2014 where apps store temporary files and other data \u2014 can be just as effective as a full-on factory reset for restoring your device\u2019s performance and responsiveness. Better still, the process keeps your personal data, settings configuration, and installed apps intact (though some app data such as login information or locally-stored saved game files may be lost).\n\nIt\u2019s possible that some of these cached files can eventually become corrupt, causing all manner of performance hang-ups like apps loading slowly or crashing, a laggy UI, or full-blown lockups that require hard resets. If your device is displaying similar symptoms, then clearing the app caches to remove the offending files will likely help return its performance to normal.\n\nHow to delete app caches on all Android smartphones\n\nAs mentioned before, wiping app cache won\u2019t remove your personal files or system settings nor uninstall any apps, but it\u2019s possible you may lose saved login credentials, saved games, and other temporary app data. If you want to keep these files, be sure to save them or perform a system backup first.\n\nAlso, if after you\u2019ve performed the cache clean up and your device is still running slow, then it\u2019s probably time to perform a full factory reset.\n\nAndroid 9 Pie (9.0 and higher)\n\nWhile this task used to require users to boot into recovery mode to access and delete caches, as of Android 7.1 and higher, Google has removed the option to batch-delete app caches from recovery mode even though the potential for problems caused by junk files hanging out in your cache remains the same.\n\nBatch-delete caches with Files by Google\n\nIt seems strange that the only solution for batch-clearing app caches on Android Pie\u2014Files by Google\u2014is not a standard inclusion and must be downloaded separately. Still, it\u2019s by far the easiest way to clear cached files available.\n\nScreenshot: Brendan Hesse, Files by Google app\n\nDownload Files by Google from the app store. Be sure to give the app permission to access your storage and app usage during installation. Open the app. It will automatically inform you of junk files, unused/unnecessary apps, and large files taking up extra space that you can delete. Delete these extraneous files and apps to alleviate some of the bloat and hopefully solve any issues they\u2019re causing.\n\nDelete individual app caches in Android 9 Pie\u2019s settings menu\n\nWhile Android 9 might not include an option to batch-delete caches by default, if you don\u2019t want to download Files by Google you can instead delete app caches individually from the System settings\u2014fair warning, it\u2019s tedious, and the more apps you have the worse it will be.\n\nScreenshot: Brendan Hesse\n\nOpen the Settings app on your device Go to Apps & Notifications > See all Tap the name of an app, then tap \u201cData usage\u201d Tap \u201cClear Cache\u201d Repeat for all apps\n\nAndroid 8 Oreo (8.0)\n\nIf you are still running Android 8 Oreo, you can delete cached files by going to Settings > Storage > Cached data and then deleting the cache.\n\nOlder versions of Android\n\nOn the off-chance you happen to be running an even older version of Android, you can delete both system and app caches through recovery mode:\n\nTurn off your Pixel device. Press and hold the power and volume down buttons until your device boots into the recovery mode. Select your preferred language Select \u201cWipe Data and Cache\u201d then \u201cWipe Cache\u201d Select yes to confirm After the deletion process is complete, select \u201creboot\u201d from the main menu to restart your device and complete the operation.\n\nThis story has been updated since its original publication.", "description": "Android smartphones are great, but they\u2019re not immune to the ravages of time.
