That fell short, as expected, of the two thirds needed to override a presidential veto.\n\nTen Republicans, however, voted with Democrats on the measure, reflecting the unease many within the Republican party have with Mr Trump\u2019s approach.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The president is not interested in signing other domestic spending bills until there is agreement on the border wall, according to an anonymous senior administration official.\n\nFunding for many federal agencies expires 21 November and an impasse would lead to a sizeable government shutdown, bigger in scope than what happened less than one year ago.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Democrats, however, have described the White House\u2019s demand as a non-starter.\n\nMr Trump earlier this year declared a national emergency on the southern border to unilaterally move several billions of dollars from the Pentagon and instead use it to finance barriers along the US-Mexico border.\n\nHe took the step after congress refused to give him the money he wanted for his wall. That dispute led to last winter\u2019s record-long 35-day partial government shutdown.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But for the US president, showing progress on the wall is an important campaign promise to fulfil as he seeks re-election and he has said it is necessary to prevent migrants from coming across the southern border.\n\nWhite House officials have said that if lawmakers do not appropriate the funds that Mr Trump has demanded for the wall, they will circumvent congress again and move money away from the military budget.\n\nLawmakers from both parties say that until the White House and congressional leaders can reach agreement on the key issue of the wall, no real progress can be made on a broader budget deal that is needed to fund most parts of the government through the 2020 budget year, which began on 1 October.\n\n\u201cThat is the linchpin,\u201d Senate Appropriations Committee chairman Richard Shelby said of the border wall. Mr Trump is \u201cvery interested in the wall, very adamant about it\u201d.\n\nMr Shelby said spending negotiations with the House are in a \u201cprolonged slump\u201d. But the necessary high-level negotiations between the White House and congressional leaders have yet to occur. And the general chaos that has overtaken the Capitol over impeachment and Mr Trump\u2019s Syria policy has injected additional uncertainty into the budget negotiations.\n\nCombined, the factors make it likely that congress will resort to passing another short-term spending bill after the current one expires to at least keep the government from shutting down for several more weeks.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to fund the wall,\u201d said House Appropriations Committee chairwoman Nita Lowey.\n\nMs Lowey held out hope for compromise. \u201cLet me just say that the appropriations process can do extraordinary things,\u201d she said.\n\nThus far, with the fiscal year underway, the Senate has not passed one of the 12 annual spending bills that must become law to fund the portions of the government whose budget congress controls, such as the Pentagon and other federal agencies.\n\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell announced on Thursday that some bills will come up for votes next week. He called on Democrats to \u201cmake good on all the talk about bipartisanship and support them\u201d \u2013 but that still would leave the wall issue no closer to resolution.\n\nOn the ground, construction on the wall is not progressing as quickly as Mr Trump would like.\n\nLast week a federal court in El Paso, Texas, ruled against his national emergency approach.\n\nThere were 71 miles of new replacement barrier completed as of last week; Mr Trump has promised 500 miles by the end of next year, a goal that may not be realistic.\n\nWhite House officials say the president\u2019s emergency declaration allowed him to take $3.6bn from the Pentagon\u2019s budget to use on the barriers, in addition to $1.38bn congress appropriated for the project in 2019.\n\nAlong with billions of dollars from other Pentagon and Treasury accounts that did not require an emergency declaration, that added up to a total of about $8.1bn for the wall for the 2019 fiscal year.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s decision to take money from the military construction budget angered lawmakers of both parties, partly because it overrode congress\u2019 constitutional authority over spending, while resulting in the cancellation or delay of some important military construction projects across the country and internationally.\n\nThat led the House and Senate to twice pass resolutions to overturn the national emergency declaration, both of which Mr Trump vetoed; an earlier veto override vote failed in the House in March. But the White House has said that it is eyeing an additional $3.6bn from the military construction budget in 2020, if congress does not give the president the money he wants.\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "The US Senate did not\u00a0block\u00a0Donald Trump from redirecting taxpayer money to fund a border wall on Thursday, laying bare the budget crisis that looms over Washington heading into November.", "authors": ["Erica Werner"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/18/12/trump-hands.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
