Gleason\u2019s name but without him, Rolling Stone magazine might not ever have existed. When publisher Jann Wenner was a pup, he idolized Gleason, the longtime jazz critic in San Francisco who also appreciated the folk and rock scenes in a way most jazz writers did not (Gleason was also one of Lenny Bruce\u2019s great champions). Gleason took the young enthusiast under his wing and later helped raise the seed money\u2014and come up with the title\u2014for Wenner\u2019s start-up magazine about rock \u2019n\u2019 roll culture.\n\n\u201cRalph was our eminence grise,\u201d writes Wenner in the Foreword to Music in the Air, one of two sterling new collections of Gleason\u2019s work published by Yale University Press due out this May. \u201cHe gave us credibility as well as contacts.\u201d Gleason also wrote for the magazine during its nascent years, helping shape its sensibility with not just attitude but taste and authority.\n\nTake, for instance, this tribute to Duke Ellington\u2014\u201cFarewell to the Duke\u201d\u2014published shortly after Ellington\u2019s death. It will give you a glimpse into Gleason\u2019s huge talent, which deserves more recognition. We hope it whets your appetite for more, in which case you must cop Music in the Air and Conversations in Jazz. Originally published in Rolling Stone, \u201cFarewell to the Duke\u201d is reprinted here with permission of Toby Gleason. Please enjoy one master paying tribute to another.", "description": "He became so successful as a nightclub performer, as a songwriter, as a personality, that his serious musical efforts never got the attention they deserved.", "authors": ["Ralph J.
