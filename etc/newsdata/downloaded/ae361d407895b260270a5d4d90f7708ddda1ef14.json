I knew she could be sitting where [senior NXIVM figure and former \u2018Smallville\u2019 actress] Allison Mack is now, facing years in jail. At times I lost hope.\u201d\n\nALLISON MACK ALLEGEDLY WANTED NXIVM SEX CULT \u2018SLAVE MASTERS\u2019 TO BE \u2018SISTER WIVES\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2026 I was convinced the moment that Keith Raniere was arrested that that would wake her up, but that failed,\u201d continued Oxenberg. \u201cThere were many times I didn\u2019t have hope, and my life was threatened. But then the government called my lawyers and said \u2018we want Catherine to know we\u2019re moving in with the FBI aggressively.\u2019 That was the moment when I had hope.\u201d\n\nBack in 2011, Oxenberg and India, who is 28 today, attended an NXIVM class after a friend of the actress told her about a life-changing course conducted by the group. Oxenberg wasn\u2019t that interested after the initial introduction, but India was, and she wanted to continue the program with her mom.\n\nIndia became increasingly drawn to the group and even donated the majority of her inheritance to NXIVM.\n\nALLISON MACK PLEADS GUILTY TO RACKETEERING CHARGES IN NXIVM CASE\n\nIt took several years for India to finally leave NXIVM in 2017 \u2014 and it took Oxenberg publicly speaking out against the group, jeopardizing the relationship with her daughter.\n\n\u201cIndia is very committed to her healing process,\u201d said Oxenberg about her daughter today. \u201cShe understands what happened to her and she is empowered. I\u2019m doing everything that I can to spend time with my other girls; Maya just started college and [Celeste] is in 11th grade. I tapped into a quality of maternal strength that I didn\u2019t know I had. That I would be willing to risk my life for my child. I know myself better, and I have become a more courageous person as a result of my ordeal. My children taught me what it means to really love somebody. I\u2019m proud to be a mom.\u201d\n\nRaniere, 58, was found guilty in June of this year of sex-trafficking and coercing women into sex. Prosecutors told jurors that Raniere \u2013 known to his followers as \u201cVanguard\u201d and revered as \u201cthe smartest man in the world\u201d \u2013 was actually a creepy con man who barely got passing grades in college. According to testimony, Raniere\u2019s \u201cslaves\u201d were forced to give up nude photos and other material as \u201ccollateral\u201d to keep them in line.\n\nFORMER NXIVM FOLLOWER RECALLS DATING LEADER KEITH RANIERE, MEETING 'SMALLVILLE' STAR ALLISON MACK\n\nAmong the more damning allegations against Raniere were that he had some women branded with his initials and that he started having sex with a follower when she was 15. Prosecutors said he took nude photos of the teen that were shown, one by one, to the eight women and four men on the jury.\n\nThese days, Oxenberg is moving forward with her life and has even found romance along the way.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not in the entertainment business, which is thrilling for me,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cBut how I met him is because my house burned down [in Malibu last November]. He wasn\u2019t a firefighter, but he was definitely a first responder. He reached out through family friends, texted me 48 hours after the fire and said, \u2018I have a home in Brentwood that\u2019s empty, and you\u2019re welcome to stay with your family.\u2019 And we fell in love. I met him [less than a year] ago, and he\u2019s, I would say, the love of my life.\u201d\n\n'DYNASTY' STAR CATHERINE OXENBERG DETAILS HOW SHE SAVED DAUGHTER INDIA FROM ALLEGED SEX CULT NXIVM\n\nBack in August 2018, Oxenberg claimed to Fox News that some of the women associated with NXIVM were put on strict diets that were 500 to 800 calories a day.\n\n\u201cKeith had a specific body type that he was attracted to and he wanted women to be very thin, so they were on starvation diets,\u201d she said, adding that a lot of the women in this subgroup were also \"given an assignment to have sex with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to, but they felt obligated to because they felt like if they didn\u2019t, if they said no to their master, then they were going to release this collateral. So at so many levels, this was just so wrong.\u201d\n\nOxenberg, who found out all of these details out within a two-week period, said that the moment that she \u201ccompletely lost\u201d her mind was when she found out \u201cthey were branding the women with [Raniere\u2019s] initials on their pubic area.\u201d\n\nROB LOWE REACTS TO DEMI MOORE\u2019S MEMOIR, SAYS STAR WAS \u2018VERY HELPFUL\u2019 TO HIS SOBRIETY\n\nAfter learning about the subgroup and what they were doing, Oxenberg took action.\n\n\u201cFirst to educate myself about cults than to figure out how I was going to do an intervention, and then it\u2019s kind of snowballed from there,\" she said. \"It\u2019s the most horrific group, touting itself as female empowerment that\u2019s how subversive it is.\u201d\n\nOxenberg said her daughter was not a sex slave.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not her experience,\u201d the actress said. \u201cAnd what she shared with me doesn\u2019t seem like that that was her experience at all.\u201d\n\nTo get her daughter out, Oxenberg took her battle public and let the world know she was trying to save India from NXIVM.\n\n\"There\u2019s a chance she could never come out of this, and she\u2019s too good to have that life. She deserves something better. So the risk that I took is permanent estrangement, and for over a year she wouldn\u2019t talk to me. She was very, very angry that I had made this decision to expose her.\u201d\n\nBut for Oxenberg, it was all worth it. Now, India is back at home.\n\n\u201cShe is such a brilliant, beautiful, young woman and she\u2019s going to be more than OK,\u201d Oxenberg said. \u201cAnd ultimately she will come out the wiser for it, and she will have a gift to offer for the world because of what she\u2019s been through and because of the depth of her experience.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cI have to also respect that this was her journey,\" Oxenberg added. \"And eventually, I will understand why she chose to go through this, and what gift she has to offer the world as a result of this.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Mariah Haas and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Former \u201cDynasty\u201d actress Catherine Oxenberg is grateful she was able to save her daughter India from the alleged sex cult NXIVM.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/08/17/694940094001_5823385288001_5823384373001-vs.jpg"}
