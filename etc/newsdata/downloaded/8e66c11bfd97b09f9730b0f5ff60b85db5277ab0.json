The working title could be \u201cMiracle in Schijnpoortweg\u201d. Because that\u2019s the unprepossessing suburb of Antwerp where Andy Murray sealed his 46th \u2013 and arguably most remarkable \u2013 ATP title.\n\nWithin a few seconds of his 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory over old rival Stan Wawrinka, Murray was burying his face in a towel to hide the tears. A couple of minutes later, he was holding the European Open trophy \u2013 a stylised sculpture of a serving tennis player which, for some reason, has no head.\n\nThe amazing thing is that, until very recently, Murray had no functioning right hip. Which is how the Australian Open came to commission that infamous \u201cFarewell Andy\u201d video in January.\n\nAs the British doubles specialist Joe Salisbury put it on Sunday, \u201cEveryone thought he was gonna be retired at the start of the year.\u201d\n\nIt is less than seven months since Murray returned to a tennis court with his new metal hip, gingerly patting a ball against a practice wall in his home village of Oxshott. Around four months since he abruptly announced that he would be playing doubles at Queen\u2019s. And less than two months since he went to Mallorca for a second-tier singles tournament where he was comfortably beaten by Matteo Viola, the world No 240.", "description": "Perhaps they will make a movie of it one day.", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/20/TELEMMGLPICT000213614701-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
