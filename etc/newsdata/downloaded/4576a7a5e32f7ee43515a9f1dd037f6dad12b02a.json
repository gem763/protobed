Single-family homes in San Francisco are way too expensive to consider.\n\nHere's how we've been thinking about it:\n\nMore Matters: Taking these steps can help you avoid a legal battle with your relatives over the inheritance of a house\n\nTownhouses are more expensive but have more room. We\u2019d have to buy one in a less desirable neighborhood. So I was thinking a condo will be better, since renters might not be willing to pay extra for the townhouse. If we were buying for long term, I would go for a townhouse since it is more spacious and, I think, a better investment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis decision is so hard and stressful for us, we could really use your advice.\n\nA: In San Francisco, where you live, home prices have been on an upward trajectory for some time. Every time a Silicon Valley-based company like Uber or Dropbox goes public, thousands of people become overnight millionaires. One of the first things they want to do is buy a home, which sends prices escalating further.\n\nIf you own a home, you're happy. If you don't, you're unhappy because rents are skyrocketing, too, and you're worried you'll never be able to find an affordable place to live.\n\nIf you lived somewhere else, we\u2019d wonder whether buying a home now (condo or townhouse) is the right move at all. Buying a home that you plan to live in for only two to three years, and that you then intend to rent out, can be a great real estate investment strategy. But you need to know what kind of rental income you\u2019ll generate and if it\u2019s enough to pay the expenses associated with the property (yes, even in San Francisco, that\u2019s important) and then some (because you should make a little money on your investment). You also need to know if you\u2019re cut out to be a landlord, and a long-distance landlord at that. Who will make sure the property stays rented, is maintained and that the bills get paid?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo let\u2019s start with buying a home you\u2019re going to live in for two to three years. That\u2019s not long. While prices in the Bay Area have increased dramatically, that isn\u2019t guaranteed. What happens if you want to sell in three years, and prices have declined substantially?\n\nMany experts are predicting a recession next year. When recessions hit, they can affect home prices, even in hot markets. And when home prices go down substantially, they can stay down for a while. As hard as it is to day-trade the stock market, it\u2019s equally difficult to know when you\u2019re looking at the top or bottom of a real estate market.\n\nLet\u2019s say you buy and agree that instead of selling in a few years if prices have declined, you\u2019ll rent out the property. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on your plate: collect monthly rents, fix things that need repairs, deal with problem tenants and neighbor issues, make real estate tax and mortgage payments, and a whole host of other issues.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSay you have all that figured out, and then you want to make sure you find the right property to put your investment cash. A townhouse that costs you $6,000 per month should rent for more than that each month. Hopefully, the price of the property will rise over time, and you may get a deduction for any losses. Talk with your tax preparer to make sure that works for your personal finances.\n\nMore Matters: Here\u2019s one reason it may not be a good idea to co-own a home with your elderly parents\n\nWe can\u2019t help you choose whether a townhouse or condo is the better investment. It really depends on what you can afford, what the local housing stock looks like and how much people are prepared to pay.\n\nSometimes single-family homes appreciate more quickly, but condos often have fewer repair issues associated with them, and the condominium association in larger buildings takes care of repairs to the exterior and common areas of the building. And you'll pay for that, in the form of a monthly association fee, which will reduce the total amount you can borrow.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen you own a townhouse or rowhouse, that home may not be part of an association (so you save on the monthly fee) that takes care of the exterior of the building, but that means if the building needs repairs, painting, garage door maintenance, window replacements or roof repairs, you\u2019re the one who will have to make the repairs and foot the bill.\n\nYour next step is to do some serious homework. Start looking at neighborhoods, the types of properties there, what you\u2019d be happy living in (because that should inform any purchase \u2014 what if you don\u2019t move?) and how much you can afford to pay. Then, think about how much someone would pay to rent that property, how easy it would be to care for it and whether owning this rental property means you won\u2019t get approved for a mortgage in your new town (in case you decide to buy a home there).\n\nIlyce Glink is the author of \u201c100 Questions Every First-Time Home Buyer Should Ask\u201d (4th Edition).
