The most anticipated make-up line of the year has landed, yes, we\u2019re talking about Victoria Beckham Beauty. After giving us a sneak peek earlier in the week, Beckham\u2019s debut make-up collection has finally dropped. And you won\u2019t be disappointed.\n\nKicking off the clean beauty brand is Victoria\u2019s Smoky Eye Wardrobe. Having firmly established her signature brown smoky eye over the past decade, it\u2019s unsurprising that the make-up mogul\u2019s first move was to drop a capsule collection of serious eye make-up. In fact, Beckham\u2019s seemingly been working on the first products from her eponymous brand for years now, saying, \u2018Eyes are very signature for me. The products may be new, but they\u2019ve been a lifetime in the making.\u2019\n\nWhat\u2019s in Victoria\u2019s personal smoky eye wardrobe we hear you ask? Three failsafe eye products that Beckham herself keeps in her make-up bag.\n\nPhoto credit: Victoria Beckham More\n\nFirst up is a satisfyingly sleek (and totally plastic-free) Smoky Eye Brick (\u00a348) eyeshadow compact in four iterations that nod to the designer\u2019s fashion prowess: Signature (VB\u2019s favourite shades for a day time contoured eye look), Tuxedo (your vegan-friendly kit for the ultimate smoky eye), Tweed (warm autumnal shades of terracotta and deep plum) and Royal (vegan hues of navy blue).\n\nFour pearlescent cream Lid Lustre (\u00a328) eyeshadows inspired by the healing and protective power of crystals that Victoria always surrounds herself with, and three shades of Satin Kajal Liner (\u00a320), including what might just be the best kohl pencil we\u2019ve ever come across, complete the collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best bit? Victoria Beckham Beauty is on a mission to set higher standards in beauty by using minimal plastic, 100% post-consumer waste secondary packaging and shipping materials that are recyclable or biodegradable. Even the pouch your order is delivered in is reusable. So now you can nab the entire collection and do the planet a favour as well.\n\nUpdate 11/9/19:\n\nHaving teased us with behind-the-scenes footage of her upcoming beauty line back in July, Victoria Beckham has finally confirmed the launch date of the most anticipated make-up drop of the year.\n\nThe designer took to her new Victoria Beckham Beauty Instagram account to reveal the launch date, posting a boomerang of what we can only assume is the make-up mogul's own eye alongside the caption:\n\n'The final countdown starts NOW - #VictoriaBeckhamBeauty launches in just four days. Stay tuned for more news about the debut collection. Beauty that moves you. Link in bio. #CleanBeauty\n\nFrom the smokey bronzed eyeshadow, fluttery lashes and straight pencilled eyebrows, we're guessing the new line will include everything you need to recreate the Brit's signature beauty look.\n\nBeckham also posted an image of the make-up line's logo that links through to her new website where a countdown to launch awaits eager fans. Currently on just over three days, we can surmise that the Victoria Beckham Beauty line is going to drop on Saturday 14th September, slap bang in the middle of London Fashion Week.\n\nWatch this space for more details as they drop.\n\n\n\nUpdate 9/7/2019:\n\nVictoria Beckham has revealed a sneak peek from behind the scenes on set where the designer was shooting content for her upcoming beauty line, Victoria Beckham Beauty.\n\nStory continues", "description": "It\u2019s finally here!", "authors": ["Elle Beauty Team"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1WaWjvvScbbIpS0W5aQ8Eg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_865/c21dc392c494bb017fef4a741066110d", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
