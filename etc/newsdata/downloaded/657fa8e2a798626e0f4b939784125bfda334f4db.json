Handle with care.", "language": "en", "text": "Technology columnist\n\nYou can fold up Samsung's $2,000 phone, no problem. But for heaven\u2019s sake, keep your fingernails away. Keys, coins and water, too.\n\nWe got a sneak peek of the Galaxy Fold in April, when it was originally supposed to go on sale and kick-start a new generation of \u201cfoldable\u201d screen devices. Then Samsung delayed the launch after its futuristic flexible screen began peeling apart and malfunctioning on early units.\n\nOn Monday, I got a new Fold to review, and it hasn\u2019t broken. Yet. The new version, scheduled to be in U.S. stores on Friday, has hardened screen edges, a new hinge and a giant warning about all the ways you might accidentally break it. A phone that can open up into a tablet is truly a precious thing \u2014 maybe still a little too precious.\n\n[Help Desk: Ask our tech columnist a question]\n\nUsing the new Galaxy Fold has undoubtedly raised my blood pressure. A \u201ccare instruction\u201d guide attached to the front of the phone includes the following list of ordinary-sounding activities that might destroy this extraordinary device:\n\nDo not press or apply \u201cexcessive pressure\u201d to the flexible screen with anything sharp, including fingernails. (Good thing you don\u2019t operate a phone with fingers.)\n\nKeep keys, coins and cards away from the folded-up Fold, which has a slight gap between the two halves of its screen. (Good thing you never keep such items in pockets.)\n\nDo not expose the Fold to liquids or \u201csmall particles\u201d that could enter through its exposed hinge. (Is pocket lint particles? Unclear.)\n\nKeep it away from credit cards, which it might demagnetize.\n\nWith apologies to Kenny Rogers: Samsung knows how to fold \u2018em. But you\u2019re gonna have to know how to hold \u2018em.\n\n\n\nWhen you unbox Samsung's Galaxy Fold, a sticker on the front of the phone lists many ways you might inadvertently damage it. (James Pace-Cornsilk/The Washington Post)\n\nI suppose we can\u2019t blame Samsung for including warnings to Fold owners after taking a black eye for version 1.0. The company says think of the Fold like an expensive, fancy watch. To add to its luxury marketing push, a new \u201cpremier service\u201d that comes with each Fold includes 24-7 call center \u201cconcierge.\u201d Samsung is also offering to replace the screen within the first year of use for $150.\n\nBut it\u2019s also hard to think of a phone as a delicate piece of jewelry in 2019. That\u2019s partly Samsung\u2019s fault: It was one of the first manufacturers to add water and dust resistance to smartphones, back with 2014\u2019s Galaxy\u2019s S5. Since then, we\u2019ve grown accustomed to making phones live as hard as we do.\n\n[Die, robocalls, die: A how-to guide to stop spammers and exact revenge]\n\nWhy would anyone put up with this? To be one of the first people to have a tablet that also fits in your pocket. Whatever our concerns might be about overdosing on screen time, the truth is that people keep buying larger and larger-screen phones. (Apple now maxes out at 6.5-inches with the iPhone 11 Pro Max, and Samsung goes up to 6.8-inches on its Note10+.) But our poor hands really can\u2019t take much more of this expansion. Folding screens could allow us to have it all.\n\nThe Fold has a slender 4.6-inch screen on its front (measured diagonally). Then it opens up like a taco to reveal a 7.3-inch screen, big enough to multitask with multiple Android apps at once.\n\nCreating an OLED screen that can fold and refold hundreds of thousands of times involved technical challenges that boggle the mind. But the question remains: Why is Samsung selling a device that it knows is still so delicate, instead of waiting until it\u2019s worked out how to make it strong? (This isn\u2019t just a Samsung problem; Apple recently introduced a white titanium credit card you can\u2019t keep near leather or denim.)\n\nMaybe, like many newborns, this gadget will turn out to be more resilient than we fear. Or, maybe it\u2019ll be remembered as the device Samsung got its superfans to test for it.\n\nRead more tech advice and analysis:\n\nRock this way: AirPods, Beats and Bose wireless ear buds take the headbang test\n\nThe spy in your wallet: Credit cards have a privacy problem\n\nGalaxy Note10: What Samsung\u2019s $950 big new phone adds \u2014 and takes away", "description": "We\u2019ve had the $2.000 folding phone for 24 hours and it hasn\u2019t broken \u2026 yet.", "authors": ["Geoffrey A.
