And his Twitter feed allows him to project the presidential image he wants.\n\nWhen it comes to Hurricane Dorian, Trump is tweeting all the warnings from the national hurricane centre that a president should. He is followed by tens of million of people and helping to spread the message about the hurricane\u2019s strength and evacuation procedures in each state is what\u2019s required.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s actions and words betray a slightly less presidential image. He sent Vice President Mike Pence on a trip to Poland in his place so he could monitor the progress of Storm Dorian. But with no events scheduled on what is a holiday weekend in the US the president has spent a number of hours at his golf club in Virginia, as he has done on many occasions during his time in the White House.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

He hasn\u2019t been shy about tweeting his achievements on the US economy either.\n\nIt may not be an accident that as the nation, and particularly states like Florida and North and South Carolina that could feel the effects of the storm \u2013 is looking to Trump for leadership, the president is pressing his case to be re-elected and trying to energise his supporter base.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \"Huge damage\" as record Hurricane Dorian hits Bahamas: In pictures Show all 10 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

All we know is it\u2019s possibly the biggest. I have -- I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve ever even heard of a Category 5. I knew it existed. And I\u2019ve seen some Category 4\u2019s -- you don\u2019t even see them that much,\u201d Trump said at a briefing with officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) headquarters in Washington DC.\n\n\u201cBut a Category 5 is something that \u2013 I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever even heard the term other than I know it\u2019s there,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the ultimate, and that\u2019s what we have unfortunately,\u201d he added, in reference to Hurricane Dorian.\n\nIn September 2017, nearly eight months into Trump\u2019s presidency, Hurricane Irma affected at least nine US states. Later that month Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico. Then last October, Hurricane Michael, which was originally designated as a Category 4, hit the Florida Panhandle. Trump spoke about each storm as if it was unprecedented.\n\nThat is what the president does \u2013 including with his comments on the economy and immigration \u2013 try and make it sound like he is facing something no other occupant of the White House has faced. It serves the residents affected by such storms little, but it is the type of reaction Trump\u2019s supporters love.\n\nFor them Trump is a unique president and anything that serves that narrative, especially from the man himself, is lapped up. That is not to say that Trump is nakedly trying to take advantage of a potential crisis. He is likely doing it without completely registering the impact. It is just what he does and he is banking on it keeping him in the White House next year.", "description": "For Donald Trump, image is everything.
