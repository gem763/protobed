Their chances of doing so this year look slim, having been drawn in Pool A alongside Ireland, Scotland, Japan and Russia, but when it comes to the Samoans who knows what to expect.\n\nSteve Jackson\u2019s men booked their place for this year\u2019s World Cup by beating Germany in the Europe/Oceania play-off in July 2018.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The former New Zealand Maori representative only took charge of Samoa in September of last year and has since overseen just two victories from six fixtures \u2013 all of which were played against tier-two nations. Jackson has spoken of bringing the \u201cfear\u201d back into the Manu jersey \u2013 something he\u2019s struggled to do so far admittedly. He\u2019ll be hoping his players step up when 24 September comes around.\n\nKey player\n\nChris Vui. The loose forward, who has 12 caps to his name, was the youngest captain in world rugby when he was handed the leadership of Samoa in 2017. His experience in the Premiership, first with Worcester and now Bristol, will give him crucial reference points when he leads his country in Japan. With a number of Samoa players plying their trade in Europe, Vui will be hopeful his men quickly adapt to the challenge posed by the likes of Ireland and Scotland in particular.\n\nPast record\n\nSamoa\u2019s best finish at the World Cup came in 1991 and 1995 when they reached the quarter-finals on both accounts before losing to Scotland and South Africa respectively.\n\nFixtures\n\nTuesday 24 September \u2013 Russia vs Samoa (Kumagaya), 11.15am\n\nRussia vs Samoa (Kumagaya), 11.15am Monday 30 September \u2013 Scotland vs Samoa (Kobe), 11.15am\n\nScotland vs Samoa (Kobe), 11.15am Saturday 5 October \u2013 Japan vs Samoa (Toyota), 11.30am\n\nJapan vs Samoa (Toyota), 11.30am Saturday 12 October \u2013 Ireland vs Samoa (Fukuoka), 11.45am\n\nOdds\n\nSamoa to win: 750/1", "description": "History shows that Samoa\u00a0know how to spring a surprise.
