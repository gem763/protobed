The study found Oregon has about 350 homeless people per 100,000 people, nearly double the national average of 168 per 100,000. The study also found that Oregon's homeless rate has increased by nearly 14.10 percent since 2014.\n\nOn any given night, thousands of people can be found sleeping on the streets of Portland. The latest count, released in August, shows that, in 2019, more people were sleeping outside in Multnomah County than at any time in the last decade. Of the 2,037 unsheltered people, nearly 80 percent reported having one or more disabilities.\n\nPORTLAND RESIDENTS, BUSINESS OWNERS WANT CITY OFFICIALS TO 'FIX' HOMELESS PROBLEM\n\nIn January, Portland launched a \"Navigation Team\" with outreach workers that have spent time going out to homeless encampments, focusing on specific locations in order to reduce impacts to area communities.\n\n\u201cThese are campsites that for a very long time have been generating concerns and safety issues,\u201d Denis Theiault, a spokesman for the Joint Office for Homeless Services, told FOX12 on Tuesday. \u201cNot just public safety issues but health and safety issues for the folks who are camping there as well as the folks who are near those sites.\"\n\nPart of that outreach includes offering sanitation services, such as a mobile hygiene unit that is comprised of two portable toilets, hand-washing stations, a garbage can, a sharp box, and lockers.\n\nThe mobile station deploys around various homeless encampments with the largest populations, according to officials. The current trailer on Southeast Flavel Street under Interstate 205 was moved to the underpass about two weeks ago.\n\nTracy Vargas, who has been camping out in southeast Portland for over three years, told FOX12 she appreciates that there is now a place where she is able to have access to a bathroom.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to find a business around the area that will let you come in and go,\u201d Vargas told FOX12 Tuesday. \u201cA lot of times you get left to going out in the woods or wherever you can go.\u201d\n\nVargas said she's also working with the homeless outreach team to get her birth certificate, and agrees the program is a \"wonderful idea.\n\nLAS VEGAS AMONG CITIES WITH HIGHEST HOMELESS RATES AS SHELTERS FACE CAPACITY ISSUES\n\nPat Perkins said she's seen an influx in homeless people in the 14 years she's lived in the area, and the garbage and human waste have grown exponentially in the past five years.\n\n\u201cIt seems like it could be a health hazard, especially when you see needles and feces on the ground,\u201d Perkins told FOX12, saying having a designated place to throw trash, hazardous materials and use the bathroom will hopefully improve conditions.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe sanitation services may be the most visible part of the outreach group but it's not their only goal, according to Theiault. He told FOX12 the group's ultimate plan is to get people permanently off the streets by providing them with necessary things to move forward.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get them their ID, we\u2019re going to get them a birth certificate, we\u2019re going to get them medical connections,\u201d he told FOX12.\n\nCity officials said Tuesday that at least 15 people from the camp under Interstate 205 have been placed in shelters, including two families.\n\nFox News' Barnini Chakraborty contributed to this report.", "description": "As the homeless crisis continues to simmer in Oregon's largest city, local officials working with nonprofit groups have deployed mobile hygiene stations in a bid to clean\u00a0up some of the largest encampments.", "authors": ["Travis Fedschun", "Travis Fedschun Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
