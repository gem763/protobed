Last week, he announced the government would begin handing out USD 3.6 million worth of Petro tokens to state authorities in bi-monthly handouts.\n\nThe Petro is the Venezuelan state\u2019s own, oil-backed cryptocurrency. Although the United States has banned it, and threatened companies or countries dealing in the token with economic sanctions, Maduro claims that a number of international parties have already traded with Venezuelan companies in the Petro. However, he refused to name the companies in question in case Washington attempted to take retaliatory action on the firms.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s Petro chief recently spoke about the token at a blockchain event in Moscow, and Caracas remains keen on convincing Russia to trade in Petros or other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBut a number of international cryptocurrency companies appear reluctant to do business in Venezuela.\n\nCryptocurrency users in the country reported this week that British exchange CEX.IO has blocked Venezuelan customers from accessing its platform. Should a Venezuela-based user attempt to access the exchange's site, a message reading \u201cyour country is currently unsupported\u201d appears.", "description": "Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has authorized Petro-to-fiat trading, and says his government will provide the necessary technology to any business holders in the country who want to start accepting crypto pay.", "authors": ["Tim Alper"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5db/12fb98194a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
