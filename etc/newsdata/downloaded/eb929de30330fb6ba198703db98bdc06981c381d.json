This meant, by the terms of the Benn Act, he had to write to the EU requesting an extension.\n\nHe did send this request, along with the second letter, saying he believed a further Brexit delay was a mistake, late on Saturday.\n\nThe Inner House of the Court of Session will consider these latest developments when it reconvenes in Edinburgh at midday.\n\nWhat is the nobile officium?\n\nThe procedure of petitioning the nobile officium is unique to Scots law but is far from being a forgotten backwater of the legal system.\n\nIts name is a Latin term meaning the \"noble office\".\n\nThe procedure offers the opportunity to provide a remedy in a legal dispute where none exists.\n\nIn other words, it can plug any gap in the law or offer mitigation if the law, when applied, would be seen to be too strict.\n\nIn this case, it could have seen an official of the court sign a letter to the EU requesting a Brexit extension, as set out in the Benn Act, should the prime minister have failed to do so.\n\nOn Saturday, in response to a question from Joanna Cherry, Commons Speaker John Bercow indicated he would be prepared to sign a letter to the EU asking for a delay if requested by the courts although he said he did not expect this to be necessary.", "description": "Scottish judges will consider whether he tried to \"frustrate\" the Benn Act by sending two letters to the EU.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13722/production/_109305697_hi057397620.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
