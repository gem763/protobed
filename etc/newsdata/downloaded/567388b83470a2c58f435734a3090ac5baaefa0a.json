'My doctor says I have recuperation of a week, but I want to do Strictly on the Saturday night.\n\n'It\u2019s not like I have to dance and do the cha cha cha or the samba. I spoke to the BBC and they have been very, very supportive. They said you have to do what you feel most comfortable for your health.'\n\nFamily tree: Shirley learned that there was a history of cancer in her family when she shot an episode of Who Do You Think You Are? last year\n\nNo waiting: Shirley has also vowed to return to the Strictly Come Dancing judging panel for Saturday's live show, leaving her just three days to recover\n\nAfter learning that having implants can block signs of breast cancer from being detected, Shirley also revealed she was considering having the scar tissue around her implants removed as well, to be extra careful.\n\nWhen she first explained her potential plans to The Sunday Times, she said: 'I've had a breast augmentation. It makes me step back and think when you go for these mammograms: \"Can you see at the back? Is it clear what you can see?\"\n\nWHAT IS BIA-ALCL? BIA-ALCL is breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma. It is a rare but treatable cancer that develops in the immune system around breast implants. By September 2018 the US Food and Drug Administration had received reports of 660 BIA-ALCL cases and nine deaths. Per its latest statistics, the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has recorded 57 cases of BIA-ALCL since 2011. The cancer most commonly occurs among women who have had breast implants with a textured surface. The disease is a type of T-cell lymphoma, which means it affects lymphocytes, more commonly known as white blood cells. These can start a cancer when one mutates to become abnormal or out of control, then divides into more cancerous cells which spread. BIA-ALCL is a relatively treatable cancer and many patients are declared cancer-free after having the implants and surrounding tissue removed. The survival rate for patients with BIA-ALCL is 89 per cent for five years after being declared cancer-free. It is considered to be a rare illness but estimates of its incidence vary \u2013 the MHRA believes it to be one case of cancer per every 24,000 implants.\n\n'It's making me sit back and think: \"Shall I remove them? Would it be a good safety precaution for me?\"'\n\nShirley's niece Mary - who is a nurse and the daughter of Shirley's late brother David, who took his life in 2003 aged 44 - has also weighed in on the matter, telling her aunt that anything put into one's body that is not 'built from your own body' is a potential risk to health.\n\nShirley learnt on Who Do You Think You Are? - the BBC series that delves into the family trees of celebrities, featuring the likes of Mary Berry, Mark Wright, Patsy Kensit and Danny Dyer - that her great-grandfather died from cancer.\n\nShe also recently nursed her mother, 82, back to health following a colon cancer diagnosis, for which she underwent treatment.\n\nShirley took to Instagram last summer to open up about the time she had a breast cancer scare herself.\n\nAlongside a picture of a breast cancer awareness poster, she typed: 'I had a routine check at the doctors and she was not happy with what she felt and saw in my breast and immediately sent me to Clatterbridge Hospital for a mammogram and ultrasound.\n\n'We go about our daily lives always busy and sometimes ignoring our body.\n\n'If something changes externally or you have any discomfort at all it\u2019s your body telling you \"take care of me\".\n\n'DON\u2019T PUT IT OFF. Early detection is key to getting better.\n\n'I have cancer in my family line so I will be being vigilant.\n\n'To all the beautiful women out there young and old get checked regularly. We have one beautiful body we need to keep it well taken care of. Thank you again to the NHS for being so marvelous.'", "description": "The Strictly Come Dancing judge revealed in September that she would be having the operation to reduce her risks of developing the disease after discovering a history of cancer in her family.", "authors": ["Rebecca Lawrence For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/14/20328462-0-image-a-59_1572358658456.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
