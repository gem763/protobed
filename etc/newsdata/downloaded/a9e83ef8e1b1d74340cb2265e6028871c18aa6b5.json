Twin boys, then I'm out of the game.'\n\nMore babies? Lamar Odom says he's keen to have two more children with his girlfriend Sabrina Parr, and would ideally like them to be twin boys\n\nAnd when asked if Sabrina was on board with his parenting plan, Lamar added: 'I think so.'\n\nThe sportsman - who was previously married to Khloe Kardashian - was eliminated from Dancing with the Stars this week, and said that also happened to be the week in which his family had come to support him in the audience of the ABC show.\n\nHe told Us Weekly magazine: 'It just so happened that the first time they see me dance, I get eliminated, but it's all good. It was a humbling experience for me and my family members, I would say. But being humbled is important in life. It keeps you grounded.'\n\nDancing time: Lamar heads into DWTS practice with Sabrina on a sunny morning in Los Angeles\n\nLamar made his romance with Sabrina, 32, official on Instagram in August, when he named her his 'new leading lady'.\n\nHe wrote: 'It's just like when you've got some coffee that's too black, which means it's too strong, what do you do? You integrate it with cream\u2026 But if you pour too much cream in it, you won't even know you ever had coffee. It used to be hot, it becomes cool. It used to be strong, it becomes weak. It used to wake you up, now it puts you to sleep.' \u2013 MALCOLM X @getuptoparr #blackroyalty.\n\n'My post goes out to the new leading woman in my life, that I'm gonna tell every day how beautiful she is, from the inside out. Thanks @getuptoparr for teaching me what real self-value means. It changed my entire mindset.'\n\nBack then: Lamar and Khloe Kardashian are spotted at LAX back in July 2012\n\nLamar and his famous ex Khloe got married back in 2009 just a month after they met. And then, just a year later the two got their own reality spin-off Khloe & Lamar which ran for just two seasons.\n\nIn 2013, the end of their relationship met its match when Khloe filed for divorce in December of that year after the basketball star was arrested for driving under the influence.\n\nJust months later, in an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Khloe revealed Lamar was unfaithful during their relationship.\n\n'Let me tell you something -- last year on my birthday, I lied to everyone, because I had to lie and say I was with my husband, when in fact my husband was missing with another girl, OK?' she said. 'And I lied, and I gave up my Beyonce tickets to Kendall, that's how badly I was hiding. And I didn't have a birthday, I was alone, and lied to everyone.'\n\nStep mom: Khloe poses with Lamar and his two kids Destiny and Lamar Jr. back in 2011 in Universal City", "description": "Lamar Odom wants twin sons.
