REUTERS/Mark Blinch\n\n\u201cLion\u201d and \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d actor Dev Patel takes on the title role of Dickens\u2019 much-loved eighth novel, leading a racially diverse cast in the Victorian-era movie.\n\nIt begins with Copperfield, a published writer, taking audiences back to the start of his life, with his widowed mother giving birth to him, supported by doting housekeeper Peggotty.\n\nWhile his early years are filled with love, all changes when his mother re-marries the brutal Mr Murdstone and the young Copperfield is sent to work in a London factory.\n\nFrom there, he encounters hardships as well as kindness as he seeks to find a place for himself in society, all the time noting down the expressions of people he meets on bits of paper.\n\n\u201cI re-read \u2018David Copperfield\u2019 about 10 or so years ago and it just felt so cinematic and funny and experimental. It felt very modern,\u201d Iannucci said after the film\u2019s press screening.\n\n\u201cIt also speaks of these sort of contemporary issues as well and I just want to get that life and that humour and approach it maybe as if there were no rules as to how you make a costume drama.\u201d\n\nThe story tackles issues such as poverty, Britain\u2019s class system as well as mental illness but Iannucci, who also-co-wrote the screenplay, peppers it with laugh-out loud comedy moments.\n\n\u201cI wanted it to feel that the audience feel that the people they\u2019re watching up there are in their present day, this is their modern world,\u201d he said, describing Dickens as \u201can inspiration\u201d.\n\nThe cast includes Oscar winner Tilda Swinton as Copperfield\u2019s donkey-hating aunt Betsey Trotwood, \u201cHowards End\u201d actress Rosalind Eleazar as his friend Agnes and \u201cDoctor Strange\u201d actor Benedict Wong as her father Mr Wickfield.\n\nThe creditor-evading Mr Micawber is played by \u201cDoctor Who\u201d actor Peter Capaldi, while \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actress Gwendoline Christie portrays the cold Jane Murdstone. Emmy-winning Ben Whishaw plays the obsequious villain Uriah Heep and \u201cHouse\u201d star Hugh Laurie features as Mr Dick.\n\nCELEBRATORY FILM\n\n\u201cI had no plan B. Dev was instantly the person I thought of. I just thought he\u2019s David Copperfield and I\u2019m so glad he said yes,\u201d Iannucci said.\n\nGlasgow-born Iannucci is best known for his political comedies \u201cThe Thick Of It\u201d and \u201cVeep\u201d as well as dark satirical movie \u201cThe Death of Stalin\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make something positive ... First of all I wanted to do a film for all generations ... because it is about a life lived,\u201d he said of his latest project.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much of a debate at the moment about what Britain is and what Britain is not and how it\u2019s excluding and how it\u2019s isolating itself. I wanted to celebrate what I feel Britain is, which is something much more lively and vibrant and cheery - the comedy heritage, the literary heritage, the variety, the arts.\u201d\n\nThough smaller than Cannes and Venice, the BFI London Film Festival has its own share of red carpet glamour.\n\nThis year\u2019s event, which runs until 0ct. 13, includes screenings of Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cThe Irishman\u201d, \u201cThe Aeronauts\u201d starring Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones as well as Timothee Chalamet\u2019s mediaeval coming-of-age tale \u201cThe King\u201d.", "description": "British satirist Armando Iannucci swaps political comedies for Charles Dickens in \"The Personal History of David Copperfield\", a comedy-drama adaptation of the literary classic that opens the BFI London Film Festival on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Marie-Louise Gumuchian", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436279532&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF91169"}
