Just run. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening,\u2019\u201d local attorney Melanie Melasky said. \u201cI turned around at one point to see what was happening, but everyone was running away.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear how many people were injured. The newspaper reported fans knocked to the ground and suffering cuts, scrapes and bruises. On-site medical staffers provided care.\n\nA medical tent and concession stands near the stage were overrun, with the medical tent left in tatters on the ground. Sections of fencing were knocked over. Tables were overturned. And beverage booths near the main stage were damaged.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going on,\u201d said George Krider, an employee of Bev Inc., the catering company that operated the drink booths at Lil WeezyAna Fest. \u201cIt was a stampede. The first thing you think is, \u2018Was it gunshots?\u2019 I think it was a fight.\u201d\n\nPolice officers stationed around the site said no shots were fired on the festival grounds.\n\nSome people looted during the melee, stealing from cash registers and tip jars, concession workers said. Some festival attendees took bottles of liquor and other drinks when the employees fearing for their safety abandoned the booths. After the beverage booths were initially overrun, and money and liquor taken, Krider said he and his fellow employees shut down the booth.\n\n\u201cWe salvaged what we could,\u201d he said.\n\nThe show continued despite the commotion. Following Meek Mill\u2019s 30-minute set, rapper Travis Scott performed and Lil Wayne headlined the festival.\n\nThe first Lil WeezyAna Fest in 2015 coincided with the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and was intended in part as a celebration of the city\u2019s recovery.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate, http://www.nola.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A crowd stampede injured several people attending a New Orleans festival organized by rapper Lil Wayne.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
