It cannot advertise within 1,000ft of schools or playgrounds and will be prohibited from using models under the age of 28 in its advertisements. It cannot sponsor or advertise at sporting events or concerts that allow people under the age of 21.\n\nBreaking up with my Juul: why quitting vaping is harder than quitting cigarettes Read more\n\nIf Juul violates any component of the agreement, it risks getting sued by the CEH. The settlement is \u201ca personal victory\u201d, CEH\u2019s executive officer, Michael Green, told the Guardian, adding that his children, aged 12 and 10, are part of the generation the agreement seeks to address.\n\n\u201cYoung people today think that smoking is gross, so big tobacco switched to a new product: e-cigarettes,\u201d said Green. \u201cJuul uses sophisticated and targeted marketing to convince youth that e-cigarettes are safe. We just couldn\u2019t sit back and allow big tobacco to hook a new generation of nicotine addicts.\u201d\n\nThe CEH settlement comes during a chaotic year for Juul, which had previously been valued at $15bn. In September, the company\u2019s chief executive Kevin Burns stepped down amid growing concerns about the prevalence of vaping among teens and a rising number of vaping-related lung injuries being reported.\n\nWhile Juul has been advertised as a smoking cessation device for adults, teen e-cigarette use doubled between 2017 and 2018, according to a survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) \u2013 leading the US surgeon general to call it an \u201cepidemic\u201d in 2018. As of 2019, more than one in four students in 12th grade, one in five in 10th grade, and one in 11 in eighth-grade vape nicotine, the study found.\n\nMeanwhile, the lawsuits against Juul are piling up. On Tuesday, a Florida woman filed a wrongful death suit against the company after her 18-year-old son died in his sleep following years of addiction to e-cigarettes.\n\nMore than 1,300 cases of lung injuries tied to vaping have been reported in recent months, leading the CDC to encourage adults to \u201c[refrain] from using e-cigarette, or vaping, products, particularly those containing THC\u201d.\n\nJuul has always maintained it is meant to be used by adults as a tool to quit smoking, and a spokesman told the Guardian it recently suspended all broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the US as it reviews company policies.\n\n\u201cWe agree with CEH that no youth should use Juul products and we are committed to combatting underage use,\u201d said the spokesman. \u201cThis settlement affirms voluntarily responsible marketing practices that Juul Labs has had in place \u2013 we have never marketed to youth and do not want any non-nicotine users to try our products.\u201d", "description": "New guidelines will set limits on how the embattled e-cigarette company can target young people", "authors": ["Kari Paul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/075be035b6dd8c4b9c9c4939b1432a7137193c67/0_56_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=60f180b131ed3a70885e13f65434cb87", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
