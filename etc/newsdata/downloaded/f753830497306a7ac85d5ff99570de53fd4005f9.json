We are looking for you and we will find you, however long it takes.\n\n\"At this stage we have not released your names or photographs, so please hand yourself in to the nearest police station as soon as possible.\n\n\"This is not going to go away and if we have to, we will name you so there will be no place for you to hide.\"\n\n(Image: Vagner Vidal/Hyde News & Pictures Ltd)\n\n(Image: Cliff Hide/LNP)\n\nDCS Hunter said there were still \"very important\" witnesses who had not yet come forward with vital information about the incident - and some who were \"refusing to assist\".\n\nHe added: \u201cI know there will be various reasons for being reluctant to get involved but please, please think about the fact that Dom and Ben have been killed and how you would feel if this was your family.\n\n(Image: Vagner Vidal/Hyde News & Picture)\n\n\u201cI imagine you would want justice and you wouldn\u2019t want people to get away with what they have done. I am sure you would want justice for your own family.\n\n\u201cI would ask therefore for you to think about this and do the right thing.\"", "description": "A boy from Milton Keynes is being held on suspicion of murder after two others appeared in court charged over the deaths of Dom Ansah and Ben Gillham-Rice", "authors": ["Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Thames Valley Police", "Pa", "Vagner Vidal Hyde News", "Pictures Ltd", "Cliff Hide Lnp", "Picture"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20660619.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_PAY-Double-murder-hunt-as-teenage-boys-stabbed-to-death.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
