Three weeks earlier Bayern Munich had racked up seven Champions League goals against Spurs, the kind of total that tips a bad home defeat into something quite different and that memory has still not entirely been put to bed.\n\nWhere does this win leave Spurs? This was their first victory in three Champions League group games this season and only their second of any kind in their last eight matches. The opposition were astonishingly inadequate at times, and that has to be taken into consideration when assessing what a full-strength Spurs team achieved, but even so they were good to watch. Kane now has 15 goals in 15 games for club and country, and Son Heung-min was back to his best.\n\nIt means that the Champions League last 16 is now an achievable prospect if Spurs can beat Red Star Belgrade on Nov 6 in Serbia, where the opposition\u2019s record makes them a very different prospect to the poorly-organised bunch who showed up in north London. \u201cThe competition does not wait for anyone,\u201d Mauricio Pochettino said later of Spurs\u2019 slow start to the Champions League this season, but in truth it has waited for them and, now they are aboard, second place is within their grasp.\n\nBefore all that is Sunday\u2019s trip to Liverpool where Pochettino declared his team ready to have \u201cthe confidence to go there and have a good performance\u201d which is the very least that he will need against the side that beat them in the Champions League final in June. There was encouragement from the performance of Son, among others, who scored twice and was chasing his hat-trick when he departed on half a lap of honour around the pitch on 68 minutes.", "description": "For the second time this season there was a Champions League hammering at the gleaming new stadium on Tottenham high road, although this time it was the club considered to be in the throes of an early-season crisis who were administering the medicine.", "authors": ["Sam Wallace", "Jake Goodwill", "Chief Football Writer", "Live Updates", "Sam Dean", "Ipek Tugcu"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/22/TELEMMGLPICT000213820423-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqG-y5hWvlxXJvZ9P2yIBc3D8UO8xZVPVH8b3PD3-Pedw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
