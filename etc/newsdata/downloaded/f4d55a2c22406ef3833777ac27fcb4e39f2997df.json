It had yellowish brown fur, powerful jaws, and a pouch for its young like a kangaroo.\n\nOne of the recent sightings was reported by a Western Australian couple visiting Tasmania in February who said they saw one of the creatures crossing the road near their car.\n\nThe animal \"turned and looked at the vehicle a couple of times\" and \"was in clear view for 12-15 seconds,\" their report read. Both people in the car \"are 100% certain that the animal they saw was a thylacine.\"\n\nIt had stripes down its back, according to the report.\n\nA captive Tasmanian tiger at the Hobart Zoo in 1933.

The driver \"seemed certain that, if it was a cat, it was a bloody big one,\" the report noted.\n\nMost recently, in July, a man near Hobart in southeastern Tasmania reported seeing a footprint that seemed to match that of the Tasmanian tiger.\n\nThe creature, native to both Tasmania and the Australian mainland, was the only member of the Thylacinidae family to survive into modern times, according to the Australian Museum. European colonists in the 19th century killed thousands of thylacines for attacking sheep, which most likely contributed to the species' demise.\n\nIn 2002, scientists at the Australian Museum replicated thylacine DNA, opening the door to potentially reviving the species with cloning technology.", "description": "A document released by the Australian government lists eight reported sightings of a Tasmanian tiger \u2014 a creature thought to be extinct.", "authors": ["Jane Dalton", "The Independent"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da87e9acc4a0a57625338a3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
