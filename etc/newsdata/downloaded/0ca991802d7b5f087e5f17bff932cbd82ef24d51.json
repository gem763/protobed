They\u2019ll stay off work for at least a couple more days while union committees decide if they will bless the deal. Then workers will have to vote on it.\n\nThe deal shows that the union, with less than one-third of the 1.5 million members it had at its peak in 1979, still has a lot of clout with GM, Ford F, +0.00% and Fiat Chrysler FCAU, +1.28% .\n\n\u201cI think economically the UAW will do just fine in this agreement,\u201d said Art Schwartz, a former GM negotiator who now is a labor consultant in Michigan. \u201cThe union certainly still has power in this industry.\u201d\n\nThe strike immediately brought GM\u2019s U.S. factories to a halt, and within a week, started to hamper production in Mexico and Canada. Analysts at KeyBanc investment services estimated the stoppage cut GM vehicle production by 250,000 to 300,000 vehicles. That\u2019s too much for the company to make up with overtime or increased assembly line speeds. Analysts say the costs to GM will hit around $2 billion.\n\nWorkers, on the other hand, lost north of $3,000 each on average, the difference between their base wages and $250 per week in strike pay from the union.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see there\u2019s a deal, but without knowing the details I\u2019m a little skeptical because we don\u2019t know the highlights or the lowlights,\u201d said worker Nick Kuhlman, who was among the strikers huddled around a burn barrel on a blustery, gray Toledo afternoon.\n\n\u201cI just hope it gets done,\u201d said Toledo worker Mark Nichols, who thought the strike would last only a week or two and was ready to get back to work because his savings are running low.\n\nGM apparently was able to close three of four factories that it wanted to shutter to get rid of excess capacity in slow-selling cars and components. The Detroit-Hamtramck plant will get a new electric pickup truck and stay open, but factories in Lordstown, Ohio; Warren, Michigan; and near Baltimore are to be closed. The Lordstown area will get an electric vehicle battery factory, but it won\u2019t have nearly as many workers as the assembly plant that for years made compact GM cars.\n\nThe deal now will be used as a template for talks with GM\u2019s crosstown rivals, Ford and Fiat Chrysler. Normally the major provisions carry over to the other two companies and cover about 140,000 auto workers nationwide. It wasn\u2019t clear which company the union would bargain with next, or whether there would be another strike.\n\nSchwartz said depending on the contents, the GM contract could influence wages and benefits in other industries. But he said foreign automakers with U.S. factories, mainly in the South, will give modest pay raises regardless of the GM contract, and shouldn\u2019t be affected much.\n\nClarence Trinity, a worker at GM\u2019s engine and transmission plant in the Detroit suburb of Romulus, Michigan, said the deal sounds good, \u201cbut I have to see it in writing or hear from the leaders.\u201d\n\nTrinity said he can\u2019t figure out why it took 31 days for the strike to end. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what General Motors was expecting to get out of us. Maybe they didn\u2019t expect us to strike. Maybe they didn\u2019t expect us to strike this long.\u201d\n\nIf all of the committees bless the deal, it\u2019s likely to take several days for GM to get its factories restarted.\n\nMatt Himes, a worker at the GM plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, heard news of the deal in Ohio, where he\u2019s trying to help his wife sell their house after the Lordstown GM plant where he used to work was shuttered.\n\nHe hopes good news keeps coming. If they can sell their house, his wife can finally move south with him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud that we stuck our ground and everybody stuck together,\u201d Himes said of the union workers during a phone interview. \u201cAnd I\u2019m relieved that hopefully it worked out, got us a good contract and we can move on and get back to work making cars like we should be.\u201d\n\nWall Street investors liked news that the strike could end. GM shares jumped 2.6% just after the news broke, but eased back to close up 1% at $36.65.\n\nGM and the union have been negotiating at a time of troubling uncertainty for the U.S. auto industry. Driven up by the longest economic expansion in American history, auto sales appear to have peaked and are now heading in the other direction. GM and other carmakers are also struggling to make the transition to electric and autonomous vehicles.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China and his tariffs on imported steel and aluminum have raised costs for auto companies. A revamped North American free trade deal is stalled in Congress, raising doubts about the future of America\u2019s trade in autos and auto parts with Canada and Mexico, which last year came to $257 billion.\n\nAmid that uncertainty, GM workers have wanted to lock in as much as they can before things get ugly. They argue that they had given up pay raises and made other concessions to keep GM afloat during its 2009 trip through bankruptcy protection. Now that GM has been nursed back to health \u2014 earning $2.42 billion in its latest quarter \u2014 they wanted a bigger share.\n\nThe union\u2019s bargainers have voted to recommend the deal to the UAW International Executive Board, which will vote on the agreement. Union leaders from factories nationwide will travel to Detroit for a vote on Thursday. The earliest workers could return would be after that.\n\nIn past years, it\u2019s taken a minimum of three or four days and as long as several weeks for the national ratification vote.\n\nThis time around \u2014 with a federal corruption investigation that has implicated the past two UAW presidents and brought convictions of five union officials \u2014 many union members don\u2019t trust the leadership. But they\u2019re also tired of striking and may return before they vote on the deal themselves.\n\nThe strike had shut down 33 GM manufacturing plants in nine states across the U.S., and also took down factories in Canada and Mexico. It was the first national strike by the union since a two-day walkout in 2007, and the longest since a 54-day strike in Flint, Michigan, in 1998 that also halted most of GM\u2019s production.", "description": "On the picket lines at a General Motors transmission plant in Toledo, Ohio, passing cars honked and striking workers celebrated a tentative contract deal by...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT468_gmstri_ZG_20191016183039.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
