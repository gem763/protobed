Evercrisp is one of our new ones out and was kind of excited to share that with people.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Oct. 6, the apples on Spicer Farms supplemental orchard - located at U.S. 23 and Clyde Road in Hartland - were reportedly not quite ripe yet. The owners usually check their crops every four days, so on Oct. 9, they decided to check again, according to ABC 7.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing there,\u201d Ryan Spicer, the grandson of Alan Spicer, the farm's founder discovered.\n\nRyan says Alan called the Genesee County Sheriff Department shortly after to report the theft.\n\nSISTERS REUNITED AFTER 75 YEARS THANKS TO ONLINE DNA TEST\n\nMatthew says he believes someone harvested the crops in the middle of the night because the neighbors claim they didn't see anything. The farm reportedly had cameras, but they were pointing away from the crops during the robbery due to it being hunting season, according to WDIV.\n\n\u201cIt would have had to be three or four trucks,\u201d Matthew told ABC 7 after the owner reportedly found tire tracks in the grass. \"[It would] have to be somebody who would not have to distinguish between ripe and not ripe apples. Because they took them both.\"\n\nRyan added that the job would have most likely required a \"crew of nine.\"\n\nThe Spicer family has run the orchard for over 50 years and they've never experienced a robbery like this.\n\n\u201cThink about how much time and effort that farmer puts into his crop, and when he doesn\u2019t have a crop, how many times does that have to happen then he cant do what he does,\u201d Ryan told the outlet.\n\nCLICK FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nInvestigators aren't sure if the theft is related to the 400 pumpkins stolen from an orchard in St Clair County 's Grant Township or 50,000 apples stolen from an Indiana orchard last month.", "description": "A\u00a0Michigan farming family is in disbelief after they say 22,000 apples, which equates to roughly 7,000 pounds of fruit,\u00a0were stolen from their orchard between late Sunday night and Wednesday morning.", "authors": ["David Aaro", "David Aaro Is A Freelance Reporter At Fox News Digital Based In New York City."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/spicers-orchard-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
