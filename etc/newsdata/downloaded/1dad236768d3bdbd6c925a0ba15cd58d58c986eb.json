The product\u2019s regulation is so lax that even those in the industry have voiced concerns, the Chicago Tribune reported.\n\n\u201cWe were really unnerved by the lack of consistency and regulation, and the wide variety of manufacturing processes that companies were using,\u201d said Coco Meers, co-founder of Chicago-based CBD company Equilibria.\n\nMeers said CBD products can contain harmful pesticides or heavy metals and may not have the promised amount of cannabidiol.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, everything gets called CBD, but all CBD is not created equal,\u201d Meers said.\n\nChicago-based LeafyQuick, a retailer of CBD products, only sells products that have been tested, said co-founder Rahul Easwar.\n\n\u201cWhen we tell them, \u2018Hey, this is third-party tested,\u2019 it\u2019s more like, \u2018OK great, but tell me what flavor you have,\u2019\u201d Easwar said. \u201cIt\u2019s more of an afterthought or it\u2019s not a thought at all.\u201d\n\nThe bill would require any untested products to be removed from store shelves and online shops, according to Rep. Bob Morgan, who introduced it in the state legislature Oct. 2.\n\nPotential fines start at $1,000 and increase with more violations. The fines would go to a newly created CBD Safety Fund to be used for enforcement.\n\n\u201cThis legislation would give the Department of Agriculture the ability to step in to make sure we are selling products that are safe for people to use,\u201d said Morgan, a Democrat representing the Chicago suburb of Deerfield.\n\nLegal CBD has become ubiquitous in many of its forms, whether it\u2019s cream, bath bomb or gummy bears. Last year, President Donald Trump\u2019s signed a farm bill that legalized the cultivation of industrial hemp, from which CBD can be derived.\n\nSince then, business has boomed. Sales of CBD products in the U.S. are expected to reach $5 billion this year - a more than 700% increase from last year, according to Chicago-based cannabis research firm Brightfield Group. By 2023, the market could grow to $23.7 billion.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Chicago Tribune, http://www.chicagotribune.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A proposed bill would require all CBD products sold in Illinois to meet testing requirements that would be developed by the state Department of Agriculture.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
