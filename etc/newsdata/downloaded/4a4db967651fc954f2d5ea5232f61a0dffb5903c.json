Recommendations are separate from any business incentives.\n\nBased on aesthetics alone, there is no better time to own a dog than around Halloween, if for no other reason than the chance to outfit them in the cutest costumes.\n\nBut Halloween can also be dangerous for dogs. Easily accessible candy, lit candles in Jack-o-Lanterns, and even ill-fitting costumes are all potential hazards for your pooch. Don\u2019t fret: Take these actions, recommended by experts, so that a spooky and safe time is had by all.\n\nKeep them away from the candy bowl\n\nCredit: Getty Images / mediaphotos Keep your dog out of the candy bowl at all costs.\n\nYou probably already know this, but it bears repeating: Chocolate is toxic for dogs. That\u2019s because it contains caffeine and theobromine (a chemical that\u2019s similar to caffeine). Dogs can\u2019t metabolize these substances as well as humans, according to VCA Animal Hospitals, so ingesting anything that contains them could be fatal. The darker the chocolate, the more theobromine and caffeine are present.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome signs of theobromine poisoning in pets include excessive drooling, vomiting, diarrhea, increased thirst, a racing heart rate, and frequent urination. If your dog gets into your Halloween chocolate, and starts exhibiting those signs, call the vet right away.\n\nIf you\u2019re giving out or receiving sugar-free candy or gum instead of chocolate, make sure your dog can\u2019t get into that supply, either. \u201cSugar-free candies containing the sugar substitute xylitol can cause serious problems in pets,\u201d says Hyunmin Kim, DVM, veterinary staff manager, at the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Xylitol is toxic for dogs because it triggers the release of insulin from the pancreas, which can cause hypoglycemia, liver failure, and seizures if left untreated.\n\nMake sure the Jack-O-Lantern is out of reach\n\nCredit: Getty Images / knape Jack-o-Lanterns are fun to look at, but not ideal for your pooch to snack on.\n\nKeep your carved pumpkins on a high ledge that your dog can\u2019t reach, or on a porch your dog doesn\u2019t have access to. \u201cWhile a carved jack-o-lantern certainly is festive, pets can easily knock over a lit pumpkin and start a fire,\u201d says Kim. Even safer (for pets and humans alike) is to get a battery-powered candle instead. The ones that flicker mimic the real thing, minus the fire hazard.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYou\u2019ll also want to make sure your dog doesn\u2019t get its paws\u2014and teeth\u2014on the Jack-O-Lantern\u2019s own gaping grin, or any other decorative fall veggies such as gourds or corn. \u201cPopular Halloween plants such as pumpkins and decorative corn are considered relatively nontoxic, but can produce stomach discomfort in pets who nibble on them,\u201d says Kim.\n\nGet them a costume they like wearing\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser Make sure dog likes being in their costume (almost) as much as you like seeing them in it.\n\nYes, forcing your pooch into a Baby Shark or Harry Potter costume is a great way to achieve maximum holiday adorableness. But, according to Kim, costumes can cause \u201cundue stress\u201d in some pets, particularly if they are already on the anxious side. Because of this, the ASPCA discourages putting your pet in a costume unless you know they won\u2019t mind it.\n\nThere are a few ways to ensure your pet feels good in their costume. Try on the costume (or a few of them) before Halloween and have your dog model it for you so you can see how they look and how they handle it. \u201cIf he or she seems distressed or shows abnormal behavior, consider letting your pet wear his or her \u2018birthday suit\u2019 or don a festive bandana instead,\u201d says Kim.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf you decide to go forward with the costume, make sure it doesn\u2019t have any small, dangling, or easy-to-chew-off pieces that could become a choking hazard. You\u2019ll also want to observe at your dog\u2019s mobility in the ensemble. \u201cMake sure the costume does not limit his or her movement, sight, or ability to breathe or bark,\u201d says Kim. \u201cIll-fitting outfits can get twisted on external objects or your pet, leading to injury.\u201d\n\nKeep them close, whether you\u2019re trick-or-treating or staying home\n\nCredit: Getty Images / svetikd Keep your dog in a cozy place when trick-or-treaters come by.\n\nIncluding your pet in Halloween festivities can be a lot of fun. But if you take them out while trick-or-treating with the kids, ensuring their collar and ID tag are up-to-date and fully visible is non-negotiable. With all the excitement going on, there\u2019s no telling what they might get lost or caught up in. \u201cA collar with ID tags and/or a microchip can be a lifesaver for a lost pet,\u201d says Kim.\n\nIf you stay in with your pet to greet trick or treaters, Kim has some safety advice for you, too. \u201cAll but the most social dogs should be kept in a separate room away from the front door as too many strangers can often be scary and stressful for them,\u201d she says. Not to mention, some trick-or-treaters may be afraid of dogs, no matter how friendly or sweet yours is. If you don\u2019t pen up your pet, when you open the door for guests, make sure your dog doesn\u2019t dart outside. If your dog gets nervous (or bark-happy) from excessive doorbell rings and knocks, Kim suggests leaving a bowl of candy outside for the trick-or-treaters with a note requesting they not ring the bell. Sure, you\u2019ll have to trust guests to take your advice to \u201cjust take one,\u201d but your dog will be safe and happy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
