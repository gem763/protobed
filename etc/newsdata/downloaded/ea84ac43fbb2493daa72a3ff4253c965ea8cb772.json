What the study found: They would be willing to pay more for airline tickets if it meant helping the environment.\n\nThe study, conducted with the Environmental Defense Fund, surveyed more than 1,800 U.S. participants online and assessed their reactions to a $14 carbon fee that was \"presented to them in several different ways at the time of a hypothetical ticket purchase.\" Knowing the extra money would be used to address carbon emissions, participants responded happily \u2014 but how the fee was written was key to their willingness to pay it.\n\nParticipants responded better when the fee was described as a \"carbon offset,\" rather than a tax, and when the carbon pricing was directed at airplane fuel producers rather than consumers.\n\nFor example, the majority of participants chose the more expensive flight ticket with a fee described as a \"carbon offset for aviation fuel production and import\" over a flight ticket with a fee described as a \"carbon tax for airplane travel.\" They even chose the former over cheaper flight tickets that had no $14 fee attached to them at all, further indicating an inclination to pay the price for polluting the environment.", "description": "A new study from the University of British Columbia Sauder School of Business found that travelers would pay more for airline tickets if it meant helping the environment.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Gravier"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106116504-1567788648572gettyimages-639318992.jpeg?v=1570825355", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
