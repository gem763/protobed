He\u2019s wrong | Lynsey Hanley", "language": "en", "text": "Not long after the referendum in 2016, some neighbours suddenly erected a big wooden fence around their front garden. Well, it seemed sudden. Our postman jokingly called it \u201cthe Brexit wall\u201d, and although the two events may have been entirely unconnected, the fence took on a symbolism it was probably never intended to have.\n\nWhether it was there for reasons of privacy, security, or simply to have something for the ivy to grow on, we\u2019ll never know. I don\u2019t like to ask. But the fence reinforced my belief that community life has never been, and never will be, as straightforward as some dewy-eyed nostalgics would like to present it. That thought recurred this week, as the country staggers towards a general election. Whenever it does finally take place, both the Tories and Labour will make a pitch \u2013 in the Midlands and the north of England particularly \u2013 on the presumption that the leave vote represented a desire to take things back to how they supposedly once were.\n\nThe fence incident, and the sense of privacy and desire for individual space it seemed to suggest, reminds me of many of the interviewees featured in the historian Jon Lawrence\u2019s new book, Me, Me, Me? The Search for Community in Postwar England. In it, Lawrence rescues dozens of voices from dusty transcripts buried in university libraries to build a picture of how British people have felt about their lives and the places they live in over many decades.\n\nWhen government fails and basic needs go unmet, people turn in on themselves and try to look after their own as best they can\n\nThese are not vox pops. In successive studies people were interviewed at length, over many months, at work and at home, and encouraged to put across their side of the extraordinarily complex story of postwar society. What they reveal, unsurprisingly, is that people hate being told what to do: whether by family members, neighbours, bosses, colleagues or politicians.\n\nBut at the same time they do want to feel supported. When government fails and basic needs go unmet, people turn in on themselves and try to look after their own as best they can. The idea that community is bolstered by character-building hardship is a myth. An unemployed Sheppey couple interviewed by the sociologist Ray Pahl in 1982 told him that when it was a struggle to maintain family life, it made you \u201csort of more narrow\u201d. In Lawrence\u2019s words, \u201cthe outside world ceased to matter when they were struggling to survive\u201d.\n\nLawrence reminds us of what we should never forget: that to experience class at the \u201cwrong\u201d end of the scale \u2013 the economically difficult, culturally denigrated, politically marginalised end \u2013 is a constant struggle against visible and invisible forces. People\u2019s ambitions for themselves, their families and their neighbourhoods are vulnerable to attack from a combination of wilful inaction and deliberate destructiveness from government.\n\nIt was undoubtedly resentment at such malign neglect over past decades that drove much of the Brexit vote in 2016, among traditionally Labour working-class communities in the north of England and the Midlands.\n\nBut the result has been a series of tired popular narratives about the role of place in forming our identity, the most common being the idea that certain places have been \u201cleft behind\u201d \u2013 a term that conjures up a vision of areas filled with people who are bewildered and marooned in a changing world. Those places haven\u2019t been left behind, but deliberately held back. The people in them are desperate to vote for a party that is fundamentally optimistic about our ability to cope with change and knows what it has to do to make it possible. Labour\u2019s 2017 election manifesto did this. It boosted the turnout and won the party over 40% of the vote. That will not stop the Conservatives attempting to mount a land-grab of supposedly \u201cleft-behind\u201d Brexit voters. (It was no accident that Boris Johnson chose Wakefield as the backdrop for his rambling speech yesterday.)\n\nA recent report by the right-leaning thinktank Onward entreated Tories to place more emphasis on \u201cthe politics of belonging\u201d, suggesting that \u201cvoters do not want more autonomy, choice and mobility. They want a government that \u2026 protects them, their families and British businesses from the modern world.\u201d\n\nDo they mean the same modern world in which the British use smartphones, social media and cashless payments more than anyone else? The problem is not modernity, or nostalgia for an idealised close-knit \u201ccommunity\u201d. People desperately want the feeling of autonomy, but are intelligent enough to recognise that autonomy isn\u2019t possible without an underpinning of material security. And they are not going to get that under the Tories, whatever guise the party takes under the shape-shifting Johnson, and whatever pre-election bungs are cynically tossed their way by Sajid Javid.\n\nThe Labour party too \u2013 and for a longer period of time \u2013 has been misreading the politics of community. When Ed Miliband was leader at the start of this decade he convened a lot of workshops and roundtables with advisers and MPs, asking: \u201cWhat should Labour conserve?\u201d In 2011 was invited to one of them, and I once got into a barney with two MPs who insisted that Miliband\u2019s emphasis on universal benefits would lose Labour \u201cthe white working class\u201d for ever if they felt that migrants and recent arrivals in communities were given equal treatment to longstanding residents. \u201cIt\u2019s about community, and social cohesion, and values,\u201d they blustered. What right had I to challenge the idea that the white working class \u2013 as they chose to define it \u2013 were right about all things at all times?\n\nTheir approach was to paint Labour\u2019s problem as cultural \u2013 an inability to understand \u201chow the working class thinks\u201d \u2013 rather than one of policy. Labour spent decades accepting the policies that left deindustrialised England battered, bruised and angry. In the 1990s and 2000s it believed that if it spent enough money on welfare and education it would cover the cracks. When the cracks widened and working-class voters began to desert the party, they went for the \u201cculture\u201d explanation.\n\nHow the left lost the fight for Englishness | Suzanne Moore Read more\n\nSuccessful community life is not about who chats to whom on the doorstep or about mystical working-class values. It is about whether the essential needs of everyone in that community are met to the extent that they can look beyond that day\u2019s survival and outwards towards others. In Lawrence\u2019s wise words, \u201cthe task for politicians is to imagine the conditions which will enable people most fully to reconcile self and society in their daily lives\u201d.\n\nSo when the Conservative party sends their representatives to court the working-class vote, they should be asked a few questions. Have they ever tried to apply for benefits to which they are entitled, or sought help from Citizens Advice? Have their local branch library and children\u2019s centre been closed? Have they ever tried to get a bus on a Sunday, or after 8pm, outside London? Have they noticed that children no longer play out on the street? Have they ever peeled \u201cFree Tommy Robinson\u201d stickers off the bus shelter and the playground gates? What did they feel on visiting any city centre and seeing the lines of destitute people trying to keep their tents pegged to the pavement and their sleeping bags clean?\n\nThe very idea of a culture war, invoking supposed working-class values, is empty. What we are really talking about is quality of life. The problem of our times and our communities is that a full, rich life, free of avoidable stresses, in which the right to stay and the right to move are equally taken for granted, now feels so hard to achieve for so many people.\n\n\u2022 Lynsey Hanley is a writer and the author of Estates: an Intimate History and Respectable: Crossing the Class Divide", "description": "Most leave supporters are not pining for a mythical lost community.
