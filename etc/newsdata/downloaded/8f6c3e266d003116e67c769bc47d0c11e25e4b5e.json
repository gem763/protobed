The question came during a bilateral meeting at the United Nations between Trump, other administration officials, and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\n\"Well, they're starting to buy a lot of our ag product,\" Trump said. \"But Steven, could you maybe,\" the president said, referring to Mnuchin.\n\nMnuchin then said, \"That was actually at our request they delayed that.\"\n\n\"So, we didn't want there to be any confusion. They have started buying agriculture,\" the Treasury chief continued. \"They're going to reschedule that at a different time. The timing didn't work. But that was \u2014 that was purely at our request.\"\n\nTrump then asked Mnuchin, \"Why was that our request, just out of curiosity?\"\n\nThe president punctuated that question with a chuckle that seemed to indicate displeasure \u2014 or unease \u2014 more than humor.\n\nMnuchin started to answer, \"We didn't want confusion around the trade issues.\"\n\nTrump quickly interjected, \"Yeah, but I want them to buy farm products.\"\n\nMnuchin then responded, \"There was no confusion, we want them to buy agriculture. They've committed to buy agriculture. And they're doing that.\"\n\nTrump added, \"They've committed to buy a lot of agriculture, and they're going to start, and they've started.\"\n\n\"And we should get them over there as soon as possible so they can start buying,\" the president said.\n\nTrump has a history of contradicting Mnuchin in public about various issues, including on alleged currency manipulation by China, linking security concerns about the technology company Huawei with trade talks with China, and on setting conditions for negotiations with Iran.", "description": "President Trump was taken aback when Treasury chief Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. asked China's trade delegation to reschedule a farm tour.", "authors": ["Dan Mangan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106136105-1568811357342gettyimages-1151703245.jpeg?v=1569276072", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
