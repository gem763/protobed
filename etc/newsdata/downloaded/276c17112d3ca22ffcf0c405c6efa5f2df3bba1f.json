Patrick McHenry (R-NC) urged lawmakers to hear Zuckerberg out \u2014 and avoid a knee-jerk reaction that could hinder innovation going forward.\n\n\u201cToday is a trial on American innovation,\u201d said McHenry. \u201cPoliticians enabled by special interests and a lack of understanding of new tech use fear to justify what is ultimately a power grab. New laws, new regulation but ultimately old and tired ways to centralize power here in Washington.\u201d\n\nStill, McHenry acknowledged concerns about what the company is doing. \u201cI have my qualms about Facebook and Libra \u2014 I do. And the shortcomings of big tech. There are many, yes, there are. But if history has shown us anything, it\u2019s better to be on the side of innovation, competition,\u201d said McHenry.\n\nScrutiny over Libra\n\nZuckerberg began his opening remarks talking about the benefits of Libra, though he acknowledged Facebook is not the \u201cideal messenger\u201d for the project, given the past \u201cchallenging\u201d few years. He told lawmakers the \u201cfinancial industry is stagnant\u201d and Libra can help the United States \u201cextend its financial leadership.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI actually don\u2019t know if Libra is going to work, but I believe it\u2019s important to try new things \u2014 as long as you\u2019re doing so responsibly. That\u2019s what has made America successful and it\u2019s why our tech industry as led the world,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nZuckerberg tried to assure a skeptical committee, by saying Facebook will not be part of a Libra launch that doesn\u2019t have the approval of U.S. regulators. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-MI) forced Zuckerberg to get more specific, by asking what would happen if the Libra Association decided to launch without U.S. approval.\n\nFacebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg confers with members of his team prior to testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Capitol Hill October 23, 2019 in Washington, DC.

That\u2019s the goal and that\u2019s the plan.\u201d\n\n\n\nRep. Nydia Velazquez asked Zuckerberg if he would commit to a moratorium on Libra until Congress can develop a legal framework for regulators.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy understanding is that Congress exercises significant oversight over the regulators through these committees. So that would seem to me like the appropriate way for that to happen,\u201d said Zuckerberg.\n\n\u201cSo that is a no,\u201d replied Velazquez.\n\n\n\nRep. Ann Wagner (R-MO) pressed Zuckerberg on why several companies recently backed out of the Libra Association.\n\n\u201cI think because it\u2019s a risky project. There\u2019s been a lot of scrutiny,\u201d said Zuckerberg.\n\n\n\nSeveral lawmakers grilled Zuckerberg on Facebook\u2019s credibility and trustworthiness. Zuckerberg acknowledged the company has work to do in order to build trust.\n\nRep. Al Green (D-TX) asked Zuckerberg about the diversity within the Libra Association \u2014 but Zuckerberg was not able to tell the congressman how many women, minorities or members of the LGTBQ community are involved in the project.", "description": "Chairwoman Maxine Waters kicked off the House Financial Services hearing with a blistering rebuke of Facebook and its plans for a cryptocurrency.", "authors": ["Jessica Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/P.l9M9dyswdPhB0LGAx0AQ--~B/aD0zNzEyO3c9NTU2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/cd9ebc30-f5a2-11e9-b4fc-b9f241fb19f8", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
