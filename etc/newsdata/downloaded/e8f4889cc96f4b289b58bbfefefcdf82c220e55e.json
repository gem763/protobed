Their commitment to training in grueling, close-quarters competition makes them comfortable in the uncomfortable.\n\nBut, as a youngster, Bellator light heavyweight contender Yannick Bahati had to get comfortable with one the most uncomfortable situations anyone could ever find themselves in.\n\n\u201cI was born in the Congo, the DRC,\u201d he told MMA Junkie ahead of his main event appearance at Bellator Europe 5 on Oct. 12. \u201cIn the Congo, there was a lot of war. I\u2019ve been involved in three wars as a youngster and have seen young men die in front of my own eyes.\u201d\n\nThankfully for Bahati (9-4 MMA, 1-0 BMMA), his family was eventually able to get themselves out of the country and away from danger and, with young Bahati still only 10 years ld, they moved to the United Kingdom in search of a fresh, safe start.\n\n\u201cLiving in the Congo isn\u2019t the best, or the safest, environment for a young kid,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo my parents decided they wanted a better life for us and we eventually moved to the U.K.\u201d\n\nBahati, who at the time could speak Swahili and French, but not English, found himself involved in fights both in school and on the street as he struggled to come to terms with day-to-day life in his new country. But eventually, he found his feet, by working his hands.\n\n\u201cIn my early teens \u2013 15, 16 years old \u2013 I started doing boxing and competing as an amateur in the ABAs (Britain\u2019s amateur boxing championships) and the nationals,\u201d he explained. \u201cEventually, when I was 19, I moved to Birmingham for university, and while I was there I started learning mixed martial arts with the same team as Leon Edwards. We started almost at the same time and we\u2019ve been training together from the start.\u201d\n\nAlongside Edwards and his brother, Bellator middleweight contender Fabian, UFC middleweight Tom Breese, former UFC athletes Vaughan Lee and Paul Taylor, plus Cage Warriors middleweight title challenger Nathias Frederick and EFC flyweight champion Jake Hadley, Bahati is part of a formidable lineup of talent that trained closely together at Birmingham gym UTC. But when the gym closed its doors for the final time a couple of years ago, Bahati and his teammates collectively took the decision to stick together and make their new home at their grappling gym at Team Renegade.\n\n\u201cWith our gym closing down, we all relocated to Team Renegade,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe used to go there for our grappling, but with UTC closing down we all moved there and we\u2019ve made it more into an MMA gym. The guys are in all the top shows in the world: UFC, Bellator, Cage Warriors, EFC. We\u2019ve got top-quality lads, and that\u2019s the great thing about our gym. We\u2019re all surrounded by great athletes, young guys that are all after the same dream.\u201d\n\nBahati captured the middleweight titles in South African promotion EFC, then British promotion BAMMA before moving up to light heavyweight and signing for Bellator. Now, after picking up a first-round submission finish on his promotional debut, he\u2019s been handed a main event slot in Italy against an MMA legend \u2013 Dutch knockout artist Melvin Manhoef.\n\n\u201cFighting a legend like Melvin Manhoef is a dream come true,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing signed to Bellator exclusively, I had a hit list of who I wanted to fight in the future. I had Alessio Sakara, I had Karl Moore and I also had Melvin Manhoef. For me to get him first, I definitely didn\u2019t expect that. But I\u2019ve just hit the jackpot, so why not?!\u201d\n\nWhile Bahati is excited to face such a big name in his next fight, he revealed his friends and family weren\u2019t quite so happy for him after learning the identity of his upcoming opponent.\n\n\u201cWhen I got offered the fight I was over the moon. I\u2019m fighting Melvin Manhoef, you know? That\u2019s a great name to have on your record,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then when I told my family and my friends: \u2019I\u2019ve got a big fight\u2019, they said: \u2018Who are you fighting?\u2019 And when I said: \u2018Melvin Manhoef\u2019, the look on their faces was hilarious. They were literally petrified for me!\u201d\n\nBut after everything he experienced so early in his life, very little scares 29-year-old Bahati these days, and he said he is fully prepared to step into the cage and take on the fearsome puncher from the Netherlands. \u201cThe Black Mamba\u201d believes his own striking can cause problems for Manhoef (31-14-1 MMA, 3-3 BMMA), but said his grappling may well prove to be the deciding factor on fight night in Milan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up to the challenge. A fight is a fight and Melvin is human, with two arms, two legs, so it ain\u2019t no big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody knows what he brings to the table, I believe he\u2019s got 30 wins, 28 KOs, that\u2019s a 93% knockout ratio. But I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s ever submitted anyone in the past, so that\u2019s something to look at.\n\n\u201cI believe his wrestling defense is very good, and he\u2019s a (BJJ) brown belt, but I believe if the fight hits the floor, I\u2019ll treat him like a white belt \u2013 that\u2019s just the honest truth. Me on top, I\u2019m a handful for anybody. He\u2019s a striker, but he isn\u2019t the most technical striker in the world. I believe my striking is better than his. He\u2019s been chinned and I\u2019ve seen him hit the canvas many, many times.\n\n\u201cI can expose him everywhere. I can expose him on the feet and I can expose him on the floor. Plus, his gas tank ain\u2019t the best. He\u2019s only got one round in him. But, at the end of the day, Melvin\u2019s Melvin, and what he brings is dangerous, dangerous knockout power.\u201d", "description": "Yannick Bahati says he is ready to face, and defeat, fearsome striker Melvin Manhoef in the main event of Bellator Europe 5.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Brian Garcia", "Matt Erickson", "Ken Hathaway", "George Garcia"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/yannick-bahati-bellator-birmingham.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
