We took trains to Sweden to interview Greta, charged our hybrid car at George\u2019s house, used green energy to power the edit and recycled archive footage rather than shooting new.'", "description": "The environmental activists have produced a short film to highlight the need to protect, restore and use nature to tackle the climate crisis", "authors": ["Source", "Gripping Films", "Kate Aronoff", "Nick Lowles"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1216e1321ddb4dc36d83a8121dfb90d51c9415d/136_9_1774_1064/master/1774.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bb6e88b886a228032ed51ed2724de4ce", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
