When the 54-year-old saw three students smoking on campus, he reprimanded them.\n\nAnother teacher who witnessed the incident sent the three teenage boys home. They did, but one of them held tightly onto a grudge against Pengket.\n\nThis unidentified student, 16 years old, went back to his school armed with a knife and unhampered emotions, and waited for Pengket to exit the school. The student immediately pounced on the teacher, stabbed him nine times, and fled the scene. Pengket was rushed to a nearby hospital.\n\n\u201cI heard the way he reprimanded those kids. He wasn\u2019t rough with them. It\u2019s a teacher\u2019s job to intervene for their students\u2019 own good,\u201d Agustin Dumanang, a school staff member who witnessed the incident told local media. \u201cI saw it with my own eyes. It happened so quickly and we were in shock.\u201d\n\nDue to the nine wounds to his chest, Pengket arrived at the hospital in critical condition. He was quickly transferred to another hospital, where he died the same day.\n\n\u201cWe asked for the cooperation of the parents in locating and turning in their son. Roughly four hours after the incident occurred, his family brought him in,\u201d Muhlis Suhani, head of the local police division, told local media.\n\nThe case has reached the Department of Education. \u201cI\u2019ve been to the school and met with the principal. I will soon announce what the Department of Education\u2019s next step will be,\u201d Grace Punuh, the department\u2019s regional head told local media.\n\nPsychologist Orley Chariti Sualang said that acts of killing committed by children can often be explained by the Aggressive Frustration Theory.\n\n\u201cFrustration is the feeling of disappointment that results from hindered goals. The more intense the frustration, the higher the likelihood the individual will commit aggressive acts. The student in question chose to stab his teacher in part because he observed and learned from his environment, possibly from family or friends,\u201d Sualang told local media.", "description": "He fled the scene, but his parents turned him in hours later.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5dafdd3c9d362e0092e27538/lede/1571807042320-Untitled-design-9.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
