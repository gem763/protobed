The Outlook is Stable. Key Rating Drivers The rating upgrade reflects a sustainable improvement in the insurer's capital strength and stronger profitability. YDPIC has a strong capital buffer to support business growth and asset risk. The insurer's capitalisation rose following a CNY1.5 billion issuance of capital supplementary bonds in October 2018. Its capital score in the Fitch Prism Factor-Based Capital Model improved to 'Very Strong' by end-2018 from 'Adequate' at end-2017. Its comprehensive solvency ratio under the China Risk-Oriented Solvency System rose to 250.7% by end-2Q19 after improving to 220.9% as of 4Q18 from 154.1% in 4Q17. Fitch expects YDPIC's Prism score to be maintained at the 'Very Strong' level. Financial leverage was 22.3% at end-June 2019 and Fitch expects it to be in the low 20% range in the near term. YDPIC's profitability has risen, stemming from a better underwriting performance and stable investment income. Fitch expects the insurer to enhance its underwriting results, with growth in a profitable business acquired from its shareholder, State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC, A+/Stable), a state-owned electricity utility corporation, and lower reliance on the motor insurance business. Fitch expects margins in the motor line to remain under pressure amid heightened competition as a result of greater pricing liberalisation in the non-mandatory (commercial) motor insurance business. YDPIC's combined ratio improved to 96.5% in 2018 from 102.4% in 2017, averaging 99.3% during 2016-2018. Consequently, its return on equity stood at 14.5% in 2018 compared with 9.6% in 2017. The rating upgrade also considers YDPIC's 'Moderate' business profile compared with other non-life insurers in China. YDPIC has an adequate business franchise within the domestic non-life sector, alongside diversified distribution channels. Its business portfolio comprises mainly commercial property, which accounted for 42% of gross premiums written in 2018, followed by motor (40%), liability (12%) and engineering (3%). The insurer will continue to underwrite more non-motor risks and estimates approximately 54% of its non-motor premiums will be sourced from SGCC in 2019 (50% in 2018). The ranking results in Fitch scoring YDPIC's business profile at 'bbb+' under the agency's credit-factor scoring guidelines. These considerations give the insurer's IFS rating the benefit of a one-notch uplift from its Standalone Credit Profile because of its ownership by and business support from its ultimate parent, SGCC, which owns 99.43% of YDPIC through a portfolio of fully and majority-owned subsidiaries, including Yingda International Holdings Group Limited. Fitch believes SGCC is likely to provide support to the insurer in times of stress. The insurer's exposure to risky assets is limited, and Fitch expects it to remain manageable. Stocks, long-term equity investments, equity-type funds and investment plans represented 30.5% of its shareholders' equity at end-1H19, compared with 42.5% at end-2018. Fitch believes YDPIC's underwriting capacity and capital strength will continue to rely on reinsurance utilisation due to its dominant commercial property risk exposure. The insurer's catastrophe exposure is reasonably managed through an excess-of-loss treaty to mitigate underwriting volatility or large potential claims from catastrophes, which would weaken its capital base.\n\nRATING SENSITIVITIES Upgrade rating sensitivities include: - A solidifying business profile, including an improvement in operating scale and competitive position, and maintenance of strong profitability such that its combined ratio is below 95%. - A Prism score that is well into the 'Very Strong' category or higher on a sustained basis Downgrade rating sensitivities include: - A significant change in the shareholding structure, with SGCC losing its controlling stake in YDPIC. - A deterioration in YDPIC's capitalisation, with its Prism score falling to the lower end of the 'Strong' level, or the regulatory solvency ratio falling below 200%. - Weakening profitability, with a combined ratio consistently above 103%. - A material increase in its catastrophe exposure in the absence of adequate reinsurance protection ESG Considerations YDPIC has an ESG Relevance Score of 4, considering its large commercial-property insurance portfolio, which is susceptible to earthquake and windstorm risk exposure in China. This has a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the rating in conjunction with other factors. For more information on our ESG Relevance Scores, visit www.fitchratings.com/esg.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).
