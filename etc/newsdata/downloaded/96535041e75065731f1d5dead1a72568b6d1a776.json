But her dreams were dashed when she landed in the hospital for a chemotherapy session at Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, in Hershey, Pa., meaning she would have to miss the \u201cHappiness Begins\u201d concert taking place across the street.\n\nILLINOIS BABY HAS 5-INCH GROWTH REMOVED FROM NECK HOURS AFTER BIRTH\n\n\u201c@Jonasbrothers I was supposed to be at your Hershey concert tomorrow but instead I\u2019m across the street doing chemo :/ If ya\u2019ll wanted to pop in I\u2019ll give you my room #,\u201d Jordan wrote on Instagram on Aug. 30.\n\nHer message quickly spread, catching even the attention of state congressman Scott Perry, who reposted it on his Facebook page and tagged the group.\n\nJordan\u2019s plea worked, and on Saturday, Aug. 31, shortly before the brothers hit the stage, they stopped by her hospital room in Hershey for a surprise visit.\n\nThe trio signed autographs and posted for photos, and Jordan even gave Joe\u2019s wife, Sophie Turner, a handmade \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d-themed bracelet.\n\nBABY BORN 117 DAYS AFTER MOM WAS DECLARED BRAIN DEAD, REPORT SAYS\n\n\u201cI love her so much, so I wanted to give her that,\u201d Jordan told PEOPLE.\n\nSeventeen weeks ago, Jordan shared with her followers on the @ljsworkinprogress Instagram page that her cancer relapsed, and she has a tumor in her lung that was pushing up against her diaphragm and causing pain. She started chemotherapy in May, and shared that it was her sixth recurrence of osteosarcoma, but that her tumor had shrunk by almost 50 percent after two rounds of treatment.\n\nAfter her visit from the Jonas Brothers, she took to her page to thank her supporters for making it happen.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWow.
