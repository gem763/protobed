California has seen at least 63 cases and one of the six deaths reported around the country.\n\nOn Monday, public health officials in Washington confirmed two new cases of severe pulmonary disease linked to vaping, bringing the state\u2019s total cases to three.\n\n\u201cThis is now a statewide outbreak,\u201d said Washington state health officer Kathy Lofy.\n\nAfter six deaths in the US and bans around the world \u2013 is vaping safe?

The public awareness campaign Newsom announced aims to tackle all forms of vaping, he said.\n\n\u201cAs a father of four, this has been an issue that has been brought to the forefront of my consciousness,\u201d he said.\n\nSan Francisco, the home of Juul, became the first US city to ban the sale of e-cigarrettes in June when its board of supervisors unanimously voted in favor of an ordinance to crack down on youth vaping.\n\n\u201cWe spent the 90s battling big tobacco, and now we see its new form in e-cigarettes,\u201d said San Francisco supervisor Shamann Walton. The ban is set to take effect in December.\n\nOnce widely perceived as a safer alternative to cigarettes, a rising tide of lawsuits have been filed against Juul, America\u2019s dominant vape manufacturer.\n\nA federal judge in California is now hearing whether multiple suits should be grouped into one court, like lawsuits filed against opioid manufacturers \u2013 an indication of how large the litigation could become. The so-called multi-district litigation allows one court to hear cases from around the country, companies to settle cases with thousands of plaintiffs simultaneously, and plaintiffs\u2019 cases to move quicker.\n\nA spokesperson for Juul called recent lawsuits \u201cessentially copy and paste unfounded allegations\u201d raised in previous litigation.\n\nAn estimated 9 million adults and 3.6 million US teenagers vape, including 20% of high school students. Last year the US surgeon general called e-cigarette use among youth an epidemic. In August it was reported that the the US Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Juul used deceptive social marketing that targeted minors.\n\nWhile Donald Trump and the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, have announced plans to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, Newsom said he doesn\u2019t have similar executive authority. But he said he wants lawmakers to send him legislation to do so next year. A similar effort failed this year.\n\nBeyond the public awareness campaign, Newsom has directed the state departments of public health and tax and fee administration to explore ways to warn people about the potential dangers of vaping and tackle the sale of illicit products.\n\nHe\u2019s asked the public health department to explore new warning signs at retailers and in advertisements.\n\nOn the tax side, he\u2019s asking officials to consider changing how e-cigarettes are taxed, because they typically face lower taxes than traditional cigarettes. Making the products more expensive to buy could make them harder for teenagers to purchase, he argued.\n\nAgencies contributed reporting", "description": "The state has seen at least 63 cases of vaping-related illnesses as flavored products contribute to a rise in youth smoking", "authors": ["Mario Koran"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88b73d35e985d33e17cbfd7ff0fbc6441157a228/0_24_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f378c409865bfe9aafe8fbbdb7837fa5", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
