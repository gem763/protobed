You'd be nuts.'\"\n\nMaking a significant financial commitment in the ever-changing NBA world also comes with risks.\n\nMcKinnie signed a nine-month apartment lease in the area to cover himself for the entire 2019-20 season before the Warriors let him go. While he quickly landed on his feet in Cleveland, he was forced to pay a \"sizable fee\" to end his lease early, per Letourneau.\n\n\"That was brutal,\" Golden State rookie forward Eric Paschall said of McKinnie's situation. \"Lease agents out here aren't too forgiving.\"\n\nThat's life in Silicon Valley.", "description": "Several members of the  Golden State Warriors  said they are still going through sticker shock while making the transition from Oracle Arena in Oakland to the new Chase Center in San Francisco...", "authors": ["Tim Daniels"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/835/046/hi-res-adb1b1935cf06b203a6442c350a2d744_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
