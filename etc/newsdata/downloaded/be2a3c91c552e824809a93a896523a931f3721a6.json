It wasn\u2019t happening and that message didn\u2019t get across.\n\n\"It was reinforced pretty strongly and in the second half [Hudson-Odoi] managed to get into better positions. Callum\u2019s talent means that he absolutely works hard to run behind people, to get at people, to be inside, be outside and work off the ball, all those things.\n\n\u201cHe needs to learn because if he wants to play week in and week out that is what he is going to have to do.\u201d\n\nAnother Chelsea academy product making his first appearance of the season was Reece James, who missed much of the early season with injury.\n\nStory continues\n\nJames, who starred on loan at Wigan last season, produced an impressive display at right-back, including a stunning long-range goal and two assists.\n\n\"I think he can get much better because he has been out for a long time and sort of played minimal minutes in the [Under] 23s,\" Lampard said.\n\n\"Reece\u2019s performance last year at Wigan, and he was in Team of the Year in the Championship, shows the talent he has got.\n\n\"I think he is going to be a big player for this club, he has got a great player and person to look up to in [Cesar] Azpilicueta, who is in his position and as he improves and works hard, which he will do, he showed his real qualities on the ball today.\u201d", "description": "The Blues winger made his first appearance since suffering a ruptured Achilles tendon in April", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ZfOX4JAsa3cRLXM6n6DUHg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WGqW12YTiTVVzQCQGF9O_w--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/0add1ca91128a6c6015e68a1208e9a03", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
