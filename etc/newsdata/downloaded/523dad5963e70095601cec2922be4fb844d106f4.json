But that\u2019s between Hong Kong and that\u2019s between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China. They\u2019ll have to deal with that themselves. They don\u2019t need advice.\u201d\n\nTrump has also refrained from commenting on China\u2019s internment of over a million Uighur Muslims, despite the fact that his administration has made religious liberty one of its hallmark issues on the international stage.\n\nAt the United Nations general assembly last month, Trump organised a meeting on the subject in the UN headquarters building, clashing with a global summit on the climate emergency on the same day.\n\nIn the keynote speech on religious freedom, Trump did not mention China or the Uighurs at all, leaving it to his officials.\n\nThe assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs, David Stilwell, organised an event at the UN on \u201cthe human rights crisis in Xinjiang\u201d.\n\nAsked whether it made it harder to convince other countries to care about the issue when the US president did not mention it, Stilwell said: \u201cClearly, I don\u2019t speak for the president.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Mike Pence and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, had mentioned it in their own remarks.\n\n\u201cI would take it as it was presented, that this Uighur issue is just \u2013 it\u2019s out there with all the rest of the issues,\u201d Stilwell said.\n\nUS-Chinese trade negotiations are due to resume next week in Washington. Trump referred to the talks this week, when he suggested that Beijing start investigations into the finances of his political opponent, Joe Biden, and the former vice-president\u2019s son, Hunter.", "description": "US officials banned from supporting pro-democracy protests, CNN reports, after personal phone call between Trump and Xi Jinping", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff1884634a8bd694d2b103edc7294db0fddd4b17/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=df59aed5ccafb5fc40712907d4791941", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
