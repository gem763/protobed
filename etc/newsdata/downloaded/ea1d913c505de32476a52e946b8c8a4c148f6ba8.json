An example that perfectly highlights the aforementioned concept is that of the Lightning Network \u2014 a technology that leverages the security of Bitcoin in order to increase the system\u2019s overall tx throughput.\n\nRelated: What Is Lightning Network And How It Works\n\nNow, when dealing with horizontal and vertical scaling, we can see that the former is implemented by adding more clusters or virtual machines to a system \u2014 in order to handle an increasing transaction load. Vertical scaling, on the other hand, is achieved by adding more processing power (or memory) into an existing virtual machine in order to boost processing capacity.\n\nThat being said, the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade has had a lot of hype because it seeks to improve the project\u2019s overall transactional capacity via a number of different design changes \u2014 with one of the primary ones being sharding.\n\nBy implementing these changes, Ethereum\u2019s core framework will be ported from being a single execution environment to having multiple execution environments that will validate transactions asynchronously and in parallel.", "description": "Let\u2019s take a closer look at the core concepts underlying vertical and horizontal scaling", "authors": ["Shiraz Jagati"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1024_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNTUwMzZiYWQ3Zjk3YmMwMGQxMDVjNjYzOTQzNjc2OGEuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
