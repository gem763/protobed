Dan Biggar remains at outside-half after passing all the protocols following his concussion against Australia.\n\n\u201cWhen I told James he was playing and said well done, he replied: \u2018You have finally seen the light, have you?\u2019\u201d continued Gatland. \u201cHe said he was only joking, but I have no problem with a comment like that, not just because I like a bit of banter but it says to me that a player believes in his own ability and thinks he is good enough to be in the side.\u201d\n\nWales will have 10 days since their last match come the kick-off while Fiji will be on a six-day turnaround, but Gatland expects a full-on encounter even though the tier-two nation most fancied after Japan to have a chance of making the knock-out stage are highly likely to be going home \u2013 even if they win \u2013 having lost their first two matches.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\n\u201cThey were really strong in the second half against Georgia and have some real threats,\u201d said Gatland. \u201cWe have to focus on ourselves. Shaun Edwards [the defence coach] has been speaking to the players about the fact we have not put in an 80-minute defensive performance yet. We have started our two games exceptionally well and if we do it again, it will take some of the excitement out of Fiji.\u201d\n\nWales have got history, having been knocked out of the 2007 tournament by Fiji in the final round of the group stage in Nantes, their last match before Gatland took over. \u201cThe breakdown is going to be the crucial area,\u201d said the Fiji coach, John McKee. \u201cWales have been very strong there in the World Cup and we have to make sure we get quick ball.\u201d", "description": "Warren Gatland has broken up Wales\u2019s back-row combination that was pivotal in their opening two victories", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b3937c0d8eac06ea2bad917c6bcadf49a88d350/0_157_5330_3198/master/5330.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3b3e75d224bcd38b43ee313e131a70ff", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
