The new statute recognizes the legitimacy of an advance directive that instructs health care providers to stop hand feeding food and fluid by mouth. Individuals have already been completing such directives in New York and Washington. The Nevada law is the first that explicitly authorizes such instructions.\n\nGrowing fear of late-stage dementia\n\nMany individuals are afraid of living in late-stage dementia when they cannot participate in activities that they find meaningful or enjoyable. For example, by Alzheimer\u2019s Stage 7, individuals need constant supervision and frequently require professional care with activities of daily living such as toileting and bathing. They are unable either to recognize the faces of close friends and relatives or to remember most details of their personal history. They lose the ability to communicate or respond to their environment.\n\nWidely accepted clinical, ethical, and legal rules hold that these individuals may hasten their death by voluntarily stopping eating and drinking (VSED). This clinically and professionally accepted \u201cexit option\u201d entails making a deliberate decision to stop consuming food and fluids.\n\nThis typically leads to a peaceful death in 10 to 14 days.\n\nA significant number of individuals hasten their deaths with VSED in order to avoid living with late-stage dementia. Increasingly, families are documenting these cases in books and films like The Last Ten Days \u2013 Academia, Dementia, and the Choice to Die: A Loving Memoir of Richard A. Brosio.\n\nNeed for advance VSED\n\nUnfortunately, VSED is often an inadequate solution. Since it requires that the individual act before losing capacity, VSED requires that the individual act earlier than they prefer. They must act while they still find life worthwhile. Because it is uncertain when the \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d will close, when the individual will lose capacity, individuals err on the side of acting early.\n\nTo avoid the problem of premature death, many have proposed that individuals complete advance directives that instruct others to stop hand feeding. This is known as \u201cadvance VSED\u201d or \u201cSED by AD.\u201d At least two advocacy organizations (End-of-Life Washington and End-of-Life Choices New York) have developed special advance VSED directives. In 2019, the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine (the primary association for long-term care) issued a special policy statement on advance VSED.\n\nUncertain legal status of advance VSED\n\nNotwithstanding the growth in planning tools and policy statements, the legality of stopping eating and drinking by advance directive remains uncertain. Many states probably permit advance VSED because they use broad language in their health care decisions statues.\n\nFor example, in Minnesota, the relevant statute defines \u201chealth care\u201d as \u201cany care, treatment, service, or procedure to maintain, diagnose, or otherwise affect a person\u2019s physical or mental condition.\u201d This includes hand-feeding because hand feeding is a \u201cservice or procedure\u201d that \u201caffects a person\u2019s physical \u2026 condition.\u201d Since individuals or their agents may refuse any \u201chealth care\u201d in an advance directive, they may refuse hand-feeding of food and fluids by mouth in an advance directive.\n\nStill, clinicians are uncertain whether they may or must honor an advance VSED directive. Indeed, courts in Oregon and British Columbia have recently refused to enforce (purported) advance VSED directives. Consequently, clinicians want more clarity. No such clarification has been forthcoming. Despite efforts in California, Oregon, and other states, no legislature in the world explicitly authorized advance VSED until 2019.\n\nAdvance VSED in Nevada\n\nOn October 1, 2019, Nevada S.B. 121 goes into effect. This bill, signed by Governor Sandoval on June 1, 2019, authorizes a new \u201cdementia directive.\u201d The Legislative Counsel Bureau will codify this section within provisions on durable power of attorney for health care decisions in chapter 162A of the Nevada Revised Statutes.\n\nThe new dementia directive includes an \u201cEnd-of-Life Decisions Addendum Statement of Desires\u201d that permits the individual to choose \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to the following statement: \u201cI want to get food and water even if I do not want to take medicine or receive treatment.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cfood and water\u201d statement addresses VSED, because it is an option framed as an alternative to \u201cmedicine\u201d and \u201ctreatment.\u201d Nevada law considers \u201cartificial\u201d nutrition and hydration as medical treatment. The standard durable power of attorney for health care form refers to artificial nutrition and hydration as \u201ctreatment.\u201d Therefore, the dementia directive\u2019s language contrasting \u201cfood\u201d and \u201cwater\u201d with \u201ctreatment,\u201d clearly references hand feeding or food and fluid by mouth.\n\nIn short, beginning October 1, 2019, individuals may complete a Nevada advance directive that directs healthcare providers not to provide food or fluid by mouth. They may complete a directive for advance VSED.\n\nAdvance VSED outside Nevada\n\nNotably, the legality of advance VSED extends beyond Nevada through reciprocity rules common in advance directive statutes. For example, the California Probate Code provides: \u201cA written advance health care directive . . . executed in another state \u2026 in compliance with the laws of that state \u2026 is valid and enforceable in this state to the same extent as a written advance directive validly executed in this state.\u201d Accordingly, a valid Nevada advance directive is a valid advance directive in California.\n\nMany other states follow the same reciprocity rules. For example, a patient in Minnesota could complete a Nevada dementia directive. That document would constitute a valid advance directive in Minnesota. Therefore, the Minnesota patient may have a clearer right to advance VSED by requesting it in a Nevada dementia directive than by requesting in in a Minnesota advance directive.\n\nLooking ahead to implementation\n\nAuthorizing advance VSED in a statute removes one perceived barrier. But others remain. Two are notable. First, clinicians do not yet have protocols for how to implement VSED for a patient in late-stage dementia. Even if the patient has a valid directive, when do we stop offering food and fluids? How do we ascertain the satisfaction of any \u201ctrigger\u201d conditions the patient specified?\n\nSecond, even after we stop offering food and fluids, other problems may arise. Most problematically, the patient may make gestures or utterances that seem to contradict her prior instructions. Does such communication revoke the advance directive? A recent court case from the Netherlands suggests the answer is \u201cno.\u201d Once the patient reaches late-stage dementia, she is unable to knowingly and voluntarily revoke decisions she made with capacity. But the answer remains uncertain in the United States.\n\nThaddeus Mason Pope is an attorney.\n\nImage credit: Shutterstock.com", "description": "Once the patient reaches late-stage dementia, she is unable to knowingly and voluntarily revoke decisions she made with capacity.
