Today, however, it increasingly appears to be the only place where actual journalism is transacted; albeit, only after the original article has been published.\n\n\u201cReport, then verify\u201d should be the new masthead motto for The New York Times and other news outlets that have lost all semblance of balance and professionalism.\n\nThis phenomenon is especially prominent in articles about President Trump and his administration. A \u201cblockbuster\u201d scoop about the president, or Republicans in general, seems to be followed shortly by an editor\u2019s note clarifying the \u201cfacts\u201d of the story; and, in many cases, repudiating it altogether.\n\nRecall the infamous BuzzFeed article from January, reporting what would have been a devastating blow to Trump, but which was quickly debunked by Robert Mueller himself. And, this week, we see the Times going once again after Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on alleged past sexual misconduct, only to have the crux of the article dunked by a follow-up editor\u2019s note detailing the accuser has no memory of \u2013 wait for it \u2013 the accusations on which the hit piece is based.\n\nEditors blame weak fact checks in the rush to publish first in today\u2019s 24/7 news cycle, but the Mainstream Media\u2019s abhorrent treatment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh made clear the much more disturbing truth; that when it comes to weaponizing bylines against political enemies, facts are irrelevant when the damage of accusations alone will serve nicely.\n\nTo cover themselves and their precious \u201cethics\u201d in this repulsive practice, the Mainstream Media has invented a new term \u2014 \u201ccredibly accused\u201d \u2014 which allows them to go to print with mere allegations rather than take the extra step of substantiating the claims. These New Age Journalists understand that in today\u2019s outrage culture, an accusation is all it takes to get someone or something \u201ccanceled,\u201d especially if such an accusation is deemed \u201ccredible.\u201d And if the accusations eventually fall apart? No worries. They were just reporting that the target was accused, not that he or she was \u201cguilty\u201d; a distinction without a difference to the target of the article.\n\nThis, of course, is entirely the point of \u201ccredibly accused.\u201d In spite of the surface gravitas of the phrase, there is no objective standard to what is considered a \u201ccredible\u201d accusation. It has no meaning other than that a journalist decides to label it \u201ccredible.\u201d Individuals who then read, hear or view it in various media forms, tend to believe it to be true because, after all, it was printed in a newspaper.\n\nIn the past, such circular reporting would have been bounced by editors who still maintained some shred of integrity. Today, however, as in the case of this week\u2019s New York Times Kavanaugh hit piece, such articles appear once and then grow generically from news to opinion sections, and thence into the limitless world of social media.\n\nDoes the reader know the difference? Most times, no; especially when the initial reporting is further fueled by \u201ccredible\u201d political figures who themselves run with the story before they determine its veracity. Back in the newspaper\u2019s headquarters, there is no worry because, once again, the editors and the reporters have created for themselves plausible deniability. They are journalistic cowards who have no care whatsoever for the damage they do to the targets of their faulty reporting; in fact, they likely revel in it.\n\nDid a retraction help restore the life and reputation of the Covington Catholic School kids skewered in the media for racism, when it turned out that they were the victims? And what about Kavanaugh, who once again is dragged through the mud over \u201ccredible\u201d accusations that cannot be recalled even by the supposed accuser? The public by and large will remember only the headline, not the small footnote added days after the original piece with the faux apology.\n\nFor these New Age Journalists, who boast openly that they have a duty and obligation to use their bylines against those who they deem to be dangerous, facts have become irrelevant. It is the cause that matters. After all, in their minds\u2019 eye, they are saving the world, and if there is collateral damage to other individuals along the way, that is to them a small price to pay.", "description": "In a world not that long ago, a newspaper\u2019s \u201cEditor\u2019s .09/18/2019 3:25:07AM EST.", "authors": ["Bob Barr", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/56/1e77a335-8e82-4c2f-9a7d-ba54b80a6a3b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
