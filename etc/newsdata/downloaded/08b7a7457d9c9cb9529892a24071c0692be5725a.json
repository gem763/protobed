A psychologist as well as a priest, he was the longtime head of a key Catholic mental health facility serving sexually abusive priests, has done chaplaincies at the South Pole, worked in intelligence for the U.S. military and dreams of completing a priestly stint at a space station.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m used to dealing with people and their humanity,\u201d Rossetti said Thursday outside the park, which was bustling in the sunshine with security, fans and tourists sniffing around the about-to-be World Series venue. \u201cIn baseball, if you\u2019re batting .300, you\u2019re a star, and that means the other two times you\u2019re striking out. The point is: Hang in there, stay in the fight. And also \u2014 redemption.\u201d\n\nRossetti is just one part of the psychological and religious infrastructure Nats players will tap into, depending on their needs and beliefs. There are other chaplains and outside figures players call on. But given his long tenure, Rossetti deeply understands the spiritual support the Nats need as they face the daunting athletic and spiritual test of playing in Washington\u2019s first World Series since 1933.\n\nWhen Nats\u2019 second baseman Howie Kendrick fumbled in the Nats-Dodgers series in early October (before becoming series MVP), Rossetti talked about the spiritual goal of maintaining hope (\u201cIf you couldn\u2019t do that, you wouldn\u2019t be here now,\u201d he told players). When relief pitcher Aaron Barrett blew out his arm and was injured for a few years, Rossetti talked about how to struggle with anger at God \u2014 while arguing you need God\u2019s help. He has seen many players who sought some higher power after facing something very tough, and others who did so after achieving so much and asking: Is this all there is?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen the team is in town, Rossetti gets to the Park a few hours before games and makes himself available to talk, or give blessings or prayers. On Sundays he celebrates Mass before the game, usually in the press conference room. He visits with players who are injured. Outside the park he does regular priest stuff for Nats players, like baptizes players\u2019 babies, officiates at weddings and tries \"to be a positive presence in their lives.\u201d\n\nThe normally vaunted place a cleric might have in a parish is a bit reversed in the case of a team chaplain. These are high-dollar professional athletes, and on game day \u2014 especially the current game, the World Series \u2014 Rossetti says you \u201ctry not to get in their way when they\u2019re getting ready, don\u2019t bother them. I try to be respectful, don\u2019t intrude, but be present.\u201d\n\nRossetti played sports in high school but was never a huge athlete or sports fan, which, according to the Catholic group that certifies him, makes him ideal for sports chaplain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe like chaplains who have an interest in sports but aren\u2019t sports fanatics. If you don\u2019t know anything about sports, it makes it hard. But if you\u2019re a groupie you aren\u2019t a good chaplain,\u201d said Ray McKenna, president of Catholic Athletes for Christ. \u201cWe\u2019ve had priests who show up to celebrate in team gear. That\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d\n\nRossetti agrees, but it\u2019s not easy in the tornado of the World Series not to be a little star-struck.\n\n\u201cThey seem to have a special spirit,\u201d he said Thursday at the Park. \u201cThat\u2019s why many people think they\u2019ll win. There\u2019s just this joyful, positive, special presence. I mean, God loves both sides. But there is a special spirit.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe knows his place when he addresses the players. He\u2019s still mulling his homily for Sunday \u2014 that is, if the team doesn\u2019t sweep and by Sunday is no longer in D.C.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI try not to preach too much baseball. They don\u2019t need another player; they need the Good News. They need a priest. They don\u2019t need another fan,\u201d he said (in a Nats hat, standing in line in the team store to buy a gray Nats T-shirt).\n\nTall and slim, with a bald head and an easy smile, Rossetti has long been something of a celebrity for a Catholic priest. He has written multiple books about priest wellness, including one in 2011 called \u201cWhy Priests Are Happy\u201d and appears regularly in local and national media on Catholic issues. For many years he led St. Luke Institute, a Silver Spring-based mental health facility focused on priests and women in religious Catholic life facing behavioral issues. He\u2019s now a research associate professor at Catholic University in pastoral care.\n\nAD\n\nAll of his fields of work have involved helping people deal with pressure. When it comes to the Nats\u2019 players, the type of spiritual and psychological support offered is precise, finely tuned. They have to be prepared not to be knocked off their game after an error that could have easily gone either way, he said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe difference between a foul ball and a double down the line is a matter of inches. The slightest edge makes a difference. At the same time, you realize even if you do your best, there\u2019s a certain uncontrollability and randomness to the game. They realize someone else is in charge of life, and it\u2019s not me. God is in charge,\u201d he said.\n\nOne way to cope with challenges and pressure, Rossetti and others in sports ministry said, is through spiritual ritual \u2014 routines that are picked up like tools when needed.\n\nAD\n\nRossetti said one phrase Nats\u2019 players like to say to him is \u201cLiving the dream\u201d \u2014 as in \u201cI\u2019m living the dream, Father.\u201d He understands them to mean it in a spiritual sense: They are grateful to God and know their path isn\u2019t entirely in their control.\n\nJeffrey L. Brown, who is the lead psychologist for the Boston Marathon and runs faith-based trainings for young hockey players, said it helps reduce stress for players when they are aware that their value isn\u2019t 100 percent performance based \u2014 it\u2019s spiritually rooted. A common phrase is \u201can audience of one,\u201d said Brown, who was a college baseball pitcher. \u201cTheir performance isn\u2019t for anyone else, it\u2019s for God.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMcKenna said ministry can vary depending on the sport \u2014 and how aggressive it is. Ministry with high-contact sports like football and hockey, he said, has to wrestle with this question: \u201cIf you\u2019re a Christian, you\u2019re supposed to love everyone, and that\u2019s antithetical to getting out there and smashing your head in.\u201d In baseball, he said, there isn\u2019t that direct contact with the opposition, he said. \u201cAlso, having a strong faith doesn\u2019t make you less aggressive.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn some evangelical circles, a theology called \u201chealth and wealth\u201d \u2014 or prosperity gospel \u2014 is common, which implies that if you accept Jesus, you win. Sports chaplains can tap into those ideas, McKenna said.\n\nEveryone may see God showing presence in sports in different ways. Pinch hitter Gerardo Parra was in an 0-22 slump in May when he requested to change his walk-up song \u2014 the tune each players picks to blare into the stadium as they approach at-bats \u2014 to \u201cBaby Shark.\u201d The old campfire ditty recycled as a global pop tune is now the team\u2019s anthem.\n\nAD\n\n\"I think God send to me,\u201d Parra said recently of choosing the song, according to a recent Post piece.\n\nFor Rossetti, the role of sports chaplain is straightforward: support.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for them is: They want to stay in the majors,\" he said. \"The pressure is already on. No one needs to kick them. Someone like me needs to say: \u2018No matter what you do, God loves you. I hope you win, but even if you lose, as far as I\u2019m concerned these guys are winners.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Monsignor Stephen Rossetti is used to high-pressure gigs as a sex abuse psychologist, intelligence officer", "authors": ["Michelle Boorstein", "Religion Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SxfY3ae883U8EpOPPKGvGz53MOo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/X4X5LLHWQQI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
