The only only movie that\u2019s ever gave me nightmares. So creepy.\"\n\nA fourth said: \"This adoption story is the most bizarre thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\"\n\nThis Morning continues weekdays and Sundays at 10:30am on ITV.", "description": "This Morning fans were left a little creeped out over an unusual story which was very familiar to the plot of horror film Orphan", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Itv", "Kristine Barnett"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20576403.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RLP_MDG_18498JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
