Her campaign handed out signs reading, \u201cAfrican Americans With Warren.\u201d And in smaller print: \u201cBlack issues are American issues.\u201d\n\nBut when Ms. Warren looked out at the audience, she saw mostly white faces. The view reflected perhaps her biggest political challenge as she seeks the Democratic presidential nomination: adding black voters to her base of support.\n\nAfrican-Americans were critical to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton winning competitive primary contests and capturing the nomination. Like those earlier candidates, Ms. Warren faces multiple rivals who may splinter the electorate this winter, and running up the vote margin in predominantly black areas could once again deliver troves of delegates needed for the nomination.\n\nWhile Ms. Warren is rising in polls thanks to support among liberals, women, young people and college-educated whites, black voters, who are the most essential part of the traditional Democratic coalition, have yet to embrace her in large numbers.", "description": "African-Americans were essential to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton winning competitive primaries like Ms. Warren faces in 2020.
