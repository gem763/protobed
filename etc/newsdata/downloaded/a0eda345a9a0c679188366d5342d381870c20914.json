A group usually composed of 200-300 women in Paris, that tonight become three \u2013 four if you include me \u2013 on a mission to raise awareness for the ongoing femicide epidemic in France by tagging walls with slogans around the supposed city of love.\n\nWhen I arrive, Jeanne is indeed making glue; it\u2019s what we\u2019ll use to stick up slogans they prepared at home: \u201cLove \u2260 Kill\u201d, \u201cShe left him, he killed her\u201d, \u201cWe never kill for love\u201d or \u201cNot one more\u201d are a few that Parisians will read tomorrow morning while walking to work. This is not street art, they are not trying to spread love or any philosophical message as artists would do: they are together to denounce the crime of femicide \u2013 where a woman is murdered because she is a woman. In other words, it\u2019s a sex-based hate crime.\n\nSince January, 124 women have been killed by their partner; three more than in 2018. \u201cThe goal is that the government will provide funds to change these problems. But it\u2019s also to alert the young and old to this issue and generate actions such as creating accommodation for women who can\u2019t go home,\u201d says Philomene, another student, who participates in the movement two nights a week. \u201cIt\u2019s also for the charities who are working to change things. Some of them are just not heard. There are people with expertise who can provide statistics but no one hears them \u2013 or wants to listen. It\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhile we march in the dark to stick black letters on the walls of Paris, it becomes clear that there are people around us know who we are. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what you\u2019re doing! I\u2019ve been following you for sometime now. How can I join?\u201d asks a passerby, probably on her way home from a night out. \u201cI\u2019ll add you to the WhatsApp group,\u201d Philomene shouts back, handing the woman her phone so she can add her number.\n\n\u201cThe Collages Feminicide is not a small group. We are many,\u201d Philomene tells me as we walk. If the nerve centre is in Paris, where there are around 300 activists, the movement is spreading across the length and breadth of France, and includes cities such as Bordeaux, Lyon, Grenoble, and Lille. It is crossing borders too, with Belgium and Switzerland joining the effort.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It\u2019s not a niche movement, it\u2019s something that concerns everyone,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s a hive of activity. Hundreds of girls stick up names every night. The names are removed but the girls return and stick them up again. Honestly, almost every Parisian knows about us and our activities. We don\u2019t want to count dead women anymore.\u201d\n\nIf you go into the bourgeois and conventional areas such as the 16th or 17th arrondissement, you\u2019ll find trouble. People don\u2019t react well when you touch their Haussmannian building\n\nPhilomene joined the movement after seeing its Instagram and Twitter accounts. \u201cWhen I realised how many women were killed, I was shocked. I knew that I could help, that I could do something, so I joined,\u201d she says. And behind Philomene, an entire nation of women are up in arms. On 5 October, hundreds of women painted their skin with grey paint and walked towards the Montparnasse cemetery, representing each of the French femicide\u2019s victims. These activists were part of the French feminist movement, Femen, adding their voices so things will change.\n\n\u201cFemicide is a hate crime,\u201d one of the placards read. A Femen spokesperson pointed to the upsetting reality: \u201cBefore being killed, these women were victims of intra-familial violence and alerted the civil society, the police, the justice system, about the threats above their heads.\u201d\n\nAt the time of the Femen march earlier this month, 114 women had been killed. By 19 October, less than a month later, seven more women had died. To highlight those high numbers, #NousToutes, another charity, organised five \u201cdie-ins\u201d in Paris. Hundreds of women lay in the streets with the names of victims on their chests.\n\nIf these activists are working hard to make femicides a priority, it\u2019s because the government and prime minister Edouard Philippe\u2019s proposed reforms are not enough. \u201cIt\u2019s time to give back to French women the freedom to live and breathe. It\u2019s a huge emergency,\u201d he said when his government launched a multi-party debate on domestic violence on 3 September. The consultation brought together MPs and charity representatives to exchange ideas and create reforms to help improve the situation. there were calls for a \u201cMarshall plan\u201d, which would put reforms into practice immediately to prevent further victims.\n\n87,000 women killed intentionally each year globally\n\nSince that meeting, some actions have been taken, such as the wide-scale use of electronic bracelets, worn by domestic violence victims, which prevent the offenders from approaching victims and allows the wearer to contact the police with their bracelet.\n\nThis new technology is not the only prevention measure that has been put into place. Philippe also promised to create 250 housing centres for women in crisis and 750 spaces for temporary accommodation (for six months). These places will be available from January 2020. But is this really enough?\n\nIn parallel, the \u201cCatherine\u2019s fund\u201d, created by secretary of equality Marlene Schiappa, is slowly taking form with \u20ac1m in funding and the placement of 73 psychologists in police stations. Other reforms include the ability to press charges at the hospital or the loss of parental authority if one parent is violent. But these promises don\u2019t convince the population or organisations such as Collages Feminicide, which, Philomene says, \u201cwill glue and glue\u201d until they see \u201csome real changes\u201d.\n\nJeanne tells me that Collages Feminicide was started in response to the promises made by the government. \u201cAt the beginning, it was easier. There was a general headquarters in Denfert, in Paris. It had to close down and now we\u2019re organised by area; there are five of them.\u201d\n\nThe glueing movement hit the Paris streets for the first time on 30 August, with just 40 people. The aim was to pay tribute to each victim who died from her partner\u2019s punches. The design was always the same: name, date and circumstances of death such as \u201cstrangled\u201d, \u201cslaughtered\u201d, \u201cstabbed\u201d. The goal was also to raise awareness of the extreme violence to which some women are exposed to in their own home, and rally as many people together to support victims.\n\nBut across France and the rest of Europe, the protests are sometimes met with disdain. \u201cIf you go into the bourgeois and conventional areas such as the 16th or 17th arrondissement, you\u2019ll find trouble. People don\u2019t react well when you touch their Haussmannian building,\u201d Philomene explains\n\n\u201cOne day, a 60-year-old woman didn\u2019t agree with our message. We tried to explain to her what our mission was but it didn\u2019t work and she told us to leave. After that, she removed the slogan we had just glued. But at least we raised awareness of femicide in her mind,\u201d Jeanne adds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so exhausting. You spend all this time trying to make her change her mind and she just keeps saying, \u2018I don\u2019t have anyone who\u2019s been affected\u2019. Well, that\u2019s great for you,\u201d adds Philomene.\n\nIt\u2019s a hive of activity. Hundreds of girls stick up names every night. The names are removed but the girls return and stick them up again. Honestly, almost every Parisian knows about us and our activities. We don\u2019t want to count dead women anymore\n\nAccording to the activists, people react this way because they \u201cdon\u2019t like seeing the sad reality when they go to work in the morning\u201d. Besides denial, there\u2019s also an element of pure misogyny. \u201cOne guy said to us, \u2018What you\u2019re doing is ugly. Why are you doing that in our streets? How will people respect you if you don\u2019t respect others? And after that, they complain when they\u2019re given a slap.\u2019 To be honest, all that did was make us realise there was still a lot of work to do,\u201d says Jeanne.\n\n\u201cWith strong slogans like the ones we\u2019re sticking up tonight, we hope that some of them will pass by and see that they\u2019re not alone. That they\u2019re understood,\u201d Philomene explains. But for her, the other most important group to target is the aggressors. By seeing these slogans, they are forced to face their own violence, as well as the power of solidarity. It might make them realise the impact of their actions and ask for help, and perhaps it will even stop them being violent. As Margaret Atwood said in her essay Second Words: \u201cMen are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them.\u201d\n\nAround the world, almost 87,000 women are intentionally killed each year, according to a study by the UN. More than one in two of these victims are killed by a close relative or partner. As journalist Didier Fran\u00e7ois said on French radio network Europe 1: \u201c50,000 women are killed each year by a partner, a brother, a father or another close male relative each.\u201d\n\nThe numbers are daunting and show that femicide has become a global issue. According to the UN, the highest rate of femicide is in Africa. Eurostat, a directorate of the European Commission based in Luxembourg, ranks countries across Europe. Romania has the highest record of femicide cases, followed by Hungary, Finland, Latvia, Germany and France. In France today, femicide is a common word, even used by the prime minister. But in other parts of the world, it\u2019s struggled to penetrate the lexicon. Its plurality of definition has been much written about but its general and most common definition would be a hate crime perpetrated by men against women because of their gender.\n\nPhilomene isn\u2019t phased by this information. \u201cSome people don\u2019t know what femicide is. But, what we hope is that by seeing our collages they will become curious and type the word into Google. Just that action is a big step forward for us,\u201d she says with a warm smile on her face. Safe to say, we\u2019re all getting cold on this autumnal Paris evening, but that won\u2019t stop us, I\u2019m told.\n\nOf course, there are people who recognise the word and the issue for what it is: a disaster. \u201cCan I take a picture?\u201d shouts another 20-year-old woman on the street, who looks like she\u2019s on her way to a club. \u201cBy the way, it\u2019s incredible what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she adds, while putting the picture on her Instagram story. This support seems to cement the group\u2019s desire to do more and keep fighting for the rights of women dying at the hands of men not just in France, but all over the world. Crucially, Collages Feminicide knows that it is not alone in the fight.\n\nAs we move on to our next location, Jeanne tells me about a woman who came up to her during a previous night-tagging excursion. She reassured Jeanne that the work she was doing was important and would help many people. It turned out the woman belonged to a charity for female victims of domestic violence, to help them start over and gain confidence. \u201cWhen you hear that, you know that you\u2019re not useless and that what you are doing matters. It feels good,\u201d she says.\n\nWhile she has never had to endure domestic violence, Jeanne says some of the girls who work with Collages Feminicide have. \u201cWe meet and work with people who are in abusive relationships. I know that some of them are here for that, to free themselves from violence and pain but also to support each other,\u201d says Jeanne. \u201cThat is why we decided to translate some of our slogans in different languages, so every woman in the street can feel supported even if they are tourists,\u201d she adds.\n\nThe third member of the group, a pharmacist named Juliette, who has kept herself busy as we\u2019ve made our way around the city, suddenly spots a wall with good exposure. \u201cWe have to find a way to glue here,\u201d she shouts at us. \u201cNo, it\u2019s impossible, we would need a ladder and if the police come we\u2019re screwed,\u201d says Philomene.\n\nBut it seems Juliette has made up her mind: she takes a bin, rolls it near the wall and asks me to hold it. \u201cIf you help me, this will be the best one we\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK let\u2019s do it,\u201d we say. Two minutes later, Juliette resembles some kind of Marvel-esque superhero, as she stands strong on the bin \u2013 slogan glued on to the wall. \u201cStop femicides\u201d in huge unmissable letters. \u201cPeople tomorrow morning won\u2019t miss this \u2013 everyone will face our words, I think we\u2019ve done our duty for tonight,\u201d Philomene says. And like that, we slip off into the night\u2026 only glue and courageous slogans left to prove we were ever there.", "description": "Meet us in front of the station, we\u2019ll be making the glue,\u201d\u00a0is the text I receive from Jeanne, a student in Paris and a member of the feminist group Collages Feminicide.", "authors": ["Bertille Duthoit"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/29/15/femen-protest-france-2910191.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
