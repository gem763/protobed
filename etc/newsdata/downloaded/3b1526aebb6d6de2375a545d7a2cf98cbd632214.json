It\u2019s a perfect PR stunt to build on the already insane amount of buzz for the product. \u201cIt\u2019s so good we might owe you damages if we can\u2019t sell it to you.\u201d\n\nNext week some undercover PR flack will hold up a Popeyes at gunpoint and demand that he be provided with 50 chicken sandwiches immediately or he\u2019ll start executing one hostage every hour on the hour.\n\nSince we\u2019re on the subject of Popeyes and lawsuits, let this post serve as formal notice that I intend to sue everyone for fraud once I inevitably try this thing and it\u2019s 10 percent as good as it was cracked up to be.\n\nCraig Barr\u2019s suit accuses the company of false advertising, deceptive business practices and causing him to waste \u201ccountless time driving\u201d to and from local chains to find the sandwich. Barr, of East Ridge, also claims he was hustled out of $25 by a man who posted a Craigslist ad claiming he could get sandwiches a restaurant was hiding in the back, suffered rim and tire damage while driving from location to location, and was humiliated when his friends laughed at him. \u201cI can\u2019t get happy; I have this sandwich on my mind. I can\u2019t think straight,\u201d he told the Times Free Press on Thursday. \u201cIt just consumes you.\u201d\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s totally deceptive. Who runs out of chicken? It\u2019s a big fiasco. Someone has to stand up to big corporate,\u201d said an agitated Barr. \u201cEveryone is captivated by these sandwiches. They\u2019ve got everyone gassed up on them.\u201d\n\nGodspeed in your lonely fight against Big Chicken, Mr. Barr. Legal eagles, how much might he conceivably recover from Popeyes once news of his suit spreads and suddenly everyone is laughing at him, not just his friends?\n\nWhat makes the Popeyes chicken slop better than the other chicken slop out there? The Journal tried to explain in a new story about the \u201cchicken sandwich war\u201d that\u2019s erupted among Popeyes, KFC, Wendy\u2019s, and Chick-fil-A:\n\nChefs in its Miami test kitchen developed a new buttermilk batter. They tracked down special flour to create its crunchy texture, according to Popeyes. The same buttery topping used for biscuits was applied to its bun. The company had barrel-cured pickles cut thicker than those in many other chicken sandwiches, Popeyes said. Then they stirred an aggressive social-media campaign into the mix, tweeting back at posts from Chick-fil-A. The result was diners lining up for blocks at some Popeye\u2019s restaurants.\n\nThere\u2019s some sort of spicy spread on there too, I believe. Supposedly it took two years to perfect the recipe; while Popeyes was busy with that, KFC was busy working on, ah, meatless chicken, in case there\u2019s any doubt who\u2019s going to end up winning this war.\n\nThe hype, replete with videos on YouTube of people literally fighting over the sandwich in Popeyes chains, has reportedly been worth $65 million in media value to the company. Normally you don\u2019t see outsized buzz for a mediocre product on that scale outside of a new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie. Anyone who tried it before it sold out is welcome to try to convince me in the comments that it\u2019s worth waiting on line for. I won\u2019t believe you, but don\u2019t let that stop you from making the effort.\n\nHere\u2019s my favorite moment of the craze to date. What if the sandwich is the key to racial reconciliation in America?", "description": "\"I have this sandwich on my mind.
