He had promised he would leave his dog at a refuge before attempting the summit, said Peillex.\n\nInstead, he left in the middle of the night for the summit with the dog, which survived but returned with bloodied paws, according to photos posted on Peillex\u2019s Twitter account.\n\nThe incidents over the weekend came after two Swiss climbers landed a small plane east of Mont Blanc\u2019s summit in June and started hiking to the top.\n\nFrance to impose daily cap of 214 climbers on Mont Blanc Read more\n\nIntercepted by mountain police, they were handed a fine of \u20ac38 and allowed to fly off, since technically they had only broken 1960s\u2019 laws designating landing sites in the area.\n\n\u201cThis situation has gone on long enough,\u201d Peillex said. He called on Macron to \u201cwrite and pass laws without delay that from 2020 would severely punish all these wackos who break the law, and restore peace to Mont Blanc\u201d.\n\nOfficials are struggling to cope with a huge influx of climbers hoping to scale the 4,810-metre (15,774ft) peak, heightening the security risks as well as environmental impact.\n\nWarmer temperatures in recent years have melted the permafrost, raising the risk of rock falls on the most popular routes.\n\nRetreating glaciers, which are melting under the effect of global heating, are also leaving the granite slopes more vulnerable and prone to erosion.\n\nIn May, officials banned climbers from scaling Mont Blanc unless they had booked a room in one of the three official shelters.\n\nThe Alpine peak attracts nearly 25,000 climbers every year, but the daily crowds have led to flaring tempers among teams jockeying for position, and rampant illegal camping.\n\nSo far this season, at least three climbers have died on Mont Blanc.", "description": "Macron called on to legislate against \u2018wackos\u2019, including tourist who took dog to summit", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Grenoble"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abbf59eb399a86bd9a085d61d7972c33c02e3a86/0_104_750_450/master/750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5c5ce3497185d153eb8649d6f39d1dff"}
