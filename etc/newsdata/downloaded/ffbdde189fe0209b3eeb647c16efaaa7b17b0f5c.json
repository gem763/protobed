Having failed spectacularly to gain any traction with actual voters, Beto has been doing everything he can to stay relevant, from apologizing for his family\u2019s history as slave owners to cursing on live television and documenting and livestreaming his four-hour bus ride to Boston like some Vice News hipster reporting from an African war zone.\n\nAt least Beto can afford to buy a bigger boat when all this is over.", "description": "", "authors": ["Andrew Stiles", "Freebeacon.Com Blog Democrats-The-Worst"], "top_image": ""}
