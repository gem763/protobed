(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nHe has no one to blame but himself.\n\n\u2018I have news for everybody: Get over it.\u201d So saith acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy,\u201d he added.\n\nWell, if that\u2019s what he thinks, I have news for him. Get over it: Your boss is going to be impeached. And he has nobody but himself (and Rudy Giuliani) to blame for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s get as much throat clearing done as quickly as possible. Yes, the so-called Resistance has wanted Trump\u2019s 2016 victory annulled, canceled, made moot, or overturned. Yes, its members have injected a peculiar viral paranoia into our politics where everyone who disagrees with old foreign-policy grandees such as Richard Haas is now considered vaguely Ruskie. Yes, professional bureaucrats and members of the broader intelligence community have transgressed their duties in trying to contain or subvert the administration. Yes, Trump is surrounded by advisers and elected members of his own party who simply don\u2019t share his agenda of revising America\u2019s foreign and trade policies. Yes, recent presidents have also transgressed the Constitution on matters of foreign policy in ways I think ought to be impeachable, even if Congress doesn\u2019t. Yes, Ukraine under its previous government, more or less tried to interfere in the 2016 election and felt quite sheepish about it. And yes, I still believe the American policy of assistance to Ukraine is misguided. Trump could more or less survive all of that. Bad advisors and bad policy are normal.\n\nBut when Trump is impeached it will be Trump\u2019s own fault. I say \u201cwhen\u201d because the political logic for Democrats is becoming inescapable. Their base wants it to happen. And that\u2019s enough. All they needed was a reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Trump gave it to them. Having escaped the probe of Robert Mueller and the unbearably saccharine tweeting of James Comey, Trump almost immediately tossed his presidency out of the microwave-safe dish and into a dumpster fire. He did so by withholding congressionally authorized assistance to Ukraine and planning to withhold it until that country\u2019s leaders announced a politically expedient investigation into Trump\u2019s political rival\u2019s son, a plan that never came to fruition and has backfired spectacularly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd he did so without even the pretense that it was in America\u2019s national interest. At least, that is what we must conclude if we give any credit to William Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, whose Tuesday testimony before House impeachment investigators gives them a clear, easy-to-explain, and straightforward case that the president abused his power for electoral benefit. Abuse of power for personal electoral benefit is precisely the kind of \u201cmaladministration\u201d that some Framers \u2014 Madison excluded \u2014 had in mind when debating impeachment.\n\n\u201cHe said that President Trump wanted [Ukrainian] President [Volodymyr] Zelensky \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations,\u201d Taylor said. That and a bowl of chicken soup will, one morning soon, add up to a brisk impeachment and a healthy lunch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump brought this scandal on himself. Nothing compelled him to believe Rudy Giuliani\u2019s theories about Ukraine. His campaign or other surrogates could have dug up and shoveled dirt on Joe Biden and his son. There is plenty to go around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump arguably brought about the political conditions that have made his impeachment possible. He was unable or unwilling to pressure his party to vigorously pursue the most popular items he campaigned on in Congress. Instead they wasted his time with Obamacare repeal. (Another round of health-insurance-policy cancellations or alterations, it turns out, was electoral poison). He encouraged them to pass a politically unpopular tax cut. Mitch McConnell has done the lion\u2019s share of work on appointing judges. But when it comes to the unique \u201cTrumpian\u201d contribution to American governance, the only evidence of a Trump administration\u2019s existence is some executive orders related to the border crisis and a lot of tweets. It\u2019s not a surprise he lost Congress.\n\nNow, it is still exceedingly unlikely that 20 Republican senators will be inclined to join Democrats in conducting a full Senate trial and removing Trump from office. But the fact of impeachment, and the fact of Senate Republicans giving Trump their grudging deference, will likely inflame political passions going into election while vastly increasing public cynicism. Americans will be reminded that there is nothing \u2014 save for peaceful foreign policy and sound budgeting \u2014 that both parties can agree to reject as damnable and beyond the bounds of decency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps soon Trump will be the first president elected twice without carrying the popular vote. And the first president to be impeached twice.
