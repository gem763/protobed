Md. poll: Most Md. residents open to higher taxes to boost school spending", "language": "en", "text": "Maryland residents rank education and crime as the most important issues facing the state, with those living in the Baltimore area saying crime is a greater concern. The poll also shows deep concerns about the safety of vaping and support for significant environmental measures.\n\nAD\n\nThe poll results, released Thursday, offer the first public gauge of how much residents would accept in higher taxes to help offset the estimated $4 billion cost of a plan that aims to transform Maryland public schools to be among the best in the world.\n\nProposals include free preschool for all 4-year-olds, better career training for high school students, tougher teacher standards and more resources for students from low-income families. About 7 in 10 residents support a 22 percent boost to education spending, and the support extends to all geographic areas of the state and across party lines.\n\nAndrew McIver, a 46-year-old political independent from Pikes\u00adville, said he strongly believes that more funding for education is key to solving a number of other issues in Maryland, from improving employment rates to decreasing crime levels.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long-term approach that our politicians too often don\u2019t take,\u201d McIver said.\n\nState policymakers have yet to propose how to pay for the reforms, but a furious debate between Hogan and leading Democrats is already underway, with each side trying to build a case for whether the changes are necessary and whether the state can afford them.\n\nDemocrats pushing the changes say the state\u2019s education system is in crisis, and an overhaul is necessary to give every child equal access and ensure the next generation of Maryland\u2019s workforce can compete for jobs.\n\nHogan, who was elected twice on pocketbook issues, this week called the education recommendations a \u201cpie-in-the-sky\u201d proposal authored by officials who, he said, are \u201chellbent on spending billions more than we can afford.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe poll results show the governor is \u201cin for a fight on this one,\u201d said Michael Hanmer, a government and politics professor at the University of Maryland. \u201cI think the way he\u2019s been describing this suggests he knows that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Post-U. Md. poll finds 55 percent of state residents would be willing to see their income tax rate rise by a quarter of a percentage point, a hypothetical tax increase that amounts $200 for a family earning $80,000 a year. Such an increase would generate enough money to cover roughly one-sixth of the proposed spending increase.\n\nWhile most conservatives oppose that hypothetical tax hike, about a third of conservatives back it, as do most of the moderates (58 percent) and liberals (78 percent) who make up the vast majority of Maryland\u2019s electorate.\n\nMore than two-thirds of liberal residents would also support a bigger hypothetical increase, of half a percentage point. But overall, that rate increase is backed by a minority of residents \u2014 45 percent. It would generate roughly $400 in additional taxes for families earning $80,000 a year, enough money to cover about a third of the reforms. The size of the tax-rate increase appears to carry greater weight for political moderates, with support for the larger increase falling to 43 percent.\n\nSandy Harding, a retired educator, said improving public education is important to her and that \u201cthere is never enough funding.\u201d But Harding, a 67-year-old Republican, echoed Hogan\u2019s view that there needs to be more public accountability for the money Maryland already spends on public schools.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey keep raising taxes,\u201d Harding said. \u201cI really don\u2019t think that is the answer. I think we need to make sure we know where the money is going.\u201d\n\nState lawmakers are debating whether to legalize and tax recreational marijuana to help raise money for some education reforms. Roughly two-thirds of all residents support that idea, according to the poll, but it is a lot more popular among younger people. Over 8 in 10 \u2014 84 percent of adults 40 and younger \u2014 support legalizing marijuana to improve schools.\n\nWilliam Thomas, 40, a Democrat from Silver Spring, was in favor of increasing income taxes or legalizing and taxing marijuana to put more money toward public education. Thomas, who works in science policy, said he frequently talks with his wife, an elementary school teacher in Langley Park in Prince George\u2019s County, about her school, where there have been issues with mold and the aging building. He said conditions at the elementary school his children attend in Montgomery County, less than 15 minutes away, are markedly better.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe can see the contrast,\u201d he said. \u201cInvesting in education is really something I support.\u201d\n\nHogan has not taken a position on legalizing marijuana. But he has been raising money to finance a public-relations campaign against the education proposals, which were developed by a panel known as the Kirwan Commission (chaired by former University System of Maryland president William E. \u201cBrit\u201d Kirwan). Hogan calls the panel \u201cthe Kirwan Tax Hike Commission.\u201d\n\nThe poll finds that fewer than 2 in 10 residents have heard about Hogan\u2019s political groups raising unlimited contributions from undisclosed donors. But when asked, residents disapprove of Hogan doing so by a 2-to-1 margin, suggesting the activity could become a political liability for him.\n\nAD\n\nThe findings from the poll, conducted by The Post and the University of Maryland\u2019s Center for Democracy and Citizen Engagement, also suggest residents could be swayed by public advocacy about the Kirwan Commission\u2019s work. Six in 10 Marylanders say they have heard \u201cnothing at all\u201d about the undertaking.\n\nAD\n\nWhile residents in many parts of the state see public education as the biggest problem facing Maryland, a similar share rank crime as their biggest concern (20 percent and 22 percent, respectively). The heightened concern about crime is most pronounced in and around Baltimore City, which has been beset by a persistently high mrder rate and corruption scandals in the police department. It was the target of high-profile criticism by President Trump this summer.\n\nThe city is on pace for its fifth straight year of more than 300 homicides. Six years ago, Maryland residents ranked crime as the state\u2019s fourth-biggest problem, behind taxes, the economy and public education.\n\nAD\n\nIrene Gersh, a retiree who lives in Pikesville, said she used to enjoy going to the Baltimore Harbor and visiting the symphony and museums in the city. Now, she said, she avoids driving downtown.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is really not safe to drive,\u201d said Gersh, a political independent who ranked crime as her top issue. \u201cI live in a very safe suburb. But a couple of miles south, there are shootings every weekend.\u201d\n\nShe said she wants politicians to do more to address crime, including better supporting police and law enforcement officials, who she said have been \u201cdemonized since Freddie Gray, and it\u2019s only getting worse.\u201d\n\nOn the environment, the poll finds deep support for the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation ban on foam cups and food containers and a widespread willingness to embrace solar panel farms.\n\nNearly 8 in 10 residents support the ban, which took effect this summer. And 73 percent say they would be willing to live within a mile of a large solar farm. Separately, 52 percent say they would support requiring all new homes and other buildings to include rooftop solar panels, a more drastic measure to increase reliance on renewable energy . (Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich (D) this month proposed requiring solar panels on all newly built homes.)\n\nPatricia Lenehan, a Democrat and retired teacher in Towson, is part of the majority of Marylanders who support the foam ban and would support a rooftop solar panel requirement. She said such actions are necessary to combat global warming.\n\n\u201cWe all need to change our habits a bit,\u201d said Lenehan, 71, who added that she has noticed that the trees in her once-green neighborhood look less lush than they used to. \u201cI\u2019m standing here with my Starbucks cup, and I\u2019m a little bit ashamed.\u201d\n\nAmid a national outbreak of vaping-related illnesses, 86 percent of Maryland residents say they believe vaping is harmful to people\u2019s health, including almost 6 in 10 who say it is \u201cvery harmful.\u201d A third of residents say they have tried vaping. And 63 percent would support a proposed ban on the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, which federal regulators say have fueled the prevalence of e-cigarette use among young people.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis Washington Post-University of Maryland poll was conducted Oct. 9-14 among a random sample of 860 Maryland adults, 60 percent reached on cellphones and 40 percent on landlines. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points for the overall sample.\n\nScott Clement contributed to this report.", "description": "Gov.
