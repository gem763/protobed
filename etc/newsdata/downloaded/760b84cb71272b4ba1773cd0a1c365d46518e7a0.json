He forecast that oil prices would be 'lower for longer' and targeted BP's cost base.\n\n'And he began to slowly increase the company's reserves of oil and gas, which are now higher than they were when he took over. That combination helped BP to rebuild its dividend and help investors in their quest for income in a low-yield world.'\n\n'His successor, Bernard Looney, still has work to do. Total annual production of hydrocarbons in 2018 was lower than it was a decade earlier, net debt has crept up to nearly $47billion from $27billion and BP \u2013 as an oil firm \u2013 needs to show how it can fit in with Paris Agreement and the target of a carbon-neutral world by 2050, Mould continued. 'The company is already working on biofuels and wind and solar energy.'", "description": "The company's upstream business head Bernard Looney will succeed Dudley in the top job when he departs after the company's full-year results on 4 February.", "authors": ["Alex Sebastian For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
