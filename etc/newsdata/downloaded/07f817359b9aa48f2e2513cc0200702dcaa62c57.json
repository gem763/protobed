Sieber, 26, is facing one count of felony animal cruelty after a man named Vincent Minutello posted a video to of the woman abusing her dog. The video has received almost 3,000 comments since he posted it on Friday.\n\nSieber can be seen walking slowly towards her trailer in a parking lot with the dog on a leash before she swiftly kicks the animal in its rib cage. She then shortens the leash and pulls up on it so hard that the dog\u2019s front legs come up off the ground as it gasps for air.\n\nAs she begins walking again, the dog can be seen bracing itself before she pulls up even harder on the leash and choking the dog to the point where it can be seen gagging.\n\nMinutello, who filmed the incident from his car, then drives up to Sieber and asks her to stop treating her dog so poorly.\n\n\u201cHey, can you go a little easy on that dog, please,\u201d Minutello then says to Sieber from his car. \u201cYou can\u2019t do what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nSieber laughs and responds, \u201cPull on his collar?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are choking him. You are hanging your dog. He is sitting there by his neck and he can\u2019t breathe if you watch him,\u201d says Minutello in response to her question.\n\n\u201cYou can have him if you want him,\u201d Sieber then says in the video.\n\nAccording to an arrest report obtained by ABC\u2019s Tampa Bay affiliate station WFTS, Sieber told police that she was training the dog. Sieber is allegedly transient and lives in her trailer with two dogs.\n\nThe dog seen in the video, along with another dog that was not filmed, have been taken into custody by animal control and Sieber has been jailed in lieu of $5,000 bail as she awaits trial.\n\nMinutello has thanked the public for their assistance after he posted the video on Friday.\n\n\u201cThank you for all the support! For those who would have choose the violent route I understand your frustration. However documenting is key to a habitual offender,\u201d he says before imploring people not to resort to violence. \u201cPlease don\u2019t incriminate yourselves with violence. That is a short term reaction to what seems to be a long term problem. With this video hopefully we can put a stop to it.\u201d", "description": "A woman has been arrested and jailed after she was filmed kicking and choking her dog near her trailer in Pinellas County, Florida.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
