But is the world ready for modified mosquitoes and GM salmon? Read the feature\n\nA short stretch of bacterial DNA called a plasmid, used to deliver the hornless genetic variant to the parent bull, had been incorporated alongside one of the two hornless genetic variants.\n\nDr Van Eenennaam said the plasmid does no harm to the animals, but its inclusion technically makes the genome-edited bull a genetically-modified organism (GMO) in the traditional sense, because it contains foreign DNA from another species.\n\nThe researchers found no unintended genetic alterations in the calves.\n\nSince the original work to produce the hornless cattle, which was initiated by Minnesota-based biotech company Recombinetics, new methods have been developed that no longer use plasmids or any other foreign DNA sequence.\n\nSome scientists see the advent of genome editing as an opportunity to re-think the current US regulatory regime surrounding genetically modified animals.\n\nThe process for getting genetically modified food animals to market is regarded as costly and long by those involved in the field. So far, only one genetically modified animal has successfully navigated the regulatory approval process - the AquaAdvantage salmon.\n\nThese salmon incorporate a gene that allows the modified animals to grow all year round, rather than just during spring and summer. However, the process of regulatory approval by the Food and Drug Administration took more than a decade and cost millions of dollars.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter.", "description": "Researchers produce cattle that lack horns, meaning they cannot use them to injure other animals or humans.", "authors": ["Paul Rincon", "Science Editor", "Bbc News Website"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13300/production/_109129587_mediaitem109129586.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
