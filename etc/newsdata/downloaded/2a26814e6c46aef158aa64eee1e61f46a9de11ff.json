You have passed. This year, with all your efforts you have put in, you have gone up to 79.1%,\" she said.\n\nThe school also doubled its bachelors passes.\n\nPrincipal Khayalethu Boesman shared how happy and proud he was.\n\n\"To me, the results are about quality... we called you into the hall and spoke to you individually. [That] has worked and we thank you for responding positively to that,\" he said.\n\n\"Whatever we did last year didn't kill you,\" he said, eliciting giggles.\n\n'Came to learn'\n\nOne of the secrets to the school's success was the provision of extra classes.\n\nSchafer said: \"Mr Boesman has told me you had extra classes\u2026 but you also came to the extra classes, you didn\u2019t stay at home and watch TV or play on your phone. You came to learn. And that attitude in itself shows real commitment from you guys,\" she said.\n\n\"I want to say thank you to the parents because, without the parents being involved in their children\u2019s education, they will not succeed. You can\u2019t do it on your own. You don\u2019t even have to help them study, just being there and supporting them, encouraging them [helps].\"\n\n- See our Matric Results page.\n\nThere were lots of tears and hugs as pupils collected their results.\n\nBoesman reminded those who had failed that it was not the end of the road and that they should keep trying.\n\nThe Western Cape placed third behind Gauteng and the Free State with a pass rate of 81.5%, a decline from 84.4% in 2017.\n\nIt did however have the best retention rate, near 63%, of students who had been enrolled in Grade 10 in 2016 and progressed to write matric this year.\n\nThe next best retention rate was Gauteng at 49%.", "description": "The Cape Flats suburb of Delft has one of the highest rates of violent crime in the country, but matric pupils at one high school have risen above their circumstances to record an impressive 31.1% increase in their 2018 pass rate.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8267/b6a006ea8b3d4f508aa67e56c977eb89.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-01-04"}
