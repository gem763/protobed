He doesn\u2019t have to deal with people outside. He doesn\u2019t have to deal with his inadequacies as he sees them.\u2019\n\nMoffat was said to have health problems, anxiety, depression and disorders which \u2018perhaps should have been investigated a lot sooner\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMs Turner argued a prison sentence would leave him at risk of coming out homeless and without rehabilitation.\n\nBut Judge Stephen Ashurst jailed him for four years after hearing the \u2018extreme\u2019 case.\n\n\u2018For many years you\u2019ve lived a somewhat isolated and lonely life,\u2019 he told Moffat.\n\n\u2018But you\u2019ve chosen to take solace in seeking out and keeping this vast quantity of indecent images of children.\n\n\u2018The nature of the images describe, I\u2019m afraid, very extreme sexual activity.
