At the hearing in Stockport, a jury was shown damning CCTV footage which showed two stewards blocking the exit. They appeared to be watching the match and oblivious to Mr Whale's attempts to leave.\n\nAs a result, the pensioner was unable to reach the handrail at the side of the exit. The heartbreaking clip shows Mr Whale, forced to go through the middle of the pair, suddenly disappear.\n\nFollowing his fall he was taken to Salford Royal Hospital but died the next day surrounded by his family.\n\nAt the conclusion of the case, the coroner felt strongly enough to file the 'Report to Prevent Future Deaths' with a series of recommendations about changes the club needed to make. Though the cause of death was ruled as accidental and no blame was apportioned, three damning contributory factors were recorded:\n\n* Stewards impeding the exit.\n\n* Their obstruction of access to both handrails.\n\n* Their lack of awareness of their surroundings.\n\nAll three were listed on Mr Whale's death certificate.\n\nMr Whale sustained fatal head injuries while leaving the game against Manchester City\n\nUnited were also found not to have filed an accident report after the fatal fall.\n\nIn her subsequent report, coroner Alison Mutch OBE wrote: 'During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.'\n\nShe added that Trafford Council had issued a list of recommendations to United following Mr Whale's death, but stated: 'There was no mechanism in place for discussion of those recommendations or to ensure that they had been followed.'\n\nThe coroner stated that there was no evidence the stewards, who United accepted were not complying with the code of conduct, were regularly audited.\n\nPolice launched an investigation but found no evidence of criminal activity.\n\nMr Whale was leaving the match around 10 minutes before full-time when tragedy struck\n\nMr Whale, who played golf three times a week, had worked all over the world and was a much-loved family man, the court heard, and the impact of his death had been devastating.\n\nHis wife, June, was too upset to talk when contacted by Sportsmail at her home in Hale Barns, Cheshire.\n\nShe told the court she had asked her husband to wrap up warm for the game and was at home preparing his favourite dinner when she received a phone call telling her to go to the hospital.\n\nThe inquest, in November 2018, raised serious questions over fan safety at Old Trafford despite the vast sums one of the world's biggest clubs spends on players.\n\nA United spokesperson said: 'Everyone at Manchester United was deeply saddened by the death of Mr Whale and the club continues to extend its sincere condolences to his family.\n\n'The health and safety of all supporters and visitors at Old Trafford is of utmost importance to Manchester United and we go to great lengths to ensure procedures are monitored and adhered to at all times.\n\n'We work with independent safety inspectors from the local council, as well as national stadium safety inspectors, to ensure the correct procedures are administered.\n\n'We were fully compliant with all applicable regulations at the time of this tragic accident and the coroner's investigation resulted in a conclusion of accidental death.\n\n'However, we constantly seek to learn and improve on our procedures and we welcomed the observations in the coroner's report on opportunities for further risk reduction, which we have now implemented.'\n\nUnited would not tell Sportsmail what changes had been made.\n\nA spokesperson for Trafford Council said: 'Following the inquest into this tragic incident, the council worked with Manchester United to implement the recommendations of the coroner to ensure the safety of all fans and visitors to the stadium.'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE BY MIKE KEEGAN: Failings by Manchester United\ncontributed directly to the death of a lifelong fan at Old Trafford during a\nderby match in 2017.", "authors": ["Mike Keegan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/21/19461114-0-image-a-10_1570566787457.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
