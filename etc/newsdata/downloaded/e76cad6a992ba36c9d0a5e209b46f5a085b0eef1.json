Watching her portray Judy Garland in her new film, Judy, it\u2019s as though she dissolves, molecule by molecule, into the role. Directed by the renowned British stage director Rupert Goold and adapted from the Olivier and Tony-nominated play by Peter Quilter, Judy is set in 1969, when Garland, 46, broke, fraught, separated from her children, did a run of shows at the Talk of the Town nightclub in London. Garland is depicted drinking, pill-popping, impetuously getting married, hanging out with gay fans, sometimes wowing audiences, other times getting booed. There\u2019s Zellweger\u2019s physical transformation with contact lenses and prosthetics, but it\u2019s also in her insolent swagger over to the microphone when Garland is too drunk to perform. The slightly wild stare that begs you to look at her, but also implores you to look away. Zellweger even sings in character \u2013 live! A climactic hoarse rendition of Over the Rainbow is particularly poignant. With every gulp, twitch and shiver, Zellweger, starring alongside Michael Gambon, Jessie Buckley, and Rufus Sewell, makes it her business to be Judy Garland, and at times it\u2019s almost painful to watch.\n\nIt\u2019s a turn that has generated much awards buzz. Variety magazine said: \u201cZellweger offers an all-singing, all-dancing, all-collapsing performance of a star at her lowest physical and psychological ebb.\u201d At the recent Toronto international film festival, there was such an extended and rapturous standing ovation \u2013 one journalist later tweeting that she\u2019d seen nothing like it in 15 years of attending the festival \u2013 that Zellweger eventually had to tell the audience to \u201cquit it\u201d, because her tears were \u201cmessing up\u201d her makeup. While we Brits are hyper-aware of Zellweger from the Bridget Jones films, of course her resum\u00e9 is far more varied than that, from her Girl Friday murmuring \u201cYou had me at hello\u201d in Jerry Maguire (1996), to Roxie in Chicago (2002), where she proved she could sing and dance, to her spirited farm hand in Cold Mountain (2003), for which she won an Oscar, and, more recently, in What/If on Netflix \u2013 where she camped it up as predatory Anne Montgomery (think Barbara Stanwyck via Cruella de Vil). Now, with Judy, Zellweger offers a study in wrecked humanity \u2013 it wasn\u2019t long after this film was set that Garland was found dead in her rented mews house in Belgravia following an accidental overdose of barbiturates.\n\nI\u2019m waiting in the London hotel suite where we\u2019re scheduled to meet when Zellweger pops her head around a corner to chirp \u201cHello!\u201d She\u2019s wearing a fawn-coloured outfit and pointy red shoes (her own ruby slippers?), with her hair partly pulled back. When I tell her that she looks chic, she says: \u201cOh thanks very much. It\u2019s only by mistake that I look like this today.\u201d There are some \u201cHollywood trappings\u201d (a PA type hovers in the background), but there\u2019s no starriness about Zellweger \u2013 she just plonks down on the sofa, tucking her feet beneath herself. If she is guarded about some questions, it\u2019s understandable. There are some tough subjects: the claim that Harvey Weinstein used her name to sexually pressure other actresses; the world erupting over her \u201cchanged\u201d appearance at the Elle Woman in Hollywood awards in 2014. Otherwise, Zellweger is softly spoken, smart, reflective, and brimming with the down-to-earth Texas charm of her upbringing. When I observe that playing Garland is one thing, but singing as her must be a whole new level of horror (perhaps I could have phrased this more delicately), she starts giggling at the word \u201chorror\u201d. \u201cThat was really well put\u2026 No, no, don\u2019t take it back \u2013 you\u2019re 100% right!\u201d\n\nAsked about the differences between playing Roxie and Garland, Zellweger ticks off a list. \u201cLive performance. Live audience. Real person. Person that I care about. Person who\u2019s meant a lot to me and millions, through generations.\u201d Judy is also about the cruelty of the old Hollywood studio system \u2013 with scenes showing the young Judy (Darci Shaw) being controlled, nagged about her weight, and started on a regime of uppers and downers that would ruin her for life. Zellweger says that thankfully there are stricter child labour laws these days. As to whether modern female performers are better off generally, she\u2019s uncertain: \u201cBecause you see the Amy Winehouse documentary\u2026\u201d\n\nGarland\u2019s daughter, Liza Minnelli, criticised Judy \u2013 posting on her Facebook page that she wasn\u2019t sanctioning the film, and had never met nor spoken to Zellweger, writing: \u201cAny reports to the contrary are 100% fiction.\u201d Does Zellweger think that was because Minnelli hadn\u2019t seen Judy, and would find any film about her mother difficult? There\u2019s a pause while Zellweger considers the question. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she says eventually. \u201cI wish she was here so we could chat!\u201d Speaking to her, it\u2019s clear that Zellweger took pains to avoid producing an \u201cimpersonation\u201d or a caricature of Garland. \u201cShe\u2019s such a legend. But there\u2019s so much to the human being as well. You want her to come across as big as she was, but also show the woman\u2026 Her intelligence, determination, tenacity, hope. She never gave that up, no matter the circumstances.\u201d\n\nZellweger, 50, grew up in Katy, Texas, and studied at the University of Texas in Austin. \u201cI consider Austin home, and I have a lot of extended family there, so I get back a lot,\u201d she says. From early childhood, she wanted to be a writer. \u201cWhen the Easter bunny was coming, I would always wish for the same thing \u2013 I loved a tablet of fresh ruled paper and sharp pencils. There\u2019s nothing better \u2013 stories, poetry, the possibilities were endless.\u201d Her mother was Norwegian, and her father Swiss, which made her feel different. \u201cI very much feel my Texan roots, but there\u2019s no denying that I\u2019m a child of European people.\u201d While at university, she \u201cfell\u201d into acting roles. \u201cRather than continue on to get my journalism degree, I finished up quickly with my lit degree, just to see where [acting] would go,\u201d she says. \u201cI figured I could always go back and get a master\u2019s, and finally submit to the Daily Texan!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Renee Zellweger as Judy Garland in Judy. Photograph: David Hindley/Allstar/BBC Films\n\nThere seems a certain piquancy to Zellweger aiming to become a journalist when she must have often felt like media prey. Then again, Zellweger tells me that she usually has no problems wandering around incognito. She famously stepped back from screen-acting for six years in 2010, and thinks that helps her in the street. \u201cTaking that time away, when you\u2019re not in people\u2019s consciousness, they think: \u2018Oh yeah, she looks like somebody, maybe, but, um, who? I don\u2019t know\u2026\u2019\u201d Zellweger gives her distinctive throaty chuckle: \u201cI sneak around really, really well.\u201d She\u2019s also good at being private, despite high profile relationships, including Jim Carrey, Jack White, a short marriage to Kenny Chesney, Bradley Cooper and, latterly, musician Doyle Bramhall II (just before I meet her, there are rumours that they\u2019d split). Is she in a relationship? Zellweger laughs airily: \u201cI\u2019m in a million relationships!\u201d She says she doesn\u2019t find it difficult to have a personal life: \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult at all. You just don\u2019t talk about it, you don\u2019t post it\u2026 I know it\u2019s so boring when you\u2019re trying to talk to an actress and she\u2019s being all cryptic and whatever. But I like to keep it\u2026\u201d \u2013 she mimes a zipping action \u2013 \u201cI just do.\u201d It\u2019s also about work: \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to be an actor who disappears when you have no mystery.\u201d It\u2019s a distraction when there\u2019s too much of a public persona? \u201cYeah, I think a little mystery never hurt a girl.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d been wondering whether it\u2019s partly about how roles such as Bridget Jones utilise Zellweger\u2019s everywoman quality (warmth, approachability) \u2013 when people feel they know someone, maybe there\u2019s also an element of feeling they own them? Whatever\u2019s going on, Zellweger says it doesn\u2019t \u201cexist\u201d for her, because she doesn\u2019t read, watch, or in any way seek out what people are saying about her. She just ignores it? \u201cYeah, because there\u2019s no upside to not ignoring it. I wouldn\u2019t learn anything from it. It wouldn\u2019t be helpful. What would I do? Explain myself? Or try to somehow mitigate a rumour that someone has started? It seems like a lot of wasted energy to me. I could just be with my dogs, or FaceTime my nephew, or work on writing something. That\u2019s a lot of energy that you would just sort of haemorrhage. All day. On things that you can\u2019t control anyway. And why would you want to?\u201d\n\nOne thing Zellweger did respond to was the Elle Woman in Hollywood awards furore, which could only be described as a global pile-on \u2013 for a while, it seemed like the entire world was accusing her of having plastic surgery. As it happens, the day I meet her, Zellweger looks exactly like herself, but that\u2019s not the point \u2013 even if those 2014 photos did look unlike her, it doesn\u2019t justify what she endured. Zellweger ended up penning an article for the Huffington Post, titled \u201cWe can do better\u201d. She wrote: \u201cNot that it\u2019s anyone\u2019s business, but I did not make a decision to alter my face and have surgery on my eyes\u201d \u2013 but the article was about much more than that, debating everything from intrusion to women\u2019s worth. To make sure I\u2019m not putting words into her mouth, I double-check with Zellweger that she wrote it (she did). It\u2019s not only an impressive, erudite read (the inner writer is on full beam), it\u2019s also brave. \u201cIt just felt necessary,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2013 was it really brave \u2013 if there\u2019s no consequence?\u201d She didn\u2019t know that when she wrote it. \u201cYeah, I did, I did,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing that\u2019s going to happen? What else could be said? How else could I have been made fun of? Or whatever happened\u2026 I know what that felt like, and I survived it, so what else?\u201d\n\nZellweger was also dragged into #MeToo. As part of the ongoing class-action lawsuit, actor Melissa Sagemiller claimed that Harvey Weinstein told her that Zellweger and Charlize Theron had given \u201csexual favours\u201d for roles. There was a robust response from the Zellweger camp: \u201cIf Harvey said that, he\u2019s full of shit.\u201d (Though Zellweger says she didn\u2019t personally put out a statement about it.) Regarding what Weinstein is alleged to have said about her, Zellweger says: \u201cI did hear about that, yes.\u201d Generally speaking, did Zellweger have any bad experiences in the industry? \u201cNever directly in that way. But, you know, there were certain behaviours that I would tolerate because I had a job to do, and I was more interested in getting through the day than in correcting someone, certainly. They weren\u2019t offences of the variety that you\u2019re referencing. But there were certain languages and liberties that certain people would take. But they would take them from anyone, in my estimation, not just me as a woman. But I\u2019m sure there were countless instances that I was not aware of \u2013 in terms of deals that were made and conversations that were had, that were derogatory, that I was not privy to. Sure. Of course. I\u2019d be naive to think that I was immune.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zellweger with Colin Firth and Patrick Dempsey in Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby. Photograph: Giles Keyte/AP\n\nZellweger identifies as a feminist, and admires the women who came forward: \u201cIt gives you strength in numbers, doesn\u2019t it? It enables you to, in some way, begin to heal.\u201d She seems cautiously optimistic about changes in Hollywood: \u201cI think it\u2019s also right at this very delicate moment where there\u2019s fear and so everybody is hyper-aware of the decisions that they make and what they say\u2026 It will be really interesting to see where it settles. But change is inevitable because there\u2019s this new generation of women who are coming of age, and producing things, in every industry, not just Hollywood. They\u2019re not waiting for permission because they don\u2019t need to \u2013 and it never occurred to them that they needed to.\u201d\n\nConsidering the relentless nature of Hollywood, Zellweger\u2019s six-year career break was a gamble. Was it a work-sabbatical, a fame-sabbatical, or a combination of both? \u201cI needed to take care of myself,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was more about being bored with myself, bored with my performances, and drawing on the same experiences, it just felt like regurgitated life, and I needed to collect some life experiences because the well was a bit dry. And I hadn\u2019t grown in any way for years\u2026 It\u2019s just redundancy. Because while the experiences were once-in-a-lifetime, dream-come-true blessings, there\u2019s not really room for anything else. And I needed to learn something else. I needed to grow as a person. To grow up a little bit. And I needed to physically take care of myself\u2026 But I didn\u2019t stop working, I still worked, just in a different capacity. I can\u2019t be idle.\u201d She has a work ethic? \u201cOh yes!\u201d\n\nThe interview is winding to a close. Does Zellweger have any reaction to the US political climate? \u201cEvery day!\u201d Around the time we meet, President Trump has told four congresswomen to \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they originally came from (three of the four women were in fact born in America). Does this kind of thing concern her? \u201cEvery day,\u201d repeats Zellweger. \u201cOf course\u2026 It\u2019s very upsetting. And it\u2019s upsetting that it\u2019s not as upsetting to as many folks as it should be.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zellweger as Judy Garland. Photograph: David Hindley/Allstar/BBC Films\n\nZellweger isn\u2019t able to confirm her forthcoming projects, not even if there\u2019s definitely going to be another Bridget Jones film: \u201cI\u2019m not being coy, I promise. I\u2019m always the last to know\u2026 I do know that Helen [Fielding] has written a book, so maybe.\u201d\n\nZellweger once spoke about suffering from impostor syndrome \u2013 could that just be a human thing? \u201cYeah, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a human thing. For most people\u2026 There are brain surgeons and whatnot who have to have a different kind of certitude about their skill.\u201d Might it affect women more? \u201cThat we don\u2019t feel entitled to whatever it is that we\u2019ve worked for? That\u2019s possibly true.\u201d Stage fright ate Garland alive, and Zellweger tells me that she suffers from that too. Is that the negative side of creativity, the darkness of it? \u201cThe self-doubt? I suppose so. But it\u2019s also a complicated mix of things when there\u2019s an audience involved, when there\u2019s\u2026\u201d \u2013she adopts a melodramatic voice \u2013 \u201cpublic humiliation looming.\u201d She corrects herself, with an arch smile. \u201cPotential public humiliation looming.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cYou know, you just want to protect yourself.\u201d\n\nZellweger has the impostor syndrome under control now: \u201cNot so much that I\u2019d ever take anything for granted \u2013 that I\u2019d ever sleep while I was doing something, lest I miss something,\u201d she says wryly. \u201cBut it manifests a bit differently now. I can shut \u2018her\u2019 up a little more quickly.\u201d Zellweger has won Oscars, Golden Globes, Baftas and more \u2013 it must get to the point of \u201cHey, I can do this!\u201d Zellweger smiles, shifts in her seat. \u201cI don\u2019t really look it that way, I don\u2019t judge it\u2026 I just look at it as \u2013 that was that moment, and now this is this moment\u2026 It\u2019s kind of like education, I suppose \u2013 it stays with you. It doesn\u2019t mean you should stop learning.\u201d\n\nJudy is in UK cinemas from 2 October", "description": "The actor is generating awards buzz for her performance as Judy Garland.
