It's not good for the soul.\n\nNow what?\n\n\u2014 Your Honor\n\nYour Honor: Now, give your soul a checklist.\n\n\u25cfForgive vs. judge anything you yourself have done.\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/for The Washington Post)\n\n\u25cfForgive anything you\u2019ve forgiven in someone you love.\n\n\u25cfForgive anything that could have even one reasonable or sympathetic explanation \u2014 though thinking up as many as possible is a great exercise in compassion.\n\nSay you\u2019ve judged a stranger for snapping at his kids. But maybe he\u2019s just been dumped/fired/scarily diagnosed. Forgivable, right? So forgive.\n\nYou judge someone\u2019s cart full of junk food? Maybe her parents harped on food and weight for her entire childhood and this is her fight song. Forgiveness granted, sister.\n\nYou judge jerks for cutting you off? Maybe they didn\u2019t see you. Let\u2019s hear it, you imperfect driver: Gimme an F!\n\nForgiveness draws in; contempt pushes away.\n\nIf your soul wants details, then it can search \u201cfundamental attribution error.\u201d This knowledge might not eradicate your judginess completely; mental reflexes are what they are, plus some things need our scorn so we\u2019re motivated to change them. However, it can put that judgy little voice in its place. I suspect your soul will approve.\n\nDear Carolyn: I've been married five years. We were together 13 years before that. We have two children under 5 and have been separated one year.\n\nOur marriage was awful. He started a new business and had absolutely no time for me or the kids. He also resented that one of my younger siblings lived with us and said that was one reason he didn't want to be home. He was neglectful, unsupportive and became so distant. I threatened to leave, and he'd laugh.\n\nEventually, I discovered he had an online dating profile. He swore he never met anyone and was just seeking attention as we became strangers.\n\nI moved back home with my family.\n\nHowever, everyone \u2014 my family and his \u2014 has pushed me to try again for the kids. They said I'll regret it if I don't give the marriage one more chance, since he is apparently changed and sorry and he wants to be better. His business is more on track, and he has more time.\n\nMy heart says it's not worth it. I was so unhappy. But my mind says try again because of the kids and because our relationship prior to marriage was good.\n\n\u2014 So Confused\n\nSo Confused: Don\u2019t let anyone tell you what to think, do, feel, try or regret.\n\nObservations are valuable; preconceived notions are not.\n\nYou\u2019re the one who lived in this marriage. You know your husband \u2014 and yourself when you\u2019re with your husband. You (will) know if his change is sincere, relevant, enough.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to try again, then don\u2019t.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure, then stay put until you are sure, one way or another.\n\nIn the meantime, regardless, live your life in a way that feels right for now, restorative-healthy-certain for now and as likely as possible to be productive later.\n\nHas it not occurred to these families how tough it would be \u201cfor the kids\u201d if your second chance were unsuccessful?
