Ilhan Omar (MN) \u201can absentee landlord\u201d in her state because residents are unhappy with her.\n\nChris Kelley told Fox & Friends: First on Thursday that Minnesotans, including those in the Somali community, have not been happy with the job she has been doing representing her state since her election in 2018.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s traveling the world. She\u2019s fighting the president on Twitter. She\u2019s not doing anything in the district. And, I can say firsthand, the homelessness, the opioid problems, and other issues aren\u2019t improving,\u201d said Kelley, who announced an independent run for Omar\u2019s seat this year.\n\nKelley, who is also an Iraq war veteran, added that although Democrats say Omar won in a landslide, only 37 percent of the population turned out to vote.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a lot of people coming out, and I think we have an excellent chance of coming out on top,\u201d he told Fox & Friends: First.\n\nOmar\u2019s candidacy has been put front and center as President Donald Trump prepares to hold a 2020 campaign at Minneapolis\u2019s Target Field\u2014 which is located within Omar\u2019s district.\n\nFar-left protesters with Antifa have already announced a counter-rally called America is Canceled, to protest \u201cthe nightmare that is Trump.\u201d\n\nMinnesota Public Radio reported that thousands of counter-protesters are expected to show up.\n\n\u201cIt is frustrating,\u201d Kelley said of the counter-rally. \u201cWe should welcome any sitting president coming here. We\u2019ve welcomed other presidents with open arms and now because there\u2019s a disagreement or we have a president across a different aisle, there\u2019s an issue here. So, I believe we should disagree with dignity.\u201d", "description": "A Minneapolis police officer and congressional candidate called freshman Rep.
