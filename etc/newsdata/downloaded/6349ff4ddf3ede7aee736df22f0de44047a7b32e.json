An elected government could not be ended on someone\u2019s desire, he added.\n\n\u201cWho dares to end the present government having complete confidence of the nationals on Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). There are government and opposition in a democracy. Opposition launches criticism against the government even it offers namaz [prayers]. The government will be perfect until people think it is good.\u201d\n\nThe interior minister was of the view that a task performed at the wrong moment will fail to give any impact as compare to the wrong step taken on the right time.\n\n\u201cOur cabinet meeting convened on every Tuesday just like we offered the Friday prayers. Prime Minister has always questioned his ministers for the progress of serving human beings but not just delivering a speech before the commencement of the meeting.\u201d\n\nZulfi Bukhari also interacted with the media persons after inaugurating a \u2018Sahulat Counter\u2019 for overseas Pakistanis at police facilitation centre in Islamabad. He said that the facilitation centres will also be established in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Punjab which will provide assistance to the overseas Pakistanis besides resolving issues of the people living in rural areas.\n\nBukhari said that the nationals living abroad are facing land grabbing issues while the facilitation centre will help them resolving land disputes within one month.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Interior Minister Ijaz Ahmed Shah said he thinks that JUI-F supremo Maulana Fazlur Rehman will not reach the federal capital Islamabad on October 27.", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ijaz-Shah-statement-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
