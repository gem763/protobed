We\u2019ll see during the week if I can try something different, try something new.\n\n\"I will definitely tell you it won\u2019t be a kick \u2013 as I\u2019m not allowed to kick. That will be out of the question.\"\n\nAll jokes aside, Vermeulen knows that the Welsh will be an incredibly side to beat in Yokohama on Sunday.\n\n\"They are a difficult team to beat, to play against. They are not Grand Slam champions for nothing. They have been world No 1 this year \u2013 in and out, first and second position,\" he said.\n\n\"They\u2019re a top-class team with top-class players. We will really need to make a massive step up.\n\n\"It\u2019s not a team you can\u2019t score against, but you have to be clinical in what you want to do and how you want to approach that.\"\n\nThe Boks may have lost their last four fixtures against Wales, but when it comes to World Cups there is no doubt, they have more pedigree having won the tournament twice and having appeared in four previous semi-finals.\n\nWales, meanwhile, are two-time semi-finalists having been eliminated at that stage on 1987 and 2011.\n\nBut does that mean anything?\n\n\"It\u2019s actually a difficult thing,\" Vermeulen offered.\n\n\"In a way, it does. But in a different way, it\u2019s got no relevance. When you get to these stages, it\u2019s knockouts \u2013 so, do or die.\n\n\"But if you\u2019ve been in pressure situations before, you kind of know how to handle that, how to soak it all in, and how to turn that pressure into something positive.\n\n\"We\u2019ve got guys in our team who can do that. Wales have guys in their team who can do that too, who can handle the pressure and turn it around into something positive.\n\n\"But you\u2019ve got to win. That\u2019s the main thing.\"\n\nKick-off on Sunday is at 11:00 (SA time).\n\n- Compiled by Lloyd Burnard", "description": "Springbok No 8 Duane Vermeulen provided a moment of brilliance to knock Wales out of the Rugby World Cup in 2015.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9480/d1a5a43be4984b67a422fb8e8ad30e2d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
