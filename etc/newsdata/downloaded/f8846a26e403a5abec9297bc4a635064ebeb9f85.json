Oliver Ekman-Larsson finished with two assists.\n\nDarcy Kuemper made 38 saves for the Coyotes. He has allowed two goals or less in 11 straight games, tying the franchise record set by Nikolai Khabibulin.\n\nMark Scheifele had a goal and an assist and extended his point streak to five games with his team-leading fourth goal of the season for Winnipeg.\n\nKyle Connor also scored for Winnipeg, and Josh Morrissey had a pair of assists.\n\nConnor Hellebuyck stopped 31 shots for the Jets, who were playing the second game of a five-game homestand and coming off a 7-2 loss to Pittsburgh.\n\nThe teams were tied 1-1 after the first period, but Arizona scored a pair of power-play goals and led 4-1 following the second.\n\nWith Coyotes forward Derek Stepan off for hooking, Patrik Laine blasted a shot that hit the post and Scheifele sent the rebound past Kuemper at 7:35 of the first.\n\nGarland deflected a shot from the point by Ekman-Larrson with eight seconds remaining in the opening period to tie it.\n\nDvorak and Schmaltz scored with the man advantage just over two minutes apart in the second to stretch Arizona\u2019s lead to 3-1 at 7:21.\n\nJets defenseman Josh Morrissey had accidentally flipped the puck into his own net after Dvorak touched it.\n\nSchmaltz then scored through traffic and Dvorak added his second goal of the game when he beat Hellebuyck on the glove side at 17:47.\n\nWith Garland in the penalty box for a high-sticking double minor against Laine, Connor flipped a backhand shot by Kuemper at 4:48 of the third to make it 4-2.\n\nWinnipeg had another power play with five minutes left in the third, but failed to convert.\n\nNOTES: Arizona converted both its power-play chances. The Jets were 2 for 6.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCoyotes: Host Nashville on Thursday.\n\nJets: Host the New York Islanders on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Christian Dvorak scored a pair of goals and the Arizona Coyotes beat the Winnipeg Jets 4-2 on Tuesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/coyotes_jets_hockey_03323_c0-162-3900-2437_s1200x700.jpg?c1f1f770fef2fba48b8e857ce4d05e8d5142cf2d", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
