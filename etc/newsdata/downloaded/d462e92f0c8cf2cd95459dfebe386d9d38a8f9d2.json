Paul Pogba, Luke Shaw, Nemanja Matic, Axel Tuanzebe and Diogo Dalot are all out while David De Gea did not travel.\n\nJesse Lingard could return from injury, but youngsters Mason Greenwood and Brandon Williams are likely to get chances to impress. Under-23 full-back Ethan Laird is also part of the squad.\n\nPartizan are unbeaten in their last 11 home games in this competition and United will face a hostile atmosphere.\n\nAsked about United's dodgy away for, Solskjaer said: \"It\u2019s a question we\u2019ve asked ourselves as well, after I came in we won nine on the bounce and since then we haven\u2019t won any it\u2019s an issue we have to deal with, sort out as soon as possible, we\u2019ve got four games away on the trot and hopefully those statistics will turn.\"", "description": "Manchester United face Partizan Belgrade for the first time in European competition since the 1965-66 season, and the fixture will always have a special resonance for the club.", "authors": ["Daniel Zeqiri", "Alan Tyers", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/24/TELEMMGLPICT000214007141-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqheKI8zghe9k8vO-PcThF58ST1pw54668G6RHKN1h9fc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
