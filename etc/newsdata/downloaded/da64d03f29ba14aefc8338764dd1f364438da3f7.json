Some are very smart, aggressive and some are silly with it.\n\n\u201cThrough those experiences of racing with people, you give some more space. And others you don\u2019t have to, they\u2019re quite respectful.\n\n\u201cBut yeah, Max. It\u2019s very likely you\u2019re going to come together with Max if you don\u2019t give him extra space. So most of the time you do.\u201d\n\nHamilton said in this instance he did not have any extra space to give but added that he did not think the collision was intentional.\n\nBottas said Verstappen, who has won two races this season and is famed for his bold and aggressive overtaking manouevres, had appeared seemingly out of nowhere and they touched.\n\n\u201cHe got a puncture from that. I couldn\u2019t really avoid him. I think he earned his own puncture definitely,\u201d added the Finn.\n\nVerstappen had qualified on pole position on Saturday but was then handed a three place grid penalty for failing to slow after Bottas crashed at the end of the session and brought out warning flags.\n\nThe 22-year-old had won the last two Mexican Grands Prix and arrived as a favourite for a hat-trick in front of a sellout crowd.\n\nFerrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel, who finished second, was asked whether he treated Verstappen \u2014 a driver he has also clashed with a few times in the past \u2014 differently and whether he also thought him the most aggressive.\n\n\u201cYes and yes,\u201d replied the smiling four times world champion, sitting alongside Hamilton in the post-race news conference and making clear that he agreed with everything the Briton had said.\n\n\u201cJust copy and paste. It\u2019s true.\u201d", "description": "Max Verstappen has to be given more space on the racetrack than other drivers because of the risk of collisions, Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton said after the pair banged wheels in Sunday's Mexican Grand Prix.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445785289&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0K3-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
