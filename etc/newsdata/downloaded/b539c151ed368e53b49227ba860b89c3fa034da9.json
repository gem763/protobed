The average sales price dropped 12 percent, to $1.64 million.\n\nCondo sales fell 8 percent, logging 946 transactions. Co-op sales, on the other hand, were up a modest 2 percent year over year.\n\n\u201cThe third quarter of 2019 was undoubtedly the most challenging quarter in recent memory, especially for condo sales,\u201d Garrett Derderian, managing director of market analysis at CORE, said in a statement. \u201cMarket prices have gone from what was once described as the kindest, gentlest correction to a near free fall. The last time conditions were described in such a way was in the height of the recession.\u201d\n\nOnly 9.7 percent of sales were above $3 million, down 14.8 percent from last year. The last time sales above $3 million were that low was in 2012.\n\nConsequently, nearly 30 percent of inventory on the market was priced above $3 million.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that many buyers rushed to purchase properties before an increase in the city\u2019s mansion tax and transfer tax took effect in July.\n\n\u201cThird quarter data reflects a more accurate snapshot of the current market \u2013 continued price correction,\u201d Diane M.

The tax rates vary from 1.25 percent for $2 million sales, to 3.9 percent for sales of $25 million and higher. The city also increased a one-time charge on properties worth more than $2 million \u2013 known as the transfer tax. That fee, typically paid by a seller, varies from 0.4 percent for transactions under $3 million, to 0.65 percent for anything above $3 million.\n\nAs previously reported by FOX Business, more than 25 percent of new condos that have been built in New York City since 2013 remain unsold. In terms of units \u2013 of the 16,242 condos built since 2013, about 12,133 have sold. That means more than 4,100 have not.\n\nExperts have said the trend could be indicative of a potential future recession.\n\nFalling real estate prices come as concerns mount over the new tax law\u2019s impact on high-tax states \u2013 particularly a $10,000 cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions. Some people have begun fleeing states like New York and New Jersey, headed for lower-tax areas like Florida and Texas.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nNew York was one of a handful of states dealt a blow in its bid to challenge the SALT cap this week, after a judge dismissed its lawsuit.", "description": "High-end sales plummeted in the third quarter, following an increase in the mansion tax.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/bank-of-america-tower-001Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
