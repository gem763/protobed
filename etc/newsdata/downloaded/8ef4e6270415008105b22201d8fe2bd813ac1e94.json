Anyone trying to cross in either direction was affected.\u201d\n\nHe did not give further details on the deal reached with the migrants.\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection said cross-border traffic \u201cwas temporarily halted at about 1:30 am after a group of 250 to 300 migrants without entry documents\u2026 gathered at the midpoint of the Gateway Bridge.\u201d\n\nThe United States has dramatically restricted access for migrants seeking to request asylum, most of whom President Donald Trump\u2019s administration says are \u201ceconomic refugees,\u201d rather than people actually fleeing for their lives.\n\nTrump has pushed Mexico to crack down on the surging number of Central Americans crossing its territory toward the United States.\n\nIn June, he threatened to impose steep tariffs on Mexican goods if President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s government did not do more to stop irregular migration.\n\nAnxious to avoid a trade war with its giant northern neighbor, the destination for 80 percent of its exports, Mexico agreed to a massive policy shift.\n\nIt has deployed 21,000 National Guardsmen to reinforce its borders and accepted the return of more than 50,000 asylum seekers, who must now wait in Mexico while their claims are processed.\n\nMexico\u2019s immigration authority said the migrants in Matamoros have all been given legal residence and Mexican identity documents, enabling them to stay on the Mexican side.\n\n\u201cThey can integrate here. There are many foreigners who are working and we are inviting them to stay,\u201d said Segismundo Martinez, the immigration authority\u2019s representative in Matamoros.", "description": "Ciudad Victoria (Mexico) (AFP) \u2013 Hundreds of Central American migrants blocked a border crossing Thursday between the Mexican city of Matamoros and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/372cc2_us-has-dramatically-restricted-access-migrants-seeking-request-asylum-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
