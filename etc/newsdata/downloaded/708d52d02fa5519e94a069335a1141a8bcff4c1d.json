The idea of holding the event at Trump's resort has been criticised by government ethics watchdogs.\n\nTrump has touted his resort, saying it is close to the airport, has plenty of hotel rooms and offers separate buildings for every delegation.\n\nA team looking at the sites reported that it was \"the perfect physical location to do this\", acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said. He said about a dozen potential sites were narrowed to a list of four finalists before Doral was selected.\n\n\"It's almost like they built this facility to host this type of event,\" Mulvaney said.\n\nHolding the event at Doral would also be dramatically cheaper than other sites, he said.\n\n\"There's no issue here on him profiting from this in any way, shape or form,\" Mulvaney said.\n\nThe United States has hosted the summit before in Puerto Rico; Williamsburg, Virginia; Houston; Denver; Sea Island, Georgia; and Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland.", "description": "White House says there is 'no issue' on Trump profiting from 'this in any way' despite ethics watchdog concerns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/17/d2cfd2a516a040819f99a77173476248_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
