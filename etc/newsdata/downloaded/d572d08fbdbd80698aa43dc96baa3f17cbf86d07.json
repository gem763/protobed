At the time, Qiqi, who is from China, was an operator of \u201cmaternity hotels\u201d\u2013 a minor player in the underground birth tourism industry around the United States where \u201cbirth tourists,\u201d pregnant women from overseas, can stay before giving birth to children who can receive the benefits of American citizenship.\n\nWe hit it off quickly, and I followed her back to the \u201chotel\u201d in her single-family home in Fontana, Calif., where she housed a couple of pregnant Chinese women who looked downcast as they ate their chef-prepared Chinese dinner. Qiqi fussed over them, taking care of each in her own way. Later, she revealed her plan: \u201cBirth tourism is so pass\u00e9!\u201d she told me. \u201cI\u2019m getting into surrogacy. \u201d\n\nAs you\u2019ll see in the film above, Qiqi is among the growing number of entrepreneurs looking to cash in on the surge of foreign couples \u2014 in her case, from China \u2014 looking not just to have their babies in this country, but also to find American women to carry those babies to term. The American surrogates, who live all over the country, can make upward of $50,000 per pregnancy, depending on location and experience.\n\nWhen I first learned of this phenomenon, I was living in maternity hotels, making a feature documentary about the shadow economy of birth tourism in the ethnic-Chinese enclaves of the San Gabriel Valley. Born in the United States, I had spent my 20s in China. The power balance was shifting and many of us who had left the United States for China were feeling the heady rush of living on the verge of a new world order in which China was rising and American hegemony was waning.", "description": "A Chinese businesswoman in California has become a matchmaker between Chinese parents and American wombs.", "authors": ["Leslie Tai"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/opinion/24opdoc-surrogate-img-alt/24opdoc-surrogate-img-alt-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
