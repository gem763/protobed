The New England Patriots have one of the biggest fan bases in the USA, but also in the entire world. Patriots fans can gather on this page to leave their comments and discuss with other fans about their desired topics.\n\nOn November 16, 1959, Boston business executive Billy Sullivan was awarded the eighth and final franchise of the developing American Football League (AFL). The following winter, locals were allowed to submit ideas for the Boston football team's official name. The most popular choice \u2013 and the one that Sullivan selected \u2013 was the \"Boston Patriots\". Immediately thereafter, artist Phil Bissell of The Boston Globe developed the \"Pat Patriot\" logo.The Patriots struggled for most of their years in the AFL, and they never had a regular home stadium. They played in only one AFL championship game, following the 1963 season, in which they lost to the San Diego Chargers 51-20. They did not appear again in an AFL or NFL post-season game for another 13 years.When the NFL and AFL merged in 1970, the Patriots were placed in the AFC East, where they still play today. The following year, the Patriots moved to a new stadium in Foxborough, Massachussets, which would serve as their home for the next 30 years. As a result of the move, they announced they would change their name from the Boston Patriots to the Bay State Patriots.The name was rejected by the NFL and on March 22, 1971, the team officially announced they would change its geographic name to New England. During the 1970s, the Patriots had some success, earning a berth to the playoffs in 1976\u2014as a wild card team\u2014and in 1978\u2014as AFC East champions. They lost in the first round both times. In 1985, they returned to the playoffs, and made it all the way to Super Bowl XX, which they lost to the Chicago Bears 46\u201310. The Patriots reached Super Bowl XXXI under Bill Parcels, but they lost to the Green Bay Packers. In 2000, Bill Belichick took over the New England Patriots.\n\nThe New England Patriots are currently led by the best quarterback to ever play in the NFL, Tom Brady. They appeared in the Super Bowl nine times in their history, seven of them under the leadership of coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. They won the Super Bowl five times and are currently tied with the Dallas Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers for the second most Super Bowl wins in history. The Patriots are owned by Robert Kraft, who is one of the most respected owners in the NFL.", "description": "This is a channel where the fans of the New England Patriots can find the latest updates on their favorite team.
