She doesn't touch it anymore. She just used it as a relaxant to get her through her GSCEs and she did really well with her results.\n\n'It's up to her to learn from her own choices in life. If I'd have banned her from smoking it every now and then, she would have only done it behind my back as every teenager would do.\n\nThe unnamed mother allowed her daughter to smoke the drug saying it is 'up to her to learn from her own choices in life.'\n\n'I've always had a be open and honest approach with my daughter and it's worked well.\n\n'She hides no secrets from me and her friends, male and female see me as a surrogate mum and talk to me about their issues and problems. I can't see that as bad parenting.\n\nHowever, some parents were left gob-smacked by her laid back approach to her daughter using illegal drugs.\n\nOne woman replied: 'So you found it OK for your child to smoke drugs when taking there GCSEs. WOW!!! Shame on you. You're supposed to be the parent.'\n\nAnd another added: 'You have the right to bring your child or children up how you see fit. But to let them think it's OK to do drugs, sorry, but for me as a mum-of-three that's a big no-no.\n\n'I'm very strict with my kids and they would never ever keep anything from me. Why? Because they know I will find out and when I do then there is consequence and they lose everything.'\n\nHowever, other parents praised the woman's approach to bringing up her children.\n\nAnd another added: 'You have the right to bring your child or children up how you see fit.
