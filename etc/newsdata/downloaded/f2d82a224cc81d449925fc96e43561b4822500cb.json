Although I didn\u2019t get around to trying the trend until 2013, it can be traced back to New York designer Thom Browne\u2019s signature look\u2014shrunken suit jacket and highwater pants\u2014which he introduced in 2001. The prescient style was derided then as too Pee-wee Herman-ish, but mainstream retailers eventually adopted it and, by the time I bought my J.Crew iteration, at least slightly cropped pants were reassuringly commonplace. They still are, but many professionals doubt their appropriateness, as evidenced by my co-worker\u2019s jab. Contrasted with the traditional suit\u2019s staid full-panted look, the sight of your colleague with highly visible ankles is jarring.\n\nLook, we get it, men once wore their dress pants way too long. The more fluid pants of 1980s and \u201990s suits often pooled around men\u2019s shoes, and Mr. Browne was attempting to redress that sin. Julie Rath, a New York City image consultant, feels we\u2019ve overcompensated, though: \u201cWhile we have moved on from the puddling-pant look, some guys in offices are taking it too far, baring mankle [read: male ankle] for everyone\u2019s viewing displeasure.\u201d\n\nIllustration: Dave Urban\n\nFor clients who want a more current look, Ms. Rath recommends slightly higher pant lengths (subtle break\u2014just over the shoe), but ensures that no one ever reveals \u201cany mankle whatsoever\u201d at the office.\n\nGo too cropped, and you risk raising eyebrows. \u201cI think it\u2019s more of an out-of-office look,\u201d said 33-year-old Vikas Mohindra, a senior financial adviser at Merrill Lynch Wealth Management in New York. Though his workplace has become more casual, for many men that just means ditching the tie while still encasing yourself in a suit. Abbreviated trousers \u201cstart to push the boundaries of becoming too fashion-forward,\u201d he said. \u201cYou lose a little bit of the business professionalism.\u201d\n\nThe look is also a no-no in Jonathan Thomaston\u2019s office in Nashville., Tenn. \u201cWe\u2019re a business-casual office, but still more conservative than not,\u201d said the 33-year-old trust officer. He thinks the style might be more acceptable in creative fields than in finance. \u201cSimilarly, what works in Los Angeles may not work in Nashville,\u201d he said.\n\nEven if you\u2019re a Los Angeles-based, multi-hyphenate creative, you might want to consider limiting cropped pants to weekends. Offices and mankles don\u2019t mix.", "description": "While highwater suit pants are now ubiquitous, that doesn\u2019t mean that the sight of the male ankle at the office is any less jarring.
