The strain on manpower and resources has limited the police\u2019s ability to effectively investigate other crimes, with some investigations being shut down altogether.\n\nExtinction Rebellion\u2019s two-week-long \u2018Autumn Rising\u2019 protest this month was at least \u00a321 million. However, it is believed that that figure could rise by several million more.\n\nThat combined with the money spent policing the group\u2019s actions in April, which totalled \u00a316 million, has brought the cost for the year to \u00a337 million so far, reports the Daily Telegraph. That is more than double the annual budget of the Violent Crime Taskforce, which is only \u00a315 million.\n\nLondon is currently grappling with a crime wave which has intensified during the tenure of incumbent Mayor Sadiq Khan. In further bad news for the city, the 2019 homicide rate in London is set to eclipse that of 2018, itself a decade-high year for killings in Britain\u2019s capital.\n\nThere have been 115 homicides in London to date this year, compared to 112 over the same period last year. The majority of 2019\u2019s killings have been fatal stabbings.\n\nPolice vs Public: London Commuters Who Stopped Tube Protesters Investigated https://t.co/MMaOxrhg1i \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 20, 2019\n\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said in a statement that policing Extinction Rebellion events had put a severe strain on London\u2019s police force.\n\nShe said that the group\u2019s actions had resulted in \u201ca less good service to the rest of London. Partly because people get tired and partly because we just had to slow down certain types of inquiries, certain types of investigations would just be done more slowly, and some things won\u2019t ever be done at all.\u201d\n\nDick added that: \u201cWe are certainly at the point where I would say to Extinction Rebellion: this is placing a horrendous strain on London, and on the Met. From the Met\u2019s point of view [this is a] big cost to us and the people who pay for us.\u201d\n\nThe police have arrested 1,828 Extinction Rebellion members this year, only 164 have been charged with a crime.", "description": "The cost of policing protests in the UK by Extinction Rebellion, has cost the Metropolitan Police Service \u00a337 million so far this year.", "authors": ["Kurt Zindulka"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Extinction-Rebellion-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
