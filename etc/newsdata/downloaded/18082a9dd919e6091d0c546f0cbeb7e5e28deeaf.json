NBC News (along with other outlets) is reporting that President Trump has announced that United States troops in Syria along the Turkish border have begun clearing out of the area and will be turning over responsibility for battling the remnants of ISIS to Turkey. This has understandably alarmed those who remain supportive of our Kurdish allies in the region.\n\nThe White House said Sunday night that Turkey would soon begin operations in northeastern Syria to resettle Syrian refugees \u2014 and that U.S. forces wouldn\u2019t be there to help or stop them. In a statement issued late Sunday, the White House said Turkey would \u201csoon be moving forward\u201d with its operation in northern Syria and that the United States wouldn\u2019t be involved. The statement was issued after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke by phone with President Donald Trump earlier on Sunday.\n\nThe desire to extricate ourselves from Syria is certainly understandable. The place is a mess and Bashar al-Assad seems to have survived the tumult with his presidency intact, despite having repeatedly demonstrated that he\u2019s little more than a thuggish war criminal. ISIS is largely dispersed into small bands and their caliphate is destroyed. But that doesn\u2019t mean that everything is coming up roses.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is portraying this as a way to turn over thousands of ISIS captives to Turkey and let them deal with that headache. Again, this wouldn\u2019t be a terrible idea in and of itself if we were looking at this in a vacuum. The problem is our Syrian Kurdish allies. They\u2019re the ones holding most of those captives. And if we \u201cstand aside\u201d (literally the phrase used by the White House) and let Turkey swarm over the border into northern Syria, they won\u2019t just be coming for ISIS. Erdogan has been at war with the Kurds for years and he\u2019ll be looking to take them out.\n\nAnd you can rest assured, the Kurds have already noticed and they\u2019re not happy. (Associated Press)\n\nU.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces in Syria said American troops began withdrawing Monday from northeast Syria ahead of a Turkish invasion that the Kurds say will overturn five years of achievements in the battle against the Islamic State group. The Syrian Kurdish fighters also accused Washington of failing to abide by its commitments to its key allies in the fight against IS. It\u2019s a major shift in U.S. policy\u2026 \u201cThe American forces did not abide by their commitments and withdrew their forces along the border with Turkey,\u201d the SDF said in its statement. \u201cTurkey now is preparing to invade northern and eastern parts of Syria.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s another interesting tidbit from this story. Did this new debacle come about as the result of an errant tweet? (AP)\n\nTurkey summoned a top American diplomat Sunday after the U.S. Embassy\u2019s official Twitter account \u201cliked\u201d a tweet that said the people of Turkey should prepare for a political era without the leader of Turkey\u2019s national party, who is reportedly ill. The Foreign Ministry said the U.S. charge d\u2019affaires Jeffrey Hovenier was summoned despite an embassy statement that said its Twitter account had liked \u201can unrelated post in error,\u201d and apologized.\n\nOur embassy already apologized for their official Twitter account \u201cliking\u201d a tweet that implied one of Erdogan\u2019s political allies might not be long for this world. They supposedly intended to like a different tweet but hit that one by accident. Still, Erdogan flew into a rage and started pointing fingers. (That\u2019s pretty much his brand anyway.)\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know what to make of all of this, coming out of left field as it did. Granted, we couldn\u2019t stay in Syria forever and we were never going to be able to completely democratize the region and eliminate their tyranny problem. Having the Russians lurking around the area along with Iranian backed insurgent groups complicates matters even further.\n\nBut the Kurds have shed blood for us over there for so many years and in staggering amounts. We\u2019re basically their only supporters since the Syrians hate them, Turkey wants to wipe them out, and they\u2019re not even really popular in Iraq except for the northern region they\u2019ve traditionally controlled. I doubt they would even still exist in the modern era were it not for their legendarily fearsome fighters, the Peshmerga. If we pull out of the region entirely and leave them to face the Turks they are going to feel completely betrayed.\n\nOf course, getting out of Syria was never going to be easy, just as pulling out of Afghanistan won\u2019t be. When the American military leaves it creates a power vacuum and someone always comes along to fill it. In Syria, it will probably be Turkey. In Afghanistan, it will be the Taliban. But even if it\u2019s a sound logistical choice, I can\u2019t get comfortable with the idea of abandoning the Kurds. I\u2019ve got a bad feeling that there are some dark days ahead.", "description": "Standing aside?", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TrumpErdogan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
