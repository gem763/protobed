His work ethic is insane. I see him everywhere practising and I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better partner.\n\n\u2018Thank you so much for all your time and your effort. This boy has so much talent, I\u2019m really sad he won\u2019t be able to show you guys any more of it.\u2019\n\nViewers were gobsmacked at the decision, and even threatened to boycott the show in the wake of the judgement.\n\nRidiculous verdict, there are a few other dancers who should've gone before #Strictly \u2014 Lesley McGivern (@summertimesmith) October 13, 2019\n\nABSOLUTE FIX!!! over marking people.
