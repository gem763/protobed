The return of the Islamic State is now a given,\" the Institute for the Study of War said in a brief.\n\nThe SDF have warned that their fighters were mobilised to defend against the Turkish advance and not available to fully guard IS prisoners.\n\nThat has already resulted in the escape of hundreds of foreign fighters' relatives, although Trump suggested the SDF may have deliberately let them go to gain leverage.\n\nHuman Rights Watch warned European countries against attempts to have their detained nationals transferred en masse to Iraq for prosecution.\n\nThe watchdog warned it would be illegal for these countries to send nationals to stand trial in a country where they risk execution and where due process is consistently violated.\n\nA European diplomatic source said France was discussing a transfer with Iraqi officials on Tuesday.", "description": "Kurdish forces held out in a key border town Tuesday seven days into a deadly Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria that has caused mass displacement and...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/09/wire-19731064-1571129867-883_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
