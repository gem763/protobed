There people have to juggle the needs of modern life with strict planning regulations designed to preserve the architecture of the French colonial period, Tuoi Tre says.\n\nImage copyright HOANG DINH NAM/AFP/Getty Images Image caption Hanoi's Old Quarter needs sensitive renovation\n\nThe competition sets the challenge of respecting heritage while improving the quality of life for local people, including their \"spiritual enrichment\", in the hope of encouraging them to take control of their own spaces and \"make the city more beautiful and liveable for everyone\".\n\nThere is also an emphasis on ease of assembly and environmentally-friendly materials, according to Hanoi's Phap Luat newspaper.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nThe key difference between this and other competitions is that you don't have to be a professional architect or even have experience of graphic design to take part, as it is \"dealing with ideas alone\", jury chairman and architecture journalist Le Viet Ha told reporters. The website gives contestants access to simple software to submit their 2D or 3D drawings, but will also accept hand drawings, sketches, photos or even descriptions, then provide technical support to make 3D versions.\n\n\"We want to erase the boundary between people who have graphics knowledge and those who do not, in order to find ideas from everyone in the community,\" said Mr Le, who is also director of the Urban Initiatives Hub of Vietnam's Urban Planning and Development Association.\n\nThe results will be announced on 7 October, according to the contest website, and will include a special prize voted for by members of the public via the project's social media platforms.\n\nImage copyright Stefan Irvine/LightRocket via Getty Images Image caption The competition aims to 'make the city more beautiful and liveable for everyone'\n\nReporting by Martin Morgan\n\nNext story: Broken stars mark Bulgarian communism anniversary\n\nUse #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter.", "description": "A competition seeks creative ideas to make old buildings in Hanoi more suited to modern living.", "authors": ["News Elsewhere...", "...As Found Bbc Monitoring"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17B1D/production/_108735079_witch5.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
