(Picture: Kylie Jenner, YouTube)\n\nKylie Jenner clearly has secret talents we didn\u2019t know about, as a clip of the reality star singing to her daughter Stormi has gone viral becoming an actual meme.\n\nThe Keeping Up With the Kardashians star posted her long-awaited office tour video to her YouTube channel last week, and one part sees her serenading her one-year-old daughter in a bid to wake her from a nap.\n\nTowards the end of the 16-minute video, Kylie walks over to Stormi\u2019s personal bedroom in the sprawling Californian office.\n\nAfter turning on the lights, Kylie finds the toddler sitting up in her crib before gently singing: \u2018Rise and shine.\u2019\n\nStraight bars.
