Its advisers believe the country\u2019s highest court has made it easier for Labour to claim \u201cyou can\u2019t believe a word he says\u201d. In fact, the court stopped short of saying Johnson lied to the Queen in asking her to prorogue parliament. It is possible that the 11 judges avoided the issue of his motive to ensure they could issue a unanimous ruling.\n\nThat won\u2019t bother Labour. Its officials believe the party\u2019s attack line on \u201cuntrustworthy Boris\u201d could have a big impact in the coming election campaign. For example, on the economy. One adviser said: \u201cBoris will attack our proposed tax increases and promise to cut them. We will reply that you can\u2019t trust anything he says, so it dilutes his attack on us.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Privately, some wise Labour heads acknowledge that Johnson\u2019s planned \u201cparliament versus the people\u201d pitch could appeal to some voters, especially the Leavers Corbyn still hopes to attract by keeping his Brexit options open. Johnson can now widen \u201cparliament\u201d to an \u201cestablishment\u201d that encompasses the judiciary. \u201cIt potentially dangerous for us,\u201d one Labour aide whispered.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The excitement at its Brighton conference was palpable. It will now end on a high note. The judges provided a much-needed diversion from the Labour infighting that overshadowed what, with an election coming, should have been a relatively united gathering but was the opposite of that.\n\nCorbyn was quick to make an unscheduled intervention on the conference platform to demand that Johnson resign \u2013 knowing full well he wouldn\u2019t, of course. With parliament resuming tomorrow, the Labour leader brought forward his speech from then until this afternoon. The Supreme Court supplied a much better backcloth than he could have dreamt of during a rocky conference.\n\nIn a confident speech seen as one of his best, Corbyn devoted the opening section to Johnson\u2019s woes. The 45-minute address was pared down, and largely shorn of policy announcements that would not have won much media coverage due to Johnson\u2019s crisis.\n\nWhen Corbyn rehearsed his election pitch, the battle over who is the establishment loomed large. He accused Johnson\u2019s \u201cborn-to-rule Tories\u201d of trying to turn reality on its head by claiming to be the voice of the people. \u201cA political party that exists to protect the establishment is pretending to be anti-establishment. Johnson and his wealthy friends are not only on the side of the establishment, they are the establishment\u201d he said.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling was cast in the same light. It showed Johnson \u201cthought he could do whatever he liked, just as he always does. He thinks he\u2019s above us all. He is part of an elite that disdains democracy.\u201d Powerful stuff, given credence by the judges. The Tories will certainly get personal about Corbyn when the election comes. Today\u2019s speech showed that despite his dislike of personal attacks, Corbyn will meet fire with fire. Boris is certainly giving him plenty of ammunition.\n\nIn an effective line, he attacked Johnson\u2019s \u201cno-deal Brexit\u201d as a \u201cTrump Deal Brexit\u201d that would be the opposite of taking back control, as it would allow US corporations to take over UK public services.\n\nCorbyn told us a little about himself, though I would have liked more. He answered criticism of weak leadership by arguing that leaders should listen as well as have strong principles. \u201cI will be a different kind of prime minister,\u201d he said. \u201cNot there from a sense of born-to-rule entitlement. Certainly not from some personal power trip.\u201d The contrast with Johnson could work to Corbyn\u2019s advantage here, underlined by the Supreme Court.\n\nCorbyn had a free hit today. But he will need to match this strong performance in his Labour comfort zone in parliament over the next few days and weeks, where his battles with Johnson will receive more attention and scrutiny than usual. So far, Johnson has had the better of Corbyn at the despatch box, even if Corbyn is winning 6-0 in Commons votes.\n\nJohnson is unmistakably on the defensive. The Supreme Court has handed Corbyn an unexpected, golden opportunity. We will soon know whether he can take it, and whether he was right to say \u201cthe tide is turning, the years of retreat and defeat are coming to an end\u201d. Before today\u2019s ruling, few Labour figures in Brighton believed that. But suddenly, many more think there is a chance Corbyn might just be right.", "description": "\u201cThe Supreme Court has just written our election campaign leaflets for us,\u201d one Labour strategist purred after its devastating judgement that Boris Johnson acted unlawfully by suspending\u00a0parliament for five weeks.", "authors": ["Andrew Grice"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/24/11/jeremy-corbyn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
