Ideally they would have this wrapped up before the voting begins,\" Sabato said, referring to primaries in February ahead of the general election.\n\n\"Because the longer this is stretched out ... you're going to generate some sympathy for Donald Trump in the long run,\" Sabato told CNBC on Friday. \"That'll do it if they stretch this out for months and months and months.\"\n\nIn fact, Trump seemed to have already cashed in on the development. His re-election campaign raised a quarter of a million dollars in just 15 minutes on Tuesday in the immediate aftermath of the announcement about the probe.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Eric Trump \u2014 Donald Trump's son \u2014 tweeted that the campaign has raised $8.5 million in the last 48 hours since the announcement. \"You are handing @therealDonaldTrump the win in 2020!\" He tweeted.\n\nPeter Trubowitz, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, said the whole affair is \"definitely a big risk\" for the Democrats.", "description": "The impeachment inquiry of U.S. President Donald Trump could turn into a big risk for House Democrats, especially if it gets drawn out, experts told CNBC.", "authors": ["Weizhen Tan", "Jacob Pramuk"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106141719-1569013749457gettyimages-1168723023.jpeg?v=1569013774", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
