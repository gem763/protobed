Rebecca Romijn, Leah Reimini and Craig Robinson were among the future celebrities who made some of their earliest appearances on the hit NBC sitcom. While you might not remember seeing Romijn or Remini, Sherri Shepherd\u2019s Friends debut is impossible to forget. The future co-host of The View had a scene-stealing role on the episode \u201cThe One With Phoebe\u2019s Uterus,\u201d which aired on Jan. 8, 1998. Shepherd played Rhonda, a brash tour guide at Ross\u2019s museum who gives new employee Joey (Matt LeBlanc) the rundown on cafeteria politics.\n\nThough she\u2019s only in a handful of scenes, Rhonda makes an immediate impression with such lines as, \u201cI shared my pudding with you, man!\u201d That was the first time Shepherd said those words, but it\u2019s far from the last time she\u2019s heard them since. \u201cPeople ask me to repeat those lines when I\u2019m shopping for toilet paper,\u201d the actress told Yahoo Entertainment during a recent interview. And because of the show\u2019s long afterlife in syndication and on streaming services like Netflix, Rhonda\u2019s finding new fans all the time. \u201cI\u2019m always meeting new fans who love my lines and recognize me from Friends. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nSherri Shepherd as Rhonda in a 1998 episode of 'Friends' (Photo: NBC) More\n\nShepherd\u2019s Friends appearance came roughly two years into her Hollywood career, which had previously included a regular role on the short-lived WB series, Cleghorne! and guest spots on sitcoms like Living Single. As she tells us, Friends wasn\u2019t exactly known for having the most diverse cast. \u201cThere weren\u2019t many black people on Friends,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI remember I was doing my scenes and the security guard was like, \u2018Girl!\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to Shepherd, her one-episode appearance as Rhonda lodged itself in the minds of other black actresses as well. \u201cGabrielle Union told me, \u2018I remember when you were on Friends and it inspired me! And Aisha Tyler remembered me.\u201d (Both Union and Tyler would go on to appear on the series in 2001and 2003 respectively.)\n\nThe legacy of Rhonda shaped Shepherd\u2019s future career as well. \u201cIt taught me on-set behavior,\u201d she tells us. \u201cIt taught me that the goodwill \u2014 or the negativity \u2014 starts at the top and it works its way down.\u201d Not that her experience with the six Friends was at all negative. \u201cEveryone was so nice,\u201d she raves. \u201cJennifer Aniston came and introduced herself. To have people come in and be nice make me feel like one of the cast, I will never forget that.\u201d And even though the Friends creators have ruled out a reunion show, Shepherd is ready to suit up again as Rhonda. \u201cI would petition! I would lay outside the doggone studio.\u201d With a pudding snack pack, of course.\n\nFriends is currently streaming on Netflix.\n\nWatch: 25 best celebrity guest stars on \u2018Friends\u2019 for show\u2019s 25th anniversary:\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:", "description": "Entertainer says that her one-off appearance as a brash tour guide might be her most iconic role \u2014 and helped diversify the hit sitcom.", "authors": ["Ethan Alter", "Senior Writer", "Yahoo Entertainment"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/K5J.cmcQJlt8r.JRdVivzg--~B/aD0xMDU4O3c9MjAxODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/11d01560-d8e9-11e9-97ee-b8022cf5335f", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
