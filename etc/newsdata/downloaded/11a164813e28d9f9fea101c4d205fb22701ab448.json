Photo: Victor Llorente for New York Magazine/Victor Llorente\n\nBari Weiss \u2014 editor, Times columnist, Twitter pi\u00f1ata, extrovert, and now author \u2014 began the launch party for her first book, How to Fight Anti-Semitism, with an excited introduction. Standing by the window in a private room of the Lambs Club on the night of September 10, having ditched the oversize white shirt and glasses she wore on Morning Joe for a yellow-on-black floral-print dress from Saks, she turned to her aunt and said, \u201cAunt Betty, meet Shari Redstone, queen of all media!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of her,\u201d said Redstone, the new chair of \u00adViacomCBS. The daisy chain that led to Redstone\u2019s invitation exemplified the particular mix of guests who made this night different from all other nights. Redstone and Weiss met at a dinner thrown by Richard Plepler \u2014 the former HBO chief executive and patron of the arts \u2014 and his wife, Lisa. The Pleplers met Weiss, who is 35, not through some philanthropic group but via Times reporter Nellie Bowles, Weiss\u2019s girlfriend of more than a year.\n\nPlepler had been mulling an HBO documentary about anti-Semitism, and Weiss \u2014 galvanized by the mass shooting at Tree of Life, her hometown Pittsburgh congregation \u2014 had set aside another book project to rush headlong into a dissection of anti-Semitism everywhere she found it (left, right, Islamic). So the Pleplers wound up sponsoring Weiss\u2019s first book party. \u201cJudaism, journalists, and \u2014 what\u2019s the third J?,\u201d asked the writer Boris Fishman, whose stories Weiss has edited at the Times and on Tablet, in an effort to describe the scene. \u201cOh, the third J is for \u2018philanthropy.\u2019 \u201d So far, so very Establishment. And yet, like Weiss, it was an Establishment that felt, at least to itself, like a class in internal exile, surrounded on all sides by Trump, Twitter, and timidity.\n\nAs the canap\u00e9s came out (pastrami and pickle on rye squares!), the temperature rose, and the head count approached 140, guests grumbled about Twitter mobs and cheered Weiss\u2019s \u00adoutspokenness \u2014 though not all were so outspoken themselves. Mad Men creator Matt Weiner, who met Weiss through Tablet founder Alana Newhouse, wouldn\u2019t be quoted. Times publisher A. G. Sulzberger said, \u201cI think she brings a terrific and really brave voice to the Times. I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d Asked what Weiss had contributed to the opinion pages, section editor James Bennet parried, \u201cIs that a party question?\u201d before offering that \u201cshe\u2019s got a lot of guts and ambition, and it\u2019s been a privilege to watch her become the writer she\u2019s meant to be.\u201d Asked a party question \u2014 what he thought of the party \u2014 he said, \u201cI\u2019m not an expert,\u201d and wished me luck.\n\nPlepler told me Weiss\u2019s book is \u201csmart, timely, necessary.\u201d In a longish toast a while later, flanked by mirrors and sepia skyline photos, he said she \u201cgenuinely contributes to tikkun olam,\u201d the Jewish concept of repairing the world. But when I asked Plep\u00adler, a Democratic donor, about Weiss\u2019s tendency to anger some members of his party \u2014 she has equated anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism, written sympathetically about the \u201cIntellectual Dark Web,\u201d and critiqued #MeToo \u2014 he went off the record.\n\nWeiss herself was not shy about the barbs. Her teary thank-you speech focused on the book\u2019s subject, using a column by her colleague David Brooks to explain the Jews\u2019 \u201csurvival and success.\u201d But she credited her own social-media survival to her inner circle: \u201cA lot of people, the first thing they say when they meet me is \u2018You seem like a nice person; how do you withstand the things people say about you on Twitter?\u2019 And the answers are standing here by my side. Chief among them is Nellie Bowles, who is by far the most unexpected thing to happen from working at the Times.\u201d She thanked Bowles her \u201cvetting\u201d her online activity.\n\nBowles, 31, who spent the evening bouncing among the guests in a highly excited state, is exhibit A in Weiss\u2019s social eclecticism. Last year, Bowles wrote a harsh profile of the right-wing pull-your-pants-up guru Jordan Peterson just days after Weiss\u2019s sympathetic piece on the dark web (including Peterson). Weiss was once married to a man, but before that, at Columbia \u2014 where she was known for leading a student campaign against anti-Zionist professors \u2014 she dated SNL comedian Kate McKinnon. McKinnon was also at the party; Weiss greeted her with a long hug. In April, Weiss told Vanity Fair, \u201cI don\u2019t trade on my sexual identity in that way for political points.\u201d\n\nAnother strange (figurative) bedfellow, Eve Peyser, presented Weiss with homemade bialys. Peyser, once a vocal Twitter leftist, famously co-wrote a column with Weiss last year, headlined \u201cCan You Like the Person You Love to Hate?,\u201d about becoming friends with the writer she\u2019d once targeted. She\u2019d hoped to moderate Twitter\u2019s position on Weiss (and on people in general) but only brought grief upon herself.\n\nThe depredations of the online left came up often at the party, with little or no prompting. MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle, who has frequently hosted Weiss on her morning show, deplored \u201ccancel culture.\u201d \u201cOn a regular basis,\u201d she said, \u201cpeople say to me, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t say that in public.\u2019 As soon as people start to retreat and not share their views, it\u2019s bad for society and culture.\u201d To Ruhle, Weiss is \u201cthe perfect example of someone who gets unwarranted flak for her thoughtfulness.\u201d\n\nThere were plenty of flak-catchers in the room. The neoconservative New York Post columnist John Podhoretz wandered around in an orange Lacoste shirt and sensible shoes. He finally quit Twitter in March, after several unsuccessful attempts, following a joke about bombing NYU. \u201cTwitter is only good for people until they get around 75,000 followers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the only thing you can do is fuck yourself \u2026 With the exception of people like Ta-Nehisi Coates that people are afraid to criticize, everybody looks like shit.\u201d The fact that Coates did, in fact, quit Twitter, having amassed more than a million followers, after Cornel West called him \u201cthe neoliberal face of the black freedom struggle,\u201d both undermines and reinforces Podhoretz\u2019s point.\n\nCloser to the heat of battle were women who found common cause with Weiss: Katie Roiphe, scourge of the \u201cShitty Media Men\u201d list, who told me she and Weiss had commiserated over their ostracism, and Meghan Daum, author of the forthcoming book The Problem With Everything: My Journey Through the New Culture Wars. \u201cThere\u2019s a sort of ambient dislike\u201d online, Daum said, \u201cand it\u2019s almost become like a signifier \u2026 It\u2019s a way of maintaining your status in the group for another afternoon.\u201d\n\nThe status here at the Lambs Club was of a more traditional variety. Frank Bruni, the liberal Times columnist, defended the need for intellectual diversity at the \u201cpaper of record.\u201d Looking around the room \u2014 the beige banquettes and velvet curtains and atomic-chic chandeliers \u2014 he played with the idea that it might resemble reality more than the internet does. \u201cThis party isn\u2019t Twitter,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think it\u2019s easier for diverse people to find points of connection. [Even] if this were a Bret Stephens party, you would see a far greater diversity than you\u2019d expect.\u201d Stephens, the Times\u2019 most conservative columnist (though still not a Trump fan), was having a bad summer online. After someone called him a bedbug, he wrote to the offender\u2019s boss, and followed up with a column equating such insults with Nazi rhetoric. Bruni was quick to say Stephens had told him \u201cmany weeks ago\u201d that he would be out of town the week of the party.\n\nIn her book\u2019s acknowledgments, Weiss writes that \u201cno one taught me more than Bret Stephens.\u201d But it\u2019s harder to imagine him bridging political divides over brunch or a cocktail party. \u201cI come from a Hasidic family, and I hang out with a lot of very left-wing media people,\u201d said Taffy Brodesser-Akner, the novelist and Times profile writer, about whom no one has said anything negative for a solid decade. \u201cIf you look at that as the spectrum, Bari is one of the only moderates I know.\u201d Fishman, the writer, put it a little more fatalistically: \u201cI\u2019m ex-Soviet, so I\u2019m very receptive to a lot of what Bari has to say. Of course, it\u2019s not enough for my parents and it\u2019s too much for my friends, so reading Bari\u2019s writing makes me feel really close to her and really lonely in the world.\u201d\n\nFishman believes his lefty friends \u201cdon\u2019t want to find out she\u2019s a lovely human being.\u201d The distance between Weiss the public figure and the woman described by these, her cultivated friends, was a popular party topic. But there was also a sense that the person and the persona were starting to merge. \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d said journalist Michael C. Moynihan, \u201cif you had told me three years ago that Bari Weiss would be the object of hate anywhere, I\u2019d be like, \u2018No!\u2019 I mean, if you\u2019d told me Trump would be president \u2014 the whole thing is crazy. I\u2019ve known her for so long, and she was just kind of shy. But seeing her on Bill Maher, I was like, \u2018Who the fuck is this?\u2019 \u201d\n\nOut in the world, Weiss the persona was enduring plenty of publication-day scrutiny. Slate had run a review claiming she\u2019d exploited the Pittsburgh attack, which had killed several of her former neighbors, \u201cas a launchpad for a bizarre and undercooked exercise in rhetorical bothsidesism.\u201d Critic Andrea Long Chu was posting screenshots of the book as evidence of alleged racism. And the Times Book Review had accused her of going soft on the left. But here in the glow, as Weiss hugged and kissed guests good-bye, she told me she was \u201chaving the time of my life.\u201d When I said she seemed unusually extroverted for a writer, she agreed: \u201cMy alternative career path is rabbi or agent. Those are the things I love, making matches with people.\u201d\n\n*A version of this article appears in the September 16, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
