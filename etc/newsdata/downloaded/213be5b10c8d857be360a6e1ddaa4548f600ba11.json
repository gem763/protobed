The Project's Waleed Aly (pictured) asked newly announced MasterChef judge Melissa Leong to explain her previous scathing comments about the show back\n\nIn one of the said tweets, Melissa wrote: 'What happens when you go on MasterChef & then open a restaurant? Apparently not much. Back to 2nd hand car sales then.'\n\nAnd responding to another tweet in 2011, Melissa said the worst thing an amateur chef could do is appear on the long-running show.\n\n'The biggest mistake an amateur chef can make is going on #masterchef,' she wrote at the time.\n\nSorry, not sorry! Melissa (centre), who was sitting next to Andy Allen (left) and Jock Zonfrillo (right), defended her comments and explained why she chose not to delete them\n\nAwkward: In a series of unearthed tweets dating back to 2011 and 2012, newly appointed MasterChef judge Melissa Leong (centre) made scathing comments about the show she now works for. Pictured alongside fellow judges Andy Allen (left) and Jock Zonfrillo (right)\n\nOn Thursday, she told The Project's Waleed Aly: 'We're all humans and we all have perspectives on things that change over time. Why should I scrub all of my social media clean of former opinions that I've had?'\n\nShe added: 'I may not believe the same things that I did before, but I also don't believe in presenting a sanitised version of myself that is highly edited because that is not who I am.'\n\nFellow newly appointed judge chef Jock Zonfrillo added: 'The real reason is she actually has been very busy on The Masked Singer and hasn't had time!'\n\nAs everyone burst into laughter, Melissa, who was sitting next to Jock and Andy Allen during the interview, added: 'It is true. It is really true. The jig is up.'\n\nWaleed concluded the segment by congratulating the trio, before saying: 'It is safer territory to say that MasterChef returns in 2020 on Channel 10. Good luck, guys.'\n\nDespite her explanation, Melissa claimed in July that she had no intention of replacing any of the previous judges on the hit cooking show.\n\n'Let me put it on record: I don't want to be the next Matt Preston. I don't want to be the next anyone, for that matter. I want to be the first ME,' she wrote on Instagram.\n\nFamous last words: Even as recently as July, Melissa claimed she had no intention of replacing any of the previous judges on the hit cooking show\n\nBut after being announced as a judge on the show, Melissa took to Instagram to say she was 'thrilled' with her new role.\n\n'It is with great excitement that I share with you possibly the biggest news of my career, to date,' she wrote on Instagram on Thursday.\n\n'I'm thrilled to confirm the whispers happening out there and say YES! I will indeed be part of the new guard for MasterChef Australia!\u2063\n\n'I could never have dreamed that I would be asked to be part of the next chapter of this great Australian legacy, and it is with deep respect and appreciation for everything that has come before, that we take our first steps into the new.' \u2063", "description": "Newly announced MasterChef judge Melissa Leong has defended her previous tweets about the show and set the record straight on why she chose not to remove them from her social media.", "authors": ["Mark Brook For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/11/19534766-0-image-a-12_1570704982059.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
