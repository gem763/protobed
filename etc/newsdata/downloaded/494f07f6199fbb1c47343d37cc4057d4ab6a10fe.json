(AP) - Apparently, not everything\u2019s perfect with No. 3 Clemson.\n\nTigers coach Dabo Swinney said backup kicker Steven Sawicki would start on Saturday against Louisville after starter B.T. Potter missed a 24-yard field goal try right before halftime against Florida State. It was Potter\u2019s second straight miss after a 40-yard attempt at North Carolina didn\u2019t go through.\n\nClemson\u2019s offense originally lined up for a fourth-and-2 at the FSU 7 right before the half and leading 28-0. But Swinney called time out and sent Potter in for the chip-shot kick.\n\nAfter the miss, Swinney angrily lit into Potter and yelled at him as both walked down the sidelines.\n\nSwinney said Sunday he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with Potter and felt like it was time to give Sawicki the chance.\n\nSawicki made both extra points and a 26-yard field goal in the second half of Clemson\u2019s 45-14 win over the Seminoles.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Apparently, not everything's perfect with No. 3 Clemson.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/florida_st_clemson_football_04015_c0-104-2507-1566_s1200x700.jpg?2aee1c7f760e0544c363cd8e023a0d80e10be8e1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
