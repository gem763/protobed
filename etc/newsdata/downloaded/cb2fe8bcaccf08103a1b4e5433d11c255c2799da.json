They built the house from local Cotswold stone, a type of limestone typically used to build traditional homes in the region.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey wanted to do something sympathetic and do some justice to the setting,\u201d Mr. Rudge said.\n\n\n\nInside, the eight-bedroom house features floor-to-ceiling windows, vaulted ceilings with exposed beams and wood-burning fireplaces.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Cuban Art Has Its Moment in the Spotlight\n\nThe open-plan kitchen and dining room \u201cis really the hub of the house,\u201d Mr. Rudge said. The room has rustic stone floors paired with contemporary kitchen fixtures comprising wooden cabinets and metal worktops.\n\n\n\nOutside, there is a two-bedroom cottage, which could provide accommodation for staff, extra income or a space for guests, Mr. Rudge said.\n\n\n\nThe location of the property, close to the town of Chipping Norton, is roughly 10 miles from Soho Farmhouse, the countryside location of the popular members-only club Soho House, which has locations worldwide including in London, New York and Barcelona.\n\n\n\nThe arrival of the club roughly three-and-a-half years ago has brought increased interest to the area, according to Mr. Rudge.\n\n\n\nMansion Global could not determine the current owners of the home.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-115408?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
