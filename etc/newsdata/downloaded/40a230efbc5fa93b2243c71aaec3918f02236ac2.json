My family\u2019s struggle to find a treatment that would work was one of the most painful experiences any mother could endure. Depression is a wide-ranging problem that demands bold and innovative solutions. But currently, the Food and Drug Administration is taking action to shut the door when it comes to innovative genetic testing that identifies treatments for depression.\n\nWhen it comes to mental health I\u2019ve learned that the status quo often means a frustrating trial-and-error process of medication selection. Advances in genetics are changing that. Innovative genetic testing is now being used to personalize the treatment of depression and mental illness. This testing helped save my 13-year-old son\u2019s life.\n\nWhen my son\u2019s adolescent angst and ADHD intensified over the years into a far more serious struggle with the depths of depression, we pursued a series of treatments. We tried regular therapy and doctors\u2019 appointments, psychiatry, and what felt like endless trials of a colorful assortment of antidepressants and mood stabilizers.\n\nNothing seemed to impact on my son\u2019s condition and well-being. Still, there was little substantive discussion about taking a fresh approach to his medication regimen. At one point, I begged his physician to consider alternatives. It was then that she suggested a pharmacogenomic test that measures how a person\u2019s genetic variations influence their response to different medications.\n\nThe test results immediately highlighted alarming issues in my son\u2019s treatment regimen and the dosages he was prescribed. Together with his doctor, we made the decision to wean him off several of his medications and begin an alternative protocol that was better suited to his DNA. The test helped guide what drugs and dosages to try.\n\nAs a parent who had felt a loss of control, this test gave a newfound sense of control, understanding and hope. The new course of treatment has had a meaningful and enduring impact on my son and the results were evident within months.\n\nHindsight is always 20/20 but I wonder if some of the trial and error in his treatment was avoidable. Innovations like pharmacogenomic tests should play an important role in improving depression treatment and helping patients like my son get better.\n\nIt is therefore deeply concerning that the Food and Drug Administration is taking actions that restrict the use of pharmacogenomic testing. While a level of caution is understandable, it is striking that a regulator would make such a far-reaching move without engaging key stakeholders, including families like mine, who can speak to the life-changing benefits of these tests. Now more than ever, we need advances in technology and personalized medicine to achieve better patient outcomes in depression. We need the government to be part of the solution, not a barrier to progress.\n\n\u2022 Corey Welsh is a health care industry professional, mental health advocate, and the proud mom of two children.
