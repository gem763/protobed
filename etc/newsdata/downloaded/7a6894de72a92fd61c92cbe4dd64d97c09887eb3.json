Saturday will be the first World Championship road race for 34 years to play out on British turf, yet Deignan has ridden every stretch of road before a thousand times, maybe more. She knows every kink in the course, every narrow bridge, every deceptively sharp corner, every lurking depression filled with hearty Harrogate rain. Deignan may not be in the form of her life or in the shape that delivered her 2015 world title, but what she does have is an innate feel for the lumps and bumps of Yorkshire that none of her rivals possess.\n\n\u201cEvery since I started cycling I\u2019ve been riding on these roads, so it will be quite strange when I\u2019m actually racing on them,\u201d she tells The Independent. \u201cI know the whole circuit. Yorkshire roads are undulating all day long. There\u2019s so many unmarked climbs on the course that other people won\u2019t know that I\u2019ll know to expect. That\u2019s home advantage.\u201d\n\nDeignan grew up in nearby Otley and the women\u2019s elite road race will run past her parents\u2019 back garden. Her mum and dad will be at the finish line along with her husband, the retired rider Philip Deignan, and her young daughter Orla who turned one this week, to watch Lizzie complete the race she has been targeting ever since giving birth.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

She had an unshakable confidence in her own speed, positioning herself in the leading group before beating her main rival, Anna van der Breggen, in a sprint to the line.\n\n\u201cObviously I\u2019d had a really successful season, I was the favourite going in there, whereas this season it\u2019s a bit different,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve had to be so patient and progressive with my training to really peak for this weekend, so I don\u2019t think on results this season I\u2019m a favourite going into this race. It\u2019s a different kind of pressure, and having my daughter at the finish line, knowing that life will move on very quickly, win or lose, is definitely a nice perspective to have.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

She spoke to other successful sporting mothers including Jessica Ennis-Hill in order to understand how best to balance breastfeeding and bike riding, before a steadily impressive return to the sport which included a win at The Women\u2019s Tour in June. Can she spring a surprise on Saturday? \u201cThe goal is to win it,\u201d she says. \u201cWhether that\u2019s realistic, I\u2019m not sure, but that\u2019s the whole point of a goal, I think.\u201d\n\nOn what is a difficult course, likely to be played out in treacherous conditions, Deignan knows exactly when and where she will need to be in order to have a chance. \u201cThe Lofthouse climb [a sharp ascent one third of the way through the course], it\u2019s incredibly important to be positioned well before then. It\u2019s a bit of a bottleneck into the bottom of it, then it\u2019s potential crosswinds over the top, so it will be essential to be near the front of the peloton at that point.\u201d\n\nIt is not just Deignan\u2019s knowledge of the surroundings that stands her in good stead. Crowd\u2019s have packed the roadsides around Yorkshire this week, ignoring the rain to get a glimpse of the world\u2019s best riders, and she knows she can count on vocal local support to carry her round.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit surreal, actually. It\u2019s a moment that I\u2019ve been thinking about for so long and suddenly it\u2019s here, but I\u2019m just really excited. There\u2019s a real buzz around Harrogate. I\u2019m a British athlete so obviously the World Championships is going to be incredibly special to me, but I think any athlete competing here will understand and remember the Yorkshire World Championships because of the atmosphere and the enthusiasm and excitement around cycling in this country. The British fans I think are the best in the world. The support will be unparalleled.\u201d", "description": "Lizzie Deignan has a secret weapon.
