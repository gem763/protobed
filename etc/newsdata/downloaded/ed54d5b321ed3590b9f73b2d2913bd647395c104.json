We are a wealthy nation,\u201d Zarif told a group of reporters in New York Sunday. \u201cThe credit is in lieu of the oil [the French] were supposed to buy.\u201d Zarif said Iran is requesting the the $15 billion credit extend until December at which point in time it would request $3 billion per month.\n\n\u201cThat was one way for the French\u2014not just the French but the European Union\u2014in order for them to come back into compliance with the JCPOA,\u201d Zarif said, referring the Iran nuclear deal. He said the U.S. would eventually \u201close its leverage\u201d if it continued to block Tehran from selling its oil.\n\n\u201cThey are the ones who are dependent on the global market,\u201d Zarif said.\n\nIran has been in conversations with French President Emmanuel Macron for weeks about the possibility of pulling billions of dollars from either the French Central Bank or the European Central Bank to compensate for the money Iran lost in oil sales due to American sanctions.\n\nZarif, who is in New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, said the $15 billion deal was just one of several of the Iranian government\u2019s demands for the European Union and the U.S. It also wants to be able to sell its oil and access the revenues made from oil sales. Zarif said the Trump administration\u2019s sanctions campaign was \u201cstarving\u201d the Iranian people and equated it to \u201ceconomic terrorism\u201d, saying Secretary of State Mike Pompeo should \u201cbe prepared to face the consequences in the International Criminal Court.\u201d\n\nOn CBS\u2019s Face the Nation Sunday Pompeo said: \u201cI don\u2019t know why anyone listens to the Iranian foreign minister. \u201cIt\u2019s beneath the dignity of anyone to listen to him.\u201d\n\nSince the early days of 2017, the Trump administration, with the help of hawkish Washington think tanks and politicos, has rolled out what it calls a \u201cmaximum pressure campaign.\u201d The policy relies almost entirely on the implementation of targeted economic sanctions on Iran\u2019s most important leaders, sectors and industries. The plan was in part crafted by former National Security Advisor John Bolton.\n\nFollowing Bolton\u2019s departure, it was unclear exactly how President Trump would move forward with Iran. He has long tried to avoid military confrontation with Iran but members of his administration, notably Pompeo and Brian Hook, the special representative for Iran, have quietly lauded Bolton\u2019s maximum pressure campaign and aggressive attitude toward Tehran.\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration announced that it had placed the Iranian Central Bank under the strictest of sanctions, making it almost impossible for France or any other country to extend it a line of credit. Trump called them the sanctions package the \u201chighest sanctions ever\u201d. Zarif blamed Mark Dubowits, the CEO of Foundation for Defense (FDD) of Democracies, a right-leaning think-tank in Washington that has been instrumental in the shaping of the Trump administration\u2019s Iran policy.\n\n\u201cMark Dubowitz wanted to make sure that neither this president or his successor will not be able to normalize relations with Iran,\u201d Zarif said. \u201cI think President Trump knowingly or unknowingly closed the door to negotiations on Friday.\u201d In August, Iran blacklisted FDD, accusing it of \u201ceconomic terrorism\u201d.\n\nNow, Zarif said Iran is only going to agree to talks with the U.S. and the European Union if the cash starts flowing.\n\n\u201cWhen we went and discussed all of that and [France] thought\u2014and we respect their decision but that does not relieve them of [it\u2019s] legal obligations\u2014that [it] needed to get some green light from the U.S.,\u201d Zarif said. \u201cThat\u2019s a contradiction because if the U.S. is interested in maximum pressure, then they wouldn\u2019t give them a green light and that\u2019s what we warned them about.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast has previously reported that President Trump was considering the possibility of giving that green light to the French. But following the latest attacks on the Saudi oil facilities\u2014described by Trump officials as \u201can act of war\u201d by the Iranians\u2014Trump seems to have completely written off any idea of approving a deal that would benefit Tehran. Zarif flatly denied any accusations that Iran was involved in those attacks, pointing the finger instead at \u201cthe Yemenis.\u201d Saudi Arabia is currently investigating the exact origin of the drones and missiles that were used in the attack.\n\n\u201cI think [Trump] is determined not to get involved in our country militarily,\u201d Zarif said. \u201cBut there are others who are determined to drag him into a military conflict with Iran.\u201d\n\nZarif said Iranian President Hassan Rouhani would introduce a plan, titled \u201cCoalition for Hope\u201d at the United Nations this week. Although he did not provide reporters with the exact details, he said the coalition would include Iraq and other Persion Gulf Countries should they choose to join and would focus on freedom of navigation and energy security.", "description": "Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iran is requesting the the $15 billion credit extend until December at which point in time it would request $3 billion per month.", "authors": ["Erin Banco", "National Security Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569200398/190922-banco-iran-trump-tease_tn1xdk", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
