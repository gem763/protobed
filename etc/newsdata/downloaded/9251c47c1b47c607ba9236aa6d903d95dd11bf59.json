If you\u2019re going to be a totemic target for the Daily Mail or the Daily Express, you might as well dress for the occasion, right?\n\nBut, more than this, I think she may well have a genuine affection for spiders and the work they do, which has always been associated with femininity due to the connection with weaving.\n\nMy suspicion is that Lady Hale was trying to emphasise how, when somebody\u2019s great clodhopping boots trample through the constitutional undergrowth in the way Johnson\u2019s have, spiders have the ability to carefully and patiently weave their webs back together again.\n\nAs she announced the unanimous judgement of the highest court in the land, I think Lady Hale wanted people to see how she was weaving a delicate protective web against the destructiveness of the prime minister\u2019s actions.\n\nThe decision made clear the justices felt the boundaries in that grey area between parliament, the government and the courts had been overstepped. We need these checks and balances to prevent wannabe despots and dictators acting with impunity.\n\nLady Hale is helping to stitch things back together, and not because she is part of an establishment stitch-up \u2013 as the first female president, one with a northern background and a state school education, she is no Jacob Rees-Mogg.\n\nThat act of rebuilding has more to it, and hints at the spider as a symbol of female strength.\n\nLady Hale\u2019s ruling today has the secondary effect of picking up legislation that was dropped due to the suspension of business in parliament. And as a proud feminist, she cannot have missed the fact two key Bills, one bringing in new legislation against domestic abuse and another to update divorce laws and allow no-fault separation, are now revived.\n\nNot only has Lady Hale stitched together protection for the separation of powers today, she has also woven a safety net for women waiting for these vital Bills to become law, ensuring they are not allowed to simply drop off the schedule.\n\nSo I salute Lady Hale\u2019s work and the symbolism, both stark and sophisticated, of her giant spider brooch.", "description": "As statement jewellery goes, a giant diamante spider brooch on a plain black robe is definitely sending a message.
