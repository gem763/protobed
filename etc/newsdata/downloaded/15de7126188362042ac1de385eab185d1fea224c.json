In interview, [the man] said he enjoyed the attention she bestowed on him.\n\n'He said further sexual activity took place between them on perhaps hundreds of occasions. It stopped around about his 15th birthday.\n\n'He was told, bearing in mind he was a boy, not to tell anyone about what was going on otherwise he would end up in prison. As a young lad he believed this.'\n\nThe court heard after the boy stopped seeing Ms Wells he confided with a number of people what had happened before reporting her to police.\n\nMs Wells denied any intimacy took place between them and described him as 'delusionary and a fantasist'. Jurors were told that the police then traced a second, independent complainant.\n\nHe said he was at Ms Wells' home when she talked about 'girls being frigid but women not being frigid'.\n\nThe man said after drinking Special Brew they were on Wells' sofa when she molested him. He said she then undid his trousers before performing a sex act on him.\n\nDelena Wells has denied seven counts of indecent assault at Bristol Crown Court (pictured)\n\n'I didn't try and fight her off,' he said, but added that he was sick in the toilet after the alleged encounter.\n\nHe also claimed that Ms Wells later simulated oral sex with a horse's lead, which embarrassed him.\n\nThe man denied making his allegation just to bolster the other boy's complaint. His wife described him as honest and reliable and said he 'just went quiet' over difficult issues.\n\nMs Wells, now of Carterton, Oxfordshire, denies indecently assaulting one boy and six indecent assaults on a second. The trial continues.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Delena Wells has denied seven charges of indecent assault against two boys at a cottage in Clevedon, North Somerset, and one accuser said he was left being sick after she had sex with him.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/13/20082312-0-image-a-63_1571832870836.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
