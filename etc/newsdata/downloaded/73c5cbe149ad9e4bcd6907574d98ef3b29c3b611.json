It could happen because it\u2019s a certainty that there are current and former Timesmen, from reporters and editors to members of the controlling Ochs-Sulzberger family, who see and rue what has happened to the paper on Baquet\u2019s watch.\n\nThe two most recent editorial catastrophes have been the Times\u2019 errant and malicious accusations against Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh, and the launch of the papers\u2019 so-called \u201c1619 Project,\u201d an attempt to rewrite American history as the story of slavery and racism, then and now.\n\nThat these things have come about since Donald Trump\u2019s election is not, of course, a coincidence. In company with outlets like CNN, MSNBC, and the Washington Post, the Times has been running on Trump Derangement Syndrome since the moment the gentleman was elected president. And this affliction isn\u2019t the worst thing about the paper. The worst is that they\u2019ve eviscerated journalism worth its salt, using every section of their publication, online and print, to introduce opinion into so-called news and feature stories.\n\nIn doing so, the Times hasn\u2019t just trashed its own reputation (which has always been a little overrated), it has acted as the leader of the journalistic pack in the abandonment of the only real virtue news organizations have in a democracy: the reporting of facts, objectively derived and presented.\n\nIn her book, \u201cMerchants of Truth,\u201c the former executive editor of the Times, Jill Abramson, castigates the paper for its \u201cunmistakably anti-Trump\u201d bias, and suggests that the reason for it is management\u2019s perceived need to keep and attract liberal readers, through online subscriptions especially\u2026a business plan that has, in fact, succeeded in bringing the paper millions of new online subscribers even as it has undermined its credibility among the general public.\n\nAnd not just the general public. Speaking in March of this year at a program of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Ted Koppel lamented the front-page positioning of commentary in the New York Times, adding \u201cI\u2019m terribly concerned that when you talk about the New York Times these days, when you talk about the Washington Post these days, we\u2019re not talking about the New York Times of 50 years ago. We\u2019re talking about organizations that, I believe, have in fact decided that Donald Trump is bad for the United States.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Damon Linker has expressed, in the pages of The Week, his reservations about the 1619 Project: \u201cThe point (of the Project) is to \u2018reframe American history\u2019 so that this appalling history stands at the very center of who we are as a country. Achieving that goal has required the Times to treat history in a highly sensationalistic, reductionistic, and tendentious way, with the cumulative result resembling agitprop more than responsible journalism or scholarship.\u201d\n\nEven George Packer\u2019s much-discussed piece in the Atlantic, \u201cWhen the Culture War Comes for the Kids,\u201d could, by his criticism of race and identity-based educational practices, be seen as an indictment of the Times\u2019 1619 Project. Consider, for example, these excerpts from his piece:\n\nThe politics of identity starts out with the universal principles of equality, dignity, and freedom, but in practice it becomes an end in itself\u2014often a dead end, a trap from which there\u2019s no easy escape and maybe no desire for escape\u2026\n\nThe atmosphere of mental constriction in progressive milieus, the self-censorship and fear of public shaming, the intolerance of dissent\u2014these are qualities of an illiberal politics\u2026\n\nIt took me a long time to see that the new progressivism didn\u2019t just carry my own politics further than I liked. It was actually hostile to principles without which I don\u2019t believe democracy can survive.\n\nIt would, perhaps, be of arguably less significance if the people quoted above were conservatives of one stripe or another, but in fact they are all liberals, and that is why Dean Baquet may have a day of reckoning coming his way. These are the kind of people, liberal but not progressive, who constitute the responsible Left, the historic and natural home of the New York Times, and their concerns are certain to be heard, and shared by, others who are close to the Times.\n\nThere is one other reason why the long knives may come for Baquet: In the alternative, they\u2019d have to come for the current chairman and former publisher, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., who in 2014 fired Abramson and hired Baquet, and who, amidst criticism of the paper\u2019s editorial practices by the paper\u2019s \u201cpublic editors,\u201d fired the last of them, Liz Spayd, and eliminated the position altogether in 2017.\n\nPatrick Maines is President Emeritus of The Media Institute, one of the country\u2019s leading First Amendment think tanks.", "description": "Who\u0092d be surprised if, one day soon, there arises a quiet effort to replace Dean Baquet as executive editor of the New York Times?
