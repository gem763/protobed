If you could speak to him that would be great,\" Trump tells Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at one point in the memo.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Giuliani told Fox News that he had gotten in touch with Ukrainian officials at the behest of the State Department. It was one of several times Giuliani has claimed that State officials had tasked him with the mission.\n\n\"I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it,\" the former New York City mayor told Fox News, without naming names.\n\nDemocrats jumped on that to demand answers, even as some Hill staffers privately say they are leery of believing Giuliani.\n\n\"Rudy Giuliani needs to explain this under oath. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee should call a hearing ASAP,\" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire tweeted while linking to the clip of Giuliani's interview.\n\nThat appeal follows a letter from Sen. Bob Menendez (D-New Jersey) to Pompeo sent Tuesday demanding that he hand over records and other material about the department's role in facilitating the Giuliani contacts.\n\nThere is no evidence that Hunter or Joe Biden did anything illegal, but the possibility that Trump asked a foreign government to investigate a political opponent prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who had long seen the idea as politically risky, to announce an impeachment inquiry on Tuesday.\n\nThe State Department would not clarify on Wednesday what role, exactly, the secretary of state or his underlings played in Giuliani's diplomatic and investigatory efforts.\n\nHow to read Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president: A line-by-line analysis of the conversation that launched an impeachment inquiry.\n\nWhile it's still not clear what Pompeo did or did not do, the still-unfolding Ukraine scandal could dramatically affect his standing at Foggy Bottom and on Capitol Hill, not to mention his well-known political future political ambitions.\n\nPompeo is mulling a campaign for the Senate from Kansas; he\u2019s also said to be thinking about a future White House run. But his strategy of rarely allowing any public daylight between himself and the president \u2014 whatever its effectiveness as a bureaucratic survival strategy \u2014 is now proving politically perilous.\n\n\u201cIf Trump is discredited inside his own party, it hurts Pompeo,\u201d predicted Tom Wright, a foreign policy scholar at the Brookings Institution.\n\nState Department staffers, meanwhile, are questioning how the secretary could have allowed the Ukraine-related dealings to go on under his nose, and whether he was complicit in derailing the career of a respected ambassador along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to believe that the secretary wasn\u2019t aware of what was happening,\u201d said one State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cIf he was kept in the dark, that\u2019s even more troubling.\u201d\n\nSome observers warn, however, that it's far too soon to tar Pompeo or others in Trump\u2019s circle, and that doing so could backfire on Democrats. After all, the lengthy investigations into Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election did not yield the incontrovertibly damning evidence that Democrats had wanted.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that there is a real danger of Trump\u2019s opponents leaning out over their skis on this stuff. There is no surer way to galvanize the Trump base than to run Russia-gate again,\u201d said Ilan Berman, senior vice president of the conservative American Foreign Policy Council.\n\nAside from Pompeo, lawmakers and their aides are trying to establish what role certain U.S. envoys played in connecting Giuliani with Ukrainian officials, and whether Pompeo signed off.\n\nThose diplomats include the special envoy for Ukraine, Kurt Volker and the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland. There also are questions about the actions of U.S. ambassadors in other European countries where Giuliani may have met with Ukrainian officials.\n\nOf special interest: the role Pompeo and his aides played in recalling Marie Yovanovitch, the career diplomat who was serving as the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nGiuliani, Donald Trump Jr., and conservative media figures had attacked Yovanovitch, alleging, among other things, that she had expressed anti-Trump sentiment.\n\nThe ambassador, who has spent decades in the Foreign Service, was yanked from Kiev in May, a couple of months before the expected end of her tenure.\n\nThe readout released Wednesday of Trump's call with Zelensky does not mention Pompeo. But in the memo, both leaders trash Yovanovitch.\n\n\u201cThe former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just wanted to let you know that,\u201d Trump says.\n\nZelensky says he agrees with Trump \u201c100 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer attitude towards me was far from the best as she admired the previous president and she was on his side,\u201d Zelensky says, apparently referring to his predecessor in Ukraine. \u201cShe would not accept me as a new president well enough.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch could not be reached for comment; people who know her say she's not talking to press. But a former State Department official familiar with her situation said Pompeo's involvement in her case may have been to her benefit. For one thing, she's still on the U.S. payroll.\n\n\"My understanding is he stood up for her,\u201d the former State official said. \u201cBut he recognizes he\u2019s the secretary and Trump is the president. It might have been worse had Pompeo not been involved. Maybe had he not been, she would have been fired.\u201d\n\nLawmakers also are trying to establish what role Pompeo played in an earlier holdup of hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine. The Trump administration had placed the financial assistance on hold before Trump spoke to Zelensky and asked him to look into the Bidens.\n\nA person with knowledge of the matter told POLITICO that State Department officials told Senate staffers that Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, had told State not to go ahead and obligate the funding to Ukraine.\n\nThe State officials said they themselves had no policy objection to handing over the money and that they were not given any reason as to why it should be held up, the person said.\n\nA Senate Democratic aide said the funding was held up for more than two months, and there are questions as to what, if anything, Pompeo did to try to push it through to the Ukrainians.\n\nA former U.S. official in touch with people in the Trump administration said Pompeo was unhappy with the hold placed by the White House Office of Management and Budget on the Ukraine funding.\n\nBy early September, according to an administration official, Pompeo instructed the State Department to blow the hold and just send the money; State\u2019s share of the funding was roughly $140 million, while the Pentagon\u2019s was around $250 million.\n\nState notified lawmakers it was going to send its share of the money around Sept. 11, timing that coincided with the White House's decision to back off its hold on Ukraine funding, according to people familiar with the issue.\n\nAides to Pompeo declined to comment or did not respond to questions this week. Volker did not respond to requests for comment. Sondland, reached in New York, declined a request for an interview.\n\nPompeo himself has largely stayed out of the conversation, with the notable exception of a Sunday talk show appearance in which he appeared to indirectly defend Giuliani\u2019s contacts with Ukrainians. In doing so, the secretary raised an unsubstantiated question of whether Biden had somehow interfered in the 2016 election.\n\n\"If there was election interference that took place by the vice president, I think the American people deserve to know,\" Pompeo said on CBS News.\n\nPompeo has been among the Trump aides who argued against releasing the notes on his call with the Ukrainian leader, according to a senior administration official. The chief U.S. diplomat has expressed concern about setting a precedent that could affect future conversations with foreign leaders.\n\nPompeo took over the State Department in April 2018. His ascent pleased many U.S. diplomats who viewed his predecessor, Rex Tillerson, as a management disaster who marginalized career experts in the department.\n\nPompeo has strived to bring confidence, or \u201cswagger\u201d as he calls it, back to State. At first, he was well-received, but a number of recent personnel moves have undercut his standing.\n\nThe moves include Pompeo\u2019s apparent inability to fire Kevin Moley, assistant secretary of state found in an investigation to have acted abusively and inappropriately toward career staffers.\n\nPompeo aides insist he\u2019s unable legally to terminate Moley, who has Senate confirmation. But the State Department has failed to respond to several emails from POLITICO over the past month as to whether Pompeo ever asked Trump to weigh in and oust Moley.\n\nThe treatment of Yovanovitch is likely to fuel similar discontent. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing, but not surprising, that another career officer is being mistreated for political purposes,\u201d the State Department official said.\n\nNancy Cook and David Herszenhorn contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1e/e4/3d2080e840ee92b0ef59c1f9876b/19925-rudy-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
