In one such example, Giuliani brought up a debunked conspiracy theory that alleged Biden pushed out a Ukranian prosecutor who was investigating his son, Hunter Biden, who once served on the board of Ukraine gas company Burisma.\n\nFact checkers at The Washington Post and elsewhere found that the prosecutor had not been investigating Burisma at the time he was forced to step down. And others in the global community were also calling for the prosecutor's exit because he had allegedly turned a blind eye to corruption in the country.\n\n\"While you often fact check his statements in real time during your discussions, that is no longer enough,\" said the letter from Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield, two top Biden aides. \"By giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation.\"\n\nThe letter went on to say: \"We write to demand that in service to the facts, you no longer book Rudy Giuliani, a surrogate for Donald Trump who has demonstrated that he will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative.\"\n\nIf the networks do book Giuliani again, the letter insisted that a Biden surrogate been given equal time on the program.\n\nThe letter was sent to presidents, anchors, and executive producers of major TV networks including ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC, reported Ted Johnson at Deadline, who also obtained a copy of the letter from a source in the campaign.\n\nBiden's campaign did not immediately return Business Insider's request for comment.", "description": "Top aides for Joe Biden asked TV news execs, in a letter, to stop booking Rudy Giuliana because he is spreading lies about the presidential hopeful.", "authors": ["Ashley Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d9116d62e22af162f5786c3-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
