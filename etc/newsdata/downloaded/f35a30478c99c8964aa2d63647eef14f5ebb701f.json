Trump summoned Graham to lunch at the White House on Thursday to drive home the point.\n\nAD\n\nAnd Lickspittle Lindsey obeyed. First, he said he was \u201cimpressed\u201d that Trump is \u201cthinking outside the box\u201d on Syria. He reportedly shelved sanctions legislation. And on Thursday afternoon, he marched into the Senate TV studio to unveil a resolution attacking House Democrats over their impeachment proceedings.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe attempted impeachment of President Trump is out of bounds,\u201d he inveighed. \u201cStar-chamber-type inquiry \u2026 a runaround \u2026 off-script \u2026 wrong \u2026 a rogue action \u2026 very dangerous.\u201d He chopped the air. \u201cIf we were doing this, you\u2019d be beating the shit out of us!\u201d he shouted to a live television audience.\n\nHe even talks like Trump now.\n\nCould he be any more shameful? Well, he held his news conference in the Capitol on Thursday afternoon at the same time the body of Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), a leader of the impeachment inquiry until his death last week, lay in state nearby. Cummings was the first African American lawmaker so honored, and impeachment proceedings halted out of respect. Graham didn\u2019t.\n\nAD\n\nThis came two days after Graham, defending Trump, said impeachment \u201cis a lynching in every sense.\u201d Um, because an innocent Trump is being murdered by a racist mob solely because he has orange skin?\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, Graham criticized House Republicans who stormed into a secure room shouting to disrupt impeachment proceedings. He said they were \u201cnuts,\u201d adding: \u201cThat\u2019s not the way to do it.\u201d Soon after came his inevitable tweet: \u201cCORRECTION \u2026 I understand their frustration and they have good reason to be upset.\u201d\n\nRounding out Graham\u2019s week of walk-backs, Graham had told Axios he might consider impeachment if \"Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo.\u201d On Tuesday, Trump-appointed acting ambassador to Ukraine William B. Taylor Jr. detailed such a quid pro quo between Trump and the Ukrainian president trading military aid for political dirt. And Graham? He dismissed it as \u201chearsay.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFormer Obama national security adviser Susan Rice called Graham a \u201cpiece of [same s-word Graham used]\u201d during a podcast interview this week. Rather than join Graham and Trump in public vulgarity, I prefer to think of Graham as the weakest man in Washington. For years, he imitated McCain\u2019s maverick streak. But he was no maverick. After McCain\u2019s death, Graham found himself a new father-figure.\n\nAD\n\nGraham famously called Trump a \u201cnut job\u201d and a \u201cjackass\u201d during the 2016 campaign. But Graham calculated that avoiding a primary fight required him to become Trump\u2019s golf buddy. Graham told the New York Times\u2019s Mark Leibovich that his courtship of Trump was \u201cto try to be relevant.\u201d Instead, Lindsey O. Graham put the \"O\" in oleaginous.\n\nGraham played down his hawkish line on Iran after a Trump scolding. After the Mueller report came out, Graham used his Judiciary Committee chairmanship to echo Trump\u2019s talking points and to spread falsehoods. Graham bravely promised there would be \u201choly hell to pay\u201d if Trump fired Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Trump later fired Sessions; Graham defended it.\n\nAD\n\nNow he\u2019s walking back his impeachment views. Twenty years ago, as a Clinton impeachment manager, Graham said a president\u2019s failure to comply with subpoenas was impeachable because it \u201ctook the power from Congress.\u201d Now the Trump administration is ignoring subpoenas wholesale \u2014 and Graham is attacking the lawmakers who issued them.\n\nAD\n\nIn his Thursday news conference, Graham couldn\u2019t quite bring himself to exonerate Trump: \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on substance,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not here to tell you that Donald Trump has done nothing wrong.\u201d He merely raged against procedures, arguing, \u201cThe process in the House today, I think, is a danger to the future of the presidency.\u201d\n\nABC News\u2019s Terry Moran reminded him that during Watergate, lawmakers took depositions behind closed doors before there was an impeachment resolution, just as the House is doing now.\n\nAD\n\nGraham did not dispute this.\n\nCNN\u2019s Ted Barrett reminded him that during the Clinton impeachment, House Republicans took private depositions before public hearings. \u201cWhy was it okay then and not now?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe inquiry itself became very public,\u201d Graham replied.\n\nAnd so will this one \u2014 leaving Graham looking foolish once more.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Graham wanted to be \"relevant.\" Now he's just a factotum.", "authors": ["Dana Milbank", "Op-Ed Columnist Covering National Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KsyEq4zuGfHhv-GQu_1GJjfgjtY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YVKAH74HWFHQDAMW77YYH7HQVQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
