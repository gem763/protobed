A black Mercedes and a parade of Land Rovers screamed out of two of the planes, headed for the old passenger terminal. Armored personnel carriers exited the other three.\n\nThere were 106 mostly Israeli hostages being held by pro-Palestinian hijackers and supported by the Ugandan army under dictator Idi Amin being held here. The hostages were coming home.\n\nAn Air France plane hijacked from Algiers, at Marseille-Marignane airport, December 26, 1994.

The Israelis flew in some seven planes under the radars of many hostile countries, landing at an enemy airport, pretending to be the caravan of a brutal dictator, and risking an all-out war to save Israeli citizens, losing only three and only one of the Israel Defence Forces commandos.\n\nThe Israelis even destroyed 11 Ugandan fighter aircraft on the ground in retaliation. In three years, Amin would be deposed.\n\nAirplane hijackings dropped dramatically after this incident and a number of Western countries vowed never to negotiate with terrorists, especially the United States. The US does not negotiate with terrorists as a matter of policy.\n\nOutcomes of hostages taken by jihadists, by nationality. New America\n\nIn the years following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, more than 1,200 Westerners from some 32 or more countries have been captured by terrorists and held hostage by militant groups and pirates, demanding ransom or some other concession.\n\nAmericans made up 20% of those hostages taken since 2001, and half of those were killed by their captors. The reason for this is the policy of not giving concessions to terrorists or anyone else who might take citizens hostage.\n\nThe United States believes giving in to terrorist or other militants' demands for ransom or some other concession would just make Americans a more tempting target for those who would take hostages, allowing terrorists to perpetually self-finance through hostage-taking.\n\nAs it is, Americans are twice as likely to die in captivity by their captors while countries who pay ransoms \u2014 Germany, Spain, France, Austria, and Switzerland \u2014 are more likely to have hostages released.\n\nNationalities of murdered Western hostages, 2001-2018. New America\n\nBut citizens of those countries are not taken hostage in disproportionate numbers because taking hostages is risky and not as profitable as other ventures for terrorist groups, such a narcotics, black market oil and arms sales, and human trafficking.\n\nCivilians more likely to be kidnapped are those who are already in unstable areas. Three-quarters of Westerners taken by al-Qaeda and ISIS were freed. Only two of those were Americans.\n\nSince a new hostage policy was announced in 2015, where the US coordinates agencies to secure the release of hostages, six have been released, and none died in captivity. The only hitch is that none were held by foreign jihadist groups.\n\nIt should be noted that the Carter Administration held negotiations with Iran for the hostages taken at the US Embassy in Tehran during the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Not one of the hostages were killed, and they were released on the last day of the Carter Presidency \u2014 all without firing a shot.", "description": "Since September 11, 2001, more than 1,200 Westerners have been held hostage by militant groups and pirates \u2014 about 20% were Americans.", "authors": ["Blake Stilwell", "We Are The Mighty"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8919b42e22af26ec034392-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
