Now we\u2019re turning our Art Club into an interview series in which we catch up with the artists and designers we admire and find out what drives them.\n\nNetflix\u2019s Tuca & Bertie comes from the creative team behind BoJack Horseman, but the show takes place in a much zanier, more surreal world where a boob or two can be seen flopping around jovially at every turn. It\u2019s also way easier to root for its endearing protagonists: two 30-year-old best friends Tuca (Tiffany Haddish) and Bertie (Ali Wong) who live in Bird Town, which is inhabited by animal-people, plant-people, and regular people.\n\nThe show gets into real issues, like asking for a raise at work (appropriately named Cond\u00e9 Nest), dealing with sexual harassment, and messy female friendships, but it balances out heavier topics with gorgeous visual imagery. A flashback to Tuca\u2019s childhood is recreated in heartfelt stop-motion and scenes involving Claymation and puppetry throw all rules of traditional animation out the window. It\u2019s also packed with jokes hiding in the background, inviting multiple viewings so you can catch them all.\n\nThe details are a pure delight, and the show\u2019s art director, Alison Dubois, explained how she and creator Lisa Hanawalt leaned into their indie comics background to make an unconventional animated series. In fact, Tuca first appeared in Hanawalt\u2019s Hot Dog Taste Test, a vibrant comic collection about food obsessions, along with other jokes from the show like her \u201cmeat drawer.\u201d I chatted with Dubois on how the show\u2019s collaborative nature made it stronger, those oven fries, and how a tweet about \u201chorse hands\u201d started it all.\n\nAs an art director, what were some of the things you were responsible for on the show?\n\nKind of designing most of the environments and characters. I had a head start because Lisa had a whole world built already for the characters, but fleshing out what Bird Town looks like and some of the side characters. And then we had a lot of special stylized sequences. Figuring out how those are going to work, and how to make her comics and books translate into animation. Like we have a lot of texts popping up and lists and kind of figuring out how that would work.\n\nI felt like that totally came through watching the show, the way that some of the jokes are visually written out. It really felt like a show that was made by people who have experience making comics and making art for the internet.\n\nYeah, I actually have more experience in that world than in the animation world. Tuca was my second animated show. I worked on BoJack for two seasons before that. I met Lisa through the comics world, so it was very exciting to bring that into this new kind of career path.\n\nTUCA & BERTIE (2019)\n\n\n\nDirection by Amy Winfrey\n\nArt Direction by Alison Dubois\n\nCreated by @lisadraws\n\nFrom the episode \"The Jelly Lakes\"\n\nExplore more shots in our database: https://t.co/z8qbeAhwjA pic.twitter.com/nVn0Az4l7W \u2014 One Perfect Shot (@OnePerfectShot) June 7, 2019\n\nThere are so many incredible shots and small visual details that are so clever. Like this clip from the One Perfect Shot Twitter account where the car is driving on a road of \u201coh shit oh shit\u201d words. Are those kinds of things written into the script or are they born from the storyboarding stage?\n\nA bit of both. I think that one specifically, it was from the boards. I remember early on, they were looking at the episode 1 animatic. Lisa felt that it kind of was sticking too much to the script, so she really encouraged the storyboard artist and the directors to throw away whatever they wanted and insert their own stuff. I think a lot of the writers were surprised when they saw the episodes come back animated. We stuck to the story, but just added more visual things.\n\nIt sounds like there\u2019s a lot of collaboration happening from everyone who works on the show. I saw on supervising producer Mike Hollingsworth\u2019s Instagram that he wrote the joke about the sex bugs at the grocery store. Does everybody get to contribute jokes and play around with what\u2019s happening on-screen?\n\nYeah, I think that\u2019s what makes working with Lisa most exciting for a lot of people, is that she really listens to everyone\u2019s pitches. Even if it\u2019s your first show, she\u2019ll treat your ideas as equally as anyone else\u2019s. I think that got a lot of people excited to be doing the work, and that just made the show better. It was a really fun, collaborative experience.\n\nWas Bird Town inspired by LA at all, or any other city? There\u2019s a scene where Tuca gets on the subway, and it\u2019s just like this disgusting, slimy version of a New York subway.\n\nWe wanted it to be a mix between New York, LA, and Mumbai. Kind of just an every-metropolis, with lots of plants.\n\nI was kind of peeping on your Instagram a little bit. I think I saw that you have a horse?\n\nI wish I had a horse. Yeah, I ride at the same barn Lisa rides at. And then I lease a horse in Orange County. So we kind of became internet like horse friends before we met in person, before I moved to LA. But yeah, we\u2019re both mildly obsessed, maybe more than mildly.\n\nSo you met through the internet just being horse buds, and then you came on to Tuca & Bertie?\n\nI knew her work, and we had a lot of mutual friends through like the indie comic scene. And then, I think, just on Twitter, I tweeted some weird \u2014 this is really silly \u2014 but I did something with my hand that makes it look like a horse \u2014 like my middle finger is the horse\u2019s head. [laughs] And I asked if she had a hand horse and what she named it, and then we just went from there. It\u2019s pretty silly.\n\nThere are so many different types of animation on display, from Claymation to stop-motion, pixel animation, and puppet art. How did the decision to use all of these types of art come about?\n\nThose were pitched by the episode directors. So episode 4, we kind of had our like, pre-thumb meeting. And James [Bowman], the director, just in the middle of the meeting was like, \u201cand this section is going to be a live-action puppet show.\u201d And we were all like, \u201cYes, great! That\u2019s good!\u201d\n\nLisa was so on board. And it was really fun to go outside traditional 2D animation and get to play with things. As in her work, she dabbles with different mediums and kind of using whatever medium fits what she\u2019s trying to say with the work. So it was really cool that we got the chance to do that in the show as well.\n\nSo all of that work was done by the staff or did you have to bring in like a puppet expert?\n\nI fabricated the puppets. We actually had Lisa be the puppeteer, which was very fun. But for the Claymation, we had one of our in-house boarders, Andrea Gerstmann, board it. And then two of our designers, Maureen Kuo and Dante Tumminello, had done stop-motion before, so they did all the Claymation.\n\nThis is just a personal question for myself that I need to know for some reason. But the scene where Speckle makes the two kinds of oven fries, and it cuts to an actual photo of the oven fries. I just want to know if you guys actually made and ate it?\n\nThat was our production manager, Sean. I remember he went out and he was like trying to find the correct oven mitts and the right oven fries and he went to Target during the lunch break and then went home. And I think we had to do like two rounds of the photos because the first ones weren\u2019t burnt enough or something. And I\u2019m sure he ate them.\n\nthere are so many things i enjoyed about tuca & bertie, but i just wanna take a moment to appreciate the pure delight of steven yeun as bertie's boyfriend, speckle pic.twitter.com/OLd9CzdFEl \u2014 Hannah Giorgis (@ethiopienne) May 8, 2019\n\nWhat kind of advice would you give to people starting out in their careers?\n\nOh, man. Definitely stay open to every possibility. I spent nine years not doing animation, and then I was living in San Francisco for a while and just doing independent comics. Then a lot of people were leaving to come to LA and work in animation, so I did that. Yeah, it was absolutely my dream job. Also, make the work you like making the best. I think that\u2019s when you make the best work and then people will find you. And that\u2019s kind of how it happened.\n\nSo what did you study in school? Was it animation or comics?\n\nI studied illustration and printmaking. And I concentrated in comics, I took all the ones that I could take. But I think for this show, not doing animation was maybe a plus, because we figured out new ways to work with design elements that aren\u2019t traditionally in animated shows. Don\u2019t limit yourself \u2014 even if you didn\u2019t study animation, you can do design jobs. Or if you did study animation, but you want to make comics, like there\u2019s so many similarities. Don\u2019t limit yourself and just make all the work you want to make.\n\nAre there any other artists that you want to shout out?\n\nOh my gosh. All the artists on the show, of course, are so talented. I\u2019m so grateful for all the work they put in.\n\nI\u2019m really loving Tara Booth\u2019s work lately. Lisa and I think she\u2019s a total Tuca. And Sophia Foster-Dimino. She\u2019s an amazing, smart, talented comic artist. I\u2019d love for her to come and work on season 2.\n\nWhat are you currently working on while you\u2019re waiting to hear back on a season 2?\n\nI\u2019m on BoJack season 6 right now, doing backgrounds. Also doodling some Bird Town characters for season 2, and doing some large-scale gouache paintings.
