Applicants are still able to take the knowledge-based test at VicRoads offices or with an Accredited Training Provider,' it stated.\n\nBut they're not.\n\nIt's hardly worth complaining about.\n\nBesides, who would listen?\n\nYou'll be told these are dangerous machines.\n\nIn 2016 Ivan Maqi was jailed for five years after hooning in a swimmers-only zone off Port Melbourne.\n\nMonths later a 16-year-old boy was arrested after crashing his jet ski into a boat at Portarlington.\n\nSo a few idiots have spoiled it for the rest of us.\n\nVictorians are a reckless, selfish and dangerous lot.\n\nBut thankfully there are many out there who know how to save us from ourselves.\n\nVictorian legislation is littered with crazy laws.\n\nWestern Bulldogs coach Luke Beveridge hit the nail on the head earlier this year when discussing booing at AFL matches\n\nGel blasters are nice and legal in Queensland. They are children's play toys that would get you shot in the face in Victoria. Or jailed\n\nIt is an offence in Victoria to fly a kite to 'the annoyance of any person' in a public place?\n\nYep. Maximum penalty is a $777 fine.\n\nSinging an obscene song or ballad in a public place can attract a maximum fine of $1554 or two months\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nMess up again and its a $2331 fine or three months in jail.\n\nDo it again and you can cop six months in jail.\n\nIt is still a crime to loot a shipwreck, use a harnessed goat to pull a vehicle in public or correspond or do business with pirates.\n\nA few years back Victoria Police reported an individual was caught practicing hypnotism under the age of 21.\n\nIt is an offence in Victoria to make unreasonable noise with a vacuum cleaner after 10pm or before 7am on weekdays, and 9am on weekends.\n\nThe noise will be considered unreasonable if it can be heard in a \u2018habitable\u2019 room in any other residential property, whether they have the door or window open or closed.\n\nPolice or the council can direct you to stop making the noise for 72 hours and a breach of their direction can carry a fine of up to $18,655, with an extra fine up to $4,663 a day for continuing noise violations.\n\nIn Queensland kids can still buy a 'gel blaster' and shoot each other in the head with soft gel bullets.\n\nPull one out in Victoria and cops are likely to put a full metal jacket bullet into your chest.\n\nBut the fun police are everywhere down south.\n\nSchools have banned the age old playground game of tiggy in Victoria\n\nThere are no less than a dozen criminal offences that can be committed by visitors to the MCG, from damaging a plant to moving a boundary marker.\n\n'Interfering with the enjoyment' of the grand prix is also a crime, as is 'attempting to distract' the driver of a Formula One race car.\n\nSchools in Melbourne have outlawed \u2018tiggy\u2019 or \u2018tag\u2019, with one primary school banning high-fives and hugging.\n\nOther schools in Victoria have banned running, and any games involving leather footballs 'to avoid head injuries'.\n\nBoo someone at the footy these days and you'll be compared to Hitler.\n\nWestern Bulldogs coach Luke Beveridge had it spot on when asked about the topic earlier this year.\n\n'We've become a bit of a nanny state,' Beveridge said.\n\nThe introduction of 'behavioural awareness' staff at AFL matches this season was another sign of 'nanny state' mentality.\n\nA fan was actually kicked out for calling an umpire a 'bald-headed flog'.\n\nFormer Victorian Premier upset the politically correct police this year when he voiced an opinion on heavy handed actions by security at AFL footy matches\n\nThe introduction of 'behavioural awareness' staff at AFL matches this season was another sign of 'nanny state' mentality.\n\nFormer Victorian premier Jeff Kennett went as far as to suggest the officers patrolling AFL crowds were ill-equipped because they appeared to be 'new arrivals'.\n\n'I\u2019m not being racist when I say this, but when I saw some of the footage, the people who are making judgments while they wear these authoritative coats, are not people who appear to have a great knowledge of our game,' he told 3AW's Neil Mitchell.\n\n'And yet they make judgments about what\u2019s correct and not correct.'\n\nHe doubled-down when asked by The Australian if he was sorry about what he had said to Neil.\n\n'I\u2019m worried I\u2019m going to get thrown out of a match,' he said. 'I get very excited watching the Hawks. I love it.\n\n'I don\u2019t withdraw anything I\u2019ve said whatsoever. I don\u2019t make any apology for what I\u2019ve said, because 99 per cent of the public would agree with what I\u2019m saying.'\n\nIn a state where commentating footy can almost get you hanged - ask Eddie McGuire - you have to wonder what Hoges would make out of all of this?\n\nHoges would be turning in his grave about the state of affairs in Victoria - if he was dead\n\nPaul Hogan has admitted his classic show probably couldn't exist today\n\nThe Paul Hogan Show just couldn't exist in Victoria today.\n\nIt would be blocked faster than a pirating torrent site.\n\n'The sketches were designed, not for you to perv on the girls, but to show what idiots we men can make of ourselves over an attractive woman,' Hoges told the ABC's Australian Story last month.\n\n'So it is a bit sexist, and I apologise to the men.'\n\nCan someone get Hoges on a plane?\n\nPlease?", "description": "Victorians are accustomed to being told what they can and can't do by practically everyone.", "authors": ["Wayne Flower In Melbourne For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/04/19868156-0-image-a-4_1571368887846.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
