The publicity stunt comes ahead of the opening arguments in PragerU\u2019s California state lawsuit, which alleges that Google's YouTube subsidiary has \u201cunfairly censored\u201d PragerU videos because of their conservative content.\n\nPRAGERU FILES NEW LAWSUIT AGAINST GOOGLE IN YOUTUBE 'CENSORSHIP' ROW\n\n\u201cThe truck\u2019s screens will play the PragerU videos that YouTube restricts to bring awareness to Friday\u2019s opening arguments in its California state lawsuit against Google/YouTube,\u201d the organization said, in a statement. \u201cThe truck will begin at UC Berkeley and will wind through the Bay area, making stops at Big Tech company headquarters on the way to its final destination, the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite not a single video containing explicit, vulgar or obscene material, YouTube has restricted over 200 PragerU videos, labeling them as \u2018dangerous\u2019 or \u2018derogatory.\u2019 Among these are several videos from a series on the 10 Commandments presented by Dennis Prager, which cover concepts such as \u2018Do Not Misuse God\u2019s Name,\u2019 \u2018Do Not Steal\u2019 and \u2018Do Not Covet\u2019,\u201d it added.\n\nFiled in the Superior Court of the State of California, the lawsuit alleges that the tech heavyweights are \u201ccontinuing to unlawfully restrict and restrain speech and expression on the global social media and video sharing platform known as YouTube.\u201d\n\nPRAGERU EXEC BLASTS YOUTUBE'S 'LAUGHABLE' CLAIM IT'S POLITICALLY NEUTRAL\n\nYouTube has denied the allegations of censorship. PragerU has 2.35 million subscribers on YouTube and all of its videos are said to be available to the 98 percent of YouTube users who have not enabled Restricted Mode.\n\n\"Restricted Mode is an optional feature used by a small subset of users to filter out videos that may include sensitive or mature content,\" explained a YouTube spokesman, in a statement provided to Fox News earlier this year. \"Giving viewers the choice to opt in to a more restricted experience is not censorship. In fact, this is exactly the type of tool that Congress has encouraged online services to provide for parents and others interested in a more family-friendly experience online\"\n\nPragerU is running \u201ctwo-track litigation\u201d against Google at both state and federal court levels.\n\nPRAGERU ACCUSES TWITTER, YOUTUBE OF CENSORING ADS AND VIDEOS, FOUNDER CALLS OUT 'ASSAULT' ON FREE SPEECH\n\nThe legal fight began in October 2017 when PragerU accused the companies of illegally restricting the nonprofit\u2019s content.\n\n.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGoogle declined to comment on this story.\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers", "description": "An LED-covered video truck is driving around Silicon Valley Thursday blasting out PragerU videos that the organization\u00a0says have been restricted by YouTube.", "authors": ["James Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/PragerUSiliconValley.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
