I very much need one or two new friends, yet I can't seem to get past the acquaintance stage. The little one makes it tough for me to join co-workers for most happy hours, but even when I do, I feel shy and don't really tell them anything personal, which inhibits friendship. The other day-care moms and dads seem to have established relationships that I can't find my way into. No time to take up a new hobby or go to meetups or anything. I just want someone, other than my husband, who I can text funny things to and gossip with after the meeting/party. How do I find this person?\n\n\u2014 Can't Make Friends\n\nCan\u2019t Make Friends: You\u2019re not alone in feeling alone. Your stage of life is just very isolating if you don\u2019t happen to have ideal social conditions.\n\nThat also means, though, that your problem might resolve itself eventually \u2014 so don\u2019t feel you have to contort yourself to fix it, and don\u2019t get too upset/frustrated when your efforts aren\u2019t productive. When you lack time, energy or availability to nurture deep connections, it\u2019s okay to rely on half-measures that help you get by \u2014 like those happy hours.\n\nYou can also multitask your socializing and child care with baby-and-me-type programs on weekends. They might not yield lifelong friendships but can add variety to your half-measures \u2014 and at least give you a shot at more. Especially if you push past your shyness and take some emotional risks.\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/for The Washington Post)\n\nAnd don\u2019t be so tough on yourself. When I was in your place, an old friend assured me it\u2019s easier to make \u201cmom friends\u201d when kids get to grade school. She was right, and trusting that kept me from getting discouraged. Little kids are just so consuming that interactions beyond work and home tend to be glancing, distracted, rushed, tired. Those conditions just don\u2019t allow glue to cure properly, for lack of a better analogy.\n\nReaders agree this isn\u2019t unusual:\n\nToddlers are tricky. When my daughter hit 4 and started wanting to have so-and-so over, that's when I hit my groove with other parents. If you can find it in you to say, \"Susie talks about Jimmy at home. Want to meet at the park Saturday,\" I bet you'll make progress.\n\n\u2014 It's Like Dating\n\nStart looking for other people on the fringes who may also be looking for a way to connect.\n\n\u2014 Fringe\n\nA little self-deprecation helps. Share something stupid and funny you did, and laugh about it. I use it to break the ice.\n\n\u2014 Stupid and Funny\n\nI didn't invite One Mom to A Thing, but invited ALL of them to the playground after the mom-and-me class and ALL the kids to my kid's third birthday, throwing my friendship into a giant pack of people in hopes of some sticking around afterward. It required a lot less of me, an introvert, than the first-date-like awkwardness.\n\n\u2014 Introvert\n\nThanks! And now, advice to the advisers:\n\nIf you are someone who has an established group of a parent-friends, it never hurts to invite someone new to play group or game night or whatever.\n\n\u2014 Other Side", "description": "She\u2019s looking for an adult outlet other than her husband, but she\u2019s not having any luck.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "September At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
