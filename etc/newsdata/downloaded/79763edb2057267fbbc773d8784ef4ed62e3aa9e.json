Boks brace for Japan's Afrikaans threat", "language": "en", "text": "Cape Town - For the fourth match in a row, the Springboks will face a team that either has Afrikaans speakers or South African-born coaches or players in the squad.\n\nSIGN-UP | Sign up for Sport24's 'Rucking with Rob Houwing' newsletter!\n\nThis time the Boks are likely to face Lappies Labuschagne, the former Cheetahs and Bulls loose forward with whom Springbok No 8 Duane Vermeulen will be teaming up in a few months.\n\n\"Lappies is among the top four tacklers in the tournament at the moment so it\u2019s going to be tough for us,\" said Vermeulen.\n\n\"Japan have world-class players and guys that are earning respect in-and-out every week.\n\n\"Some of the guys are a bit younger but they are building in character in their career, while Michael Leitch has been around the block a couple of seasons and has been part of teams that have lifted Super Rugby trophies.\n\n\"Lappies was also a young guy coming up when I played. He\u2019s a really good guy, actually knows and understands the game really well and I think it\u2019s fantastic to see him in a Japanese jersey and representing Japan and getting an opportunity to play at a World Cup.\n\n\"It\u2019s going to be fun out there, coming up against your team-mate - because in a few months I\u2019ll be teaming up with him against the likes of Michael Leitch and other guys.\n\n\"It\u2019s going to fun and a good challenge and I\u2019m pretty much looking forward to it.\"\n\nVermeulen will be joining Labuschagne at the Kubota Spears at the end of the tournament.", "description": "For the fourth match in a row, the Springboks will face a team that either has Afrikaans speakers or South African-born coaches or players in the squad.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9481/8b5e96892dd44602831de25a6a07e3e4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
