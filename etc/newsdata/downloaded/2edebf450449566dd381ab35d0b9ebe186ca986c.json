No words, just emojis, one of which was the Australian flag. Whenever a celebrity does this it usually means they\u2019re coming to Australia but Chalamet didn\u2019t explicitly confirm anything so us mere peasants were left to speculate. And then, I got the email.\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet is coming to Australia.\n\nChalamet, the star of Netflix\u2019s upcoming historical drama The King, will be in the country for its Australian premiere. He\u2019ll walk the red carpet in Sydney with co-star and co-writer Joel Edgerton, and the director and co-writer David Mich\u00f4d.\n\nOkay DETAILS: Chalamet will be in Sydney come Thursday, 10 October for the red carpet at The Ritz Cinema, Randwick. I\u2019m not saying you should take a day off work to stand outside The Ritz for Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2026 but\u2026\n\nThe King premieres on Netflix November 1, with a theatrical release in October. The film follows Hal (Chalamet), the reluctant heir to the English throne who wants nothing to do with it. In fact, Hal prefers to live among the people and do as the peasants do. But this all changes when Dad carks it and Hal is crowned King Henry V, forcing him to embrace the life he tried so hard to run away from. Now the young king must navigate palace politics, chaos, and the war his father left behind, all while coping with the memories from his past life \u2013 including his relationship with his closest friend and mentor, John Malstaff (Edgerton).\n\nIt co-stars Sean Harris, Ben Mendelsohn, Lily-Rose Depp (Chalamet\u2019s actual girlfriend, sorry), and Robert Pattinson.\n\nNovember 1, lock it in.", "description": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u00a0is coming to Australia - well, Sydney - for the premiere of his new film The King.
