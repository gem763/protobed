(Sarah Silbiger for The Washington Post)\n\nCurrent and former federal employees and military personnel starting Sunday will have more options when withdrawing money from their retirement accounts.\n\nThe Thrift Savings Plan will begin offering new choices in a move to make it operate more like other tax-favored savings plans.\n\n\u201cWe think our participants are going to like this, and we think this will answer a lot of participants\u2019 requests for flexibility\u201d in withdrawals, said TSP executive director Ravindra Deo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not earth-shattering but it adds significant flexibility,\u201d he said. \u201cThe old rules, the old way of doing things, which were set up 30 years ago [when the TSP was created], were very limited in terms of how participants could access their money.\u201d\n\nThe TSP, a 401(k)-style program for federal employees and military personnel, is the nation\u2019s largest employer-sponsored retirement savings program, with 5.7 million account holders and just under $600 billion on investment as of July.\n\nWhen account holders leave the government for retirement or other reasons, they may keep their accounts open and withdraw the money as a lump sum, in equal monthly payments, as an annuity or in a combination.\n\nHowever, restrictions on those options have caused many of them to instead transfer their money to an IRA or a retirement savings plan of another employer where they have a wider range of choices for taking withdrawals.\n\nUnder the TSP\u2019s new policies, those who keep their money there after leaving the government will be able to take partial withdrawals of any amount as often as once a month. Until now they have been limited to just one lifetime partial withdrawal, with a requirement that they then decide how they want to take out the rest.\n\nAlso, those who take dollar amount payments will be able to change the amount at any time, rather than just once a year, and to receive them quarterly or annually, in addition to monthly.\n\nThose currently working or on military duty will be allowed to begin investing again immediately after taking withdrawals due to financial hardships, rather than having to wait six months. And those past age 59 \u00bd will be free to take up to four withdrawals without tax penalties per year, rather than just one lifetime withdrawal.\n\nFor all types of withdrawals, those with both \u201ctraditional\u201d pretax and \u201cRoth\u201d after-tax investments will be able to better manage the tax impact by choosing to take money from one or the other, or prorated from both as is now required. And investors no longer will have to designate how they want to withdraw their accounts once they pass age 70, although they still will be required to take certain payouts after that point.\n\nThe TSP earlier had announced the Sept. 15 launch for the changes, ordered by a 2017 law. The TSP also will add features to its website, www.tsp.gov, to help account holders with the new options, which will also be available to those who already have started taking withdrawals.\n\nOf the roughly 200,000 people who took what the TSP calls a \u201cpost-separation\u201d withdrawal in 2018, about 54,000 ordered a transfer to another tax-favored savings account, about 41,000 started a series of monthly payments from the TSP and about 2,000 purchased an annuity.\n\nThe rest cashed out their savings, which typically triggers a big tax bill and is more common among those with smaller accounts.\n\n\u201cEvery plan, ours included, tries to make it as easy as possible for people to accumulate wealth for their retirement,\u201d Deo said. \u201cThis change allows us to address the second half of the equation, which is that when they need money to take a vacation, replace a roof, fix a car, deal with life, they have the flexibility to do so.\u201d\n\nSeveral financial advisers who regularly work with federal employees said the new policies address some of the reasons people move their money out of the TSP once they have the chance.\n\n\u201cIt needed a reboot,\u201d said Rich Zeitz of Bravias Financial in Iselin, N.J. \u201cThe lack of accessibility and flexibility and control have been definitely putting federal employees at a huge disadvantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does bring it closer to modern-day practices. Right now they\u2019re really limited,\u201d said Ilene Brostrom of Brostrom and Berlin Wealth Management in Bethesda, Md. \u201cThe ability to take multiple withdrawals, that\u2019s big for some clients. For a lot of people, that\u2019s the biggest amount of money that they have saved anywhere, and they want to be able to tap into it\u201d as they need, she said.\n\nHowever, withdrawal options are just part of a decision on where to keep their retirement savings. In favor of the TSP, they said, are low administrative fees and a fund that pays the higher interest rates of longer-term government bonds but without their risk of losses.\n\nIn contrast, they said, TSP investors often are dissatisfied with the limited range of investment options: just five basic funds, all of them tied to broad indexes, and five \u201clife cycle\u201d funds that mix investments in the basic funds according to target dates to begin withdrawals. Other drawbacks, they said, include a more complex and longer processing time for withdrawals and the TSP\u2019s policy of giving information but not advice.\n\n\u201cThey will have more reason to leave their money in the TSP, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a complete game-changer,\u201d Brostrom said.\n\nZeitz said there are still some things the TSP doesn\u2019t provide.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change people who want to work with an adviser,\u201d Zeitz said. \u201cThey feel like they don\u2019t understand finance or they know that there\u2019s other products out there . . . They all say that they don\u2019t want to leave their retirement to chance. They just want someone to go through retirement with them.\u201d", "description": "The Thrift Savings Plan will begin offering new options Sunday in a move to make it operate more like other tax-favored savings plans.", "authors": ["Eric Yoder", "National Reporter Focusing On Internal Federal Government Personnel", "Management", "Budget Policies", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/U2mzeYZyxq0i4_QqvQHmRtj2nFo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4TF6JAD33AI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
