(Heba Farouk Mahfouz/The Washington Post)\n\nSamir Sabry, Egypt\u2019s most controversial lawyer, made headlines last month. And once again, it had to do with a scantily clad woman.\n\nThis time, it involved J-Lo.\n\nIn a nation where laws permit any citizen to file lawsuits against anyone perceived to be guilty of immorality or tarnishing the country\u2019s image, the 69-year-old lawyer is the profession\u2019s doyen. He touches off fear and disdain nearly every day. By his count, he has filed nearly 6,000 lawsuits and complaints over the past decade against government ministers, political candidates, authors and activists.\n\nWomen, though, are his favorite targets: singers, belly dancers, actresses, artists \u2014 any female Sabry considers inappropriately dressed or disrespectful of Egypt.\n\n\u201cArt was never about ruining the image of a whole country,\u201d Sabry said. \u201cWhat\u2019s artistic about walking onstage with barely any clothes on? This is immoral. This is why I report this filth.\u201d\n\nSabry is a protagonist in an ongoing tussle for the soul of Egypt, the Arab world\u2019s most populous nation. Under the authoritarian rule of President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, the country is seeking to transform itself into a modern Arab state and regain its faded stature as the cultural and economic capital of the Middle East. But a strong undercurrent of social conservatism remains.\n\nLast month, the American pop star Jennifer Lopez was caught up in this battle.\n\nNewspapers and websites in Egypt and in the broader Middle East reported that Sabry had filed a lawsuit against Lopez over her revealing attire at a concert in Egypt\u2019s northern city of Alamein. But in an interview, Sabry denied taking legal action in this particular case, describing the reports as fake news and saying he accepted Lopez\u2019s attire because she was a foreigner. \u201cShe has her own habits and values,\u201d Sabry said, referring to Lopez. \u201cAnd we have our own codes, our own religious values and our own culture.\u201d\n\nAnd Sabry is their self-appointed guardian.\n\n[Egypt protests over viral videos alleging taxpayer funds stolen to build lavish hotel and palace]\n\nSince Egypt\u2019s 2011 Arab Spring revolt, the country has been trying to resurrect its all-important tourism industry, sunken by political chaos and terrorism. Cairo is filled with casinos, bars and nightclubs. On north-coast beaches, where European-style villas line the seafront, young Egyptians flock to alcohol-and-music-fueled parties.\n\nBut beneath the surface, many of the nation\u2019s 100 million-plus population remains socially conservative, including influential figures inside Sissi\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cHe clearly represents a socially conservative strain within the regime,\u201d said an Egyptian political analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared being sued by Sabry.\n\nSabry\u2019s supporters view him as a champion of their traditions and values in a nation that hosts al-Azhar University and its adjoining mosque, widely viewed as Sunni Islam\u2019s premier seat of learning. His critics denounce him as a crusader against freedom of expression, saying most of his lawsuits are frivolous and damage Egypt\u2019s global image.\n\nSabry denies any links to the government. \u201cPeople who attack me claim I am Sissi\u2019s dog or the military\u2019s dog,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t need anything from Sissi.\u201d\n\nThe stout grandfather of five begins his day by reading the newspapers, diligently taking notes in his office, which is filled with model cars, a passion since he was a child.\n\nThroughout the day and until late at night, he watches news on his large flat-screen TV and recent videos on You Tube, searching for anything he considers immoral and anyone to sue. Stacks of yellowing newspapers dating from the 1970s are in the corridors and rooms of his law offices, providing additional research.\n\nHe gets inspiration from everywhere. Last year, one of his grandchildren asked him what was the difference between a kiss on the cheek and a kiss on the neck after watching a trailer for a television show.\n\n\u201cI filed a complaint against the TV series,\u201d Sabry said.\n\nHis first such lawsuit was against a local singer named Rehab in Gamaliya who sang traditional songs too loudly. Sabry felt it sent the wrong message about the country.\n\n\u201cI had him jailed for three years,\u201d Sabry said with pride.\n\nWhen belly dancer Sama El Masry decided to run for a parliamentary seat in the 2015 elections, Sabry filed a lawsuit to stop her. Her crime? She had a bad reputation, the lawyer said. Sure enough, an Egyptian court banned her after reviewing TV shows and You Tube videos submitted by Sabry.\n\nOther belly dancers caught in Sabry\u2019s legal net have fared worse. One saw her television show canceled. Two were jailed.\n\n\n\nSamir Sabry at his desk in the Cairo office. (Heba Farouk Mahfouz/The Washington Post)\n\nIn December, Sabry joined a group of lawyers to sue the Egyptian actress Rania Youssef for wearing a see-through gauze dress that revealed her legs at a film festival in Cairo. They contended that the actress\u2019s attire was \u201cobscene\u201d and undermined the reputation of Egyptians.\n\nSabry also sued a satirical television program that featured a female puppet named Abla Fahita, Arabic for \u201cAunt Fahita.\u201d In his complaint, Sabry said the puppets\u2019 use of sexual innuendo violated public decency and was against the country\u2019s values and traditions.\n\nThe puppet show survived.\n\nOf all Sabry\u2019s targets, perhaps none animates him more than Sherine Abdel Wahab, one of the region\u2019s most well-known singers. He has filed three complaints against her \u2014 all for what he considered unpatriotic comments that insulted Egypt.\n\nLast year, Sabry managed to get the Egyptian singer temporarily banned from performing in the country after she made a joke about never drinking the water from the Nile, claiming it was filled with parasites.\n\nThis year, he targeted her twice \u2014 after Abdel Wahab reportedly claimed that \u201cEgypt doesn\u2019t deserve me\u201d during a New Year\u2019s Eve concert and again after she reportedly declared during a concert in Bahrain that she could talk freely but that \u201cin Egypt anyone who talks freely is going to be jailed.\u201d\n\nAfter Sabry\u2019s complaint, the Musicians Union for the country banned the singer from performing inside Egypt. In June, it removed the ban after it claimed Abdel Wahab had apologized.\n\nAbdel Wahab\u2019s attorney dismissed Sabry\u2019s actions as frivolous and intended for his own self-interest.\n\nWhen he\u2019s not filing immorality complaints, Sabry focuses on politics and corruption. The case he is most proud off, he said, was against Khaled Ali \u2014 the most credible political challenger to Sissi during last year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nSabry filed a lawsuit after an image of Ali using the middle finger surfaced. That was enough to bar Ali from running.\n\nSabry also filed a legal complaint this week against a woman for allegedly spreading false news by saying in a video that there were protests in Egypt in recent days when the state media said there weren\u2019t any. (In fact there were.)\n\nSabry sees himself as a target nowadays. This summer, he said, masked men in a car fired at his vehicle. The threats, he said, won\u2019t stop the lawsuits.\n\n\u201cIt is my duty to do what I do,\u201d Sabry said. \u201cI am doing this for many grandchildren because I want them to be raised in a clean atmosphere. I am doing this because I genuinely love my country.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nEgypt broadens crackdown on anti-government protesters, arresting hundreds\n\nEgypt jails American traveler, saying she criticized the government on Facebook\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The lawyer Samir Sabry says he has filed nearly 6,000 lawsuits and complaints to protect morality and his country\u2019s reputation.", "authors": ["Sudarsan Raghavan", "Cairo Bureau Chief Covering North Africa", "Heba Farouk Mahfouz", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QsUwGIZOc0hdVRXRK4O0oIIDgCs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SN4YWWHAP4I6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
