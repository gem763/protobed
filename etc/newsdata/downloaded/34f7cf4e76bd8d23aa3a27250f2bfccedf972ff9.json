He was prone to dissolving his opponents in acid baths. He turned Serbia into a war-addicted kleptocracy, ruined its economy, lost every war he fought and was deposed by his own people in 2000. To Mr. Handke, he was \u201ca rather tragic man\u201d who did what anyone would do in his position.\n\nI haven\u2019t been able to read Mr. Handke\u2019s work since he devoted himself to the lost cause of Mr. Milosevic and Serbia. By virtue of being Bosnian, I am not as European as the wise Swedes on the Nobel Committee, who awarded Mr. Handke the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday. I am therefore repeatedly failing at not seeking the connection between his writing about, say, a goalie who suffers from penalty-kick anxiety and his belief that the defenders of Sarajevo dropped a shell onto the packed city market only to blame the Serbs for it.\n\nMr. Handke\u2019s politics irreversibly invalidated his aesthetics, his worship of Mr. Milosevic invalidated his ethics. At Mr. Milosevic\u2019s funeral, he said, \u201cThe world, the so-called world, knows everything about Yugoslavia, Serbia. The world, the so-called world, knows everything about Slobodan Milosevic. The so-called world knows the truth \u2026 I don\u2019t know the truth. But I look. I listen. I feel. This is why I am here today, close to Yugoslavia, close to Serbia, close to Slobodan Milosevic.\u201d The writer who could speak those words can\u2019t have anything of value to say.\n\nEvidently, not knowing the truth about Mr. Milosevic and genocide was not a problem for the Nobel Committee, mandated by Alfred Nobel to reward \u201cthe person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction.\u201d Maybe the engaged literature of the great Olga Tokarczuk is to it but one among many aesthetic, ethical options of value equal to Mr. Handke\u2019s.\n\nPerhaps the esteemed Nobel Committee is so invested in the preservation of Western civilization that to it a page of Mr. Handke is worth a thousand Muslim lives. Or it could be that in the rarefied chambers in Stockholm, Mr. Handke\u2019s anxious goalie is far more real than a woman from Srebrenica whose family was eradicated in the massacre.\n\nThe choice of Mr. Handke implies a concept of literature safe from the infelicities of history and actualities of human life and death. War and genocide, Milosevic and Srebrenica, the value of the writer\u2019s words and actions at this moment in history, might be of interest to the unsophisticated plebs once subjected to murder and displacement, but not to those who can appreciate \u201clinguistic ingenuity [that] has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience.\u201d For them, genocide comes and goes, but literature is forever.\n\nIn the midst of a global epidemic of Islamophobia and white nationalism, Mr. Handke\u2019s Nobel Prize has validated an aesthetic untroubled by decency, a literary project whose value should dissolve like a body in acid before the magnitude of crimes its author repeatedly denied and thus endorsed. Mr. Handke is the Bob Dylan of genocide apologists. The Nobel Committee has shown us that it knows little about literature and its true place in this so-called world.\n\nAleksandar Hemon is the author, most recently, of \u201cMy Parents: An Introduction/This Does Not Belong to You.\u201d He teaches at Princeton University.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
