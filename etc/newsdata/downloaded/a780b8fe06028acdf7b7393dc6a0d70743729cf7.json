Then there was lagom, the Swedish mindset of approaching life with an \u201ceverything in moderation\u201d mindset. Now there\u2019s another Northern European trend that\u2019s being embraced as a way to combat our increasingly busy and often stressful lives: niksen. The Dutch concept is as simple as, well, doing nothing.\n\nWhat is niksen?\n\nNiksen \u201cliterally means to do nothing, to be idle or doing something without any use,\u201d says Carolien Hamming, managing director of CSR Centrum, a coaching center in the Netherlands that helps clients manage stress and recover from burnout. Practicing niksen could be as simple as just hanging around, looking at your surroundings or listening to music \u2014 \u201cas long as it\u2019s without purpose,\u201d she says, and not done in order to achieve something or be productive.\n\nThink \u201csimply sitting in a chair or looking out of the window,\u201d says Ruut Veenhoven, a sociologist and professor at Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands who studies happiness. Whereas mindfulness is about being present in the moment, niksen is more about carving out time to just be, even letting your mind wander rather than focusing on the details of an action.\n\n\u201cWe should have moments of relaxation, and relaxation can be combined with easy, semi-automatic activity, such as knitting,\u201d Veenhoven says. \u201cOne aspect of the \u2018art of living\u2019 is to find out what ways of relaxing fit you best.\u201d There\u2019s not necessarily a one-size-fits-all approach; rather, you\u2019ll discover which behaviors are most effective for you though trial and error, he adds.\n\nWhat are the potential benefits of niksen?\n\nIn the Netherlands, niksen has historically been dismissed as laziness or as the opposite of being productive, Hamming says. But as stress levels climb in the U.S. and globally and their crushing health impacts, like burnout, are getting more recognition from the medical community, doing nothing is increasingly being framed as a positive, stress-fighting tactic.\n\n\u201cEveryone is looking for some way back to ease and connection,\u201d says Eve Ekman, director of training at the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley, who calls the national levels of stress among adults and teens in the U.S. \u201cdaunting.\u201d\n\nBut Ekman, who studies stress and burnout, says the research is strong when it comes to the benefits of slowing down, from emotional perks \u2014 like reducing anxiety \u2014 to physical advantages \u2014 like curtailing the aging process and strengthening the body\u2019s ability to fight off a common cold. These potential health effects might be enough to encourage even the most hectic and overburdened among us to consider carving out time to practice niksen.\n\nAnother benefit of niksen is that it can help people come up with new ideas, according to Veenhoven, who is also the director of the World Database of Happiness, an archive of research related to life enjoyment. \u201cEven when we \u2018niks,\u2019\u201d or do nothing, \u201cour brain is still processing information and can use the available processing power to solve pending problems,\u201d he says, which in turn can boost one\u2019s creativity. This could manifest in having a breakthrough solution to a problem on a walk or a great business idea reveal itself while daydreaming.\n\nResearch also supports the idea that doing simple tasks that allow your mind to wander can foster creative problem solving, even improving your ability to work through a problem you might have been stuck on earlier. A 2013 study published in Frontiers in Psychology, on the pros and cons of a wandering mind, showed that this process can help an individual get inspired about achieving his or her goals and gain clarity about the actions to take in order to meet those goals in the future.\n\nHow do people practice niksen?\n\nFor many, doing nothing isn\u2019t as simple as it sounds. In fact, it can be somewhat challenging to sit still and stare out a window, for instance. Hamming says it can even feel \u201cquite creepy\u201d at first, when people are used to doing something at all times. She encourages her clients to push through the discomfort, taking a few minutes each day to practice niksen (she recommends using this resource for accountability) and to work up to longer stretches, ideally reserving one evening a week without appointments and obligations. \u201cDare to be idle,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is all about allowing life to run its course, and to free us from obligations for just a moment.\u201d\n\nWhat are the possible downsides of niksen?\n\nScientific literature suggests that a drawback of letting the mind wander for too long could be getting \u201ccaught up in ruminations\u201d rather than feeling refreshed, Ekman says, which may have some physiological effects. In the 2013 study, Pros and Cons of a Wandering Mind, researchers observed participants had an increased heart rate for a 24-hour period after the mind wandering exercise and had trouble falling asleep the next night. (The researchers noted, however, that these consequences in the immediate aftermath were not predictive of people\u2019s emotional states in the long-term and that daydreaming \u2014 especially about family and friends \u2014 is associated with higher life satisfaction.)\n\n\u201cWe need to train our minds to wander in a way that\u2019s imaginative and creative,\u201d Ekman says. Some \u201cgateway\u201d practices to niksen could be taking a walk in nature or writing a letter of gratitude, she suggests, as a way of easing into what true downtime feels like.\n\nAnd of course, it\u2019s not practical to practice niksen constantly \u2014 we can\u2019t do nothing all the time. Rather, carving out time to be idle balanced with an active lifestyle can maximize the benefits of niksen, according to Veenhoven. \u201cThough rest is functional and may make one feel better after activity, it is not a main way to happiness in the sense of life satisfaction,\u201d he says. In fact, people who participate in more productive activities tend to be happier due to more robust social connections and a stronger sense of self-efficacy, according to a 2016 study of older adults. Research has also shown that happiness begets productivity, meaning there\u2019s a correlation between relaxation, happiness and productivity.\n\nWhat it all comes down to is finding out what ways of relaxing fit you best, says Veenhoven, whether that\u2019s something actively passive and somewhat second nature, like knitting or taking a walk \u2014 as long as you\u2019re giving yourself permission to niks regularly and without an intention.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Niksen, a Dutch concept of \u201cdoing nothing,\u201d is a stress-relief practice based on just being rather than being present.
