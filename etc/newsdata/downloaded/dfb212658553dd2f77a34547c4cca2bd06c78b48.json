Youth were then asked to rate themselves on various qualities, including their self-esteem, risky behaviors (\u201cstayed out all night without your parent\u2019s permission,\u201d \u201ccheated on school tests,\u201d etc.), and perceived discrimination (for example: \u201cHow often have others suspected you of doing something wrong because of your ethnicity?\u201d and \u201cHow often have the police hassled you because of your ethnicity?\u201d).\n\nAt three points over the course of middle school, the youth rated their self-esteem, behavior, and experience with discrimination. The results revealed an alarming trajectory. In sixth grade, among students who believed the system is fair, self-esteem was high and risky behavior was rare; by the end of seventh grade, these same students reported lower self-esteem and more risky behaviors\u2014with no significant differences based on race, ethnicity, gender, or immigration generation (youth from newly arrived immigrant families and native-born counterparts).\n\nWhat\u2019s more, for youth who perceived more discrimination from an early age, system-justifying beliefs were associated with less-risky behavior in sixth grade, but with a sharp rise in such behaviors by seventh grade. Godfrey attributes this spike to a \u201cperfect storm\u201d in which marginalized young people are experiencing more discrimination; beginning to understand the systemic and institutionalized nature of that discrimination; and starting to strongly identify as a member of a marginalized group, seeing that group as one that\u2019s being discriminated against. As for why this leads to more risky behavior, Godfrey points to research that suggests people who really believe the system is fair internalize stereotypes\u2014believing and acting out false and negative claims about their group\u2014more readily than those who disavow these views.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s easy to attribute the increase in risky behavior to developmental changes such as puberty, the fact that the students\u2019 outcomes started high in the sixth grade and then deteriorated suggests that psychosocial phenomena are at play.\n\n\u201cI do think that there\u2019s this element of people think of me this way anyway, so this must be who I am,\u201d Godfrey said, adding that the behaviors\u2014things like stealing and sneaking out\u2014reflect stereotypes perpetuated about youth of color. \u201cIf you\u2019re [inclined] to believe that things are the way they should be, and [that] the system is fair, then you\u2019re maybe going to accept stereotypes about you more easily.\u201d\n\nWhile the sample was relatively small, Godfrey said the findings are informative and mirror prior research. Indeed, previous analyses have found that system-justifying beliefs are associated with lower self-esteem in black adults and lower grade-point averages for Latino college students\u2014though the same beliefs predicted better grades and less distress for \u201chigh status\u201d youth.", "description": "A new study finds that believing society is fair can lead disadvantaged adolescents to act out and engage in risky behavior.", "authors": ["Melinda D.
