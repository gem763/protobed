In the wake of the violent-level typhoon, flooding outside the city is widespread, leaving dozens dead, many missing, and many more injured.\n\nYet the coming of this typhoon wasn\u2019t without controversy. In addition to some expats in Japan taking offense at NHK\u2019s simplified warning tweet, many Japanese netizens were horrified to learn that homeless residents were being rejected from evacuation shelters in one part of Tokyo. According to the Mainichi Shinbun, two homeless people attempted to enter one of Taito City\u2019s four evacuation shelters in west-central Tokyo, and were denied entry because they couldn\u2019t supply an address.\n\nThe news of the policy spread rapidly on Twitter, with tweets as early as the morning of the twelfth, when the typhoon was hitting in full force, getting thousands of likes and retweets. Take a look at this tweet by Agile (@agile_2019), an organization that supports the homeless and needy with food banks and medical consultation services.\n\n\u201cWhen the Taito City Mayor spoke to the Director General of the Disaster Countermeasures Office, the Director General said, \u2018There\u2019s the possibility of further evacuation counsel and preparations, but the Office has decided that homeless (those without stable housing) will not be permitted to use evacuation shelters.\u2019 In reality, Taito City\u2019s Disaster Countermeasures exclude the homeless.\u201d\n\nThis caused an uproar among many Japanese netizens, who thought the policy cruel.\n\n\u201cSo they\u2019re basically telling them to die just because they don\u2019t have a place to live. Horrible\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if they haven\u2019t got a place to live, they\u2019ve still got a body and a life. They, too, have rights under the constitution, and in an urgent situation the City has the obligation to use their authority to protect them.\u201d\n\n\u2018Even though they promise to protect \u2018everyone\u2019, that \u2018everyone\u2019 doesn\u2019t include people who are a burden to society.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019ll be for a long time. It\u2019s just a place to wait out the storm for one night, for the most part. Sounds pretty horrible to exclude the homeless in that case.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a violation of the constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis kind of nonsense will not do. It\u2019s absurd that they would turn away anyone who came to an evacuation shelter, or that only residents can use them. That\u2019s basically like watching someone die without helping.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder if they\u2019d treat travelers and foreign visitors the same way? Taito City\u2019s policies are puzzling.\u201d\n\nIn regards to the last quote, according to the Counter-Racist Action Collective in Tokyo, who spoke to officials in charge, shelters in Taito City were required to prioritize residents, and when asked about travelers, they were told that separate evacuation centers were provided for them. However, those shelters would not accept the homeless either, apparently, leaving no place to go for those most vulnerable to the typhoon.\n\nThough the overwhelming majority of responses were critical of the rule, there were some Japanese netizens who were sympathetic with the homeless yet still willing to understand Taito City\u2019s reasoning behind the rule. Others were in complete agreement with the policy.\n\n\u201cHm, there are a lot of issues. There\u2019s the need to prevent crime, and I think they should have to write down their address. It\u2019s difficult.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the homeless are in danger they can go to the hospitals. We\u2019ll get rid of their lice and care for them so that they don\u2019t infect others. I think it\u2019s impossible for them to be together with the general public. I think this was the correct decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not paying taxes, therefore they have no right to the welfare. It\u2019s the right decision.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tamarin (@tamirin2011), who is a nurse, apparently homeless that have entered shelters in the past have often caused problems for the other people there. Seeming to speak from experience, they related how the homeless didn\u2019t integrate well with the other citizens in the shelter:\n\n\u201cIn the beginning we had plenty of space and we were able to keep the homeless separate, but the group became drunk and rowdy, and they started carrying off boxes of supplies without permission. There were so many complaints about them from the residents. Then as more people came, they began to mix in with the residents, and even when warned wouldn\u2019t be quiet, which started to antagonize people.\u201d\n\nNot all urban districts in the affected area banned the homeless from shelters, however. Shibuya and Toshima Wards in Tokyo were accepting homeless into their shelters, and, according to a city councilor in Kawasaki City, just outside of Tokyo, officials made an effort to inform all of the homeless in the vicinity that there were evacuation shelters open to them before the typhoon hit, even going so far as to leave notes in their usual spots.\n\nToshinori Tabata, assistant chief of Taito Ward\u2019s public relations division, has since acknowledged the criticism over their decision to turn away the homeless, and has said they would like to examine how they can protect and support people without addresses in future by using responses taken by other bodies as a point of reference.\n\nWith all-night businesses like internet cafes and karaoke shops\u2013which are popular, cheap places to stay for those who can\u2019t afford to rent\u2013likely closed for the safety of their workers, many homeless probably didn\u2019t have anywhere to go to protect themselves from the lashing winds and torrential rains besides the evacuation shelters. Hopefully those who were turned away found other places that allowed them to wait out the storm.\n\nSource: Mainichi Shimbun via Hachima Kiko, Twitter/@cracjp, Twitter/@agile2019, Twitter/@tamarin2011\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Typhoon Hagibis turns Tokyo into an eerie ghost town\u3010Pics, Video\u3011\n\n-- Shibuya rats scuttle along streets in the wake of Typhoon Hagibis\u3010Video\u3011\n\n-- Typhoon Hagibis turns skies in Japan purply pink, makes people fear the end is nigh\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/15/japanese-twitter-in-an-uproar-about-tokyo-ward-that-banned-homeless-from-evacuation-shelters/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "Typhoon Hagibis hit the central area of Japan hard on the weekend, thrashing through Shizuoka, Tokyo, and northern Japan and dumping torrential rains in the area.
