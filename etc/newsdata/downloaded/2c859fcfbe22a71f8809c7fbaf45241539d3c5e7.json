He's also known as being the creative mind behind the launch of the \"supermodel era\" of fashion in the 1990s.\n\nLindbergh was often given high praise for his unique aesthetic that showcased black and white imagery as well as very minimal (if any) re-touching.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex paid tribute in a post saying his work is \"revered globally for capturing the essence of a subject and promoting healthy ideals of beauty, eschewing photoshopping, and preferring natural beauty with minimal makeup.\"\n\nFollowing news of Lindbergh's death, celebrities, models, and other industry notables began sharing their condolences.\n\nFellow photographer Steve McCurry left a comment saying, \"A great man and a great photographer.\"\n\nModel Ashely Graham wrote, \"Breaks my heart. He was one of the most energetic, fun and vibrant photographers I've ever worked with. You will be missed greatly Peter.\"\n\nSupermodel Linda Evangelista posted a black and white photo of her alongside Lindbergh saying \"Heartbroken. \ud83d\udc94 R.I.P. my Peet.\"\n\nLegendary model and activist Bethann Hardison left a comment under Evangelista's photo saying how \"devastated\" she was. \"I was with Peter last Wednesday and met his 17 yr old son. I receipt a text from him on Saturday. Peaceful journey sweet man.\"\n\nBusiness of Fashion Editor-at-Large Tim Blanks also shared a touching post. \"If they had faces back then in The Golden Age, they had photographers too,\" he wrote. \"How do you pick a favourite Lindbergh image? This was always mine. His 1989 update on the Fab Four was so droll, so sexy, so COOL. But I could have chosen a hundred...a thousand more.\"\n\nOther notable moments from Lindbergh's work include shooting the cover of Beyonce's 2008 \"I Am Sasha Fierce\" album, as well as the 1996, 2002, and 2017 Pirelli calendars.\n\nIn his 2018 photography book titled \"Shadows on the Wall, he wrote, \"It should be a duty for every photographer working today to use his creativity and influence to free women and everyone from the terror of youth and perfection.\"\n\nLindbergh's work, words, and wisdom will truly be missed.", "description": "Fashion photographer Peter Lindbergh dies at 74.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/peter-lindbergh-gty-er-190904_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
