That changed when they selected Harry 32nd overall in April, however, the first time they drafted a wideout in the first round since 1996.\n\nHarry was the second wide receiver off the board after starring at Arizona State. He was a two-time all-conference performer with 2,230 yards and 20 touchdowns over his sophomore and junior seasons.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, download it now]\n\nHarry was expected to have a chance to crack the starting lineup but only appeared in three preseason snaps in the opener against the Detroit Lions. He left a joint practice with the Lions early on Aug. 6 with a leg injury and aggravated it in the preseason game \u2014 the malady is now listed as an ankle injury \u2014 while missing several practices afterward. Harry did return to practice on Sunday before landing on the IR.\n\nTeams are allowed to designate two players to return from the IR early, so Harry won\u2019t have to miss his entire rookie season. He will first be eligible to practice after Week 6 and can return to play as early as Week 9.\n\nPatriots rookie N'Keal Harry will begin his rookie season on the IR.

The Pats return essentially all their top receivers from last season, save for Rob Gronkowski.\n\nTom Brady made ample use of James White in passing situations, as the running back led the team with 87 receptions last season, and Julian Edelman returns after leading the team with 850 yards in 12 games. Chris Hogan and Cordarrelle Patterson, who finished third and fifth among receivers, left in free agency, but they only combined for 83 targets and 56 receptions last year.\n\nOne of the team\u2019s biggest upgrades will come from Josh Gordon, who will play starting in Week 1 and hopefully avoid further suspensions. He totaled 720 yards in just 11 games, putting him on pace for 1,047 over a full season. His 18.0 yards per reception ranked second in football.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Harry is expected to return this season after missing most of the preseason with various injuries.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SNZq.zom_y7HT7mxCVhDfQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MDYuNjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/n89HENiuFfOO17umNOgvtA--~B/aD0zMTg4O3c9NDUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/af994d90-cd9d-11e9-afff-38b934fe64ee"}
