In tatters, it postponed the 2018 prize until this year \u2014 the first delay in 70 years.\n\nHandke was honoured with the 2019 award, with the Academy saying he had established himself as one of the \u201cmost influential\u201d post-World War II writers in Europe.\n\nThe 2018 prize was given to Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk.\n\nAcademy members rarely make comments on winners, other than the official award statements, but Petersen was one of five external members of the Nobel Committee this year, who were added after demands for outside oversight from the Nobel Foundation which manages the prize money.", "description": "Stockholm (AFP) \u2013 A member of the committee which selects the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature defended Friday the controversial decision to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/89f0d2_austrian-writer-peter-handke-his-support-serbs-breakup-yugoslavia-nobel-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
