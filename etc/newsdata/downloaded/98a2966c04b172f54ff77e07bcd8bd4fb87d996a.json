He proved his point again in the afternoon session, when he broke the 100m Freestyle B grade record. It now stands at 52.98s.\n\n\u201cWhen I compete in backstroke events, I\u2019m worried that I may not perform wells,\u201d the Form Four student said. \u201cBut I feel much more relaxed when I take part in other events.\u201d\n\nAnother teen to set two new records was Lilian Wong Sze-ting of DGS. The 15-year-old first renewed her own record from last year in the Girls\u2019 Grade B 50m Freestyle event with a finishing time of 26.17s.\n\nThis is far from the first time this swimmer has made waves and broken records\n\nThe Form Four student made a splash again in the 100m Freestyle event, when she set a new time of 56.51s, smashing the record of 56.77s set by local swimming star Siobhan Haughey in 2011.\n\nLilian\u2019s schoolmate Tinky Ho Nam-wai, who helped the Hong Kong women\u2019s 4x100m Freestyle Relay team secure a ticket to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, set a new time of 57.26s in Girls\u2019 Grade A 100m Freestyle.\n\nTinky Ho (second from left) now holds two Girls' Grade A freestyle records.

The 17-year-old has decided to postpone his HKDSE, and focus all his energy on reaching the Olympic Selection Time (OST) for more events.\n\n\u201cI already met the OST in 400m freestyle, now the aim is to do it for my other events,\u201d Michael said. \u201cAs for the interschool competition, I will concentrate on the 200m finals, as short-distance races are not my strong suit.\u201d\n\nMichael\u2019s teammate Wesley Ng Cheuk-yin, who crushed the Boys\u2019 Grade A 100m Backstroke record he set last year, hopes he will be in the best form for the finals next Friday, to set another personal best time, as well as taking the overall champion title for his school.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still recovering from my cold, but I hope I will be fully recovered next week,\u201d said Wesley. \u201cSince it will be my last chance representing DBS, my goal is definitely to win the overall champion to fulfil the school\u2019s winning streak for 27 consecutive years.\u201d", "description": "The champion swimmers came from Ying Wa College, Diocesan Boys\u2019 School and Diocesan Girls\u2019 School.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/img9794.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
