It is curable if treated early enough.\n\nScientists tested the app on more than 52,000 'casual photographs' of 20 children with a range of eye conditions, like retinoblastoma, and 20 healthy controls.\n\nIn four out of five of the children with eye disorders, the app detected white eye in photos taken an average of 1.3 years before they were diagnosed.\n\nThe scientists hope the technology will enable young sufferers to be treated sooner, boosting their chances of recovering.\n\nThe free app White Eye Detector looks for leukocoria, an abnormal white glow in the pupil that can be picked up during photographs. This can be a sign of a range of eye conditions, including the cancer retinoblastoma. When tested in more than 52,000 pictures of children with and without healthy eyes, the app detected disease early in four out of five cases\n\nThe app was created by a team at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, who 'trained' it to detect white eye.\n\nIt uses technology called CRADLE, which is trained to automatically analyse the photographs in a smartphone's library.\n\n'The CRADLE application privately analyses digital imagery stored directly on the user's device, without the need to upload a photograph,' study author Michael Munson said.\n\n'This study suggests a parent can use a smartphone application, such as CRADLE, to detect leukocoria.'\n\nWHAT IS LEUKOCORIA? Leukocoria, the medical term for an abnormal white reflection in the pupil, is often one of the first signs of retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma is a rare form of cancer in the eye which usually affects children under the age of five. About 300 children in the US develop it each year alongside 50 in the UK, according to figures. It causes noticeable changes to the eye so is often caught early on \u2013 around 98 per cent of children with the disease are successfully treated.\n\nThe scientists tested the app on on 52,982 casual photos of 40 children. Half of these youngsters had conditions like retinoblastoma.\n\nThis affects around 40 children a year in the UK, making up three per cent of all childhood cancers, Children with Cancer UK statistics show. And in the US, around 200-to-300 youngsters are expected to be diagnosed a year, according to Cancer.net\n\nThe app was also tested on children with Coats' disease, which causes abnormal blood vessels in the retina and can lead to blindness.\n\nOthers had cataracts, amblyopia or a 'lazy eye', and hyperopia, also known as farsightedness.\n\n'For 80 per cent of children with eye disorders, the application detected leukocoria in photographs taken before diagnosis by 1.3 years,' Mr Munson said.\n\nThe study is published in the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nOf the photographs included in the study, the app picked up on leukocoria on average 1.3 years before most of the patients were diagnosed. This could allow disease to be treated sooner\n\nWHAT IS RETINOBLASTOMA? Retinoblastoma is a rare type of eye cancer that usually affects children under the age of five. As it is usually caught early in the UK, 98 per cent of children with the disease are successfully treated. About 50 children develop the condition every year in Britain. It affects up to 300 youngsters annually in the US. Retinoblastoma is specifically a cancer of the retina, which is the light-sensitive lining at the back of the eye. It can affect one or both eyes. A fault gene is responsible in about 40 per cent of cases. This can be inherited from the sufferer\u2019s parents or may occur spontaneously. The most common symptoms are the pupil looking like a cat\u2019s eye and the child developing a squint. The cat eye look is most commonly seen in photos. Small tumours can usually be treated with laser or freezing treatment. Larger tumours may require chemotherapy or surgery. Source: NHS Choices\n\nDoctors currently rely on the 'red reflex test'. This is a non-invasive way of looking for early warning signs of serious eye conditions.\n\nWhen the eye is healthy, a camera flash usually causes the blood-rich retina to light up.\n\nThis requires both eyes to be looking directly at the camera, making casual photographs tricky to assess.\n\n'Digital photography, including personal photographs collected by parents of children engaged in activities and settings typical of childhood, represents a feasible supplement for conventional leukocoria screening,' Mr Munson said.\n\n'A parent will photograph their child's eyes more often than primary care physicians will perform a red reflex test.\n\n'Each photograph collected by a parent, hundreds or thousands throughout childhood, has the potential to represent a frequent test for leukocoria.'\n\nThe scientists hope to improve the app to produce fewer false positives.\n\nThey claim it only detects leukocoria in every third photo in which it is present.\n\nHowever, the app is more reliable when screening large numbers of photos.\n\nIn the meantime, it is already available to download.\n\n'For humanitarian reasons, the prototype was immediately uploaded to the Apple App Store and Google Play under the name \"White Eye Detector\",' Dr Munson said.\n\n'Since being released for Android and iOS devices, the free CRADLE prototype has been downloaded on to 100,000 devices by people on every continent excluding Antarctica.\n\n'We cannot track and quantify the impact of these CRADLE prototypes.\n\n'[However], media outlets have reported incidents of parents who initiated early diagnoses of retinoblastoma, Coats' disease, and myelin retinal nerve fibre layer in their children'.\n\nThis reportedly occurred after the parents used the app on their children's photographs and showed the results to their doctor.\n\nThe American Academy of Paediatrics recommends all children showing signs of white eye be examined by an ophthalmologist.", "description": "Scientists from Baylor University in Waco, Texas, ran the app on more than 52,000 'casual photographs' of 20 children with a range of eye conditions and 20 healthy controls.", "authors": ["Alexandra Thompson Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/17/19215350-0-image-a-2_1570033417381.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
