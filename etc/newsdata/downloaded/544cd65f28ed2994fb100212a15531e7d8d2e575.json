When West came on stage he announced that his new album Jesus Is King 'is out'\n\nReversal: Not long after his Kimmel appearance aired on the east coast, West took to twitter to essentially reveal that the album was being delayed so three song could be remixed\n\nDuring his spot on Kimmel, West also talked about his religious awakening that inspired his album and the accompanied IMAX film of the same name.\n\n'I feel that God is using me and using the choir and using my family to show off,' he said as reported by the Daily News.\n\nWest set up a brief clip from the film and and he revealed he would be back on Friday night's episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live to perform music from Jesus Is King.\n\nTeaser: Earlier in the day, the hip-hop legend shared the tracklist to Jesus Is King, hours before it was supposed to drop at midnight; he is pictured during an event in NYC on Thursday\n\nDrastic difference: West's updated tracklist for Jesus Is King only contains four songs with the title that wife Kim Kardashian shared in late August\n\nEarlier in the day, thinking the much-hyped album would be ready for release, West took to social media to gave a sneak preview to the tracklist.\n\nIt features a number of songs he shared during listening party events in New York in late September when the album was originally slated to be released.\n\nBut the updated tracklist, shared by West, is drastically different from the one that wife Kim Kardashian posted on her social media platforms in August. On first notice, the new list features 11 songs, compared to the 12 that Kim K put out.\n\nBut the most glaring difference is that only four of the titles shared by the reality superstar remain on her husband's final list. That means either West changed the titles of many of the tunes, or he had a serious change of heart and scrapped some, or all, of the other songs altogether.\n\nMulti-media: West is also slated to release an IMAX film of the same name on Friday; the couple attended the Fashion Group International's 2019 Night of Stars on Oct 24, 2019 in NYC\n\nWest has been very open that the theme of the album is focused on his new-found devotion to Jesus and Christianity as a whole.\n\nAnd the song titles are a direct reflection of his faith with names like: Follow God, On God, God Is, Jesus Is Lord and Use The Gospel.\n\nOther title include: Closed On Sunday, Every Hour, Selah, Water, Hands On and Everything We Need.\n\nAlong with the new tracklist, Team West also posted about a pop-up store promo this coming weekend.\n\n'WORD ON THE STREET IS WE GETTING A #JESUSISKING POP-UP STORE IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES THIS WEEKEND,' it said in the caption, along with the prayer, alien and palm tree emojis.\n\nOne with the fans: The hip-hop superstar has been hosting listening party events like the one he held at The Forum in Inglewood, California on Wednesday, October 23\n\nPromo mode: West's Instagram platform posted that there will be a Jesus Is King pop-up store this coming weekend in Los Angeles\n\nKanye fans can also expect another new studio album on Christmas Day.\n\nIn an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music\u2019s Beats 1, West revealed the forthcoming project -- Jesus Is Born -- is a 'Sunday Service album.'\n\nDuring the sit-down he also discussed a potential presidential run possibly in 2024; that he kicked an addiction to porn; and that his stay in a hospital due to a 'psychiatric emergency' in 2016 led him to Christianity.\n\n'Now that I'm in service to Christ, my job is to spread the gospel, to let people know what Jesus has done for me,' he confessed.", "description": "Kanye West made a surprise guest appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live and announced new album Jesus Is King is out, only to tweet hours later that it was delayed again.", "authors": ["Kevin Kayhart For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/07/20168368-0-image-a-65_1571985433773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
