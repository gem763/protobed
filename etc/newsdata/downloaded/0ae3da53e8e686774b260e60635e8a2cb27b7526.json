As it slowly approached this level, it is highly likely that any movement above this level could lead to a swift rejection or could spark a short-term uptrend.\n\nThe Crypto Dog, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, recently spoke about ETH, noting that it is currently trading within a falling wedge that could lead it to surge significantly higher in the near-term.\n\n\u201c$ETH / $USDT: Weekly chart doesn\u2019t get much cleaner than that,\u201d he explained while pointing to the below chart.\n\nIs ETH\u2019s Current Pump a \u201cFake-Out\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that the recent surge in the altcoin markets has not been driven by Bitcoin\u2019s price action, which could signal that this latest movement will be fleeting, especially if BTC begins moving lower in the near-term.\n\nJosh Rager, another popular analyst, explained in a recent tweet that Ethereum has \u201cfake pumped\u201d on multiple occasions as of late, which could mean that this movement towards $185 will ultimately result in lower lows for the crypto.\n\n\u201c$ETH: What\u2019s confirmation? How about price actually breaking and holding the 20 MA for once. Buyers have been pump-faked by ETH more than a Harlem Globetrotters basketball game,\u201d he noted.\n\n$ETH: What's confirmation?
