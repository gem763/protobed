Underneath lies a tradition of government that is being tested to its limits, leading to questions about whether the country needs a written constitution like the U.S.\n\nFaultlines have opened up in Britain\u2019s system of government. The fissures have been exposed by the deep divisions created by Brexit and the fact that the Conservative governments that have been trying to secure the country\u2019s departure from the European Union are in a minority in the House of Commons.\n\nIn this crisis, the prime minister\u2019s powers, inherited from the ancient rights of the monarch, are clashing with those of elected lawmakers. The courts are venturing into high politics in ways they never have before and the 2016 referendum to leave the EU has opened up a conflict between two visions of democracy.\n\nThe man at the center of the parliamentary spectacle now thinks the U.K. should consider writing down its constitution. John Bercow, the departing speaker of the House of Commons, said in a speech Thursday that, having been a skeptic about \u201ceither the desirability or practicality of writing a U.K. constitution,\u201d he now believed it should be explored.\n\nBritain is one of a handful of countries\u2014New Zealand and Israel are others\u2014that don\u2019t have a codified constitution. It governs itself based on an amalgam of conventions, laws and precedents, and the idea that politicians will do their best to respect what has happened before. This is called sometimes the \u201cgood chap\u201d approach to government. It is underpinned by the simple principle that Parliament alone can make or abolish laws.\n\nThis has worked pretty well for centuries. Normally, a tame majority of party lawmakers wave government legislation through Parliament. But since 2017, the minority governments of Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his predecessor, Theresa May, have seen their initiatives on Brexit, one of the most significant challenges to the country in generations, repeatedly thwarted by lawmakers.\n\nThis has pushed the government on one side and opposition lawmakers\u2014aided by Mr. Bercow\u2014on the other to stretch precedent to the limit to promote their own agendas.\n\nWith both sides gridlocked, the courts are being dragged into the fray. \u201cIt does feel that something is changing and not that subtly,\u201d says Catherine Haddon, a historian at the Institute for Government, a think tank.\n\nOn Tuesday, Britain\u2019s Supreme Court will consider complaints that Mr. Johnson unlawfully advised Queen Elizabeth II to suspend\u2014or prorogue\u2014Parliament for five weeks.\n\nA group of lawmakers say this was done to reduce Parliament\u2019s scrutiny of his Brexit policies and claim the prime minister misled the queen, which he denies. The government says that suspending Parliament is a normal procedure used to refresh the legislative agenda.\n\nAnti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller speaks outside the High Court in London on Sept. 6, after the court rejected a legal challenge to the government\u2019s suspension of Parliament.

Its advantage for Mr. Johnson was that lawmakers don\u2019t get a chance to vote on it.\n\nNormally, proroguing is uncontroversial, but a five-week suspension is longer than usual at this time of year. Mr. Johnson\u2019s opponents argue that if the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t intervene, saying it is simply a political matter for the executive, why couldn\u2019t a prime minister prorogue Parliament for, say, a year?\n\nThe whole debate \u201cis really showing up the weaknesses in our political constitution,\u201d says Meg Russell, director of the Constitution Unit at University College London.\n\nScotland\u2019s most senior judge, Lord Carloway, speaks at a court in Edinburgh, Scotland, on Wednesday in this still image from a video. The court ruled against the government. Photo: /Associated Press\n\nMs. Russell expects that once the dust settles on Brexit, the U.K. will have to codify several conventions into law. However, she says it is unlikely that Britain will ever have a \u201cWe the People\u201d constitution as in the U.S., because the U.K. is made up of a union of several nations each with its own identity.\n\nThe court has already intervened decisively in one Brexit dispute. In 2016, British businesswoman Gina Miller and hairdresser Deir Dos Santos launched a successful legal campaign to force the government to submit any Brexit deal it negotiated with the EU to Parliament for ratification. Parliament has rejected the deal negotiated by Mrs. May three times, leading to the postponement of Brexit, which was originally planned for March 29 and is now scheduled for Oct. 31.\n\nAnother factor that has heightened the constitutional tension in the crisis is that lawmakers have over the years tacked on laws that have changed tradition. Up to a decade ago, a government in Mr. Johnson\u2019s position\u2014in a minority of 45, thanks to the sacking last week of a bunch of Conservative lawmakers who voted against the government\u2014would be able to instantly throw in the towel and call an election.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Has the U.K. court system been compromised to play politics? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nBut now it can\u2019t. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act of 2011 took away the government\u2019s right to decide the timing of an election and put it in the hands of the Commons. So, for now, a government that can\u2019t legislate limps on.\n\nA further tension comes from the referendum itself. As exercises in direct democracy, referendums conflict with the principle of parliamentary sovereignty and the tradition of representative government. Members of Parliament see themselves as elected to interpret the best interests of their voters, not delegates who merely reflect their voters\u2019 views.\n\nNot everyone believes Britain\u2019s constitution needs to change.\n\n\u201cI know we are fighting like dogs in Parliament,\u201d says Stephen Tierney a legal adviser to the House of Lords Constitution Committee. \u201cBut I would much rather have these decisions made by someone I voted for rather than someone who just walked out of Harvard Law School.\u201d\n\nRelated Video \u201cOperation Yellow Hammer,\u201d a previously confidential U.K. government document outlining what might happen in case of a no-deal Brexit, describes shortages of fuel and medicines, chaos at the border, and increased food prices.\n\nWrite to Stephen Fidler at stephen.fidler@wsj.com and Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com", "description": "As the U.K.\u2019s highest court wades in to settle a tussle between the prime minister and lawmakers, some are questioning whether some conventions need changing.", "authors": ["Stephen Fidler", "Max Colchester", "Stephen.Fidler Wsj.Com", "Max.Colchester Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106601/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
