She was fitted with a collar containing a transponder to track her movements.\n\nShe was joined in August 2018 by a male companion, named August.\n\nShe has not been spotted since May, when she was captured for the last time by one of a network of night-vision cameras operated by the nature agency ANB.\n\nSince then, there has been no sign of her or the cubs she had been carrying, and the batteries in her tracking collar have run down.\n\nIt was \u201cvirtually certain\u201d she has been killed, possibly along with the pups, ANB said.\n\nAugust, who initially was seen taking food to Naya \u201caround the end of May, early June ... was now acting like a solitary wolf\u201d, ANB\u2019s spokeswoman Marie-Laure Vanwanseele told AFP.\n\nThe Belgian office of WWF said in a statement: \u201cThe death of the wolf and her pups is a shame for Belgium.\u201d\n\nPioneering wolf becomes first sighted in Belgium for a century Read more\n\nThree other wolves have been seen over the past 18 months roaming in and out of the country along forested areas bordering the Netherlands or Germany, according to ANB.\n\nThese include August, who was recorded on a camera last weekend.\n\nWhile suspicions over Naya\u2019s fate have fallen on illegal hunters, including a pair stopped after being spotted by a drone in the prohibited area around the wolves, there was \u201cno proof\u201d, Vanwanseele said.\n\nA local bird protection association has offered a reward of \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,900) for information identifying the suspected killers of Naya.\n\nHer disappearance has also alarmed an animal protection society in the Netherlands, which said three of the 16 wolves seen in that country over the past four years also cannot be found.", "description": "There has been no sign of Naya or the pups she was carrying since May", "authors": ["Afp In Brussels"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f02bb49224d9a94699b75213664bf898617c062/0_288_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e1682c3d729be8e820573b58d51f7e7c"}
