The new campaign is meant to respond to the #MeToo movement, with copy like \u201cby her, for her.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, Victoria\u2019s Secret has not been a brand for any women, really, despite its conspicuous practice of hiring models who conform to traditional Western beauty standards. This worked for a long time. The company, founded in 1977, was extremely successful for decades, but recently a spate of bad publicity and possibly related dips in sales has prompted some soul-searching, I suppose.\n\nRecent blunders include former marketing chief Edward Razek (he resigned last month after a 30-year tenure at the chain) saying in an interview with Vogue last year that he didn\u2019t think transgender models should walk in Victoria\u2019s Secret fashion shows, which are meant to present \u201ca fantasy.\u201d Over the summer it was revealed that the CEO of the lingerie brand\u2019s parent company, Leslie Wexner, had close ties with the wealthy pedophile and abuser Jeffrey Epstein. Wexner hired Epstein as his financial adviser in 1997. A New York Times article from 1996 described Epstein as Wexner\u2019s \u201cprot\u00e9g\u00e9.\u201d Epstein allegedly used his relationship with Wexner to pose as a model recruiter \u2014 a fraudulent role he very likely exploited.\n\nLast month, Pink hired Valentina Sampaio, the company\u2019s first transgender model. That same week a group of more than 100 models signed an open letter petitioning Victoria\u2019s Secret to take steps to protect models from sexual misconduct.", "description": "After months of bad publicity Victoria\u2019s Secret is rebranding to seem more inclusive and inspired by the #MeToo movement.", "authors": ["Hannah Gold"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/11/11-victorias-secret.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
