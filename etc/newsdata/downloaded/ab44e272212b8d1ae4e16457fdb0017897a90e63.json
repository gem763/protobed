The company is scheduled to release its third-quarter report on October 18.\n\nNetflix has plunged nearly 25% since July after its second-quarter report showed the service gaining 2.7 million subscribers, well below Wall Street's forecast of 5 million. The company also lost 126,000 US subscribers during the period \u2014 its first contraction since 2011.\n\nGoldman expects the company to report subscriber growth \"modestly below guidance\" in its upcoming report.\n\nHowever, Netflix is on its way to \"a stronger seasonal period for subscriber growth\" driven by a bolstered content lineup, analyst Heath Terry wrote.\n\nThe \"unprecedented\" fourth-quarter slate \u2014 including Martin Scorsese's \"The Irishman\" and the third season of \"The Crown\" \u2014 could shield Netflix from increased competition and create new subscriber growth among TV customers, the analyst said.\n\nRead more: An expert who studies venture capital says the WeWork 'smackdown' won't change the way the industry works \u2014 but he's telling investors how they can avoid the same mistake\n\n\"We continue to believe that traditional television (broadcast, basic/premium cable) creates the largest opportunity for Netflix, and streaming in general, to take share,\" Terry wrote.\n\nGoldman lowered its Netflix price target to $360 per share from $420 Thursday, but reiterated its \"buy\" rating.\n\nUBS analyst Eric Sheridan said investors \"have grown fearful\" the company will report disappointing subscriber figures again. The bank projects the third quarter will bring strong US subscriber trends, but revised its international growth target lower, citing \"weakness in key mature markets\" like Brazil and the UK.\n\nWhile the short-term \"will likely remain volatile,\" Netflix is likely to reach solid growth before other streaming services enter the fray, Sheridan said.\n\nUBS dropped its price target to $370 from $420 Wednesday and reiterated its \"buy\" rating.\n\nNetflix traded at $275.90 at 11:45 a.m. ET Thursday, up 3% year-to-date.\n\nThe company has 31 \"buy\" ratings, 10 \"hold\" ratings, and four \"sell\" ratings from analysts, with a consensus price target of $367.80, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nOnce-toxic Greek debt is now in high demand as global recession fears mount\n\nLuxury stocks are soaring after Louis Vuitton beats sales forecasts despite Hong Kong protests\n\n\n\nA doctor's office that charges $150 a month and doesn't take insurance just raised $26 million to take its model national", "description": "Netflix has much to prove in its upcoming third-quarter earnings report as it looks to impress investors before facing increased competition.
