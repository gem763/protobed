Don\u2019t go by ticket price alone", "language": "en", "text": "When booking a flight to a city with more than one airport, how do you know which one to choose? If you\u2019re like a majority of Americans, you\u2019re guided in part by your wallet.\n\nMore than 7 in 10 U.S. airline passengers (72%) say ticket price is a key deciding factor when choosing an airport to fly into or from, according to a 2019 survey commissioned by NerdWallet and conducted online by The Harris Poll among more than 1,800 U.S. adults who have ever flown on an airplane.\n\nBut travel experts suggest you shouldn\u2019t decide based on ticket price alone. Before locking in a reservation, here are other factors to consider.\n\nAvailability of direct routes\n\nCompare a direct flight against one with a layover. The latter might save you money, but cost you in comfort and convenience as you squeeze into a puddle-jumper and have to gate-check your carry-on.\n\n\u201cLiving on the West coast of Michigan, we have a lot of choices of airports,\u201d says Heather Houtman, a travel adviser and owner of Winsome Travel Design in Holland, Michigan, via email. Airports in Houtman\u2019s region include Gerald R. Ford International in Grand Rapids, Capital Region International in Lansing, Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County, and Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International and Midway International.\n\n\u201cWhat we consider is availability of direct flights, times of departures and arrivals, and least of all is price.\u201d\n\nOn-time record\n\nWhen you have choices among airports, one may be cheaper or more convenient to fly into \u2014 but what will it cost you in time? Some airports are notorious for late departures, \u201cground stops\u201d that delay all arrivals, or both. The Bureau of Transportation lets you search on-time statistics by flight number.\n\nRelated: Travelers rank the best hotels in the world, and there are plenty of surprises\n\nFor example, the 9:15 p.m. JetBlue JBLU, +1.25% flight from New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, might be more convenient to your hotel than flights from LaGuardia to, say, Palm Beach International. But per Bureau of Transportation statistics, among flights with delayed arrivals of more than 30 minutes, that LaGuardia-to-Fort-Lauderdale route was the most consistently delayed flight in the U.S. in June 2019.\n\nSecurity checkpoint wait times\n\nIf you\u2019re on a tight schedule, the amount of time you\u2019ll spend standing in security lines counts. Fortunately, there are tools that can help.\n\nSay you\u2019re flying out of Chicago and have a choice between O\u2019Hare and Midway. You can download the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s MyTSA app and see which one tends to have the shorter security line wait time for your travel window.\n\nKeep in mind, too, that having Global Entry or TSA PreCheck can help expedite the airport security process.\n\nGetting to and from the airport\n\nEven if you\u2019re saving upfront on your ticket, factor in the expense and ease of getting from the airport to where you need to be. An airport a bit farther from the city center might cost less to fly to, but you may end up spending more time and money to get to your final destination.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Here is the world\u2019s shortest (1.5 minutes) and longest (19.5 hours) commercial flight\n\nWhen traveling to Washington, D.C., \u201cI will always fly into Reagan over Dulles,\u201d says Melissa Terrio, who travels several months of the year for her job as director of graduate recruiting and admission at the Foisie Business School in Worcester, Massachusetts. \u201cBy the time you get from Dulles into D.C., it\u2019s more expensive in the end because there\u2019s limited public transportation \u2026 and a taxi can be cost-prohibitive.\u201d\n\nThe stress factor\n\nWhen you have a choice between arriving at a bustling hub or a smaller regional airport, the latter option can be less stressful, says Melita Siemak, a travel adviser and owner of Pacific Heights Travel in Manhattan Beach, California, via email.\n\nLarge airports can be overwhelming. Gates can be farther apart, lines can be longer, crowds can be bigger and louder.\n\n\u201cSometimes smaller makes it easier to get through the airport,\u201d Siemak says.\n\nAlso on MarketWatch: Science: The holidays are killing us\n\nSecond chances\n\nWhat if your flight gets canceled or overbooked? It can be less of a problem if your departure airport has multiple options to get you to your destination in time for a business meeting or a bedtime story.\n\nSomeone trying to get to Cleveland after missing their flight from New York\u2019s Kennedy Airport might be out of luck, as there may be only a handful of direct flights a day between JFK and Cleveland Hopkins International. But if you miss your flight from New York\u2019s LaGuardia, there often are more nonstop options to that Cleveland airport, increasing your chances of catching a later plane.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "Think beyond the upfront cost when making an airline reservation to or from an area with more than one airport.", "authors": ["Robin Saks Frankel"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT983_nerd_a_ZG_20191024165547.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
