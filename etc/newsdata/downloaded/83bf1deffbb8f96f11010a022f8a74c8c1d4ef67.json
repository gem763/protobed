A couple of fans even wore Winnie the Pooh costumes, which has become a way to mock Chinese president Xi Jingping\n\n'We want to use our performance art to show our support for Hong Kong and the NBA,' one spectator, 55-year-old Chen Pokong, told the New York Post.\n\n'[China wants] to take away freedom of speech and now spread dictatorship to America.\n\n'It seems like NBA people cannot choose their words. So if we don't stop them, they not only will do bad things in China, they will do bad things in America.'\n\nAccording to a Twitter thread from journalist Yashar Ali, the activists were brought to the game by Hollywood producer Andrew Duncan\n\n'Producer and activist Andrew Duncan bought 300 tickets to tonight's Nets vs Raptors game and is hosting hundreds of Chinese pro-Democracy activists to protest the NBA,' Ali tweeted.\n\nDuncan told the Post that he was upset after NBA star LeBron James criticized Morey for tweeting his support for the Hong Kong protests.\n\n'I don't want to get into a... feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand and he spoke,' James told reporters on Monday\n\nHe was met with intense backlash from NBA and non-NBA fans alike.\n\n'LeBron needs to take time on this issue,' Duncan said. 'Why is he not supporting democracy? I think the King has made a royal mistake.'\n\nAccording to the Post, the newspaper said the majority of protesters were natives of Hong Kong. The activists were mostly peaceful and none of them were banned or ejected from the arena.\n\nOne fan's sign was aimed at Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James, who was critical of Morey's tweet and called the executive was 'misinformed'.

I am sure he's a fine NBA general manager, and I will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been,' he wrote on October 6.\n\nBut the hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.'\n\nHowever, Nets guard Kyrie Irving said he understood why the protesters came to the game.\n\n'I think that when you think about communities across the world, I think that a lot of people would stand for world peace,' he said.\n\n'Government gets involved and impacts different communities in different ways. The reality is that as individuals it's our job to stand up for what we believe in.\n\n'I understand Hong Kong and China is dealing with their issues respectively, but there's enough oppression and stuff going on in America for me not to be involved in the community issues here as well.'", "description": "Hundreds of fans at the Brooklyn Nets' game at Barclays Center on Friday night wore black T-shirts that read 'Stand With Hong Kong' and held signs such as one that read: 'Human Rights Matter!'", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/05/19911840-0-image-a-22_1571460269367.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
