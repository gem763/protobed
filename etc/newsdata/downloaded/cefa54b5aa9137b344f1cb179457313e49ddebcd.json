I understand the depth of feeling in coal-producing communities in Australia and the wider economic imperatives at state and federal level.\n\n\u201cBut I also hope that we can eventually find more common ground in our vuvale [partnership] on the climate issue.\n\n\u201cBecause it is the greatest threat to our security in the Pacific and for my own people, and other Pacific Islanders, the impacts are really starting to bite.\n\n\u201cNot only extreme weather events like Winston but the rising seas and changes to agriculture and fisheries that threaten our food security and our livelihoods.\u201d\n\nBainimarama said that millions of Australians are also bearing the brunt of climate change, in recent bushfires, ongoing drought and severe water shortages.\n\nHe said the \u201csteady deterioration in the state of the only planet we have\u201d means that all nations need to be more ambitious in cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u201cWe must all unite behind the science and the IPCC report that calls for the average global temperature to be capped at 1.5C above that of the pre-industrial age.\u201d\n\nBainimarama called on Australia to \u201cjoin us in stepping up our collective response to the climate threat\u201d, including by putting the IPCC report back on the agenda at COP25 in Chile in December.\n\n'I don't know how we come back from this': Australia's big dry sucks life from once-proud towns Read more\n\n\u201cFiji and the other Pacific nations have already declared a crisis in our own region in the Kainaki II Declaration arising from last month\u2019s meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu.\n\n\u201cThis was the strongest declaration from the PIF on climate and we appreciate Australia\u2019s support as a signatory to the declaration.\u201d\n\nBainimarama suggested Australia could also help Fiji with renewable energy research, development and investment, reduce dependency on fossil fuels and increase carbon stocks through better management of landscapes and soils.\n\nGuardian Australia reported last week that Morrison will not attend the upcoming UN climate action summit despite him being in America to visit the Trump administration at the time \u2013 sending the foreign minister, Marise Payne, instead \u2013 because speaking slots were reserved for countries announcing new emissions reduction targets or financial commitments to the UN Green Climate Fund.\n\nOn Sunday Labor\u2019s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, recommitted to a target of net zero emissions by the middle of the century.\n\nHe warned the Coalition\u2019s target of 26% reduction by 2030 is \u201cunanimously regarded as grossly inadequate, [and is] consistent instead with more like 3C or 3.5C of global warming, which would be utterly catastrophic\u201d.", "description": "Frank Bainimarama wants the two countries to \u2018unite behind the science\u2019 of limiting global heating to 1.5C", "authors": ["Paul Karp"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c2acb1da7c650af4a5f3afa17103ccade4b88d/585_726_3455_2075/master/3455.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=87dea0e2b35fdbaef1d197753962bffe", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
