The offer still stands for a Brexit alliance [at the election].\u201d\n\nThe offer comes as Prime Minister Johnson attempts to get MPs to agree to hold a snap election which he hopes will clear Parliament of Brexit-obstructing lawmakers. The UK was due to leave the EU on October 31st, but the Benn Act forced the prime minister to obtain an extension to January 31st.\n\nIf the PM wants to fight a general election on defending a new EU treaty, that is very disappointing for all Leavers. His new agreement is just not Brexit. \u2014 Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) October 28, 2019\n\nParty leader Nigel Farage told MailOnline on Tuesday that he had not ruled out a Brexit Party-Conservative tactical voting pact, saying: \u201cWe will see what happens. I am not ruling anything in, not ruling anything out. But it would appear he wants to fight the election on the basis of that treaty which I just don\u2019t think is Brexit. But that may change.\u201d\n\nMr Farage maintains that a pact \u2014 where parties agree to tactically field candidates in swing seats to avoid a Brexit vote split which would hand victory to a Remain party \u2014 is dependant upon Mr Johnson abandoning the exit deal and embracing a clean break. Otherwise, the Brexit Party will challenge the Tories even in marginal seats. Mr Farage told MailOnline that whether that remains the case will be decided after party discussions \u201cover the next couple of days\u201d.\n\nHe said, however, that voters will have a \u201cseries of choices\u201d to make on election day.\n\n\u201cThey can vote for a party that wants to revoke, they can vote for a party that wants to have a second referendum, they can vote for a party that wants a new EU treaty, or they can vote for a party which wants a clean break,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News on Tuesday afternoon, Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib said: \u201cThe Conservatives have had three and a half years to deliver Brexit. They clearly can\u2019t do it on their own.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Conservatives should take great heed to Richard Tice\u2019s very generous offer to work with the Conservatives to make sure we get a majority Leave government, and we get a proper clean-break Brexit.\u201d\n\nThe government got these negotiations wrong from the start. We need a clean break first. That gives us the leverage we need to get a simple, straightforward trade deal. No need for the pitfalls and traps in Boris' deal! pic.twitter.com/Aat25AacEH \u2014 Richard Tice (@TiceRichard) October 27, 2019\n\nBrexit Party Chairman Richard Tice told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Tuesday morning: \u201cThere is no question that [Boris Johnson] has been trying but the Conservatives have failed three times to deliver Brexit and they clearly need our help.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have made a generous offer to the PM, that if you stand for a clean break Brexit, we will stand down and not fight with your candidates. We would rather have a leave alliance that will deliver a thumping victory,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s office had previously rejected offers of an election pact, with a Downing Street spokesman saying Mr Farage was not a \u201cfit and proper\u201d person to be allowed near government.\n\nWhile Tory Brexiteers in the past have suggested that their party needs an alliance with the Brexit Party, they appear to be rallying around the Conservatives going it alone. Andrew Bridgen, who told Breitbart London in June that the Tories may need an alliance with \u201ckingmaker\u201d Farage, said last week on BBC Newsnight that \u201cI think we don\u2019t need actually Nigel Farage, we only need his voters.\u201d\n\nSenior Brexiteer Steve Baker, who said last month that the prime minister should reconsider a deal with Farage, told the Huffington Post on Tuesday: \u201cA pre-Brexit pact with the Brexit Party won\u2019t happen all the time Nigel Farage insists the Conservatives pursue no deal, which won\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cBoris will have to win without any arrangement.\u201d", "description": "The Brexit Party is still reportedly open to an alliance with the Tories if Prime Minister Johnson backs a clean-break Brexit.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Nigel-Farage-2-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
