But last week\u2019s attack on a synagogue in the German city of Halle is a painful reminder that across Europe, anti-Semitism is alive and well.\n\nDespite being fortified (as is now common for synagogues, Jewish schools and even cemeteries across the continent) the gunman managed to kill two innocent Jews. German authorities have, as expected, promised to increase security in the aftermath of the attack. But that will do little to stop this hatred which, rather than fading in the face of modern European multiculturalism, is in fact emboldened by it - including by some of our mainstream politicians.\n\nWhen carefully coded Jew hatred is allowed to permeate public life, is it any surprise that many Jews, like me, choose to push our identity deeper into our private lives and away from the limelight? All too often we only discuss anti-Semitism when it is undeniable and violent, for example after the recent attack in Halle. Although the culprit appears to be a Far-Right extremist, some were quick to circulate fake news that the attack was carried out by a Syrian refugee resident in Germany. It is this kind of speculation and suspicion of the \u201cofficial story\u201d that can tell us so much about the rise of anti-Semitism in the last few years, which is intimately connected to conspiracy theories about elites and media control.\n\nHatred towards Jews, it seems, has been lost in the mix. Visibility is key to the problem. Something rarely spoken about - both in the media and in private conversations - is that, unlike people of colour for example, Jews often have the option to hide their Judaism. Mike Bernstein Human rights campaigner\n\nGiven the current populist mood across the political spectrum, anti-Semitic ideas can be easily dressed up as anti-establishment or anti-capitalist campaigns. The assumption that Jews like me are secretly in control of the capitalist establishment is almost always left unsaid. But unsaid is not the same as unheard.\n\nThis is not a fringe problem, confined to online alt-rightists or Islamist extremists. It could be argued that some of the continent\u2019s biggest political parties - on both the right and the left - are complicit in Jew hatred to the point of being institutionally anti-Semitic. Most infamous at the moment is the UK\u2019s Labour Party, which until recently I supported. Its leader, Jeremy Corbyn has developed a personality cult based on a cadre of hard left activists, many of whom were not even members of the party until his takeover.\n\nAs well as referring to Hamas and Hezbollah as his \u201cfriends\u201d, Corbyn has overseen a climate of persecution against many Jewish parliamentarians, which has given MPs like Luciana Berger, and just this week Dame Louise Ellmann, no other recourse but to resign from the party. This has trickled down to grassroots supporters like myself, with me being regularly challenged to \u201cprove\u201d my loyalty, not only to the party but the country.\n\nOfficially, Labour has, of course disavowed this. Corbyn has regularly stated that he condemns \u201canti-Semitism and other forms of racism.\u201d The wording of this carefully choreographed mantra can tell us a lot about modern anti-Semitism. It would sound absurd if a potential British prime minister condemned \u201cviolence against women and other acts of aggression against other genders\u201d or \u201cterrorism and other crimes.\u201d The issues of violence against women and terrorism are rightly seen as serious enough to deserve their own dedicated condemnation. We would never ask them to share space with other, albeit related, issues.\n\nHatred towards Jews, it seems, has been lost in the mix. Visibility is key to the problem. Something rarely spoken about - both in the media and in private conversations - is that, unlike people of colour for example, Jews often have the option to hide their Judaism. Given recent events, many of them, like me, choose to conceal - or at least selectively reveal - their heritage. Just as Jews have become hidden, the animosity towards us has become easier to camouflage and deny.\n\nThat is, when denial is even necessary. When Conservatives like Priti Patel or Jacob Rees-Mogg talk of the \u201cilluminati\u201d or \u201cmetropolitan North London elites\u201d many of their supporters will know at some level that they are talking about Jews. The language is so indirect, however, that the culprits can carry on doing business without even denying the implicit meaning of their words. Things are even more grim - and far less subtle - on the left.\n\nFor example, Salma Yaqoob, a friend of Corbyn, was recently re-admitted to the party despite ruthlessly attacking it until a few months ago, including a hate-filled campaign against Labour MP Naz Shah where Yaqoob\u2019s campaign shamed her opponent for not wearing a hijab, and her campaigners even compared Shah to a dog.\n\nLess well-known, however, is that Yaqoob\u2019s supporters verbally attacked Shah at a campaign event. Their insult of choice? \u201cJew.\u201d Yaqoob looked on, didn\u2019t ask them to stop, and hasn\u2019t clarified whether she agrees that \u201cJew\u201d is indeed an insult.\n\nPerhaps tired of being ignored by Corbyn, Jewish community leaders like the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council didn\u2019t even ask him to respond. As Jewish individuals like me have started to become invisible, our community advocates have also started to retreat from public engagement.\n\nIf those who could potentially be a prime minister-in-waiting indulge anti-Semitism with political impunity, it will take much more than a security guard at the synagogue door to stop Europe\u2019s new wave of anti-Semitism.\n\nMike Bernstein is a British human rights campaigner\n\n____________\n\nAre you a recognised expert in your field?
