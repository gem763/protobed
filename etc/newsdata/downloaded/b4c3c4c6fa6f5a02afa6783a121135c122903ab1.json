About 16% of the patients with lung injuries have been under age 18. The U.S. Surgeon General has called teen vaping an epidemic, and the secretary of Health and Human Services warned that the government has never before seen such a rapid uptick in the use of a substance by kids.\n\nIt\u2019s scary stuff for parents, who may have steeled themselves to talk to their children about drinking, drugs and peer pressure, but not necessarily about a product that didn\u2019t exist when they were kids. Here are some basics.\n\n1. Start young. Think age 9.\n\n\u201cThe evidence shows that we really need to be talking about vaping \u2015 and about substance use in general \u2015 well before many parents realize they should,\u201d said Margie Skeer, a professor of public health and community medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cResearch shows us that age 9 is the time when we want to start having these conversations in a developmentally appropriate way,\u201d she added. Yes, with your third or fourth grader.\n\nWhat does \u201cdevelopmentally appropriate\u201d mean? It means you should break down your warning into simple concepts the child can grasp: Explain that nicotine is a chemical that goes into your body and tells your brain that you need it. It makes you lose your sense of control. Skeer suggests that imagery can help. Kids understand that a stoplight cycles from green to yellow to red, so explain that vaping messes with those signals, keeping your brain\u2019s stoplight stuck on green. It\u2019s telling your body go, go, go or more, more, more.\n\n\u201cWe really need to be talking about vaping \u2015 and about substance use in general \u2015 well before many parents realize they should.\u201d - Margie Skeer, a professor at Tufts University School of Medicine\n\nIt\u2019s important to start having these conversations early because kids try substances at startlingly young ages. In a 2013 survey, about 5.4 million youth ages 12 to 20 reported binge drinking in the past month. If you wait to talk to your children when they\u2019re in middle school, you might be too late.\n\nSkeer emphasizes that it is also about setting expectations while you still have a fair amount of influence.\n\n\u201cWhen your children are younger, you\u2019re the most important person in their lives,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the time they\u2019re teens, that begins to shift and their peers become more important. When you still have their attention, it\u2019s important that you\u2019re leading the conversations.\u201d\n\n2. Know some basic facts, and be honest when you don\u2019t.\n\nBecause vaping is relatively new (e-cigarettes really only hit the market in the United States about a decade ago), many parents don\u2019t have a lot of information. Given that they were originally sold as a way of kicking the tobacco habit, people who didn\u2019t smoke may have paid the product little attention. Now, public perception is shifting. More people recognize the potential harms of vaping \u2014 but there is still a lot of confusion.\n\n\u201cParents need to be credible when they talk to their kids about this,\u201d Skeer said.\n\nBefore you start any conversation, make sure you know some basics: Yes, vaping is bad for your health. And yes, it is addictive. If your child asks you a question you don\u2019t know the answer to, admit that and then spend some time together looking it up.\n\n3. Open the lines of communication directly and indirectly.\n\nSome parents might think that fear and punishment are their best tools when it comes to keeping kiddos away from e-cigarettes, but experts believe that\u2019s not the case. \u201cI think the most important thing is to have an open, ongoing conversation,\u201d said Dr. Indra Cidambi, medical director of the Center for Network Therapy, an outpatient detoxification program in New Jersey.\n\nCidambi recommends taking direct steps such as making sure your family sits down for at least one meal together a day and using that time to talk about vaping. Ask your children what they know about it, whether they\u2019ve seen kids doing it and what questions they have. Parents are often surprised, she said, by how curious their children are about substances and how open they can be to such conversations.\n\n\u201cGo out of your way to tell them stories about the mistakes you made when you were younger ... and explain that you still make mistakes every day.\u201d\n\nFoster a broader sense of openness as well by making it clear to your kids that they can always come and talk to you about tough things. Again, start young. Cidambi offers the example of a child who scratches the family iPad and waits to tell you because they\u2019re worried about your reaction. Make it clear that what bothers you isn\u2019t the accident; it\u2019s the fact that they felt like they couldn\u2019t come to you.\n\nAnd hammer home that lesson every chance you get. Go out of your way to tell them stories about the mistakes you made when you were younger, Cidambi urges, and explain that you still make mistakes every day.\n\n\u201cIf they feel they cannot confide in at least one parent,\u201d Cidambi said, \u201cyou are at a loss.\u201d\n\n4. Help them practice their responses.\n\nThis might be a new one to parents raised in the era of \u201cJust Say No\u201d (which was a pretty resounding failure, for what it\u2019s worth), but experts say it is important to work with kids on how they\u2019ll respond when they inevitably come face-to-face with e-cigarettes or other substances.\n\nSkeer likens it to helping your kids with algebra. You wouldn\u2019t just talk broadly about algebra as a concept, and then think they\u2019ll somehow develop the skills to actually do their homework. Similarly, talking to your kids about vaping isn\u2019t enough. You have to teach them the skills they need to handle peer pressure in the moment. Heck, even sober adults can struggle with how to respond in social settings.\n\nSo help your children make a list of things they can say that feel comfortable and natural to them.\n\n\u201cIt could be, \u2018I have soccer tomorrow,\u2019\u201d Skeer said. \u201cOr \u2018My parents would kill me.\u2019 Or even \u2018No, thanks.\u2019\u201d", "description": "As lung injuries rise, here's how parents can help keep their children safe and informed about e-cigarettes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9e2659210000b908acbe94.jpeg?cache=LbZPqdVLBP&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
