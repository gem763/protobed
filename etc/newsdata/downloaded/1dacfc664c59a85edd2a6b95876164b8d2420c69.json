Rather than use their opponent\u2019s moment of weakness as an advantage, members of Shabab al Ordon paused playing and gathered around her so as to protect her head from being seen.\n\nA video of the powerful moment was shared on Twitter by @ItsSlyG and has received nearly 4 million views.\n\nShe was wearing a Hijab and the opponents huddled around to make sure that her hair's not seen.

But for many women who practice Islam, covering their heads with a hijab is of utmost importance.\n\nWhat happens if her hair is seen? I know the general gist of Islam, but not all the ins and outs. \u2014 A spooky skeleton is inside you!\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\ude08 (@JonesCT) October 17, 2019\n\nWhat's the relation of hijab, muslim gurls, and their hair? Pls enlighten me, i'm a non-muslim guy. \u2014 Raf (@YanDare_) October 16, 2019\n\nMany members of the faith say that they wear the hijab as a symbol of their devotion to their faith. Some have also worn it as an act of resistance against European colonizers in the past, or as a symbol of pride in their identity.\n\nThis is the definition of respect... You don't have to like or understand, just do it... \u2014 #xpensivity (@xpensivity) October 17, 2019\n\nRegardless of why it\u2019s worn, the fact that her opponents came to her aid shows a level of sportsmanship rarely seen. And really, don\u2019t we need more of this in the world?\n\nwe need more people like this in the world \ud83d\udc9c \u2014 Ember Byrd (@emberbyrdxo) October 16, 2019\n\nOh, and for those interested: The Shabab al Ordon players of Jordan who came to the rescue won this tournament. But let\u2019s be real, was there ever a question that they were winners after the way they acted?\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Nearly 4 million people have watched this act of kindness.", "authors": ["Priscilla Blossom"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iBkF7jlFTXcXobb2SsLtiw--~B/aD0yMzMzO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/967b8310-f12d-11e9-bf79-7b84b5263ef1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
