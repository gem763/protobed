There is a meeting at Rockefeller institute on State st, where he sits on a panel. It starts at 10am.\"\n\nFlynn then asked for responses from the ward leaders. \"If you don\u2019t respond,\" he wrote, \"I am taking you off of any further emails as there are many who never respond which I consider very inappropriate as a ward leader/town chair.\u201d\n\nThe apparent drive to drum up opposition to fusion voting comes as the topic has overtaken much of the public debate over the commission\u2019s work and will do little to tamp down the suspicions of critics who believe the commission is out to kill the practice.\n\nOne county committee member said they were subsequently approached by their local leader about the public hearing. Another received an email from their local leader on Tuesday. It read: \u201cThe State Chair of the Democratic Party, Jay Jacobs, has contacted our County Chair, Jack Flynn and requested that committee members speak against fusion voting.\"\n\nFlynn did not respond to a request for comment late Tuesday afternoon.\n\nJacobs is from Long Island, where the ties between fusion and patronage have led to more widespread criticism than in other parts of the state. Jacobs has opposed the practice in the past, although after being appointed to the commission by Gov. Andrew Cuomo, he said he would approach the subject with \u201can open mind.\"\n\nAsked about the emails, Jacobs said he had been contacted by \u201ca couple of chairs\u201d who were interested in attending. Since \u201cthe folks who have been in favor of fusion voting have been there,\u201d he said he encouraged them to participate.\n\n\u201cI certainly would encourage anybody that shows up to speak their mind,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of people who are opposed to fusion voting \u2026 If that\u2019s the way it is, don\u2019t keep it a secret. We need a full and open discussion of the issues.\u201d\n\nAt a public hearing in Manhattan last Tuesday, the Working Families Party and its supporters brought scores of individuals who used some of the three minutes they were allotted to telling the commissioners to keep their hands off fusion. They recruited so many backers that the room was filled to capacity, forcing many attendees to watch on a television screen set up in the hallway. The hearing went on for nearly four hours, with only a scattered few attendees speaking against the practice.\n\nThe WFP and other groups have similarly been working to drum up attendance for Wednesday's meeting, which will be held in much smaller rooms utilized by the Rockefeller Institute.", "description": "The move won't tamp down suspicions about the commission's work.", "authors": ["Bill Mahoney"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/capny/sites/default/files/a%20-%20skyline_3.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
