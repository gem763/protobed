Kamala D. Harris plans to cut campaign staff at her Baltimore headquarters and shift resources to Iowa as she looks to rescue her flagging presidential campaign with just months to go until the first-in-the-nation caucuses.\n\nThe campaign restructuring involves layoffs or redeployments both in Baltimore and in such other early-voting states as New Hampshire and Nevada, and her home state of California.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning of this campaign, Kamala Harris and this team set out with one goal \u2014 to win the nomination and defeat Donald Trump in 2020,\u201d campaign manager Juan Rodriguez wrote in a memo. \u201cThis requires us to make difficult strategic decisions and make clear priorities, not threaten to drop out or deploy gimmicks.\u201d\n\nMr. Rodriguez plans to take a pay cut as part of the changes, which are not expected to affect staffing in South Carolina, site of the first-in-the-South primary.\n\nThe Harris campaign pointed to John Kerry in 2004 and John McCain in 2008 as examples of candidates who ultimately secured their party\u2019s presidential nomination after making \u201ctough choices.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cgimmicks\u201d Mr. Rodriguez cited likely referred to such 2020 rivals as Sen. Cory A. Booker of New Jersey and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro, both of whom have threatened to end their campaigns in recent weeks if they didn\u2019t meet certain fundraising goals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly never a good sign, but it\u2019s not fatal \u2014 yet,\u201d said John Couvillon, a Louisiana-based pollster.\n\n\u201cWhat I think it signifies is that she\u2019s circling the wagons,\u201d Mr. Couvillon said. \u201cWhile it\u2019s certainly not a \u2018circling the drains\u2019 kind of thing yet, it does signify that the initial lofty expectations of her campaign have not been realized because, of course, she has quite a bit of competition on the progressive side.\u201d\n\nThe Harris campaign shake-up was first reported by Politico on Wednesday.\n\nMs. Harris finished the most recent fundraising quarter with about $10.5 million on hand.\n\nBut she raised about $11.8 million while spending close to $14.6 million, and has been slipping in recent polling while such candidates as Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, have gained momentum in recent weeks.\n\nThe campaign of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, who finished the quarter with less than $9 million on hand, has signaled in recent days that it wouldn\u2019t oppose outside help from a super PAC to try to boost Mr. Biden, who has also lost ground in some recent polling.\n\nMs. Harris was at 3% support in a national USA Today/Suffolk University poll released Wednesday.\n\nLast month, the campaign had already announced an \u201cIowa-or-bust\u201d campaign strategy couched in a top-three finish in the Hawkeye State.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those unfortunate realities that due to the sequencing of the primary calendar, you basically have to put the majority of your eggs in either Iowa or New Hampshire or both. Of course you can never admit that publicly, but that\u2019s the reality,\u201d Mr. Couvillon said.\n\nThe announcement came as Ms. Harris and other 2020 Democratic presidential contenders are set to head to Iowa this weekend for the state Democratic Party\u2019s \u201cLiberty and Justice Celebration,\u201d one of the premier political events of the year.\n\nThe Harris campaign said in a separate memo Wednesday that the senator has \u201cmoved to Iowa\u201d in the run-up to the event, spending 15 days at more than 30 different events across the state.\n\nA reporter overheard Ms. Harris joke to a colleague last month, \u201cI\u2019m [expletive] moving to Iowa\u201d \u2014 a phrase that now adorns T-shirts and sweatshirts as clothing companies look to cash in on the unguarded moment.\n\n\u201cHeading into November, Harris will maintain frequent travel to Iowa and keep building out her on the ground organizing in every corner of the state,\u201d the campaign said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
