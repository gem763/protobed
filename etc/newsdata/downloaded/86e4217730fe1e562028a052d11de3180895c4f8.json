The only other known interstellar tourist was the object known as 'Oumuamua, which did not show any tail \u2013 a fact that continues to perplex astronomers to this day.\n\nThe picture was nearly missed, researchers said, but was the result of astronomers rushing to take the picture soon after the msterious object was identified.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

These so-called red giants then begin to lose their outer layers of material into space. More than half of such a star's mass can be shed in this manner, forming a shell of surrounding gas. At the same time, the star's core shrinks and grows hotter, emitting ultraviolet light that causes the expelled gases to glow. This type of object is called, somewhat confusingly, a planetary nebula, though it has nothing to do with planets. The name derives from the rounded, planet-like appearance of these objects in early telescopes\" - European Space Agency Nasa 2/10 Two galaxies are seen interacting with one another. This pair of galaxies is known as UGC2369 and they are being drawn together by mutual gravitational attraction.

The photo was taken soon after it was first seen, on the night of 9-10 September, by a telescope on Hawaii's Maunakea.\n\nTo take the images, researchers took observations in two different colour bands or filters and combined them into a colour image.\n\nFor now, it is difficult for researchers to see more of the comet, because it has moved near to the Sun and is therefore difficult to see. But it is expected to swing into a better position in the coming months, as it continues its mysterious journey around the solar system.", "description": "Scientists have revealed stunning images of the first comet from another solar system ever seen.
