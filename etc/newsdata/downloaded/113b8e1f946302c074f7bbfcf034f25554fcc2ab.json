The high-concentration cartridges deliver a bigger, faster hit of nicotine than was possible with traditional cigarettes. \u201cWhat Juul did was it perfected nicotine delivery,\u201d Dr. Levy said.\n\n\u201cMy sense, and there are not data to guide this yet, is that the more severe the nicotine use disorder, the more necessary to give medication,\u201d Dr. Hadland said. That includes nicotine replacement, with patches, and then lozenges or gum to deal with breakthrough cravings. It can also include a medication called Chantix, which can help with cravings, but has not been found to be effective for those 16 and under, and is generally used cautiously in older adolescents and younger adults. The antidepressant medication Wellbutrin is also sometimes used.\n\n\u201cNicotine replacement doesn\u2019t work as well as it does in adults, but it does increase the quit rate,\u201d Dr. Levy said. \u201cWe do a lot of coaching of our pediatric colleagues, we tell them go ahead and be generous,\u201d that is, for example, helping parents understand that because vaping can mean an adolescent is accustomed to a very high dose of nicotine, that kid may go through a lot of lozenges.\n\nAll of these medications are more effective with cognitive behavioral therapy to help you deal with your emotions and manage cravings, Dr. Levy said. Counseling is an important part of treatment, and one reason I try hard to refer my patients to specialty clinics is that I want them to have experienced counselors. And treatment is much more likely to be successful when there is support from a parent.\n\nBecause of the high nicotine concentrations and the physiological dependence, Dr. Hadland said, young people who are trying to quit vaping may experience symptoms that go well beyond the cravings that those who smoke traditional cigarettes experience when they try to quit. In addition to those very strong cravings, there may be general irritability, headaches or a sense of feeling sick to your stomach.", "description": "As vaping deaths rise, quitting has a new urgency.
