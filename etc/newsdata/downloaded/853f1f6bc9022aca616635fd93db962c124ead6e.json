It could also be a meteorite.\u201d\n\nAfter receiving meteor sightings from across the west of the UK, the UK Meteor Network said one was believed to have travelled southwesterly over the English Channel.\n\nBOAM (@BOAM_meteore) Rentr\u00e9e atmosph\u00e9rique #bolide du 08/09/2019 4:51:36 UTC (6:51:36 CEST) au dessus #Manche #English_Channel\n\nEnregistr\u00e9e par une camera BOAM \u00e0 #MaysurOrne #Calvados #Normandie par S.

It eventually broke off into two. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. Never seen anything like that before. I wish more people had seen it. It\u2019s the most amazing thing I\u2019ve seen.\u201d", "description": "Glowing object flying through the air led to land and air search in south-west England", "authors": ["Mattha Busby"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c46dbb280890abf7cad5bcdfe66ba34a15f8743/0_194_1296_778/master/1296.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4c28c8abbe7f1f19881ed8facd9864e5", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
