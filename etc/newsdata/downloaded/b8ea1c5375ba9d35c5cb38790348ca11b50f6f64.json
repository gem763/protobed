When investors see there is still growth in the business, then the political risk becomes the second or third [issue].\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that the economic story has been pretty impressive. The year-on-year growth rate has been above 4 per cent since the start of 2017.\n\nYou can feel it on the streets of central Warsaw, where shiny glass towers are springing from the derelict blocks of the communist period. One of them is aspiring to become the tallest skyscraper in Europe, topping out one metre higher than London\u2019s Shard.\n\nBuildings are shooting up in formerly derelict areas of Poland's capital Warsaw. Bloomberg\n\n\u201cThe Polish economy is changing so quickly, it\u2019s hard to get people to realise what\u2019s happening,\u201d says Tadeusz Koscinski, the England-born deputy finance minister.\n\nEU money has poured in, driving infrastructure and social development, to the tune of \u20ac104.8 billion ($169 billion) between 2014 and 2020. That is now drying up \u2013 the price of success, since Poland is generally considered a developed country \u2013 but foreign investors have been stepping in. The flow of foreign capital jumped 25 per cent in 2018 (admittedly off a pretty poor 2017).\n\nIn the past two or three years, Warsaw has sought to claim the mantle of central Europe\u2019s main hub, and banks have noticed. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Standard Chartered and Credit Suisse have opened decent-sized offices. More may follow, as the banks tend to move in a pack\u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a herd mentality\u201d, says Mike Kennedy, founder of Talent Alpha and a former Goldmans exec in Warsaw.\n\nThe capital\u2019s 1.7 million population turns out to be a reservoir of well-educated, English-speaking youth, where wages, although growing, are still relatively cheap. The real estate is also good value.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m looking at a 17,000 sq m negotiation, it\u2019ll be one-third the cost of \u2018old Europe\u2019,\u201d says Jedrzej Iwaszkiewicz, from the Heart Corporate Centre for Digital Ventures.\n\nWarsaw mayor Rafat Trzaskowski says many British companies in particular are \u201cknocking on our doors and saying 'can we do business here in Poland?'\u201d. Chartered accountants, banks \u2013 \u201cthis is not just back office, they want to have regional headquarters here\u201d.\n\nForeigners still welcome?\n\nBut it\u2019s not all rosy. PwC\u2019s chief economic adviser in Poland, Witold Orlowski, says Poland is at a crossroads.\n\nHe reckons investment is slowing down, and the nationalistic approach of the PiS isn\u2019t helping. The ruling party is responsible with the budget, he says, but are talking a big game about a state-led approach to future infrastructure investment, led by public-sector companies and excluding foreign participation.\n\nThis \"re-Polonisation\", as its known, would be disappointing news for the big Australian superannuation funds and Macquarie, who would doubtless like to replicate investments such as that at Gdansk Port.\n\nMacquarie, AustralianSuper, MTAA Super and Statewide Super sold the asset in June for more than $1.8 billion to a consortium including IFM Investors and also the state-owned Polish Development Fund.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe jewel in the infrastructure development crown is the proposed \u20ac17 billion Solidarity Transport Hub Poland, an airport 37 kilometres from Warsaw plus 1600 kilometres of new railway linking it to all parts of the country.\n\nThe state is developing it at the moment, and the Hub\u2019s acting president Piotr Malepszak says it's still too early to say if private investors will be invited in. If they were, it would be for the \u20ac7 billion airport component.\n\nBefore, anyone who wanted to come and invest was welcome. Now, we simply tell people what we want. \u2014 Warsaw mayor Rafat Trzaskowski\n\nBack in Warsaw, there\u2019s a second metro line under construction, funded by the EU. As the EU funds evaporate, though \u201cwe cannot build such infrastructure projects on our own\u201d, says mayor Trzaskowski.\n\nOrlowski, though, isn\u2019t sure how far the government will go.\n\n\u201cIf you listen to Polish state TV you will hear so many bad things about foreign investment. But if you listen to the Prime Minister talking to foreign investors in English, you\u2019ll hear about how Poland wants to welcome them,\u201d he says.\n\nKoscinski, the deputy finance minister, says his government wants foreign investors, but not at any price.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking for investors who will open a factory and create 1000 jobs \u2013 we have a very low unemployment rate. We\u2019re looking for investors to work with universities to do their R &D here in Poland, creating good quality jobs, build their supply chains here, and build production for exports.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarsaw mayor Trzaskowski agrees: \u201cBefore, anyone who wanted to come and invest was welcome. Now, we simply tell people what we want. And they know it, they adapt to it. We don\u2019t just want huge commercial centres, we want multi-function and we want our heritage to be protected.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Mateusz Moriawecki, an economist by training, has kept up the populist rhetoric of his predecessor, but tempered its edges.\n\nHe\u2019ll publicly push \u201cculture wars\u201d buttons \u2013 particularly on gay issues \u2013 when it suits him, but leaves the heavy lifting on that to the party\u2019s hardline leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski.\n\nJaroslaw Kaczynski, chairman of the Law & Justice party (PiS), arrives at an election rally. Bloomberg\n\nThe government\u2019s main stated priority during the election campaign hasn\u2019t been the longstanding push against Western European liberalism; rather, they\u2019ve focused on a plan to \u201crebalance the social model\u201d, by which they mean direct more public spending to their rural political base.\n\nEconomic pressures\n\nThis program includes more social spending, a higher minimum wage, and a lower retirement age. That may put pressure on a labour market already as tight as they come: unemployment is just 3.8 per cent, and the unskilled end of the market depends on heavy borrowing of labour from neighbouring Ukraine.\n\nWages are still relatively low, but there\u2019s the possibility inflation could break out of its holding pattern. It\u2019s already at 3 per cent. That would come just as a slowdown in Poland\u2019s most important export market, Germany, takes hold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrlowski\u2019s tipping growth of 2.6 per cent in 2020, down from 4 per cent this year, while inflation will spike to 4.6 per cent, up from 2.5 per cent this year.\n\nThis would make life interesting from Poland\u2019s central bank, which has kept the benchmark interest rate steady at 1.5 per cent. The bank's official view is that inflation will spike briefly before settling, and that the PiS plan to boost the minimum wage won\u2019t fuel price growth.\n\nThere's some context for this remarkably sanguine view: most of the central bank\u2019s board were appointed by the PiS, and the governor is a friend of party leader Kaczynski.\n\nStill, nothing to see here apparently. Poland last year made the top 40 chart of Transparency International\u2019s corruption perception index, outperforming Spain and Italy. And it\u2019s also in the top 30 of the World Bank\u2019s ease of doing business index.\n\nThe CEO of Poland\u2019s national airline LOT, Rafal Milczarski, tells journalists the country has made impressive strides in cutting red tape and stamping out corruption, including under the business-friendly PiS\n\n\u201cI am bewildered by the success of the current government,\u201d he says. \u201cToday the Polish economy is a completely different bowl of cereal.\u201d\n\nSo if you\u2019re an investor, bon appetit. But if you\u2019re a liberal voter or politician, this weekend you'll likely be crying into your cornflakes.\n\nThe writer travelled to Warsaw as a guest of Poland Today magazine.", "description": "The anti-liberal ruling party PiS is set for fresh election glory.
