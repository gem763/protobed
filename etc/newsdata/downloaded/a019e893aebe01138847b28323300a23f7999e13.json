(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nA day after missing the Washington Redskins\u2019 walk-through with a sprained foot that had him in a walking boot, quarterback Case Keenum fully practiced Thursday. He is expected to start Sunday at the New York Giants, barring any setbacks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s feeling better today,\u201d Keenum said of the injury. \u201cA short week. Was pretty sore after [Monday\u2019s] game. Wanted it to calm down, get the swelling out. Stabilize it. Just walking around, they put me in [the boot] for the day.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s practice also featured an unfamiliar sight \u2014 three players wearing the yellow quarterback jersey.\n\nThe team hasn\u2019t had its top three signal callers at practice since mid-August, when Colt McCoy was sidelined after a setback during his rehab from three surgeries to repair the broken leg he suffered against the Philadelphia Eagles in December. He returned for the walk-through Wednesday and was a full participant in Thursday\u2019s practice. McCoy was in the competition to win the starting job before complications from the injury began to affect his ability to plant on dropbacks.\n\n[Of Redskins\u2019 problems, their NFL-worst third down defense might be most glaring]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a few days or maybe weeks before he gets back in the flow with his timing and his feet and fundamentals and pocket,\u201d Coach Jay Gruden said of McCoy. \u201cHe\u2019s missed a lot of time. It was good to get him back out there, though, watch him zip it around and move around. He felt okay, just a matter of him getting comfortable with his feet and his legs.\u201d\n\nGruden said it\u2019s unlikely McCoy will be active for Sunday\u2019s game unless there\u2019s a setback to Keenum, who has started the team\u2019s first three games this season.\n\nCalls for Keenum\u2019s replacement began this week after he turned the ball over five times in a 31-15 loss to the Chicago Bears on Monday, with fans chanting during the game for the team, which is 0-3, to put in rookie first-round pick Dwayne Haskins. Several members of the media have said this week that Washington should start Haskins.\n\nKeenum said he suffered the foot sprain during a play on which he was sacked by the Bears.\n\nWhile Keenum is likely to play against the Giants, the team has other injury concerns. Center Chase Roullier (knee), guard Brandon Scherff (ankle) and tight end Jordan Reed (concussion) did not practice Thursday. Rookie wide receiver Terry McLaurin, one of the team\u2019s top performers this season, was limited with a hamstring issue Gruden said he hopes is not serious.\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nAfter a third lackluster loss, Redskins\u2019 defense has few answers for how to fix things\n\nJay Gruden doesn\u2019t think Redskins\u2019 season is over, so Dwayne Haskins will continue to wait", "description": "Keenum suffered a sprained foot versus Chicago.
