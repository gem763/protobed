Banks and many restaurants and shops remained closed.\n\nThe demonstrations first erupted on Thursday, sparked by a proposed 20 cent tax on calls via messaging apps such as WhatsApp.\n\nSuch calls are the main method of communication for many Lebanese and, despite the government's swift abandonment of the tax, the demonstrations quickly swelled into the largest in years.\n\nThe protesters are demanding a sweeping overhaul of Lebanon's political system, citing grievances ranging from austerity measures to alleged corruption to poor infrastructure.\n\nThousands of people of all ages, sects and political affiliations brought the capital to a standstill on Friday, with demonstrations reported across the country.\n\nMinor clashes continued through the night pitting groups of young men against the army, an AFP reporter said.\n\nOne protester in the southern city of Nabatieh, a Hezbollah stronghold, vowed to defy the crackdown.\n\n\"They are trying to portray us as a mob, but we are demanding our rights,\" he told a local television channel.\n\n\"We are used to repression.\"\n\nLebanon has one of the highest public debt burdens in the world and the government is trying to reach agreement on a package of belt-tightening measures to cap the deficit in next year's budget.\n\nThe promised austerity moves are essential if Lebanon is to unlock $11 billion in economic assistance pledged by international donors last year.", "description": "The Lebanese army moved to end a wave of protests against tax increases and alleged official corruption Saturday as the fragile governing coalition fractured over promised economic reforms.
