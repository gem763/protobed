'But I still allowed it to happen despite my better judgment,' she wrote. 'For that I apologize.' Pictured: Hill with her staffers\n\n\u2018It pains me deeply that I have to send you this note at all,\u2019 she wrote in the letter addressed to \u2018family, friends, supporters and members of my community.\u2019\n\n\u2018But I want you to hear from me so that I can hopefully put to rest some of the gossip, innuendo and lies that have been told in recent days.\n\nDuring the final tumultuous years of my abusive marriage, I became involved in a relationship with someone on my campaign.

I know that even a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate, but I still allowed it to happen despite my better judgment. For that I apologize.\u2019\n\nHill said she wishes \u2018nothing but the best\u2019 for the campaign worker, whom she did not identify.\n\nDailyMail.com knows the identity of the woman, who is now 24, but is not revealing it as she may be the victim of sexual abuse.\n\nWhen approached on Tuesday at her home in Hill\u2019s constituency, the woman said: \u2018No comment, please leave. Leave now.\u2019\n\nHill\u2019s letter came within 10 minutes of the House Ethics Committee announcing it would open an investigation into her conduct. \u2018I am fully and proactively cooperating with the Ethics Committee,\u2019 she said.\n\nCommittee chairman, Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch of Florida and vice-chairman Republican Rep. Kenny Marchant of Texas said in a statement: \u2018The committee is aware of public allegations that Representative Katie Hill may have engaged in a sexual relationship with an individual on her congressional staff, in violation of House Rule XXIII, clause 18 (a).\n\nHill was also accused of having a separate affair with her male legislative affairs officer, Graham Kelly (pictured together)\n\nAccording to text messages seen by DailyMail.com, Hill's relationship with Kelly (pictured together) was the final straw for Heslep, as he said he could accept his wife having a relationship with a woman, but not with another man\n\n\u2018The committee notes that the mere fact that it is investigating these allegations, and publicly disclosing its review, does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred, or reflect any judgment on behalf of the committee.\u2019\n\nHill also said she has asked Capitol police to investigate the leaking of a photograph of her totally naked combing the fully clothed campaign worker\u2019s hair. \u2018Distributing intimate photos with the intent to publish them is a crime, and the perpetrator should be punished to the full extent of the law,\u2019 she wrote.\n\n\u2018I have notified Capitol Police, who are investigating it, and therefore will have no further comment on the matter.\n\n\u2018This smear campaign will not get in the way of the work I am doing every day to move our district and our country forward,\u2019 Hill wrote.\n\n\u2018I am truly grateful for the outpouring of support I have received from colleagues and constituents alike, and I know we will get through this together.\u2019\n\nThe bombshell that now threatens Hill\u2019s promising political career was originally reported by the Conservative website RedState on Friday. It said the \u2018throuple\u2019 relationship began when the campaign worker, was just 22.\n\nIt also claimed Hill had had the affair with Kelly that she has denied. Kelly did not return DailyMail.com\u2019s calls.\n\nIn a statement to DailyMail.com Tuesday, Hill said: \u2018The fact is I am going through a divorce from an abusive husband who seems determined to humiliate me.\n\n\u2018I am disgusted that my opponents would seek to exploit a private matter for political gain,\u2019 she added, without saying who she considered were her opponents.\n\n\u2018This coordinated effort to destroy me and people close to me is despicable and will not succeed,\u2019 she pledged. \u2018I, like many women who have faced attacks like this before, am stronger than those who want me to be afraid.\u2019\n\nHill, who won a previously staunch Republican seat north and east of Los Angeles \u2014 that includes the Ronald Reagan library \u2014 in the blue wave that swept much of California.\n\nShe is a vice chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, whose chairman Elijah Cummings died last week.\n\nRedState reported that both Hill and her husband Heslep were involved with the female campaign worker. It said the three went on several vacations together, including a trip to Alaska where the naked picture of Hill was taken. The report also included pictures of Hill kissing the young women.\n\nHill had used her love for Heslep to win her election, when she beat incumbent Republican Steve Knight by nine points. She gushed: 'Happy anniversary to the love of my life, my partner, and my best friend'\n\nIn all pictures the young woman\u2019s face was blurred out to keep her identity secret.\n\nDailyMail.com\u2019s attempts to contact Heslep, 36, have not been successful.\n\nRedState said both the woman and Hill\u2019s husband noticed a change in her demeanor after she took her seat in Congress in January, and by May she broke off her relationships with both of them, saying she wanted to focus on her \u2018important\u2019 work in Washington.\n\nTexts provided to the site showed Hill telling the woman: \u2018I still care about you.\u2019 The staffer replied: \u2018Well I still care about you, but I think I need a little more time to \u201cmove on\u201d before we can be friends.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018It\u2019s not that I hate you, it\u2019s just that it hurts too much to think about you at this point in time.\u2019\n\nThe site also obtained texts between the woman and Heslep sent this June, in which Heslep seems to admit the \u2018throuple\u2019 relationship had been toxic.\n\nHe wrote: 'It has been weighing very, very heavily on me lately. Part of my mind keeps trying to justify it because of katies [sic] abuse.\n\n'That she created the ''s**t rolls downhill'' situation. But that is no excuse whatsoever for what I did. So again, I'm sorry.'\n\nThe staffer replies: 'It was a dark time and you treated me really poorly but I also stayed which I have to own.'\n\nBut she admits she was 'ready to put together' a future with both Hill and Heslep, telling him: 'Think of how toxic our relationship was? And I was still ready to put together something real. To build a future on that absolutely abysmal foundation.'\n\nIn another text exchange between the young staffer and Heslep she said she feared losing her future in politics and friends as well as the relationship.\n\nShe wrote: 'Idk, I was getting ready and I was thinking about how much Katie liked to watch me [reference to a hobby]\u2026It's ok, she can't take [this] from me. She can ruin politics, take all my friends, and isolate me, but she can't have [this].'\n\nIn a message sent to Hill from the female staffer, she voices concern that Hill would treat her poorly, based on how she witnessed Hill treating Heslep.\n\nShe wrote: 'Babe I had a really unpleasant realization yesterday... I am terrified of pushing back against you or upsetting you. I have seen how you treat Kenny and I think that if I cause any issues, even if I am very worried about how you are acting that very quickly you will decide you don't want in your life.\n\n'I hope I am wrong but that's not really a good way for a partnership to be. I hope you know that if I am telling you something you don't want to hear it's because it's really important and not just to make your life more difficult. '\n\nHeslep filed for divorce on July 10 in Los Angeles, stating the couple, who have no children, had separated on July 5. He cited \u2018irreconcilable differences.\u2019\n\nHill agreed the marriage had broken down, although she said they had split on June 7 \u2014 less than a week before they were due to celebrate their ninth anniversary.\n\nHeslep filed for divorce on July 10 in Los Angeles, stating the couple, who have no children, had separated on July 5. He cited 'irreconcilable differences'\n\nHeslep, who described himself as a househusband who had not had a paying job since 2014 asked for \u2018reasonable spousal support and $10,700 in attorney\u2019s fees. Hill said both should pay their own way.\n\nAccording to the text messages, Heslep had been told that Hill was having an affair with Kelly, 31.\n\nIn a text to videographer Jeff Bomberger who had helped Hill in her campaign, Heslep said he could accept her having a relationship with a woman, but not with another man.\n\nAlthough Hill is now claiming the \u2018last few years\u2019 of her marriage were abusive and tumultuous, she told a different tale during her election campaign in which she beat incumbent Republican Steve Knight by nine points.\n\nHer campaign\u2019s Facebook page contained several pictures of him, but they have been pulled in recent days.\n\nOn June 12, 2017 \u2014 the couple\u2019s seventh wedding anniversary \u2014 she showed a picture of her kissing him on the cheek , writing to her supporters: \u2018Today, I want to introduce you to the person who makes this campaign possible: my husband Kenny.\n\n\u2018Running for office isn\u2019t easy, particularly when you\u2019re still working full time. Kenny has supported me every step of the way \u2014 from laundry and lunches to being my inspiration when things get hard. I could not do this without him.\u2019\n\nThat September she called him \u2018wonderful and supportive and thanked him for making fundraising calls for her.\n\nThe following June, she gushed: \u2018Happy anniversary to the love of my life, my partner, and my best friend.\u2019\n\nShe added: It\u2019s crazy to believe we\u2019ve been in each other\u2019s lives for fourteen years and married for eight. I don\u2019t think either of us could have ever guessed where we would be now, but I know I wouldn\u2019t be here without you.\n\n\u2018Your love and support get me through the toughest challenges life throw at us.\u2019\n\nTwo months before the election, she wrote: \u2018I am able to throw my all into this race because my husband, Kenny, is the toughest backbone anyone could ask for. He is at my side on my best days and on my worst, or or off the trail.\n\n\u2018Kenny, you are my best friend and the love of my life,\u2019 she wrote about the man she now calls \u2018abusive,\u2019 before adding: \u2018I am so proud of the life we\u2019ve built together and I can\u2019t wait to see what we do next.\u2019\n\nHill has described herself as bisexual all her adult life. She told the LGBTQ magazine The Advocate: \u2018I\u2019ve been out as bi since I was a teenager, right after high school,\u2019 saying it was part of being an \u2018honest, transparent politician.\u2019\n\nBefore running for Congress she was executive director of a group called People Assisting the Homeless. Her husband\u2019s most recent job was regional manager for the same group.", "description": "Democratic Rep.
