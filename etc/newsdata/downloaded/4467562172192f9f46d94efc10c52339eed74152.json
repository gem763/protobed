Yet the strongman has feet of clay. If suspending Parliament was intended to demonstrate Mr. Johnson\u2019s credentials as a champion of the people, it managed to unite only 27 percent of them. Further overreach as the prime minister attempts to break Parliament to his will is unlikely to improve that number.\n\nNobody doubts new elections are on the horizon, the central issues of which will be shaped in the next weeks. It will be an election that Mr. Johnson intends to fight on a narrow Brexit question. To beat him, the Labour Party, which has been as troubled by division between the two Brexit camps as the country as a whole, will not only need a clear message on Brexit but also some means of bridging its divide. Democracy could be a powerful theme: not just its defense in Parliament but its extension beyond Parliament\u2019s feudal residues and monarchical hangovers, into Britain\u2019s regions and its antiquated electoral system.\n\nIt is widely known that Mr. Johnson wants a \u201cpeople versus politicians\u201d election. Perhaps it is time for the opposition to push for \u201cthe country versus Boris Johnson.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["James Butler", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Brexit-Vote-Johnson-Uk.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
