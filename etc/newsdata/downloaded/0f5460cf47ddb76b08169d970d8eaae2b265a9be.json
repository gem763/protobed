As of August 2019, the planemaker has taken orders for 15,155 of them since 1965, when the jetliner was first unveiled. It delivered the 10,000th of these in April 2018, a (currently-grounded) 737 Max 8 to Southwest Airlines.\n\nDespite the missteps and tragic consequences surrounding the Max's initial design, the larger 737 family has proved itself as a faithful workhorse for airlines around the world, ranging from long-haul carriers like Delta that include the plane as a small part of its fleet, to low-cost airlines like Ryanair, which uses 737s for its entire fleet.\n\nAlthough the 737 looks likely to fly on for years to come, well past its 70th birthday, Boeing will need to prove to its customers that it's fixed the flawed Max and that it's learned enough from the episode to prevent it from ever happening again. The rival Airbus A320 family is nipping at its heels, with 14,789 orders through August. With Boeing failing to sell a single Max for more than five months, as customers wait to see how the company fixes the plane, the need to restore consumer confidence is urgent.\n\nHere's a closer look at the incredible 54-year history of the Boeing 737.", "description": "As Boeing works to fix the troubled 737 Max, we look back at the 55-year history of the venerable workhorse narrow-body airplane.", "authors": ["David Slotnick"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5bd74ce30d7c6700ba5b46dd-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
