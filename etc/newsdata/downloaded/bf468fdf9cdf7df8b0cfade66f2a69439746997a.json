But this is a dilemma of Trump\u2019s own making.\n\nWe are in this mess because Trump abandoned the landmark 2015 Iranian nuclear deal. Hawks argued that we could apply maximum pressure on Iran and inflict such pain that it would buckle, without appreciating that Iran could also ramp up the pressure on us.\n\nThat\u2019s the problem with hawks. They plan out their chess games and triumphantly plot a checkmate without appreciating the basic lesson of Sun Tzu or Clausewitz that the other side also gets to move.\n\nUnfortunately, without the Iran nuclear deal, all options are bad. We should be searching for ways to return to the agreement, with face-saving tweaks that would allow both Trump and the Iranian supreme leader to claim victory.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nicholas Kristof", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Iran-Saudi.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
