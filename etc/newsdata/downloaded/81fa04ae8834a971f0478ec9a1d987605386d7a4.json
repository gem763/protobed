Thank you - I'm great.'\n\nThe designer then explained why she has taken a break from the industry.\n\n'I've had some amazing experiences but ultimately for me running a fashion business was 80% logistics and 20% creative. I am not creatively fulfilled,' she wrote.\n\n'The magic moments were out weighed by too much stress and 16 hour days with no end in sight. It's not good for my mental health and it takes all the joy out of it. I've always been told to keep quiet about all the annoying things and take it on the chin.\n\n'I'm letting my samples go and ending a chapter and wanted to make light of some of the traumatic yet hilarious things that have happened that I'm sure a lot of other creatives can relate to.\n\n'Who knows maybe it will hold some stylists/celebs more accountable for other designers dealing with the same issues.\n\n'And I'm sorry to the stylists that are really professional and respect the work involved.'\n\nMs Major signed off by telling fans she is OK.\n\n'Once again - I'm doing great, the happiest I've been in a long time. Thank you for your concern.'", "description": "Jaime Major, from Perth, runs a fashion company in Los Angeles and has dressed stars including British singer Rita Ora and Belgian artist Gotye.", "authors": ["Charlie Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/01/20013626-0-image-a-38_1571703125993.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
