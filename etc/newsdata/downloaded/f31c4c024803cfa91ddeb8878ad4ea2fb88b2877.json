Of course. Did he stiff small businesses? Indeed. Did he create scams such as Trump University that stole people\u2019s life savings? You betcha. Did he run a fake \u201cfoundation\u201d? Sure. Did he employ undocumented workers? Naturally.\n\nAD\n\nIn many of those cases, however, Trump may have done corrupt and morally repugnant things without literally breaking the law. But ask yourself this: When it comes to his financial life, what do you think the chances are that Trump hasn\u2019t committed crimes?\n\nAD\n\nI ask because of this extraordinary investigation from ProPublica, which obtained documentation on just a couple of Trump projects that show how he does business:\n\nDocuments obtained by ProPublica show stark differences in how Donald Trump\u2019s businesses reported some expenses, profits and occupancy figures for two Manhattan buildings, giving a lender different figures than they provided to New York City tax authorities. The discrepancies made the buildings appear more profitable to the lender \u2014 and less profitable to the officials who set the buildings\u2019 property tax. For instance, Trump told the lender that he took in twice as much rent from one building as he reported to tax authorities during the same year, 2017. He also gave conflicting occupancy figures for one of his signature skyscrapers, located at 40 Wall Street. [...] A dozen real estate professionals told ProPublica they saw no clear explanation for multiple inconsistencies in the documents. The discrepancies are \u201cversions of fraud,\u201d said Nancy Wallace, a professor of finance and real estate at the Haas School of Business at the University of California-Berkeley. \u201cThis kind of stuff is not OK.\u201d\n\nNot only is it not okay, if Trump was lying on both ends, to the bank and to tax authorities \u2014 and does anyone doubt he would? \u2014 it also could mean that he committed both bank fraud and tax fraud.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen testified to Congress that this is a pattern with Trump. \u201cIt was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes,\u201d Cohen said, \u201cand deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.\u201d We have lots of evidence of Trump buying a property, then contesting his tax assessment by having his lawyers argue that, in fact, it is worth next to nothing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s one thing if Trump just brags that some property is worth much more than it is, or even if he makes questionable claims to local governments when he contests his tax bill. But loan applications and tax filings are legal documents, and knowingly lying on them is against the law.\n\nProPublica found multiple instances in which Trump told banks and tax agencies radically different things about the same properties, the same income streams and the same expenses.\n\nYou might say this is just one more story showing how corrupt Trump is, which we knew already. But it\u2019s an important illustration of something that could become important soon: Trump isn\u2019t just occasionally corrupt; he\u2019s promiscuously corrupt. Pick a Trump deal at random, and the likelihood that it\u2019s all aboveboard seems vanishingly small.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith a series of contested subpoenas moving through the courts \u2014 with Trump losing at every step \u2014 the day when we see his tax returns could come very soon. Within those returns lie hundreds of Trump projects and deals, each of which will require some sleuthing by journalists to figure out who is involved and whether what\u2019s in the documents is true.\n\nThat is what Trump is truly afraid of and why he has worked so hard to keep those returns hidden. The story that he doesn\u2019t want people to know he\u2019s not as rich as he says might be accurate. But much more important, he could be afraid that the returns reveal what is essentially an ongoing financial crime spree.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve seen only a small portion of it.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Just imagine what his tax returns will reveal.", "authors": ["Paul Waldman", "Opinion Writer Covering Politics", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PCklzbOCqJn6mf32nl8OiVU9puQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J2XBFDHPRYI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
