I tried to return the box but was told by our staffers it is difficult to return gifts to him. So I kept it in a safety box at our office,\u201d he said.\n\nIwane said that none of the executives had any intention of keeping the gifts and many had returned them to Moriyama.\n\nKansai Electric has long been reliant on nuclear power. Before the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant operated by Tokyo Electric Power (9501.T), Kansai relied on nuclear reactors for nearly half of its electricity generation.\n\nThe Fukushima disaster, in which three reactors suffered a meltdown after a massive earthquake and tsunami, shattered public trust in nuclear power. Kansai Electric operates three reactors, the most among Japanese utilities.\n\nThe mayor of Osaka, the largest shareholder in Kansai Electric, is considering seeking a management reshuffle at the utility, the Mainichi newspaper reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe city of Osaka owns close to 7.3% of Kansai Electric, Refinitiv data shows.", "description": "The president of Japan's Kansai Electric Power Co <9503.T> has no intention of resigning, he said on Wednesday, after admitting that he and 19 company employees had received payments and gifts worth 320 million yen ($3 million).", "authors": ["Junko Fujita", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
