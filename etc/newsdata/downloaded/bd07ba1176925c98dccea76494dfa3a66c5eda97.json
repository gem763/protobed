It operates a nationwide mobile money-transfer business that serves 15 million Americans.\n\nBut Square says it isn\u2019t a financial company.\n\nThe San Francisco-based payments processor filed a lawsuit last week against its home city to recover $1.3 million in taxes, plus interest and attorneys\u2019 fees. Square argued that San Francisco was wrong to classify it as a financial company for tax purposes because it is a technology company that should be subject to a lower tax rate.\n\nSan Francisco charges financial-services companies a tax rate between about 0.40% and 0.56% of their gross receipts. Tech companies pay between about 0.13% and 0.48%.\n\nThe refund Square is seeking from San Francisco relates to excess taxes it believes it paid for 2014 and 2015, years when Square was a much smaller company. Square disclosed in its most recent securities filing that it may have to pay San Francisco additional taxes for subsequent years if it was unable to convince the city it was a tech company.\n\nSquare, headed by Jack Dorsey,says its San Francisco operations more closely resemble a technology company than a financial-services firm.

Startups such as Robinhood Markets Inc., Social Finance Inc. and Stripe Inc. have raised oceans of venture capital and succeeded in convincing investors that they should be valued more like makers of software than the established payments, lending and wealth-management businesses from which they are trying to take market share.\n\nSquare\u2019s legal action takes that argument to another level. The company said in its complaint that its San Francisco operations more closely resemble a technology company than a financial-services firm. The company has roughly 2,200 employees in San Francisco.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Should corporate tax rates be tied to a company\u2019s industry? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cSquare\u2019s production processes are primarily focused on the development and production of software,\u201d the company said in a complaint filed in California state court. \u201cThe vast majority of Square\u2019s employees are either software engineers or employees supporting them.\u201d\n\nSquare also said in its lawsuit that San Francisco overstates Square\u2019s gross receipts because it includes money that the company doesn\u2019t get to keep. Square takes a 2.75% cut of most credit-card payments to its small-business customers. More than half of what Square derives from those transactions must be paid out to banks and credit-card networks, the company said.\n\n\u201cWe have and will continue to pay our fair share, but when we\u2019re treated differently than other companies and taxed on money we never actually receive, this is not fair or consistent,\" a Square spokeswoman said in a statement.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s treasurer and tax collector, Jose Cisneros, said in an email that his office\u2019s audit of Square was \u201cthorough and fair\u201d and that he stands by its findings. Mr. Cisneros is also a defendant in the case.\n\nLast year, Square Chief Executive Jack Dorsey opposed a local ballot measure, Proposition C, that would have increased taxes on Square and other businesses to raise money to fight homelessness in San Francisco. Salesforce.com Inc. CEO Marc Benioff rebuked Mr. Dorsey for his position and questioned how much Mr. Dorsey had given back to the city.\n\nSquare \u201cwould be taxed at a significantly larger total contribution than much larger companies like Salesforce,\u201d Mr. Dorsey wrote on Twitter last October, saying the measure was unfair to Square and fintech startups.\n\nSan Francisco voters approved Proposition C last November. A month later, Square announced plans to open a large new office across the Bay Bridge in Oakland.\n\nWrite to Peter Rudegeair at Peter.Rudegeair@wsj.com", "description": "Square has lent billions to small businesses and consumers and applied for a banking license, but it says it isn\u2019t a financial company.", "authors": ["Peter Rudegeair", "Peter.Rudegeair Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106393/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
