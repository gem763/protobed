They\u2019re filled with whisky. And they\u2019re now drawing a collective groan from the Internet, thanks to their suspicious resemblance to a laundry detergent pack-turned-meme-turned-public health hazard.\n\nThat\u2019s right: They\u2019re alcoholic Tide Pods.\n\nWell, sort of.\n\nIn what is either a highly successful marketing scheme or a inadvertent attempt to launch itself into millennial relevancy, a 195-year-old single-malt Scotch whisky distillery has rolled out three kinds of limited-edition \u201cglass-less cocktails,\u201d available through Sunday at a posh London bar.\n\nThese alcoholic amuse-bouche pouches provide \u201cthe perfect flavour-explosion experience,\u201d The Glenlivet claims.\n\nBut as hundreds of baffled commenters online immediately wanted to know: How do you \u201cdrink\u201d them?\n\n\u201cEnjoying them is simple,\u201d said the distillery in a 53-second video last week. \u201cThe capsules are popped in the mouth for an instant burst of flavour.\u201d\n\nThen, \u201cthe capsule is simply swallowed.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurely this is a sick joke,\u201d said Julia Macfarlane, a foreign affairs reporter with ABC News, asking the Scottish prime minister to intervene. \u201cThis is an abomination. What is going on. Somebody do something.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh dear lord no,\u201d wrote the Scottish actor Sam Heughan, who has announced plans to launch his own (non-capsuled) line of whisky.\n\nWhile the pods might seem a departure for an august Scotch producer, Miriam Eceolaza, the distillery\u2019s director, argued that they actually honor the legacy of The Glenlivet\u2019s founder, George Smith. While illicitly operating the distillery in the 1840s and arming himself with pistols to protect the business from political blowback, Smith \u201calways went against the grain, bucking tradition and doing things differently,\u201d Eceolaza said in an announcement.\n\nThe distillery\u2019s latest creation is certainly a different approach to a drink that is meant to be sipped. And in so doing, it has, either intentionally or inadvertently, fashioned a corporate, adult and European revival of an adolescent, American, homegrown meme \u2014 one that few seemed to have wanted a reminder of.\n\nyou know gen z is getting older when they\u2019re selling alcoholic tide pods https://t.co/rJ0RBMRDYu \u2014 jabookie (@jaboukie) October 5, 2019\n\nBut in case you need a refresher anyway: Around January 2018, the Internet lit aflame in its crazed obsession over Tide Pods, as a handful of teens were hospitalized, government officials offered warnings and tech giants took swift action. The culprit? YouTube videos of adolescents biting into the colorful packs of plastic-wrapped laundry detergent.\n\n[Teens are daring each other to eat Tide pods. We don\u2019t need to tell you that\u2019s a bad idea.]\n\nNow, The Glenlivet wants adult patrons to sink their teeth into seaweed-wrapped whisky pods containing one of three cocktails: a zesty citrus mix (which includes bergamot, sherry and lemon), spice (verjus and two kinds of bitters) and a flavor known only as \u201cwood\u201d (containing vermouth and, aptly, notes of sandalwood and cedarwood).\n\nIt\u2019s all fun and games until you mix these up with your Tide pods and end up with whiskey-soaked clothes and a stomach pump https://t.co/MAz8L0YvvG \u2014 Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) October 5, 2019\n\nAll three concoctions were created by the Czech bartender Alex Kratena for London Cocktail Week, the city\u2019s annual celebration of alcohol innovation, exclusively available through Oct. 13 for patrons of his Tay\u0113r + Elementary bar, on the city\u2019s bustling Old Street.\n\nKratena said his bar and The Glenlivet had teamed up with Notpla, a start-up that focuses on putting together alternative and sustainable packages.\n\n\u201cIt was very much an exploration of the flavor pillars that are in the Glenlivet. For me, there\u2019s so much more which makes the liquid complex,\u201d he told The Washington Post. \u201cWhen you insert them in your mouth and gently press them against your palate, you get all the flavors.\u201d\n\nKratena said that any similarity to Tide Pods, or the meme they starred in, is purely coincidental. He did not intend to find a new way to sneak alcohol into all sorts of situations where a handle or even a flask might be too obvious, as some have suggested.\n\nNeed to get your drink on at work?\n\nWanna sneak a little sumpin' sumpin' into your next restricted venue?\n\nNo worries!\n\nAnd, you can ditch the flask!\n\nPeople gon' be sucking these down like Tide pods! https://t.co/xmiGLcAdKm \u2014 Marsha Warfield (@MarshaWarfield) October 5, 2019\n\nHe suggested that the packaging \u2014 a thin, seemingly invisible layer of seaweed that holds up to 23 milliliters of whisky cocktail \u2014 is a call for more sustainable consumption of liquor. The seaweed used for the capsule has also been used by Notpla to create water capsules, a handy pouch of liquid for runners in the London Marathon. Besides working to de-acifidy the oceans, that seaweed is also biodegradable.\n\nseeing these being called laundry pods, but the pod is made from seaweed\n\n\n\nso\n\n\n\ntechnically this is sushi https://t.co/D0y3QsOSZn \u2014 moth dad \u27a1\ufe0f gone hiking (@innesmck) October 5, 2019\n\nMost people seemed like they weren\u2019t having it.\n\n\u201cJust put it in an IV bag,\u201d wrote the author Roxane Gay. \u201cLet\u2019s get to the inevitable conclusion.\u201d\n\nJust put it in an IV bag.
