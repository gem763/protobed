Perry reportedly refused a scene that saw his character sneak into a gay bar\n\nRoss, played by David Schwimmer, being unable to cope with having a male nanny was also the punchline to an episode that 'had not aged well', according to critics.\n\nAnd during the show's lesbian wedding the brides were not actually allowed to kiss.\n\nAusterlitz also writes that the idea of Monica, played by Courtney Cox, and Chandler getting together 'began as a whim' and the writers' room was split over whether to actually go ahead with the storyline.\n\nHe writes: 'When the second season was being planned, one of the writers tossed out an idea: 'What if we get Chandler and Monica together?''.\n\n'The thought was intended less as a permanent shift in the gravity of the series and more as a fun plot line, good for a few episodes before the status quo snapped back into place.'\n\nOne writer called the idea 'a little desperate', and it wasn't brought back up until the staff started working on season 4 when someone suggested it as a funny end to Monica's drunken night of self-doubt after the wedding of brother Ross, to Emily in London.", "description": "An idea by Friends writers to have Chandler, played by Matthew Perry, to visit a gay bar because he liked the tuna melts they served, was said to have been rejected by the actor, a new book revealed.", "authors": ["Chris Dyer For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/13/19296806-0-image-a-35_1570193212293.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
