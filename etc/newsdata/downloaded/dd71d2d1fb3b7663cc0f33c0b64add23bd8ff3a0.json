McAleenan, who added that the rule is intended to discourage migrants from traveling through Mexico to reach the United States.\n\nAdvocacy organizations were swift to condemn the Trump administration\u2019s latest attempt to weaken the nation\u2019s asylum system, and vowed to fight the proposed rule change in court.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is trying to unilaterally reverse our country's legal and moral commitment to protect those fleeing danger,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project. \u201cThis new rule is patently unlawful and we will sue swiftly.\u201d\n\nThe Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES) said that the rule change amounts to \u201cending asylum protections for all minorities,\u201d and vowed to fight the proposal \u201cin the courts and in the streets.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an Asian ban. It\u2019s a Muslim ban. It\u2019s a Latino ban. It\u2019s a Black ban,\u201d the organization said in a release. \u201cIt\u2019s racist and wrong on every level.\u201d\n\nAaron C. Morris, executive director of Immigration Equality, a nonprofit that advocates for LGBT people in the immigration system, called the proposed rules \u201creprehensible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is their most blatant attempt so far to dismantle the asylum system altogether in clear violation of domestic and international law,\u201d Morris saiad. \u201cLGBTQ people have remarkably strong asylum cases due to the high risk of persecution in their countries of origin. Denying them the chance to apply for protection in the United States will lead to senseless and avoidable violence and death.\u201d\n\nUnder the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as well as a host of international treaty agreements, all migrants who enter the country by any means are entitled to apply for asylum protections if they claim that they fear persecution or violence in their home countries. Refoulement, the legal term for the forcible return of asylum-seekers to countries where they face potential persecution or torture, is illegal under both the INA and international law.\n\nAttorney General William Barr said in a statement that the proposed rule changes will sidestep these barriers, citing a section of the INA that allows the government \u201cto enhance the integrity of the asylum process\u201d by placing additional restrictions on asylum seekers.\n\n\u201cThe United States is a generous country but is being completely overwhelmed by the burdens associated with apprehending and processing hundreds of thousands of aliens along the southern border,\u201d Barr said, an argument that has been met with stiff legal challenges in other suits against the administration\u2019s unilateral attempts to change the asylum system.\n\nUnder the proposed rule change, migrants must satisfy at least one of three stipulations to be allowed to seek asylum in the United States: have applied for asylum protections in at least one country through which they transited en route to the United States, and been denied; prove that they are a victim of human trafficking; or prove that they traveled to the United States exclusively through one of a few dozen countries that are not party to international treaty agreements regulating the treatment of asylum seekers.\n\nBut by discouraging asylum seekers from using legal means of entry, advocates said that the rule change will likely increase the number of people turning to human traffickers to get into the country.\n\n\u201cEvery time there\u2019s a new law enforcement initiative, traffickers and smugglers are very adept at adapting it to their own advantage,\u201d Wendy Young, executive director of Kids In Need of Defense, told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cIf people perceive that it\u2019s too hard to get to the border to present themselves... they may fall into the trap\u201d of seeking assistance from human traffickers, Young added, which means that the rule change could result in the U.S. government \u201cinadvertently fueling transnational criminal activity.\u201d\n\nIn addition to exacerbating the problems that the Trump administration hopes to address\u2014a common issue with the White House\u2019s immigration policies\u2014the rule change contains a fairly glaring contradiction. One of the treaties named in the proposed rule change, the United Nations Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, prevents the forcible return of asylum-seekers to countries where they face persecution, torture, or death\u2014a likely result if the proposed rule were to be implemented.\n\nThe rules are the latest attempt by the Trump administration to curb access to asylum system, which the president has called \u201cridiculous\u201d and riddled with \u201cmajor loopholes.\u201d Other moves to discourage asylum have included threatened tariffs against Mexico if it failed to interdict migrants headed north, the so-called \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy barring asylum-seekers from entering the United States to seek asylum, and the aforementioned nationwide raids on undocumented immigrants, first issued as a threat if Congress did not pass new asylum restrictions.\n\nEven among those other attempts to limit access to asylum, advocates called the rule change uniquely dangerous.\n\n\u201cThis rule reaches a shameful new low,\u201d said Archi Pyati, chief of policy at the Tahirih Justice Center, which provides legal services to immigrant women and girls fleeing gender-based violence and persecution. \u201cChildren fleeing life-threatening circumstances, women fleeing rape and severe domestic violence, families trying to avoid persecution\u2014none will be allowed to seek asylum. This blanket rejection of asylum claims simply because someone approaches the southern border is inhuman and unfair.\u201d", "description": "Advocacy organizations were swift to condemn the Trump administration\u2019s latest attempt to weaken the nation\u2019s asylum system\u2014and vowed to fight the proposed rule change in court.", "authors": ["Scott Bixby", "National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1563208978/190715-bixby-asylum-law-tease_vzqnht", "published_at": "2019-07-15"}
