Amy had given him water and came back an hour later to find him gone.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are like, how do you let a tortoise escape? They\u2019re like bulldozers.\u201d Kevin Goulart\n\nSightings have been reported, including northwest of Dean, in the Kamay area and halfway between Electra and Vernon along U.S. Highway 287.\n\n\u201cHe may be looking for a mate or something like that,\" Kevin said. \"I don\u2019t really know. In the wild, they range hundreds of miles.\u201d\n\nA big tortoise turned up in Oklahoma City and another in Dallas, but Kevin could tell from looking at pictures that they weren't Mr. Mabel.\n\n'Content not to be caught': Betsy the cow escaped the rodeo and has wandered Alaska for months\n\nWhat to do if you find Mr. Mabel\n\nIf anyone finds the tortoise, contain him temporarily in a shed or fenced area and call Kevin at (940) 215-4893, he said. But don't flip Mr. Mabel onto his back because he could suffocate.\n\nA gentle manner is best when approaching Mr. Mabel.\n\nJust say, \"Hey, buddy,\" and let him sniff your hand or shoe, Kevin said. Mr. Mabel will startled at abrupt movements.\n\nSulcata tortoises are known to bond with their owners and have plenty of personality.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s friendly,\" Kevin said. \"They know you, and they know your voice. They\u2019ll come up to you and let you scratch their head.\"\n\nThey also like bright colors, he said.\n\nCow escapes truck to slaughterhouse: Then, it gave birth to calf at animal sanctuary\n\nMr Mabel (Photo: Courtesy/Kevin Goulart)\n\n\"They\u2019re very smart, and they're super strong,\" Kevin said. \"Their sense of hearing and sight is amazing. They can hear you walking from 100 feet.\u201d\n\nThe Marvelous Mr. Mabel\n\nTortoises like Mr. Mabel can outlive their owners and become a legacy pet for their children, Kevin said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been around longer than our kids,\" Kevin said. \"We have a 7-year-old boy, and my daughter, she\u2019s 15 months.\u201d\n\nKevin isn't worried about the vegetarian tortoise finding something to eat -- although he won't be getting the treats he does at home.\n\nA bear broke into a house: He left through a wall 'like the Kool-Aid Man'\n\n\u201cI would say 80 plus percent of his diet is grass, so he could survive on what\u2019s out there,\" he said.\n\nThe sulcata tortoise -- also called the African spurred tortoise -- is the biggest mainland tortoise and can reach well over 100 pounds, according to the San Diego Zoo. This tortoise is able to survive weeks without food and water, but it can gulp up to 15 percent of its body weight when it does find water.\n\nKevin said Mr. Mabel can't swim but might go to water for a drink or a soak.\n\nMr Mabel hangs out with another family pet.

But Kevin is worried about coyotes, bobcats and other predators, and his pet can't right himself if he becomes flipped upside down.\n\nThe tortoise started out named \"Mabel,\" Kevin said.\n\n\u201cWe planned on keeping him in Arizona because it\u2019s a lot easier to keep him in a desert environment. When we made our move here to North Texas, he came with us after some debate.\u201d Kevin Goulart\n\n\"Usually the two-to-four year mark is when you know if they\u2019re male or female,\" he said.\n\nEven after it became apparent that Mabel was a mister, the name just stuck, Kevin said. They knew Mr. Mabel was going to get huge when they got him.\n\n\u201cWe planned on keeping him in Arizona because it\u2019s a lot easier to keep him in a desert environment,\" Kevin said. \"When we made our move here to North Texas, he came with us after some debate.\u201d\n\nThey moved to Dean in 2017. The tiny town, population 480, is situated approximately 10 miles northeast of Wichita Falls.\n\nIn the hunt for Mr. Mabel, Amy and Kevin have probably searched 2,000 acres and 100 miles of roads in the Dean area, Kevin said.\n\nThe community has responded on social media and in real life as the Goularts found out when they drove to nearby Henrietta to get the word out.\n\n\u201cWe went there to put up flyers, but somebody had already done it,\" Kevin said.\n\nFollow Trish Choate on @Trishapedia.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/16/texas-family-searching-90-pound-pet-tortoise-escaped/4001400002/", "description": "A family is searching far and wide for a 90-pound pet tortoise who escaped his enclosure Oct. 9 in Dean in North Texas.
