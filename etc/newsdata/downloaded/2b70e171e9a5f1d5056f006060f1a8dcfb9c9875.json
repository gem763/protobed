Often, children have also moved to distant cities for work, adding to the need for caregivers.\n\nBy the end of 2018, China had a population of 249 million people aged 60 or older. About a quarter of that number have either physiological or cognitive disabilities, requiring care, according to the World Bank.\n\nIn contrast, a recent official estimate puts the number of certified caregivers at 300,000.\n\nChina aims to increase that by 2 million before the end of 2022, the Ministry of Civil Affairs said this week.\n\nThe education ministry also recently said that every province ought to have one university offering majors in care for the elderly.\n\n\u201cThe main problem is supply,\u201d said a user of the Weibo social media site.\n\n\u201cCaring for the old is not easy, and people won\u2019t do it if they are not paid well.\u201d\n\nCaregivers at nursing homes in big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai can earn up to 5,000 yuan ($700) a month, but salaries are often lower in smaller cities.\n\nInformal caregivers, often migrant workers, get less for looking after the elderly at home.\n\nThe number of old-age homes is rising but they are too expensive for most families and largely perceived to be riddled with abuse.\n\nThree-quarters of old people prefer to live out their days at home, official surveys show.", "description": "China has scrapped a requirement of formal education for people seeking to be certified as caregivers for the elderly in a bid to increase their number by 2 million and plug a supply shortage.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442236922&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0U4", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
