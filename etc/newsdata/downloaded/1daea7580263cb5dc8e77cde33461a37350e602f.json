The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) is up roughly 50% since the Nov. 8, 2016 election, rising from roughly 18,300 to just over 27,000 presently. President Trump has attributed the gains to his administration\u2019s economic policies, which have included corporate tax cuts and broader deregulation measures. The stock market has been less welcoming of President Trump\u2019s trade policies.\n\nU.S. first lady Melania Trump speaks during a roundtable discussion with local and state leaders at Cabell-Huntington Health Department in Huntington, W.V., U.S., July 8, 2019.
