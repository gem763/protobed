There are challenges - high streets need to become more inventive.\n\n\"We want Our Front Door to be a starting point for a much bigger art project to bring art into the town.\"\n\nImage caption Directly opposite the offices of The Stoke-on-Trent BID on Cheapside is this door painted by Tom Edwards\n\nVisitors can tour Hanley with a map highlighting the 18 doors that feature in the project.\n\nImage caption A young girl and her teddy bear peer through a door on Hillchurch Street. This artwork was created by Tom Addis\n\n\"The reaction through social media has been excellent with really positive feedback,\" said Richard.\n\n\"We chose doors that had been covered in graffiti to put something much more positive instead. I think they are amazing.\"\n\nImage caption On Lower Foundry Street is this image by Adam Madeley. A survey suggested 87% of Hanley businesses strongly agreed that an improved look and feel should be prioritised for the city centre\n\nImage caption Morley Street image by Rob Fenton, from Entrepreneurs Network, who worked with young artists from YMCA to decide a theme and style for each door\n\nArtists Rob Fenton and Tom Edwards, co-owners of Entrepreneurs Network, both have work on show on the streets of Hanley.\n\n\"My main aim in all of the work I do is to help the city of Stoke-on-Trent grow and evolve, so it's great we can be so involved with the BID's plans to improve the look and feel of the area through artwork installations,\" said Rob.\n\n\"The creative people in this city are capable of so much positive change and development, and projects such as this are certainly a step in the right direction,\" Tom added.\n\nImage caption Tucked away in the Parliament Row alleyway is this image by Dave Newey\n\nImage caption A painted door on Old Hall Street by Know One is part of the city centre trail with maps available around Hanley\n\nPhotographer: John Bray\n\nGet in touch\n\nWhat are you proud of about the city and what are the stories you think we should tell more people about?\n\nHave you got a question about Stoke-on-Trent you would like us to answer?
