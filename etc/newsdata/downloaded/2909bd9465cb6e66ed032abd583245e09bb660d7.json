Charles said the enormous sum is concentrated in hiring 20,000 workers in a tight labor market, training, equipment and aggressive marketing.\n\n\u201cBreakfast does not provide Wendy's a competitive advantage, and thus does not lend visibility on either enduring sales growth or a growth plan with lower investment needs,\u201d Charles wrote in a note to clients along with a downgrade in rating on Wendy\u2019s to Market-perform. \u201cWe see risk breakfast requires intensified focus from management that could prove to be a distraction.\u201d\n\nWendy\u2019s surprised investors in early September with plans to hire 20,000 people to drive a nationwide rollout of breakfast in 2020. The menu \u2014 spanning 5,900 or so U.S. restaurants \u2014 will feature two premium-priced sandwiches that appear to be very differentiated relative to McDonald\u2019s McMuffin and Burger King\u2019s (QSR) Croisan\u2019wich: Breakfast Baconator and the Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit.\n\nAn Egg McMuffin meal is pictured at a McDonald's restaurant in Encinitas, California August 13, 2015. McDonald's Corp, which is expected to offer all-day breakfasts starting this fall to turn around slumping U.S. sales, is the top choice for \"Breakfastarians,\" who crave breakfast food at any hour, according to a new survey obtained by Reuters on August 17, 2015.

Recall that Wendy\u2019s is no stranger to the broader breakfast game. The company made unsuccessful forays into breakfast in 1985 and 2007. Both times, the mighty McMuffin won out.\n\nSo, the investor cautiousness is understandable, especially considering the strong competitors with more established breakfast platforms.\n\nNow all eyes will turn to Wendy\u2019s key analyst day on October 11, where the company is expected to reveal longer term financial targets and more details on its breakfast entry.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
