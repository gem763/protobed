They claim such bans would rob doctors of their leverage in negotiating, drive down their payments and push them out of insurance networks.\n\nOpponents have been waging well-financed campaigns. Slick TV ads and congressional lobbyists seek to stop legislation that had widespread support from voters. Nearly 40% of patients said they were \u201cvery worried\u201d about surprise medical bills, which generally arise when an insured individual inadvertently receives care from an out-of-network provider.\n\nBut as lobbyists purporting to represent doctors and hospitals fight the proposals, it has become increasingly clear that the force behind the multimillion-dollar crusade is not only medical professionals, but also investors in private equity and venture capital firms.\n\nIn the past eight years, in such fields as emergency medicine and anesthesia, investors have bought and now operate many large physician-staffing companies. And key to their highly profitable business strategy is to not participate in insurance networks, allowing them to send surprise bills and charge patients a price they set\u2014with few limitations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve started to realize it\u2019s not us versus the hospitals or the doctors, it\u2019s us versus the hedge funds,\u201d said James Gelfand, senior vice president of health policy at ERIC, a group that represents large employers.\n\n\u201cThey have money to burn,\u201d said a Democratic congressional aide with knowledge of the lobbying efforts \u201cThey\u2019re in take-the-bill-down mode.\u201d\n\nPrivate equity firms and the staffing companies they own have a lot to lose, too. While doctors largely once worked for hospitals or had individual contracts, many hospitals now rely on these huge staffing businesses to provide doctors for various departments. Companies like Envision Physician Services and TeamHealth provide doctors to dozens, sometimes hundreds of hospitals. Private equity firms back these ever-growing outsourced staffing companies.\n\nBecause patients have no effective way to protect themselves from unexpected medical bills, even knowledgeable, proactive people with comprehensive insurance can find themselves whisked away to an out-of-network hospital in an emergency or treated by an out-of-network anesthesiologist at the in-network hospital they selected.\n\nSeveral lawmakers have adopted the issue, one seemingly ready-made for campaign season: In fighting surprise bills, they are attacking a practice both reviled by the public and easy to explain.\n\nWhat\u2019s harder to explain is where the money on the other side of the campaign comes from. Coalitions like Physicians for Fair Coverage and dark-money groups with innocuous names like Doctor Patient Unity have flooded the airwaves with ads urging people to call their lawmakers and voice opposition to ending surprise bills. And those lawmakers are overwhelmingly senators facing difficult reelection fights next year, who might be hesitant to vote for change\u2014especially if it means more expensive ad campaigns aimed at taking them down.\n\nTo understand the power and size of private equity in the U.S. health care system, one must first understand physician-staffing firms.\n\nIncreasingly, hospitals have turned to third-party companies to fill their facilities with doctors. Among driving factors: physician shortages, a bigger insured population because of the Affordable Care Act and an aging population, according to research from the investment firm Harris Williams & Co.\n\nIn some areas, doctors have few options but to contract with a staffing service, which hires them out and helps with the billing and other administrative headaches that occupy much of a doctor\u2019s time. Staffing companies often have profit-sharing agreements with hospitals, so some of the money from billing patients is passed back to the hospitals.\n\nThe two largest staffing firms, EmCare and TeamHealth, together make up about 30% of the physician-staffing market.\n\nThat\u2019s where private equity comes in. A private equity firm buys companies and passes on the profits they squeeze out of them to the firm\u2019s investors. Private equity deals in health care have doubled in the past 10 years. TeamHealth is owned by Blackstone, a private equity firm. Envision and EmCare are owned by KKR, another private equity firm.\n\nWith affiliates in every state, these privately owned, profit-driven companies staff emergency rooms, own dialysis facilities and operate physician practices. Research from 2017 shows that when EmCare entered a market, out-of-network billing rates went up between 81 and 90 percentage points. When TeamHealth began working with a hospital, its rates increased by 33 percentage points.\n\nA study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 1 in 6 Americans with insurance were surprised by a medical bill after treatment at a hospital in 2017.\n\nThat is no coincidence: In many states, balance billing\u2014when a provider charges a patient the difference between their fee and what their insurance company paid\u2014is legal, so physician-staffing services have little incentive to contract with insurance companies and provide in-network doctors.\n\n\u201cThese physician-staffing companies are benefiting tremendously from the ability to bill out-of-network,\u201d said Zack Cooper, an associate professor of public health at Yale, who has studied physician-staffing firms and balance billing. \u201cIt\u2019s a small but profitable sliver of the health care system that these firms are using to make pretty significant amounts of money.\u201d\n\nCooper said the business models are built on the ability to get profits from balance billing.\n\n\u201cPrivate equity firms are buying up physician practices that allow them to bill out-of-network, cloaking themselves in the halo that physicians generally receive and then actively watering down any legislation that would both protect patients but affect their bottom line,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nThe staffing firm Envision disputed this assessment of its business model. An emailed statement said more than 90% of its business comes from in-network agreements and that the company continues \u201dactively advocating for a federal solution to surprise medical bills.\u201d\n\nThe two possible solutions on the table in congressional legislation are arbitration and benchmarking.\n\nArbitration sends the insurers and health care providers through an independent review to determine a fair price in the event of a balance bill.\n\nUnder benchmarking, out-of-network physician charges are paid by the patient\u2019s health plan based on an average of what other in-network doctors in the area are paid. Money is being spent on all sides of the debate, but for the physicians and private equity firms, it\u2019s weighted most heavily on the side of arbitration.\n\nAssorted groups have organized themselves into different coalitions and mega-groups to pool resources for lobbying and ads. On the side of benchmarking, there is the Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing, made up of employers and insurers like Blue Cross Blue Shield, the Association of Health Insurance Plans and ERIC, which represents large employers.\n\nOn the arbitration side, there is Out of the Middle, Physicians for Fair Coverage, SOAR and Doctor Patient Unity, to name a few. Ostensibly, these are composed of doctor and hospital groups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that federal legislation to end surprise billing also incentivizes all providers and insurers to negotiate in good faith in order to increase the number of in-network providers and ensure patients\u2019 continued access to high-quality medical care,\u201d added Megan Taylor, a spokeswoman for Physicians for Fair Coverage.\n\nYet these groups are dominated by private equity and hedge-fund-backed organizations. Physicians for Fair Coverage is made up of ApolloMD (a staffing firm owned in part by the investment firm ValorBridge), Radiology Partners (a staffing firm owned in part by the investment firm New Enterprise Associates) and a trio of staffing firms called US Acute Care Solutions, US Radiology Specialists and US Anesthesia partners (all partly owned by the investment firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson and Stowe).\n\nAmong the groups listed as lobbying on surprise bills are hospital groups like Christus Health (which uses EmCare) and Wellstar Health Systems (which uses ApolloMD). In addition, HCA, a large hospital chain that has had a joint venture with EmCare, has also been active on these issues.\n\nEven the groups that appear to represent independent doctors are tied to private equity and staffing firms. Out of the Middle consists of trade organizations for specialty doctors, like the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and the American Society of Anesthesiologists and many others. It\u2019s mostly run by ACEP, whose immediate past president, Dr. Rebecca Parker, was also a senior vice president at Envision.\n\nSpending on lobbying around this issue has been generous, according to disclosures from the Center for Responsive Politics. The staffing firm Mednax spent $180,000 on lobbying the House and Senate. TeamHealth and TeamHealth Inc. together spent $100,000. Physicians for Fair Coverage spent $145,000. US Physician Partners, an \u201cinformal lobbying group\u201d that never lobbied before 2019, spent $130,000.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way we can match them,\u201d said Gelfand, from ERIC. \u201cWe\u2019re entering this debate knowing we\u2019re being horrifically outspent.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.
