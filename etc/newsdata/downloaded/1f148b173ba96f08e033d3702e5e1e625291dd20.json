The female official in charge refused to explain the papers\u2019 contents, he said. As Ahmed was about to sign and fingerprint the last document, he noticed she was deliberately using her fingers to cover the Arabic translation of the words voluntary return. When he retracted his finger, she called in the guards, who took Ahmed to a nearby bathroom with another Syrian who had refused to sign. There, he said, the two were intimidated for several hours, and he was shown images of a man who had been badly beaten and tied to a chair with plastic tape. According to Ahmed, an official told him, \u201cIf you don\u2019t sign, you\u2019ll end up like that.\u201d\n\nThe other Syrian present at the time, Hussein, offered a similar account. In a phone interview from Dubai, where he escaped to after negotiating deportation to Malaysia instead of Syria, Hussein, who asked to be identified by only his first name to protect relatives still in Turkey, detailed the abuse in the same terms as Ahmed, and added that he was personally beaten by one of the guards. When the ordeal was over, both men said, the other Syrians who had arrived with them were being taken to a bus, apparently to be deported.\n\nAhmed was detained in Bink\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 for a month before being taken to another removal center in nearby K\u0131rklareli, where he said he was made to sleep outside in a courtyard together with more than 100 other detainees. The guards kept the toilets locked throughout the day, he said, so inmates had to either wait for a single 30-minute toilet break at night or relieve themselves where they were sleeping. When Ahmed fell seriously ill, he told me, he was repeatedly denied access to a doctor.\n\nAfter nine days in K\u0131rklareli, the nightmare suddenly ended. Ahmed was called in by the facility\u2019s management, asked who he was, and released when it became clear he did in fact hold temporary protection status, albeit for a district other than Istanbul. The Atlantic has seen a photo of Ahmed\u2019s identity card, as well as his release note from the removal center.\n\nThe EU has funded many of the removal centers in which refugees like Ahmed are held. As stated in budgets from 2010 and 2015, the EU financed at least 12 such facilities as part of its pre-accession funding to Turkey. And according to a 2016 report by an EU parliamentary delegation, the removal center in K\u0131rklareli in which Ahmed was held received 85 percent of its funding from the EU. The Bink\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 facility, where Syrians were forced to sign return papers, also received furniture and other equipment funded by Britain and, according to Ahmed, featured signs displaying the EU and Turkish flags.\n\nIt is hard to determine the extent to which the $6.7 billion allocated to Ankara under the 2016 EU-Turkey deal has funded similar projects. While the bulk of it went to education, health care, and direct cash support for refugees, a 2018 annual report also refers to funding for \u201ca removal center for 750 people\u201d\u2014language conspicuously replaced with the more neutral \u201cfacility for 750 people\u201d in this year\u2019s report.", "description": "Ankara is moving against Syrians in the country\u2014and the European Union bears responsibility.", "authors": ["Melvyn Ingleby"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/RTX718XU/facebook.jpg?1567016295"}
