The World In A Landmark Climate Complaint", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP\n\nUNITED NATIONS \u2014 On Tuesday, Greta Thunberg and 15 other young people filed a potentially world-changing climate complaint. On an abnormally steamy day in New York, when sweat built on the brows of the dark-suited diplomats funnelling into the United Nations for a major climate summit, the group of teens cranked up the heat even further.\n\nThey announced that they\u2019re suing five of the world\u2019s major carbon polluters on the grounds that the countries are violating their rights as children. If the suit is successful, the United Nations would classify the climate crisis as a children\u2019s rights crisis. And more importantly, it would compel Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, and Turkey \u2014 the five countries named in the suit \u2014 to work with other nations to forge binding emissions\u2019 reduction targets, a sharp change from current international efforts that have so far basically rearranged the deck chairs on the Titanic.\n\n\u201cThis is all wrong, I shouldn\u2019t be up here,\u201d Thunberg said, addressing the General Assembly and shaking with rage. \u201cI should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. You have stolen my dreams, my childhood with your empty words. We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line.\u201d\n\nThe youth climate activism movement has over the past year exploded prior notions of what\u2019s possible in the realm of climate politics. Greta Thunberg\u2019s solitary strike outside the Swedish parliament every Saturday starting last August has spawned a global movement.\n\nThis past Friday and Saturday, an estimated 4 million young adults and their supporters took to the streets around the world to demand climate action.\n\n\u201cYoung people above all \u2014 young people are providing solutions, insisting on accountability, and demanding urgent action,\u201d UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said opening the Climate Action Summit. \u201cThey are right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will rise to the challenge, we will hold those who are the most responsible for this crisis accountable, and we will make the world leaders act,\u201d Thunberg prophetically intoned at the New York strike on Friday. \u201cWe can and we will.\u201d\n\nThe suit, filed on behalf of the youth by the international law firm Hausfeld, contends that world governments are violating children\u2019s rights under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The convention drafted in 1989 is the most-signed human rights treaty ever crafted and lays out the inalienable rights of children.\n\nThey include among others, the right to life, health and peace, all with special stipulations for indigenous groups. They\u2019re also all things climate change is upending. There\u2019s ample evidence climate change is already making kids and adults sick, killing them, and uprooting their lives.\n\n\u201cSometimes in my mind I just see Ebeye sinking and a lot of people drowning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis complaint involves young people holding their guardians, us adults, to account for failing in our \u2018duty of care,\u2019\u201d Kirsten Davies, an international law expert at Macquarie University\u2019s Law School in Sydney, told Gizmodo in an email.\n\nAlexandria Villase\u00f1or, one of the plaintiffs and leaders of the U.S. climate strike movement, told Gizmodo that she came to climate activism after a cloud of toxic smoke from last year\u2019s Camp Fire descended on Davis, California, while she was visiting family. She had to end her visit early, and she left a changed person. She\u2019s been on strike outside the UN for 41 weeks and counting.\n\n\u201cI decided to be part of this case because after students have been striking we still haven\u2019t gotten the sufficient action we need,\u201d she told Gizmodo. \u201cSo we are going to the next step.\u201d\n\nEach of the 16 plaintiffs on the complaint has dealt with the stifling impacts of climate change. Ayakha Melithafa, a 17-year-old from Cape Town, had to leave with the fear of running out of water during the city\u2019s climate change-fuelled drought. Debbie Adegbile, a 12-year-old from Lagos, Nigeria, has seen her asthma become worse during increasingly severe heat waves, one of the clearest climate indicators, as well as more intense floods and risk of waterborne diseases.\n\nIn a brief provided to reporters, many of the young people \u2014 all of whom are under the age of 18 \u2014 used words like \u201cscared,\u201d \u201csad,\u201d and \u201cangry\u201d to describe their feelings about climate change and the hellscape it\u2019s creating.\n\n\u201cSometimes in my mind I just see Ebeye sinking and a lot of people drowning,\u201d Ranton Anjain, a plaintiff from the low-lying Marshall Islands, said in a statement. Ebeye, which measures just 80 acres, has an estimated population of 15,000, most of whom are under the age of 18.\n\n\u201cOur homes are being swallowed by the ocean, the places where memories are made,\u201d Carlos Manual, a 17 year old from Palau, said at a press conference announcing the suit. \u201cI am standing in front of you because I care about my generation.\u201d\n\nThe teenagers are from all over the world, including four of the five countries named in the suit. Their complaint reflects the fact that the atmosphere has no borders. Carbon pollution from the human-ignited fires in Brazil changes the climate just as much as coal plant emissions in Turkey. What the five countries all have in common is that they\u2019re part of a group of 51 nations that have signed what\u2019s called the third Optional Protocol of the convention.\n\nThat protocol allows children from anywhere around the world to file a suit against the nations that have signed onto the protocol. The complaint filed on Tuesday will now be heard by a committee of 18 international experts on children\u2019s rights. Juliane Kippenberg, the associate director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s children\u2019s rights division, told Gizmodo the suit uses a mechanism that has only been around since 2014 and \u201chas not received that much attention yet\u201d for climate relief.\n\nIf the committee finds that climate change is impeding the 16 plaintiffs\u2019 rights, then the five countries named in the suit must either exit the convention or take the radical action needed to address climate change.\n\nDavies said the case would likely be \u201csuccessful,\u201d but it also illustrates the inherent weakness of international laws, many of which were drafted before the severity of the climate crisis became clear.\n\n\u201cThe problem with most of the instruments under international law, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child, is that they were drafted prior to science affirming the threats posed by climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cTherefore, the challenges presented by climate change to the law are needing to be \u2018retrofitted\u2019 in to legal frameworks that have not been drafted for this purpose.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s best available science shows that to preserve a climate somewhat recognisable to the one that\u2019s allowed humans to thrive, governments need to rapidly wind down their emissions.\n\nThe fate of millions of children and unborn generations hangs in the balance, and how fast the globe cuts carbon emissions will decide their fate. Yet despite pledges to the Paris Agreement, carbon emissions rose globally last year.\n\nChildren have sued the government in the U.S. under a landmark case known as Juliana v. United States that\u2019s been wending its way through federal courts for years. S\u00e9bastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Centre for Environmental Law, pointed to a case filed by Torres Strait Islanders against Australia earlier this year as another precedent.\n\nThe low-lying islands they live on are being consumed by rising seas, and they filed an international human rights case against Australia for failing to reduce its emissions. Take those two cases and mash them together, and you have a rough approximation of the new case brought by Thunberg and her fellow plaintiffs.\n\n\u201cThese cases help expose the hypocrisy of countries that claim to be fully committed to the realisation of human rights yet undermine these rights through their absence of sufficient action to tackle climate change,\u201d Duyck told Gizmodo in an email.\n\nIf the case succeeds, it could set new precedents in international law. Though the five countries account for 6.12 per cent of the world\u2019s total carbon emissions, the executive summary of the complaint says that the kids are asking them to \u201cimmediately engage with other States in binding international cooperation to mitigate the climate crisis.\u201d That could (and should) include other countries not named in the complaint.\n\nThe world has a checkered history with climate treaties. The Kyoto Protocol, a treaty laid out in 1997, was binding and, as a result, the U.S. backed out of signing it. The treaty was largely a failure. In an effort to bring the U.S. on board, the more recent Paris Agreement is non-binding. That still hasn\u2019t stopped President Trump from trying to leave it, and so far, the treaty has proved to be more words than actual actions. And the commitments nations have made to reduce carbon pollution are nowhere near enough to avert catastrophic climate change.\n\nBut just because governments are failing doesn\u2019t mean citizens have to take it lying down. If the strikes have been the beginning of a new era of climate action, the complaint opens up ever greater possibilities.\n\n\u201cAs the human rights impacts of climate change are increasingly affecting people around the world,\u201d Duyck said, \u201cone can only expect that more individuals seeking to protect the rights of their communities will seek to hold states accountable for their (in)action \u2014 including through the use of international human rights bodies.\u201d", "description": "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 On Tuesday, Greta Thunberg and 15 other young people filed a potentially world-changing climate complaint.
