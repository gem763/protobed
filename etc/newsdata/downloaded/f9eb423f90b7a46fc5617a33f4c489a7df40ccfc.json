I talked to him the other day. He is doing good,\u201d Haddish said.\n\nLast month, Hart was hospitalized and underwent surgery after he suffered \u201cmajor back injuries\u201d when his Plymouth Barracuda veered off the road and landed in a ditch.\n\nThe comedian was hurt after the vehicle\u2019s driver, friend Jared Black, lost control and crashed through wooden fencing just before 1 a.m. on Mulholland Highway in Malibu, a spokesperson for the California Highway Patrol previously said.\n\nRELATED: Kevin Hart Is Out of the Hospital and Being Treated at a Rehab Facility Following Car Crash\n\nHart\u2019s wife, Eniko Parrish, told TMZ reporters outside the hospital days later that Hart is doing \u201cgreat\u201d and is expected to fully recover.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gonna be just fine. He\u2019s good, everybody\u2019s good.

We spoke to his pediatrician and he\u2019s doing very well. He\u2019s bummed he couldn\u2019t be here, as you know, but l love the guy. He\u2019s one of my best friends.
