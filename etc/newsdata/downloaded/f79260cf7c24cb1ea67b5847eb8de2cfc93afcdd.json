That caused gold to lose some safe-haven appeal.\n\nAsian markets were mixed today, with Chinese stocks underperforming following the release of weak inflation data. Australian stocks also fell on weak business confidence.\n\nSeparately, reports that the flood of China\u2019s central bank buying of gold is drying up also put pressure on gold prices.\n\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China raised its gold holdings to 62.45 million ounces in August from 62.26 million ounces a month earlier, according to data on its website at the weekend. However, that represented purchases of only 5.91 tons in the month, after an average of 11.75 tons a month since December.\n\nDespite the fall today, the precious metal has risen about 19% this year through mid-August. Prospect for lower interest rates and safe-haven demand amid slowing global economic growth were cited as tailwinds for gold.", "description": "Gold Prices Slip on Increasing Appetite for Risk", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEF410GC_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
