Other C.E.O.s Should Follow.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s clear to us that the status quo is unacceptable,\u201d Mr. McMillon wrote to employees.\n\nYears ago Walmart imposed age limits and background checks on gun sales that go beyond federal law. For example, the company requires a \u201cgreen light\u201d on a background check \u2014 meaning that it receives an affirmative go-ahead from the government \u2014 but federal law allows retailers to sell the weapon if the background check has not been returned by the government within three business days. Walmart also videotapes the sale at the register, which is also not required by federal law. And Mr. McMillon\u2019s new policy of discouraging customers\u2019 open carrying of weapons in his stores, even when the applicable state law allows for it, is a demonstration for business leaders that common sense can prevail.\n\nMr. McMillon said he wanted to share the company\u2019s processes with other retailers. \u201cWe are exploring ways to share the technical specifications and compliance controls for our proprietary firearms sales technology platform,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis system navigates the tens of millions of possible combinations of federal, state and local laws, regulations and licensing requirements that come into effect based on where the firearm is being sold and who is purchasing it.\u201d\n\nCritics will argue that Mr. McMillon isn\u2019t going far enough, and it is true that he could have gone further, for example by endorsing a ban on assault weapons rather than simply calling for a congressional debate. Another argument is that Walmart should stop selling guns altogether.\n\nBut discontinuing all gun sales would only undermine the company\u2019s role in helping develop more responsible processes throughout the industry. My open letter to him suggested he continue to sell some guns because it would give him leverage over the system in a way that would be impossible otherwise.\n\nProminent gun control like former Representative Gabrielle Giffords congratulated Mr. McMillon.\n\n\u201cWalmart\u2019s action is another sign that the private sector has had enough with America\u2019s gun violence crisis,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cAddressing a problem this big requires leaders from across American society to be part of the solution. Walmart\u2019s announcement should be applauded by all Americans, and I\u2019m hopeful it will inspire elected leaders to follow in their footsteps.\u201d\n\nHopefully the inspiration isn\u2019t confined to politicians \u2014 or to Mr. McMillon. Which C.E.O. will be next?", "description": "Doug McMillon, Walmart\u2019s chief executive, said the company would stop selling certain types of guns and ammunition.
