When Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon set out to create The Morning Show, #MeToo hadn\u2019t happened yet. But when it did, the trajectory of the AppleTV+ show, set to debut November 1, completely shifted.\n\n\u201cOnce #MeToo happened, obviously the conversation drastically changed,\u201d Aniston said at an October 13 press junket for the show in West Hollywood, California. \u201cWe all sat and thought about what the tone would be. We wanted it to be raw and honest, and vulnerable and messy, and not black and white.\u201d\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nWitherspoon, dressed to channel an anchorwoman in a pink pantsuit and statement-making dark-framed glasses, added, \u201cAs we were all stumbling along trying to figure out what it this new narrative, the show was writing itself. The news was helping it.\u201d\n\nAniston explained that she based her own character on a \u201cDiane Sawyer kind of archetype,\u201d noting that she was able to sit with Sawyer and ask numerous questions to inform the role.\n\nWitherspoon was inspired by the likes of Katie Couric and Meredith Viera. \u201cWe\u2019ve been so lucky to get to know a lot of these women who were so open about their lives,\u201d she said, with a tone of seriousness and respect for the women in the real-life roles. \u201cThey\u2019re excited for some truth to be told as well.\u201d\n\nWitherspoon said that writer Kerry Ehrin \u201cdid a great job of creating really nuanced and different characters that are established in the pilot. They all come from different backgrounds, different levels of success, they all come from different motivations and different ideologies, and they\u2019re all highly motivated. And they\u2019re all working at cross purposes at all times \u2014 so when they collide, it\u2019s fascinating.\u201d\n\nThe Morning Show set out to capture the zeitgeist of the #MeToo moment, which is a tall order. \u201cIt\u2019s about this moment when a whole construct explodes,\u201d Witherspoon said. \u201cIt starts so dismantle slowly over the 10 episodes and then it culminates in a gigantic seismic shift In the corporate culture of this one network \u2014 which is extraordinary and reflects what\u2019s happening in the real world.\u201d\n\nShe explained that writer Ehrin\u2019s approach to \u201ctaking real life and synthesizing it into fiction and art\u201d creates a vehicle through which \u201cwe start to understand ourselves.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Ehrin underscored that her writing decisions were informed not just by the movement itself, but by the complexity of it \u2014 and indeed of life itself, in particular the female experience. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to talk about morning news and not talk about #MeToo,\u201d Ehrin said. \u201cIt would be negligent. It is actually just nuanced.\u201d\n\nThe The Morning Show gathering also provided an opportunity for Carrell to voice his admiration for Aniston in a way that seemed to sincerely surprise \u2014 and charm \u2014 the actress.\n\nRecalling the first day he saw her at work, on the set of Bruce Almighty, he remembered having a bit of a fanboy moment. \u201cI saw her one day across the way in a crowd scene,\u201d he said. \u201cI was so excited just to be on set with her; to get to be on set with her was the coolest thing ever.\u201d\n\nAniston seemed legitimately moved. \u201cWow, I just blushed,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was the sweetest thing ever.\u201d\n\nCarrell\u2019s reaction to working with Aniston for the first time was a bit of a departure from Witherspoon\u2019s own memory of working with Aniston for the first time: She recently noted she was downright \u201cnervous\u201d to encounter Aniston on the set of Friends when she arrived to play her sister as a 23-year-old new mom in the \u201990s.\n\nAniston and Witherspoon star in The Morning Show alongside a gaggle of other fantastic actors, including Steve Carrell, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Billy Crudup, N\u00e9stor Carbonell, and Mark Duplass. The scripted series will be one of the first to debut on the new streaming service.\n\nIf you\u2019re anything like us, you\u2019re definitely going to want to watch it unfold \u2014 yes, for the entertainment value provided by the incredibly talented actors, but also for the way it holds the mirror up to some of the most salient real-life dramas du jour.\n\nThe show, based on Brian Stelter\u2019s book Top of the Morning, focuses on the cutthroat world of morning news broadcasting, and it\u2019s not hard to imagine that the show\u2019s central conflicts are pulled right from real-life headlines. Specifically, in presenting the experience of women in the newsroom environment, the show deals with many themes that overlap the #MeToo movement. And \u2014 sigh \u2014 it will probably get us to subscribe to AppleTV+. How can we resist?\n\nBest of SheKnows\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.
