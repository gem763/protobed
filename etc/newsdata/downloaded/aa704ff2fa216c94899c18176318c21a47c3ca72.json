That is why a different experience, the white experience, is centered in this talk,\u201d she said.\n\nFollowing the event, Crucet praised some of the \u201cvery amazing, brilliant students\u201d she met.\n\n\u201cAt the signing, we hugged & cried,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cI\u2018m happy to know them and also legit worried for their safety.\u201d\n\nOther students had a different reaction and used photos and videos to troll Crucet on Twitter. One student sent a photo of ripped pages to Crucet over Twitter.\n\n\u201cEnjoy this picture of your book!\u201d a tweet captured by the George-Anne said. \u201cHave a nice night, Jennine. :-)\u201d\n\nThat tweet and others collected by the paper were later deleted. That particular account, from a student identifying as Caitlin, appears to be entirely deleted.\n\nCrucet, an associate professor at the University of Nebraska, said in a statement Friday that during the event and at the book signing that followed many students told her they had seen their own experiences reflected in the story of the novel\u2019s protagonist.\n\n\u201cTo think of those students watching as a group of their peers burned that story\u2014effectively erasing them on the campus they are expected to think of as a safe space\u2014feels devastating,\u201d she said.\n\nThe university is not planning to discipline any students for the burning incident, said Jennifer Wise, a university spokeswoman.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s within the students\u2019 First Amendment rights, book burning does not align with Georgia Southern\u2019s values nor does it encourage the civil discourse and debate of ideas,\u201d the university said in a statement.\n\nCrucet said on Twitter another event scheduled for Thursday was canceled \u201cbecause the administration said they could not guarantee my safety or the safety of its students on campus because of open-carry laws.\u201d\n\n[Education Department says it will fund Middle East studies program after all]\n\nWise said the event \u2014 a discussion with some first-year classes \u2014 was canceled at the request of Crucet\u2019s representative.\n\nOther students were dismayed over the book burning, a violent rejection of speech most notoriously associated with Nazi Germany.\n\n\u201cIt makes me feel like we are being represented really badly. It makes me feel like these people make us look as a school and even as a freshman class really ignorant and racist,\u201d Carlin Blalock, a freshman music education student, told the George-Anne.\n\n\u201cJust seeing it happen, I know they didn\u2019t read the book or they didn\u2019t care. It\u2019s so disrespectful to even think about doing anything to that book because that\u2019s her life story. I wish I could have been there to do something about it.\u201d\n\nPEN America, a speech and literature advocacy group, said the book burning was \u201cdeeply\u201d disturbing in a statement.\n\n\u201cBook burning has a long history as a tactic to intimidate, silence, and denigrate the value of intellectual exchange,\u201d said Jonathan Friedman, the group\u2019s campus free speech director.\n\n\u201cStudents have the right to exercise their own freedom of expression and book burning is also a protected act of expression. But this symbolic gesture aimed not just to reject or refute ideas but to obliterate the very paper on which they were written.\u201d\n\nFriedman also said the university\u2019s statement did not go far enough in response.\n\n\u201cIt behooves the university to educate its students about why book burning is so inimical to open discourse and free expression.\u201d\n\nCrucet concluded her Friday statement on the incident by saying that her \u201cbook began as an act of love and an attempt at deeper understanding.\"\n\n\u201cI hope GSU can act from the same place and work to affirm the humanity of those students who might understandably feel unsafe in the aftermath of the event and the book burning, and that the campus continues the difficult and necessary conversation that began in that auditorium.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nFast-moving wildfire burns homes, prompts mandatory evacuations in Los Angeles\n\nA historically black college in Maryland is growing \u2014 by enrolling Hispanic, white and international students\n\nWhat does it take to combat intolerance?
