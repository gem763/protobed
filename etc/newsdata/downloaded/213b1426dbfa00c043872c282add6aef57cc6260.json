My life was out of control.'\n\nMich\u00e9 Solomon, 21, from Cape Town, was shocked when she took snap with friend from school called Cassidy Nurse, who was three years younger but looked identical to her\n\nMich\u00e9 was just three days old when she was taken from the hospital by Lavona Solomon, and would only reunite with her biological family 17 years later (pictured, with her biological mother Celeste)\n\nMich\u00e9 was a 17-year-old high school student when classmates started telling her about a girl several years younger who she looked 'identical' to.\n\nUnaware they were related, the girls struck up a close friendship, despite their age difference, and soon became inseparable.\n\nShe said she had felt an instant connection to the younger girl Cassidy, and that the two joked about being sisters in the school corridors.\n\nBut the true connection didn't come to light until Cassidy showed her parents a selfie they had taken at school.\n\nWhen Cassidy's parents, Celeste and Morne Nurse, saw the photo they asked to know when Mich\u00e9's birthday was.\n\nMorne met the girl, who told him her birthday was the same day as Zephany and he went to the police with his suspicions.\n\nA few weeks later, Mich\u00e9 was called to the headmasters office and told that the woman she believed to be her birth mother had in fact stolen her from hospital 17 years earlier.\n\nAnd as first Mich\u00e9 said she was skeptical of the story, but she agreed to a DNA test which proved conclusively that the Nurses were her parents.\n\nMorne Nurse and Celeste Nurse, the biological parents of the South African born kidnapped child Zephany Nurse, embrace each other after court proceedings in Cape Town\n\nMich\u00e9 was further crushed when the police went on to arrest her mother, Lavona Solomon, and accused the woman she believed to be her mother of walking into the hospital and taking her from her real parents as a baby.\n\nShe said Lavona's arrest had 'broken' her, and that she was overwhelmed at the thought that Lavona was not her mother.\n\nShe was further devastated by the thought that the mother who had raised her had lied to her.\n\nLavona is thought to have concealed a miscarriage and then faked her pregnancy before taking Zephany home from the hospital (pictured arriving at Cape Town High Court at her trial)\n\nIt is thought Lavona concealed a miscarriage and then faked the rest of her pregnancy before stealing Zephany from the hospital, bringing the baby home and pretending she had given birth alone.\n\nAnd although Celeste and Morne Nurse had gone on to welcome three more children, including Cassidy, they had never stopped holding out hope that one day they would be reunited with their daughter.\n\nDespite being divorced, they even celebrated her birthday every year \u2013 not knowing their daughter was living just 5km from them.\n\nMich\u00e9 then faced the daunting prospect of meeting her biological parents, something which she said she had mixed feelings about.\n\nThe case of Zephany Nurse The case of missing Zephany Nurse was one of South Africa\u2019s biggest and longest running news stories. It was likened to South Africa's Madeleine McCann throughout the trial in 2016. It was found that Lavona Solomon took Zephany Nurse from Groote Schuur hospital in Cape Town in April 1997 while her mother was in bed recovering from a C-section. She told the court she hid a miscarriage from her husband and had bought the baby for \u00a350 at a train station from a woman who promised to help her with an adoption. Her lies meant her betrayed husband brought the baby up as his own, unbeknown to him his wife\u2019s dark secret. Mich\u00e9 only learned of her true identity after an extraordinary twist in the lifelong hunt for her \u2013 when she made friends with a girl at school who turned out to be her sister.\n\nDespite an emotional reunion with Celeste and Morne, she said she 'felt nothing' about them, but suggested she felt it would be 'a shame' for them as they'd been through a lot.\n\nLavona Solomon's trial at the high court in Cape Town began in August 2015, with both Mich\u00e9 and her biological parents there to hear her testimony.\n\nIn court, Lavona gave far-fetched evidence about how she was handed Zephany by a mysterious woman at a busy train station in Cape Town.\n\nIt was dismissed by Judge John Hope as 'a fairytale' which 'should be treated with the contempt it deserves'.\n\nMorne discovered his missing daughter after noticing how similar Cassidy looked to a friend - and after establishing when Mich\u00e9's birthday was, he went to the police with his suspicions (pictured, arriving at court in 2016)\n\nShe denied she had dressed as a nurse to get onto the maternity ward at the Groote Schurr hospital where Zephany was snatched in April 1997, despite being identified by eye witnesses following her arrest.\n\nIn 2016, Lavona Solomon was sentenced to 10 years in jail for kidnapping, fraud and violating the Children's Act.\n\nMich\u00e9 said she was crushed by what happened, explaining: 'I felt like death was happening to me. I was like, \"How am I gonna cope?\".\n\nMich\u00e9's biological mother Celeste Nurse had never stopped holding out hope that she would one day find her daughter (pictured, at the court case in 2016)\n\n'How am I going to get through life without the mother that I had every day in my life?'\n\nMich\u00e9 was left devastated by her mother's incarceration, and said she struggled to form a relationship with her biological family.\n\nShe admitted she even 'hated' them for taking her mother away.\n\nDesperate for answers, Mich\u00e9 went on to visit her mother in prison, and begged her to tell her what had happened.\n\nShe said she asked her mother: 'By knowing I'm not your blood - that I actually belong to someone else, and that you've robbed them of possibilities and changed my whole destiny - hurts me.\n\nCeleste celebrated her missing daughter's birthday every year (pictured, outside Western Cape High Court)\n\n'How am I supposed to believe your word when you've lied to me, saying that I am your child?'\n\nBut Lavona simply told her that she would know what had happened 'one day'.\n\nShe still visits Lavona in prison in Worcester, which is about 120km from where she lives, and says she wishes time would 'hurry up' because she is waiting for her mother to come home.", "description": "Mich\u00e9 Solomon, 21, from Cape Town, took a snap with friend from school called Cassidy Nurse, who was three years younger but looked identical to her.
