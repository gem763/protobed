Media praise Elizabeth Warren -- and her crowds", "language": "en", "text": "Elizabeth Warren drew an impressive 20,000 people for an anti-corruption speech the other night in the liberal enclave surrounding Manhattan\u2019s Washington Square Park.\n\nCue the media swoon.\n\nIn fact, as Warren has been drawing big crowds, delivering sharp debate performances and inching up in the polls, she has drawn almost no negative press\u2014in marked contrast to Joe Biden.\n\nAnd the toughest interviewer she\u2019s faced has been liberal comedian Stephen Colbert.\n\nOne might even get the impression that most of the media would prefer that an ultra-progressive woman win the nomination as opposed to an old, occasionally stumbling, more moderate white guy who\u2019s been a Washington figure for well over four decades.\n\nThere\u2019s no question the Massachusetts senator is the hot candidate right now. The WP has a piece saying she\u2019s demonstrated she can \u201cmatch the spectacle of Trump, right down to the large, cheering throngs.\u201d\n\nTRUMP TAUNTS TIMES, REPORTERS BLAME EDITORS ON KAVANAUGH\n\nThe president, known for bragging about his crowd size since his inauguration, took a swipe at Warren, telling reporters that that \u201canybody\u201d can attract crowds \u201cstanding in the middle of Manhattan in the most densely populated area of the country.\u201d\n\nBig crowds used to be written off as just the party faithful turning out, but now not so much. They can signify excitement and enthusiasm.\n\nTo me, what\u2019s more important than her crowds is the way Warren lingers and poses for selfies with anyone who wants one\u2014for an exhausting four hours after the New York speech. That\u2019s a personal touch that makes her approachable, and it\u2019s hard to imagine Bernie Sanders doing something similar.\n\nBut the fact remains that Warren, whose embrace of Medicare for All means she would abolish private insurance for 150 million Americans, may be too liberal to win a general election. With a few exceptions, media outlets rarely focus on her potential vulnerabilities or such controversies as her past work for the kind of big corporations she now bashes.\n\nAn MSNBC interview with Rachel Maddow on Tuesday night was a lovefest. Maddow praised Warren\u2019s crowds and selfies and asked such questions as, \u201cHow do you map that model of social change, of big structural change?\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Colbert pressed Warren about her health insurance plan on the \u201cLate Show.\u201d She has successfully deflected these questions at the last two debates, with moderators simply giving up and moving on.\n\nColbert, a liberal who detests Donald Trump, has turned out to be adept at questioning Democratic candidates, sometimes with humorous barbs. He challenged Biden on his constant gaffes as well.\n\nHe told the candidate that she keeps being challenged in debates about how she\u2019ll pay for her health plan, paused for effect, and said: \u201cHow are you going to pay for it? Are you going to raise the middle-class taxes?\u201d\n\nWarren reframed the question, as she always does: \u201cCosts are going to go up for the wealthiest Americans, for big corporations--\u201d\n\nHe asked again: Will middle-class taxes go up?\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\n\u201cWell, here\u2019s the thing,\u201d Warren began.\n\n\u201cNo, here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019ve listened to these answers a few times before,\u201d Colbert said, before suggesting she simply defend the tax hike.\n\nNancy Pelosi, meanwhile, explicitly came out yesterday against Medicare for All, telling CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer that the more feasible path for Democrats is expanding ObamaCare. The speaker knows a land mine when she sees one.\n\nThe chatter among pundits now is that Warren could overtake Biden, especially if she wins Iowa and then her neighboring state of New Hampshire. In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC poll, she trails Biden by just 6 points and is statistically tied among white voters, 28 percent to Biden\u2019s 27 percent.\n\nHer problem is that Biden crushes her, 49 to 13 percent, among black voters, who are crucial in South Carolina and then in the big industrial states. She just doesn\u2019t have the same kind of connection as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president.\n\nIf Warren keeps surging toward the nomination, the press at some point will be forced to give her tougher scrutiny. But for now, they\u2019re largely content to chronicle her rise and marvel at the size of her crowds.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren drew an impressive 20,000 people for an anti-corruption speech the other night in the liberal enclave surrounding Manhattan\u2019s Washington Square Park.\u00a0Cue the media swoon.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/18/694940094001_6087501170001_6087499630001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
