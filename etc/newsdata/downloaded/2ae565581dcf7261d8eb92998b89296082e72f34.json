The Washington Mystics hope to have Elena Delle Donne back for both of them.\n\nJonquel Jones had 32 points and 18 rebounds, and the Sun took advantage of Delle Donne\u2019s early exit to beat the Mystics 99-87 in Game 2 of the WNBA Finals on Tuesday night.\n\nThe series is tied heading into Game 3 on Sunday at Connecticut\u2019s Mohegan Sun Arena.\n\n\u201cThis was our goal, to steal a win on their floor,\u201d guard Jasmine Thomas said. \u201cAnd now we get to go home and play two in a row.\u201d\n\nAlyssa Thomas added 21 points and 12 rebounds for the Sun, who dominated the paint after the 6-foot-5 Delle Donne departed in the first quarter with back spasms.\n\nThe recently crowned league MVP, who averaged 19.5 points and 8.2 rebounds this season, will have an MRI Wednesday.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just had, kind of ongoing, late-in-the-season tightness,\u201d said Mystics coach Mike Thibault. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to treat it and it\u2019s responded pretty well. But it\u2019s the one nightmare I\u2019ve had the last month, is seeing her lying on her back.\u201d\n\nBASEBALL\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Mets slugger Pete Alonso visited the National September 11 Memorial & Museum to donate the custom cleats and baseball bat honoring first responders that he used in a game on the 18th anniversary of the terrorist attacks.\n\nAlonso presented the equipment to Alice M. Greenwald, the president of the museum. He said \u201cit means the world\u201d that the memorial wanted the gear for its permanent collection.\n\n\u201cJust being here in New York, I just wanted to show every bit of gratitude I could,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cNot just for the first responders, but for the families as well who were directly impacted. You guys will not be forgotten.\u201d\n\nThe 24-year-old rookie surprised his teammates with customized spikes to wear during a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks, which the Mets won by scoring nine runs on 11 hits. He had spent weeks jotting down their shoe sizes, preferred brands and styles, then hired a company to paint them red, white and blue with lettering for first-responder units.\n\nGreenwald thanked Alonso for \u201csuch a meaningful gesture of remembrance and respect\u201d and called it an \u201cextraordinary gift.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey might smell a little,\u201d Alonso warned. He added that it was \u201cseriously an honor.\u201d\n\nCOLLEGE SPORTS\n\nUCLA football coach Chip Kelly was succinct when asked his opinion of California\u2019s new law that would allow college athletes to be paid for the use of their names and likenesses.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what we think. It\u2019s the law,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nThe Pac-12 Conference has condemned the law, which was signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday. Coaches across the league were uncertain about what it might mean for them, especially in terms of recruiting. Four of the league\u2019s teams are located in California: Stanford, Cal, UCLA and USC.\n\nThe law does not take effect until 2023. The schools would not pay the players for their likenesses, but players could be compensated by outside companies. Other states are considering similar legislation.\n\nNBA\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Former NBA GM and league executive Rod Thorn has been hired by the Washington Wizards as a senior adviser to general manager Tommy Sheppard.\n\nThorn will help Sheppard in free agency, the draft and other basketball operations matters.\n\nThorn was a general manager for the Chicago Bulls - including when they drafted Michael Jordan - the New Jersey Nets and Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nHe was executive vice president of basketball operations for the NBA from 1986-2000.\n\nThorn was drafted by the Baltimore Bullets in 1963 and played nine years in the league and later worked as a coach.\n\nNHL\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - San Jose Sharks forward Evander Kane has been suspended for the first three games of the season for abuse of an official.\n\nThe punishment comes after Kane had a run-in with Vegas\u2019 Deryk Engelland in a preseason game on Sunday.\n\nKane responded with a slash after being cross-checked by Engelland. His stick also made contact with linesman Kiel Murchison. Murchison later grabbed Kane\u2019s jersey to split the two players up and the two fell to the ice. Kane then appeared to shove the linesman as he got up. Kane was given a game misconduct for the play.\n\nThe Sharks open the season Wednesday night in Vegas and then host the Golden Knights on Friday night. Kane will also miss a game in Nashville on Oct. 8.\n\nKane will forfeit more than $112,000 based on his annual salary because of the suspension.\n\nCOLLEGE BASKETBALL\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Rutgers\u2019 C. Vivian Stringer will receive the John R. Wooden Legends of Coaching honor next spring.\n\nThe award is given annually to college basketball coaches who exemplify the late UCLA legend\u2019s standard of success and personal integrity.\n\nShe will be recognized on April 10 at the College Basketball Awards in Los Angeles.\n\nStringer is the fourth woman to earn the honor, joining Muffet McGraw of Notre Dame, Stanford\u2019s Tara VanDerveer, and the late Pat Summitt of Tennessee.\n\nThe 71-year-old Stringer has spent the last 24 years as Rutgers\u2019 women\u2019s coach. Last season, she became the fifth coach in NCAA Division I women\u2019s history to surpass 1,000 career victories. In 2009, Stringer was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nPrevious winners of the award include Roy Williams of Kansas, Mike Krzyzewski of Duke, and the late Dean Smith of North Carolina.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "WNBA", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": ""}
