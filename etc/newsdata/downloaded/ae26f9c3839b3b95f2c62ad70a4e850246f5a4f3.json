REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan/File Photo\n\nGojek said on Monday its president Andre Soelistyo and other co-founder Kevin Aluwi would replace Makarim in running unlisted Gojek.\n\nThe Indonesian company, valued at $10 billion, raised over $1 billion earlier this year from backers including Alphabet\u2019s Google (GOOGL.O) and Chinese tech giants Tencent (0700.HK) and JD (JD.O).\n\nA spokesman for Gojek told Reuters on Tuesday that Makarim will keep his stake but not have any advisory or executive role at the company. Gojek declined to comment on the size of Makarim\u2019s stake.\n\nInvestors say that Widodo\u2019s choice of Makarim, a graduate of Brown University and Harvard Business School, is a welcome signal that the president will focus on developing the booming technology sector in Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy.\n\nThe Indonesian leader has repeatedly pledged to invest in bridging the acute skills shortage faced by the country\u2019s startups.\n\nWhile Indonesia\u2019s Internet economy is forecast to grow to more than $100 billion by 2025, it produces only 278 engineers per million people a year, according to consultancy A.T. Kearney.\n\nDeparting communications minister Rudiantara previously told Reuters that he expected the next Indonesian technology \u201cunicorn\u201d to come from the education sector due to legislation that mandates the government has spend 20% of the national budget on education.\n\nGojek, which acts as one-stop app through which users can make online payments and order food and services, is one of Indonesia\u2019s five unicorns - companies that have reached $1 billion in valuation without tapping the stock markets.\n\nThe others are travel site Traveloka, market places Bukalapak and Tokopedia, and Grab-backed fintech firm OVO, which competes with Gojek\u2019s own payments platform Gopay for the top spot in Indonesia\u2019s multi-billion dollar online payments market.\n\nRudiantara said he believes that five-year old startup Ruangguru, Indonesia\u2019s largest online tutoring platform, will join their ranks within one to two years.\n\n(Corrects 4th paragraph to add dropped letter)", "description": "Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Wednesday named 35-year-old Nadiem Makarim, the co-founder and ex-chief executive of ride-hailing and payments firm Gojek, as education and culture minister.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1443953038&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M032", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
