Other state leaders have also met with the group, including former Premier Zhu Rongji and Vice President Wang Qishan, it added.\n\nThe Chinese market is an important part of Apple's business, providing around $3 billion in revenue each month for the iPhone manufacturer. The iPhone maker also has a large portion of its manufacturing base and supply chain based in China.\n\nRead more: China has Apple by the iPhones\n\nCook's decision to become chairman of the school's advisory comes as Apple has drawn fire for its recent activities in China. Earlier this month, Apple ripped HKmap.live from its app store which sparked criticism from various US senators and congresspeople, who issued a letter calling for the app to be reinstated.\n\n\"We urge you in the strongest terms to reverse course, to demonstrate that Apple puts values above market access, and to stand with the brave men and women fighting for basic rights and dignity in Hong Kong,\" the letter said.\n\nThe letter also pointed out that Apple has censored over 2,200 apps in China, including removing VPN apps from its Chinese app store two years ago and apps designed to help the Uyghur and Tibetan people.\n\nCook will be the advisory board's chairman for three years, taking over the position from Jim Breyer, the founder and chief executive of Breyer Capital, Tsinghua University said in a statement on Friday.\n\nIn the statement, Cook said he would work with board members to promote the development of the university's economics and management school and to lead the effort in building it into a \"world-class school\".\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "It follows Apple drawing fire from US and Hong Kong government officials for its activities in China.", "authors": ["Campbell Kwan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/21/142c93c7-f6cb-4e7a-837f-2e20935721bc/thumbnail/770x578/fa18e4386c879f6106cbefb6c5e0cabb/1571668051108064206.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
