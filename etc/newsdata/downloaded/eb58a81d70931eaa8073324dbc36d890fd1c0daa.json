Pence\u2019s European schedule was hastily rearranged, they said\u2026\n\n\u201cWe followed normal protocol,\u201d Marc Short, chief of staff to the vice president, told reporters on Tuesday. He added that while Trump had recommended staying at Doonbeg, he didn\u2019t demand it.\n\nStill, Democrats seized on Pence\u2019s decision to stay at Trump\u2019s golf club as the latest example of the president benefiting from taxpayer dollars at his businesses. Trump twice over the weekend visited his golf club in Sterling, Virginia, and last month said he was strongly considering holding next year\u2019s G-7 summit at his Doral golf resort in Miami.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bloomberg.Com News Articles U-S-S-Pence-Faces-Row-Over-Stay-At-Trump-S-Irish-Resort"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
