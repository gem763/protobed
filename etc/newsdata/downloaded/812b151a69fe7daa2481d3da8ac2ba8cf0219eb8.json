President Trump\u2019s response to Turkey\u2019s incursion in Syria brings to mind his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. On both occasions, his words wrought chaos and confusion. Then, as now, he would have done himself \u2014 and the nation \u2014 a favor if he had acted more deliberately from the start.\n\nIf you\u2019ll recall, Trump\u2019s Helsinki press conference with Putin was hard to stomach. They joked around like fraternity brothers \u2014 a display completely at odds with U.S. policy, which has no patience for Putin\u2019s record of destabilizing actions.\n\nAfterwards, officials raced to reassure that American policies hadn\u2019t changed. Trump\u2019s display of camaraderie was his way of offering the Russians a diplomatic off-ramp, the same kind of familiarity he has extended to North Korea, China and even Iran. The intended message: He was willing to make nice, if they reciprocated by not impinging on U.S. vital interests.\n\nNow we have the president\u2019s tweets over Syria, which certainly seemed to greenlight the Turkish incursion. Much like the Helsinki press conference, they provoked confusion and outrage, leaving a lot of clean-up work to be done.\n\nThat process is underway. The president has warned Turkey that sanctions are likely and dispatched the vice president, secretary of state and national security adviser to the region. The administration also announced that it would maintain some military presence in Syria as it presses for a ceasefire between the Kurds and the Turks.\n\nAs the initial explosion of outrage settles, it now appears that the administration never did greenlight the Turkish incursion. In fact, it advised Turkey against it.\n\nThe U.S. troop withdrawal was not to accommodate the Turks. It was simply a response to fast-unfolding events on the ground \u2014 the most expeditious way to get them out of the middle of a shooting war between the Turks and Kurds.\n\nThat fight clearly serves no U.S. interests. Moving our troops out allows them to continue to address other American concerns in the region: keeping ISIS from rebounding, blocking the expansion of the Iranian threat, and stemming another destabilizing flood of refugees.\n\nYet none of this was apparent from Trump\u2019s initial response to the crisis.\n\nWhat the occasion really called for was a sober speech from the Oval Office explaining to the American people how we got where we are; what was going on; and what he would do to protect our interests. It\u2019s something Trump has shown he can do, yet he did not.Why?\n\nOn the public stage, there are two Donald Trumps. The first is the \"showman.\"His outsized personality, his ability to explain in a terse, irreverent style, connects well with many Americans. It\u2019s what won him the election and what, in part, keeps his popularity ratings steady despite incessant attacks by critics and a hostile media.\n\nThe other Trump is the serious Trump \u2014 the leader who makes big, bold decisions that are good for the country: pushing for tax cuts, cutting regulations, standing up to China, and protecting vital U.S. interests abroad. That kind of leadership is another reason why his popularity has held.\n\nBut the Helsinki and Syria incidents show the problems that arise when the president conflates the two Trumps.\n\nIn response to Turkey\u2019s announcement that it was going after the Kurds, Showman Trump blurted out that he has no interest in \u201cendless wars.\u201d Well, of course not.Who does? That phrase is just empty rhetoric. Without elucidation, it \u2014 like another presidential catchphrase, \u201cAmerica First\u201d \u2014 doesn\u2019t tell us much about actual U.S. policy.\n\nWhen the president first tweeted his response to Turkey, many of his supporters cheered, implicitly trusting him to do the right thing. But most Americans \u2014 and many of our friends and allies \u2014 were befuddled. And that\u2019s on Trump.\n\nTrump is the president of all Americans and the leader of the free world. On matters of great seriousness that affect all of us, we need to hear the serious Trump.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard him before. Serious Trump gave a powerful addresses when announcing our withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. He did it again when announcing that U.S. forces would remain in Afghanistan. He\u2019s given powerful speeches in Warsaw and at the United Nations.\n\nHe should have given another one last week.\n\nThis is a lesson that President Trump must learn and remember. Others will rise up to test America\u2019s resolve. They will challenge our interests. They will threaten our peace, prosperity and security. Trump, like any good American president, will stand and protect. In times of grave trouble he also needs to speak to us \u2014 not tweet at us.", "description": "Talk about d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!
