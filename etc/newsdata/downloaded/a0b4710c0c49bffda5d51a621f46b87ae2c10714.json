Photo: Davidoff Studios Photography/Getty Images\n\nIn early August, a federal appeals court unsealed around 2,000 pages of explosive court documents pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s alleged child sex-trafficking ring, which were replete with damning allegations against the accused sex trafficker and his alleged madam. Although Epstein, who was facing federal sex-trafficking charges at the time, has since been found dead by suicide, one of his accusers is still fighting to have the remaining documents unsealed. And, according to the New York Post, one of the men potentially named in the court papers seems to be panicking.\n\nIn a surprise motion filed on Tuesday, a man identified as John Doe asked Manhattan federal judge Loretta Preska to protect the identity of anyone who might appear in the remaining sealed court documents. Doe\u2019s reasoning for keeping the names private: He lacks \u201cspecific knowledge\u201d about the documents, and worries that revealing the accused might damage the \u201creputational interests\u201d of those named in them. (That last insight is certainly true!)\n\nThe documents in question date back to a 2015 case against Maxwell, in which Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein\u2019s alleged sex slaves, claimed that Maxwell had defamed her by calling her a liar. (In 2009, Giuffre alleged in a lawsuit that Maxwell had recruited her into Epstein\u2019s sex ring, which Maxwell repeatedly called \u201centirely false.\u201d) The near-2,000 pages related to the case that were unsealed in August only comprise a portion of the docket from that civil case; just earlier today, Giuffre and her lawyers appeared in court to continue their fight to unseal the rest.\n\nIn the motion, lawyers for Doe described the contents of the sealed documents as a \u201crange of allegations of sexual acts involving [Giuffre] and non-parties to this litigation, some famous, some not; the identities of non-parties who either allegedly engaged in sexual acts with [Giuffre] or who allegedly facilitated such acts.\u201d\n\nIndeed, if the remaining documents are as explosive as the first portion to be unsealed \u2014 which contained the allegation that Epstein and Maxwell held a 15-year-old girl hostage on the billionaire\u2019s private island, among others \u2014 Doe is right to be worried. Per the New York Post, Sigrid McCawley, a member of Giuffre\u2019s legal team, said they only want to conceal \u201cSocial Security numbers, the names of minor victims and any confidential medical information,\u201d which doesn\u2019t bode well for Doe. Even Maxwell\u2019s legal team appears to be panicking, as her lawyer said in court that \u201chundreds of people\u201d could be implicated in the documents.\n\nSounds like all the more reason to unseal them!\n\nStay in touch.
