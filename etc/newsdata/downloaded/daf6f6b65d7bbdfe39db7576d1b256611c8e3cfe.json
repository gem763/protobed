These attorneys general have a unique vantage point at the intersection of law enforcement and public policy\u2014but on this issue, they\u2019re completely wrong.\n\nThe loophole, broad-based categorical eligibility, or BBCE, has given benefits to 5 million recipients who are ineligible under federal guidelines, including some millionaires.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the attorneys general who write to criticize efforts to eliminate this rule are all Democrats. They also claim to have a common commitment to \u201cserving the public interest and promoting the rule of law.\u201d But everything they outline is contrary to both objectives. USDA\u2019s proposal, on the other hand, serves both.\n\nDespite the complicated name, BBCE is simple\u2014states can automatically qualify individuals who already receive cash welfare benefits into food stamps without checking their assets. The idea behind it is that states already verified eligibility when the person enrolled in another welfare program. But regulations passed during the Clinton administration, and pushed aggressively during the Obama administration, allowed state food stamp agencies to call almost anything a welfare \u201cbenefit\u201d under BBCE.\n\nHere\u2019s what that looks like in practice: states claim that brochures or hotlines are \u201cbenefits,\u201d and then categorically deem applicants eligible for food stamps without applying the federal asset test\u2014just because applicants receive these \u201cbenefits.\u201d Even worse, the loophole allows the income threshold to increase, often up to double the federal poverty level.\n\nIn their letter to USDA, the attorneys general casually gloss over the details of how these agency tactics subvert statutory guidelines. They clearly don\u2019t expect the public to learn the ins and outs of the food stamp program, let alone its loopholes. But these details matter. If the public even has any remaining trust in the welfare programs it pays for, an examination of the BBCE loophole would be the final nail in the coffin.\n\nInstead, the letter\u2019s signers use political distortion to maintain the status quo\u2014a system which maximizes welfare enrollment and minimizes program integrity.\n\nThey invoke the separation of powers, arguing that the proposed rule is an attempt \u201cto flout the legislative process\u201d because Congress has not closed the loophole itself\u2014in other words, because of Congress\u2019 inaction in correcting the regulatory failure, the executive branch should be unable to fix its own mistake. But that\u2019s not the way our government operates.\n\nBut if these attorneys general want to debate distortions of the legislative process, the BBCE loophole is a good place to start. Congress already answered the question of who should be eligible for food stamps\u2014and millionaires are not on the list. The average American agrees with them, with 77 percent of voters supporting asset tests in food stamps.\n\nKnowing that they won\u2019t win a public debate on whether millionaires or those with significant assets should receive taxpayer-funded benefits, as a last resort, the attorneys general regurgitate a tired talking point about risks to the school lunch program that BBCE poses. This transparent scare-tactic, using children who won\u2019t be impacted by the rule, has been so repeatedly debunked that it calls more for consternation than clarification. Nonetheless, we know that more than 99.9 percent of school-aged kids on food stamps nationally would still qualify for the school lunch program.\n\nNot all states exploit BBCE\u2014some, like Louisiana where I served as an assistant attorney general or my current residence of Virginia, take the novel approach of only distributing food stamp benefits to individuals eligible under federal law.\n\nThese states know\u2014much like the general public\u2014that keeping the BBCE loophole closed and following federal law preserves welfare resources for the truly needy. The Trump administration\u2019s proposal to close the loophole nationally will do the same. It turns out that following the law has its advantages. These attorneys general should understand that.\n\nScott Centorino is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Government Accountability.
