The space agency is constantly facing political whiplash when new administrations take over and impose new spaceflight goals.\n\nThe impetus for getting private companies into the human spaceflight game stems in part from the need to cut NASA's costs of launching to orbit.\n\nThe agency currently spends about $1.8 billion of its $3 billion to $4 billion space station budget on transportation.\n\nIf launch costs were reduced, that would free up money for NASA's broader exploration goals.\n\nBut, but, but: It's not yet clear exactly how much demand there will be in the private sector for human spaceflight to low-Earth orbit. A 2017 report looking at the market for a privately run space station found there isn't an obvious, profit-driven demand for such a facility in orbit, at least not yet.\n\nThe fading International Space Station\n\nFor better or worse, sometime in the next decade, the International Space Station program will likely reach the end of its life, bringing a unique and successful venue for international diplomacy to an end.\n\nWhere it stands: The ISS has been a source of international collaboration in space since the first module launched in 1998, but when the program ends, there may be no publicly funded replacement on the way.\n\nDetails: Even if the private space stations NASA is now banking on never become a reality, eventually the ISS\u2019 major components will reach the end of their technical lifespans in orbit.\n\n\"[T]he idea here is to start early so that there could be potentially a private sector space station that serves NASA's needs,\" NASA associate administrator William Gerstenmaier said during a NASA press conference at Nasdaq headquarters in New York on Friday.\n\nThe impact: When the space station ends, international collaboration in space could look very different. In fact, it could give way to growing competition instead.\n\nU.S. space rival China is planning to have its own space station in orbit by around 2022, but it's unclear exactly what kind of collaboration U.S. companies might be able to have with the nation.\n\nThe private space stations NASA's betting on might one day play host to astronauts from other countries aside from the U.S. as well, potentially democratizing human spaceflight around the world.\n\nNASA still plans to collaborate with other space programs on human spaceflight when the station ends. For example, the agency is working with Europe and Japan on its Artemis program to return astronauts to the Moon.\n\nYes but: Private sector space stations are less likely to play a large role in space diplomacy, since they'll be aiming for profit.\n\nThe ISS has acted like a peacekeeping force in the past. (In 2014, for example, Russia and the U.S. were at odds on Earth, but the two countries still needed to cooperate in space.)\n\nIt remains to be seen if a private space station will be able to fill that role as well.\n\nGo deeper: NASA looks to private companies to help commercialize low-Earth orbit", "description": "If commercial flights become the mainstream, funding and political support for NASA could dissipate.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/pTD_5eXMlI1EKdLaYsNBvcHi7OI=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/06/11/1560273528575.png", "published_at": "2019-06-11"}
