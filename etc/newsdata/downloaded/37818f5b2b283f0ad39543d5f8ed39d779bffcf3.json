The winner then collapsed some time after the race while talking to the media.\n\nBritain\u2019s sole entrant, Charlotte Purdue, was one of 16 athletes who failed to even reach the halfway point as conditions took their toll from the outset in a race of pure attrition. Runners were strung out from an early stage as they tried to do all they could to cool their bodies by wearing ice scarves and repeatedly tipping cold water over their heads.\n\nEven those who managed to complete the course were scathing of the decision to hold the race in inhospitable conditions that many observers branded dangerous.\n\nGiovanna Epis is wheeled away for medical attention Credit: REX\n\n\u201cThe humidity kills you,\u201d said Volha Mazuronak, of Belarus, who finished fifth. \u201cThere is nothing to breathe. I thought I wouldn\u2019t finish.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disrespect towards the athletes. A bunch of high-ranked officials gathered and decided that it would take [the World Championships] here but they are sitting in the cool and they are probably sleeping right now.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s Lyndsay Tessier, who finished ninth, said: \u201cYou see somebody down on the course and it\u2019s just extremely grounding and scary. That could be you in the next kilometre, the next 500m.\n\n\u201cIt was really scary and intimidating and daunting. I\u2019m just really grateful to have finished standing up.\u201d\n\nDespite the damage caused by disturbing images of runners tumbling to the tarmac with alarming regularity, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) defended their decision to hold the race in what they called \u201cvery challenging weather conditions for endurance events\u201d.\n\nA statement from the governing body said there were no cases of heat stroke and that the makeshift medical centre had \u201ccoped well and efficiently\u201d with 30 athletes treated. \u201cA small number were kept under observation and one athlete was referred to the hospital for observation but later released,\u201d they added.\n\nKenya's Ruth Chepngetich won the race but collapsed shortly after finishing the race Credit: AFP\n\nThey also said the completion rate was \u201ccomparable to previous World Championships in Tokyo 1991 and Moscow 2013\u201d.\n\nThat fact will provide scant solace for the dozens of women whose hopes of producing their best performances on the biggest stage were dashed.\n\nThe excessive heat in Qatar has created a major headache for organisers, with the event taking place long after the end of the traditional athletics season and the Khalifa International Stadium entirely air-conditioned to remain below 25C at all times during competition. That system has ensured no problems with temperature inside the stadium, where vast swathes of the stands have been covered with banners to hide huge numbers of empty seats.\n\nThe combination of the women\u2019s marathon debacle and lack of attendance inside the stadium prompted decathlon world champion and world record holder Kevin Mayer to deliver a scathing verdict of the championships on Saturday.\n\n\u201cEven if people aren\u2019t saying it out loud, it\u2019s obvious it\u2019s a disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no one in the stadium, the heat is not at all adapted, yesterday we saw about 30 people drop out of the marathon - it\u2019s sad.\n\nAthletes tried to keep cool with ice cold water Credit: Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe have to leave reason aside and concentrate on passion, because if not I would have boycotted these championships.\n\nHe added: \u201cClearly by organising the championship here, they didn\u2019t put the athletes first, they\u2019ve mostly put them in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s up to us to not act like princesses and to get on with it anyway but for sure, we\u2019re not at all in the right conditions to perform.\u201d\n\nThe IAAF insist they have done all they can to \u201cminimise heat-related risks\u201d in the long-distance road races, including increasing drinks stations, drafting in extra medical experts, setting up a makeshift medical centre and disseminating information to athletes about how to approach a race in such tough conditions.\n\nThe governing body\u2019s president Seb Coe has also repeatedly defended the decision to hold the World Championships in Qatar, by extolling the virtues of \u201cglobalising the sport\u201d and \u201ctaking it to places we have never gone before\u201d.\n\nHe has also suggested the experience here will allow them to learn lessons ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, where temperatures are expected to challenges those in Doha.", "description": "The Doha World Championships were branded a \u201cdisaster\u201d on Saturday after shocking scenes at the midnight women\u2019s marathon, where sweltering conditions caused numerous athletes to collapse and almost half the field failed to finish.
