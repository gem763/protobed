Vance Jr. said Trump\u2019s challenge doesn\u2019t belong in federal court and he\u2019s asked U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero to reject the effort to block the subpoena.\n\nMarrero will listen to lawyers as they try to persuade him during a hearing Wednesday morning. A ruling may be immediate or come within hours since Trump\u2019s attorneys are seeking emergency relief in the form of a temporary order preventing a turnover of the tax returns while the legal issues are studied in more depth.\n\nHowever Marrero rules, his decision is almost certain to be appealed.\n\nThe president\u2019s lawyers say Vance is \u201ccharging down this blatantly unconstitutional path\u201d by demanding the records from his accountant. They say Vance is subjecting Trump to a criminal probe even though he cannot be criminally charged while president.\n\nThey say Trump was cooperating with Vance\u2019s probe until the district attorney \u201ctook an outrageous step\u201d after a disagreement ensued over the scope of the subpoena.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers say Vance sent a photocopy of a congressional subpoena seeking wide access to Trump and his family\u2019s financial records to his accounting firm. In separate litigation, Trump\u2019s lawyers are challenging the congressional subpoena too.\n\n\u201cHad the District Attorney not acted in such an irresponsible and abusive fashion, the President likely would have cooperated here too,\u201d the attorneys wrote in papers submitted to Marrero Tuesday.\n\nVance argued in court papers that Trump\u2019s effort to get federal courts to intervene was misplaced since \u201cimportant separation of powers and federalism concerns prohibit federal litigation of a state court subpoena.\u201d\n\nVance and his lawyers said Trump was presenting the \u201cremarkable proposition that a sitting President enjoys not only a blanket immunity from criminal prosecution, but that this blanket immunity also protects a president from having to respond to any routine, lawful grand jury request for information about his conduct or that of his businesses or employees before he took office.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias said the White House strategy was likely aimed at delaying litigation rather than airing out thorny legal issues.\n\n\u201cThe White House has a blanket \u2018no\u2019 on everything,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, they\u2019re not going to be able to stop all of them. I think they\u2019re just trying to run out the clock, get him re-elected.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Federal prosecutors are joining President Trump in asking a New York federal judge to temporarily block a subpoena seeking his tax returns.", "authors": ["Larry Neumeister"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/trump-ny-tax-return-subpoena-federal-prosecutors.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C118px%2C3557px%2C1862px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
