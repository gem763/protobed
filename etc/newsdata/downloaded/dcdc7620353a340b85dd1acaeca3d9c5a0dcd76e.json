But the federal complaints, if found to be valid by Labor Dept. investigators, could force SAG-AFTRA to throw out the results and hold a new election.\n\nThe statement specifically singled out the latest complaint filed to the U.S. Department of Labor by Modine\u2019s campaign manager, Adam Nelson, calling it \u201cyet more poor judgment and destructive behavior,\u201d on behalf of Modine\u2019s Membership First slate.\n\nAlso Read: Matthew Modine's Campaign Manager Files Federal Complaint Over SAG-AFTRA Election\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s both astonishing and deeply distressing that Membership First continues to ignore decades of legal precedent, and remains committed to flagrantly wasting the hard-earned dues money of working class SAG-AFTRA members,\u201d read the statement.\n\n\u201cThis kind of partisan whining and clear commitment to dragging SAG-AFTRA through the mud, is exactly why Matthew Modine and his Membership First faction was roundly defeated across the country.\u201d\n\nNelson\u2019s complaint alleged that Unite For Strength violated Title IV of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, which outlines labor laws concerning union elections. Nelson, along with other Membership First supporters who have filed federal complaints, say that Carteris broke election regulations. by appearing in an episode of \u201cBH90210\u201d aired during the election period in which she plays the head of a fictional actors\u2019 union. The complaint calls the episode a \u201cblatant national commercial.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: How Hollywood's Guilds Are Bracing for Crucial Negotiations in 2020\n\nNelson\u2019s complaint also addresses a video loop screened in the guild\u2019s common areas during the election that \u201cpredominantly\u201d featured Carteris and actors that were running alongside her as part of the Unite For Strength slate while skipping actors running with Membership First. He argues that the \u201ctone, timing and content\u201d of the video proves that it served as an illegal ad for UFS candidates.\n\nBut UFS maintains that SAG-AFTRA\u2019s national election committee has upheld the election results and found Membership First\u2019s protests to be without basis. While Nelson has accused the board of choosing to \u201cturn a blind eye\u201d to the accusations, UFS maintains that the committee has remained nonpartisan, pointing out that it was unanimously approved by the guild\u2019s national board, which includes Membership First members.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the only proven violations of SAG-AFTRA election law were committed by Membership First,\u201d said UFS, bringing up claims against Membership First that were made during the election period.\n\nAlso Read: Gabrielle Carteris Wins Re-Election as SAG-AFTRA President, Beating Matthew Modine\n\n\u201cA duly appointed election committee in New Orleans found that their brazen election violations indeed warranted a rerun of the election: \u201cWe conclude that there were improper employer contributions made that benefited the NOLA Slate for Change, that these contributions violated the Election Policy and federal law, and that the violations may have affected the outcome of the election.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t so harmful, it would be comical that Membership First and Adam Nelson refuse to accept the law when their own use of illegal campaign contributions through multiple NYFA videos\u2013which received tens of thousands of impressions\u2013were indeed additional violations of federal law.\u201d\n\nThe UFS statement also levels criticisms at Modine himself, saying that he was still elected to the guild\u2019s national board despite losing the presidency but was not present at board meetings or at this month\u2019s National Convention.\n\n\u201cWe refuse to let a small group of sore losers distract us from the important work of protecting and enhancing the lives and careers of our members.\u201d\n\nRead the full statement from UFS below:\n\nIt\u2019s both astonishing and deeply distressing that Membership First continues to ignore decades of legal precedent, and remains committed to flagrantly wasting the hard-earned dues money of working class SAG-AFTRA members. This kind of partisan whining and clear commitment to dragging SAG-AFTRA through the mud, is exactly why Matthew Modine and his Membership First faction was roundly defeated across the country.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Unite for Strength, the SAG-AFTRA slate led by guild president Gabrielle Carteris, released a statement on Thursday condemning the federal complaints filed by supporters of Matthew Modine, who was defeated by Carteris in last month\u2019s election.Carteris handily won the guild election with 13,537 votes", "authors": ["Jeremy Fuster"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Bu9DCaShN0SdehPrnSTgiA--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thewrap.com/a7dc4f34594257bc4b5b2f6da32a3f26", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
