They also ransacked a shop and made off with cattle.\"\n\n\"Not a day goes by without an gun attack, and the number of displaced people arriving in Kongoussi just keeps going up,\" the resident said.\n\nZoura lies in Bam, one of a swathe of provinces in northern Burkina Faso that have been battling with a four-year-old wave of jihadist violence that came from neighbouring Mali.\n\nThe attacks - typically hit-and-run raids on villages, road mines and suicide bombings - have claimed around 600 lives nationally, according to an AFP toll.\n\nOut of 486 000 who have fled their homes, 270 000 are in the north, according to the government figures.\n\nOn Saturday, four soldiers and a police officer were killed and 11 others injured in twin attacks in the embattled north.\n\nOne took place in Bahn, in Loroum province, and the other in Yense, in Yatenga province.\n\nBurkina Faso is an impoverished and politically fragile country in the heart of the Sahel, and its security forces are badly-equipped, poorly trained and under-funded.\n\nFrance has a force of 200 in Burkina Faso but also intervenes frequently as part of its regional Barkhane operation.", "description": "Nine people were killed in northern Burkina Faso in the latest attack in a region struggling with a jihadist revolt, a security official says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9387/455de88495da49f895597e8c33f6d56a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
