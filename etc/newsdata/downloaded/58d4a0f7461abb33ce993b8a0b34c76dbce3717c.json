The had been trending higher for most of this week with a large part of its strength driven by the prospect of a Brexit deal that would reduce uncertainty and remove a major risk for not only the UK but all members of the Eurozone. A deal is close with German Chancellor Merkel saying, \u201cwe are in the last meters of the negotiation\u201d and French President Macron adding that a \u201cBrexit agreement is being finalized.\u201d An agreement should be announced in the next 24 to 48 hours and when that happens we expect all of the major currencies to rally \u2013 including the euro. The September high of 1.1109 would be the target but the rally could extend as high as 1.1150 if the market finds the deal favorable.

Spending is the back bone of the economy and the latest report gives the doves their strongest reason to back a third rate cut this year. According to the Fed\u2019s , businesses see expansion but many have cut their outlook. With that said, they report that the economy expanded at a slight-to-modest pace with tight labor market and rising wages. Fed Presidents and spoke today and the former seems more skeptical of a rate cut than the latter although Evans also feels that the economic data seems pretty good and the economy is navigating risks fairly well. Although , and other major currencies outperformed the greenback today, the losses in were limited despite weak data. Looking at the charts, USD/JPY is due for a correction, especially as we get closer to October's Fed meeting.
