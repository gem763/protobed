Gulen has denied the allegation.\n\nThe Turkish leader pressed both former President Barack Obama and Trump to eject Gulen so he can face trial in Turkey. After Obama refused to comply, Erdogan lamented in 2016 that he\u2019d grown \u201cdisillusioned\u201d with U.S. leadership.\n\nTrump \u2014 who recently pulled U.S. troops from northern Syria, opening the door for Erdogan to launch an offensive there \u2014 has reportedly sought ways to extradite Gulen from the U.S. in an effort to appease Ankara. NBC News reported last November that officials in the Trump administration had asked federal law enforcement agencies to look into legal ways to expel the cleric, an effort to assuage Turkey over the Saudi killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi on Turkish soil.\n\nTrump denied the report, however, saying that Erdogan was a \u201cfriend of mine,\u201d but ejecting Gulen was \u201cnot under consideration.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post, citing multiple former administration officials, reported Tuesday that Trump had appeared to be \u201creceptive\u201d to Giuliani\u2019s frequent suggestions that Gulen be extradited, but that other administration officials were vehemently opposed to the idea.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why Giuliani \u2014 who has also come under scrutiny in recent weeks for his role in persuading Ukraine to dig up dirt on 2020 presidential hopeful and former Vice President Joe Biden \u2015 was so fixated on the Gulen issue.\n\nFormer officials said the subject was brought up so often by the former New York mayor that aides became concerned that he was lobbying Trump on behalf of the Turkish government. At one point in 2017, officials even requested he stop raising the issue with the president, the Post reported, citing a source familiar with the exchange.\n\nWhen the Post asked Giuliani whether he\u2019d asked Trump about Gulen, he said in a text message that he \u201ccan\u2019t comment on it that would be complete attorney client privilege but sounds wacky.\u201d\n\nGiuliani, who joined the president\u2019s legal team in 2018, isn\u2019t the first Trump ally to push for Gulen\u2019s extradition. Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, lobbied on behalf of Turkey while working for the Trump campaign in 2016. That effort included writing an op-ed in The Hill on Election Day in which he lambasted Gulen as a \u201cshady,\u201d \u201cradical Islamist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe forces of radical Islam derive their ideology from radical clerics like Gulen, who is running a scam,\u201d Flynn wrote. \u201cWe should not provide him safe haven.\u201d\n\nA few months after that piece was published, Flynn, who would later also plead guilty to lying to the FBI, filed paperwork with the Justice Department acknowledging that he\u2019d received $530,000 from a Turkish company to do work that may have benefited the Turkish government in the months leading up to Election Day.\n\nFlynn also faced allegations that he\u2019d plotted to forcibly remove Gulen from the U.S. Flynn denied that he\u2019d ever considered kidnapping Gulen.", "description": "The Turkish president has demanded the U.S. extradite Fethullah Gulen, who Erdogan has accused of plotting a coup against him.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da6808f210000570fad2875.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
