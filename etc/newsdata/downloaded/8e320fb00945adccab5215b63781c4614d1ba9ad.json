AFP/Getty\n\nThe ambassador wanted to stress that Beijing wanted to avoid a belligerent relationship with the UK and promote cooperation on a number of fields. But Mr Xiaoming also complained that some politicians in Britain were taking a \u201ccolonial\u201d attitude in encouraging the current Hong Kong protests.\n\nAmbassador Xiaoming stated that China may have to intervene if the violence continued and the Hong Kong government found it could not control the unrest. Speaking to journalists of the Defence Correspondents Association in London, he said: \u201cIf the riots become uncontrollable for Hong Kong SAR government, China cannot sit on its hands and watch. Hong Kong is part of China. We can\u2019t watch this violence go on and on.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as you do not interfere in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs, I do not see there will be a problem. But some UK politicians still have a colonial mindset. They make irresponsible remarks to show support to demonstrators and rioters, and that is a problem.\u201d\n\nThe ambassador stated that the British government should not acquiesce to pressure from the Trump administration to bar the Chinese technological company, Huawei, from the UK\u2019s 5G network, or post-Brexit trade relationship may suffer.\n\n\u201cAccording to some analysis, if the UK shuts the door on Huawei [for 5G], you will lag a year and a half behind others. It will send a bad message to Chinese business. The UK is regarded as open and business-friendly. But this would damage the UK\u2019s image and harm business relations. It would look as though you are not open towards business,\u201d he maintained.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Beijing accused the UK of \u201cprovocative action\u201d and entering its territorial waters without permission.\n\nMr Xiaoming said: \u201cIt created a lot of problems in China-UK relations ... It was to show muscle; the UK should not do this dirty job for somebody else.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about Mr Williamson, Mr Xiaoming commented: \u201cSome British politician regarded China as a threat. He listed four security threats: Russia, Iran, North Korea and China. You can hardly imagine a high level official of a government who endorses China-UK \u2018golden era\u2019 to regard China as a security threat. I don\u2019t think he played a positive role.\u201d\n\nMajor General Su Guanghui, the Chinese defence attache in London, said that his country will continue take a combative stance in what it considers to be incursions into its territories: \u201cIf the US and UK join hands in a challenge or violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China, that would be hostile action.\u201d\n\nThe ambassador added: \u201cThe South China Sea is a vast ocean, it is 3 million sq km wide. We have no objection to people sailing around there but do not enter Chinese territorial waters within 12 nautical miles. If you don\u2019t do that, there shouldn\u2019t be a problem. The South China Sea is wide enough to have free navigation of shipping.\u201d\n\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK has enduring interests in the region and is committed to maintaining regional security. The presence of international navies in the South China Sea is normal and the royal navy is no exception to this.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to asserting rights of freedom of navigation at sea and in the air as provided for by international law.\u201d", "description": "China will view the sending of British and the US warships into disputed waters it claims its own as \u201chostile action\u201d with serious consequences, senior officials from the country have warned, and urged that London not get sucked into carrying out \u201cdirty jobs\u201d for Washington.", "authors": ["Kim Sengupta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/09/15/south-china-sea.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
