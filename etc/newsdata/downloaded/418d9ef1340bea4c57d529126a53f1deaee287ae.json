I thought she had fainted on the floor and I had to get her to come around. I got on the phone to the ambulance straight away.\n\n'The right side of her face was drooping. She couldn't lift her arms, move her arms or legs.'\n\nShe added: 'It was all completely out of the blue. There were no warning signs at all, she was fine before.\n\n'We are all in shock, her right arm is very weak and her memory is bad. She started walking now, but she can't walk for long she still has a wheelchair.\n\n'She did lots of dancing and gymnastics, she was healthy and there were no signs of a stroke.\n\nThe primary school student had just finished her breakfast at around 8am to go and get dressed for school before having a stroke.

Pictured in hospital after the stroke - her face is still drooping\n\n'To me a stroke is an old people thing. It isn't something that happens to a healthy ten-year-old girl.'\n\nGracie was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn. An MRI scan confirmed a blood clot on the left side of her brain had caused the stroke.\n\nKnown as an ischaemic stroke, blood supply is stopped because of the clot. The NHS says these account for 85 per cent of all strokes.\n\nMs Clark said: 'She [Gracie] then got blue lighted to Addenbrooke's Hospital, in Cambridge. She kept being sick, it was horrible. The journey felt like a life time.'\n\nThe single mother-of-four added: 'She had to have a three hour operation to remove a blood clot from the left side of her brain.\n\n'Because it was on the left side of her brain, it means her right side of her body isn't working.'\n\nThere are more than 100,000 strokes in the UK each year. It's the fourth biggest killer in England and Wales, and the third in Scotland.\n\nAccording to Ms Clark, doctors are still unsure why Gracie had a stroke so young\n\nGracie was described by her mother as 'healthy'. Pictured before the stroke\n\nTypically, strokes occur in people aged over 55. Certain conditions such as diabetes and having high blood pressure increase the risk, according to the NHS.\n\nChildhood stroke affects more than 400 children a year in the UK, according to The Stroke Association.\n\nIn the US, the risk of someone having a stroke before they turn 19 is nearly one per 20,000 children per year, according to The American Stroke Association.\n\nThe causes of stroke for children are very different from those for adults, including heart disorders, blood disorders and infections.\n\nMost commonly congenital heart disease and sickle cell disease are risk factors - but Ms Clark said her daughter showed no signs of any illness.\n\nIn about ten per cent of childhood stroke cases, the cause is unknown.\n\nDoctors have reassured Ms Clark that they expect Gracie will recover from this as she has already started to regain feeling in her fingers and legs.\n\nMs Clark said: 'The hospital are trying to encourage her to use her right arm as she is right handed and it is very weak.\n\nThe right side of Gracie's body isn't working properly following the blood clot on the brain. She is pictured with Ms Clark in hospital\n\n'She keeps getting really confused and she is getting frustrated with it all.\n\n'Because she is normally a chatterbox, it is funny because we normally joke about that she never stops speaking. She even talks in her sleep.\n\n'The whole thing is really surreal. Doctors still don't know why it happened, she had a heart scan and that has come back as normal.'\n\nGracie is currently receiving regular doses of aspirin - which is an anti-platelet drug that stops another clot from forming, the NHS says.\n\nMs Clark said: 'She started her physio yesterday throwing the ball back and forth and saying the name of whoever she is throwing the ball to as her memory is quite bad right now.\n\n'They can't give me a time on how long she will be in there for, she could be in here [hospital] for a couple of weeks.'\n\nWhen she is discharged, it is believed Gracie will need care in her own home as well as regular CT scans and check-ups.\n\nIt is also thought that Gracie will only be able to go back to school part-time because doctors currently believe her memory problems will make it difficult to keep up with schoolwork.\n\nA GoFundMe has now been set up to help Ms Clark while her daughter is in hospital as she is unable to work.\n\nMs Clark said: 'She doesn't remember anything, I don't think she understands what happened. She is only ten.\n\n'If I could do anything to help raise awareness for it I will. It has been a shock to all of us. It has just been a hideous time for me.\n\n'But she has been so lucky with this, it all could've been a lot worse.'\n\nGracie, with two of her three siblings, was rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn, Norfolk, in an ambulance. She had surgery to remove the blood clot on her brain\n\nMs Clark said Gracie can't remember much and it's not clear how long she will be in hospital", "description": "Hayley Clark, 44, of Norfolk, found her daughter, Gracie Wittick, collapsed in her bedroom.
