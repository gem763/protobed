It was a blow to Boies, who\u2019s sparred with Dershowitz for decades, and Sigrid McCawley, a partner at the firm who represents multiple victims of Epstein.\n\nIn a statement, McCawley said her firm would appeal Preska\u2019s decision to remove them from Giuffre\u2019s litigation in Manhattan federal court.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision rejects Alan Dershowitz\u2019s chronic capacity to make this case about anything but the facts and what he has been accused of by our client, Virginia Giuffre. The defamation case against Alan Dershowitz is going forward and he will have to face justice,\u201d McCawley, a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe decision, however, to disqualify our firm, which has had the privilege of representing Virginia and advocating for her brave voice and continued call for justice, is deeply disappointing and it will be promptly appealed.\u201d\n\nThe order comes almost a month after Giuffre\u2019s and Dershowitz\u2019s legal teams faced off during oral arguments, after which Dershowitz held a press conference and accused Giuffre and her advocates of doing \u201ca terrible disservice\u201d to the #MeToo movement.\n\nBoies and his firm have represented Giuffre for years, including in a separate defamation suit filed against Epstein\u2019s alleged madame, Ghislaine Maxwell. (A cache of court records in that case were unsealed last summer, providing a deeper look into the sexual abuse allegations against Epstein and his powerful friends.)\n\nDershowitz, 81, argued the 78-year-old Boies should be booted from his case based on a conflict of interest: He was briefly a client of Boies\u2019 firm and says he provided an attorney with confidential information related to his fight against Giuffre\u2019s accusations. The professor also argued Boies and his firm\u2019s attorneys would be called as witnesses in Giuffre\u2019s case.\n\nThe latter argument was more significant, according to Preska\u2019s order, which noted, \u201cBecause disqualification is so clearly required under the advocate-witness rule, the Court does not reach the conflict of interest argument advanced by Dershowitz.\u201d\n\nAccording to the rule, an attorney cannot represent a party where the attorney will be called as a witness. \u201cThe rule differentiates between an attorney who will be called on behalf of his client and an attorney who will be called as a witness other than on behalf of his client,\u201d Preska wrote in her order.\n\n\u201cA lawyer may also not act as an advocate where \u2018another lawyer in the lawyer\u2019s firm is likely to be called as a witness on a significant issue other than on behalf of the client, and it is apparent that the testimony may be prejudicial to the client,\u2019\u201d Preska added.\n\n\u201c Dershowitz went looking for trouble, and by his repeated affirmative republications, he found it. \u201d \u2014 Judge Preska\n\nIn her complaint, Giuffre said Dershowitz\u2019s statements that she conspired with her lawyers to extort him, and Epstein\u2019s associate and client Les Wexner, are false. She also referenced a secretly-recorded phone call between Dershowitz and Boies; Dershowitz says Boies declared on the call that Giuffre was \u201csimply wrong\u201d in her accusation, while Giuffre has said Boies\u2019 assertions were taken \u201cout of context.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy so pleading, Giuffre made the truth of these statements \u2026 a necessary\u2014indeed essential\u2014part of the Complaint,\u201d Preska ruled.\n\n\u201cDershowitz\u2019s allegation of an extortion conspiracy is no mere throwaway line,\u201d the judge added of Giuffre\u2019s complaint, which was filed in April. \u201cGiuffre explicitly characterizes Dershowitz\u2019s \u2018central assertion\u2019 as the facts that Giuffre committed perjury and that she and her attorneys \u2018hatched a scheme to falsely accuse Dershowitz of sex trafficking as part of a criminal attempt to extort a settlement from another party.\u2019\u201d\n\nGiuffre must prove at trial that Boies Schiller Flexner (BSF) lawyers didn\u2019t participate in the extortion scheme Dershowitz has alleged.\n\n\u201cEither way, BSF is immersed in the facts it pled,\u201d Preska stated.\n\n\u201cAgain it is essential to follow the litigation jujitsu at work here,\u201d the judge continued. \u201cGiuffre says Dershowitz defamed her by falsely saying she and BSF engaged in an extortion scheme; Dershowitz says he said it and it is true. Giuffre\u2019s burden is to prove it is false in the face of Dershowitz\u2019s vehement claim that it is true.\u201d\n\nAccording to Preska\u2019s order, new counsel for Giuffre and Dershowitz\u2019s legal team must submit a proposed discovery plan by Nov. 13.\n\nMeanwhile, Dershowitz argued Giuffre\u2019s complaint should be dismissed because the statements he made in 2018 and 2019\u2014calling her a \u201ctotal liar\u201d who fabricated allegations against him for money\u2014are \u201csubstantially identical\u201d to statements he made in 2015 and therefore barred under the statute of limitations.\n\nYet, Preska\u2019s order states that Dershowitz \u201cadmits he took affirmative steps to republish his prior statements to defend himself and his reputation by influencing new audiences or re-influencing old audiences.\u201d\n\n\u201cSaid differently, Dershowitz went looking for trouble, and by his repeated affirmative republications, he found it.\u201d", "description": "A judge denied the Harvard lawyer's attempt to dismiss a case brought by an Epstein victim against him, but ruled that his nemesis David Boies could no longer represent the woman.", "authors": ["Kate Briquelet", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1821,w_3239,x_0,y_323/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571250534/191015-briquelet-dershowitz_nbd1bv", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
