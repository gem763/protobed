We will not be licensing this event, it will not be under our jurisdiction. That has not stopped Nigel being a guest at our annual awards dinner on Friday night, as he is a treasured member of the boxing community.\u201d\n\nThe event, promoted by Mark Peters, will be sanctioned under the jurisdiction of another boxing board, in the way that David Haye and Dereck Chisora fought at the Boleyn Ground in 2012, under the auspices of the Luxembourg Boxing Federation.", "description": "The British Boxing Board of Control has refused to grant Nigel Benn a licence to return to the sport at the age of 55, 23 years after his last professional fight.", "authors": ["Gareth A Davies", "Boxing Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/boxing/2019/09/23/TELEMMGLPICT000004413416-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqAn42fo-ub25UKGJAQWgg2YdFC9JS-BOfYe-cXXOYjbc.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
