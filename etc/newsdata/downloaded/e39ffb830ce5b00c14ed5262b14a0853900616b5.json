We are 100% confident that two of them are alive as the officials saw them going out for food around the area of Haew Narok falls,\" Nattapong said.\n\nThailand has only about 3,500 to 3,700 wild elephants left nationwide, according to the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation.\n\nThe 2,000 square km (772 square mile) Kao Yai National Park is believed to have around 300 wild elephants as well as other wildlife. Now that two major accidents have occurred there, Nattapong said conservation officials are talking about building walkways over the falls or other solutions.\n\n\"We will try to find a way to prevent this kind of tragedy from happening again,\" he said.
