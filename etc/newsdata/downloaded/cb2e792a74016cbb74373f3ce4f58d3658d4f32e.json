Mr. Dowd accused the committee, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, California Democrat, of harassing his clients.\n\nMr. Parnas and Fruman are Russian-born Republican Party donors who helped Mr. Giuliani make contacts with a number of Ukraine officials.\n\nHouse Democrats are investigating Mr. Giuliani\u2019s moves as part of their impeachment inquiry.\n\nAs Mr. Trump\u2019s attorney during the Mueller probe, Mr. Giuliani began investigating a counter-narrative \u2014 that the government in Kyiv colluded with Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign to provide dirt on candidate Trump.\n\nThat probe led Mr. Giuliani to begin leveling charges against former vice president Joe Biden, a possible Trump opponent. Mr. Giuliani accused Mr. Biden of corruption in his son, Hunter, landing of a lucrative board seat on a Ukraine national gas firm owned by a corrupt oligarch.\n\nAnd, it came up in Mr. Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. A White House transcript of that call triggered the impeachment inquiry.\n\nMr. Dowd told committee investigative counsel Nicolas A. Mitchell that his fast-track probe leaves no time to adequately prepare a defense by a Monday deadline.\n\n\u201cYour request for documents and communications is overly broad and unduly burdensome,\u201d Mr. Down wrote in a letter obtained by The Washington Times. \u201cThe subject matter of your requests is well beyond the scope of your inquiry. This, in combination with requiring immediate responses, leads me to the inescapable conclusion that the Democratic Committee members\u2019 intent is to harass, intimidate and embarrass my clients.\u201d\n\nMr. Dowd said that in addition to working with Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Parnas and Fruman have aided prominent husband-wife legal team Joseph DiGenova and Victoria Toensing \u201cin their law practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThus, certain information you seek in your September 30, 2019, letter is protected by the attorney-client , attorney work product and other privileges,\u201d Mr. Dowd said. \u201cGiven the breadth and detail of your request for information, an appropriate privilege review cannot reasonably be conducted by October 7, 2019, the date you have set to produce documents and communications.\u201d\n\nA letter from three House committees to Mr. Parnas and Fruman said:\n\n\u201cThe Committees are investigating the extent to which President Trump jeopardized national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with our 2020 election and by withholding security assistance provided by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression , as well as any efforts to cover up these matters.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
