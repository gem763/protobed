That has reinforced views the government must roll out more stimulative measures to spur investment and stabilize economic activity.\n\n\"August lending data is in line with market expectations. It shows increased support for the real economy. In the next step, monetary policy is expected to be preemptive and flexible, there is room for cutting interest rates and reserve requirements,\" said Wen Bin, economist at Minsheng Bank in Beijing.\n\nAugust new loans were up from July and slightly more than analysts had expected, People's Bank of China (PBOC) data showed on Wednesday.\n\nAnalysts polled by Reuters had predicted new yuan loans would rise to 1.2 trillion yuan in August, up from 1.06 trillion yuan the previous month and compared with 1.28 trillion yuan a year earlier.\n\nHousehold loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 653.8 billion yuan in August from 511.2 billion yuan in July, while corporate loans climbed to 651.3 billion yuan from 297.4 billion yuan.\n\nBroad M2 money supply in August grew 8.2% from a year earlier, above estimates of 8.1% forecast in the Reuters poll. It rose 8.1% in July.\n\nOutstanding yuan loans grew 12.4% from a year earlier \u2014 in line with expectations but slower than July's 12.6%. Some analysts say the annual comparison is a better way to assess trends in China's credit growth, rather than more volatile monthly readings.", "description": "Chinese regulators have been trying to boost bank lending and lower financing costs for more than a year.
