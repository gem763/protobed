Specifically, not great ones. The director himself called it a \u201cbreakup movie.\u201d The film\u2019s heroine experiences a series of traumatic incidents, including losing her entire family and various death-cult activities, but most traumatic of all: She has a trash boyfriend.\n\nNow, in the spirit of the film\u2019s plot (or in tacit acknowledgment of those who took their partners to see Midsommar and were told that it was dumb and artsy and worse than Suspiria and to stop, for God\u2019s sake, taking them to these things), A24, the studio behind the movie, is partnering with digital therapy company Talkspace. So, if death cults or bad taste are straining your relationship, all you have to do is comment on A24\u2019s ad to get three free months of couples therapy:", "description": "A24, the studio behind Ari Aster\u2019s Midsommar, has partnered with Talkspace to offer free couples therapy.", "authors": ["Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/26/26-midsommar-couples-therapy.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
