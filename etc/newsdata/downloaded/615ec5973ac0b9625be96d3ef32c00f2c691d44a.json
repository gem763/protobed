Heck, some of them might not have to be addressed this week or even this month. One way to keep from stretching yourself too thin is not to schedule any appointments or meetings on the day you get back. Also, make sure that you take frequent breaks so you don't burn yourself out. One thing I've noticed is that I've tended to skip lunch that first day back because I'm so stressed and busy. Don't do this. You need the energy a nutritious meal provides. Plus, attending lunch will allow you to engage with your team and find out what happened while you were away, as well as share stories from your vacation.\n\nOne company I worked for had a fun policy. Whoever came back from vacation had to have photos in rotation on their computer. At the return lunch, we took a full 30 minutes to view them and hear about their trip. Maybe it was overkill, but no one in the office would have missed work on the day of a return from holiday. I planned and executed better vacations, prepared betterfor the vacation, and everyone enjoyed returning to the office more because of these get-togethers.", "description": "Returning from vacation is the worst part of vacation.
