Gevinson and photographer Eva O\u2019Leary reenacted some of its phases. Act I, The Polaroid: Before #nofilter, the filter was the point. Photo: Eva O\u2019Leary. Special thanks to Royal Palms Shuffleboard.\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nMy senior year of high school, I had three Instagram accounts: a public one, a private one for friends and internet friends, and a private one that was just for me. By this point, I\u2019d had an online audience for six years or so: first for the fashion blog I started when I was 11, and then for Rookie, the online magazine for teenage girls I\u2019d started when I was 15 as an alternative to the getting-a-boyfriend-centric mainstream teen magazines that still existed in 2011.\n\nPosts on my public account were mostly dispatches from my in-person life, which still consisted primarily of going to school every day in Oak Park, Illinois, and editing Rookie when I got home. The private account for friends was more of a place to voice frustrations and petty thoughts. And the private account that was just for me was like if my public one was more shameless: thirstier selfies, pictures with famous people at their homes and dinner parties, souvenirs from the world of wealth and prestige that I\u2019d occasionally been granted access to through my internet fame. These photos felt too obviously desperate and social climb\u2013y for my other accounts, but I wanted to know how it would feel to enhance them with filters, to watch the little blue bar advance as they uploaded, to see these moments framed \u2014 or blessed, really \u2014 by Instagram\u2019s interface.\n\nI can\u2019t remember exactly how the account came about. I used it for only a week or two and then, regrettably, deleted it \u2014 most likely out of shame or a fear of its being somehow discovered. But it feels accurate to say that it was the only thing I made growing up that truly was just for me. Unlike with my diaries, there was no lurking notion of posterity. I would have been horrified if anyone had seen it, rather than like, \u201cOMG, that\u2019s so embarrassing; but what about the prose?\u201d It existed just to scratch an itch, to satisfy the part of myself that had learned to register experience as only fully realized once primed for public consumption, but that was monitored by the other part of myself, the part that knew the actual sharing of these specific moments would appear inauthentic: I\u2019d look too fancy for Rookie and too trying-to-be-fancy to be a real celebrity. So I engaged in this private fantasy of my own public life, just differently packaged \u2014 openly shrewd and braggadocian rather than \u201crelatable.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that my public account was some highly curated performance. I\u2019ve always thought I could be myself in public pretty easily \u2014 by which I mean, speak without second-guessing myself too much on social media, in writing, in interviews. But the memory of my private account tells me I still had a strong instinct for savvy that I couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t admit to myself or anyone. I never considered myself calculating \u2014 who does? \u2014 and when I did catch glimpses of my own ambition, I thought it was ugly, disgraceful, incongruous with my authentic self, who simply wanted to make things and connect with people and probably, one day, move to the woods.\n\nAnd yet the rapid-fire stage-mom math I performed in curating my various Instagram accounts was likely instrumental to the presentation of my authentic self that would eventually lead to branded-content deals, acting roles, and my career as I now know it. Rather than some tamped-down impulse, my ability to control how I was seen, to know what to say (and when, and how), was maybe never switched off but an instinct like any other, dovetailing with the many conscious and unconscious decisions that made up all my acts of self-expression. After all, I had been honing my shareability lens for many years before Instagram and already received much praise for \u201cbeing myself.\u201d Somewhere along the line, I think I came to see my shareable self as the authentic one and buried any tendencies that might threaten her likability so deep down I forgot they even existed.\n\nWhere would I be without Instagram? Definitely not in the luxury rental building I was paid to live in and post about for a year back in 2017. Nor in the apartment I moved to when the year was up, as the pay stubs provided to my new landlord were mostly from appearing in ad campaigns that had required posting on Instagram. Without Instagram, it\u2019s possible I wouldn\u2019t have gotten the acting job that moved me to New York, nor the relationships, experiences, and identity that followed. I definitely would have less income and less of an audience to share this essay with.\n\nWho would I be without Instagram? The fact that it\u2019s impossible to parse its exact influence on me indicates that it runs deep. I can try to imagine an alternate universe where I\u2019ve always roamed free and Instagram-less in pastures untouched by the algorithm. But I can\u2019t imagine who that person is inside. I can\u2019t tell you exactly what Instagram has done to me, but I can tell you how it has felt to grow up with it.\n\nI got Instagram in 2011, when I was 15, at the same time I got an iPhone. Early on, it felt like a fun, paced-up version of blogging, meant for savoring parts of my real life and peeking into the realities of people unlike me. The more I used it, however, the more I found myself searching for some definitive reality in the way I was perceived by others via comments, likes, and follows. Before Instagram, my faraway audience could be conjured only when I sat at my computer, and it disappeared when I went to school.\n\nWith Instagram, self-defining and self-worth-measuring spilled over into the rest of the day, eventually becoming my default mode. If I received conflicting views of my worth or, looking at other people\u2019s accounts, disparate ideas about how to live, the influx of information could lead to a kind of panic spiral. I would keep scrolling as though the cure for how I felt was at the bottom of my feed. I\u2019d feel like I was crawling out of my skin, heartbeat first, for minutes and hours. Finally, I\u2019d see something that made me feel bad enough to put my phone away.\n\nI think I am a writer and an actor and an artist. But I haven\u2019t believed the purity of my own intentions ever since I became my own salesperson, too.\n\nFor all my years growing up online, I am still unable to both rapidly and accurately manage so many realities at once: to account for hundreds of people\u2019s feedback in a matter of minutes; to know what to give weight to and what to let go of, what to take at face value and what to read into, what strikes a chord because of a real insecurity I have and what strikes a chord because of a silly insecurity I\u2019ve learned to have, what of other people is authentic or performance or both or neither, and how to catch my brain when it goes to this place. This cycle of judging and being judged is a black hole in which time disappears, in which I and the people I encounter are all frozen in our profiles. It is where I nourish my insecurities over the millions of past versions of me that float around like old yearbook photos and where I still judge people I don\u2019t know for reasons I can\u2019t even remember. Together, we have helped Instagram become its own multibillion-dollar economy: the influencer industry, where people become brands and where brands reach people through other people, fueled by our attempts to solve the great mystery of how one looks in the eyes of another.\n\nThere are plenty of well-documented reasons to distrust Instagram \u2014 the platform where one is never not branding, never not making Facebook money, never not giving Facebook one\u2019s data \u2014 but most unnerving are the ways in which it has led me to distrust myself. After countless adventures through the black hole, my propensity to share, perform, and entertain has melded with a desire far more cynical: to be liked, quantifiably, for an idealized version of myself, at a rate not possible even ten years ago.\n\nI think I am a writer and an actor and an artist. But I haven\u2019t believed the purity of my own intentions ever since I became my own salesperson, too.\n\nBy the time I had Instagram, I was already used to watching myself multiply. I started my fashion blog in 2008. My friend\u2019s older sister had one and sent me others to read. I wanted to participate. Nearly every day after school, I came home, grabbed my dad\u2019s tripod and family\u2019s digital camera, and took a photo of my outfit, usually in our backyard. Finding the act of posing somewhat embarrassing, I mostly tried to make my face as neutral as possible, or goofy and self-effacing, or occasionally \u2014 if it were a film-still-esque shot \u2014 emote. Then, using the app PhotoFiltre and the now-defunct website Picnik, I edited the photos, altering the light, the coloring, the implied era. I pasted my face onto scans of old photo-booth strips, passports, and Polaroids. I could repeat it like a Warhol or frame it like CinemaScope. Sometimes my photos were supposed to be of characters, but they were always a way of envisioning myself in times and places that felt more real and more special than our backyard: movies, fashion editorials, a vague idea of the distant past.\n\nI\u2019d had various online avatars since I was little \u2014 the cartoon creatures of Neopets and Webkinz, the dolls and celebrities on dress-up-game websites like Barbie and Stardoll, the projections of future me on Sims 2. But with a camera and a blog, I could be my own avatar. I could be myself.\n\nI got to know my own face intimately. I noticed my body changing in these photos before I did in the mirror. (Looking in the mirror was always about my outfit; my body was just a way to wear clothes.) As my blog gained readers and received press, my face began staring back at me from other websites, from magazine covers, from the monitors at talk-show studios, and then from TV. After a childhood of community theater, I used the talent agency that approached me about my writing to start auditioning for movies, and then I saw myself on bigger screens, too. Sometimes it scared me, so I tried to differentiate between the fear of being seen for who I am and the dissociating feeling of being looked at for who I\u2019m not. Mostly, though, I was game: The landscapes I once Photoshopped my way into were materializing around me.\n\nOnce my blog started getting readers and press, it was also met with skepticism, with a writer for the Cut even speculating that it was a hoax. Ten years ago, just the idea of a child sharing parts of her life online to an anonymous audience was a novelty. Famous young people were usually musicians, actors, models, athletes \u2014 people with corporations and contracts behind them. Few fashion bloggers were monetizing their hobby back then, and there wasn\u2019t much of a road map for doing so. There were YouTubers with niche followings but no full-time influencers as we think of them today. Ryan, the 8-year-old unboxing star who now makes millions of dollars on YouTube, was not yet born.\n\nWhen bloggers like myself first got invited to Fashion Week, some editors and critics voiced their disapproval, citing our lack of credentials or, in my case, the idea that it was unhealthy for a 14-year-old to attend (as long as she was writing and not, say, modeling for free, like other girls there my age). I felt like my blog\u2019s popularity was more symbolically powerful than actually threatening. I also saw the two forms of media as serving different purposes: Magazines were the authorities on fashion and fashion news; I was just writing about what I liked, just being myself.\n\nNow, that power balance has shifted: Influencers (or people ostensibly just being themselves) and brands with faces have larger digital followings than legacy titles on the social platforms where most online engagement happens. I used to feel I saw a clear line between those whose careers would not have existed without the internet (YouTubers, bloggers like me) and those who had already been approved by the pre-internet legacy-media Establishment (most celebrities). Today, even those who already had the approval of that Establishment are increasingly pivoting to influencing: Reese Witherspoon, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jessica Alba. Whether calculated or not, shirking Instagram in exchange for privacy and mystique is now a status symbol reserved for only a handful of stars.\n\nAfter starting high school, I became disillusioned with the fashion industry, writing on my blog about the day in 2011 when I sat next to Anna Wintour in the front row of a Band of Outsiders show: \u201cI felt like I was watching everything going on around me through a window. Usually I could see out of it, but every once in a while I was forced to look at my own reflection, which was less fun.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to work in fashion; I wanted to go to high school and write about high school. I wanted a feminist teen magazine to read, written by actual teens and other bloggers I liked, and I wanted to start it and edit it myself. So, also in 2011, I announced to my readers that I was starting Rookie. Jane Pratt gave it her blessing. Ira Glass advised my dad and me on how to monetize it. New York Media became our ad representative.\n\nMy readers became Rookie\u2019s readers, contributors, and editors. For seven years, I dictated our monthly editorial themes, reviewed pitches, scoured the internet for new contributors, DM\u2019d celebrities to ask them to do something with us, and wrote a monthly \u201cEditor\u2019s Letter.\u201d I edited and art-directed our five print anthologies and promoted them through press and tours and, of course, on Instagram.\n\nEverything or thing I encountered in person I had already interacted with or consumed online.\n\nAt first, I shared mostly \u201cvintage-looking\u201d iPhone photos \u2014 details of outfits and corners of my room disguised by Instagram\u2019s old-timey filters. I also posted about Rookie\u2019s books and events but rarely our content. I didn\u2019t want people to see Rookie as my lifestyle brand or feel like they needed to like me in order to get something out of Rookie. Another rule to protect my soul, carried over from my blogging days, was to ignore the numbers \u2014 my follower count, Rookie\u2019s traffic. Being considered a polarizing figure as a tween had taught me that fame was largely arbitrary and impersonal but could be leveraged to get opportunities and to find an audience for my work.\n\nI wanted to reap fame\u2019s benefits without feeling like my life would become a video game of winning people over and seeking attention. I wanted Rookie to reap the benefits of my fame without being inhibited by it and without inhibiting me by feeling like the whole of my identity. My blog had found its readers organically \u2014 that is, without the aid of marketing, advertising, a publicist, a manager, what have you \u2014 and I thought making Rookie really good was enough for it to do the same. It was, for a while.\n\nAfter high school, I moved to New York, and the black hole came to life. Everyone and everything I encountered in person I had already interacted with or consumed online. The people I was fans of became real people I knew, but they didn\u2019t know what I knew about them, and I didn\u2019t know what they knew about me. There were a million versions of all of us running around in one another\u2019s heads.\n\nI acted in three Broadway plays. I gossiped, bought lots of clothes, drank too much. On Instagram, I posted my own press photos, party photos, and red-carpet photos, and I quieted the inner, younger me who would\u2019ve found that shallow and gross. There was no need for another private fake-public account for these moments; they became my everyday. At last, I could claim the realm of visibility I\u2019d authentically infiltrated.\n\nAct II, The Influencer: When all the #con became #spon. Photo: Eva O\u2019Leary\n\nWhen I review posts from this era now, I almost envy my own life as though it were someone else\u2019s. Then I mentally fill it out with everything that happened off camera. Here\u2019s my friend and me dancing at a fashion party in very tiny outfits; today, we no longer speak. Here\u2019s me in the pool at my Palm Springs Airbnb; I self-medicated so much I missed my flight home. Here\u2019s me posing at the Met Ball; I sent my therapist an email declaring my spiritual crisis from inside the after-party bathroom. Outside the bathroom, at the Standard Hotel, was a literal hall of mirrors.\n\nThe biggest discrepancy between Instagram reality and reality-reality, however, was my and Rookie\u2019s visibility versus our financial state. For years, Rookie could run on income from ads and book deals alone, and I could see myself as more of an editor than someone who had to pay attention to numbers. Around 2015, this was no longer sustainable: The digital-ad model imploded, and more and more online engagement moved to social media.\n\nInstagram was both a threat to Rookie\u2019s existence and offered as the solution to its problems. Although we still had a steady readership who came straight to the site every day, Rookie\u2019s Instagram became both crucial to directing existing readers to the site and a destination in its place. The number of comments on Rookie went way down. Rookie\u2019s traffic steadily declined. Our Instagram posts teasing new content on the site started getting more comments than the site itself. Our Instagram presence still benefited Rookie but not as much as engagement on Rookie\u2019s site would have.\n\nThe internet was changing, and I became an adult. I knew it would stunt my growth to be Rookie\u2019s editor indefinitely, to try to read teenagers\u2019 minds long after I had been one. Still, I never thought that should mean the end of Rookie for future generations. So in 2017, Rookie\u2019s publisher and I started seeking options to give it a long life: funding, partnerships, acquisitions. In these conversations with media companies and potential investors, we were continually told that Rookie had a much better chance of survival and even financial success if I committed more fully to being its face in the style of Gwyneth or Girlboss or Oprah, which partly meant using Instagram a lot more.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t help make Rookie and me feel separate, but the goal was to get it to a more sustainable place and then find my successor, the face of its next era. Building my personal brand on Instagram also meant I could support myself more through sponsored content, which meant I could continue not taking a salary from Rookie, as I had since its inception. (As a teen, I hadn\u2019t needed to support myself; as an adult with income from acting and ad campaigns, I decided Rookie\u2019s resources would be put to better use by hiring other editors. Among founders of start-ups, this is somewhat common: forfeiting a salary in order to grow a company and eventually see a larger financial reward.)\n\nThat year, Instagram became another job: I used it to promote Rookie more and to do more \u201csponcon.\u201d The requests came in through my agents and managers. I did fashion campaigns and live events where social-media posts were worked into the contracts. I said yes to most of them, drawing the line at a store event that would involve posing with various lotions and a tacked-on message about self-love. Sometimes, brands our publisher had secured for Rookie partnerships wanted a post on my Instagram as part of the deal, too.\n\nThis is where the luxury rental building comes in. I was asked to live at 300 Ashland, right by the Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn, as part of a campaign the real-estate company Two Trees was doing to promote three new developments. In a deal that covered my rent for a year, I agreed to do press about the building, host an event for my followers on its plaza, and post about the building and neighborhood on my account. I\u2019d long shared my living space online and decided to see this as no different, except I would get paid. And so, for a year, I lent my face to promote a borrowed home.\n\nI was paid a flat rate for the whole year, not by the post, and the question of how often to post was left pretty open. Mostly, the marketing firm deferred to me, as they too wanted my Instagram to feel like I was posting the same content I would normally. Before the campaign was announced, the firm asked me to post a photo showing I had moved, geotagging the building but not tagging it as an #ad. I complied, figuring I\u2019d have shared that I\u2019d moved anyway. Of course, that didn\u2019t make it not an ad, so I was called out in the comments for not being transparent. From then on, the firm asked that I use the hashtag #300AshlandPartner.\n\nShortly thereafter \u2014 June 2017 \u2014 Instagram introduced the partnership tag feature, so that influencers could clearly identify paid posts and there\u2019d be no more confusion. Today, along with partnership tags, there\u2019s a Checkout feature, available only to select influencers, that allows their followers to purchase products directly through sponsored posts. Sponcon has also become more common among people who are not considered influencers first: art curators, magazine editors, actors, illustrators. But in those early days, at least among some of my followers, the idea of advertising that posed as organic only read as creepy. I don\u2019t know if they now see deals like mine more as a necessary evil or (as I did) an easy way to subsidize lower-paying projects, or if they\u2019ve just accepted that Instagram has become one big shopping mall.\n\nSome of the criticism I received included speculation around my financial situation. With multiple high profile jobs, how much more did I really need? I learned that influence, visibility, and cultural currency imply a wealth that the imagination can really run with. But as plenty of actors, models, and content creators can attest, visibility and money do not have a direct correlation. The internet is full of people making free content in the hope of eventually being known enough to get sponsored or hired. Actors receive press and accolades for movies for which they were paid scale. Until recently, models regularly walked shows for luxury fashion brands for trade.\n\nConversely, some types of visibility can pay disproportionately well: I once made more money doing a daylong photo shoot for a fashion campaign than I did performing in eight shows a week in five different nonprofit theater productions combined. Rookie helped me make a personal brand I could leverage for money, but I never profited from it financially \u2014 the two times I did pay myself for my work at Rookie, that money went back into it soon after.\n\nNone of this negates the criticisms I received for my initial lack of transparency or for the building\u2019s contribution to gentrification. It only serves to highlight the way the black hole can make something as personal as one\u2019s finances seem knowable to strangers.\n\nAct III, The Professional: Celebrities invaded Instagram and social-media manager became a job. Photo: Eva O\u2019Leary. Dress by Prada. Shoes by Manolo Blahnik. Clutch by Bienen Davis.\n\nI saw Rookie not as a financially successful business but as a publication good enough to organically gain millions of readers. Still, I felt like a fraud for being more valuable as a personal brand making money on Instagram than as a founder whose business couldn\u2019t afford to give her a salary and who couldn\u2019t get certain investors or buyers onboard or chickened out from pursuing those who\u2019d expressed interest. In an ad campaign or on Instagram, my face tells a story of self-made, multi-hyphenate success; it represents Rookie\u2019s influence and the web\u2019s democratization of fashion and publishing. Those were all real. But they felt less real if I considered that I could only actually support myself using the face part.\n\nIn the mirror, my face tells me the story of my own anxiety. In 2014, the same year I moved to New York, with my face on the cover of this very magazine, I developed a habit of picking at its skin. I sometimes do it mindlessly in the middle of another activity and almost always if I find myself in front of a mirror. Once I start, I continue until I feel some release via peel, pop, et cetera. (Sorry.) Once I realize what I have done, I examine my reflection and feel like a stupid feral animal. I hate that my anxiety is so easily betrayed by my face, that whether I go bare or wear cakey makeup, I am wearing my psychology for all to see. The self-loathing leads to more picking, and the cycle continues.\n\nOf all the nervous habits to have, why claw at my greatest asset? One friend suggests it is a territorial response to publicness, a way of exercising control. Another thinks it is a subconscious rejection of the type of fame I have both relied on and resented. I wonder if \u2014 much like my old refusal to see Rookie as a business \u2014 the longer I continue to pick at my face, the longer I feel less like a participant in the adult world and more like a teenager who is still just visiting. I imagine that the day my skin clears will be the day I become a woman, greeted by new forms of sexism and ageism. With scabs and pimples, I am not taking any of this too seriously; I am dodging certain expectations before I can fail to meet them. I am still an advanced child, rather than an average adult.\n\nWhatever the source of this anxiety, it seemed foolish to do things I knew were making it worse. So in the fall of 2017, I evaluated which activities could go. Rookie, at that time, felt nonnegotiable. So did promoting it on Instagram. And promoting my sponsored apartment and my acting projects and my general self I make money off, also on Instagram. But the actual act of posting \u2014 and of mindlessly scrolling through the black hole, looking for a self-destructive hit, much in the style of skin-picking \u2014 that could go. I asked a woman who had done personal-assistant work for me if she wanted a new gig. Since then, I\u2019ve texted her my photos and captions, and she has posted them on my behalf.\n\nSome friends are disturbed to hear of my secret Instagram system, though none suspect it until I tell them. They are offended that I don\u2019t see their posts and comments or are weirded out to imagine my going to the trouble of sending someone something designed to look in-the-moment or impulsive.\n\nI\u2019m not sure my Instagram posts were ever very \u201cin the moment\u201d; I\u2019ve always labored over them. As far as other people\u2019s posts go, I still look at some accounts on my computer as though they were blogs. Sometimes I check comments there, too, where it\u2019s less tempting to get sucked in, and this year, I started a Google doc where this person pastes any feedback I might be interested in, according to the criteria I\u2019ve specified: the kind of personal, detailed comments I used to see on Rookie or my blog; constructive criticism; and anything from a verified account \u2014 Instagram is a networking tool, after all. I am ashamed to admit how many nice comments I don\u2019t see, but internalizing praise can be just as unhealthy as internalizing contempt.\n\nIn November 2018, for a host of financial and personal reasons you probably saw coming, Rookie folded. I published a long letter to our readers about why and spent a day reading the loving reactions on Twitter and Instagram before understanding that I still felt too raw. I opted for some quiet.\n\nSince Rookie ended, lots of people have referred to it as one of the safest, kindest places on the internet. And it was genuinely very special, thanks to the thoughtfulness and talents of everyone in its community. Still, I suspect that part of why it has taken on a mythic quality as one of very few exceptions to the internet\u2019s general hostility is that social-media platforms are designed to feel hostile, and if that\u2019s where you spend most of your time, you probably think social media is the whole of the internet.\n\nAs Jia Tolentino writes in her essay \u201cThe I in the Internet,\u201d social-media platforms work best \u2014 that is, as they are intended to \u2014 when they are unsatisfying. For all the knowledge and inspiration that many social-media users have given me via their profiles, the apps themselves (I mean Instagram and Twitter) were designed to be hierarchical and addictive. Despite these platforms\u2019 recent attempts to be less detrimental to their users\u2019 mental health, to monitor and improve \u201cconversation health,\u201d and to retroactively apply journalistic ethics to cesspools of abuse and misinformation, their business models are based on exploiting people\u2019s psychology for maximum engagement, much like a video game you can\u2019t stop playing but will never win.\n\nSince enacting my system, I think about 20 people in a day instead of 500,000. I am largely absent from a wider social circle, but I am a more attentive close friend. I am rarely moved to capture moments for public consumption since eliminating the step of priming them in Instagram\u2019s gloss. I am less frightened by the mundanities that fall outside the black hole and have come to see that they are actually luxuries: waiting, in-betweens, the minutiae that make up my daily routine.\n\nMy system created a buffer that allowed me to piece together a private life and probably the clarity necessary to finally shut down Rookie. I don\u2019t know what would be on a private fake-public account now, as I pretty much share everything I want to and don\u2019t share everything I don\u2019t want to. I still have my anxious skin habit, but I respect myself a little more, knowing that I\u2019ve made decisions toward a less stressful life.\n\nAfter Rookie folded, I watched my follower count drop from 544,000 to 509,000. I saw in my analytics that I have more followers in the 45-to-54-year-old bracket than the 13-to-17-year-old one. When I first noticed these shifts, they felt significant, and I was struck with the feeling that I still \u201cneed\u201d to use my account for work. But my job now is to finish writing a book and a movie. Any sense of obligation I feel toward sharing myself on Instagram is more out of a fear of being forgotten or of missing out on the opportunities granted to those with strong personal brands. But not wanting to keep up a personal brand is part of why I folded Rookie. Not paying attention to numbers is why I could enjoy it as a passion project for so many years. When the thought that I need to get back into the game grips me, I refocus on my work. Being paid to write and perform is what I wanted this whole time.\n\nI hope my system has helped me care less about being liked, but I don\u2019t expect ever to fully unlearn the inner salesperson or the shareability lens, nor do I necessarily want to. The never-not-branding feeling of being on Instagram \u2014 and the seeing the world as a reflection of your brand, which comes with it \u2014 can also be part of being an editor or curator. Knowing you could always end up writing about what you\u2019re experiencing is part of being a writer. Watching yourself within a moment can be part of acting and is certainly part of the self-promotion that comes with doing any of the above for a living.\n\nI think the internet is at its best when it\u2019s used to move forward in time. To repurpose the heightened level of self-awareness that it\u2019s taught me to creative ends. To be surprised by something outside of my control \u2014 like an audience. To learn and share and, though it sounds trite at this point, connect. Amid all the self-worth-measuring that has made up my experience of the internet, I believe there was also self-actualizing, and that there still can be.\n\nAt a Rookie book signing just last year, a 14-year-old asked me if it was okay to \u201cchange who you are even if it\u2019s different from who you are on your blog.\u201d My answer, of course, was \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nAct IV, The Relatable: Aspirational photos no longer perform as well as ones that feel #real. Photo: Eva O\u2019Leary\n\nEarlier this year, I decided to use Instagram to reacquaint myself with these possibilities. I paid attention to people who I thought looked like they were having fun on the app, like the comedian Chloe Fineman with her many ingenious impressions. One weekend in March, Ivanka Trump posted a sinister video of herself on Twitter, and I posted a video parodying it. It was widely circulated, and I\u2019m happy people found it funny.\n\nAfter noticing how few likes my posts of book excerpts or event fliers had gotten by comparison \u2014 like, so few that I thought people weren\u2019t even seeing them \u2014 I tried using the platform to test out a theory I\u2019d heard about Instagram\u2019s algorithm while fundraising for Rookie: that it prioritizes faces and videos in people\u2019s feeds over other types of content. (The feed isn\u2019t chronological but is sorted by an invisible algorithmic hand.) This notion encapsulated my agony over the idea that being a face, a personal brand, was the most likely way to get one\u2019s content seen on the oversaturated World Wide Web. I made a video of myself asking my followers to tell me where my video fell in their feeds, and many confirmed that they were seeing my new posts high in their feeds for the first time in months. They were divided on whether that was because Instagram explicitly favors certain types of data or because Instagram prioritizes, for each user, content similar to other content they\u2019ve liked.\n\nNot one to let a joke die without bludgeoning it, I spent a couple of hours walking around Times Square, filming myself searching for the algorithm \u2014 as in, backdrops that would perform well on Instagram. I tried the love sculpture and Angelina Jolie\u2019s wax figure at Madame Tussauds, and I hashtagged the videos #myalgorithmjourney.\n\nDoing these videos became a good exercise in making things, putting them out there, and moving on. I jotted down notes for characters and spent hours filming myself and editing the videos. I read most of the comments myself and learned that panic spirals are less likely when I like what I\u2019ve made and don\u2019t care if people hate it.\n\nSome commenters told me I had \u201csnapped\u201d or \u201clost it,\u201d and thousands unfollowed. Others were supportive and replied with jokes that made me laugh alone in my apartment, and I was sent back to the connective internet of my youth. Then I went off to a writing residency, then started acting in a new play, then stopped getting ideas, or at least none I wanted to spend hours executing. I learned that unless I put them up right away, I would get worried about the black hole. I would overthink and change my mind.\n\nAfter posting these videos, Eva Chen, Instagram\u2019s director of fashion partnerships, DM\u2019d me to come to the company\u2019s offices and learn how the algorithm works. There, two Instagram employees who said their jobs are mostly to \u201cmyth bust\u201d around the algorithm \u2014 at least to people like me, who have a big follower count \u2014 told me the algorithm does not explicitly favor faces or videos and mostly \u201cshows you more of what you already like,\u201d though they would not say how it measures data similarities. I don\u2019t know what it means that Instagram users like it when the people they follow post pictures of their faces. As a photographer friend pointed out, portraiture has always been the most popular genre of painting \u201cbecause people can read themselves into it.\u201d\n\nInstagram didn\u2019t share anything that isn\u2019t already public knowledge, except for an impressively detailed, NDA-protected packet with analytics on my account. The Instagram employees also told me that celebrities, models, and influencers had recently been coming to them wanting to know why their casual selfies outperform their posed red-carpet photos and editorial shots. Chen explained that aspirational photos did better a few years ago, but now users crave posts that seem to be behind-the-scenes, candid: \u201cPeople want to see you letting your hair down.\u201d\n\nForbes and a handful of social-media-marketing websites echo that appetites are changing. People are sick of unrealistic lifestyles and picture-perfect aesthetics, they say. The next era of Instagram is all about the \u201crelatable influencer,\u201d with trends like #nomakeup, #nofilter, #mentalhealth, #bodyimage, and \u201cInstagram vs. Reality\u201d memes. I now realize that in this essay, I\u2019ve hit five out of five.\n\nProduction Credits Photography by Eva O\u2019Leary\n\nSittings editors: Diana Tsui and Devine Blacksher\n\nand Makeup by Yuui Vision using Laura Mercier\n\nHair by Matthew Tuozzoli at See Management using Bumble and Bumble\n\n*This article appears in the September 16, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
