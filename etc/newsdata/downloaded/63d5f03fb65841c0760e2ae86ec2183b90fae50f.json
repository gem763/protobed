Consider Moving to One of These 3 Cities", "language": "en", "text": "Many workers spend years dreaming of the day they can finally retire, and for some, early retirement would be a dream come true.\n\nApproximately 60% of soon-to-be retirees say retirement will be the most liberating phase in their entire life, according to a survey from TD Ameritrade, and 50% of survey respondents said they would like to retire by age 60. However, while many workers want to retire that early, only a third said they expect to be able to do so.\n\nHammock on the beach in front of crystal blue water.

But another factor to consider is whether you can lower your costs in retirement. By living a less expensive lifestyle, you can retire earlier and live more comfortably without breaking the bank.\n\nGeneral living costs will likely be your most significant expense in retirement, and those costs are largely impacted by where you live. Move to one of these more wallet-friendly cities, and you may be able to save enough to retire early.\n\n1. Sun City, Arizona\n\nIf you're looking to move to a community designed specifically for retirees, you can't beat Sun City. The median home value in the city is around $180,000, according to Zillow -- much less than the median U.S. home value of $229,000.\n\nOnce you start collecting Social Security benefits, you won't pay any state income taxes on them in Arizona. While you shouldn't rely too much on Social Security in retirement, the tax break can help save some money.\n\nThe general cost of living is slightly higher in Sun City than the national average, but the city has plenty of activities for retirees. With various clubs, events, and other recreational activities, it's easy to keep yourself busy during retirement while sticking to a budget. And because you'll be surrounded by other retirees your age, it will be easier to make friends and find ways to stay occupied without spending too much money.\n\nThis is key if you're planning to retire early because you'll likely have decades of free time. If you spend all your free time traveling or learning expensive new hobbies, there's a good chance you'll blow through your retirement savings too quickly.\n\n2. Fort Meade, Florida\n\nThere's a reason why the Sunshine State is such a popular retirement destination. Not only does it have beautiful beaches and nearly year-round sunny weather, but Florida residents don't pay state income taxes on Social Security benefits -- making it one of the more tax-friendly retirement destinations.\n\nThere are several cities in Florida that make for ideal retirement destinations, but Fort Meade is one of the most affordable. The median household income is just under $60,000 per year -- nearly $20,000 more per year than the national average -- yet the city has a relatively low cost of living. The median home value in Fort Meade is just $108,000, and the overall cost of living is nearly 20% lower than the national average.\n\nA small town with a population of less than 6,000 residents, Fort Meade is a good option for those looking for a quieter retirement. Yet the city is also only an hour's drive from Tampa, so there are still plenty of entertainment options when you're itching to get out of the house for a day trip.\n\n3.
