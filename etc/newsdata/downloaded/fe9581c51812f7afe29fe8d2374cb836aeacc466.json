Following the game, some fans thought it would be appropriate to run over a Clayton Kershaw jersey in the parking lot.\n\nThe moment was captured on video by LZ Granderson of the Los Angeles Times, who decided to run over the jersey.\n\nDodger fans are running over a Kershaw jersey. pic.twitter.com/kDwYOg9xzA \u2014 LZ Granderson (@LZGranderson) October 10, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nKershaw was one of many Dodgers scapegoats from Wednesday\u2019s game. The 31-year-old Kershaw came on in relief with the Dodgers up 3-1 late in the game and gave up back-to-back home runs in the eighth inning that tied the game. The Dodgers went on to lose 7-3 in the 10th inning.\n\nKershaw wasn\u2019t the only person responsible for the loss. Reliever Joe Kelly gave up a grand slam to Howie Kendrick in the 10th that gave the Washington Nationals the win. Manager Dave Roberts was responsible for leaving both Kershaw and Kelly in the game.\n\nNo matter who you put the blame on, the practice of destroying jerseys is both stupid and childish. Kershaw has given Dodgers fans over 2,200 innings of exceptional baseball. He\u2019s a sure-fire Hall of Famer and carried the mantle of best pitcher in baseball for multiple seasons.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Kershaw has struggled in the postseason. Over 158 1/3 innings, Kershaw has an uncharacteristic 4.43 ERA. It\u2019s also true that without Kershaw\u2019s 2,200 regular-season innings, the Dodgers probably wouldn\u2019t be in position to contend for the World Series every year.\n\nStory continues\n\nKershaw didn\u2019t shy away from the moment. He spoke after the game, saying the loss will stick with him for some time. It doesn\u2019t help that fans were running over his jersey in the parking lot, but there\u2019s little doubt Kershaw will be ready again once spring training rolls around.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
