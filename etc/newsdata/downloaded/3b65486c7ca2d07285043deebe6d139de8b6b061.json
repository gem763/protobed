He lasted five months.", "language": "en", "text": "NEW YORK \u2014 Andrew Yang\u2019s office phone rang at 6 p.m. on a Friday.\n\nHe reached for it, then stopped. The staffing coordinator at his New York law firm was calling. If he answered, he knew, he\u2019d be at his desk all weekend editing some dull stack of documents.\n\nIt was fall of 1999, and Yang, 24, was in the job he had steered toward his whole life. Phillips Exeter Academy, Brown University, Columbia Law \u2014 the perfect elite track to land at Davis Polk & Wardwell, one of the country\u2019s premier law firms. His Taiwanese immigrant parents were thrilled. Counting salary and bonus, he was making about $150,000 a year.\n\nBut now he looked at the phone, and the nagging whisper in his head was suddenly a screaming alarm: He was in the wrong job. He wanted to be the person creating businesses and deals, not the person writing the contracts.\n\nHe let the phone ring and slipped out the door.\n\nThat small act of rebellion was his first step toward becoming Andrew Yang, entrepreneur.\n\nTwo decades later, Yang\u2019s norm-busting career as an Internet business builder is the foundation for his norm-busting Democratic presidential campaign. He evangelizes about what he\u2019s learned creating start-ups and nurturing businesses focused on the public good. His marquee policy \u2014 giving every U.S. adult $1,000 a month in guaranteed income \u2014 is the most un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox proposal of any major candidate.\n\nIt\u2019s the product of a nontraditional career, which began with his decision, in early 2000, to quit his law firm and walk away from all that money, prestige and comfort.\n\nHe frequently refers to his lawyer days as \u201cthe five worst months of my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorking at a law firm was like a pie-eating contest, and if you won, your prize was more pie,\u201d Yang said in a recent interview on the Acela train from Washington to New York, between hurried bites of a turkey sandwich.\n\nThe law jokes play well, especially because seven of the 12 candidates in the last televised Democratic debate have law degrees.\n\nBut quitting law was not really about walking away from something. It was more about running toward something else that was calling to him with a sudden, urgent clarity.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Shouldn\u2019t I be someone who builds something?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThat made more sense to me. But how do you get there? I figured there was no way to figure it out except to do it.\u201d\n\nSo just before the start of the new millennium, Yang and another refugee from his law firm created an Internet start-up to help celebrities use their fame to raise money for charity.\n\nIt flopped. He went broke, lost his apartment, lost weight and confidence, and wondered (along with his worried parents) how he was going to pay off $110,000 in law school debt.\n\nBut Yang was remaking himself.\n\n\u201cI have no regrets about not picking up that phone,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAndrew Yang, seated second from right, at what he calls \"nerd camp,\" a summer program for academically gifted kids run by Johns Hopkins University. (Courtesy of Andrew Yang 2020 Campaign)\n\nBookish and bullied\n\nYang, 44, is the son of parents who emigrated from Taiwan to the United States to attend grad school at the University of California at Berkeley. His father earned a PhD in physics, and his mother earned a master\u2019s in statistics and is now an artist.\n\nThey moved to Schenectady, in Upstate New York, where Yang\u2019s father accepted a job with General Electric then later worked for IBM. Yang was born on Jan. 13, 1975, and when he was 4, the family moved to Somers, N.Y., in Westchester County, then later to nearby Katonah.\n\nOne of few Asian kids in his town, he was bookish and bullied. He played Dungeons and Dragons, along with piano and tennis because his parents said colleges liked well-rounded students. His mother, Nancy Yang, recalled that Yang and his older brother, Lawrence, now a professor at New York University, played piano duets and regularly won local competitions.\n\nHis parents knew he was extremely bright but not especially motivated. They told him, \u201cIf you fail, it\u2019s because you didn\u2019t try hard enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cAndy once said to me when he was little, \u2018I really don\u2019t care about the grades. But I know you like me to get A\u2019s, so I get those A\u2019s for you,\u2019 \u201d his mother said.\n\nHis family prized education: In addition to his brother, his father, uncle and cousin also became professors.\n\n\u201cFor first-generation immigrants, the security of a job is the most important thing,\u201d Nancy Yang said. \u201cAnd we believe you need a good education to have a good job.\u201d\n\nWhen he was 12, his parents sent him to the Center for Talented Youth, which Yang calls \u201cnerd camp,\u201d a summer program for academically gifted kids run by Johns Hopkins University. He spent the next five summers there.\n\nTo qualify, he had to take the SAT, which students normally take when applying to college. He said he scored 1220 out of 1600 \u2014 better than most U.S. high school seniors that year. He said Johns Hopkins officials were so fascinated by his high score that they asked him to take the test in each of the next three summers.\n\nAt 13, he scored 1310, he said. At 14, he scored more than 1400. At 15, he scored more than 1500. When he was applying for college, he said, he didn\u2019t bother to take the SAT again because his score at 15 was good enough for even the most elite schools.\n\nWhen he was in 10th grade, a fellow camper told him about Exeter, the elite boarding school in New Hampshire. Yang thought it sounded like a great ticket to college. His parents gladly paid the college-level tuition, which he said was about $17,000 a year at the time.\n\n\u201cIt was something we hadn\u2019t planned for,\u201d his mother said. \u201cBut he told me, \u2018I want to be the best among the best, and I could really be the best there.\u2019 It was very difficult for me to say no.\u201d\n\nHe felt like an odd fit at Exeter, long seen as a preppy conveyor belt of establishment children. In a class photo from the time, Yang slouches in the middle of a crowd of mostly white kids in blazers and ties. He\u2019s wearing a floppy flannel shirt, his hands stuffed into the pockets of baggy jeans.\n\nExeter academics were rigorous, including classes on Saturdays. Yang made the U.S. national debate team and competed at the world championships in London.\n\nHe was accepted to Stanford University and Brown University and chose Brown because he preferred the East Coast and his brother was at nearby Wesleyan University. He cruised through majors in economics and political science and started looking for the next prestigious step.\n\nHe took the LSAT law school entrance exam and said he scored 178 out of 180 \u2014 in the top 1 percent. He became a double Ivy Leaguer when he was accepted at Columbia Law.\n\n\u201cI wanted to become a smart, successful guy, and law school seemed like a good way to go,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting another degree was going to happen sooner or later, so I thought I might as well do it now.\u201d\n\n\n\nAndrew Yang, back, at the wedding of his friend Sophia Ruan Gush\u00e9e, second from left, in 2004.\n\nSophia Ruan Gush\u00e9e, a close friend who met Yang at Brown and is also the daughter of Taiwanese immigrants, said Yang worked hard to please his parents.\n\n\u201cEverything he did was to check a box about what would make his parents happy,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why he did these really conventional, really impressive things.\u201d\n\nLawrence Wu, Yang\u2019s Columbia roommate, said Yang was smart enough to get good grades without working very hard. He said they both saw joining one of New York\u2019s \u201cBig Law\u201d firms as inevitable.\n\nTop-tier firms recruit heavily at the big-name law schools. Wu said he and Yang were both interviewed and wined and dined, and \u201cyou just naturally wind up falling into the gravity of that.\u201d\n\nThe big firms were all paying first-year associates $125,000 a year, plus bonuses could add tens of thousands of dollars more. Yang had borrowed almost $120,000 to pay for Columbia. So a Big Law salary was a smart way to \u201cget some return on investment,\u201d Wu said.\n\nWu and Yang both accepted offers from Davis Polk.\n\n\u201cIt really weighed on him that he wanted to do something purposeful with his life,\u201d Wu said. \u201cHe hadn\u2019t thought it through at that time. I think he thought, I\u2019ll try Big Law and get some return on investment. And go from there.\u201d\n\n\u2018Purposeless and empty\u2019\n\nYang walked into Davis Polk at 450 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan in September 1999.\n\n\u201cHe was pure energy,\u201d said Steven J. Williams, a Columbia classmate who also went to work at Davis Polk. \u201cHe was full of excitement. And you knew there was not a chance in hell that he was going to stay being a corporate lawyer for more than 15 minutes.\u201d\n\nWilliams, now a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, said, \u201cThere was too much he wanted to do. Too much he wanted to say.\u201d\n\nYang was assigned to a small office that he shared with Jonathan Philips, a recent graduate of Yale Law. Philips said Davis Polk\u2019s headquarters was elegant and \u201cseductively cushy.\u201d But he and Yang, the newest hires, shared a space with two desks and a window that looked out on a building next door.\n\nThey worked 80-plus-hour weeks reviewing documents and contracts, writing summaries for senior partners, running to the printer. They wore suits, ate meals in the firm\u2019s cafeteria and played basketball to unwind.\n\nNancy Yang said her son was suddenly paying more for a tie than her husband paid for a suit.\n\n\u201cIt felt very purposeless and empty,\u201d Yang said. \u201cI was looking out at New York and thinking, \u2018Wow, is this why my parents came to this country?\u2019 \u201d\n\nPhilips was recently married, his lawyer wife was pregnant, and he also had six-figure student debt. He also felt the pressure to stay on the safe and traditional track. But he said he and Yang constantly discussed whether the law firm was the right path for them.\n\n\n\nYang speaks at the Iowa State Fair in August. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nIt felt very purposeless and empty. I was looking out at New York and thinking, \u2018Wow, is this why my parents came to this country?\u2019 Andrew Yang\n\nYang said he did a \u201ctest\u201d with himself to see whether he was in it just for the money.\n\n\u201cI went to Bloomingdale\u2019s and bought my family cashmere scarves and some other nice gifts. Then I brought them to them that weekend, and they seemed to like them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I thought: Is this enough for me to do a job I don\u2019t like? Definitely not.\u201d\n\nHe knew the work would become more interesting as he became more senior. He liked the firm and the people there. But he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he ought to be building a company of his own.\n\n\u201cNo one there had the life and career that I wanted for myself,\u201d he said.\n\nYang said he went home for Thanksgiving and told his parents he was planning to quit.\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do about your debt?\u201d his mother asked.\n\n\u201cLet me handle it. You don\u2019t need to worry about it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe conversation ended there, but Yang knew why.\n\nWhen he started wearing an earring for a high school play at age 15, his mother didn\u2019t tell him how much she disliked it until he finally took it out two years later.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned over the years that if I hate something, I should just not talk about it, because if I do, you\u2019re just going to be more attached to it,\u201d she told him.\n\nHe said his parents \u201ctook that tack with my leaving the firm, too: \u2018If we just don\u2019t talk about it, maybe he\u2019ll change his mind.\u2019 \u201d\n\nYang remembers feeling bad because his parents had taken out a second mortgage to help pay for his education, and now they thought he was \u201call set\u201d because he had a prestigious, high-paying job.\n\n\u201cMy husband was not happy,\u201d Nancy Yang said. \u201cI had to calm him down. I was a little bit worried, too. But I feel kids have to make their own decisions.\u201d\n\n\n\nYang, left, poses with his father, mother and brother at his father's retirement party in 2000. (Courtesy of Nancy Yang)\n\nBroke and in debt\n\nLate one night at the law firm, Philips tried out an idea on Yang.\n\nDavis Polk supported many charitable causes, and tickets to star-studded charity galas were a perk of the job. Philips was amazed at how these black-tie events regularly raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for charities. But he was shocked to learn how much of that was going to the charities\u2019 administration and overhead.\n\nAt the dawn of the Internet age, Philips had already started one company \u2014 a college admissions consulting firm \u2014 when he was in law school. He closed it down to join Davis Polk.\n\nNow he had an idea for a better way to do celebrity charity: an online platform that would connect celebrities and their fans with the charitable causes they supported \u2014 with virtually no overhead.\n\nHe told Yang they should create a start-up to make it happen.\n\n\u201cAndrew just lit up,\u201d Philips said.\n\nIt was the idea Yang had been searching for \u2014 his own company, with a strong element of public good.\n\nThey called it Stargiving, and they started working through sleepless nights trying to refine the idea. They explained it to the partners at Davis Polk, who agreed to offer pro bono legal support to get it off the ground.\n\nYang and Philips soon faced a brutal choice. Stay or leave. Safe or risky.\n\nIn February 2000, five months after he joined Davis Polk, Yang quit.\n\n\u201cI was determined to figure out how to become the kind of person and builder I wanted to be,\u201d he said. \u201cMy parents hated it.\u201d\n\nYang had about $10,000 in savings. Rent for his studio apartment was $1,600 a month. He owed $1,200 a month on his $110,000 in student debt.\n\nHe started working in a \u201cshoe-box\u201d office he and Philips had rented for Stargiving. They raised a little capital from friends. Philips quit the law firm a couple of months later; he and his wife were living on her salary.\n\nFive months later, Yang was broke and maxing out his credit cards. He gave up his apartment and moved in with a high school friend.\n\nHe went to Los Angeles to meet with potential investors and stayed with his friend Gush\u00e9e, now an author who writes about health issues, who said she felt terrible because Yang \u201cseemed really, really poor. He was so thin.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was thinking, \u2018You\u2019re nuts,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cBut he was so excited and so determined. He just fell in love with this start-up idea, this dream.\u201d\n\nGush\u00e9e said she recognized how hard it was for Yang to disappoint his parents.\n\n\u201cTaiwanese immigrants are very risk averse,\u201d she said. \u201cThey value financial security, and they want you to be a doctor or a lawyer. It\u2019s not easy for an Asian man to walk away from that.\u201d\n\n\n\nYang meets with President Barack Obama and other \"Champions of Change\" at the White House in 2012. Yang was recognized for the work his nonprofit Venture for America does to support start-ups and entrepreneurs. (Pete Souza/The White House)\n\nStargiving had some success for a while, then crashed as the tech bubble burst and was out of business by 2002. Yang moved on to other ventures \u2014 including a party-organizing business \u2014 with mixed success. He eventually ran a business school test-prep company that earned him \u201cin the low millions\u201d when it was sold in 2009 (and allowed him to pay off his student loans). In 2011, he founded Venture for America, a successful incubator for start-ups across the country that supports other entrepreneurs.\n\nPresident Barack Obama named him a \u201cChampion of Change\u201d and a \u201cPresidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship.\u201d Yang wrote a book about his experiences called, \u201cSmart People Should Build Things.\u201d\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t regret studying law, which made him more \u201cstructured and detail oriented.\u201d On the other hand, he said, the cautious analysis taught in law school can get in the way of an entrepreneur who needs to make decisions quickly, often based more on instinct than data. He said he had to \u201cunlearn\u201d some of what his law professors taught him.\n\nYang is now a kinetic presence in the Democratic race, though he lags behind the front-runners in the polls. On the morning of his interview on the Acela, he had appeared at a climate forum at Georgetown University. When he was introduced, he hopped off the stage and sprinted along the front row, high-fiving the cheering students.\n\n\u201cEven though Stargiving bombed, it was still a very invigorating, energizing process,\u201d he said on the train, posing for selfies with supporters who recognized him.\n\n\u201cIt was a period of soul-searching,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was easy to feel like a bit of a failure. You\u2019re doing jobs that nobody understands. You\u2019re not making as much money as your friends. But you have to try. It\u2019s the only way anything worthwhile ever gets built.\u201d", "description": "Walking away from wealth and prestige dismayed his immigrant parents.
