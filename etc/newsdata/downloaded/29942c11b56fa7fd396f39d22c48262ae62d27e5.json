His versatility across the backline will add an extra dimension to the All Blacks but it\u2019s his unique range of skills which make him truly deadly: quick, a sublime distributor and kicker, a superb tackler and an unmatched reader of the game, there\u2019s a good reason Barrett has twice been named World Rugby Player of the Year.\n\nPast Record\n\nChampions at the 1987, 2011 and 2015 World Cups.\n\nPrediction\n\nThe standard is high among their rivals but, assuming they can avoid upset against South Africa in their opening group game, and in doing so set the tone for the rest of their tournament, New Zealand are my bet to emerge victorious at this year\u2019s World Cup.\n\nFixtures\n\nSaturday 21 September \u2013 New Zealand vs South Africa (10.45am BST), Yokohama\n\nWednesday 2 October \u2013 New Zealand vs Canada (11.15am), Oita\n\nSunday 6 October \u2013 New Zealand vs Namibia (5.45am), Tokyo\n\nSaturday 12 October \u2013 New Zealand vs Italy (5.45am), Toyota\n\nOdds\n\nNew Zealand to win the World Cup: 5/4", "description": "The reigning world champions, New Zealand once again head to the World Cup as favourites to lift the Webb Ellis Trophy.
