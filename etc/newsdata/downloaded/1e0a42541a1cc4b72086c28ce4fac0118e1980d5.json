Serves what they want in the dinner hall with glasses of milk, so why is packed lunch different?\n\n\"There is absolute uproar about it.\n\n\"It's not nice to have a child with allergies but instead of upsetting everyone, and like he says it's life-threatening, he needs to make sure the kids who have these life-threatening allergies are in their own safe area to eat what they want.\n\n\"We as parents are absolutely enraged. We give our children school compliant juices for their dinners as a lot of our children don't like water.\n\n\"It's like we are back at school ourselves, there's always some daft rule in place.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nParents have been told the new rule will come into play after October half-term.\n\nThe mum added: \"Teachers also unscrew children's water bottles and smell the water to make sure there's no other sort of drinks been given.\n\n\"We got a newsletter last night saying that after half term, all children who are packed lunch will only be allowed water with their dinners due to various allergies.\n\n\"The school canteen serves milk, dairy products etc. It's like our children are being penalised because of other kids' allergies.\n\n\"People in restaurants aren't told to only drink water because there's an allergy sufferer in the restaurant. What if you're walking past someone eating a Snickers for example? Life can't be stopped for everyone.\"\n\nIn a statement of response to parents' concerns, Mr Huckstep said: \"St Andrew's like most schools are developing our 'Healthy Bodies/Healthy Minds' approach.\n\n(Image: hulldailymail.co.uk)\n\n\"Reducing sugary drinks and improving attitudes towards healthy bodies is a national project, as you are aware.\n\n\"Linked with this is our care of those growing number of children with allergies.\n\n\"Our water policy - instigated on an idea by parents - was initiated 15 years ago.\"\n\nMr Huckstep also added that the school has alternative provisions for children who cannot drink water for medical reasons and said he's received messages of support from parents since announcing the extension to the policy.", "description": "Headteacher has said pupils bringing in packed lunches won't be allowed any other kinds of drinks with their food", "authors": ["Dan Kemp", "Image", "Getty Images", "Hulldailymail.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728256.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Little-boy-drinking-water-from-a-glass-indoors.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
