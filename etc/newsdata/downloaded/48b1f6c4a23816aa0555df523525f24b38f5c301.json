Documents seen by CBC News say Ortis was in contact with Phantom Secure, a company run by Canadians that supplied encrypted phones to criminals around the world. (Sketch by Laurie Foster-MacLeod for CBC News)\n\nSecurity documents seen by CBC News say an FBI investigation in 2018 found Ortis had emailed Ramos. It is alleged that Ortis contacted Ramos to offer him \"valuable\" information.\n\nOrtis was arrested last week on charges under the Security of Information Act.\n\nPleaded guilty, got nine years\n\nRamos pleaded guilty in an American court to racketeering conspiracy and was sentenced in May to nine years in prison.\n\nFour of his associates, Canadians Younes Nasri, Michael Gamboa and Christopher Poquiz, and Kim Rodd, who has joint Australian-Thai citizenship, are still being sought by American authorities.\n\nThe conviction followed a joint investigation by the FBI, the Australian Federal Police and the RCMP that carried out 25 searches in the United States, Australia and Canada.\n\nPolice estimate the group made more than $80 million providing international criminals with secure communications systems between 2008 and 2018.\n\n\"Phantom Secure's devices were specifically designed to prevent law enforcement from actively monitoring the communications between members of transnational criminal organizations,\" prosecutors wrote in the indictment.\n\n\"As part of its services, Phantom Secure guaranteed that messages stored on its devices could be (and would be) remotely deleted by the company if the device was seized by law enforcement or otherwise compromised.\"\n\nModified Blackberry phones\n\nAt the heart of the system was Canada's iconic Blackberry.\n\nPhantom Secure took the Blackberry phones, installed sophisticated encryption software and routed the data through encryption servers located in countries the company believed were unco-operative with law enforcement.\n\nPolice estimate that in 2018 there were at least 10,000 Phantom Secure devices in use worldwide, with users paying $4,000 a year for the service.\n\nBut not just anyone could buy these phones. Prospective customers had to be vouched for by an existing client, which prosecutors said helped restrict Phantom Secure's customer base to those who wanted to use the device for criminal activity.\n\nProsecutors said Phantom Secure maintained its servers in Panama and Hong Kong, using proxy servers to further disguise the location of its servers.\n\nThe company helped drug trafficking and money laundering in Australia, Asia, Europe, the United States and Canada, concealing its proceeds through cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nElizabeth Thompson can be reached at elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca", "description": "The\u00a0investigation into top RCMP official Cameron Ortis\u00a0began with a shadowy Vancouver-based company and\u00a0a multimillion-dollar business that helped drug traffickers and money launderers around the world.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter", "Award-Winning Reporter Elizabeth Thompson Covers Parliament Hill.
