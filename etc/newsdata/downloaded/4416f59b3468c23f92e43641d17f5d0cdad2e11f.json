Ilhan Omar, a Somali-born freshman lawmaker the president has repeatedly lashed out at on Twitter and cast as the one of the faces of the Democratic party.\n\nOmar, who won 78% of her district in 2018, enjoys wide support in her hometown of Minneapolis. The city is preparing to greet the president by holding a massive protest outside Target Center in downtown Minneapolis, where he will speak Thursday.\n\nThe president's rally comes a day after a Fox News poll released Wednesday night that found 51% of voters support impeaching Trump impeached and removing him from office, a new high since the House began an impeachment inquiry into allegations he pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nTrump weighed in on the poll Thursday, saying \"Whoever their Pollster is, they suck.\"\n\nThousands are expected to attend the Minneapolis protest, which will center on fighting Trump's anti-immigration policies and what critics see as divisive rhetoric, according to Giselda Guiterrez, an organizer with Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee (MIRAC), which is coordinating the demonstration with other local activist groups. She expects a large turnout among the city's diverse community.\n\nIIhan Omar, a member of AOC Plus 3, will win us the Great State of Minnesota.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019\n\nLGBTQ voters: 'Trump is a reaction to our great progress': LGBTQ voters looking for change in 2020\n\nMinnesota, which is home to a large Somali immigrant population, also has the largest number of refugees per capita nationwide, with 13% of the country's refugees, according to U.S. Census data.\n\n\"We just want to have a strong community presence of thousands of people that oppose the president's message of hate against every marginalized community that he's attacked one way or another,\" Guiterrez said.\n\nShe said she expects Trump to upbraid Omar during the rally since she is \"a constant focus of his Twitter.\"\n\n\"He will attack her for sure, and that's going to bleed into attacking the community here in general.\"\n\nOmar acknowledged in a tweet Thursday she expects Trump to attack her, but added it wouldn't stop her from her work in Congress.\n\nTrump will see his rally in my district today as an opportunity to attack me. But no smear will ever stop me from working toward what I\u2019m in Congress to do:\n\n\n\n\u2705 Pass Medicare for All\n\n\u2705 Raise the minimum wage\n\n\u2705 Repeal the Muslim ban\n\n\u2705 Enact a Green New Deal\n\n\u2705 Impeach Trump\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) October 10, 2019\n\nTrump:: As Turkey pounds Syria, Trump downplays ties to Kurds: 'They didn't help us in the Second World War'\n\nBut the battle for Minnesota began well before Omar was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018. Minnesota, which hasn't elected a Republican president since Richard Nixon in 1972, narrowly voted for Hillary Clinton by 1.5% in 2016. Trump, who lost by a margin of 44,000 votes, has indicated he thinks he can close that gap in 2020.\n\nAccording to Republican National Committee (RNC) officials, the campaign has built out a training program since 2016 that counts nearly 1,000 local volunteers across the state as part of the Trump Leadership Victory Initiative. Republicans have focused much of their attention on rural parts of Minnesota, where the GOP flipped two congressional seats during the 2018 midterm election.", "description": "Ahead of his visit Minneapolis, Donald Trump has amplified his attacks on Rep.
