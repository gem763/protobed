Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) called the offensive \u201cmisplaced and very unfortunate,\u201d and said he had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Vindman \u201cas an individual and his patriotism.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe response from Trump\u2019s party created an unusual dynamic in which Republicans were defending a man who was simultaneously accusing the president of undermining national security for his own political purposes. Privately, several Republicans found Vindman\u2019s testimony to be damaging and lamented that once again they were forced to defend the president.\n\nThe GOP reaction to Vindman comes as the party faces frontal attacks on two of its major talking points in Trump\u2019s defense. Vindman\u2019s account of the phone call deprives Republicans of the complaint that the witnesses called by Democrats have relied on hearsay when discussing the president\u2019s interactions with Zelensky. And as Democrats moved to vote on a resolution to hold open hearings on impeachment, Republicans faced the prospect of losing their complaint that the inquiry is being conducted in secret.\n\nThe resolution, set to come before the full House on Thursday, would empower Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) to take the lead on public hearings. It would also enable House Republicans for the first time to make requests before Schiff\u2019s committee for testimony and documents \u2014 a practice that matches the minority-party powers in the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans have raised questions about Trump\u2019s right to be personally represented by attorneys during the impeachment proceedings, noting that Clinton had lawyers present during the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s consideration of articles of impeachment in 1998. The committee on Tuesday issued a three-page summary of procedural safeguards for the president. They include the right of the president or his counsel to recommend additional testimony or evidence for the committee\u2019s review and to question any witnesses who testify, among other provisions.\n\nSeveral Democrats said they believed the vote would undermine Republicans, who for weeks have raised objections to the process Democrats have undertaken and have called for a formal vote on launching impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cThe message this week is going to be: You asked for it, you got it,\u201d said Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAcross the Capitol, Senate Democrats plotted their own offensive on Trump and his dealings with Ukraine. They planned to use a Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing on Wednesday to press Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan on why he recalled the former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Sullivan has been nominated to be U.S. ambassador to Russia.\n\nDemocrats want to question Sullivan about his treatment of Yovanovitch, who was the target of a smear campaign by Trump allies because she did not subscribe to conspiracy theories about Ukrainian efforts to undermine Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nIn the House, impeachment investigators are readying for a marathon session Wednesday, when they\u2019ll hear from two Ukraine specialists in the administration \u2014 the State Department\u2019s Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson. But on Tuesday, Democrats were eager to question one more Trump administration official worried about the president\u2019s move to leverage foreign policy on a promise to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn his testimony over more than 10 hours, Vindman said he was listening in on the summertime call between Trump and Zelensky from the Situation Room, along with other NSC officials and members of Vice President Pence\u2019s office.\n\nVindman said he was so worried about Trump\u2019s request that Zelensky investigate his political foes that he reported it to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel, just as others at the NSC did at the direction of John Bolton, the former national security adviser who found the Ukraine pressure unsavory.\n\n\u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d Vindman told lawmakers. \u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVindman also testified that the rough transcript of the July 25 call released by the White House is slightly different than what he remembers transpiring. For example, Vindman recalled Zelensky specifically referencing the Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma when Trump pushed him to investigate a company related to Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who had served on its board. Vindman also remembers Trump going on about how Joe Biden was on tape boasting about Ukraine funds \u2014 most likely referring to comments Biden made in January 2018 that the United States held up $1 billion in loan guarantees until the nation fired a corrupt former prosecutor, Victor Shokin.\n\nMultiple officials described Vindman\u2019s additional testimony on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly.\n\nAsked about Vindman\u2019s testimony, congressional Republicans squirmed, tried to disagree politely or flat-out dodged. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said that while he thanks Vindman for his service, \u201che is wrong.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have differences of opinion, but more importantly, we have a rule of law. . . . Nothing in that phone call is impeachable,\u201d McCarthy said, later adding: \u201cI do not question this man\u2019s service to the country, but you know what, people have different philosophical beliefs.\u201d\n\nDemocrats described the testimony of Vindman and others as crucial in the abuse-of-office case.\n\n\u201cI think the big picture here is, we\u2019ve talked to a lot of people who are firsthand, direct participants in various aspects of the story. And with every new witness, it becomes harder to deny the facts, and it\u2019s become more embarrassing to the president\u2019s conduct because it reaffirms the central details\u201d of a quid pro quo, said Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), an Intelligence Committee member.\n\nAD\n\nShortly before Vindman arrived on Capitol Hill, Trump tweeted his attacks, echoing criticism leveled by his allies.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSupposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call \u2018concerned\u2019 today\u2019s Never Trumper witness. Was he on the same call that I was? Can\u2019t be possible!\u201d Trump wrote hours after Fox News\u2019s Laura Ingraham suggested Vindman was a double agent. \u201cPlease ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt!\u201d\n\nRepublicans rejected the attacks on the Iraq War veteran who has served as a military officer and diplomat for over two decades under Democrats and Republicans.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t at all question his patriotism. I respect his service. He\u2019s a Purple Heart, and I think it\u2019d be a mistake to attack his patriotism,\u201d said Sen. John Thune (S.D.), the No. 2 Republican in the Senate.\n\nAD\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who oversees Eurasia affairs on the Foreign Relations Committee and traveled with Vindman to Ukraine for Zelensky\u2019s inauguration in May, said \u201canybody that served this nation and put themselves at risk is a patriot in my book.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cProbably not real smart,\u201d Johnson said of questions about Vindman\u2019s patriotism.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the No. 3 House Republican and a fiery defender of the president, opened a Tuesday GOP news conference calling such comments \u201cshameful\u201d and beneath the dignity of Republicans.\n\n\u201cI think that we need to show that we are better than that as a nation,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about decorated veterans who have served this nation, who have put their lives on the line. And it is shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this nation, and we should not be involved in that process. . . . We don\u2019t do that as Republicans.\u201d\n\nOther Republicans were more disturbed by what Vindman described in his testimony. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), an advocate for Ukraine, said, \u201cI thought it was inappropriate for the president to ask a foreign government to investigate a political opponent.\u201d But Portman also added: \u201cI also do not think it\u2019s an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nWhile Republicans were forced to answer for Trump, House Democratic leaders worked behind closed doors to ensure their members easily deliver the votes for passage of the resolution.\n\nIt didn\u2019t appear that Democrats would have problems garnering the votes despite near-unified Republican opposition. Even moderate Democrats from conservative districts, such as Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), were on board. \u201cI have no qualms about taking a vote,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been clearly in an impeachment inquiry, and laying out the plans for the next step, I think, is a helpful thing to do for the American people to understand the parameters of the public hearings,\u201d said the freshman, who is seeking reelection in a district Trump won by seven percentage points in 2016.\n\nRep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.), a veteran lawmaker whose district voted for Trump by five points, also said he planned to support the measure: \u201cWe fully support a thorough investigation, and we\u2019re going to continue doing what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nBut at least one Democrat said he planned to vote no, citing the upcoming presidential election.", "description": "After President Trump\u2019s allies questioned Purple Heart recipient Alexander Vindman\u2019s patriotism, Republicans found themselves defending an impeachment witness who testified that the president pressured Ukraine to investigate his rivals and undermined national security.", "authors": ["Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "Seung Min Kim", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NKiGtWWNRELRWmDs2LsjvmXO75Q=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MRXSR3H2RMI6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
