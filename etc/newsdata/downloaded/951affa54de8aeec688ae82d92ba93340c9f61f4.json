There are, and we cannot stress this enough, zero stakes. (Carson having a temper tantrum over wine decanters aside. Retirement doesn\u2019t change a man!) Except when you start doing some basic math and realize the film jumps ahead to 1927. The following passage-of-time hard truth might wash over you: Oh God, the Dowager Countess is pretty old, innit? Will she \u2026 you know \u2026 survive? To give you peace of mind, Vulture can definitely, absolutely confirm that the Crawley matriarch (Maggie Smith, a dame to kill for) doesn\u2019t die in the film. However, it\u2019s implied that her death is imminent, and a new era of Downton will soon be forging forward without her.\n\nTo sum up, the Dowager Countess embarks on a trip to London early in the film, and she demures on the sojourn\u2019s purpose whenever prompted by someone in the family. That is, until her granddaughter, Mary (Michelle Dockery), sniffs out in one of the final scenes that her dear \u201cGranny\u201d is being unusually coy about her travels, which causes the big revelation to occur: She had numerous medical tests performed, and the results are dire.\n\n\u201cI may not have long to live. It won\u2019t be too quick, but of course you can never get a London doctor to be precise,\u201d our eternally witty Countess says. \u201cSave your tears for something sad, because there\u2019s nothing sad here. I have lived a privileged and an interesting life, and now it\u2019s time to go. I\u2019m leaving the family and the place that I treasure in talented hands.\u201d In a particularly poignant moment, she tells Mary that she\u2019s \u201cthe future of Downton,\u201d and demands no one else know about her illness for fear of being treated differently. \u201cOur ancestors lived different lives than us, and our descendants will live differently again, but Downton Abbey will be a part of them,\u201d she adds. \u201cYou\u2019ll take over for where I left off. You\u2019ll be the frightening old lady, keeping everyone up to the mark. You will, my darling, and you\u2019ll do it wonderfully. You\u2019re the best of me, and we\u2019ll all live on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I shall prefer to rest in peace,\u201d she concludes. May all days be lived like upper-class weekends in her honor.", "description": "The biggest question for the Downton Abbey film is whether the Dowager Countess (Maggie Smith) dies.
