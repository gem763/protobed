Durant made an All-NBA first team and two All-NBA second teams. Usually, when a player and team reach anywhere near that level of shared success, they stick together.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBut Durant, who signed with the Nets, left the Warriors this summer.\n\nWhy?\n\nDurant, via J.R. Moehringer of the Wall Street Journal:\n\n\u201cI came in there wanting to be part of a group, wanting to be part of a family, and definitely felt accepted,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019ll never be one of those guys. I didn\u2019t get drafted there.\u2026 Steph Curry, obviously drafted there. Andre Iguodala, won the first Finals, first championship. Klay Thompson, drafted there. Draymond Green, drafted there. And the rest of the guys kind of rehabilitated their careers there. So me? Shit, how you going to rehabilitate me? What you going to teach me? How can you alter anything in my basketball life? I got an MVP already. I got scoring titles.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs time went on,\u201d he says, \u201cI started to realize I\u2019m just different from the rest of the guys. It\u2019s not a bad thing. Just my circumstances and how I came up in the league. And on top of that, the media always looked at it like KD and the Warriors. So it\u2019s like nobody could get a full acceptance of me there.\u201d\n\nHis tenure in the Bay Area was great, he says, but because of media speculation, fan anxiety, \u201cit didn\u2019t feel as great as it could have been.\u201d\n\nThis is a sound assessment. It\u2019s a toned-down version of the report he felt disrespected with the Warriors, but it still hits similar notes.\n\nStory continues\n\nDurant was never going to be as beloved as his teammates who lifted the franchise from the cellar to a championship before he arrived. He just didn\u2019t have that type of equity with the fan base.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that so many assumed Golden State would\u2019ve won the 2017 and 2018 titles even without Durant. Nearly all champions are appreciated. But to many, Durant felt superfluous.\n\nAnother complication: Durant preferred a different offensive system to the one other Warriors, including coach Steve Kerr, favored. That led to analysis that naturally separated Durant from the rest of the team, which trickled into feelings of greater divide.\n\nIf Durant wanted to have a comfortable fit, he could\u2019ve re-signed with the Thunder. He was royalty in Oklahoma City. It sounds like he doesn\u2019t regret leaving, though.\n\nHe also could\u2019ve been instantly beloved by signing with his hometown Wizards. He didn\u2019t sound interested in that, either.\n\nMaybe it\u2019ll be different in Brooklyn. Unlike the Warriors, the Nets were only just beginning to establish their identity when he arrived.\n\nBut he still comes with baggage \u2013 the notoriety of ring chasing with the team that eliminated him the prior season, having already established his greatness elsewhere, a torn Achilles that could keep his play from meeting expectations. At minimum, Durant will never be the homegrown star in Brooklyn. At worst, he\u2019ll never be a star at all in Brooklyn.\n\nMost likely, he\u2019ll find a middle ground. Will he be happy in it? I\u2019m not sure. It at least sounds like he has learned how to handle those circumstances.", "description": "Kevin Durant's time with the Warriors was both extraordinary and extraordinarily short.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ILbczNARdv6elVgbyJQ9Cw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gAsCn4xfT2VUms1lER1RhA--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/d73b74f77a0a1c02f0ed8e2c10fb3b74", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
