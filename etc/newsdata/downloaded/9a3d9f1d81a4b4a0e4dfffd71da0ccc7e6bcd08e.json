The misconduct was brought to light thanks to an investigation from NASA\u2019s inspector general, the FBI, and the Air Force\u2019s office of special investigations.\n\nThe man, James Smalley, was a quality assurance engineer at PMI Industries, a machining company in Rochester, New York that makes various aerospace parts. In January of 2018, SpaceX directed the firm SQA Services to do an internal audit, which found that numerous PMI inspection reports and test certifications \u2014 used to confirm the safety and quality of a part \u2014 had forged inspector signatures on them. Specifically, Smalley allegedly photocopied signatures of the SQA inspector and then copied and pasted them onto the reports.\n\n\u201cAccording to the criminal complaint, James Smalley took the act of forgery to a new level.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the criminal complaint, James Smalley took the act of forgery to a new level,\u201d Gary Loeffert, an FBI Buffalo special agent-in-charge, said in a statement. \u201cA potentially catastrophic level with the potential to not only cost millions of dollars, but also jeopardize years of irreplicable work.\u201d\n\nSmalley is accused of tampering with up to 38 reports of critical parts used in SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rocket line, according to the US Attorney\u2019s Office in the Western District of New York. The investigation also found that up to 76 PMI pieces had either been rejected during inspection or never inspected at all; they were sent to SpaceX anyway. All in all, up to 10 of SpaceX\u2019s government missions may have been affected by the suspect parts, including seven for NASA, two for the Air Force, and one for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Some of the falsified reports even revolved around parts meant to be used in the launch of NASA\u2019s new exoplanet-hunting spacecraft, TESS, in April of 2018. However, NASA\u2019s inspector general had been alerted to the forgeries before the launch.\n\nIf convicted, Smalley could face up to 10 years in prison, as well as pay a $250,000 fine, according to the US Attorney\u2019s Office.", "description": "A man from upstate New York has been charged with providing false inspection reports and test certifications for parts used in SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, as well as vehicles from other aerospace contractors employed by the Defense Department.", "authors": ["Loren Grush", "May"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qzN8LnaOuYUUcVaisj-Ub_31iLM=/0x0:3749x1963/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8943747/691967420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-23"}
