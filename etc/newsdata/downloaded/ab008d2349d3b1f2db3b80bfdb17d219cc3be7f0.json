His stirring, player-assisted 69-yard \u201ctouchdown\u201d that day became something of a phenomenon, helping raise awareness of pediatric brain cancer, with which he had been diagnosed two years prior.\n\nIt has been more than six years since what his family refers to as \u201cthe run.\u201d Jack, now an eighth-grader, stands at 5-foot-8 these days. This month, he made his true debut on the gridiron, playing center for the West Holt Junior High football team in Atkinson, Neb.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of kids like me that would kill to play in a football game,\u201d Jack Hoffman, 13, said in an interview. \u201cIt was really nervewracking \u2014 I was about the same level of scared that I was for the run \u2014 but once you get playing you forget all the scaredness.\u201d\n\nThe West Holt Huskies won, 38-0, on Sept. 16, and the game went smoothly for Hoffman, who continues to undergo treatment for a tumor next to his brain stem. He started chemotherapy after his 2011 diagnosis and participated in a clinical trial when it began to grow again in 2014, according to his father, Andy Hoffman.\n\n\n\nJack Hoffman takes the field with the Nebraska football team on April 6, 2013.

The targeted therapy has helped, according to his dad \u2014 a recent MRI revealed the tumor is stable \u2014 but Jack is still required to take about 21 pills a day, including medication to treat epilepsy.\n\nThe side effects are minimal, however, and he\u2019s able to play sports with his classmates.\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t realize when he did that 69-yard run that he was between standard chemo treatments; it happened to be an off week.\u201d Andy Hoffman said. \u201cYou can have a functional life with standard chemo, but [the clinical trial] is good stuff. His day-to-day health, he\u2019s like you and me.\u201d\n\n\u2018Spur of the moment\u2019\n\nJack Hoffman\u2019s famous touchdown run was a joint effort by Nebraska\u2019s players and staff, including running back Rex Burkhead, who now plays for the New England Patriots. Burkhead had befriended Jack and become an advocate for the Team Jack Foundation, which has raised more than $8 million for pediatric brain research.\n\nAs a lifelong Cornhuskers fan, Jack was thrilled to be an unofficial member of his favorite team. Even at age 7, however, he yearned to be on the field. Nebraska\u2019s players and coaches wanted to make it happen, too. It was just a matter of when.\n\n\u201cIt was spur of the moment,\u201d Taylor Martinez, starting quarterback for the Huskers at the time, recalled in an interview, adding there was no specific plan for young Jack to enter the game that day.\n\nWhen it became clear it was happening, the Cornhuskers drew up a simple play that would have Jack run to the right and beeline toward the end zone.\n\nMartinez called out a cadence and carefully handed the ball to Jack, who wore a much smaller version of Burkhead\u2019s No. 22 jersey. The 7-year-old ran in the wrong direction at first but Martinez grabbed him to readjust his route. Then Jack took off for nearly 70 yards.\n\n\u201cIt was an unbelievable experience. I\u2019m getting chills talking about it,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cNever before have I heard a crowd erupt like that.\u201d\n\nThe run resonated with others, too. Hoffman won an ESPY award in 2013 for \u201cBest Moment\u201d and got to meet former president Barack Obama in the Oval Office. Six years later, Martinez said he\u2019s not surprised to see Jack live out his dream for the Huskies. Jack plays the center position, Martinez noted, which requires toughness, smarts and an acute ability to read the opposing team\u2019s defense.\n\n\u201cThe look in his eyes as we were drawing up the play for him, you could see he\u2019s a fighter and would continue to fight every day and get out there on the football field,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any doubt he\u2019d be back out there again.\u201d\n\nJack is not coddled or treated differently than any other teenager in the rural town of Atkinson, his father and coach said, and his peers have already watched him play basketball, baseball and run track. He always wanted to play football, but the decision to participate in a much more physical sport required careful consideration.\n\n\u201cThe contact was the concern, the helmet-to-helmet, the concussions,\u201d his father said. \u201cMany of Jack\u2019s doctors said, \u2018we don\u2019t think anyone should play football.' \u201d\n\nBut that notice came with an asterisk: Jack was told he could play, as long as his parents approved. Andy Hoffman discussed the issue at length with his wife.\n\nThey ultimately determined their son should make the call.\n\n\n\nJack Hoffman, pictured above with his father, was 7 years old when his touchdown run in a Nebraska spring game went viral. Now a teenager, Hoffman is playing football. (Brianna N. Hoffman via AP)\n\nA \u2018blessing\u2019 to play\n\nAndy Hoffman was not sure if Jack would see the field in his first game. But at 170 pounds, No. 75 stood taller than many of the other players whenever he prepared to snap the ball.\n\nIt was a surreal moment for his father, who became depressed upon Jack\u2019s initial diagnosis in 2011. Fearing the worst outcome at the time, Andy Hoffman could only think about the things his son might never be able to do: Drive a car. Go to prom. Play sports.\n\n\u201cFootball was always one of those things,\u201d Andy Hoffman said. \u201cYou think about those things and how thankful you are to the good Lord, it\u2019s such a blessing.\u201d\n\nWhile he was elated to finally watch his son play, Andy Hoffman said he couldn\u2019t stop looking for signs. Jack had suffered seizures in other sports before \u2014 like that time in sixth grade when, disoriented, he walked in the wrong direction as nine other basketball raced down the court.\n\nBut Andy Hoffman finds comfort in his son\u2019s teammates and coaches, who he says are able to intervene when necessary.\n\n[How Michael Vick's dogfighting case changed animal welfare]\n\n\u201cThis community has wrapped its arms around him. They know when he\u2019s going to have a seizure,\u201d Andy Hoffman said. \u201cThey\u2019ll grab him by the hand and take care of him \u2014 that\u2019s part of the decision to let him play, knowing his teammates are sweethearts and have his back.\u201d\n\nAndy Hoffman is also cognizant that Jack\u2019s story is not the reality for many parents of children with pediatric cancer. Nearly 16,000 children are diagnosed with cancer in the United States each year, according to the American Childhood Cancer Organization. Twenty percent of children with cancer do not survive it, and Andy Hoffman is frustrated by how many of them are unable to participate fully in normal childhood activities..\n\n\u201cWe have forgotten about our kids with cancer. That\u2019s not a red issue or a blue issue; that\u2019s a humanity issue,\u201d he said. \u201cJack should not be the exception, this should be the rule for kids [with] brain cancer, period.\u201d\n\n[As spread offenses take over football, some coaches gain an edge by going traditional]\n\n\u2018A lot of pressure\u2019\n\nWest Holt Coach Andy Osborne summed up Jack\u2019s style of play in a single word: \u201canimal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some running backs that enjoy having him at center,\u201d Osborne said with a laugh, emphasizing Jack\u2019s size. \u201cThe kids weren\u2019t the only ones excited when he was ruled okay to play. There\u2019s nothing more a coach likes than a kid from the opposing team being driven down the line.\u201d\n\nBut what Hoffman brings to the team goes far beyond his blocking technique, Osborne said. In many ways, his peers have rallied around him.\n\nIn the Huskies\u2019 first full-contact practice about two weeks before their inaugural game, it was up to the students to decide who would lead the team break. It\u2019s an important job that includes a comment on the day\u2019s practice and notes on how the team must improve.\n\nWhen the Huskies circled up and put their hands in the middle, Jack\u2019s teammates called on him to lead the charge. He was named team captain for their first game.\n\nRecalling the practice, Jack said he enjoys being a leader \u2014 for the most part. He\u2019s learned quickly that the role comes with \u201ca lot of pressure.\"\n\nHe looks forward to taking on that challenge, too.\n\nRead More:\n\nUCLA-Washington State was a wild reminder: Really young people play football\n\nThe Scottish Hammer: How Jamie Gillan went from Scotland to an HBCU to Browns rookie standout\n\nAntonio Brown says he\u2019s done with NFL, blasts Robert Kraft and Ben Roethlisberger\n\nU.S. women\u2019s national team star Megan Rapinoe, Coach Jill Ellis win FIFA\u2019s top honors\n\nThey were once sent home for their Olympic protest.
