Those images of her, most of which came from moments with Trump or after meetings with him, have become symbols of the Democratic resistance to the president and of women in power more broadly. Her clothes, her hand gestures, her facial expressions \u2014 they\u2019re all \u201cAnd nevertheless, she persisted,\u201d personified.\n\nLet\u2019s run through the memorable examples of how Pelosi has burnished her legacy through images of her interactions with Trump.\n\nThe red coat and sunglasses\n\nFirst came this December 2018 meeting, involving the most powerful politicians in the country, that devolved into a heated argument. In the Oval Office. In front of cameras.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNancy\u2019s in a situation where it\u2019s not easy for her to talk right now, and I understand, and I fully understand that,\u201d Trump said at one point.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMr. President, please don\u2019t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory,\u201d Pelosi responded.\n\nThen, these images:\n\nThe new power suit for women.\n\nRed coat. Sunglasses. Nerves of steel. Intelligence. #Pelosi pic.twitter.com/oymDvYcyK3 \u2014 Wendy McClelland (@wendyweb47) December 12, 2018\n\nHere\u2019s how The Washington Post\u2019s Colby Itkowitz described it for The Fix then:\n\nOver 10 minutes of a surreal public sparring match in the Oval Office, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi tried mightily to rise above the bluster and ego that erupted between the men in the room. But Pelosi (D-Calif.) instead had to listen as President Trump mansplained to her the legislative process and her role in the debate, while Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer talked over her to trade barbs mano a mano with Trump. Yet Pelosi emerged from the meeting not some wilted flower, but a symbol of a woman who doesn\u2019t have time for male posturing. A photo of her departing the White House, dressed in a red coat and putting on her sunglasses, instantly became a meme.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a manhood thing for him,\u201d Pelosi privately told Democrats after that meeting. \u201cAs if manhood could ever be associated with him.\u201d\n\nThe red jacket, like the blue one she wore Wednesday at the White House, was unapologetically bright. Her aides have said she always wears a jacket and sunglasses outside when it\u2019s cold. Almost a year later, she put it on again to be photographed for Vanity Fair\u2019s December magazine by famed celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz, who followed her around for two days on Capitol Hill.\n\nAD\n\nIn another telling photo for that Vanity Fair spread, Pelosi is surrounded by three Democratic lawmakers who are leading the impeachment inquiry, all wearing dark suits. She\u2019s in a canary-yellow dress and matching necklace, balancing three tubes of makeup in front of a mirror that resembles back stage for a Broadway star. She is prepping for the camera in a way men don\u2019t have to \u2014 and doing it all while appearing to provide guidance to the men around her.\n\nAD\n\nThe State of the Union clap-back\n\nIt\u2019s February 2019. Democrats have just won back the House for the first time in almost a decade, and that means Pelosi is seated behind Trump as he gives his State of the Union address. Her every move is on display. Trump had a line that got a rare bipartisan standing ovation, on rejecting the \u201cpolitics of retribution.\u201d\n\nShe appears to be following along with his speech on paper and jumps up when he says this. She claps. But she extends her arms when she claps, almost locking her elbows out, in an effort to gesture her clap at the president. Her eyes are wide and pointed. She is most clearly pointing at the president (notice a theme?), telling him with her body language to listen to his own words. It\u2019s a warning in a clap.\n\nThe speaker\u2019s gavel\n\nA month earlier, Pelosi officially became speaker again, still the only woman in U.S. history to hold the title. In a ceremony in the House to officially begin the new Congress, wearing a coral-colored dress that jumped off the TV screen, she grabbed the wooden speaker\u2019s gavel and took the oath of office, surrounded by children, many of them her grandchildren. Again, Pelosi was speaking to many American women in that moment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt created an image that denotes not only making history, but also a perspective on this role and her power that aligns with experiences of women, of being a mother and grandmother,\u201d said Kelly Dittmar, a gender and politics expert at Rutgers University. \u201cShe embraced these identities along with her political identity.\u201d\n\nPelosi has had lots of practice at effectively using cameras and images to convey meaning. She\u2019s been in Congress for more than three decades, in leadership for 16, and is one of the most photographed politicians in the country.\n\nShe is comfortable in the space she\u2019s in, said Elshami, her former chief of staff. And her clothes reflect that. Research shows that female politicians are more scrutinized for their appearance than men. They have to be likable to win votes, whereas men don\u2019t, necessarily. And the clothes women wear, their hair and makeup, play a big role in coming across as likable. On the flip side, women also have many more ways to express themselves. Men\u2019s main power accessory is the same, day in, day out: a suit and tie. For a woman, the mere aspect of wearing pants is a statement of power. So is color, and jewelry and pointed heels.\n\nBeyond the clothes, Pelosi is often one of the only women in the room at the highest levels, which is particularly resonant in the #MeToo era, in which women are celebrated for standing up and standing out.\n\nThe pointing photo\n\nIn a tweet Wednesday, Trump, as he often does, leaned on stereotypes about gender to insult a woman he feels threatened by. He tweeted this photo of his contentious meeting with Pelosi, captioned \u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s unhinged meltdown!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHer response was to make it her cover photo on Twitter. Where Trump saw weakness, Pelosi and her team saw strength. And we can see why. She already stood out in a bright blue jacket amid a room mostly full of graying white men in shades of dark blue and gray. She\u2019s the only one standing. And to top it all off, she\u2019s pointing at them \u2014 at the president, specifically. It\u2019s not enough for her to be the only woman at a powerful table, Dittmar said. She\u2019s also portraying a gesture of aggressiveness to the most powerful man in the world and his allies, men who are all listening to her, looking either demure or demoralized. The photo symbolized that she is in control. And she recognized it the moment Trump tried to weaponize it against her.\n\n\u201cAny woman knows what it\u2019s like to be the only woman in the room,\u201d Dittmar said, \u201cso having it not only be an image where she\u2019s just one woman alone at the table, but also where she is clearly engaged in a conversation in which she\u2019s taking the lead in the conversation, that\u2019s indicative of power.\u201d\n\nPelosi told the New Yorker in an interview Saturday, before the White House meeting, that she relishes these moments: \u201cI do believe everything he says is a projection of himself. He calls me \u2018Nervous Nancy.\u2019 I know he\u2019s very nervous. \u2026 Any knock from him is a boost to me.\u201d\n\nShe told reporters Thursday morning that she was \u201cprobably saying \u2018all roads lead to Putin.\u2019\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The pointed finger.
