I've been able to push on and get back fit.'\n\nQueue 3.3 million sighs of relief. The Lions man of the series from 2017 will win his 80th Test cap on Sunday having missed the France quarter-final.\n\nHe is still not quite 100 per cent right, but could not watch this one from the sidelines.\n\n'You look back on your career and you play hurt quite a lot,' Davies added.\n\n'I have every confidence in my knee. I am probably not where I want to be, which is quite frustrating, but I know I can go out there and do a job and that's all my goal is this week.\n\n'It's one of those games you don't want to miss.'\n\nDavies says that he has 'every confidence' in his knee as he looks to make a major impact\n\nThe injury happened against Fiji. Off Davies went, careering through the outside centre channel, fending off Jale Vatubua and flicking a pass out the back of his left hand to Josh Adams, who completed a hat-trick that saw Wales win in Oita.\n\nBut the tackle before his pass had his mind racing. Having ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee twice before - the latter blow ruling him out of the last World Cup - Davies' tournament flashed before his eyes.\n\n'I didn't really feel it happen,' Davies explained.\n\n'I just remember that when Josh scored I got up and I felt a weakness in my knee and I was like \"What's this?\"\n\n'Josh was being seen to by the two physios, so I stumbled over and saw Geoff Davies the doctor.\n\n'It was sore when he was testing it and I did fear the worst to be honest. I'd like to think I know my own body quite well and I did have a bad feeling - thankfully I don't know it too well!\n\n'When scanned, initially it was an interpretation from a Japanese radiographer, so we couldn't we really take what he said fully until it was sent back to the UK and two radiographers back there could see it.\n\nThe 31-year-old suffered the injury against Fiji and revealed that he didn't feel it happen\n\n'Once he said it doesn't look like there is too much damage the outlook was far better. We could be a bit more aggressive with the treatment and the rehab. It reacted quite well.\n\n'I've done my ACL as well so initially my fear was that that could be the problem. That's structurally fine.\n\n'It was good news with the scan but quite a stressful 24 hours or so.'\n\nAnd a stressful week too. Having trained fully last Wednesday, and had a day off last Thursday it was the Friday before the France game that things changed.\n\n'I stopped on the team run,' Davies said.\n\n'I didn't even get going really. It was a case of ice up and compression for the next 24 hours to see if the swelling would go down.\n\n'On the morning of the game me and Prav Mathema (Medical Manager) did a few drills to see if I could get up and running, but I could tell I wasn't right.\n\n'Prav could see it as well and it was a case of everyone has worked too hard for me to go into the game selfishly just to play in a quarter-final.\n\n'We made a decision that it was probably best for the team if I didn't play.. Thankfully the boys got the job done, but it was absolutely savage watching. It was terrible.'\n\nDavies admitted that it was 'so stressful' to watch Wales' victory against France\n\nDavies was put through the ringer as Wales came back from 19-10 down at half-time against France to win 20-19 and book their place in the semis.\n\n'It was just so stressful,' said the centre.\n\n'I probably aged a couple of years! My family said \"That's what we feel at every game\" so I had a taste of that!\n\n'The boys dug in well, didn't give up, and did enough to get the win.\n\n'It was huge relief. I had another week to get back fit and get back in the team.' Davies' knee will be heavily strapped.\n\n'I know there has been a lot made of the strapping, but it's a case of hopefully there being two games left of the season essentially,' he explained.\n\n'Everyone is banged up. You have to do everything you possibly can to get yourself right for some of the biggest games in your career.' He has had a lot of titanic Tests in his 10 years wearing Welsh red, but Davies reckons he has only really enjoyed three of the 79 so far.\n\n'The Grand Slam this year when we had a comfortable lead, Lions final Test against Australia in 2013 and probably the 30-3 win over England,' he listed.\n\n'They're probably the only three but I'll take them!\n\n'If we're up by 20 points then I can enjoy it. But it's going to be so close, we're going to have to remain focused.\n\n'That moment of joy will hopefully come after the final whistle.\n\n'The occasion is great - the build-up, the bus ride, the anthems. They are the things you take in.\n\nDavies believes that Wales have the quality to get the better of South Africa on Sunday\n\n'But once the game begins, you haven't got time. The game is so quick.'\n\nAll of Wales will be delighted Davies is back for the big one - but now focus switches to delivering.\n\nAnd this squad, more than any that has come before it, believes.\n\n'We've competed against and beaten some great teams,' said Davies.\n\n'You know that you've been to a dark place and you've been able to come out the other side of it.\n\n'It's going to be a big one. I'm going to love it. It's down to us 23 boys to go out there and make sure that we're still fighting for another week.\n\n'It's been a hell of a ride, but everyone is excited for one last week on the rollercoaster that is Welsh rugby.'", "description": "Jonathan Davies has the answer to the question on every Welsh fan's lips.
