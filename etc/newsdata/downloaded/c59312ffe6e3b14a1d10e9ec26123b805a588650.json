The fighting has prompted a flood of Kurdish refugees out of Syria \u2014 and caused a political headache for the president, who has been accused by Republicans and Democrats alike of abandoning U.S. allies in the region.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe aid group\u2019s founder, Dalton Thomas, said the reasons behind the cancellation were \u201chazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll we know is they canceled,\u201d Thomas, who is in Saudi Arabia, said via text message.\n\nA second official with the religious group, administrator Charlene Struebing, said Trump International Hotel staff expressed \u201csecurity concerns.\u201d Critics of FAI\u2019s decision to hold its event at the Trump hotel had planned to protest outside, she said.\n\n\u201cThey said they\u2019ve gotten a lot of security concerns and they couldn\u2019t accommodate enough security,\u201d Struebing said. \u201cI think it\u2019s more related to people protesting our event than it was anything we were doing.\u201d\n\nThe Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAD\n\nA D.C. police spokeswoman said the department \u201chas not received any information regarding potential security threats or concerns with this event.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s presidency, his hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue has become a favorite hangout for his Republican allies and a venue for conservative events and conferences. Attorney General William P. Barr has booked a holiday party for 200 people at the hotel in December that could generate more than $30,000 in revenue for Trump\u2019s business.\n\nFAI leaders said their goal was not to fund the Trump Organization but rather to use the venue to raise awareness about the Kurdish plight and transcend partisan differences. Still, the backlash to their choice of venue was swift.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been bombarded with emails and responses on social media and phone calls of people who are understandably confused by why we would choose to do [the event] at this location, at Trump hotel, which is owned by the president who made this decision that is causing so much bloodshed and turmoil right now for the Kurds,\u201d Thomas said in an online video that was posted Sunday.\n\nAD\n\nThomas and another leader of the group, Joel Richardson, explained that the intention was to show \u201chonor and respect and humility\u201d for the office of the president while also being \u201chonest about what\u2019s taking place\u201d with the Kurds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re commanded as followers of Jesus to pray for and honor leaders. And so this is the approach we\u2019ve chosen to do that,\u201d Richardson said in the video. \u201cWe are going to, if you will, the president\u2019s living room, and we\u2019re doing our best to have an honoring, respectful, family discussion.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe added that since \u201cevery news story somehow ends up being all about Trump\u201d that it would be good publicity for the issue.\n\nAfter the cancellation, Thomas said: \u201cIt\u2019s their prerogative to cancel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a shame they used that prerogative though as this was an opportunity for the Trump administration,\u201d he added. \u201cIt seems as though they set out to \u2018[snatch] defeat from the jaws of victory\u2019 this month on everything.\u201d\n\nThomas said that the Trump Organization had refunded the group\u2019s money and that FAI now planned to hold the event at the Grand Hyatt Washington hotel on Sunday.\n\nAD", "description": "The group said it wanted to use the venue to raise awareness about the Kurdish plight and transcend partisan differences.", "authors": ["Joshua Partlow", "National", "Foreign Affairs.
