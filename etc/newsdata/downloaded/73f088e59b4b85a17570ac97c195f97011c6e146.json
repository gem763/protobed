The New York Federal Reserve said late Tuesday that it would carry out a second overnight repo operation on Wednesday ($75 billion in repos), after Tuesday\u2019s $53 billion funding.\n\nThe actions come ahead of an important policy decision by the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee at 2 p.m. Eastern Wednesday and raises some questions about the state of Wall Street\u2019s financial plumbing, as the central bank is expected to reduce rates by a quarter of a percentage point and communicate its future monetary-policy plans to stave off the harmful effects of a Sino-American trade war and a creeping global economic slowdown.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell is slated to host a news conference a half-hour after the policy makers\u2019s decision is released.\n\n\u201cThe Fed are tipped to lower rates, but given the US economy is broadly in good health, there is an argument the central bank should hold fire on lowering interest rates,\u201d wrote David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, in a daily research note. \u201cThe US employment rate is close to a 50-year low, core [consumer-price index, a key inflation measure] is rising, plus wages are robust, so the Fed have justification for keeping rates on hold,\u201d he said.\n\nInvestors also have been keyed in on Middle East developments after Saudi Arabia\u2019s key oil-processing hub was momentarily hobbled over the weekend by reported drone and missile attacks.\n\nThe attack initially caused the Brent price BRNX19, -1.30%, the international benchmark, to rise 15% on Monday, the biggest single-session rise on record dating back to 1988, but U.S. benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate grade CLV19, -1.65% traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and Brent oil have been giving up much of their historic gains as Riyadh has signaled that its plans will come back on line sooner than originally feared.\n\nAnxieties around the attacks in the Arabian Peninsula have elevated tensions between the U.S. and Iran, where the drones and missiles are believed to have originated, but markets likely will focus on central bank moves over the next 24 hours absent any fresh escalation.\n\nOutside of Fed updates, investors are looking out for data on August housing starts\u2014 the number of new homes on which construction has begun \u2014 due at 8:30 a.m.\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nShares of FedEx Corp.
