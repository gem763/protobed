Their instantly recognisable sound impacted on musicians as diverse as Geri Halliwell and New Order's Peter Hook.\n\nTheir third album, Whatever Gets You Through The Day (2001) produced Top Ten single (I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be) Free/One, an inspired mash-up of the U2 anthem and soul classic made her own by Nina Simone.\n\nAfter the two friends went their separate ways but discussions of coming together to produce their long-awaited fourth album started three years ago. The pair were determined to make something that was classic Lighthouse Family, but also sounded like it could be made today. Blue Sky In Your Head is Lighthouse Family's fourth album and sees them back on Polydor Records (their original label) and reunited with Colin Barlow, the A&R that discovered them, and Keith Armstrong, their first manager; the same team that was around them when they were at their FM Radio-dominating peak.\n\nTICKET INFORMATION:\n\nTickets go on sale Thursday 31 October at 09:00.\n\nDiscovery Cardholders get an exclusive 48-hour presale from 29 October 2019 at 09:00.\n\nGo to Discovery's website for more information.\n\nTOUR INFORMATION:\n\nJohannesburg\n\nDates: 20 and 21 March 2020\n\nVenue: Teatro, Montecasino\n\nTicket Price: From R630\n\nTickets available from Big Concerts' website starting on Thursday 31 October at 09:00.\n\nCape Town\n\nDate: 24 March 2020\n\nVenue: Grand West, Grand Arena\n\nTicket Price: From R515\n\nTickets available from Big Concerts' website starting on Thursday 31 October at 09:00.\n\nCompiled by Alex Isaacs.
