Defense officials said that affected embassies also were being notified.\n\nRelated video President Trump has declared a national emergency to fund a barrier at the border with Mexico.

Democrats have vowed to not re-appropriate money for the affected military projects.\n\nThe diverted funding would be used to build or replace 175 miles of wall construction along the U.S.-Mexican border, defense officials said. Construction could begin as soon as three months from now on land owned by the Pentagon along the border, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller Elaine McCusker told reporters Tuesday. Wall construction on other government or private land would begin later, Ms. McCusker said.\n\nArmy Lt. Gen. Andrew W. Poppas, director of operations for the Joint Staff, said the Pentagon anticipated that some of the roughly 5,000 active duty and National Guard troops now at the border could leave as construction projects are completed. But he said he couldn\u2019t provide details over how many troops would be leaving or when.\n\nPresident Trump declared a national emergency in February, ordering government agencies to search for a total of $6.7 billion they could divert from military and other projects toward border-wall construction. That allowed him to skirt Congress, which had signaled it was willing to give him significantly less. In July, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision that Mr. Trump had the authority to order such a transfer.\n\nWrite to Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com, Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com and Nancy A.
