If your shoulder is ahead of your hands, then the law doesn\u2019t allow for you very well.\u201d\n\nThe fear pre-tournament is that a number of pool matches could be decided by red cards, which would have a subsequent impact on which teams progress to the knockout stages of the World Cup. The recent World Rugby Under-20s Championship saw four red cards and 13 yellow cards blight the competition, with a decision taken not to implement the same high-tackle trial that was experimented with during that tournament for the World Cup.\n\nBut World Rugby chief Alain Rolland still visited every team in the lead up to Japan 2019 to talk over how high tackles and contact with the head will be officiated in order to try and bring some clarity to the regulations.\n\nEngland head coach Eddie Jones was one of the most outspoken voices in the wake of New Zealand lock Scott Barrett\u2019s red card during the Rugby Championship, which came when he made contact with his shoulder on the head of Wallabies captain Michael Hooper. Jones described the decision as \u201cridiculous\u201d and called on World Rugby to start using common sense when making judgements on players attempting to clearout rucks as the second man, and Mitchell believes those comments have been listened to.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see the panels or groups use a little more common sense around the occurrence,\u201d added Mitchell, \u201cso I guess that\u2019s all you\u2019re after because with a lot of the situations actually the intent is not illegal, but sometimes the speed or ability from height alone is quite challenging.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an extension of what they already had because there was a lot more focus previously on just the tackler, but now you\u2019ve got the second man where there can be mitigating circumstances with him as well.\n\n\u201cAt the back of everyone\u2019s mind, if you go back to the U20s World Championship there was a lot of cards issued there. There is some apprehension around that, it\u2019s probably not something that has been talked about but you are just going to have to deal with whatever happens. There will definitely be some apprehension around, \u2018OK, is it actually going to be like that?\u2019. You\u2019d like to think that since then there has been learning, a little bit more common sense and you do hear the words \u2018mitigating circumstances\u2019 because when that adjudication or sanction comes, it then goes to another process to see how dangerous it was.\u201d\n\nThat said, England will still come up against a Tongan side whose reputation precedes them. The three Pacific Island sides are among the most physically testing teams in the World Cup, though previously that has at times seen their discipline let them down as individuals tend to go \u2018headhunting\u2019 in the hope of battering opponents into submission.\n\nMitchell believes that could be a bigger weakness at this World Cup than before given the punishments that will now come with tactics if they are mistimed, with much more scrutiny put on high tackles and dangerous clearouts thanks to the powers of the television match official.\n\n\u201cThe sides that haven\u2019t spent time on that height and that tackle technique and have left it to remain liberal, that could become costly,\u201d Mitchell added. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly an important part about our process and we make sure that we train it in the way that it\u2019ll give us an advantage, but ultimately at the end of the day we understand the head is a no-go zone.\u201d", "description": "England\u00a0defence coach John Mitchell has admitted that captain Owen Farrell has been forced to adjust his tackling technique in fear of a flurry of red cards at this year\u2019s Rugby World Cup.
