With our fake news media currently on a rampage to overturn the 2016 presidential election with a relentless caravan of lies and fraud, Eastwood knew a timely subject matter when he saw one.\n\nDuring the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia, 34-year-old Richard Jewell was working security when he discovered a suspicious package. Risking his own life, Jewell evacuated the area before the bomb went off.\n\nOne person was killed in the blast, dozens were injured, but were it not for Jewell\u2019s bravery and instincts, the death toll would have been unthinkable.\n\nWhat happened next at the hands of the FBI, the national media, and the late-night comics was one of the most disgusting episodes I can remember.\n\nBecause he was white, because he lived with his mother (she was ill), because he wanted to be a cop, and because he was a southerner, the feds, the media, and the Jay Lenos targeted this hero for personal destruction.\n\nWorking hand in hand with the Deep State FBI, the media smeared Jewell as a pathetic, mama\u2019s boy who planted his own bomb so he could be a national hero, and the late-night comics eviscerated him as a fat, dumb, southern-fried mama\u2019s boy.\n\nGee, any of this starting to sound familiar?\n\nThis very public torturing of Jewell, this destruction of an everyday man without a hint of evidence against him, went on for nearly three interminable months before the monsters were forced to admit they fingered the wrong man.\n\nEastwood\u2019s movie arrives in theaters December 13, and as you will see in the just-released trailer, he pulls no punches.\n\n\u201cJewell fits the profile of a lone bomber,\u201d a representative from the fake media says, \u201ca frustrated white man who is a police wannabe who seeks to become a hero.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running it,\u201d says her editor.\n\nRunning it. Based only on a profile. No facts. No evidence. No proof. Nothing concrete. Just narrative, narrative, narrative \u2014 just bigotry and hatred toward an \u201cother.\u201d\n\nAnyone getting George Zimmerman-Covington Kids-Darren Wilson-Duke La Crosse-Brett Kavanaugh-University of Virginia-Russia Collusion-Ukraine Hoax flashbacks?\n\nThere was no happy ending to this story. Jewell successfully sued NBC News and CNN (sound familiar?), but he died aged 44 having never completely recovered from being twisted into a national pariah and joke.\n\nOne happy ending would have been our media learning a lesson. But as the 20-plus years since prove, the media\u2019s destruction of this innocent man was just a test run.\n\nWhile you\u2019re waiting for the movie, be sure to read Marie Brenner\u2019s superb 1997 Vanity Fair article \u201cAmerican Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell,\u201d the movie\u2019s source material.\n\nGod bless Clint Eastwood.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
