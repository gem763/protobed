Why? Well, according to some, the moment felt like a pretty obvious joke about Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who was arrested for solicitation at a Florida spa earlier this year. However, as Brady explained to reporters Saturday, people chose to take the scene \u201cout of context\u201d and also, that\u2019s not how television production timelines work.\n\nIn the scene, Rudd gasps as Brady saunters from Top Happy Spa to his car. \u201cFirst time?,\u201d the quarterback asks him. \u201cUh-huh. You?,\u201d Rudd replies. Says Brady with a smile, \u201cSixth,\u201d an obvious reference to his six Super Bowl wins. \u201cIt was agreed to a year ago. It was written four years ago,\u201d Brady said of the scene, according to CNN. \u201cAgain, it\u2019s unfortunate that people would choose to think I would ever do something like that about Mr. Kraft. I think that\u2019s a very bad assessment of my relationship with him. I would never do that.\u201d\n\nStill, even Living With Yourself creator Timothy Greenberg himself assumed Brady wouldn\u2019t want to do the cameo after Kraft\u2019s February arrest at a spa that looked very similar to the one in the show. \u201cLike, I would have used it as a reference photo,\u201d Greenberg told Refinery29 last week. \u201cSo we\u2019re like, \u2018Alright, this is clearly not going to happen now.\u2019\u201d In retrospect, probably should have lined up that season two cameo while the show still had the chance.", "description": "Patriots quarterback Tom Brady denies his massage parlor cameo on Netflix\u2019s new Paul Rudd TV show Living With Yourself is a Robert Kraft joke.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/20-Tom-Brady.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
