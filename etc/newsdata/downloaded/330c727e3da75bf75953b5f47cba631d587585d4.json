With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin.

However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to.

Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant.

Getty\n\nThe House impeachment inquiry was announced last month and House members have been conducting interviews as part of that investigation since. Should they choose to proceed, Democrats would introduce formal articles of impeachment and probably conduct further hearings in public.\n\nDemocrats are looking into whether Mr Trump inappropriately used his office to put pressure on the Ukrainian government to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, a potential political rival in the 2020 general election. And, although the White House has attempted to block top State Department officials from testifying about their interactions with the White House in relation to Ukraine, a string of high-ranking officials have chosen to cooperate anyway, raising significant concerns for the president.\n\nAmong those who have cooperated with the probe is Bill Taylor, the top diplomat to Ukraine, who testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. Mr Taylor, according to his prepared remarks to the committee that have since been leaked to the press, indicated that the White House had expressed explicitly that $391 million in military aide to Ukraine was contingent upon Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky announcing publicly that his government was investigating the Bidens. Mr Trump has accused Mr Biden, without proof, of abusing his power as vice president in order to benefit the Ukrainian oil company Burisma, which at the time employed his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nThat testimony \u2014 alongside closed-door remarks from America\u2019s EU ambassador Gordan Sondland and former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch \u2014 has raised alarm among Republicans in Washington, many of whom have told reporters in recent days that they are struggling to defend Mr Trump in light of revelations like those from Mr Taylor that allege a quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cHow do you defend the indefensible?\u201d one Republican source told CNN following Mr Taylor\u2019s testimony. \u201cWe can\u2019t defend the substance, all we can do is talk about process.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The efforts, which were largely dismissed as a political ploy to distract and derail the testimony, was led by Trump ally and representative Matt Gaetz. The gambit sought to draw attention to the apparent secrecy of the testimony, even though several of the Republicans would have been able to sit in on the testimony since they are members of the committee conducting the hearing.\n\nMr Graham\u2019s continued support for the president comes after the two publicly clashed over Mr Trump\u2019s decision to pull American troops out of Syria, which was and continues to be seen as a decision that has put American-allied Kurdish fighters who helped fight back against Isis at risk. That decision, while technically unrelated to the Ukrainian fiasco, was widely derided by Republicans in Congress, and raised the prospect that they could be pushed to abandon the president just as he faces down perhaps the toughest political fight of his career.\n\nThe resolution\u2019s support in the Senate shows that it remains unlikely that the president would be removed from office, as it would require two-thirds of the Senate to convict Mr Trump on impeachment. Democrats could, however, vote to impeach Mr Trump with a simple majority in the House.", "description": "Lindsey Graham has lashed out at the Democrat-backed impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives, calling the effort to indict Donald Trump \u201cout of bounds\u201d and a danger to the American presidency.", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/24/16/lindsey-graham.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
