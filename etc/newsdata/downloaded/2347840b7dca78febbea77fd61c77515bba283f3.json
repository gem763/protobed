A fee-free spending card is wise, but is exchanging in advance or locking into rates essential, and would you even stash your holiday cash in gold?\n\nWe get some tips and look at some of the accounts can help.\n\nAs Brexit looms travelers are getting more concerned about losing out in the event of the Pound falling even more than it already has\n\n1. Brexit proofing through gold\n\nWould you keep your holiday cash in gold? One provider, Tally has launched a banking app that offers individual banking accounts where you can save and spend in physical gold both at home and abroad.\n\nSavers have long considered gold a 'safe-haven' in times of economic and political uncertainty.\n\nThe banking platform explains that when customers make a deposit through the app, they are buying Tally gold at the global wholesale price, which is kept in a secure vault in Switzerland. One Tally is equal to one milligram of physical gold.\n\nThe money can be accessed through the Tally bank accounts linked to a contactless Mastercard debit card. Tally says: 'Customers use Tally to spend anywhere that accepts Mastercard, with no fees.'\n\nThe platform does, however, apply a single monthly charge of 0.1 per cent of the average monthly holding, which it says covers storage, security, insurance and operational costs.\n\nPhil McHugh, of Currencies Direst says that Brexit-induced fall in the pound is not the only reason for the strong performance of gold, which is traditionally denominated in US dollars.\n\nHe says: 'Gold has been the star performer and is a natural winner when uncertainty and risk is high.\n\n'Gold is currently marching to test six year highs and its rally is supported more by global trade tensions between the US and China than Brexit.\n\n'The price of gold looks set to continue to rise given recent escalations in US/China trade relations, and anyone looking to hold gold should be aware of possible price rises in the coming months.'\n\nTally's app is available on the App store or Google Play store.\n\nPhil McHugh of Currencies Direct says the Pound could fall even further in a no-deal scenario by as much as five to 10%\n\n2. Consider exchanging ahead of your holiday\n\nAashna Shroff, personal finance expert at money.co.uk says: 'If you're travelling over the next month, it could be worth buying some of your travel money now to mitigate potential currency fluctuations.'\n\nAccording to McHugh the pound could fall even further in a no-deal scenario by as much as five to 10 per cent. However, it won't do badly against all currencies.\n\nMcHugh explains: 'The pound's fall has been more painful versus currencies that do well in a risk-off environment such as the US dollar, Swiss franc and Japanese yen.\n\n'It's not all bad news \u2013 the pound has actually held similar levels versus the Australian dollar when looking back over the last year and gained against the Swedish krona, Turkish lira and South African rand.'\n\nTo get the best deal, it's important to monitor the exchange rates closely. McHugh says: 'Transferring \u00a31,000 into euros back in March would have netted you roughly \u20ac1,170, whereas the same transfer in July would have been worth around \u20ac1,100.\n\n'As you can see it really pays to keep an eye on exchange rates and try and time your transfer for when it is most favourable for you.'\n\nExchanging money at the airport could end up costing you more. Consider making an exchange now if you find a good deal on the exchange rate\n\n3. Ditch your debit card\n\nAccording to Defaqto, a financial information business, the most expensive way for travellers in Europe to spend is by using their debit cards.\n\nIt admits there are a few cards that don't charge, but with the convenience of contactless, you could easily rack up charges if you have a card that does.\n\nDefaqto says: 'A daily \u20ac5 breakfast of coffee and a croissant over a fortnight could end up costing a whopping \u00a321 in addition to the \u20ac70 spent on your breakfast.\n\nUsing your debit card is the most expensive way for travellers to spend, according to Defaqto\n\n4. Use your credit card\n\nIf you prefer to use a card, Defaqto refers to the credit card as 'the hero of holiday spending'.\n\nThe company claims that credit cards can be as cheap as cash and also provide holiday makers with consumer protection relating to anything purchased between \u00a3100 and \u00a330,000.\n\nDefaqto points out: 'An evening meal costing \u20ac25 could cost travellers between 46p and 68p. In comparison, the same payment using a debit card could cost between 40p and \u00a31.88.'\n\nThe credit card has been described by Defaqto as the 'hero of holiday spending'\n\n5. Don't draw cash abroad\n\nMaking withdrawals abroad is usually very expensive. Shroff says: 'If possible, avoid drawing money out of a cash machine whilst overseas.\n\n'Not only will your pound not go as far as it used to, but you are also likely to be hit with charges for using the ATM.'\n\n6. Pay in advance\n\nIf you're booking a hotel or hiring a car, consider paying for these in advance and you could save money.\n\nShroff says: 'Many operators will give you the option of reserving these services and not paying until you arrive or check-out, but by paying in advance, you will know what the trip will cost you, without any surprises from currency fluctuations.'\n\nConsider using these current accounts for spending when you are abroad in Europe as they have no debit card fees\n\n7. Avoid expensive pre-paid cards\n\nYou can load foreign currency on pre-paid cards and transact with relative ease. However, according to Defaqto, they come with a few disadvantages too. Most of them have high fees and there are other catches like loading or renewal fees.\n\nDefaqto says: 'Some (e.g. Asda) have very expensive non-Sterling exchange fees and should be avoided. Also, many cards cannot be used for car hire, and customers might also have difficulties at petrol stations, where payments often cannot be pre-authorised.'\n\nMany prepaid cards come with high fees and other catches like loading or renewal fees according to Defaqto\n\nIt added: 'Of the 58 Sterling or Euro denominated pre-paid cards studied by Defaqto, only five have no fees for adding money, no service charges, no transaction fees, and no renewal or dormancy fees.\n\n'Some (13 out of 72) prepaid cards charge a fee to load money onto the card from a debit card \u2013 typically two per cent. Another six charge a flat fee of 50p or \u00a33 to load money onto the card.'\n\nAvoid withdrawing money from ATMs if you are holidaying abroad as this can be more expensive than swiping your card\n\n8. Watch out for any news on negotiations\n\nIt's a Mexican stand-off between the UK and Europe, when it comes to Brexit. However, things could change for the pound if the UK and the EU do decide to sit around a table and talk about a new deal.\n\nMcHugh explains: 'If the UK and EU do start negotiating and reach a deal, then we expect a very sharp reversal in the pound.\n\n'Although this outcome for now is looking less likely, things can of course change very quickly.\n\n'For those brave enough to hold out, the payoff could be significant.\n\n'A sensible approach would be to buy at least half of your currency now, as the Brexit endgame will lead to a big swing up or down depending on the outcome.'", "description": "With political rows and the on-off threat of a no-deal Brexit, there's no guarantee what could happen to the pound between now and  31 October - or after that date.", "authors": ["Angelique Ruzicka For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
