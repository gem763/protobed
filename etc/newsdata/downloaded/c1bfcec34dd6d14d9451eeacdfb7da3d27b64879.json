He defined Kurds as Turkey\u2019s \u201cnatural enemy,\u201d adding, \u201cone historian said they\u2019ve been fighting for hundreds of years.\u201d\n\nI am not sure who that historian was, but as someone who has studied this particular history, I can assure you that the tension between Turks and Kurds is not centuries old. It is actually about one century old, and it\u2019s the result of a very modern force: nationalism.\n\nThe history does begin in the early 16th century, when the Ottoman Empire, founded in western Anatolia by Sunni Turks, began to expand eastward, only to conflict with the Shiite Safavid Empire in Persia. The Kurds, a tribal people, most of whom were Sunni Muslims, were caught in the middle; soon they willingly joined the Ottomans. Through the next four centuries, they lived under the same state with Turks, Arabs, Bosnians, Armenians, Greeks and Jews \u2014 because the Ottoman Empire, like the neighboring Hapsburg Empire, was a multiethnic and multireligious mosaic.\n\nThe Ottoman elite was mostly Turkish, but not Turkish nationalist. So Kurds never faced any denial of their identity. Their ancestral homeland was often called \u201cKurdistan,\u201d which even briefly became the name of an administrative region in the 19th century. In the same era, there were a few revolts by Kurdish chieftains, but only as a reaction to the centralization of the state and the new taxes and obligations it entailed.", "description": "No, President Trump, they are not \u201cnatural enemies.\u201d What they need is American leadership to help them make peace.", "authors": ["Mustafa Akyol"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/opinion/13Akyol1/13Akyol1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
