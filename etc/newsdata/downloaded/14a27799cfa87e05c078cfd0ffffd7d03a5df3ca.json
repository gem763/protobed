The couple told MailOnline last night they sold the lorry cab a year ago to a company in Ireland - but police officers investigating the tragedy raided their property today before searching the couple's beauty salon around the corner, New Hair Don't Care.

Gangland boss Sister Ping died in a Texas prison in 2014 where she was serving 35 years for building the world's most sophisticated network of people smugglers who brought up to 200,000 illegal immigrants into America alone. At her New York trial in 2005 she was described as 'evil incarnate' who had made a fortune moving generations of Chinese people around the world for \u00a320,000 since the early 1980s. This debt would either be paid back in wages from menial work in the West - or relatives back in the Chinese province of Fujian, known as the country's 'cradle of human smuggling', would be forced at gunpoint to take out a loan from Sister Ping's own sharks. Police eventually traced Sister Ping to China Town in New York and put her in the dock for people smuggling. But despite her incarceration and death her snakehead gang is still going strong - although its new leader is not yet known. Without her the gang is moving with the times and using social media apps including China\u2019s equivalent to Tinder, MoMo, as well as popular messaging app WeChat, promising '100 per cent safe travel'. The south-eastern province of Fujian in China has a long histories of sending migrants abroad for cash Traffickers are using social media apps including China\u2019s equivalent to Tinder, MoMo (pictured), as well as popular messaging app WeChat Adverts with attractive slogans such as \u2018speedy passage of border checks! Pay upon arrival!\u2019 are circulating on apps. People dreaming of a new life away from China pay an online deposit as low as 5,000 yuan (\u00a3550) before being crammed into boats or containers for a long, dark and risky journey, local media reported. Chinese, particularly those with lower education levels, continue to be drawn to Europe and North America by the promise of much higher wages than they can earn at home, despite the considerable risks involved. The victims would flee home hoping for a better life in the UK - but their journey to Britain would be miserable and dangerous, spending up to a month in the back of lorries in dangerous and squalid conditions. Most would be flown from China to Serbia and then transported by road through Hungary, Austria, France before a boat to Britain from Belgium or Holland. Mike Gradwell, a former Lancashire Police detective superintendent who worked on the probe into the Morecambe Bay cockling tragedy in which 23 Chinese illegal immigrants drowned, told BBC Breakfast that those in the trailer were most likely trafficked by Snakehead gangs. He said: 'These are criminal travel agents really - you go to a Snakehead to say you want to be trafficked to an economic opportunity and usually you'll borrow quite a significant amount of money.' He said relatives were likely to have been in contact with those being trafficked, who may have been carrying phones which could be used by police to help identify them. Lisa Yam, a lawyer specialising in Chinese immigration, told the programme: 'We find it is quite difficult to believe why we still have so many Chinese that choose to come into the country (like this).'\n\n'The migrant minibuses wait there all night': How quiet Essex port at centre of death truck tragedy 'comes alive at night' as ruthless traffickers exchange human cargo under cover of darkness\n\nPeople-smuggling operations are so rife at the port where 39 Chinese people were found dead this week that there is said to be a 'migrant minibus service'.\n\nFormer port security guard Gary Lilley, 61, has described how Purfleet on the River Thames in Essex 'comes alive at night' with the arrival of trafficked migrants.\n\nMr Lilley, who lives opposite the port where he worked for six weeks in 2012, also claimed minibuses meet lorries to take away the migrants following their arrival.\n\nLorries are pictured outside the Purfleet Thames Terminal in Essex on Wednesday\n\nAn aerial view of Purfleet Port (file image) where 39 Chinese people were found dead this week\n\nHe told The Times that there is a 'notorious' lay-by near the port where migrants ditch their documents so UK authorities don't know where to repatriate them to.\n\nHe added: 'Minibuses wait there at night for them to arrive. Last summer during the heatwave I gave water bottles to two five-year-old girls as they looked desperate.\n\n'They were standing by the side of the road in a group of about 15. At the lay-by you see the lorries pull up and the migrants pop their heads out to see if it's safe.\n\n'On many occasions I've seen minibuses pull up and they jump in and are driven off. It's so organised.'\n\nPurfleet in Essex is said to 'come alive at night' with the arrival of trafficked migrants\n\nMinibuses are said to meet lorries to take away the migrants following their arrival at Purfleet\n\nPolice drive the lorry along a road from the scene at Waterglade Industrial Park on Wednesday\n\nSmugglers put on 'mini bus service' to deal with demand in Purfleet Last night it was revealed that the Thames port where the migrants were found 'comes alive at night' with new arrivals. A former security guard told The Times that smuggling is so well organised in the area that mini buses meet the migrants and take them away. Gary Lilley worked at the port for around six weeks as a security guard seven years ago. He said: 'The port comes alive at around 2am. I've seen groups of migrants walking out the front door of the port with carrier bags. 'When there's a group of them a few security guards on minimum wage aren't going to stop them. They are all ages, babes in arms and five-year-old girls. 'Minibuses wait there at night for them to arrive. Last summer during the heatwave I gave water bottles to two five-year-old girls as they looked desperate.'\n\nMr Lilley said security is 'lax' at the port, with an X-ray scanner on a customs and excise lorry arriving once every two months for a day to scan vehicles arriving.\n\nThe local resident, who has lived in the area for 30 years, said the deaths were 'heartbreaking' and left him upset - but he was not surprised by what happened.\n\nIt follows the National Crime Agency warning in 2016 that people-smugglers were switching to Purfleet because it was 'less busy' than other UK entry points.\n\nThe incident on Wednesday has raised questions about border checks and whether the authorities have done enough to tackle trafficking gangs.\n\nThis May the NCA warned that Belgian ports such as Zeebrugge \u2013 from where the contained travelled to Purfleet - were becoming people-smuggling hotspots.\n\nAn earlier report from the Border Force also said Zeebrugge was a key concern.\n\nAsked about security at Purfleet, a Home Office spokesman said this week: 'I cannot comment on the specific deployment of Border Force staff and security technology.'\n\nLast night, police began moving the bodies found in the refrigerated trailer attached to a lorry as a 25-year-old man remains in custody on suspicion of murder.", "description": "The family of Pham Thi Tra My from Vietnam have appealed for help after the 26-year-old sent her mother a message telling her she was 'dying because I can't breathe.'", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/14/20180852-0-image-a-15_1572009696171.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
