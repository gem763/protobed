She is attending several events in the city next month, including the U.N. General Assembly, U.N. Youth Summit on Climate and the Climate Action Summit.\n\nShe stepped foot on land just after 4 p.m. and the 16-year-old then addressed reporters. She said \"everyone always asks about Donald Trump \u2014 'Listen to the science' and he obviously does not do that. If no one has been able to convince him about the climate crisis and the urgency, why would I be able to?\"\n\nThunberg, looking slightly embarrassed, said \"all of this is very overwhelming\" of the crowd who welcomed her to Manhattan. Though she encountered some rough seas, she said her trip across the Atlantic wasn't as uncomfortable as she expected, according to The Associated Press. Thunberg mentioned that she didn't get seasick once, but said \"this is not something I want everyone to do.\n\n\"It is insane that a 16-year-old would have to cross the Atlantic Ocean to make a stand,\" she said. \"The climate and ecological crisis is a global crisis, the biggest crisis that humanity has ever faced, and if we don't manage to work together and to cooperate and to work together despite our differences, then we will fail.\"\n\nSwedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, 16, speaks to the press on August 28, 2019, in New York.

She tweeted that her vessel, named Malizia II, was anchored off Coney Island on Wednesday morning and that they were \"clearing immigration and customs.\"\n\nAs Thunberg arrived in New York, she took time to tweet some images:\n\nThe United Nations welcomed Thunberg with a flotilla of 17 sailboats \u2014 each branded with an icon from its Sustainable Development Goals:\n\nThe @UN has sent out one boat for each of the 17 sustainable development goal to greet us! Thank you! pic.twitter.com/AU5ZSVj5vD \u2014 Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) August 28, 2019\n\nThunberg's yacht had no kitchen, no heating, no fridge and no bathroom. The vessel generated electricity through solar panels and wind turbines. Thunberg documented parts of her journey on Twitter, where she included videos of the high seas, photos of herself and the crew, and short commentaries about climate change.\n\nOn Day Four, she described conditions on Malizia II \"like camping on a roller coaster.\" Some of her videos even demonstrated the difficult conditions her crew experienced while on the journey.\n\nDay 12. We are getting closer to the North American mainland. Rough conditions, but downwind sailing. pic.twitter.com/n9huwHUSGI \u2014 Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) August 25, 2019\n\nThunberg recently celebrated the one-year anniversary of the start of her climate change movement. Last August, she began striking alone outside the Swedish parliament, and soon, students around the world began walking out of school, demanding action from their governments. She's been called \"the voice of the planet,\" and has even been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nWhile she's here in the U.S., Greta will participate in two global climate strikes in addition to attending the U.N.'s Youth Summit on Climate on September 21 and Climate Action Summit on September 23. It's unclear how she plans to eventually travel back home.\n\nThe Malizia II, a zero-carbon yacht, on August 28, 2019, in New York.
