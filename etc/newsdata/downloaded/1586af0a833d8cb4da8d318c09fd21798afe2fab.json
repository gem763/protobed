That's because co-working spaces tend to sign long-term leases with the landlord, and then re-lease the spaces to smaller, less-established companies that would be \"particularly susceptible to an economic downturn.\"\n\n\"Thus, in a downturn the co-working company would be exposed to the loss of tenant income, which puts both them and the property owner at risk if they cannot make lease payments to the owner of the building,\" he said.\n\nRead More", "description": "The growing popularity of co-working spaces like WeWork could pose a risk to the US economy in the next economic downturn, a Fed official warned on Friday.", "authors": ["Victoria Cavaliere", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190920130201-coworking-wework-boston-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
