They found the driver\u2019s wife in his van, dead for weeks, police say.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nCasei Jones of Summerfield, Fla., was found dead in her husband's van, where police say her body had been for weeks. Michael Wayne Jones, 38, is charged with second-degree murder in her death. The 32-year-old, along with her four children, had not been seen for six weeks when they were reported missing. The couple's four children were later found dead, as well. (Marion County, Fla., Sheriff's Office)\n\nPolice responding to a single-vehicle crash in Brantley County, Ga., on Sunday made the grisly discovery that the 38-year-old driver was hiding his wife\u2019s body in the back of the van, just one day after relatives reported her and her four children missing in Florida. Detectives say 32-year-old Casei Jones of Summerfield, Fla., had been dead for several weeks.\n\n\u201cGo ahead and arrest me, my wife\u2019s body is in the back,\u201d Michael Wayne Jones told the Georgia police officers at the crash scene, according to Sgt. Paul Bloom of the Marion County, Fla., Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\n[How Google Earth helped solve the mystery of a decades-old disappearance]\n\nAfter the crash, Jones led Georgia police to a nearby wooded area, where they found four more bodies. Police have yet to identify them officially, but based on crime scene evidence and interviews, they say they\u2019re certain that the bodies are those of Casei Jones\u2019s young children, two of whom she had with Jones: Cameron Bowers, 10; Preston Bowers, 5; Mercalli Jones, 2; and Aiyana Jones, 1.\n\nJones was arrested and charged with second-degree murder in his wife\u2019s killing.\n\n\n\nMichael Wayne Jones of Summerfield, Fla., is charged with second-degree murder in the death of his wife, Casei Jones. (Marion County, Fla., Sheriff's Office)\n\nPolice say they think Jones killed his family about 170 miles away, in their Summerfield home. That\u2019s where investigators said Jones probably kept their bodies for about three weeks before he put them in his van, where they remained for several weeks more.\n\nAt a Monday news conference, Marion County, Fla., Sheriff Billy Woods grew emotional at times and called the news both heartbreaking and infuriating.\n\n\u201cAll we need to know is that\u2019s evil. And evil did something. And evil needs to pay for what he did,\u201d Woods said in reference to Jones.\n\n[He\u2019s suspected in four women\u2019s deaths \u2014 and \u2018would have killed again,\u2019 sheriff says]\n\nThe discovery of the bodies is a grim conclusion to the weeks of worry by Jones\u2019s family. According to a spokeswoman for the Marion County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Casei Jones\u2019s mother, Nikki Jones, told police she had not seen or heard from her daughter or her grandchildren in about six weeks and was concerned that Michael Jones had done something to his family.\n\n\u201cThe red flag, which for anybody that knew Casei, was when she didn\u2019t post anything [to Facebook] for her son\u2019s birthday,\u201d Sarah Gilbert, Jones\u2019s sister, told ABC 9 in Florida.\n\nRelatives reported Casei and the children missing Saturday, prompting Marion County sheriff\u2019s deputies to visit the family\u2019s home in Summerfield. There, the well-being check turned into a crime scene discovery: Police observed the home looked as if it had been vacant for \u201cseveral weeks,\u201d and once the landlord let them inside, they described smelling the \u201codor of decomposition.\u201d\n\nThe search warrant for the home was being executed in Florida around the same time Jones was caught.\n\nThough the bodies of Casei Jones and her children have been found, Bloom said more questions remain; he notes Michael Jones had no previous record, and there had been no prior calls to the family home.\n\nThe slayings, meanwhile, have shocked the town.\n\n\u201cEveryone in the community is trying to make sense of something that\u2019s senseless,\u201d Bloom said. He noted that one of the lead detectives in the sheriff\u2019s department celebrates his 31st year on the job this week. That detective \u201csaid this is the worst he\u2019s seen.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA man said his SUV randomly caught fire and killed his family.
