Below you\u2019ll find easily digestible nuggets addressing some of the critical situations fantasy owners will face from week to week.\n\nDig in. And dominate.\n\nAD\n\nBye weeks: Cowboys, Ravens.\n\nSleepers\n\nPhillip Dorsett II, WR, Patriots: Dorsett has been doing just enough to remain on fantasy rosters, but he\u2019s not making most starting lineups. New England hosts Cleveland in Week 8, and while the Browns\u2019 secondary has been solid, it still is a decent enough matchup that Dorsett could be useful, especially now that Josh Gordon is on injured reserve. The Patriots\u2019 trade for Mohamed Sanu tamps down the ceiling for Dorsett over the long term, but for those in need of a spot start, Dorsett could come through this weekend. He\u2019s owned in 32 percent of ESPN leagues.\n\nAD\n\nDeVante Parker, WR, Dolphins: In his fifth year in Miami, Parker has been little more than an afterthought in fantasy football. Even now, coming off his best game of the season against a stout Buffalo defense, Parker has very few buying in on the idea he can be fantasy relevant. He\u2019s owned in less than 9 percent of ESPN leagues. Parker finished with a season-high 10 targets in Week 7, hauling in five receptions for 55 yards and a touchdown, his third consecutive game with a score. While the odds are against Parker scoring for a fourth straight week, he\u2019ll certainly have the opportunity to provide a productive outing against the Steelers. Still, it\u2019s tough to label Parker a WR2. At best, the Dolphins\u2019 wideout is a flex option.\n\nAD\n\nFringe starters\n\nJohn Brown, WR, Bills: Brown\u2019s average draft position was 139, but here he is with no fewer than 51 yards in any game this season and he\u2019s had at least five targets each week. He\u2019s starting to be inserted into more fantasy lineups and has a great four-week schedule beginning in Week 8, with games against the Eagles, Redskins, Browns and Dolphins. If he hasn\u2019t worked his way into the WR2 conversation, he\u2019s at least a flex consideration this week against a Philadelphia secondary that has been extremely vulnerable.\n\nAD\n\nTy Johnson, RB, Lions: Because Johnson\u2019s ownership has skyrocketed from virtually zero to 51 percent in ESPN leagues, we won\u2019t include him in the \u201csleepers\u201d group. With teammate Kerryon Johnson suffering a knee injury and landing on the injured reserve list, Ty Johnson will get his shot in Week 8 in a very appealing matchup against the Giants. He likely will be sharing touches with J.D. McKissic, but it\u2019s too good a matchup to pass up for owners considering Johnson.\n\nAD\n\nJuJu Smith-Schuster, WR, Steelers: There were a lot of pundits hyping the Pittsburgh wideout heading into the season, but count me among those who had doubts. One can\u2019t be too hard on Smith-Schuster given the Steelers have had their top two quarterbacks miss time due to injury, but his fantasy owners would love more production. In standard scoring leagues, Smith-Schuster has reached double digits just twice. While it\u2019s never ideal to be playing with a backup QB, with the Steelers coming off a bye and hosting the Dolphins, this doesn\u2019t seem like the week to have reservations about Smith-Schuster.\n\nInjury decisions\n\nAD\n\nDavante Adams, WR, Packers: ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter tweeted that Green Bay would list Adams as doubtful for Week 8. The added issue for Adams owners is the Packers play Sunday night so it\u2019s time to look elsewhere for receiving help.\n\nAD\n\nKeenan Allen, WR, Chargers: Allen is dealing with a hamstring injury and is likely to have his snaps limited in San Diego\u2019s matchup against the Bears. That bodes well for Hunter Henry and Austin Ekeler owners if Allen is limited to being mostly a decoy.\n\nDrew Brees, QB, Saints: New Orleans Coach Sean Payton has yet to name a starter for the team\u2019s Week 8 matchup. With the Saints on a bye in Week 9, the hunch is Brees sits out and returns in Week 10.\n\nA.J. Green, WR, Bengals: It doesn\u2019t look like Green will make his season debut as he remains sidelined with an ankle injury.\n\nAD\n\nDeSean Jackson, WR, Eagles: Jackson has been ruled out for Week 8.\n\nJosh Jacobs, RB, Raiders: Jacobs is battling a shoulder injury but is expected to play Sunday against the Texans.\n\nAD\n\nDavid Johnson, RB, Cardinals: Week 7 was a blow to Johnson owners after he was declared active, only to exit the game early as he continues to deal with a back injury. Johnson did not practice Wednesday, and will be a game-time decision, but his owners probably want to find an alternative. Arizona signed Alfred Morris this week, which doesn\u2019t bode well for Johnson owners this upcoming weekend. It\u2019s time to grab Chase Edmonds if he\u2019s still available. He\u2019s owned in 56 percent of ESPN leagues.\n\nChristian Kirk, WR, Cardinals: Arizona has been without Kirk for several weeks as the wideout works his way back from an ankle injury. He\u2019s a game-time decision, but best advice is to leave him on the bench until you see him on the field for an entire game.\n\nAD\n\nPatrick Mahomes, QB, Chiefs: No one expects Mahomes to suit up after he suffered a knee injury last Thursday against the Broncos.\n\nAD\n\nMatt Ryan, QB, Falcons: With a 1-6 record, Ryan is integral to any hopes Atlanta has of turning around its season. An ankle injury suffered in Week 7 threatens to sideline the fantasy stalwart. Before getting hurt against the Rams, Ryan was rolling, with six straight 300-yard games and 15 TDs. There\u2019s little information to go on as the Falcons prepare for a Week 8 matchup against the visiting Seahawks. Ryan was on the practice field Friday, but it remains a question mark if he will be lead the Falcons in Week 8. His owners will need to monitor on Sunday.\n\nSterling Shepard, WR, Giants: Shepard has yet to be fully cleared after suffering a concussion. He\u2019s had two this season and his availability for the remainder of the fantasy season is in doubt.\n\nAD\n\nSammy Watkins, WR, Chiefs: Kansas City will have the speedy wideout back in Week 8. Watkins returns from a hamstring injury, but with Mahomes likely out, it might be best to keep him on the bench.\n\nAD\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nAD", "description": "A guide to managing your fantasy football lineup, with updates on A.J.
