Taking to Instagram on Tuesday, the 31-year-old former Bachelor star spoke candidly about her struggles\n\n'I've come to recognise many of these strivings in myself have formed as a distraction from my own issues and mental health illness, rather than something just \"fun\" that I occasionally give time to,' she confessed.\n\nMegan said she came to this realisation after a recent fun night out with friends ended with her having an emotional meltdown.\n\n'On Sunday night after a good day and night with friends, drinking and dancing, I found myself on Manly beach laying on the sand by myself, in tears, for a good hour or so, wondering what the f*** I was doing and why I feel so lost,' she confessed.\n\nPitfalls of fame: In a lengthy post, Megan confessed her 'make-shift fame' and 'social notoriety' - among other things - are simply 'part of ego fulfillment'\n\nShe said that while there wasn't one thing that triggered her meltdown, she simply put it down to a variety of causes.\n\n'An over-active mind, change of prescription anti-depressant dose, the fact that I haven't had sex in a very long time (haha), and the realisation that I haven't achieved everything I wanted to by the age of thirty-one (in relationships and career),' she listed.\n\nAfter describing her emotional episode as a 'rom-com \"meltdown\"', Megan acknowledged that 'life isn't a rom-com'.\n\nFeeling down: She said that while there wasn't one thing that triggered her meltdown, she simply put it down to a variety of causes\n\n'A romance can't save you from yourself, nor can running away as I always seem to do, nor can wearing and showing a thin, plastic mask to the world, that will only melt and decay as time lengthens,' she continued.\n\nShe added: 'We have to come back to what humanness should be about.'\n\nBut she said she had found ways to cope, claiming 'making time every day, for nature, meditation, exercise, working and reading' all helped.\n\n'On Sunday night after a good day and night with friends, drinking and dancing, I found myself on Manly beach laying on the sand by myself, in tears,' she confessed. Pictured alongside best friend Elora Murger\n\n'I don't have the answers to everlasting mental health change, but I do know that no matter where you come from or what you do, we all struggle,' she said.\n\n'In our singular feelings of solitude, there is also communal solidarity...\n\n'I see you, and you see me, in the darkness and pain there is hope and that is so goddamn beautiful.'", "description": "Megan Marx has opened up about her battle with mental health.
