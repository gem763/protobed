Bloom, in his lyric sadness, his grandiloquent fatigue, and his messianic loneliness, is a great soul. \"He did not seem happy,\" a former student says. \"But happiness seemed a trivial quality compared to whatever Harold was.\" Bloom is not low so much as over the top. In his misery, he is magnificent... In his view, Western literature reached its apogee in Shakespeare, and it has been downhill ever since. Bloom loves Emerson and Whitman but he doesn\u2019t believe them: to him, belatedness is now a permanent condition of man, and there can be no overcoming it-no return, even in America, to an original fullness or freshness or purity of spirit... In fact, it\u2019s not just historicizing that Bloom rejects-it\u2019s pastness per se. He reads poems as though reliving their creation. Bloom likes his poems bloody, trailing ruptured veins and muscles torn in struggle... Bloom is a literary critic at Yale and New York University, an authority on the Romantic poets and on Yeats and Wallace Stevens. He is the author of \"The Anxiety of Influence\" and, more recently, of best-selling books such as \"The Western Canon,\" \"The Book of J,\" and \"How to Read and Why.\" Next month, he publishes his twenty-eighth book, eight hundred pages long, titled \"Genius: A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Minds.\" Despite these critical credentials, however, Bloom is not, for the most part, a close reader... When Bloom teaches, he uncoils and grows even larger. He seems to his students not quite in control of himself: he gets carried away, he throws himself around, he slips his hand inside his shirt and grasps his chest, he quivers with feeling... Writer compares him to Falstaff... Many of Bloom\u2019s students love him; others grow up to become feminists and Marxists and New Historicists, and reject everything he taught them. Bloom is Falstaff; but Falstaff was betrayed by only one Hal. Bloom is betrayed by thousands... Every year, Bloom is invited to Europe, to receive a prize, or to give a lecture, or for some other reason. Every year, he accepts, and then, every year at the end of the journey, he vows never to travel again... Describes the circumstances of a speech he gives in Spain on the subject of Borges and the decline of criticism... Tells about a 1965 depression which produced a work of what he considered prose rhapsody, and, in the years it took to produce the book, of his conversion to Gnosticism... In 1973, Bloom finally, painfully, finished the book that had begun with his nightmare. The book, \"The Anxiety of Influence,\" was dense and complicated; it employed so many obscure terms that it seemed to have been written by a kabbalistic Lewis Carroll. Bloom is indeed alienated from his entire profession. He has given up teaching graduate students because, he says, he fears that they will be tarred by his brush. (The value of his support has also been somewhat downgraded by his habit of scrawling genially, on recommendations, \"Best student I ever had.\")... Bloom, like his predecessors, has become rich and famous. He loves this, of course. But there was a blithe, paterfamilias confidence about the earlier entrepreneurs that Bloom\u2019s work is missing. To read Bloom with Erskine and Adler in mind is to realize that the forties were a long, long time ago. The Erskines and the Adlers believed that they were bestowing moral and cultural goods on the masses; Bloom describes himself as seeking refuge in the common reader-the last man, he feels, who still might read for pleasure... Describes an evening cognac by Bloom and his retiring to sleep...\n\nView Article", "description": "PROFILE of critic and writer Harold Bloom, 72...
