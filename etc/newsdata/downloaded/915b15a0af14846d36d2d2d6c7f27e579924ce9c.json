More than 60 years later, the tallboy has finally earned its place in the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a source that has been teaching people about the English language since 1847.\n\n\u201cTallboy\u201d was one of more than 530 new words and definitions added to the Merriam-Webster website, the online resource that\u2019s accessed tens of millions of times each month.\n\n\u201cA long time coming, right?\u201d says Emily Brewster, the all-too-appropriately named senior editor for Merriam-Webster.\n\n[Tofurky takes Arkansas to court over the word \u2018meat\u2019]\n\nThe delayed recognition for \u201ctallboy\u201d among lexicographers is not unusual, Brewster says. The dictionary does not attempt to be a leading predictor of language, she adds, but more a reflection of words that have become \u201cestablished members of the language.\u201d Each word must satisfy a few basic criteria before it can be considered for inclusion in Merriam-Webster: There must be \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of the word in current use, with a generally set definition, and the word must be found in a variety of publications over an extended period of time, Brewster says.\n\nThe criteria, she emphasizes, are \u201cas intentionally vague as they sound.\u201d\n\nSo while the term \u201ctallboy\u201d has been part of the brewing and bar industries for decades, it has only recently started to appear in mainstream publications on a consistent basis, probably because craft breweries have embraced oversize cans as a way to compete with the global breweries that hog all the shelves in 7-Eleven coolers. (These days, the term \u201ctallboy\u201d can be applied to even bigger-format containers, including 19.2-ounce cans that hold roughly the same amount of suds as an imperial pint.)\n\nAbout 20 staffers at Merriam-Webster are devoted to seeking out new or revised dictionary entries. Any one of those employees can propose a new word or phrase, such as \u201cdeep state\u201d (\u201can alleged secret network of especially nonelected government officials and sometimes private entities \u2026 operating extralegally to influence and enact government policy\u201d), or expand the definition of a current entry, such as \u201cinclusive\u201d (\u201callowing and accommodating people who have historically been excluded\u201d). Their proposals will then be reviewed by other editors, who assess the merits of the words or definitions.\n\nStephen Perrault, director of defining at Merriam-Webster, makes the final call, Brewster says. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty long and involved process,\u201d she adds. (Brewster, incidentally, can take credit for both \u201cdeep state\u201d and \u201cinclusive,\u201d though editors tend to refrain from such self-aggrandizement.)\n\nThat long and involved process has added a number of other food and drink terms to the dictionary. They include \u201cmatcha\u201d (\u201cgreen powder made from ground green tea leaves that is used to make tea and other beverages\u201d), \u201cHalloumi\u201d (\u201ca white, brine-cured Cypriot cheese made usually from a mixture of sheep\u2019s and goat\u2019s milk\u201d) and \u201cchana\u201d (the Hindi word for \u201cchickpea\u201d). These newbies are in addition to other recent entries \u2014 \u201cbhut jolokia\u201d (otherwise known as the \u201cghost pepper\u201d), \u201cdulce de leche\u201d (\u201csweetened caramelized milk\u201d), mofongo (\u201ca Puerto Rican dish consisting of fried green plantains mashed with garlic, salt, and olive oil\u201d) \u2014 that continue to expand the vocabulary around food in the United States.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a golden age\u201d of food and drink, Brewster says. \u201cPeople are really expanding their food interests into unfamiliar territories.\u201d\n\nAnd the dictionary, she says, is merely reflecting those ever-widening interests.\n\nRead more on Voraciously:\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is tardy to the chicken-sandwich party with a spicy entry that can\u2019t touch Popeyes\u2019\n\nCalling all barbecue hounds: How much would you pay for an Aaron Franklin backyard smoker?\n\nNow Popeyes is trolling America by inviting people to make their own chicken sandwiches", "description": "The dictionary's new entries reflect America's ever-expanding culinary landscape or, more simply, craft beer's embrace of oversize cans.", "authors": ["Tim Carman", "Reporter Focusing On National Food Issues", "Critic Covering Affordable", "Under-The-Radar Restaurants In The D.C.
