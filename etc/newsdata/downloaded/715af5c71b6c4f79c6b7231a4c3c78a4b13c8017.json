While Israel has set up a field hospital for injured Syrians and even given some rebels aid and safe passage out of the country, it has strenuously rejected any connection to the terrorists of the Islamic State group. (Times of Israel)\n\nRouhani went on to denounce America as being a \"supporter of terrorism\" in the Middle East and elsewhere.\n\n\"Wherever America has gone, terrorism has expanded in the wake,\" he said, giving U.S. involvement in Syria without President Bashar al-Assad's permission as an example.\n\n\"The country that is present and flying over the air space of and bombarding the soil of the country of Syria without permission of the government is the United States of America,\" he said.\n\nRouhani said he would not consider meeting with the U.S. unless economic sanctions were lifted.\n\n\u201cWhy would we bump into one another? If we seek to pursue higher goals to benefit both countries, both people, it must be planned,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cBut prior to that, we must create mutual trust and the trust is something that Mr. Trump took away from this framework. We had an agreement and Mr. Trump exited without a valid justification and illegally from an international agreement,\u201d he said referring to the 2015 nuclear deal. \u201cTrust must be restored, and the restoration of trust consists in taking away the pressure imposed upon the nation and the people of Iran which show that clearly there is animosity even towards our children, our ill people, because we \u2014 they even have difficulty in obtaining basic medications and medical equipment.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThis is a type of terrorism. This is inhumane, and if there is a cessation to this, then, of course, the atmosphere will change. Of course, then it can be envisioned, and we can talk about many different topics of mutual interest for both sides.\u201d", "description": ".09/25/2019 9:36:59AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Guy Benson", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/270/9ddf9dc5-5dd7-4e03-ac95-d0c961b66a7f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
