The smell of the meat and fish he's been cooking has apparently prevented her from enjoying her own backyard.\n\nCilla Carden, of Perth, has been in a court battle with neighbor Toan Vu and his family since last year.\n\nEven Basketballs Are Too Much For Her\n\nShe's also complained about Vu's kids playing basketball in the backyard -- y'know, just living their lives.\n\nCarden's court battle has so far led to nothing. Ladbible writes that her claims have been rejected by the Supreme Court of Western Australia, though her lawyer, John Hammond, says she could still take it to the country's Supreme Court.\n\nWoman Says She Can't Go Outside\n\nCarden has spoken to Australian news media, saying: \"They've put it there so I smell fish, all I can smell is fish... I can't go out there.\"\n\n\"It's been devastating, it's been turmoil, it's been unrest, I haven't been able to sleep,\" she says.\n\nThanks For Ruining Everyone's Fun\n\nVu says he just wants to \"keep the peace,\" and adds that he's moved the barbecue away from the backyard. Where it is now we can only guess.\n\nLadbible adds that Vu has told his kids to stop playing basketball, so that's nice.", "description": "A little extreme!", "authors": ["Emily Reily"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OxhMJcPCDjmI5PGSqRIW5w--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/theblast_73/f55211338bf123b9ee6f1b9b05f20332"}
