Find out what the most common reasons are for this year\n\nAs of 2014, a total of 363,280 UK driving licences have been medically revoked, new research has revealed.\n\nFigures released by the Driver and Vehicle Licencing Agency show there's been a significant rise in the number of motorists being taken off the road because of illnesses and condition since 2016.\n\nThese peaked in 2018, with 73,724 cases of motorists being deemed unfit for the road last year, according to online car sales site, Motorway.co.uk.\n\nAnd already in 2019 - up until the end of July - a total of 42,467 licences have been medically rescinded, based on the government agency's records.\n\nThe result of a freedom of information request to the DVLA found that 86 per cent were car and motorcycle licences (Group 1) and 14 per cent were qualified lorry and bus drivers with Group 2 licences.\n\nNumber of licences medically revoked each year 2014: 48,941 2015: 55,753 2016: 72,019 2017: 70,376 2018: 73,724 2019 (to end of July): 42,467 Source: DVLA stats provided to Motorway.co.uk\n\nOf those who lost licences, almost two-thirds (65 per cent) were over the age of 50.\n\nWhile that might not be all that surprising, given that many of the most common conditions impact older people, there were also plenty of cases of young motorists being rendered unfit to be behind the wheel.\n\nSome 829 licences revoked so far in 2019 were taken from teenagers, the figures show.\n\nUsing the breakdown of figures for this year only, alcoholism is the single main reason why the DVLA had been forced to cancel driving licences.\n\nAlready this year there have been 5,450 licences voided because of alcohol dependency issues, the DLVA says.\n\nA variety conditions that cause seizures or blackouts have also led to a combined 7,159 licences being taken away.\n\nSurprisingly, poor eyesight is only the third most common condition that has resulted in a licence being revoked this year, with 4,534 cases.\n\nThis figure could soon rise, though, following the news that drivers over the age of 70 might be required to have their eyes tested every three years if they want to keep their licence.\n\nSome 2,865 drivers have had their licences revoked in the past 18 months for sleep related conditions, including narcolepsy, the figures showed\n\nMost common conditions resulting in revoked licences (2019) 1. Alcohol - 5,450 cases (15% of all medically rescinded licences) 2. Seizures - 5,417 cases (14.9%) 3. Eyesight - 4,534 cases (12.5%) 4. Memory problems - 4,175 (11.5%) 5. Mental health - 3,268 cases (9.0%) 6. Neurological - 3,041 cases (8.4%) 7. Cardiac - 2,228 cases (6.1%) 8. Drugs - 1,770 cases (4.9%) 9. Blackouts - 1,742 cases (4.8%) 10. Diabetes - 1,176 cases (3.2%) Source: DVLA stats provided to Motorway.co.uk\n\nIf a driver has their licence revoked on medical grounds, in many cases they can reapply for their licence once their doctor says they meet the medical standards for driving - though some conditions have a mandatory time required since the last seizure, episode or flare-up, such as epilepsy.\n\nHowever, the rules are different if a driver voluntarily surrenders their licence.\n\nUnder these circumstances, you can drive while your licence is being renewed if; you have the support of your doctor, a valid licence, you only drive under the conditions of the previous licence, you're not disqualified, or your last licence wasn't revoked and your application is less than 12 months old.\n\n'Tip of the iceberg': Alex Buttle says there may be many more drivers on the road with serious conditions they haven't declared to the DVLA\n\nAlex Buttle, director of car selling comparison website Motorway.co.uk said the figures could be just the 'tip of the iceberg', as there could be many more people driving with medical conditions that impair their ability at the wheel that haven't been communicated with the relevant authorities.\n\nButtle said: 'You can be fined up to \u00a31,000 if you don't tell the DVLA about a medical condition that affects your driving, but is that really a strong enough deterrent?'\n\n'With so many of us reliant on our cars for work and pleasure, there will be drivers on the road who think it's worth the risk to keep quiet because handing in their driving licence could mean losing their mobility, their job and not seeing their family and friends.'\n\nAccording to Gov.uk, license holders 'need to tell DVLA about some medical conditions as they can affect your driving', with almost 200 separate issues listed on the government's website.
