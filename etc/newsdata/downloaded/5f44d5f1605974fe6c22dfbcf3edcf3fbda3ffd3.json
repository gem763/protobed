REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan\n\nBut the firefighters in the once verdant district of Pulang Pisau often have only makeshift equipment, with little more than face masks to protect against choking smoke from the blazes.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to provide fireproof suits for the volunteers, so they wear what they own, but the important thing is to ensure their safety,\u201d said Mulyadi, a military officer overseeing the effort.\n\n(Click reut.rs/2mrnvad for a picture package on the firefighters tackling Borneo's blazes)\n\nThe volunteers, often clad in sandals or trainers, line up in military fashion alongside others from the army, police, the disaster mitigation agency and non-government bodies, such as Greenpeace, for a briefing on the day\u2019s tasks.\n\nThe fires have sent a choking smog across Borneo and Indonesia\u2019s island of Sumatra, as well as the neighboring nations of Malaysia and Singapore, carried by shifting winds.\n\nThis year\u2019s hot spots are the most numerous since devastating blazes in 2015, as an El Nino weather pattern exacerbates the annual dry spell.\n\nIndonesia has sent more than 29,000 military, police and disaster agency personnel, along with 34 water-bombing helicopters, to fight the fires, its disaster agency has said.\n\nYudi Oktama, 21, said he had spent about two months as a volunteer, popularly referred to by the abbreviation \u201csatgas\u201d, for \u201csatuan tugas\u201d, or task force in Indonesian, and received a stipend of 100,000 rupiah ($7) a day.\n\nSaleh Hendra, 41, another volunteer, said the hardest part of the job was trying to tackle stubborn fires on peatland, which is especially flammable and can repeatedly reignite.\n\n\u201cThere is more sorrow than happiness (in this work),\u201d he said, describing long days in the field that often force the volunteers to skip Muslim Friday prayers.\n\nAsked if he was afraid, he responded, \u201cWhat else can we do? The fear is there but we\u2019re concerned because of our families.\u201d\n\nThe role of volunteers includes educating residents on ways to avoid slash-and-burn clearance of new land for plantations, a practice often blamed for the fires.The district in Indonesia\u2019s province of Central Kalimantan on Borneo is home to 126,000 people, and about a fifth of its 95 villages are vulnerable to forest fires in the dry season.\n\nIt is often a struggle to find water to pour on the flames, as more than half the area\u2019s 9,000 wells were dry, said Mulyadi, who uses only one name.\n\nSome residents use buckets of water to douse flames threatening their homes, often marooned in scorched areas of gnarled and charred tree trunks.\n\nAs night falls, firefighters don headlamps, flashlights, or fall back on just the torch on their handphones to illuminate their path.\n\nIn the provincial capital of Palangkaraya, the air pollution index has hovered above 500 for days, a level that environment officials classify as dangerous.\n\nSlideshow (34 Images)\n\n\u201cThe air quality is similar to inhaling 50 cigarettes at the same time,\u201d said Sumarni Laman, a volunteer at the city\u2019s Ranu Welum Foundation, who works to preserve the culture of the region\u2019s Dayak people and protect forests.\n\nShopkeeper Risa Astrinova said she worried about the health of her six-year-old, who suffers from asthma.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid for my son, he has just been discharged from the hospital last year,\u201d added Astrinova, 31, who was forced to close her small shop for a week because of the smoke.", "description": "From soon after sunrise, a group of volunteers gathers every day on Indonesia's portion of Borneo island to throw themselves into the desperate fight against the worst forest fires in years.", "authors": ["Willy Kurniawan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431903875&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0IE", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
