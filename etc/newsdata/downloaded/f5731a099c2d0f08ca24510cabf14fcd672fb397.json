Measles was deemed eliminated in the U.S. in 2000.\n\nThe New York State Department of Health announced Thursday that more than 42 days \u2014 or two incubation periods \u2014 have passed without any new cases of measles in Sullivan and Orange counties.\n\nRockland County, New York, which has had 312 measles cases since last year, declared its outbreak over last Wednesday.\n\nMore than 900 people have been infected with measles in the state of New York this year. The outbreak began Oct. 1, 2018.\n\n\u201cReaching this milestone, as Rockland County did last week, means there are no longer any active cases in New York State associated with the initial measles outbreak from October 2018,\u201d the New York state health department said in a statement.\n\nJohn Lyon, spokesman for Rockland County Executive Ed Day, said there was possible exposure to an imported measles case Sept. 20 and 21.\n\nBut he said the case is not related to the previous outbreak, adding that he doesn\u2019t expect measles to have the same impact on the county due to vaccination efforts.\n\nThe New York health department also is responding to a couple of measles cases in Nassau, a case in Monroe and a case in Putnam counties. The measles exposures are linked to international travel and are \u201cnot affiliated with the 2018 outbreak,\u201d according to the department.\n\nTo help stop the spread of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio Cuomo signed legislation to end nonmedical vaccine exemptions in June. A public health emergency was declared for parts of Brooklyn in April.\n\nMore than 75% of the cases this year were linked to outbreaks in New York, according to the CDC. The majority of those cases were among people who were not vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe elimination status for the U.S. was important not only for our own pride, but because of its international leadership. It motivates other countries to make similar efforts,\u201d said William Schaffner, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\nThe measles outbreaks were linked to travelers who brought measles back from other countries such as Israel, the Philippines and Ukraine, where large outbreaks are occurring.\n\n\u201cThere will continue to be importations of measles from other parts of the world,\u201d Dr. Schaffner said. \u201cWe will need to remain alert obviously to all imported cases whether in New York or any other part of the United States and assure ourselves that new chains of transmission do not get started.\u201d\n\nThe CDC set out in 1978 to eliminate measles in the U.S., and that goal was accomplished in 2000.\n\nBefore widespread use of the measles vaccine, an estimated 3 million to 4 million people caught measles each year in the U.S., leading to about 400 to 500 deaths and 48,000 hospitalizations, according to the CDC.\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious virus that can spread through coughing and sneezing. The virus can live in the air for up to two hours. In addition to a rash, measles can cause high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes.\n\nChildren under age 5 and adults older than 20 are more likely to experience complications from measles. Complications include ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia and encephalitis.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
