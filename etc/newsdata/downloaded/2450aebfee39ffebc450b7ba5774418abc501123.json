It expects a 1.1% annual increase in ad-spend over the year.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, it (the Bellwether report) believes businesses will be eager to accelerate marketing efforts once uncertainty has cleared, and subsequently sees 2020 onwards being more positive on the ad-spend front,\u201d the survey said.\n\nIt expects growth of 1.8% in 2020, followed by stronger rates of increase in the years after that.\n\nBellwether panel members, recruited from Britain\u2019s top 1,000 companies, said the underwhelming performance of marketing budgets continued into the quarter and that the net balance was broadly unchanged from the prior quarter.\n\n\u201cLow consumer confidence was said to have generated hesitancy towards spending, leading firms to hold back on big-ticket marketing drives and tighten the purse strings,\u201d the survey said.\n\nBritain is scheduled to leave the European Union on Oct. 31, but it is still uncertain whether the two sides can make a breakthrough over the terms of the departure, while the risk of a disorderly no-deal Brexit also remains.\n\nThe survey showed that development of new online tools encouraged firms to boost their internet budgets with internet marketing remaining the \u201ctop performer\u201d in the third-quarter.\n\nThe report comes as advertising companies, including market leader WPP Plc (WPP.L), are seeing clients switch to online platforms such as Google and Facebook to reach consumers.\n\nIndustry forecaster Zenith had said earlier this month ad spending on social media is expected to grow 20% in 2019, overtaking print to become the third-largest advertising channel.", "description": "British companies cut spending on marketing for the first time in seven years during the third quarter, as a rocky Brexit pushed businesses to keep a tight lid on costs, a survey showed.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441652597&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F21B", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
