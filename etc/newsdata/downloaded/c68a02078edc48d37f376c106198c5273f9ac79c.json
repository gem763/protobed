Instead, despite being told repeatedly by the prize\u2019s literary director, Gaby Wood, that they were not allowed to split the \u00a350,000 award, they chose two novels: Atwood\u2019s The Testaments, a follow-up to her dystopian The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, and Evaristo\u2019s Girl, Woman, Other, which is told in the voices of 12 different characters, mostly black women.\n\nEvaristo\u2019s win makes her the first black woman to win the Booker since it began in 1969 and the first black British author. At 79, Atwood becomes the prize\u2019s oldest winner. The Canadian author previously won the Booker in 2000 for The Blind Assassin; she becomes the fourth author to have won the prize twice.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo. Photograph: handout\n\nAtwood said after the ceremony at London\u2019s Guildhall: \u201cIt would have been quite embarrassing for a person of my age and stage to have won the whole thing and thereby hinder a person in an earlier stage of their career from going through that door. I really would have been embarrassed, trust me on that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the jury. I have been on a jury that split the prize and I understand the predicament. I get it ... they should have split it 13 ways but unfortunately that\u2019s not how it goes.\u201d\n\nEvaristo said: \u201cI\u2019m just so delighted to have won the prize. Yes, I am sharing it with an amazing writer. But I am not thinking about sharing it, I am thinking about the fact that I am here and that\u2019s an incredible thing considering what the prize has meant to me and my literary life, and the fact that it felt so unattainable for decades.\u201d\n\nAt a press conference, Evaristo was asked if she would have preferred to win the full \u00a350,000. She said: \u201cWhat do you think? Yes but I\u2019m happy to share it. That\u2019s the kind of person I am.\u201d\n\nEvaristo said she would put it towards her mortgage; Atwood said she was \u201ctoo old\u201d and had \u201ctoo many handbags\u201d to spend it on herself. She said her \u00a325,000 would be donated to the Canadian Indigenous charity Indspire, one she has previously helped with her late friend and First Nations leader Chief Harry St Denis.\n\nWhen asked about the recent death of her longtime partner, the Canadian author Graeme Gibson, Atwood responded: \u201cDo you think that is in good taste? It is the best of times and it is the worst of times. If you\u2019re really wondering what I am doing here, it is much better for me to be on the road right now, surrounded by lots of people and talking about other things.\u201d\n\nFlorence revealed the jury has been put under pressure to have one winner. \u201cOur consensus was that it was our decision to flout the rules and divide this year\u2019s prize to celebrate two winners,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are two books we started not wanting to give up and the more we talked about them the more we treasured both of them and wanted them both as winners \u2026 We couldn\u2019t separate them.\u201d\n\nThe Booker prize has been split twice before: in 1974, by Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton, and in 1992, by Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth. After 1992, the rules were changed to insist that the prize \u201cmay not be divided or withheld\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Testaments by Margaret Atwood.

They were told no. They went back into discussions for another hour, to come up with the same, unanimous choice. Wood spoke to the chair of trustees, Helena Kennedy, who also insisted on the rules being kept. The jury came back a third time, announcing with what Florence said was \u201cabsolute consensus\u201d, that they had decided to ignore the rules.\n\n\u201cWe spent a good hour and a half agonising over how to resolve the issue to the jurors\u2019 satisfaction, and the eventual decision that was taken was a moment of joy for all of us,\u201d said Florence. \u201cWe were trying to accommodate the rules that were given to us. How do you equably and fairly resolve something that seems irresolvable? You find a way of changing the game.\u201d\n\nAsked if she supported the decision, Wood said: It is an explicit flouting of the rules and they all understood that. It was a rebellious gesture but it was \u2026 a generous one.\u201d\n\nShe made clear that the rules would not be changed in future \u2013 and that this year\u2019s jury was not the first to ask to split the prize.\n\nFlorence said: \u201cI hope both winning authors will accept this as a mark of respect to two books.\u201d\n\nThe chair of judges, who was joined on the judging panel by Liz Calder, Xiaolu Guo, Afua Hirsch and Joanna MacGregor, said that The Testaments and Girl, Woman, Other were \u201cfully engaged novels, they are both linguistically inventive, they are adventurous in all kinds of ways. They address the world today and give us insights into it and create characters who resonate with us, and will resonate with us for ages\u201d.\n\nEvaristo\u2019s novel, he said, was \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d, with \u201csomething utterly magnificent about the full cast of characters\u201d; the novelist set out to write in a polyphonic series of voices as a \u201cstrategy against invisibility\u201d, because \u201cwe black British women know that if we don\u2019t write ourselves into literature, no one else will\u201d. Atwood\u2019s novel, meanwhile, is \u201cmore politically urgent than ever before\u201d.\n\nHow to write a Booker contender \u2013 by Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie and others Read more\n\n\u201cThese are big ambitious books,\u201d said Florence. \u201cOne of the learnings I\u2019ve had is that all the literary finesse, the elegance of language, the brilliance of structure, all these go to serve whether or not the author has something really valuable to say. These books both have something urgent to say and they also happen to be wonderfully compelling page-turning thrillers, which I think can speak to the most literary audience, as well as to readers who are only reading one book, or in this case two books, a year.\u201d\n\nThe two novels beat four other titles to the win: Lucy Ellmann\u2019s Ducks, Newburyport, Chigozie Obioma\u2019s An Orchestra of Minorities, Elif Shafak\u2019s 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World and Salman Rushdie\u2019s Quichotte.\n\n\u201cNobody was taking this lightly but equally there was a sense of perspective \u2013 we are judging a book prize, and this is a celebration of great literature,\u201d said Florence. \u201cThere are opportunities to be joyful here.\u201d", "description": "Judging panel break rules in choosing The Testaments and Girl, Woman, Other as joint winners", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb52dd32fab9613e15d2ce65908f9857ed6acf7a/0_109_4527_2716/master/4527.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=80616c0d5b3f875d753d00f7df65d532", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
