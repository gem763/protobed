The festival is also called Dussehra and marks the victory of Rama over the demon king Ravana.\n\nThe festival is celebrated at the end of Navaratri every year, and the chief feature of Dussehra celebrations is the burning of effigies of Ravana, his brother Kumbhakarna, and his son Indrajit, also known as Meghnad. This represents the final destruction of evil and the victory of good.\n\nIn Hindu mythology, Ravana is depicted as having ten heads, which are interpreted in various ways. The heads are said to symbolise six shastras and four Vedas, as Ravana is said to have been a great scholar who had mastered 64 types of knowledge and all arts of weaponry. A learned man, Ravana also has to his credit more than a dozen texts, including the Shiva Tandava Stotra, a popular hymn in praise of Shiva.\n\nBut Ravana\u2019s 10 heads also symbolise vices. In spite of his great intellect, the demon king is said to have been a slave to his senses. He could not control his desires, and as a result he not only brought about his own destruction, but also had the whole of his kingdom reduced to ashes. Having vast knowledge and yet being unable to harness his powers was one of Ravana\u2019s biggest regrets as he lay dying, according to the Ramayana.\n\nRavana may have been a mythological figure, but his story holds a lesson for us. We also become like Ravana when, under the influence of vices, we create wasteful and negative thoughts that spring up like the heads of the demon king. When we stop one thought, another arises, and this goes on until we end up spending a lot of time and energy battling these thoughts or simply submitting to them. Wasteful and negative thoughts come fast, sap our energy, clutter the mind, rob it of clarity, and erode our power of judgment.\n\nScriptures speak of how discernment gets affected when a person is a slave to the senses. When a man thinks of objects, attachment to them arises; from attachment desire is born; from desire anger arises. From anger comes delusion; from delusion the loss of memory; from loss of memory the destruction of discrimination; from the destruction of discrimination a person dies spiritually, they tell us.\n\nThe mind that follows in the wake of the wandering senses carries away one\u2019s discrimination as the wind carries away a boat on the waters.\n\nSo how does one overcome all the negativity symbolised by Ravana? By abandoning all desires and ego, living in this world and performing actions, but without attachment. This is possible only when the mind has been empowered with knowledge and by communion with God through meditation. Spiritual knowledge reveals the true nature of things, what is of lasting value and what is worthless. As a consequence, we stop chasing after momentary pleasures and getting distracted by desires.\n\nMeditation, remembrance of God, boosts the soul\u2019s immunity to eventually make it impervious to external influences. When nothing attracts or repels the soul, unnecessary thinking stops. Doubts, fears and worries no longer sprout like the heads of Ravana to bewilder and dispirit us. This is the true victory we should resolve to attain this Vijayadasami.", "description": "By B K Brij Mohan Vijayadasami marks the culmination of Durga Puja, commemorating goddess Durga\u2019s victory over the demon Mahishasura to restore and protect dharma.
