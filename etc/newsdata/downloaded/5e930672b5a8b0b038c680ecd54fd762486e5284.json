An appellate court in Pennsylvania ruled in July 2018 in favor of a policy that supported transgender students, despite a challenge from other students who said sharing bathrooms with transgender students would infringe on their rights to privacy, among other laws.\n\n\u201cThere has been striking uniformity over the past three years where judges who are confronted with real trans students, and real evidence, are finding that there is simply no basis for treating boys and girls who are transgender differently than other boys and girls,\u201d Mr. Block said.\n\nJudge Wright Allen\u2019s ruling on Friday culminates a lengthy legal process in Mr. Grimm\u2019s case.\n\nHe sued in July 2015. The school board argued in essence that its policy, adopted in 2014, was valid because Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 allows for claims only on the basis of sex, rather than gender identity, and that its policy did not violate the equal protection clause.\n\nThe case took a complicated path through the courts.\n\nPartway through the proceedings, in March 2017, the Trump administration rescinded protections for transgender students.\n\nThe Supreme Court then vacated a prior appeals court decision in favor of Mr. Grimm and sent the case back to the federal appeals court in Virginia for further consideration in light of the new guidance from the Trump administration. The case was later returned to the District Court.\n\nIn May 2018, Judge Wright Allen, who was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama, denied a motion by the school board to dismiss the lawsuit.", "description": "The ruling is an important victory for transgender rights advocates as legal battles over school bathroom policies continue to play out across the country.", "authors": ["Mihir Zaveri"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/09/multimedia/09xp-transgender/09xp-transgender-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-09"}
