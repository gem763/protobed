Absolutely not.\n\nThere is the possibility, still, of a deal, with Number 10 today stressing it was still their primary aim.\n\nWhispers again about a Northern Ireland only backstop, and a bigger role for the Stormont assembly, if it ever gets up and running, are doing the rounds.\n\nSome MPs and some diplomats are more cheerful about the possibilities of it working out.\n\nIf you squint, you can see the chance of an agreement being wrapped up at pace, although it seems the chances range somewhere between slim and negligible.\n\nRead more from Laura.\n\nMeanwhile, MPs backed calls, by 311 votes to 302, for the publication of government communications relating to the suspension of Parliament and no-deal Brexit plans, known as Operation Yellowhammer.\n\nFormer Conservative Dominic Grieve, the newly independent MP who tabled the motion, told MPs it was \"entirely reasonable\" to ask for the disclosure \"so the House can understand the risks involved and this can be communicated more widely to the public\".\n\nBut cabinet minister Michael Gove, who is in charge of no-deal preparations, said he had given evidence to the EU select committee on Yellowhammer and he hoped \"those assurances were sufficient\".\n\nImage copyright UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor Image caption Minister Michael Gove said he had given evidence to the EU select committee on Yellowhammer\n\nAttorney General Geoffrey Cox questioned the legal right of the government to require employees - including the PM's top aide Dominic Cummings - to open up their private email accounts and personal mobiles to scrutiny.\n\nAfter the vote, a government spokesman said it would \"consider the implications and respond in due course\".\n\nEarlier on Monday, Mr Johnson held talks with Leo Varadkar in Dublin, his first meeting with the Irish prime minister since he entered No 10.\n\nThe Irish border has proved a key sticking point in attempts to agree a Brexit deal between the UK and the EU.", "description": "In unusual scenes in the Commons, MPs sing songs and hold up signs to protest against the suspension.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07mxgks.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
