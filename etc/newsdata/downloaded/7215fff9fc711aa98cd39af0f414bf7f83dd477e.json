Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the lead Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that she had written a letter to Attorney General William Barr \u201cdemanding that the whistleblower report be transmitted to Congress, which is required by law.\u201d", "description": "The House speaker is calling on the acting director of national intelligence to turn over the complaint to Congress, hinting at the potential for Trump's...", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d87c4fd210000c800d94f6a.jpeg?cache=ivim5m4etj&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
