He\u2019ll likely discuss railway projects and trade curbs with the officials, while also addressing concerns around the contested region of Kashmir ahead of Xi\u2019s visit to India later this week.\n\nPakistan has been one of the largest beneficiaries of China\u2019s Belt & Road Initiative, Xi\u2019s flagship program to build a network of railways, ports, pipelines and highways linking Asia, Europe and Africa. China has financed billions of dollars of power and road projects in Pakistan, boosting infrastructure in the South Asian nation but also saddling it with debt.\n\nWhile most of the early projects have now been completed, the second phase of the program has been slow to start. Official data shows foreign direct investment from China plunged 77% to $461 million in the fiscal year through June from $2 billion in the previous year.\n\nPakistan\u2019s debt problems, which led the government to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund once again, have also prompted the nation to scale back some projects. The South Asian nation owes China more than double what it owes the IMF over the next three years.\n\nChina has sought to tighten oversight of Belt and Road projects amid growing concerns the program is loading poorer nations with unsustainable debt. China\u2019s ambassador to Pakistan, Yao Jing, recently said the economic corridor projects between the two nations are \u201crunning according to our satisfaction and there is no slowdown in it.\u201d\n\nPakistan has reduced its Chinese loans to upgrade a colonial-era railway by $2 billion to $6.2 billion, and wants to cut it down by another $2 billion, according to the nation\u2019s railways minister. Khan will likely discuss the project during his trip to Beijing this week, as well as Chinese curbs on agricultural exports from Pakistan, including on rice, wheat, corn, soybean, sugar and tobacco, according to state-run Radio Pakistan.\n\nKashmir Tensions\n\nRegional security will also be on the agenda, with Khan expected to discuss the situation in Kashmir with Xi before the Chinese leader visits Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi later this week in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.\n\nIndia scrapped decades of autonomy in the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir, straining relations with Pakistan. Kashmir, in the Himalayas, has been divided between India and Pakistan since independence from British rule, and is claimed by both. Two of the nations\u2019 three wars were fought over the territory. China also claims part of the area.\n\nBurzine Waghmar, a member of the Centre for the Study of Pakistan at SOAS University of London, said Khan will unlikely get strong assurances from Beijing on Kashmir.\n\n\u201cXi will definitely not publicly proclaim questionable objections about Article 370 and Kashmir on the eve of his informal working visit to Tamil Nadu on the heels of hosting Khan,\u201d he said.", "description": "Pakistan PM\u00a0Khan Tries to Rally Support for Chinese Investment", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picc0468a3d1e848e48950d2ba280585ecc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
