(Scott Eisen/Getty Images)\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) seemingly agreed with a voter who suggested that President Trump\u2019s actions are \u201cmentally retarded.\u201d\n\nAt a campaign stop in New Hampshire, Harris took questions from a crowd of voters, one of whom asked a lengthy question in which he described the fear many immigrants feel because of President Trump\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do in the next one year to diminish the mentally retarded action of this guy,\u201d the man asked.\n\n\u201cWell said, well said,\u201d Harris replied, with a laugh.\n\nShe then told the man that she would use the power of the bully pulpit to offer support for immigrants and that \u201cunless you are Native American, or your ancestors were kidnapped and brought over on a slave ship, your people are immigrants. So let\u2019s just be honest about that, and speak our values based on our shared lived values.\u201d\n\nAsked about her response Saturday, Harris apologized and called the words \u201cincredibly offensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard him talk about the other stuff. And then that came later. It was not something I really heard or processed,\u201d said Harris, who went on to describe her \u201clong-standing relationship of advocacy for our disability community.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, the Senator said she didn\u2019t hear the words the man used. \u201cIf I had I would\u2019ve stopped and corrected him. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, as the video circulated on social media platforms, many activists demanded an apology.\n\nNyle DiMarco, an advocate for the deaf community, tweeted \u201c1) R-word is unacceptable. It is a slur, an insult. 2) Kamala should have handled this better. An apology is needed.\u201d\n\nKendally Brown, a disabled health-care advocate, tweeted, \u201cUsing \u2018retarded\u2019 as a slur and an insult is never, EVER \u2018well said\u2019, @KamalaHarris, no matter who it\u2019s against and no matter the larger point being made. It's ALWAYS a betrayal of the disability community.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Nut job,\u2019 \u2018wacko,\u2019 \u2018basket case\u2019: How Donald Trump\u2019s put-downs may impact mental health stigma]\n\nHarris recently released a plan aimed to improve opportunities for disabled Americans, the first candidate in the sprawling Democratic field to do so. In that plan, Harris promised to create new senior-level positions in the White House to focus on accessibility for people with disabilities, as well as requiring those receiving federal funding for transportation and housing projects to demonstrate that their plans are fully accessible.\n\n\u201cWhen we ensure that every American with disabilities is able to fully participate in our schools, our workplaces, and all aspects of our communities, our country is stronger,\u201d Harris said in a statement issued with that policy proposal.\n\nThe exchange Friday comes in a week of tough questions for Harris. Reporters at multiple stops on her New Hampshire asked Harris about her stagnant poll numbers, most of which show her as the fourth-most popular candidate in the field behind Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and former vice president Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThe issue of polls to me, depending on the polls, sample size, the day of the week \u2014 I\u2019m not riding polls,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI don\u2019t ride on that roller coaster. I\u2019m working hard. We are steady. I don\u2019t get high with the polls, I don\u2019t get low with the polls.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I am feeling very good about where my campaign is,\u201d Harris said in response to yet another question. \u201cI\u2019m seeing the momentum.\u201d", "description": "The senator later said she misheard, called the language \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201churtful.\u201d", "authors": ["Chelsea Janes", "Reporter Covering The Presidential Campaign", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ahG0RkIjuWU3xFF3I80uAXQFvEU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PEHMGTGRVMI6TMU3UUUNZAQVJI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
