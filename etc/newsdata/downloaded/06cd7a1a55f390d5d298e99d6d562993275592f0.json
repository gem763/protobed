Truth is also more disturbing than fiction. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the abortion industry, where baby parts are meticulously collected and systemically labeled for immediate, profitable sale.\n\nNot only so, but all this takes place without the knowledge of the mother, who recovers in a waiting room nearby. And, if the reports are accurate, some of the slicing and dicing is done while the baby is still alive.\n\nDid I say that truth is more disturbing than fiction?\n\nFor the last 11 years, I have been doing live, daily radio broadcasts five days a week, taking calls, tackling controversies, and interviewing guests. And it is exceedingly rare that the words of a guest or caller are so troubling that I am literally moved to tears.\n\nBut that is exactly what happened when I interviewed Mat Staver, Founder and Chairman of Liberty Counsel, a Christian legal organization which is now defending Sandra Merritt against Planned Parenthood.\n\nMerritt is described as \u201ca courageous pro-life grandmother who exposed Planned Parenthood's horrific trade in baby body parts.\u201d Together with David Daleiden, founder of the Center for Medical Progress, Merritt recorded secret videos of Planned Parenthood leaders and workers discussing the sale of baby parts for profit, creating shockwaves for the abortion giant.\n\nNow, as the trial proceeds, shocking, heartrending testimonies are being heard.\n\nOn my show, Staver referred to situations where Planned Parenthood clinics \u201cwere taking babies and intentionally aborting them so they could harvest intact organs, some of which were born alive while the hearts were still beating. Hearts were being removed while they were still alive.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cBrains were being removed while the hearts were still beating, and we have evidence where they sliced the baby\u2019s face in two with a scalpel and then extracted the brain while the baby was still alive.\u201d\n\nWho can imagine such things? Who would even envision them in a work of fiction? Yet, according to Staver, these are 100 percent, accurate accounts. And the motivating force behind these allegations is greed.\n\nLet that sink in for a moment.\n\nFor good reason Staver spoke of Planned Parenthood\u2019s \u201cinhumane, unthinkable, unspeakable acts.\u201d\n\nYet Planned Parenthood was not alone in its savaging of the unborn.\n\nAccording to Staver, companies like Stem Express had full menus on their website where you could make customized choices when ordering your baby parts.\n\nHe explained, \u201cYou could actually go on the website and select . . . that you wanted a certain heart at a certain gestation at a certain size, intact. Then Stem Express would take that to Planned Parenthood that day. They would fulfill that order from those babies that were brought in, never telling the parent, the mom, what was happening with her child in the room next door.\u201d\n\nStaver was not exaggerating when he stated that if he described such procedures without revealing the age of the victim, we would think this was coming from Nazi Germany.\n\nPrecisely so.\n\nA recent report on the Liberty Counsel website carried the headline, \u201cSelling Baby Scalps,\u201d stating that, \u201cA former board director for the Center for Medical Progress testified during the civil trial in the San Francisco Federal District Court that the scalps of babies provided by the abortion industry are being harvested for research in treating baldness.\u201d\n\nYes, selling baby scalps for treating baldness.\n\nThe mind boggles when trying to comprehend such cruel, cold, and calculated barbarity. Yet we dare not close our eyes or stick our heads in the sand. All this is happening on our watch.\n\nIn my new book, Jezebel\u2019s War with America, I document the clear connection between radical feminism, witchcraft, and the militant pro-abortion movement. (Yes, I actually document this.)\n\nI also compare the horrific, ancient practice of child sacrifice with late-term and partial-birth abortion procedures. Perhaps this doesn\u2019t sound so extreme to you after hearing some of Staver\u2019s testimony?\n\nIronically, after Pastor Robert Jeffress made a similar comparison during a recent radio interview, referencing Moloch, the ancient god of child sacrifice, leftists responded with sarcastic glee.\n\nNot surprisingly, most of the Democratic presidential candidates are veering further to the left when it comes to abortion, to the point that most of the candidates now support bills which, if enacted, would legalize some of the crimes committed by abortionist Kermit Gosnell.\n\nAnd all of this leads to a simple question: What are you and I going to do to stop these horrific practices? And how can we offer a message of life and hope to mothers and fathers who want to abort?\n\nSomehow, someway, we must shout to the nation the humanity of that unborn child and the sacredness of life. Then, just as loudly, we must bring to the attention of the nation the barbarity of the actions of Planned Parenthood and their cohorts.\n\nIf each of us does our part, through sharing the message, through pro-life activism, through voting and campaigning, through prayer and compassion, the tide can turn.\n\nWe owe it to the little ones to take action today.", "description": "Truth is not only stranger than fiction.
