We feel incredibly proud for taking part in such an important day \u2013 Mery Perell\u00f3 and Rafa Nadal\u2019s wedding.\n\n\u2018We would like to congratulate the gorgeous and unique couple, we wish you the best forever!\u2019\n\nRafa and Mery have been together for 14 years (Picture: Getty)\n\nDiscussing the dress, Rosa explained it is \u2018an exquisitely clean-lined haute couture design.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The bodice, with jewel neckline and long sleeves, was made of beautiful Art Deco-inspired French lace with delicate patterning, flower motifs and microbeading on the meticulously hand-embroidered fabric.\n\n\u2018The ballgown-style skirt, made of silk crepe, featured a weightless detachable train, created in Rosa Clara\u2019s Atelier.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018The whole process was full of emotions between all of us. We just want to thank the whole family for trusting in us, you\u2019re extraordinary.\u2019\n\nRafael and Mery said their \u201cI Dos\u201d at the stunning La Fortaleza, Spain\u2019s most expensive property.\n\nWell, if you\u2019re going to get married, you might as well go all out\u2026\n\nAnd they were joined by royalty on the day, with former king of Spain Juan Carlos I leading the famous faces.\n\nTennis players Feliciano L\u00f3pez and Juan Monaco were also seen making their way into the venue.\n\nThanks for the invite, huns.\n\nAnd it turns out the Fortress is a popular wedding venue for other sports stars, as Gareth Bale married Emma Rhys-Jones there back in July.\n\nRafael and Mery have been dating for around 14 years, and got engaged back in May, 2018.\n\nBut, despite being one of the biggest sportsmen in the world, the Wimbledon champion has kept their romance largely out of the spotlight.\n\nHowever, he opened up about the prospect of starting a family with Mery in the future, in a chat with Hello! Magazine.\n\nSpeaking about their future together, he said: \u2018Obviously, I have the intention of forming a family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I love children and I would like my children to do what they like.\u2019\n\nMery is often on the sidelines watching Rafa play (Picture: Getty)\n\nMery has been a regular fixture at Rafael\u2019s games in the past, but previously explained that she wouldn\u2019t be following her beau around the world full-time anytime soon.\n\nIn a candid chat with The Telegraph, she said: \u2018Travelling together everywhere, even if I could, would not be good either for him or for me.\n\n\u2018He needs his space when he is competing, and just the idea of me hanging around waiting on his needs all day wears me out. It would asphyxiate me.\n\n\u2018And then he would have to be worrying about me \u2026 No. If I followed him everywhere, I think there\u2019s a risk we might stop getting along.\u2019\n\nWhich is fair enough.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Nadal\u2019s reps for a comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
