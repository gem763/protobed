It is why, throughout my years, I have had the highest regard for women who choose to be at home [with] their kids, because I don\u2019t know how you do that all day long.\n\n\u201cNobody gives women the credit they deserve.\u201d\n\nWinfrey continued by explaining why she and Graham decided to remain engaged for so long, admitting that she believes things \u201cwould have changed\u201d if they had got married.\n\n\u201cI used to think about this all the time, that I was working these 17-hour days, and so were my producers, and then I go home and I have my two dogs and I have Stedman, who\u2019s letting me be who I need to be in the world,\" she said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never demanding anything from me like, \u2018Where\u2019s my breakfast? Where\u2019s my dinner?\u2019 Never any of that, which I believed would have changed had we married.\u201d\n\nWinfrey adds: \u201cBoth he and I now say, \u2018If we had married, we would not be together\u2019.\n\n\u201cNo question about it \u2014 we would not stay married, because of what that would have meant to him, and I would have had my own ideas about it.\u201d\n\nWinfrey\u2019s decisions to not marry or have children are ones she still stands by today, explaining that she has \u201cfilled that maternal fold\u201d with charitable work.\n\n\u201cI have not had one regret about that,\u201d Winfrey explained.\n\n\u201cI also believe that part of the reason why I don\u2019t have regrets is because I got to fulfil it in the way that was best for me: the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThose girls fill that maternal fold that I perhaps would have had. In fact, they overfill \u2014 I\u2019m overflowed with maternal.\"", "description": "Oprah Winfrey says she does not have any regrets over deciding to not marry or have children.
