Both men, along with their production company -- Rabbit Bandini -- and its general manager, Jay Davis, are all named as defendants in the suit, per The New York Times.\n\nReps for Franco and Jolivette did not immediately respond to Fox News' requests for comment. Davis did not immediately respond. The phone number listed for Rabbit Bandini was disconnected when Fox News reached out.\n\nThe suit claimed Tither-Kaplan, Gaal and other students paid about $300 a month in tuition and in return, they were told they would have opportunities to audition for Franco and be cast in Rabbit Bandini film productions not available to anyone else. However, they allegedly found out later that was not the case as \u201cnon-students had equal access.\u201d\n\nFRANCO DENIES SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS ON 'LATE SHOW'\n\nAs the Times reported, Studio 4 also included master classes that would cost an additional fee of up to about $2,000 each, including a $750 master class for sex scenes. Per the outlet, the lawsuit claimed that for the sex-scenes class, students had to audition on video so Franco could review the material later. They also allegedly had to sign away rights to the recordings.\n\nThe women further alleged they were encouraged to push beyond their comfort zones and were denied industry guidelines such as nudity riders, the report said. The suit claimd the class sought \u201coften young and inexperienced females\u201d who \u201cwere routinely pressured to engage in simulated sex acts that went far beyond the standards in the industry.\u201d\n\nJAMES FRANCO ACCUSED OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT BY 5 WOMEN, GRILLED BY SETH MEYERS\n\nTither-Kaplan -- who said she took the class -- alleged she often was asked to appear in nude scenes or sex scenes for roles in Franco's independent films, some of which still reportedly haven't been released. She further claimed that once during the filming for an orgy scene, Franco removed plastic guards that covered other actresses' vaginas while he simulated oral sex on them, the Times reported, citing the lawsuit.\n\nPer the outlet, the suit sought monetary damages and the return of any recordings of former students, as well as to attain a class-action status that would allow others to join.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nTither-Kaplan was one of several women who came forward in 2018 with allegations of \u201cinappropriate or sexually exploitative\u201d behavior against Franco in a Los Angeles Times report.\n\nAt the time, Franco's attorney, Michael Plonsker, disputed the women's allegations to the outlet. Gaal chose to come forward for the first time, The Associated Press reported.", "description": "Two former students of James Franco's now-defunct acting school filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court\u00a0on Thursday alleging the program existed mainly to provide a way for Franco and his collaborators to take advantage of young women.", "authors": ["Mariah Haas"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/RT-James-Franco.jpg"}
