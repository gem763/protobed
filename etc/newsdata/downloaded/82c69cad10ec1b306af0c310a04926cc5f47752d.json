My mind was already set that he might pull out.'\n\nDereck Chisora will now have to focus on beating David Price after Parker's withdrawal\n\nChisora admitted he had unfinished business with former WBO heavyweight title holder Parker, and was sceptical of Parker's reasoning for withdrawing.\n\n'I told him the truth [when we met] and he didn't like it. Then I heard he's got a spider bite. Whatever.'\n\nChisora's manager, former heavyweight champion David Haye, comically questioned whether a rearranged fight would be possible.\n\nJoseph Parker's last fight was a 10th-round knockout victory against Alex Leapai in June\n\n'If he gets well soon. What powers will he have after a spider bite? It worked out well for Peter Parker,' Haye joked.\n\nMeanwhile, Parker's manager David Higgins insisted that his fighter is still very keen to face Chisora, but confirmed Parker had no choice but to pull out.\n\n'He's in good spirits, he's back in training. I saw the British media sort of mocked the spider bite thing, but the honest feeling for the doctors, we think it actually was a spider bite,' Higgins maintained.\n\n'I'm no expert, but it sort of destroys your immune system, your health. You are fatigued. He was ordered by medical professionals to stand down for three weeks.\n\n'Make no mistake, we wanted to fight Chisora, we still do. We'll just see what happens.'\n\nDavid Price has stepped in to fight Chisora at the 02 Arena in London on October 26\n\nNonetheless Chisora, who has a 31-9 professional record, will still fight on the 02 Arena card in nine days time against compatriot David Price, who is 25-6 in his career.\n\nThe pair are actually good friends, but Chisora exclaimed that friendship will go out the window in the lead-up to the fight.\n\nThe bout will co-headline the London event alongside Josh Taylor and Regis Prograis' world super-lightweight unification fight.", "description": "New Zealander Parker withdrew from the October\u00a026 fight at the O2 Arena after illness caused by a spider bite - David Price will now face Chisora instead in an all-British affair.", "authors": ["Kieran Jackson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/13/19835346-0-image-a-64_1571314193875.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
