(Charlie Riedel/AP)\n\nSean Cormie said that everything about the Sunday service was going fine, right up to the moment the pastor began preaching about the sin of homosexuality.\n\nThe 23-year-old gay man said he was there Sept. 8 with his partner, Gary Gardner, because his mother and stepfather are youth pastors at the Blackwell, Okla., church. He wanted to worship with them.\n\nThen, Cormie said, First Assembly of God Pastor Bill McKissick\u2019s sermon veered. He paced around the room and said there was someone in the church at that moment who was guilty of homosexuality, an \u201cabomination of a sin,\u201d according to Cormie.\n\nThat\u2019s when the pastor pointed straight at Cormie and Gardner, Cormie said in the Facebook post he wrote about the incident, and members of the congregation stood up and circled around them, \u201cpraying the spirit of homosexuality out of us,\u201d Cormie wrote.\n\nWhen the couple rose to leave, he said, Cormie\u2019s grandmother pushed Gardner, who then got up and ran out of the church. Cormie describes being pinned down by family members and other congregants, about a dozen people in total, then slammed into a wall and punched in the face.\n\nAll the while, he says, they were yelling and crying, trying to \u201cpray the gay away.\u201d\n\nAs soon as Cormie broke free, he reported the incident to the Blackwell Police Department, according to KFOR, an NBC affiliate in Oklahoma City. Police Chief Dewayne Wood told The Washington Post that the incident is being investigated and that a report will be available when more details emerge.\n\n\u201cI was so embarrassed,\u201d Gardner told KFOR. \u201cI felt about two inches tall when this started.\u201d\n\n[Conversion therapy center founder who sought to turn LGBTQ Christians straight says he\u2019s gay]\n\nGardner didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. Cormie referred The Post to his message on Facebook and answered some questions about the incident.\n\nThe Pentecostal church\u2019s pastors, McKissick and his wife, Tami, told KFOR in a statement that the incident was a \u201cfamily matter that escalated.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur church would never condone restraint of any person unless they were engaged in violent activity,\u201d the McKissicks said. \u201cThere is much more to this incident, and we are cooperating fully with law enforcement to hopefully bring all of the facts to light as a rush to judgment is not in anyone\u2019s best interest.\u201d\n\nNo one answered calls to the church Wednesday morning.\n\nCormie, who came out last spring, told KFOR that he believes homosexuality is a sin but that it\u2019s also his nature. The Assemblies of God believes that homosexuality is a sin but that one can seek reconciliation, according to one of the church\u2019s position papers.\n\nNancy Petty, senior pastor at Pullen Memorial Baptist Church in Raleigh, N.C., doesn\u2019t agree with the Assemblies\u2019 view. She said every week, she sees true believers who are gay and who are struggling to accept themselves and their faith simultaneously.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I say to them is that you are God\u2019s beloved child just as you are with no need to be any different than who you are,\u201d she said, adding that the church has used the Bible for years to oppress gay people, slaves and women.\n\nMatthew Vines, author of \u201cGod and the Gay Christian,\u201d said many LGBTQ Christians often resolve the tension between their orientation or identities by leaving the church or faith, reassessing key passages of the Bible that are often used to condemn homosexuality, and learning to live with internal battles of being gay and having faith.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just people who are trying to live the best they can,\u201d he said of the third option. \u201cThey also recognize that\u2019s not a livable belief.\"\n\nPetty said it\u2019s inexplicable for a church to try to \u201cpray the gay out\u201d of people in 2019.\n\n\u201cFind a community that can support you, nurture you and help you at least hear some different perspectives,\u201d she said.\n\nMark Forrester, senior director of public relations and communication for Assemblies of God, said church officials weren\u2019t familiar with the allegations against First Assembly of God.\n\n\u201cThe Assemblies of God believes that all people are created in the image of God and are worthy of respect and dignity, regardless of their personal beliefs,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe certainly condemn any acts of violence or acts against an individual\u2019s will.\u201d\n\nH. Frank Cargill, superintendent of the Oklahoma Assemblies of God Ministries, said he had no firsthand knowledge of the incident.\n\n\u201cThe Assemblies of God churches of Oklahoma welcomes and treats with respect, compassion, and sensitivity all who experience same-sex attractions. We hold no malice toward, or fear of, homosexuals and those struggling with sexual identity. Such attitudes are not of Christ,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nCormie said he doesn\u2019t believe all churches are like First Assembly of God.\n\n\u201cI am a proud gay Christian,\u201d he said in his Facebook post. \u201cPraying daily to God for justice and mercy on these sad acts of the church\u2019s actions as a whole.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nPence isn\u2019t \u2018anti-gay\u2019 because he lunched with Irish prime minister, who is gay, White House aide says\n\n\u2018Riverdale\u2019 to receive award from gay rights education group\n\nThe ex-gay Christianity movement is making a quiet comeback.
