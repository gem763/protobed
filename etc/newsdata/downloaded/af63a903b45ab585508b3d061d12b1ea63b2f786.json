REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/File Photo\n\nThe French warning comes after President Emmanuel Macron met the Finnish prime minister in Paris on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to say that time is running out and that we won\u2019t be negotiating directly at the European Council in mid-October,\u201d the source said.\n\nFinnish media cited Prime Minister Antti Rinne as saying he and Macron had agreed an end-September deadline for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to present Europe with a concrete proposal to avoid a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe source said this had been the message already conveyed by Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel last month.\n\nAfter his meeting with Macron at the Elysee palace on Wednesday, the Finnish premier said Britain has until end-September to explain how they will avoid crashing out of the EU, according to Finnish news agency STT.\n\n\u201cIf there is no proposals - and I believe that quite a few European country leaders will agree with the position we reached with Macron today - then, it\u2019s over,\u201d Rinne was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cWe are a bit worried over what is happening at the moment in Britain and the mess which is created in Europe,\u201d he added\n\nSeparately, two senior EU diplomats said there was no firm deadline of Sept 30 and no deadline has been discussed among the 27, but one added that there was a realization that the end of September was as late as the UK could go to avoid a failure at the Oct. 17-18 summit.\n\n\u201cThe 30th is not a precise date discussed and agreed by the 27. But these issues are not easy to tackle. If you want to prepare properly for the summit, the 30th of September is already tight,\u201d the EU diplomat told Reuters.\n\n\u201cIf you are too late the council will not be able to produce any meaningful results.\u201d", "description": "Time to agree a Brexit deal is running out and it will be too late for European leaders to iron out a deal at a European Council meeting in Brussels in mid-October, a French diplomatic source said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431543796&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0JC", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
