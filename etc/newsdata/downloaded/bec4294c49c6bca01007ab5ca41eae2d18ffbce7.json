This latest cabinet is a first glimpse at great things to come from Konami.\u2019\n\nNow there\u2019s a threat if ever we heard one.\n\nThe last video game released in the Silent Hill series was the awful Silent Hill: Book Of Memories in 2012, but Silent Hills was to have been a major revamp for the franchise. It only got as far as the P.T. demo though, before Hideo Kojima was forced out of Konami and the whole project was cancelled.\n\nWhether Konami will ever consider making another Silent Hill game is unclear, but we suppose some of that depends on how well this gambling machine does.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Super Bomberman R gets Silent Hill crossover\n\nMORE: Silent Hills confirmed cancelled, P.T. to be removed from PSN\n\nMORE: World\u2019s biggest Silent Hill fan \u2013 Reader\u2019s Feature", "description": "Konami has revealed a new Silent Hill game, but it\u2019s not quite the equivalent to P.T. that fans would've hoped for...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/james4_1571047913.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
