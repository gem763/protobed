They can ask Google, for example, to remove a link. The French regulator then wanted that rule applied to all of Google\u2019s domains, even outside the EU, and asked the EU\u2019s top for advice.\n\nThe ECJ said Tuesday that there \u201cis no obligation under EU law for a search engine operator\u201d to extend the rule beyond the EU states.\n\nIt said, however, that a search engine operator must put measures in place to discourage internet users from going outside the EU to find that information.\n\nThe case highlights the need to balance data privacy and protection concerns against the public\u2019s right to information. It also raises questions about how to enforce differing jurisdictions when it comes to the borderless internet.\n\nIn a reaction to the ruling, Google\u2019s Senior Privacy Counsel Peter Fleischer said \u201cit\u2019s good to see that the Court agreed with our arguments\u201d and added that Google had worked hard \u201cto strike a sensible balance between people\u2019s rights of access to information and privacy.\u201d\n\nThe European Commission noted that the court again confirmed that the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d exists in the EU.\n\nThe 2014 ruling that people in the EU have the right to control what appears when their name is searched online forced Google to delete links to outdated or embarrassing personal information that popped up in searches within the 28-nation bloc.\n\nOne year later, the French privacy watchdog wanted Google to remove results on all its search engines on request, and not just European country sites like www.google.fr. Google refused and in the resulting court case, French legal authorities asked the EU\u2019s highest court for advice.\n\nOn Tuesday, the EU court said that it was not legal to apply an EU rule to business operations in countries outside the EU.\n\nThe ruling is final and becomes the benchmark on which courts in the 28-nation bloc must base their decisions relating to such cases.\n\nThose who wanted to see such an extension argue that on the internet it is easy to switch from the national versions of the web site to ones outside the EU - by switching from google.fr to google.com for example - to find the information that must be removed within the EU.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Google won a major case in the European Union on Tuesday, when the bloc's top court ruled that the U.S. internet giant doesn't have to extend the EU's \"right to be forgotten\" rules to its search engines outside the region.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Raf Casert"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/europe_google_45145_c0-103-5660-3403_s1770x1032.jpg?7730675d1e2e2353841d563013b838457b9ff4fe", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
