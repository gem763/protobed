Colorado is located just above New Mexico.\n\n'You know why we\u2019re going to win New Mexico? Because they want safety on their border. And they didn\u2019t have it. And we\u2019re building a wall on the border of New Mexico,' he said before mentioning Colorado.\n\nTrump pictured arriving to the White House after his Pittsburgh trip\n\n'Well, this is awkward\u2026 Colorado doesn\u2019t border Mexico.
