Innovation ranging from transportation and manufacturing to health care and agriculture are fundamentally changing how we live and work.\n\nEven though the United States is one of the most innovative countries in the world, innovation doesn\u2019t reside in one state or one country so developing partnerships outside our border is critical. It is therefore notable that this week, a top group of government leaders from the United States and Israel met in Washington, D.C. for the annual U.S.-Israel Joint Economic Development Group\u2019s meeting. This meeting, chaired by Israel\u2019s Minister of Finance, U.S. Secretary of Treasury, and U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, convenes economic policymakers from both countries together to map out new areas for bilateral cooperation and joint innovation.\n\nWhile our bilateral relationship is often seen through the prism of security and defense cooperation, this annual meeting underscores the growing importance of our mutually beneficial economic partnership with Israel. Hundreds of U.S. companies \u2014from Apple to Citibank to Ford Motor Company\u2013have research and development (R&D) centers in Israel, employing tens of thousands of Israeli researchers and producing an amazing array of innovative solutions. In addition, Israel is responsible for nearly 50 percent of the Middle East\u2019s investment into the U.S. despite accounting for just two percent of the region\u2019s population.\n\nAmerica\u2019s trade, investment, and innovation partnership with Israel is substantial, but in sectors such as energy, agriculture, health, cybersecurity, water, and beyond, our countries have only scratched the surface. To fully realize the potential, we need to expand the American business community\u2019s exposure and access to Israel as well as empower new supporters of the U.S.-Israel economic relationship.\n\nThat\u2019s why the U.S. Chamber of Commerce launched \u201cBusiness Israel\u201d in 2017 \u2013 a new national program that seeks to deepen and expand across America\u2019s business relationship with Israel in all 50 states.\n\nOver the past two years, CEOs from state and local chambers of commerce have traveled to Israel to learn about the opportunities, network, and forge partnerships. These state and local chambers are important champions for America\u2019s relationship with Israel in communities throughout the United States, and they serve as hubs for businesses as well as vital links to civic leaders, government officials, community organizations, and the general public.\n\nFor every state and locality, Israel invariably has something unique to offer.\n\nFor example, as a pioneer in drip irrigation and desalination, Israel has developed many innovative solutions that could help desert states across the Southwest improve water management. That\u2019s why we have worked with chambers of commerce in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, and Utah to host major conferences with the government of Israel, with the purpose of sharing best practices and technology from Israel.\n\nThere is also a huge potential for cooperation that is now being realized in the energy sector as well. Israel\u2019s development of its offshore natural gas resources is generating deep partnerships between companies and universities across the U.S. Gulf Coast, including Texas and Louisiana, with Israeli counterparts. This is contributing to Middle East regional cooperation in ways we haven\u2019t seen in a generation. In fact, Energy Secretary Rick Perry Rick PerryDemocrats say they have game changer on impeachment Diplomat says Ukraine aid was tied to political investigations Putin, Hungarian leader pushed Trump on Ukraine corruption narrative: reports MORE was in Israel and Egypt last month to promote U.S. engagement in this important area.\n\nThe Big Three automakers from Michigan are all teaming up with Israeli tech firms to improve their vehicles. Defense companies in Alabama and Mississippi are working hand-in-hand with the Israeli Defense Forces on new life-saving technologies.\n\nAnd the list goes on.\n\nAs the \u201cU.S.-Israel Cooperation Enhancement and Regional Security Act\u201d makes clear, our two nations\u2019 economic relationship has huge unrealized potential. The work Congress has done to advance new federal programs that will catalyze economic activity is critical. In tandem, we need to continue to cultivate and grow new business partners all across America.\n\nThere are thousands of state, metropolitan, and local chambers of commerce all across the country. We encourage businesses throughout the U.S. who currently have partnerships with Israel to build relationships with these chambers, share lessons learned, and help scale and deepen our economic relationship.\n\nFor business leaders that don\u2019t currently have these partnerships but may be interested, there are many opportunities available and we encourage you to reach out to your local and state chambers find out how to get involved and build these beneficial partnerships.\n\nThe U.S.-Israel economic relationship has already produced tremendous innovation and supports tens of thousands of jobs. By growing this already strong relationship, we can promote further advancements and create even more jobs. Chambers are natural allies to help expand this important relationship and catalyze those efforts.\n\nThe combination of the U.S. government\u2019s action with private sector engagement will ensure a strong and growing partnership between our two innovative economies and transform the products and companies building the future.\n\nMyron Brilliant is the executive vice president and head of International Affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
