And it has been using its facial recognition systems to keep an eye on all its citizens in all public scenarios.\n\nHowever, this new rule for getting a new mobile number takes government surveillance to a whole new level.\n\nReuters\n\nAs per recent reports, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) in China has revealed that starting December 1st, every new applicant for a new cell number will have to give in their facial recognition data to the telecom service provider upon application.\n\nAllegedly, the data is going to be used to verify that the ID card belongs to the applicant. This directive was issued by MIIT last month on September 27.\n\nAccording to MIIT, the action is being taken to 'safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of citizens in the cyberspace.' while also trying to limit internet fraud. It also claims that this will improve internet security in the nation while also combatting terrorism\n\nDon't Miss 1.5 K SHARES\n\nWhat's more, is that phone users are also banning users from sharing their numbers with others and are encouraged to verify if numbers are registered under their name without their consent.\n\nReuters\n\nChina isn't the only country that is using biometric data to issue SIM cards to its citizens. In India, today, we get SIM cards based entirely on our fingerprints that were collected along with the Aadhar card.\n\nWhen applying for a new SIM card, all the telecom operators ask for a fingerprint scan (on the tiny scanner connected to a phone), along with the address and IDs. This authenticates whether the applicant is the same person as shown on the ID.\n\nThis was started by Jio, when it was offering tempting data deals in September of 2016, resulting in people going and signing up with their biometric information willy nilly. No one thought about this then.\n\nReuters\n\nWhile conditions in India aren't as bad as China, our country still has our personal biometric information linked to a database. And we already know how Aadhar data has gotten in the hands of wrong people in the past.\n\nWe just hope that our data remains safe from harm's way and not used against us. What do you feel about the sharing of private biometric information with the government?
