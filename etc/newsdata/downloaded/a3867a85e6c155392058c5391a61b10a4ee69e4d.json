As I said at the time, this is not an impossible situation to address, but it will take time, hard work, a lot of resources and, perhaps more important than all the rest, the will to make some tough calls and get the job done.\n\nNow we\u2019re learning that the city\u2019s leaders have been working on a plan to begin to address the crisis. In a welcome announcement, an officer from the DEA sketched out the plans for a permanent strike force being established in Charm City, combining federal, state and municipal resources that will target gang leaders, major illegal drug distributors and the most violent criminals on the streets. The details make it sound as if this will be a serious (and much needed) ongoing effort, but questions remain about some of the key players involved. (Baltimore Sun)\n\nA new federal \u201cstrike force\u201d comprised of detectives, prosecutors and federal agents from across the region will begin work soon on a long-planned effort to target Baltimore drug gangs and their Mexican and Dominican suppliers, who have been flooding the city with heroin, fentanyl and other illicit drugs for years. Hoping to reduce the record number of homicides and overdoses in the city, the team already has begun working a handful of cases together, and this week secured nearly 75,000 square feet of office space in Southwest Baltimore so its members can move into a shared headquarters. Officials say that will speed up the identification, investigation and prosecution of some of Baltimore\u2019s most violent gang leaders. \u201cWe\u2019re teaming up to go after the bad actors in this city who are threatening to destabilize it,\u201d said Don Hibbert, assistant special agent in charge of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s Baltimore field office and a key organizer behind the effort. \u201cSimple as that.\u201d\n\nThis is all being organized under the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force program. The list of talent they are bringing in sounds impressive, including permanently assigned officers and agents from not only the state and municipal police departments but the DEA, BATFE, FBI, Homeland Security, and the U.S. Marshals Service.\n\nI\u2019m not going to throw cold water over these efforts because it sounds like they\u2019re building a serious crime-fighting team here. The one area of concern, however, is the involvement of Baltimore State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby. You may recall her disastrous involvement in the city\u2019s woes starting after the Freddie Gray riots. Since that time, she\u2019s generally shown more interest in prosecuting police officers than gang members.\n\nBut who knows? Perhaps the seriousness of Baltimore\u2019s current murder epidemic has finally sunk in and she\u2019s ready to start putting some of the worst of the bad guys behind bars for decades. It\u2019s long been claimed that a significant percentage of the murders in that city are being committed by a relatively small number of serial offenders from the various gangs. If they can bring them in and lock them up until they are retirement age, the just might start bringing the violent crime rates down and returning some sense of normalcy to the community.\n\nBut the other missing piece of the puzzle is the resistance of both municipal and state legislators to pass tougher gun crime laws. Until that happens, this strike force may simply become a larger version of the revolving door Baltimore currently has running in their jails.", "description": "Gotta try something", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/MarilynMosbyFB.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
