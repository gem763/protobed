Katie Hill is resigning from Congress after she reportedly admitted to having an \u201cinappropriate\u201d relationship with a staffer.\n\nThe 32-year-old, who was a rising star in the House Democratic freshman class, announced her resignation on Twitter Sunday. \u201cIt is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress. This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country,\u201d Hill said in a lengthy statement.\n\n\u201cThis is what needs to happen so that the good people who supported me will no longer be subjected to the pain inflicted by my abusive husband and the brutality of hateful political operatives who seem to happily provide a platform to a monster who is driving a smear campaign built around cyber exploitation,\u201d she continued.\n\nRELATED: California Congresswoman Katie Hill Admits to Inappropriate Relationship with Campaign Staffer\n\nThe congresswoman reportedly sent a letter to her constituents, admitting that she had engaged in an improper relationship with a campaign aide before entering Congress, according to CNN. Her confession came just hours after the House Committee on Ethics announced it was opening an investigation into Hill over allegations that she was romantically involved with a congressional staffer.\n\nRecently, the conservative website RedState published an article detailing Hill\u2019s relationship with the female staffer \u2014 alleging that the relationship was polyamorous between Hill, who identifies as bisexual, the unidentified woman and Hill\u2019s estranged husband, Kenny Heslep. The site also included a nude photo of the representative.\n\nHill referenced the private photo in her resignation statement, calling it \u201can appalling invasion of my privacy,\u201d adding: \u201cI know that as long as I am in Congress, we\u2019ll live fearful of what might come next and how much it will hurt. That\u2019s a feeling I know all too well. It\u2019s the feeling I decided to leave when I left my marriage, and one I will not tolerate being forced upon others. I can no longer allow my community, family, friends, staff, supporters, and especially the children who look up to me as a role model, to suffer this unprecedented brand of cruelty.\u201d\n\nIn addition to apologizing, Hill said, \u201cI am not a perfect person and never pretended to be.\u201d However, she called herself a \u201cfighter.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow my fight is going to be to defeat this type of exploitation that so many women are victims to and which will keep countless women and girls from running for office or entering public light,\u201d she said.\n\nIt is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress. This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country.\n\n\n\nSee my official statement below. pic.twitter.com/nG97RQIwvO\n\n\n\n\u2014 Rep.
