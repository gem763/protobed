You wouldn't want to have a controlled market, you have free markets. And free markets go up and down with interest rates, stocks, commodities, you name it.\u201d\n\nSchwab founded The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) in California in 1971 and today the company employs close to 20,000 people and has $3.77 trillion assets under management. The pioneer in the discount brokerage industry is also the author of a new book \u201cInvested: Changing Forever the Way Americans Invest.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny time is a good time to invest if you want to get ahead in life and improve wealth. You have to get in, and you have to remain in. You can't be in and out all the time,\u201d said Schwab.\n\nCharles Schwab More\n\nGetting into the markets may become easier for people now that Schwab, Interactive Brokers (IBKR), E-Trade (ETFC), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Fidelity all recently announced they will move to a zero commission model. It took 45 years for Schwab to evolve to the point where online trade commissions for U.S.- and Canadian-listed equities are fee free. According to Schwab, the decision means it impacts the company\u2019s revenues negatively by about 4% but he says the company\u2019s wealth management services will help make up the difference.\n\nSchwab encourages all investors to take a long view and not be distracted by quarterly numbers or get spooked by volatility and fear that comes with major market swings.\n\n\u201cI've been through many in my career,\u201d he said, referring to financial downturns. \u201cThe fear factor comes in and people shrivel up and sort of, oh I better sell. That's their knee jerk reaction. You don't want to do that.\u201d\n\nYvette Killian is a producer for Yahoo Finance\u2019s On The Move.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nForget FAANG, investors should consider MANG\n\nShaq on investing: 'I don\u2019t ever think about making money'\n\nWeWork 'has to give us a valuation that's reasonable': IPO expert\n\n5G will make devices more vulnerable to cyberattacks: Akamai CEO\n\nUS bankruptcy filings rose in July 2019 \u2014 what does that mean?\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Charles Schwab provides investing tips.", "authors": ["Yvette Killian"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Esu8lPs6T8LYAo2Wads1dA--~B/aD00OTEyO3c9NzM2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/9dbf3950-f047-11e9-bc95-078d78919386", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
