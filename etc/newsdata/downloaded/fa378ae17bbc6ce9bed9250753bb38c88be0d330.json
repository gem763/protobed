The Sackler family would give up control of Purdue and contribute at least $3 billion toward the settlement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than 20 states and the District of Columbia have opposed the plan, arguing that it won\u2019t provide as much money as promised and the Sacklers are getting off too easy.\n\nHERE\u2019S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE BANKRUPTCY\n\nThe initial hearing will be held in federal court in White Plains, New York, before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain.\n\nTuesday's appearance will focus on whether Purdue Pharma will be able to pay its bills while in bankruptcy, according to The Asociated Press, adding the judge may hear objections that the filing was made in \u201cbad faith.\" Those arguments could be tabled for another day.\n\nTHE DECISION\n\nDrain will eventually decide whether to approve or reject the settlement or seek modification and what will happen to the company itself.\n\nWithout a settlement, all the claimants may wind up in a race to litigate in other courts and get a judgment before the company runs out of money.\n\nTENTATIVE DEAL\n\nPurdue Pharma would continue to operate, but profits would be used to pay for the settlement.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The maker of OxyContin will have its initial bankruptcy hearing.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/05/0/0/opioids.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
