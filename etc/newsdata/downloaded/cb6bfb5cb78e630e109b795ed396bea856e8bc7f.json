When the odds of impeachment goes up, it goes down,\u201d said Phil Flynn, an analyst with Price Futures Group in Chicago. \u201cThe market doesn\u2019t like the prospect of impeachment - that\u2019s going to be a negative for the U.S. economy, it\u2019s going to be a negative on U.S.-China trade.\u201d\n\nBoth benchmarks fell for a third straight day, with Brent crude LCOc1 futures down 39 cents, or 0.6%, at $62.00 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 65 cents, or 1.2%, lower at $55.84 a barrel by 11:47 a.m. EDT (1547 GMT).\n\nPrices have been weighed down by the faster-than-expected recovery of Saudi output after the drone and missile strikes on two of its oil-processing plants, as well as a surprise 2.4-million-barrel build in U.S. crude inventories last week.\n\nSaudi Arabia, the world\u2019s top oil exporter, has restored its production capacity to 11.3 million barrels per day, sources briefed on state oil company Saudi Aramco\u2019s operations told Reuters.\n\nComments by Trump on Wednesday, which signaled that a resolution to the U.S. trade dispute with China might be near, helped limit losses.\n\nA day after delivering a stinging rebuke to China over its trade policies, Trump said Beijing wanted to make a deal and it \u201ccould happen sooner than you think.\u201d\n\nTrump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also signed a limited trade deal that would open Japanese markets to $7 billion of U.S. products annually.\n\n\u201cThe oil market has seemingly returned to business as usual,\u201d said Norbert Ruecker, head of economics and next-generation research at Julius Baer.\n\n\u201cInstead of the attack-related fallout including disruption and geopolitical risks, the soft economy and stagnant oil demand are back in focus.\u201d\n\nCrude futures were pressured by sluggish economic data in leading European economies and Japan.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not too much to be cheery about on oil markets today,\u201d said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at OANDA.", "description": "Oil fell on Thursday as new developments in an inquiry into the impeachment of U.S. President Donald Trump weighed on demand sentiment while moves to quickly restore Saudi output after attacks on its oil installations promised more oil supply.", "authors": ["Laila Kearney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1433977828&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P03X", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
