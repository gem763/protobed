Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal 1/19 Donald Trump Accused of abusing his office by pressing the Ukrainian president in a July phone call to help dig up dirt on Joe Biden, who may be his Democratic rival in the 2020 election. He also believes that Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails - a key factor in the 2016 election - may be in Ukraine, although it is not clear why. Reuters 2/19 The Whistleblower Believed to be a CIA agent who spent time at the White House, his complaint was largely based on second and third-hand accounts from worried White House staff. Although this is not unusual for such complaints, Trump and his supporters have seized on it to imply that his information is not reliable. Expected to give evidence to Congress voluntarily and in secret. Getty 3/19 The Second Whistleblower The lawyer for the first intelligence whistleblower is also representing a second whistleblower regarding the President's actions. Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower. Getty 4/19 Rudy Giuliani Former mayor of New York, whose management of the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001 won him worldwide praise. As Trump\u2019s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president\u2019s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy. In a series of eccentric TV appearances he has claimed that the US state department asked him to get involved. Giuliani insists that he is fighting corruption on Trump\u2019s behalf and has called himself a \u201chero\u201d. AP 5/19 Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin. AFP/Getty 6/19 Mike Pence The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later. However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year. Getty 8/19 Joe Biden The former vice-president is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination, which would make him Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2020 election. Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant. Reuters 9/19 Hunter Biden Joe Biden\u2019s son has been accused of corruption by the president because of his business dealings in Ukraine and China. However, Trump has yet to produce any evidence of corruption and Biden\u2019s lawyer insists he has done nothing wrong. AP 10/19 William Barr The attorney-general, who proved his loyalty to Trump with his handling of the Mueller report, was mentioned in the Ukraine call as someone president Volodymyr Zelensky should talk to about following up Trump\u2019s preoccupations with the Biden\u2019s and the Clinton emails. Nancy Pelosi has accused Barr of being part of a \u201ccover-up of a cover-up\u201d. AP 11/19 Mike Pompeo The secretary of state initially implied he knew little about the Ukraine phone call - but it later emerged that he was listening in at the time. He has since suggested that asking foreign leaders for favours is simply how international politics works. AFP via Getty 12/19 Nancy Pelosi The Democratic Speaker of the House had long resisted calls from within her own party to back a formal impeachment process against the president, apparently fearing a backlash from voters. On September 24, amid reports of the Ukraine call and the day before the White House released a partial transcript of it, she relented and announced an inquiry, saying: \u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d Getty 13/19 Adam Schiff Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, one of the three committees leading the inquiry. He was criticized by Republicans for giving what he called a \u201cparody\u201d of the Ukraine phone call during a hearing, with Trump and others saying he had been pretending that his damning characterisation was a verbatim reading of the phone call. He has also been criticised for claiming that his committee had had no contact with the whistleblower, only for it to emerge that the intelligence agent had contacted a staff member on the committee for guidance before filing the complaint. The Washington Post awarded Schiff a \u201cfour Pinocchios\u201d rating, its worst rating for a dishonest statement. Reuters 14/19 Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman Florida-based businessmen and Republican donors Lev Parnas (pictured with Rudy Giuliani) and Igor Fruman were arrested on suspicion of campaign finance violations at Dulles International Airport near Washington DC on 9 October. Separately the Associated Press has reported that they were both involved in efforts to replace the management of Ukraine's gas company, Naftogaz, with new bosses who would steer lucrative contracts towards companies controlled by Trump allies. There is no suggestion of any criminal activity in these efforts. Reuters 15/19 Kurt Volker The former US ambassador to NATO was appointed special envoy to Ukraine, and is thought to have played a role in linking Giuliani with Ukraine officials. He resigned just before giving evidence to Congress, which had subpoenaed him. After his testimony it emerged that he had apparently told Giuliani that he was being fed false information about the Bidens from Ukrainian officials.

She was abruptly recalled from her post in May 2019 amid claims that she was not co-operating with Rudy Giuliani\u2019s unorthodox activities in Ukraine. In the Ukraine phone call Trump refers to her as \u201cthe woman\u201d and \u201cbad news\u201d and hints darkly at some sort of retribution, saying: \u201cWell, she\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d Subpoenaed to give evidence to Congress.

Getty\n\nAnd you see it time and time again played out on Fox with reference to the Democrats. They\u2019re a sinister cabal who are about to tear up the constitution and remove the most powerful man in America, but also the whole thing - as stated by Hannity - is an \u201cunconstitutional clown show\u201d.\n\nThere are also messages dispensed to the Republican establishment - one evening\u2019s show ended with an ominous-sounding warning to Republicans on the impeachment process: \u201cYou must not take part.\u201d\n\nYet it\u2019s not just outrage offered, it\u2019s comfort. A bedtime story and glass of milk to right-of-centre voters worried about the torrent of negative headlines.\n\n\u201cThis will only strengthen the president going into 2020\u201d is a familiar refrain. It\u2019s often delivered with a dose of flattery to the audience; they know what\u2019s up. The elites don\u2019t. \u201cAmericans are extremely smart, they\u2019re very sophisticated,\u201d said Hannity one night. \u201cThey\u2019re smart enough to shop at Walmart and Costco and save money. People know the difference between an actual crime and a three-year witch hunt.\u201d\n\nThen there are the interviews that aren\u2019t really interviews.\n\nRudy Giuliani pops up one night, in which he\u2019s allowed to talk for up to three minutes at a time without any interruption or probing from Hannity.\n\n\u201cThe Salem witch trial,\u201d he claimed, \u201cwould be fairer than this.\u201d No pushback. \u201cIt\u2019s process without due process.\u201d\n\nWithout any interrogation, it turned into a sermon. Which was duly clipped up into bite-sized videos to tumble across social media.\n\nAt times, things get confusing. Monday saw the channel obsess over the China-NBA row. Most of their obsessions fit, in some way, into a culture war narrative between left and right, but it\u2019s hard to imagine many people on the mainstream left who\u2019d attempt to justify China\u2019s actions. Both Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson couldn\u2019t stop talking about it.\n\nIt was back to type on Tuesday, with Tucker launching into a monologue about \u2018woke capitalism\u2019. Brands polishing up their image with a bit of social responsibility was spoken of like a high crime or conspiracy. \u201cOnce corporate America flattered its customers,\u201d he opined, \u201cnow they dare you to be as virtuous as they are.\u201d\n\nA world view that sees enemies everywhere is presented nightly. Politicians, other nations, even your favourite brands want to bring you down.\n\nIt\u2019s Fox's powerful political support for Republicans that\u2019ll come into sharp focus as we head into 2020. And despite Mr Trump grumbling about Fox from time to time, they really do have his back.\n\nOn one day last week, Tucker popped up with the closest thing to the playground defence of \u201cI know you are but what am I?\u201d that I\u2019ve seen so far in US politics.\n\nHe offered up what he called his \u201cRosetta Stone of politics\u201d; that whatever the left accuses the right of doing, the left is already doing itself.\n\nIf you drill that into enough receptive brains, though, you\u2019ve got a go-to strategy on your hands that\u2019ll deflect every Democrat attack.\n\nBut the power of Fox isn\u2019t just its roster of paid stars, it's the ability to amplify the voices of figures in the Conservative sphere.\n\nThere\u2019s a fascinating ecosystem in existence, whereby fringe or forgotten figures on the right can get a reputation boost from Fox News appearances - boosting their exposure and social media profiles and continuing the spread of the message.\n\nThe powerful way in which this all connects together can be illustrated with the appearance of retired intelligence office John Kiriakou. He popped up on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show to talk about the whistleblower who triggered the recent Ukraine investigation into Mr Trump. (He also spent time behind bars for disclosing the identity of a fellow CIA officer.)\n\nMr Trump clearly watched it, tweeting a quote from Kiriakou saying the whistleblower was in fact a Democrat shill.\n\nKiriakou then quote-tweeted Trump to thank him for the tweet - adding: \u201cPlease pardon me!\u201d\n\nThe answer to all of this, though, is not to encourage friends and relatives who enjoy Fox News to give it up altogether, but to expand their sources of news. One source of news - whatever its slant - is dangerous, and left-of-centre news organisations can be just as myopic in their own obsessions with impeachment, whilst developing blind spots to the excesses of those seen to be on their side.\n\nInstead, broaden their horizons. Show them that Hannity is not the world. And that they need not go to bed every night fearing that America is filled with hidden enemies waiting to pounce.", "description": "One of the most startling things about Fox News is just how quickly it managed to embed itself in American culture.
