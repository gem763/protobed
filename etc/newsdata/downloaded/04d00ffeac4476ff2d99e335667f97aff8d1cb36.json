On Friday, Beijing announced a new round of retaliatory tariffs worth $75 billion, which will be imposed in two separate tranches on September 1 and December 15.\n\nTrump\u2019s tone was even more harsh than usual, asking whether Powell was worse for the economy than Chinese President Xi Jinping, with whom he\u2019s been sparring over bilateral trade.\n\n....My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s tweets sent major market benchmarks reeling, as investors anticipated a worsening of the crisis between the world\u2019s two largest economies. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) Dow (^DJI) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) all tumbled by over 1% in the wake of the president\u2019s tirade.\n\nChina is an integral part of the global supply chain and a vast market for most of America\u2019s multinationals. Many economists say that shifting production and finding alternative markets is far easier said than done.\n\nEven before the central bank cut rates for the first time since the 2008 crisis, the president has been lashing the Fed for not doing enough to prevent the economy from tipping into recession.\n\nIn recent weeks, he\u2019s taken to complaining about the dollar\u2019s relative strength \u2014 which has jumped amid safe-haven flows during the U.S.-China trade spat.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs usual, the Fed did NOTHING! It is incredible that they can \u201cspeak\u201d without knowing or asking what I am doing, which will be announced shortly. We have a very strong dollar and a very weak Fed. I will work \u201cbrilliantly\u201d with both, and the U.S. will do great... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, comments from the Fed\u2019s Open Market Committee (FOMC) members and other policymakers underscore the lack of consensus about how aggressively the central bank should be in cutting rates, if at all.\n\n\"As the minutes from the July FOMC meeting indicated, the nation\u2019s central bankers were divided on the question how exactly to proceed while settling on the quarter-point rate reduction,\u201d said Bankrate.com\u2019s senior economic analyst, Mark Hamrick.\n\n\u201cPowell emphasized in his speech that there\u2019s no playbook here noting as he put it 'no recent precedents to guide any policy response to the current situation.' And that\u2019s to say nothing of the president\u2019s actions which have included imposing tariffs and delivering an almost daily barrage of verbal criticism of Powell,\u201d Hamrick added.\n\nJavier David is an editor for Yahoo Finance.
