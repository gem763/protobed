Certain versions of the app mimic Alexa or Google Assistant, pretending to offer a software update and asking users to input their password.\n\nAll eight of the apps passed Amazon or Google security checks, meaning they could have been made available for public download on either platform, according to the researchers.\n\n\"Customer trust is important to us, and we conduct security reviews as part of the skill certification process,\" an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider. \"We quickly blocked the skill in question and put mitigations in place to prevent and detect this type of skill behavior and reject or take them down when identified. It's also important that customers know we provide automatic security updates for our devices, and will never ask them to share their password.\"\n\nA Google spokesperson told Business Insider that the company is taking steps to prevent similar issues going forward.\n\n\"All Actions on Google are required to follow our developer policies, and we prohibit and remove any Action that violates these policies. We have review processes to detect the type of behavior described in this report, and we removed the Actions that we found from these researchers. We are putting additional mechanisms in place to prevent these issues from occurring in the future,\" the Google spokesperson said.\n\nHere's how the apps work: First, they gave users the expected message \u2014 either a randomly generated number or a brief horoscope. Next, the apps go silent, giving users the impression that the software has closed, while still listening to conversations and sending a copy of transcripts to a third-party server.\n\nThe malicious apps can also impersonate Alexa or Google Home to ask users for sensitive information. As demonstrated in the videos below, the apps give the impression that the software has closed, then impersonate Alexa to prompt users to input their password to download a software update.\n\nThe researchers have already taken the apps offline and said they have privately reported their findings to Google and Amazon.", "description": "A group of whitehat hackers have demonstrated that third-party apps on Google Home or Alexa can log users' conversations and phish for passwords.", "authors": ["Aaron Holmes"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5dadbc104af90901e729c083?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
