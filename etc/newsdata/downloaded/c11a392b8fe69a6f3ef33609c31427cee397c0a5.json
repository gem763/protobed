Will he be able to make friends? Get a job? What will be his quality of life?'\"\n\nIn an effort to help their child, Ziemba and her husband purportedly enrolled him in a program at a school that teaches communication and socialization skills. Three months later, however, they received troubling news. Doctors had discovered that Simon also had B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia \u2014 a common type of cancer among children that starts in the bone marrow.\n\n\"I remember thinking, 'This is so unfair; he was just diagnosed with autism,'\" his mother said. \"How can one little kid have to fight both of these? He wasn't even 3 years old.\"\n\nAs a result of his diagnosis, Simon had two surgeries \u2014 one for an emergency blood transfusion and another to insert a chemotherapy port. He also underwent several rounds of chemotherapy, the clinic notes.\n\nTo the surprise of both his parents and doctors, the child's cancer went into remission in just 28 days. For the past couple of years, he has been cancer-free. He has also made significant progress at his school, his mother said.\n\n\"The progress he's made is astounding,\" Ziemba said. \"We still have a long way to go, but we're all just amazed by him.\"\n\nUltimately, Simon's mother said she just wants her son to live a fulfilling life.\n\n\"Our goal is for Simon to live his best life, and be his best self,\" she said. \"And every milestone he achieves is such a wonderful gift \u2013 one that he has worked so hard to make happen. We\u2019'e so proud of him \u2013 actually, pride doesn't cover it \u2013 we\u2019re just in awe.\"", "description": "A 4-year-old boy who was diagnosed with autism and cancer within three months has impressively beaten the odds", "authors": ["Justin Chan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9IfEvCLcwfis1yiEUR7uLQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/6022x3947+0+58/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/3b705ac0-dbea-11e9-afed-0d363e08fb88", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
