The thought of this haunts me.\n\n\u2018I cannot bear the thought of Ravi being in pain and then dying there, where he was attacked, on the floor of the shop.\n\nGunn was described in court as a \u2018one-man crimewave\u2019 (Picture: PA)\n\nMr Katharkamar was described as a \u2018kind, humorous and loving\u2019 family man (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018I hate the fact he was alone, that I was not there to hold or comfort him, tend to his wounds or tell him I loved him and that all would be OK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018No, he died alone with no-one around him.\n\n\u2018I constantly wonder if the man who did this will ever realise or care that he has left such a huge trail of devastation within my family.\u2019\n\nMs Aiyathirai said her husband had been \u2018defenceless against a violent man who thought nothing of using a knife\u2019.\n\nJurors were told CCTV footage showed Gunn holding a knife to Mr Katharkamar\u2019s throat and grappling with him before plunging the blade into his chest.\n\nGunn left him there, grabbing the till and fleeing in a stolen black Vauxhall Astra.\n\nA jogger found the shopkeeper collapsed in the doorway and called the emergency services who pronounced him dead at the scene shortly after arriving.\n\nHe had suffered two knife wounds, one of which fractured a rib and punctured his lung and heart.\n\nGunn crept up on Mr Katharkamar from behind as he set out the Sunday newspapers (Picture: Central News)\n\nHe stabbed the shopkeeper in the heart and fled in a stolen Vauxhall Astra (Picture: Central News)\n\nDespite covering up in a balaclava and gloves, his build and movements gave Gunn away (Picture: PA)\n\nThe court heard Gunn paid two earlier visits to the store, including one the previous week timed almost to the minute.\n\nWhen he was arrested in the Astra five days after the fatal robbery he had changed the number plates in an effort to avoid detection.\n\nProsecutor William Emlyn Jones said Gunn was \u2018sufficiently savvy\u2019 to have covered himself up with a balaclava and gloves during the raid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut jurors heard his build and movements along with security footage proved to be his undoing.\n\nMr Emlyn Jones described the killer as a \u2018one-man crimewave\u2019 who had also carried out a series of burglaries and thefts to fund his drug habit.\n\nGunn, from Pinner, was convicted of murder, robbery, four burglaries, three thefts and two counts of possession of a bladed article and will be sentenced on Friday.\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Simon Stancombe, of Scotland Yard, said: \u2018Ravi Katharkamar and Alex Gunn couldn\u2019t be more different.\n\n\u2018Ravi was a warm and loving father and husband. A man who worked long hours to support his young family and run his shop in the heart of the local community in Pinner.\n\n\u2018Alex Gunn, on the other hand, is a career criminal who has spent much of his adult life preying on other people.\n\n\u2018Alex Gunn is an odious, vile and dangerous individual who I am pleased to say will now be in prison for a very long time.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
