Some of us are experts on juvenile justice; some of us are disability experts. Some of us are academics who study miscarriages of justice in Wisconsin and abroad. Some of us are exonerees who have ourselves been convicted of crimes we did not commit and who were later cleared by DNA evidence. Still others simply wish to lend our names and voices in support of Brendan.\u201d\n\nThe letter continued: \u201cMany of us believe Brendan Dassey to be wrongly convicted and his statements, which constitute the primary evidence against him, to be unreliable. Many of us believe that the process that led to the conviction of this sixteen-year-old special education student was indefensibly flawed, characterized by egregious defense attorney misconduct. And many of us believe that Brendan\u2019s sentence \u2013 life in prison, with no chance of parole until 2048 \u2013 is wildly inappropriate. All of us agree that, after serving more than thirteen years in prison and accumulating an exemplary prison record, it is time to bring Brendan Dassey home.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Making a Murderer' Subject Brendan Dassey Seeking Clemency After 13 Years in Prison\n\nEarlier this month, Dassey\u2019s legal team launched a campaign to persuade the governor of Wisconsin Tony Evers to grant him clemency. According to the petition, Dassey is either asking for a pardon, which would result in his release from prison, or a commutation of his remaining sentence. This is one of the last remaining legal options available to Dassey.\n\nDassey was 16 when he confessed to aiding his uncle Steven Avery in killing Halbach. However, his attorneys have since seen it as a coerced confession given Dassey\u2019s learning disabilities. At the time of the interrogation, no lawyers or other adults were present. The Netflix series \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d chronicled the trials and convictions of both him and his uncle, Steven Avery.\n\nIn December 2018, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided that Dassey\u2019s confession was voluntary. It was a tight vote, however, with a 4-3 outcome. Lower courts ruled that Dassey\u2019s confession was involuntary. In June of last year, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear his case, but no reason was given. Dassey is currently serving a life sentence. At this time, Dassey is not eligible for parole until 2048, when he would be 59 years old.\n\nAlso Read: 'Making a Murderer:' Kathleen Zellner Asks for New Trial for Steven Avery in Wisconsin\n\nAvery was also found guilty in Halbach\u2019s 2007 murder.
