Not to mention the wild success of Fenty beauty. However, as the November cover star for Vogue, she\u2019s revealed plenty of information about her personal beliefs, her political stance, and her upcoming projects \u2014 including her much anticipated new album.\n\n\n\nShe\u2019d wear every piece in her Fenty collection\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the face of my brand, but I am the muse, and my DNA has to run all the way through it,\u201d she tells Vogue. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to pull up my website and think, Rihanna would never wear that.\u201d\n\nShe is in fact dating rumored boyfriend Hassan Jameel\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m dating,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m actually in an exclusive relationship for quite some time, and it\u2019s going really well, so I\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\nAnd she wants kids\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt.\u201d\n\nShe turned down the Super Bowl halftime show in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t dare do that. For what? Who gains from that? Not my people. I just couldn\u2019t be a sellout. I couldn\u2019t be an enabler. There\u2019s things within that organization that I do not agree with at all, and I was not about to go and be of service to them in any way.\u201d\n\nShe makes the personal political\n\n\u201cWhen a journalist tweeted that Rihanna\u2019s \u2018Don\u2019t Stop the Music\u2019 was blaring at a Trump rally last year, Rihanna replied, \u2018Not for much longer. . . .\u2019 I especially relished her response when, under a post encouraging her followers to vote in the midterms, someone asked, \u2018Are you even a US citizen? Honest curiosity.\u2019 Rihanna: \u2018Nah I\u2019m an immigrant tryna get yo country together. Did u vote?\u2019\u201d\n\nThough she\u2019s hopeful for the future\n\n\u201cI feel like the darkness has actually forced people to find this light within them where they want to do better,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy when you think everything is going really well and perfect. When everything is flowers and butterflies and you\u2019re in your own bubble and your own world. But to see it, to know it\u2019s happening\u2014it pushes you to want to be the light in the world.\u201d\n\nEven Mary J. Blige thinks she\u2019s the best\n\n\u201cRihanna is the truth,\u201d Blige says. \u201cReal and true to the game.\u201d\n\nHer next album will be reggae inspired\n\n\u201cI like to look at it as a reggae-inspired or reggae-infused album. It\u2019s not gonna be typical of what you know as reggae. But you\u2019re going to feel the elements in all of the tracks,\u201d Rihanna explains. \u201cReggae always feels right to me. It\u2019s in my blood. It doesn\u2019t matter how far or long removed I am from that culture, or my environment that I grew up in; it never leaves. It\u2019s always the same high. Even though I\u2019ve explored other genres of music, it was time to go back to something that I haven\u2019t really homed in on completely for a body of work.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, when asked about the release date she didn\u2019t have an answer\n\n\u201cNo, oh my God, they\u2019re gonna kill you for that!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cAnd they\u2019re going to kill me more!\u201d\n\nBUT it\u2019s happening\n\n\u201cMusic is, like, speaking in code to the world, where they get it. It\u2019s the weird language that connects me to them. Me the designer, me the woman who creates makeup and lingerie\u2014it all started with music. It was my first pen pal\u2013ship to the world. To cut that off is to cut my communication off. All of these other things flourish on top of that foundation.\u201d\n\nAnd she\u2019s already at work on the tenth album\n\n\u201cOne was gonna be inspired by the music that I grew up listening to. And one was gonna be the evolution of where I\u2019m going next with music.\u201d", "description": "Including all the details on her 'reggae-inspired' ninth album.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9e2fb499d7c90009cb3586/lede/1570650555382-GettyImages-1167781773.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.862xh;0xw,0.0603xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
