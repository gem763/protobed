He also had a good, constructive meeting with President Trump at the White House today,\u201d Facebook spokesman Daniel Roberts told HuffPost.\n\nJared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, and Dan Scavino, the president\u2019s social media director, also attended the meeting, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Thursday evening, Trump posted a picture of himself with Zuckerberg in the Oval Office.\n\nThis appears to be the first time the Facebook CEO has met with the president, although BuzzFeed News reported in July 2018 that Zuckerberg had secretly called Trump after the 2016 election to congratulate him.\n\nFacebook did not comment on the impetus for Thursday\u2019s meeting. But Zuckerberg was in the nation\u2019s capital this week to address lawmakers\u2019 concerns over Facebook\u2019s business practices, including how it protects privacy and user data and how it attempts to curb the spread of misinformation.\n\nAt a private dinner on Wednesday evening, Zuckerberg reportedly told a group of top Senate Democrats that the Libra Association, the entity managing the company\u2019s new cryptocurrency, wouldn\u2019t move forward without regulatory approval. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who organized the dinner, told The Washington Post on Thursday that Zuckerberg said Libra \u201cwould not be launching its product without the buy-in from U.S. regulators.\u201d\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) also met with Zuckerberg over Facebook\u2019s efforts to safeguard user data.\n\n\u201cI said to him, \u2018Prove that you are serious about data \u2015 sell WhatsApp and sell Instagram.\u2019 That\u2019s what they should do,\u201d Hawley said, according to Bloomberg. \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say he was not receptive to those suggestions.\u201d\n\nThe meetings came amid increasing federal and state scrutiny of tech companies like Facebook and Google.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James (D) launched a multistate investigation into possible antitrust violations by Facebook earlier this month. Days later, 48 state attorneys general, plus their counterparts in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, announced a similar probe of Google. Facebook agreed to pay a record $5 billion fine to the Federal Trade Commission in July over allegations that it committed privacy violations in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.", "description": "The Facebook CEO and the president had a \"constructive\" meeting, the social media giant said.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d841b8f2100005b00e44478.jpeg?cache=lv8qousder&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
