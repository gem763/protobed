(AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Monday upheld a Virginia law requiring women to undergo an ultrasound and wait at least 24 hours before having an abortion, as well as the state\u2019s \u201cphysician-only law\u201d barring nurse practitioners and physician\u2019s assistants from performing abortions.\n\nThe ruling by U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson came in a lawsuit that challenged four Virginia laws that opponents say restrict access to abortion in the state.\n\nHudson overturned two state laws, including one requiring all second-trimester abortions to be performed at a licensed outpatient hospital and regulations that would have required clinics that provide first-trimester abortions to meet the same facility requirements as general and surgical hospitals.\n\nThe lawsuit was one of more than a dozen filed around the country challenging what abortion-rights groups call TRAP laws \u2014 Targeted Restrictions on Abortion Providers. A trial in Richmond, the state capital, began in May as the abortion debate exploded nationwide. Several states had passed strict new laws limiting abortions, including Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Ohio and Kentucky.\n\nWomen\u2019s reproductive rights groups that brought the lawsuit expressed disappointment with the mixed ruling.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed that our patients did not get their constitutionally-protected right to accessing healthcare without legislative interference, which they are entitled to and they deserve,\u201d said a statement from Rosemary Codding, the founder and director of the Falls Church Healthcare Center.\n\nAmy Hagstrom Miller, president and chief executive officer of Whole Woman\u2019s Health Alliance, said the group is pleased that the court relaxed state restrictions on second-trimester abortion care, but disappointed that the judge \u201cdid not see clearly how the other restrictions it left in force are not supported by medical evidence and place undue burdens on families (in) the Commonwealth.\u201d\n\nDuring the trial, the plaintiffs opted to have a judge decide the case instead of a jury. A lawyer for the women\u2019s health groups argued that the regulations are overly restrictive and put up unnecessary barriers to women seeking abortions.\n\nDr. Mark Nichols, an obstetrician/gynecologist who worked for years as the medical director of a Planned Parenthood chapter in Oregon, testified that the laws being challenged in Virginia add layers of regulation that are not medically necessary.\n\nThe state, however, argued that the laws have made abortion clinics safer and have not placed an undue burden on women seeking abortions.\n\n\u201cInconvenience is not an unconstitutional burden,\u201d said Emily Munro Scott, an attorney representing the state.\n\nIn his ruling upholding Virginia\u2019s physician-only law, Hudson cited a long line of U.S. Supreme Court rulings upholding the right of states to determine what medical procedures should be performed by physicians. He said the evidence presented during the trial \u201chas not shown that such a restriction has caused an undue burden on a significant number of women seeking abortion care.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, the Court cannot conclude that the Physician-Only law, as it applies to first trimester abortion procedures, is unconstitutional,\u201d Hudson wrote. \u201cWhether it is wise public policy is an issue for the Virginia General Assembly to address.\u201d\n\nIn upholding the state\u2019s \u201cinformed consent law,\u201d Hudson said the main challenge from reproductive rights groups was the law\u2019s requirement that a woman receive an ultrasound at least 24 hours before getting an abortion. The groups referred to the requirement as the \u201ctwo-trip mandatory delay law\u201d because it requires women to make two trips to a clinic, one for the ultrasound and a second for the abortion procedure.\n\nHudson, while acknowledging that the law \u201cposes additional burdens, particularly with respect to poor and low-income individuals,\u201d said the evidence \u201cis insufficient for the Court to conclude that it amounts to a substantial obstacle to abortion access.\u201d", "description": "The ruling upheld a Virginia law requiring women to undergo an ultrasound and wait at least 24 hours before having an abortion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d92cc50210000510050db54.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
