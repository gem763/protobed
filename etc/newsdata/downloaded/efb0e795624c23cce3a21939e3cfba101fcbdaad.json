You were the one running behind her.\"\n\nNaidu instead alleged that Pillay knew she was having a period because he had tried to have sex with her before he killed her.\n\n\"But you saw that she had a sanitary pad [on] and that you could not. That is why you have been so sure. The truth is Jane had found someone else and didn't want anything to do with you.\"\n\nReplying, Pillay frantically said: \"No, I am telling you that Jane told me.\"\n\n'After she was punched, you strangled her'\n\nPillay was visibly nervous when Naidu used physical evidence to implicate him.\n\nShe said that the injuries police had viewed on him just after the incident were consistent with the injuries to all three women.\n\n\"The cut on your hand has the same serrated edge as Jane's. The knife was broken and she had a cut consistent with a struggle.\"\n\nNaidu said that scratch marks on Pillay's hands were consistent with long nails that both daughters had.\n\n\"Jane may not have had long nails, but the girls certainly did. This is also the reason why you ended up at a garage shop after the murders. You bought plasters after you left the crime scene.\"\n\nNaidu further alleged that Pillay had punched Rackelle, who may have walked in on him killing her sister.\n\n\"You punched Rackelle and the evidence shows she was punched. There was a witness who heard a scream coming from the direction of the home on the day in question. After she was punched, you strangled her, that is why you have her DNA on your hand.\"\n\nThe matter continues on Friday.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
