In this World Series, that includes the Nationals, even though they swept Beal\u2019s Cardinals in the National League Championship Series to reach the Fall Classic.\n\nBeal said he watched the Nationals\u2019 Game 6 win over the Houston Astros that tied the World Series 3-3, and he spoke affectionately of budding superstar Juan Soto.\n\n\u201cI love him, man,\u201d Beal told reporters at Wednesday\u2019s shootaround. \u201cI love everything he do. I love him carrying that bat to first base, everything. If they\u2019re going to do that, you return the favor. You smack that (expletive) out the park and then you drop that bat right at first base.\u201d\n\nBeal was referring to Soto\u2019s home run in the fifth inning of Game 6, in which he carried his bat all the way to first base before dropping it in a celebratory manner. Soto was copying what Astros star Alex Bregman did in the first inning of the same game.\n\nSoto later said he simply thought what Bregman did was \u201ccool\u201d and he wanted to try it, too. Both Washington manager Dave Martinez and Houston manager A.J. Hinch were unhappy their players celebrated like that, though, implying it was disrespectful.\n\nBeal was on Soto\u2019s side, saying it was just a natural part of sports.\n\n\u201cBaseball, I think they\u2019re not able to express themselves, right?\u201d Beal said. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s weird \u2026 It\u2019s definitely tough because you can agree with a lot of, like you said, balls and strikes and things of that nature. You can\u2019t really celebrate and taunt like you want to. It sucks, but that\u2019s why I play basketball.\u201d\n\nThe Wizards\u2019 home opener is Wednesday \u2014 against the Houston Rockets, scheduled for the same time Washington and Houston will face off in Game 7 of the World Series.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
