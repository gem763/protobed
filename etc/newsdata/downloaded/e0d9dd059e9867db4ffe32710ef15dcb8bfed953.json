You may need to make sure the credit report is accurate and take stock of any creditors you need to notify of the death, or see if there\u2019s any unresolved debt that you\u2019re not aware of.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for criminals to try to take advantage of the fact that someone who has died isn\u2019t checking their credit, which can increase the chances of identity theft and credit card fraud. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial to handle this process as quickly as possible.\n\nObtaining someone else\u2019s credit report\n\nIn general, only the person who is the subject of the credit report should have access to it. But there are times when you may need to pull someone else\u2019s report, such as the death of a loved one. Other instances may be when you\u2019re checking someone\u2019s credit as part of an application for a job or a rental property or if you\u2019re helping someone work on their credit. Here are some commonly asked questions about obtaining someone else\u2019s report.\n\nHow do you check someone\u2019s credit history? You must have permission to check someone\u2019s credit history, which can be as simple as them checking a box on a rental or job application. Once you have their permission, you can use their Social Security number, name and date of birth to do a background check that includes a credit history.\n\nYou must have permission to check someone\u2019s credit history, which can be as simple as them checking a box on a rental or job application.

This is common in situations where an agency or individual is helping another person repair their credit or address inaccuracies after identity theft. Should you notify credit bureaus of a death? Yes, you should notify the three major credit bureaus as soon as possible after a death to ensure that the account is marked as deceased and no one else can open credit in the person\u2019s name.\n\nObtaining the credit report of the dead\n\nOne of the most common situations where you will need to obtain someone else\u2019s credit report is if a loved one dies and you are the financial power of attorney and/or executor of the estate. Here are the steps you need to take to obtain your loved one\u2019s credit report after they\u2019ve died and how to protect their legacy.\n\n1. Collect all the paperwork\n\nIt\u2019s a lot easier to begin the process of obtaining a credit report if you already have the paperwork needed. Each of the three different credit bureaus may have different requirements to be able to report someone dead and obtain their report, so you may want to call and find out what documents are required beforehand. The most commonly requested are:\n\nA copy of the durable financial power of attorney, if applicable\n\nProof that you have been named executor of the estate\n\nTestamentary letters from the probate court\n\nAn official copy of the death certificate\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to get at least one copy of these documents for each of the three bureaus, but you\u2019ll also probably want a copy for yourself and another backup just in case.\n\n5 key tax questions when you\u2019re responsible for a loved one\u2019s estate\n\n2. File the will if necessary\n\nBefore you can start the process of obtaining the credit report, you\u2019ll need to file the will with the probate court. To do this, you\u2019ll need a certified copy of the death certificate, which can be obtained from your local health department for a small fee. If there is no will or named executor of the estate, you may need to file with the courts to be named as executor.\n\n3. Submit a death certificate and other documents to the credit agencies\n\nOnce you have all of your documents gathered together, you\u2019re ready to start submitting the paperwork to the credit bureaus. Remember that you\u2019ll need to report the death and ask for the report from all three major bureaus: Experian, EXPGY, +1.37% TransUnion TRU, +0.31% and Equifax. EFX, +0.55% Along with the death certificate, power of attorney and testamentary letters, you\u2019ll also need to include a cover letter explaining that the person has passed and that you need to obtain the reports to put their affairs in order. Your letter should also include:\n\nThe deceased\u2019s name\n\nLast used mailing address\n\nSocial Security number\n\nYou may also need to send along a check or pay via phone or online to obtain the report, depending on the bureau\u2019s policies and how recently the credit report was last obtained.\n\n4. Review the credit report\n\nGo through the credit report thoroughly checking for any inaccuracies\u2014name and address misspellings are common\u2014and make note of any open accounts that need to be paid with the estate or notified of the death. It\u2019s a common misconception that all debts are automatically cleared when a person dies, but this isn\u2019t the case, so it\u2019s important to know what will still need to be taken care of. Make sure to be on the lookout for anything unusual\u2013it could be a sign of suspicious activity.\n\n5. Update any creditors and the Social Security Administration\n\nThe last step is to update the credit bureaus, any outstanding creditors and the Social Security Administration of the death. You may be asking, \u201cWhat happens to your credit report when you die?\u201d Until the credit bureaus are notified that a death has occurred, nothing happens to the credit report. Once the proper documentation has been submitted and the request made, the bureaus will mark the account as deceased.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: My dying friend wants to marry me so I can have his Social Security \u2014 should I do it?\n\nThis means that no further credit will be extended in the person\u2019s name and no additional accounts can be opened up, which helps protect against identity theft and credit card fraud. The death certificate should be all that\u2019s needed to complete this step.", "description": "If someone close to you dies, you may need to wrap up a few loose ends with regard to their credit.", "authors": ["Gerri Detweiler"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ483_cr_dea_MG_20190830111913.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
