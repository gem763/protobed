(Stock image)\n\nMy GP has told me that he would be willing to provide evidence of sickness and ill health but I am having great difficulty finding who and where to send these notes and evidence to.\n\nI have tried every phone number I can find only to be disconnected or stuck in a loop not being able to state which benefit I require.\n\nI am not a benefit claimer. Since finishing work my husband has supported me so I have no record at a job centre and having contacted them by phone they told me they could do nothing for me.\n\nI would therefore be extremely grateful if you could help or at least point me in the right direction.\n\nSCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK YOUR PENSION QUESTION\n\nSteve Webb replies: As you are aware, even for years when you didn't actually pay National Insurance Contributions (NICs) you can still be 'credited' in to the system in certain circumstances, and this helps to protect your state pension record.\n\nUnfortunately, simply being signed off work by your GP is not enough on its own to trigger entitlement to credits.\n\nSteve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below\n\nThe way that National Insurance credits work for those who are unable to contribute because of unemployment or sickness is that they are triggered by qualifying for the relevant National Insurance benefit.\n\nFor example, people who are unemployed and are entitled to Jobseekers Allowance (JSA) or who are off sick and entitled to Employment Support Allowance (ESA) automatically get credits towards their state pension.\n\nFocusing on ESA, there are two version of this benefit \u2013 'contributory' ESA for those with a recent record of paying NICs, and 'income-based' ESA for those with a low household income.\n\nIt sounds as though you would not qualify for either of these.\n\nYou probably would not get 'contributory' ESA because of your lack of recent NI contributions, and I'm assuming you would not get 'income-based' ESA because of your husband's income.\n\nHowever, there is a third route and this is called 'credits only'. What you would need to do is claim ESA, even though you know you will not get weekly benefit.\n\nAs long as you satisfy the other tests (eg satisfying them that you are not fit for work) then you should qualify for credits towards your state pension. Hundreds of thousands of people are in exactly this position.\n\nThere are however strict time limits on claims, so if you make one now the most it could be backdated by is three months.\n\nYou should be aware however that if you do put in a claim for 'credits only' ESA, you still have to jump through all the same hoops as other claimants who do get weekly benefit, including attending periodic medical assessments.\n\nIf you do not wish to do this then your main option to protect your state pension would be to consider making voluntary NI contributions.\n\nIf you and your husband have some savings then these could be used to top up your NI record.\n\nA year of voluntary contributions currently costs a lump sum of \u00a3780, and this would boost your final state pension by around \u00a3250 per year, assuming you would not otherwise get a full state pension. I have written a guide to state pension top-ups which you can find here.\n\nI have assumed throughout that you were not receiving child benefit for a child under 12 in any of the years that we are talking about.\n\nIf you were, then the good news is that you automatically get NI credits for those years.", "description": "I left the NHS five and half years ago and was allowed to claim my NHS pension early at 50.
