Former vice president Joe Biden has now come out in support of conviction for the first time and the president and his allies are firing back at Biden and the whistle-blower. Cecilia Vega tracking it all from the white house, good morning, Cecilia. Reporter: George, good morning to you. The president is firing back and this morning so is that whistle-blower as you said in the face of those relentless attacks from president trump and his allies. The whistle-blower's lawyers until now had been reluctant to release any information about their client's identity. Not anymore. This morning, lawyers for the whistle-blower say the anonymous government employee has spent an entire career working nonpartisan jobs in the executive branch and they say, quote, our client has never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign or party. The whistle-blower only coming into contact with presidential candidates in their roles as elected officials, candidates from both parties. This is a con job. Reporter: It happened after president trump launched a smear job claiming he worked for one of his democratic referrals. It turns out the whistle-blower is a Democrat, strong Democrat and is working with one of my opponents as a Democrat that I might end up running against. The whole thing is a scam. Reporter: The whistle-blower's lawyer saying the whistle-blower is not the story. To date virtually every substantive allegation has been confirmed by other sources. For that reason the identity of the whistle-blower is irrelevant. One of those rivals, former vice president Joe Biden, for the first time said the president should be impeached. To preserve our constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached. Reporter: President trump firing right back. Biden is dropping like a rock. I don't think he's going to make it. Reporter: Well, the white house is now in full force gearing up for this impeachment battle. They have brought on former congressman trey Gowdy to the president's outside legal team. You will remember that he led the Republican investigation into Benghazi joining, of course, a team refusing to cooperate with congress' investigation into this impeachment. The irony here, George, during Benghazi he was adamant that the Obama administration had no choice but to cooperate with congress. Cecilia Vega, thanks very much.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "A new poll from Fox News shows 51% of Americans support removing President Trump from office as Trump and his allies push back against Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/191010_gma_vega2_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
