REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nPence told a packed audience at the Heritage Foundation think tank that passage of USMCA would create jobs and trigger increased investment in the United States, while helping President Donald Trump reach a trade deal with China.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep fighting to get the USMCA across the line. I believe we can get it done this year,\u201d Pence said.\n\nThe Trump administration has been pressing for swift approval of the trade deal. But House Democrats say they want better mechanisms to enforce labor and environmental standards, and to ensure that the deal does not lead to higher drug prices for U.S. consumers.\n\nCNBC said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told the network in an interview to air later on Tuesday that Democrats aim to get to a place where they can ratify the trade deal, but still have concerns about enforcing it.\n\n\u201cWe hope that we\u2019re on a path to \u2018Yes.\u2019 The most important issue outstanding is enforceability,\u201d she told CNBC.\n\nPence said speedy passage of the agreement would help Washington deal more effectively with China. \u201cBy bringing North America together ... it will only strengthen the president\u2019s hand as we demand that China end the trade abuses that have characterized the decades of the past,\u201d he said.\n\nPence said the USMCA was \u201cso advanced and so comprehensive\u201d that it could serve as a template for future trade agreements with Britain, the European Union, Japan, or \u201ceven China.\u201d\n\nMartha Barcena, Mexican ambassador to the United States, said she hoped Congress would pass the trade accord this year. She said Mexico, whose parliament has already approved the agreement, was seeking to inform U.S. lawmakers about its newly enacted labor reforms and how they were being funded.\n\nShe told Reuters after Pence\u2019s speech that Mexico did not view changes in the text of the agreement as necessary.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need changes in the text of the USMCA. We think they can be solved with the current text, and with parallel agreements,\u201d she said.\n\nCanada\u2019s acting envoy to the United States, Kirsten Hillman, said she was optimistic the measure would pass Congress.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s enough will there, and it\u2019s still early enough that it can probably move along. We\u2019re hearing good things so we\u2019re optimistic,\u201d she said.\n\nCanada will wait to approve the agreement until after its Oct. 21 election, she said, echoing Mexico\u2019s reluctance to reopen the trade agreement.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the deal we signed. That\u2019s the one that we have started to move through our house,\u201d she said.", "description": "U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday said he believed Congress would act to pass a new U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement this year, providing important momentum for the U.S. economy.", "authors": ["Andrea Shalal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430956523&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1O0-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
