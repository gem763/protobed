The health agency is hoping to shed light on the issue by launching a campaign in solidarity with patients on the first-ever World Patient Safety Day on September 17.\n\n\"No one should be harmed while receiving health care.

Here's how much their coworkers at hospitals make\n\nAccording to the report, four out of 10 patients suffer harm during primary care and outpatient treatment.

The cost of prescribing the wrong medication alone is $42 billion a year.\n\n\"We need a patient safety culture that promotes partnership with patients, encourages reporting and learning from errors, and creates a blame-free environment where health workers are empowered and trained to reduce errors,\" said Ghebreyesus.\n\nRead more: 5G is being used to perform remote surgery from thousands of miles away, and it could transform the healthcare industry\n\nAdditionally, unsafe surgical procedures result in 1 million deaths during or immediately after surgery every year.
