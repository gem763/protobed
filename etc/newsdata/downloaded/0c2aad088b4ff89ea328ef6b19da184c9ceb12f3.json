REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\n\n(Reuters) - U.S. budget carrier Spirit Airlines (SAVE.N) is close to agreeing a provisional deal to order as many as 100 single-aisle aircraft worth up to $12 billion at recent catalogue prices from Airbus (AIR.PA), industry sources said.\n\nSuch a deal would be the first for the European planemaker since the United States imposed 10% tariffs on some of the planes it offers to U.S. carriers last week, as part of a long-running transatlantic trade dispute over aircraft subsidies.\n\nAirbus declined comment. Spirit, which reports earnings later on Wednesday, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA deal of that size would be worth up to $12 billion at the most recent 2018 Airbus list prices, but industry sources say such deals typically involve discounts of at least 50%.", "description": "U.S. budget carrier Spirit Airlines is close to agreeing a provisional deal to order as many as 100 single-aisle aircraft worth up to $12 billion at recent catalogue prices from Airbus , industry sources said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444144402&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1DK", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
