Odle\u2019s The Clockwork Man. Is it a serious work of science fiction or slapstick?\n\nThe MacArthur \u201cGenius\u201d Grant winners have been announced.\n\nThe modern university has destroyed old-school college presidencies, and that\u2019s not a good thing, argue Naomi Schaefer Riley and James Piereson: \u201cThe president of a major college and university today is unlikely to be the bookish professor steeped in the ideals of the academy, but the modern manager skilled in raising funds, placating advocacy groups on campus and off, and tending to his or her own career. It is hard to imagine that these leaders would have the time, let alone the inclination, to set forth any kind of grand academic vision for their school. And given their short tenures and the professional risks they face, why should today\u2019s college presidents bother to stand up against any assault on the university from any of its various constituencies? We don\u2019t need to throw a pity party for the folks who decide to lead colleges and universities today. But if you want to know why it seems like the job, even with such high salaries, is not attracting better candidates, or any kind of long-term commitment, these changes are a good place to start.\u201d The key word here is \u201cunlikely,\u201d because there are presidents who do set a \u201cgrand academic vision.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Lowry reviews Ann Patchett\u2019s The Dutch House: \u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that Maeve has \u2018a stack of Henry James novels on her bedside table\u2019 \u2013 among them The Turn of the Screw. An obsessive younger woman who comes to a big house and falls for the aloof owner? Check. Lost mother? Check. Terrorised children? Check. Stalwart and sceptical housekeeper? Check. \u2018Lots of ghosts\u2019 (as Danny puts it)? Check that, too. If The Dutch House is like a novel by James, however, then it\u2019s most like The Spoils of Poynton, cleverly appropriating that book\u2019s use of a coveted house and its treasures as an index to human character.\u201d\n\nGary J. Schmitt argues over at The American Interest that \u201cbecause the Constitution seems to have created a relatively open door when it comes impeachment, a plausible assumption is that impeachment, qua impeachment, was never meant to be such an exceptional oversight mechanism. Just as it is plausible to argue that removal would be rare.\u201d\n\nEssay of the Day:\n\nJason Guriel, one of the best poetry critics working today, writes about that nebulous thing called the prose poem:\n\n\u201cPoetry, said W. H. Auden, is \u2018memorable speech.\u2019 It\u2019s a reasonable definition: broad enough to include a lot of flora and fauna, but strict enough to put up fencing. You should be able to say a poem, and your head should want to hold on to it. Rhyme and meter can help with this. So, too, can a vivid image. \u2018The stars are not wanted now; put out every one. / Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun.\u2019 That\u2019s Auden, and just try to forget it.\n\n\u201cThere are always outliers, of course\u2014\u2019concrete poems,\u2019 where clusters of words are shunted into shapes and pictures, or \u2018sound poems,\u2019 where a poet uses their voice to honk out patterns of noise. But most civilians know a poem when they see one. A poem strikes us as inevitable: it can be no other way, employ no other words. This is an illusion, of course, but the poem pulls it off because it\u2019s already pressed itself upon our memories. Auden\u2019s every move\u2014the way the sound of \u2018pack\u2019 pays off \u2018put\u2019; the way the stock cosmic props are redeemed by the strangeness of \u2018dismantle\u2019\u2014lays down ruts in the mind. We\u2019re duly reassured we\u2019re dealing with the real thing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the insiders\u2014the poets, the tenured\u2014who like to \u2018problematize\u2019 poetry and wield their whatabouts. The \u2018prose poem\u2019 is one of the most abiding whatabouts. It remains an outlier, a problem. \u2018A prose poem is a poem without line breaks,\u2019 writes Jeremy Noel-Tod in the introduction to his recent anthology, The Penguin Book of the Prose Poem. Blame the French, who revel in unravelling categories. Aloysius Bertrand, in the nineteenth century, was the first to compose a block of text and call it poetry. Other beloved disturbers of shit, like Baudelaire and Rimbaud, later took up the idea. Prose poetry didn\u2019t catch on in North America for another century or so. Even then, it remained controversial. When Mark Strand\u2019s book of prose poems The Monument was up for a Pulitzer, in 1979, one of the judges, Louis Simpson, dissented. The Monument, felt Simpson, just wasn\u2019t poetry. (\u2018If a prize intended for playing the violin were awarded to a trumpet player,\u2019 he reportedly said, \u2018everyone would see immediately how absurd and unacceptable this was.\u2019)\n\n\u201cNoel-Tod, a lecturer at the University of East Anglia, declares that prose poetry is \u2018the defining poetic invention of modernity\u2019 and marvels that the form is \u2018suddenly everywhere.\u2019 He\u2019s probably right about its popularity. A book of the stuff, by Eve Joseph, just scooped up Canada\u2019s $65,000 Griffin Poetry Prize. Other twenty-first-century attempts have drawn acclaim: Claudia Rankine\u2019s book-length meditation on race, Citizen: An American Lyric, and Patricia Lockwood\u2019s viral \u2018Rape Joke.\u2019 Plenty of legacy brands have dabbled in the form, too: Elizabeth Bishop, say, and Seamus Heaney. Noel-Tod\u2019s anthology covers a spectrum, including translations. Front-loaded with contemporary examples, the book runs backward, irising out toward the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\n\u201cBut all this history and activity does nothing to make the form, for skeptics, convincing rather than contrived.\u201d\n\nRead the rest.\n\nPhoto: Seiser Alm\n\nReceive Prufrock in your inbox every weekday morning.
