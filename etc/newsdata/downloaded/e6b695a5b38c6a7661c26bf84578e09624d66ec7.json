Matt said, to which she exclaimed: 'F**k what everyone thinks!'\n\n'F**k what everyone thinks!' Vanessa Sierra (pictured) broke down after Matthew Zukowski questioned if she was being genuine\n\n'Why aren't you shutting it down! I've been firm with you about how I feel,' she argued.\n\nBut what Vanessa didn't know was that Matt was equally as devastated with the rumours - and had broken down in tears in the beach hut earlier that day.\n\n'It sucks. You put yourself out there and then if someone's not... I don't know,' he said to the camera, as tears began to fall down his face.\n\n'I really don't want to feel like that again': Matt (pictured) couldn't hold back the tears as he talked about Vanessa, before requesting his sunglasses to hide his weeping eyes\n\n'I've had my heart broken before. And I really don't want to feel like that again,' he said, before adding: 'Where are my sunnies?'\n\nAfter his breakdown, Vanessa said to Matt: 'I get it if you're feeling off and stuff. But there's been zero communication on your part.\n\n'I've been sitting back [thinking] what the f**k do I do, Matt is talking s**t about me to everyone...,' she added.\n\n'Maybe I am being played' Matt began to question his relationship with Vanessa after rumours emerged she wanted to couple up with him - simply to reach the end of the series\n\n'What's been said about you... it's nothing to do with me,' said Matt.\n\n'Everyone thinks you're not genuine with me. Everyone thinks you're going to flick me as soon as you get out of here.'\n\nLove Island Australia continues Thursday at 8.30pm on Channel Nine", "description": "She's been accused of tactically coupling-up with Matthew Zukowski to 'reach the final' by her fellow Love Island stars.", "authors": ["Nicole Douglas For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/12/19834330-0-image-a-25_1571312171600.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
