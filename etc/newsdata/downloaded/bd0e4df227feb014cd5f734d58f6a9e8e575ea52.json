This is about the game and rugby supporters across the world are absolutely astounded at this rigidity from World Rugby,\" said Dodson.\n\nWorld Rugby said it was not able to reschedule Saturday's planned games with a \"fair and consistent application... for all teams in a safe environment\".\n\nHagibis is on course to hit Tokyo and the surrounding area on Saturday, packing maximum gusts of 216 kilometres per hour (134 miles per hour).\n\nJapan's Meteorological Agency warned that areas from the west to the northeast of the country would experience \"brutal winds and violent seas\".", "description": "World Rugby Friday hit out at Scotland over a \"disappointing\" threat of legal action if their critical match against Japan is cancelled.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9454/f872a886cb4a4600aec05ee47438cab0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
