Rawlson King on Sunday.\n\n\n\nKing proposed a motion to ban handguns following the shooting death of Markland Campbell in the ByWard Market on June 7.\n\n\n\nHis motion was referred to the referred to the Ottawa Police Services Board, which has been tasked with examining what's happening in other jurisdictions to curb gun violence and making appropriate recommendations.\n\n\"It's necessary for us to have more tools ... in our toolbox to really restrict or prohibit handguns within city limits,\" King said.\n\n\"Because we know that if we reduce the number of guns in our cities, we will have less incidents of gun violence.\"\n\nSeized firearms on display at Ottawa police headquarters in 2017.

They're either prohibited from possessing firearms by the court or otherwise wouldn't qualify for a license,\" he said.\n\n\"And the guns they use are almost exclusively smuggled into this country illegally from the United States.\"\n\nSolomon Friedman, an Ottawa criminal defence lawyer, says banning handguns is not the solution to reducing gun violence in Ottawa. (Matthew Kupfer/CBC)\n\n\n\nFriedman said instead governments should focus on addressing the root causes of violence, rather than issuing a blanket ban on handguns.\n\n\n\n\"To tackle a problem like gun violence, look at the core causes of crime: poverty, inequality, mental health and addiction,\" he said. \"It's not a sexy campaign slogan, but in order to meaningfully tackle crime you have to look at the core causes.\"\n\n\n\nKing acknowledged that banning handguns alone is not the solution.\n\n\n\n\"We also need to look at the social investments that are necessary in marginalized neighbourhoods to make sure that youth that are vulnerable ... are not left behind,\" he said.
