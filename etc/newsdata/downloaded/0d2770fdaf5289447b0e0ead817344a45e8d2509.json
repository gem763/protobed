referendums take months to organise.\n\nThen of course we are into the run-up to Christmas and New Year and the public will want to enjoy those, and not be dragged down with any kind of election. We might have extreme weather, and that will put people off from going out to vote.\n\nMy suggestion is for a General Election early February, and whatever the result, we have until the end of March to adjust. Should we get another Referendum, hopefully that could be done sooner rather than later. Possibly have the two on the same day.\n\nRichard Grant\n\nRingwood, Hants\n\nWe need time for proper scrutiny\n\nNow that the Letwin amendment has been passed by parliament the prime minister will have to allow time for his dubious deal to be scrutinised before assent could be given. Could this be properly done in only eight or nine working days? It seems unlikely.\n\nThe Benn Act prevents the UK from being taken out of the EU without a deal on October 31st, the date on which the current extension to Article 50 ends.\n\nIf the EU declines to allow a further extension, then at the end of this month we would be unable to leave with a deal, and unable to leave without one.\n\nSo the only alternative would be revocation of Article 50. Wouldn\u2019t it?\n\nAnd what an exquisite irony it would be if such an eventuality were to arise because of Boris Johnson\u2019s follow-up letter to the EU, in which he said that although he had been obliged to request an extension, such was not his choice.\n\nWe who filled the streets of London on Saturday can only dream\u2026\n\nSusan Alexander\n\nFrampton Cotterell\n\nA divorce from reality\n\nThe initial consultation for the government\u2019s The Divorce, Dissolution and Separation Bill saw 83 per cent of the public are against this change in legislation.\n\nWhy then is the government intent on pushing forward such an unpopular bill? Is this just another example of how government ministers or civil servants do not fully understand marriage and happily ignore the will of the people in this country? Are we a democracy or not?\n\nJ Longstaff\n\nBuxted\n\nA healthy debate\n\nYour article by an American physician claiming that vaping is probably safer than smoking cigarettes suffers from a fallacious argument which I have seen used by others including a UK public health doctor.\n\nCigarette smoking studies are based on a history of at least 130 years of cigarette use, during which time a proportion of several generations have smoked for their entire adult lives. Vaping is recent and not a single generation has lived long enough to make any sensible statistical comparison with smoking. Until two matched cohorts can be compared for their lifetimes no meaningful statistical comparison is possible.\n\nEvan Bayton\n\nWarrington", "description": "Hats off to The Independent for embracing the will of the people and the cherished cause of democracy.
