Congress chief Zainal Kling even said these citizenships could be suspended.\n\nFormer prime minister Najib Razak is on trial over multiple charges of graft and abuse of power. Photo: AP Share:\n\nThe forum put forward five racially contentious demands, including that top civil service positions be reserved for Malays, and constitutionally protected Chinese or Tamil-language schools be shut down.\n\nMahathir Mohamad Prime Minister, who also spoke at the event, said Malays had failed to make progress due to their reluctance to \u201cdo certain jobs\u201d. He warned that the group would continue to be left behind if they refused to work hard and instead relied on hand-outs.\n\nThe government had to take into account the feelings of other ethnic groups, he said. The 94-year-old leader added that political infighting within the Malay community had cost them power and forced them to rely on others.\n\nHe also said that while the congress\u2019 demands would be looked into, \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean the government has to accept the demands\u201d.\n\nMalaysia Mahathir, who was also prime minister from 1981 to 2003, has long exhorted the community to take control of their own fate, but has promoted the affirmative action policies to reduce socio-economic inequality in relation to other races in, which include ethnic Chinese and Indians.\n\nRecently however, his comments have been met with more hostility following fierce pushback from the country\u2019s new opposition \u2013 a partnership between the United Malays National Organisation (Umno) and the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), which has positioned itself as a champion of Malay-Muslim rights.\n\nMahathir\u2019s remarks at the Malay Dignity Congress were made a day after he delivered an address on the government\u2019s Shared Prosperity mandate in which he pledged to increase the incomes of all Malaysians, improve their standard of living and end corruption.\n\nOther government lawmakers have criticised the congress\u2019 organisers. Cabinet minister Darell Leiking said he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d by the event, while Penang state\u2019s second deputy chief minister P. Ramasamy warned that a relentless push towards ethnic nationalism \u201cmight end up in fascism\u201d.\n\nOn the back-burner for the legislative agenda is the oft-repeated refrain of when democracy icon Anwar Ibrahim will take over as leader from Mahathir. Photo: Bloomberg Share:\n\nThese developments, said political scientist James Chin of the University of Tasmania\u2019s Asia Institute, pointed towards an expansionary budget as the government struggles to gain ground among the Malay voter base.\n\nLast year Pakatan Harapan managed to form a government with less than 30 per cent of the Malay vote, while 95 per cent of the country\u2019s voters of Chinese descent were reported to have backed the coalition. Within Pakatan Harapan, Mahathir\u2019s Malaysian United Indigenous Party (Bersatu) and the National Trust Party (Amanah) have struggled to retain relevance with Malay voters who view the government\u2019s multiracial approach with scepticism.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t spend, especially in rural areas, then it will strengthen the opposition\u2019s stance that the Malays are being marginalised, especially by majority-Chinese parties in government. They must buy the Malay ground,\u201d Chin said of the coming budget.\n\n1Malaysia Development Berhad global financial scandal This parliamentary meeting will also see a debate on the Independent Police Complaints and Misconduct Commission Bill, as well as a second attempt to repeal the controversial Anti-Fake News Act which was rejected by the Upper House last year. The National Defence White Paper is on the agenda and lawmakers will also table the Political Funding Bill. The latter, if passed, will join a host of anti-corruption measures launched by the government since it came to power last year in landmark elections in which the former Umno-led administration was toppled after more than six decades in power.
