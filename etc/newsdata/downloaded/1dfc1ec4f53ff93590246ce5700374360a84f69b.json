The company in June had been among the first to announce its plans to take advantage Mac Catalyst \u2014 Apple\u2019s new toolset for bringing iPad apps to the Mac desktop \u2014 following Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developer Conference, where Catalyst had been officially introduced.\n\nThe idea with Catalyst is to make it easier for iOS developers to create software for the Mac ecosystem, by allowing them to leverage their existing iOS project and source code, then layer on native Mac features and convert touch controls to the keyboard and mouse.\n\nTwitter had been one of the more highly anticipated Catalyst apps to arrive, not only because of how it was created, but also because Twitter had decided to kill off its Mac desktop client last year, telling desktop users to just use its website instead.\n\nThat left users who preferred a native Mac experience to turn to third-party apps like TweetDeck, Twitterific 5 or Tweetbot 3. The former is designed more for those who work in social media or are heavy consumers or power users. The latter two, while great alternatives to an official client, are paid applications with a lot more bells and whistles than some require.\n\nTwitter\u2019s new Catalyst app is free and offers a consistent experience with the rest of the Twitter platform apps. The interface is familiar thanks to the code base sharing, and there\u2019s even a dark mode option available. However, its timeline doesn\u2019t refresh in real time \u2014 which has surfaced as one of users\u2019 common complaints about the new app.\n\nOthers pointed out that the full-screen experience is lacking and that the double toolbar seemed like a poor fit. Plus, there are other odd differences between the desktop client and web app, some noted.\n\nThat said, the general sentiment is one where people are glad to have an official app back on the desktop. And it\u2019s possible some of the other complaints will be addressed in time. Or so we hope.\n\nThe app only works on macOS Catalina, which not everyone has installed just yet. It\u2019s a free download from the Mac App Store here.\n\nThe new @Twitter for Mac app is truly one of the funniest (read: worst) pieces of software I\u2019ve ever used.

There are plenty of UI areas that are going to need another pass, for sure.
