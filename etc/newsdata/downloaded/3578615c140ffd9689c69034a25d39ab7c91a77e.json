Cameron (Nic Jackman) is haunted by his actions when Evan died, and on top of the stress of having just come from the crematorium, he\u2019s not in a good place. Then the Grim Reaper arrives on the ward\u2026\n\nMeanwhile, Jac (Rosie Marcel) is also haunted by memories of Joseph and by the constant worry that Emma would rather be living with Jonny and Stacey. Then Stacey (Emily Bowker) arrives and drops a bombshell and Jac\u2019s world begins to crumble. Here are all the spoilers to look out for.\n\n1. Serena (Catherine Russell) is concerned when Cameron insists on going straight to work after his mother\u2019s cremation. He assures her that he\u2019s fine, but he starts thinking he can see Evan everywhere he turns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Jac is furious when Bea (Rosalind Halstead) returns to Darwin because the heart valve repair that Kian (Ramin Karimloo) performed has failed. Then she begins to suspect that Kian and Bea have a more than professional relationship. There\u2019s a showdown between Jac and Kian \u2013 who\u2019ll win?\n\nWell this looks relaxing (Picture: BBC)\n\n3. Dominic (David Ames) is trying to be involved with Helen (Verity Marshall) and Lofty (Lee Mead)\u2019s baby, but his efforts don\u2019t impress Lofty. Can their relationship survive the pressure of the impending arrival?\n\n4. Kian seems to have fallen head over heels for Bea \u2013 but is he letting his feelings cloud his judgement as Jac believes?\n\n5. Stacey visits Jac to give her some news \u2013 and Jac doesn\u2019t react well. With her mental state crumbling, she tries to pretend to Sacha (Bob Barrett) that nothing\u2019s wrong and also pushes Fletch (Alex Walkinshaw) away \u2013 but is she right to be concerned? Is Stacey really trying to take her child from her?\n\nAnd this looks awkward (Picture: BBC)\n\n6. Preparations are underway for the hospital\u2019s 150 year anniversary celebrations and Fletch is worried about giving a speech. He asks Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) \u2013 recovering from his brain surgery on Keller \u2013 for advice.\n\n7. A Halloween-themed patient helps Cameron open up about his mum, but when the patient starts to deteriorate could Cameron, in his distracted state, have missed something important?\n\nSue Haasler is the author of five novels and the official BBC Holby City book, which you can read about here.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Halloween brings with it fear for Cameron \u2014 who's haunted by his actions \u2014 while Jac has fears of her own.", "authors": ["Sue Haasler"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stacey-holby-44-fdc8_1571931874.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
