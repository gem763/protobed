Racist abuse was again clearly audible in the second-half with Kick It Out questioning why Step Three \u2013 to abandon the match \u2013 was not then taken.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

TV footage also clearly shows that racist abuse continued in the second half, so it is unacceptable that Step Three was not enforced. This match should have been abandoned by the officials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now time for Uefa to step up and show some leadership. For far too long, they have consistently failed to take effective action. The fact Bulgaria are already hosting this game with a partial stadium closure for racist abuse shows that Uefa\u2019s sanctions are not fit for purpose.\n\n\u201cThere can be no more pitiful fines or short stadium bans. If Uefa care at all about tackling discrimination \u2013 and if the Equal Game campaign means anything \u2013 then points deductions and tournament expulsion must follow.\u201d", "description": "Kick It Out have criticised Uefa after the governing body failed to correctly implement its three-step protocol during England\u2018s 6-0 victory over Bulgaria,\u00a0and said that Monday\u2019s match should have been abandoned amid the \u201csickening\u201d scenes of racist abuse.", "authors": ["Tom Kershaw"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/23/18/kick-it-out.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
