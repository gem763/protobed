Tulsi Gabbard, in a widely watched Twitter-posted YouTube video, condemned the \u201crich, powerful\u201d gang of elites who surround Hillary Clinton and demand Democrats either \u201ctoe the line\u201d or stay silent.\n\nThat\u2019s good. But it\u2019s not exactly an \u201cenemy of my enemy is a friend\u201d moment; Gabbard, after all, has some far-left and outlandish views. She\u2019s a progressive who has some serious flip-flops on policy in her background that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked simply because she\u2019s taking on Hillary, and hard.\n\nStill: We can enjoy the anti-Clinton moment for a moment, yes?\n\nHere\u2019s what Gabbard wrote, on Twitter: \u201cHillary & her gang of rich, powerful elite are going after me to send a msg to YOU: \u2018Shut up, toe the line, or be destroyed.\u2019 But we, the people, will NOT be silenced. Join me in taking our Democratic Party back & leading a govt of, by & for the people!\u201d\n\nIn the accompanying video, Gabbard said that she had been warned in 2016 that her endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 who went against Clinton for the party\u2019s nomination for president \u2014 would \u201cbe the end\u201d of her political career.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018Clinton will never forget,\u2019 \u201d Gabbard said.\n\nAnd since, Gabbard said \u2014 Clinton and \u201cher powerful friends\u201d have been busily \u201cfalsely portray[ing] me as a traitor.\u201d\n\nShe went on: \u201cBut here is the truth. They will not intimidate us. They will not silence us. \u2026 I\u2019m running for president to take the Democratic Party and our country back from the corrupt elite.\u201d\n\nGabbard\u2019s video and tweet came after Clinton spread the idea, via an interview with podcaster David Plouffe, that Russians were \u201cgrooming\u201d a U.S. female presidential hopeful \u201cto be the third-party candidate\u201d \u2014 an obvious reference to Gabbard.\n\nGabbard responded to that sting with a tweet that read, \u201cThank you Hillary Clinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for s long, have finally come out from behind the curtain.\u201d\n\nOuch to Hillary.\n\nYay to Hillary haters.\n\nBut hold the phone on Gabbard as a hero to the people.\n\nGabbard\u2019s platforms include \u201cresponsible, common sense gun safety reform\u201d \u2014 liberal code for curbs on the Second Amendment; \u201cMedicare for All\u201d \u2014 liberal code for universal health care, as a natural-born right; and the Barack Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. She\u2019s also done a 180 on her previously stated opposition to abortion and on her LGBTQ views. In the early 2000s, Gabbard supported traditional marriage; since, she\u2019s apologized to the LGBTQ community,\n\n\u201cIn my past, I said and believed things that were wrong and worse, hurtful to people in the LGBTQ community,\u201d Gabbard said in 2019, in a video. \u201cMy views have changed. \u2026 [and I now have] a strong and ongoing commitment to fighting for LGBTQ rights.\u201d\n\nFlip. Flop.\n\nGabbard has got some serious military chops. Gabbard is possessed of some seriously bold fighting words against one of America\u2019s most corrupt politicians. But let\u2019s remember: Gabbard is still a far-left Democrat.\n\nGabbard for president is like Sen. Elizabeth Warren for president, is like Sen. Bernie Sanders for president, is like Mayor Pete Buttigieg for president, is like Sen. Kamala Harris for president. They\u2019re all progressives masked as Democrats. They\u2019re all cut from the same socialist-styled cloth that makes them unsuited to lead the democratic-republic of America.
