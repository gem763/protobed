Court Filing from PACER (U.S. Dist. Court C.D. Cal.) via REUTERS NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVES. THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY.\n\nIn a complaint filed on Monday, Grande said Forever 21 and Riley Rose misappropriated her name, image, likeness and music, including by employing a \u201cstrikingly similar\u201d looking model, in a website and social media campaign early this year.\n\nShe said this followed the breakdown of talks for a joint marketing campaign because Forever 21 would not pay enough for \u201ca celebrity of Ms. Grande\u2019s stature,\u201d whose longer-term endorsements generate millions of dollars in fees.\n\nGrande has more than 65 million Twitter followers and 163 million Instagram followers.
