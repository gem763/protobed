I mean, I didn\u2019t think his acting was that great, you know when he was doing the fake punches.\n\n\u2018I love people who think WWE is real. Great promotion. I don\u2019t know who came up with it, but brilliant.\u2019\n\nAsked if Joshua would consider making a WWE appearance of his own \u2013 particularly if there was money involved \u2013 Hearn continued: \u2018No I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be down for that.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think there was any money involved, it was more just great exposure. What was it, 3.8 million people watching? It\u2019s brilliant, great, very clever.\n\nFury called out Strowman again after their second brawl on Raw (Picture: WWE)\n\n\u2018Again, it\u2019s another one of those things where people say, \u201cOh it\u2019s so cringe\u201d. And they just don\u2019t realise the bigger picture.\u2019\n\nJoshua is currently preparing for his rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabia in December as he looks to win back the belts he surprisingly lost against the Mexican at Madison Square Garden over the summer.\n\nFury will hopefully be back in the ring in February next year to face Deontay Wilder if his cuts heal in time, and promoter Frank Warren told Metro.co.uk he wasn\u2019t overly happy to see the Gypsy King risking opening up the gashes as arms flailed in his melee with Strowman.", "description": "Eddie Hearn has praised Tyson Fury for his much talked about WWE appearance but does not believe Anthony Joshua will be following his heavyweight rival into the wrestling ring anytime...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1147414347_1570671276.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
