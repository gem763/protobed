Nothing is made explicit here, but it starts to set new expectations about the coming course of policy for 2020.\u201d\n\nIn late 2017, Kim visited Mount Paektu days after North Korea launched its largest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), and weeks before he made a key New Year speech in which he opened the door to engagement with South Korea.\n\nLast year, Kim took South Korean president Moon Jae-in to the top of the mountain as part of a historic summit.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kim Jong-un gets up some speed on Mount Paektu.

That would enable the North to show its economic and technological power in a less provocative way than by testing an ICBM.\n\nRachel Minyoung Lee, an analyst with NK News, a website that monitors North Korea, said: \u201cThe report in Korean has characterised Kim\u2019s climb up to Mount Paektu on horseback as a new \u2018myth\u2019, and that, together with the images of him on a white horse, appear to have been designed to create maximum propaganda effect, which I believe media will play up in the days to come.\u201d", "description": "North Korean leader\u2019s heavily publicised trip up Mount Paektu on white horse could be sign of a big decision", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fafaed6d8c2c2de39fc5c14680095a872a249ba0/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=90fffd5dd60e1d62166980ade2431aee", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
