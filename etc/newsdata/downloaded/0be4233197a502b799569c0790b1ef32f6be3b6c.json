Even some gentle chiding by U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson did nothing to convince Trump to contemplate a truce.\n\nAfter Trump briefly suggested on Sunday that he has had second thoughts about jacking up tariffs again, an aide clarified that the president\u2019s only regret is not raising the levies even higher.\n\nTrump did not escalate previous threats that he had made against the Europeans and he was uncharacteristically friendly to Merkel.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other G7 leaders used the summit to make a strong lobbying push, aimed at stopping Trump from further disintegrating global trade flows. But by the end, they only seemed to have patched up a bit of the worst damage done by the self-appointed \"tariff man\" by persuading him to soften his rhetoric against China, which had seemed to reach maximum bluster when he ordered American companies to shut operations there.\n\nMonday raised a bit of hope for a d\u00e9tente with Beijing, with Trump declaring that the Chinese wanted to continue to negotiate, and he praised the talks he has been engaged in with them in recent months as \"very meaningful.\"\n\nTrump also did not escalate previous threats that he had made against the Europeans and he was uncharacteristically friendly to Merkel, calling her a \"brilliant woman,\" while expressing optimism that the EU and U.S. could reach a trade deal \"very soon.\"\n\nAnd as a silver lining, the U.S. and France appeared to reach a truce on their digital services tax spat \u2014 although Trump refused to publicly renounce his threat to impose punitive tariffs on French wine. In one other small bright spot, Washington agreed a preliminary trade deal with Japan.\n\nNo shortage of disagreement\n\nNone of those developments are particularly reassuring for advocates of free trade, however. There is no indication that the U.S. and China are in reality any closer to de-escalation, and past months have shown that Trump predictions of an upcoming \"deal\" with China tend to be short-lived: Sometimes, they only last until his next tweet.\n\nThe EU's trade talks with Washington also remain gridlocked as disagreement persists over Washington's demand to expand the talks to include agriculture products. Despite the positive chatter at the Merkel-Trump meeting, neither of the leaders suggested any clear escape route from this standoff.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S.-Japan deal, while encouraging on its surface, on closer inspection contains provisions that are deeply worrying for the EU, which like Japan is under threat for tariffs on automobiles. Trump admitted outright on Monday that his blackmailing strategy of threatening sky-high tariffs on Japanese carmakers has forced Tokyo to make concessions, describing his auto tariffs as \"one of the reasons why we did this deal.\u201d\n\nMore fundamentally for all of the countries, there was still no progress this weekend on preventing the World Trade Organization and the wider system of global trade rules from falling apart when the WTO's dispute resolution body effectively becomes inoperable at the end of this year.\n\nThe G7's one-page statement, issued by Macron, noted that \"the G7 wishes to overhaul the WTO to improve effectiveness,\" but Trump made immediately clear at his closing press conference that he was not satisfied with the scope of proposed reforms.\n\nThe text further called on finance ministers \u201cto closely monitor the state of the global economy\u201d \u2014 a rather somber statement compared to past declarations expressing shared resolve to spur growth and improve living standards.\n\nIt was hardly an expression of confidence \u2014 in the economy, or in each other. And the declaration's overall tone suggested that the G7 club is no longer aimed at making sure the rich get richer, and the poor benefit, too. Now, it seems everybody is just trying to stay afloat.\n\nAt his closing press conference, Macron sounded more enthusiastic, saying that G7 leaders had agreed \"to accelerate with a very realistic agenda ... to change the rules of world trade.\" But translating those words into a written agreement, let alone into concrete action, will not be an easy task.", "description": "National leaders leave annual summit with few promises for global economy.", "authors": ["Hans Von Der Burchard", "David M.
