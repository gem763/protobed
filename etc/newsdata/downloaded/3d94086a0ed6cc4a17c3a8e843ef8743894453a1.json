Time\n\nNetflix, which dominates streaming, says it will continue to hold the crown, even in the face of intense new competition in November from the likes of Apple and Disney.\n\nThe new streamers, which also include Warner Media's HBO Max and the Peacock, from NBC, both set to launch in the spring, \"have some great titles (especially catalog titles),\" Netflix said in a note to accompany its third quarter earnings Wednesday. But \"none have the variety, diversity and quality of new original programming that we are producing around the world.\"\n\nHowever, the company saw a smaller subscriber gain than analysts projected, for the second quarter in a row, with 6.7 million added, short of its 7 million projection. The company, which now has 158 million subscribers worldwide, had lost 130,000 subscribers domestically in the previous quarter.\n\nStreaming showdown: How to decide what's best for you\n\nNetflix hack: Why would somebody bother to hack your account on the streaming service?\n\nNetflix says it will retain the streaming crown.

In the first four weeks of the third season of its breakout hit Stranger Things, Netflix said some 64 million people tuned in.\n\nAnd for the docu-drama limited series Unbelievable, about two police officers trying to solve a rape case, 32 million tuned in for the first 28 days.\n\nBy comparison, the highest rated scripted TV show, NCIS, saw some 12.5 million tuning in to a recent episode.\n\nApple's TV + is set to debut on Nov. 1, and looks to undercut Netflix with a substantially lower subscription fee, $4.99 monthly, or one year free with purchase of an Apple product (iPhone, iPad, computer, Apple TV streaming box of iPod Touch.) The Disney+ service, which offers library content from the Disney, Marvel, Pixar, National Geographic and Lucasfilm libraries, is $6.99.\n\nNetflix's most popular pricing is $13.99 monthly.\n\nCLOSE Actors on the Emmys 2019 red carpet tell us how they feel about your ability to binge-watch an entire season of a show and not wait a week for a new episode.
