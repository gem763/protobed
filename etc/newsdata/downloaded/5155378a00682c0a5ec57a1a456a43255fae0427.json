(Steve C. Wilson/AP)\n\nPatrick Byrne, the firebrand founder of Overstock.com who abruptly quit as chief executive last month, has dumped his $90 million stake in the company.\n\nByrne sold off more than 4.7 million shares this week, according to a company filing, and said in a blog post that he will invest the proceeds in gold, silver and two cryptocurrencies to shield his fortune from \u201cacts of retaliation from the Deep State.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been following the US economy and the deteriorating world situation, and I am growing worried,\u201d Byrne wrote in an open letter to former colleagues Wednesday. His new investments, he said, would soar during \u201ca recession (or even worse, if The Big One comes),\u201d allowing him to provide cash to Overstock as necessary.\n\n[Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne resigns after saying he aided in \u2018deep state\u2019 Russia investigation]\n\nThe 56-year-old, who used to be Overstock\u2019s largest shareholder, set off a frenzy last month when he said he had been involved in multiple FBI investigations and had romanced Maria Butina \u2014 a Russian gun rights activist who is now serving 18 months in prison for trying to influence U.S. policy ahead of the 2016 election \u2014 allegedly at the behest of federal authorities. Shares of Overstock fell 36 percent in the days after Byrne\u2019s comments, and he resigned a week later.\n\nIn an email to The Washington Post, Byrne \u2014 who said he was traveling in Asia \u2014 said he has cashed out of roughly $125 million worth of company shares in the past year.\n\nHe decided to sell off everything this week, he said in the blog post, after he got word that the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 \u201cthe Deep State\u2019s pets\u201d \u2014 was going to scuttle Overstock\u2019s plans to pay its next shareholder dividend in a company-issued cryptocurrency.\n\nOverstock said Wednesday it was postponing its plans while it sorts out regulatory logistics. A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment.\n\nSelling off his stake, Byrne wrote, was also a way to protect the company from regulators who \u201cwould try to break Overstock as a way of crippling me.\u201d\n\n[Shares of Overstock are plummeting after the CEO says he aided in \u2018Russian investigation\u2019]\n\n\u201cWith me no longer an executive, a board member, or even a shareholder, it becomes pointless for them to try to get at me that way,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere are other ways they will come for me, but there is no edge for them to come through Overstock to do it.\u201d\n\nOverstock shares have fallen nearly 40 percent in the past week. They were trading Thursday at about $16 a share, down from a peak of $84.35 in January 2018.\n\nOverstock, founded 20 years ago as an online marketplace for excess merchandise, is best known for selling furniture, bedsheets and other home goods. In recent years, though, the company has shifted its focus from retail to new blockchain ventures.\n\nByrne also has become vocal about his alleged involvement with the FBI. In a company news release last month, he said that he had been working with the \u201cMen in Black\u201d on their investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and that his \u201cRabbi,\u201d Warren Buffett, had advised him to tell the American people what he knew. (The FBI declined to comment.)\n\nByrne said that he had not wanted to come forward but that seeing \u201cmy country pull itself apart while I knew many answers\u201d convinced him that it was time to speak out. This week, he doubled down on that promise.\n\n\u201cYou think me controversial now, but you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet,\u201d Byrne wrote Wednesday. \u201cI know enough to fry the Deep State to ashes.\u201d", "description": "Patrick Byrne abruptly quit the company last month after saying he'd been involved in multiple FBI investigations and had romanced Maria Butina \u2014 a Russian national later convicted of trying to influence American policy.", "authors": ["Abha Bhattarai", "Reporter Covering The Retail Industry", "September At Pm", "Abha Bhattarai Is The National Retail Reporter For The Washington Post.
