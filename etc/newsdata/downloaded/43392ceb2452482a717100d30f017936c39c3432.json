Stewart writes in his new book Deep State: Trump, the FBI, and the Rule of Law.\n\nAccording to the book, Weiner's iPad, iPhone and laptop unveiled 340,000 emails between Hillary Clinton and her top aide Huma Abedin, Weiner's estranged wife, many using a hillaryclinton.com address\n\nAt the time the FBI were investigating explicit messages sent by Weiner to a 15-year-old girl\n\nDeep State says that the new emails that were found on Weiner's devices by a lowly but determined FBI case officer.\n\nJames B. Stewart's new book Deep State: Trump, the FBI, and the Rule of Law is out today\n\n'I'm telling you that we have potentially ten times the volume that Director Comey said we had on the record,' the agent told Stewart. 'Why isn't anybody here?'\n\nNobody at the FBI was taking action so he went outside the chain of command to New York prosecutors, starting a chain of events that led to James Comey reopening the investigation days before the 2016 election.\n\nStewart also reveals that former Comey had deep concerns about the impartiality of former Attorney General Loretta Lynch.\n\nWhen it came to the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, Comey considered asking for her to appoint a Special Counsel because he was so alarmed - but she rebuffed him\n\nThe book also claims that FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who was caught sending anti-Donald Trump texts, lied about her affair with FBI agent Peter Strzok when the director of the bureau confronted her.\n\nPage told Andrew McCabe that she and Strzok were not an item and had never been romantically involved.\n\nPage was 'acutely embarrassed, mortified' that her affair was public but chose to lie rather than tell the truth, Stewart writes in the book.\n\nWhen their relationship did become public, so did the texts they exchanged mocking Trump and his supporters, with the two becoming a symbol of the so-called Deep State that was out to get the President.\n\nStewart also reveals that former FBI director James Comey had deep concerns about the impartiality of former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. When it came to the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, Comey considered asking for her to appoint a Special Counsel because he was so alarmed - but she rebuffed him\n\nFBI lawyer Lisa Page lied to Andrew McCabe about her relationship with agent Peter Strzok (right), new book Deep State: Trump, the FBI, and the Rule of Law claims. Strzok, who worked on Robert Mueller's probe, was caught calling Trump an 'idiot' and discussing an 'insurance policy' if Trump won the 2016 election\n\nThe relationship between Page and Strzok has become a lightning rod for Trump and his allies who see it as evidence of bias in the investigation into Russian interference.\n\nStrzok worked on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation but his texts to Page appeared to show a bias, such as discussing an 'insurance policy' if Trump won the 2016 election.\n\nStrzok also called Trump an 'idiot' and after he won wrote to Page: 'OMG I am so depressed'.", "description": "An agent rifling through Weiner's iPad, iPhone and laptop found 340,000 emails between Clinton and her top aide Huma Abedin, Weiner's ex, many using a\u00a0hillaryclinton.com address.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/08/19480610-0-image-a-2_1570607955370.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
