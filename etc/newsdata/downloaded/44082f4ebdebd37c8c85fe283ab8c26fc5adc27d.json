They also requested records related to Giuliani's attempts to investigate fringe theories about the origins of Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nThe chairmen, who also requested documents from three of Giuliani's business associates, said their latest subpoena is a \"key\" element in their intensifying impeachment inquiry, which was announced last week by Speaker Nancy Pelosi after the revelation that Mr. Trump asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens during a call in late July.\n\nThe stunning development, corroborated by both a White House memorandum of the call and a whistleblower complaint filed by a member of the intelligence community, has set of an extraordinary series of events in Washington that could lead House Democrats to file articles of impeachment against the president.\n\nAlong with denouncing the call between Mr. Trump and Zelensky, the whistleblower in the complaint detailed what amounted to a rogue diplomatic campaign by Giuliani to communicate with top aides to the Ukrainian leader to convey Mr. Trump's political requests. The State Department has confirmed that some of its top officials, including the former U.S. envoy to Ukraine, facilitated Giuliani's efforts, but the agency denied that Mr. Trump's personal attorney spoke \"on behalf\" of the U.S. government.\n\nDuring an interview on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, Giuliani said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was aware of his unorthodox diplomatic efforts. But Giuliani said the State Department was trying to down play its role in his outreach to Ukraine.\n\n\"The State Department is running away from me,\" he said.", "description": "Three House committees issued a subpoena demanding documents related to Rudy Giuliani's attempts to pressure the Ukrainian government", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/21/670e6f74-5785-4205-b2c6-9a876528cee9/thumbnail/1200x630g1/ed2fcd85536bf3ee0b0743560dd9cb87/gettyimages-963760790.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
