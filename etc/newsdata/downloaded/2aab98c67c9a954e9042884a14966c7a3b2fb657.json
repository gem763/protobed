The location is off the main highway that connects Reynosa with San Fernando.\n\nInformation provided to Breitbart Texas by law enforcement sources revealed that a group of gunmen held three young men in handcuffs. The gunmen forced the three to kneel, shot them each point-blank, and fled.\n\nTamaulipas authorities rushed to the scene to document and collect the bodies. The three suspects remain unidentified.\n\nThe public execution comes at a time when rival factions of the Gulf Cartel are clashing in and around Reynosa; leading to several gun battles, kidnappings, and executions. The infighting is confusing Mexican authorities as rival cells frequently shift allegiances.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo Le\u00f3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities. The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.
