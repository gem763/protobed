That\u2019s fair enough. There are some people who are misrepresenting the Verita report.\n\n\u201cSome people are saying the Verita report said I shouldn\u2019t work with children,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the case. I had a lapse of judgement, and there was a need for me to undergo training and have access to better support.\n\n\u201cI have learnt from the Verita report and taken on board their recommendations for further training and support.\n\n\u201cIt has shaped how we handle these matters at Prism. For example we used to offer one to one support.\n\n\u201cWe now no longer do, it\u2019s always two members to one person. We are taking these safeguards seriously.\n\nCoventry Commander, Chief Superintendent Mike O\u2019Hara said: \u201cWe are committed to working with our community and partner agencies to reduce hate crime in our city.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Prism has been criticised for working with Aimee Challenor - who left the Green Party in disgrace after using her dad as an election agent while on bail accused of raping a 10-year-old", "authors": ["Alan Selby", "Image", "Birmingham Mail", "West Midlands Police", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13171064.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_IFP_BEM_010617Hustings014JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
