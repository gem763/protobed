Quenton, now 33, double majored in telecommunications and criminal justice at Michigan State University. And Marchelle, 28, took up secondary education at the University of Detroit, Mercy, where she got her bachelor\u2019s before earning her master\u2019s educational administration.\n\nWhen Quenton graduated in 2008, his loans totaled around $40,000 before interest. When Marchelle graduated in 2016, her undergrad and post-grad loans were about $77,000.\n\nTogether, they owed roughly $118,000. And while they both received scholarships in high school that went toward their college education, it didn\u2019t make much of a dent in the debt.\n\n\u201cI never really heard about [people paying off their student loans] too much,\u201d Quenton told Fox Business. \u201cMy mom had loans for, like, 20 years after she graduated. It was just kind of something that you assumed would always linger around and never go away.\n\n\u201cSo that's kind of how I looked at it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s until the couple, who got married in 2015, decided to try and beat the odds.\n\n\u201cIt all boiled down to freedom,\u201d Quenton said. \u201cI didn't want to work my entire life \u2026 and always have to pay bills. I wanted to get to a point to where I was able to live freely and comfortably and not say, \u2018I have to work a full-time job when I'm 60, 70 years old.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat was our driving force. It wasn't just the debt. It was really a bigger factor for us.\u201d\n\nMarchelle agreed: \u201cWe talked about a lot of very serious things in our relationship so that we were on the same page,\u201d she told Fox Business. \u201cWe were very clear on what we wanted: We wanted to sacrifice young so we could enjoy life when we got older.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after school, though, that they started paying back. And not all at once.\n\n\u201cI always paid the minimum balance because I was conscious of maintaining good credit,\u201d Quenton said, \u201cbut I didn't really know how interest worked.\u201d Plus, a lot of the advice he got from advisors and peers was to apply for deferment and stay on for as long as possible.\n\nThat\u2019s what he did, unaware that interest began accruing immediately after graduation with rates as high as 7% or more on Plus loans, according to the U.S. Treasury.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nMarchelle paid back a bit during undergrad, but \u201cit was just the minimum,\u201d she said, and due to high interest, \u201cmy amount was going up, not down. So, I deferred when I went back.\n\n\u201cIt was frustrating,\u201d she added. \u201cBut we knew this could not go on forever.\u201d\n\nThe couple decided to lean on some reliable mentors they met during school, and financial expert Dave Ramsey\u2019s \u201cThe Total Money Makeover,\u201d a book that \u201cchanged our mentality on how paying the debt was possible,\u201d Quenton said.\n\nThey implemented the snowball method, where they paid the smallest loan first, then moved on to the next largest one after \u2014 a method used by Danny and Amber Masters, who racked up $600,000 in student loans and paid $200,000 in a year, and Redd Horrocks, a self-employed voiceover artist, who paid $39,000 in debt in 5 years.\n\nWith the first check of the month, Quenton said, \u201cwe would make sure we had money for mortgage, the utilities, everything else, and then with the second check of the month we would put toward whatever loan we were focusing on at that time.\u201d\n\nIt helped that Quenton owned a business, Q11 Photography, which opened in 2017, and in addition to his full-time job as a director of a production at a broadcasting company, generated a good deal of income. He estimates he was bringing in about $100,000 a year.\n\nMarchelle, who was a teacher at the time, was making around $50,000.\n\nDespite their combined $150,000 income, the couple still took steps to cut back on their expenses and focus on their debt, frequently asking themselves, \u201cWhat do we spend daily, or weekly, on things we don\u2019t need? What are our shopping habits? How conservative are we with driving?\u201d Quenton recalled. \u201cThat's something we took a really hard look at.\n\n\u201cI didn't even go to the barbershop the entire time,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned to cut my own hair.\u201d\n\nThey reevaluated their grocery budget, too, Marchelle added, \u201clike, \u2018OK, let\u2019s eat out less and only shop for what we need to cook for the next couple of days instead of buying food that goes to waste. And the money we saved by doing that would \u2026 go toward our debt.\n\nAs well, she said, \u201ceven though I\u2019m a social person, I would say, \u2018Let's go grab ice cream instead of a whole meal.\u2019 Something that costs $4 versus $25. Or, \u2018Why don't you come to my house and I can cook as opposed to going out and paying exponentially more.\u201d\n\nIn 29 months, the debt was gone.\n\nUnlike the Ross\u2019, a striking 60% of student debt borrowers don\u2019t expect to pay off their loans until their 40s, according to research from Citizens Financial Group.\n\nAnd while the couple was able to beat the odds, they acknowledge it wasn\u2019t easy.\n\n\u201cIt irritated me the way interest works,\u201d Quenton said. \u201cThere would be times where I would make a $300 payment, $400 payment in between regular monthly payments and be expecting a huge difference in the amount we owed. But so much of that extra money was going toward interest and not principle. A lot of times you\u2019d want to say, \u2018Man, just skip this. We can take this money and put it toward something that could breed immediate results.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut they kept at it, and now that their debt is gone, they want to focus on more important things, like taking vacations together, donating to charity, buying property and injecting money into Q11 Photography. Plus, Quenton said, \u201cI can finally go to the barbershop.\u201d\n\nAbove all, though, they wanted to be able to start a family.\n\n\u201cOur main goal was not to birth a child into debt,\u201d Quenton said. \u201cSo, whenever we have a baby \u2026 they won't be adding to an insurmountable debt they had nothing to do with.\"\n\n\"Now we can stick our chests out as husband and wife say we can do that,\u201d Marchelle added, \"and God gets the glory. We worked hard but we couldn't have done it without faith.\"\n\nTheir advice to those struggling to pay down debt: Do the work.\n\n\u201cWe tell everybody that there are no shortcuts,\u201d Quenton said. \u201cWe don't want you to have a five-minute conversation with us and then think you have some master plan. Read the books, study, learn the nuances of interest and paying back debt. Talking to us, you'll find out what works for us. But by doing the work, you'll find out what will work for you.\n\n\u201cWhen I think about the value of college,\u201d he added, \u201cI tell people that a degree doesn't prove you learned a lot in class, instead, it shows that you were able to matriculate through a structured system for four years, while having the freedom to do whatever you wanted.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO\n\nAnd paying off debt is almost the exact same way: \u201cYou have to commit to the process while having the freedom to spend your money on other things. You have to read on your own, study on your own and understand that everything matters. Even the small payments that you think are irrelevant are needed and will be applied toward reaching your end goal.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI didn't want to work my entire life \u2026 and always have to pay bills,\u201d Quenton Ross, one half of the couple, told Fox Business. \u201cIt wasn't the just debt.
