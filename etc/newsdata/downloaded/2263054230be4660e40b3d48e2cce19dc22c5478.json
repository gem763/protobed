If we can imagine a scenario, a motivated terrorist can imagine a worse one,\u201d said David Wulf, who oversees chemical security for DHS.\n\nSpeaking at a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Wulf said a chemical plant attack could have \u201cdevastating consequences.\u201d\n\nEnacted in 2007, CFATS applies to more than 33,000 facilities that store any chemical on a list of more than 300 substances that could be used to create an explosive device. CFATS was expected to expire in January, but a last-minute Senate deal extended the program for another 15 months.\n\nA CFATS extension appeared to have bipartisan support among the committee members, but some Republicans worried the regulations\u2019 costs would burden local businesses.\n\n\u201cWe just want to be careful that we don\u2019t drive some good manufacturing in relatively safe areas in rural America out of rural America,\u201d said Rep. John Shimkus of Illinois, the top-ranking Republican on the committee.\n\nMr. Wulf said that while some facilities that have gone through a CFATS evaluation have shuttered, he was \u201cpretty certain\u201d the closures weren\u2019t related to the program.\n\nDespite concerns about onerous requirements, Mr. Shimkus conceded that CFATS has created safer chemical facilities.\n\n\u201cWe all acknowledge the fact that we want to get as long-term reauthorization as we can,\u201d he said.\n\nIndustry executives urged Congress to extend the program, saying that keeping the regulations in place will help manufacturers understand what needs to be done to prevent a terror attack.\n\nScott Whelchel, chief security officer and director of emergency services for Dow, said an extension would provide \u201cmuch-needed stability.\u201d\n\nMr. Wulf said the program was effective, telling lawmakers that facilities on average achieve \u201ca 55% increase\u201d in overall security because of CFATS. He estimated the program resulted in the implementation that \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of security measures have been put in place at chemical facilities across the nation.\n\nLawmakers generally agreed with Mr. Wulf.\n\n\u201cEveryone here understands the importance of an extension, which would give the program a vital measure of certainty and stability,\u201d said Rep. Paul Tonko, New York Democrat.\n\n\u201cThreats to chemical facilities continue to evolve from cybersecurity to extreme weather events and the programs that guarantee the safety of workers, first responders and frontline communities must also evolve to meet these threats,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
