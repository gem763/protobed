As Dolphins cornerback Ken Webster started to drift that direction, the Redskins wide receiver cut back to his left \u2014 creating enough separation to break free.\n\nBy the time Webster realized it was a fake, he couldn\u2019t make up the ground. Case Keenum unleashed the ball, finding McLaurin in the end zone for the touchdown.\n\n\u201cI thought the seven-cut corner route that he ran,\u201d interim coach Bill Callahan said, \u201cit was an art-form piece of work in terms of his route running.\u201d\n\nMcLaurin\u2019s precise route running made a huge difference in the Redskins\u2019 17-16 win Sunday over the Miami Dolphins as the 24-year-old hauled in both of Washington\u2019s touchdowns. It was another instance this season of McLaurin emerging as the Redskins\u2019 top receiver.\n\nAgainst Miami, McLaurin had four catches for 100 yards on seven targets.\n\nThis season \u2014 even with a game missed due to a hamstring injury \u2014 McLaurin leads the Redskin in targets.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s extremely talented,\u201d Keenum said. \u201cHe\u2019s friendly on the eyes as a quarter. Just the body language he gives in and out of his breaks, it makes sense. I know where he\u2019s going to be at all times.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins have long-needed a receiver like that. After Washington lost DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon in the 2017 offseason, the team has lacked a No.1 target as various options \u2014 Terrelle Pryor in free agency, Josh Doctson through the draft \u2014 failed to pan out. With McLaurin, the Redskins drafted the 24-year-old in the third round, but didn\u2019t expect him to be this much of a contributor right away.\n\nMcLaurin, though, quickly rocketed up the team\u2019s depth chart. He impressed in OTAs and in training camp \u2014 so much so that former coach Jay Gruden held the rookie out of a preseason game as a precaution when McLaurin was dealing with a minor injury. He won the starting spot opposite of Paul Richardson, leading Washington to cut Doctson before the start of the regular season.\n\nIn five games, McLaurin has 23 for 408 yards. Beyond being a deep threat down the field, McLaurin\u2019s precision in his routes gives the Redskins\u2019 offense versatility. They can dial up a variety of plays and McLaurin tends to execute.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I work so hard,\u201d McLaurin said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you want to be one of the great receivers in this league. You\u2019ve got to be able to beat press-man when the game is on the line.\u201d\n\nMcLaurin\u2019s best route of the day, however, might have been on a play that didn\u2019t result in a touchdown. As the Dolphins were mounting a comeback in the fourth quarter, the Redskins ran play-action backed up near their own goal line. The fake fooled Miami\u2019s defense and McLaurin again created enough separation to be found for a 31-yard gain.\n\nBy converting the first down, the Redskins continued to take time off the clock until they had to punt with more than two minutes left.\n\nMcLaurin said he was just trying to atone for a mistake earlier that quarter, when he dropped a pass from Keenum. The drop, he said, was \u201cstuck\u201d in his head.\n\n\u201cI told the guys that I was going to make up for it,\u201d McLaurin said. \u201cI feel like that was a big play in the game and I just wanted to make up for the previous mishap.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
