Earlier Monday, he held a moment of silence at a monument to its Ukrainian victims.\n\nPolice deployed around key sites in the Ukrainian capital as more than 10,000 people marched under a blanket of yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flags, in one of several nationalist gatherings Monday to mark Defense of the Homeland Day. Zelenskiy urged participants to avoid violence and warned of potential \u201cprovocations\u201d from those who want to stoke chaos.\n\nBlack-clad men holding up red flares like torches led the procession, some in white masks to conceal their identity.\n\n\u201cGlory to Ukraine!\u201d they chanted. \u201cNo capitulation!\u201d\n\nThe crowd included uniformed veterans of the conflict who are urging Zelenskiy not to allow a troop withdrawal, local elections or amnesty for separatists. All are elements of a long-stalled peace plan that the Ukrainian president is trying to revive.\n\n\u201cWhat price is Zelenskiy ready to pay? He\u2019s ready to sell all of us out to make peace with Russia. And we will not be silent,\u201d said 46-year-old veteran Taras Volochko.\n\n\u201cWithdrawing troops is a catastrophe for the country. Russia is using the situation to seize the territories we withdraw from,\u201d Andriy Biletsky, head of the far-right group National Corps, told The Associated Press.\n\nZelenskiy, a comedian who rose to the presidency this year on promises to end the conflict, thanked Ukrainian troops for defending the country from outside influence \u2014 and urged them to \u201ccome back alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cUkraine is an independent, sovereign, unified and democratic state,\u201d he told them, concluding his speech with his own \u201cGlory to Ukraine!\u201d\n\nUkraine, Russia and the separatists signed a preliminary agreement earlier this month to pull back heavy weaponry and to hold an election in the area at a later date. The pullback has not occurred because of shelling from both sides and threats from Ukrainian hardliners to hamper the disengagement.\n\nZelenskiy is sticking to the accord, insisting that it\u2019s the only way for his country to move forward.\n\nHe still enjoys the support of most Ukrainians, who argue he needs to be given time to fulfil his promises to revive the economy. Ukrainians have also shrugged off his embarrassing phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump that unleashed an impeachment inquiry in the United States.\n\n\u201cI love my country but I\u2019m not like those nationalists, I don\u2019t have time for protests. And what good does that bring?\u201d asked Nadiya Kuzmenko, 68, a former arms factory worker who cleans houses to supplement her $125 monthly pension.\n\nThe marchers in Kyiv rallied at the Maidan square, a symbol of Ukrainian uprisings against Russian influence. Thousands continued on to the presidential headquarters overlooking the capital. Kyiv authorities said the main march ended peacefully.\n\nA crowd in front of the president\u2019s administration accused Zelenskiy of being a \u201cservant of the Kremlin\u201d and is trying to \u201cstrike a deal with the devil.\u201d\n\nCritics call the accord a \u201ccapitulation\u201d to Russia and fear it will lead to Russia having the upper hand in deciding the future for the conflict-torn region. \u201cPeace after Victory\u201d read one huge banner.\n\nThe head of one of the protesting groups, Veterans\u2019 Brotherhood, said Zelenskiy held a closed-door meeting with nationalist groups last week to try to explain his position and calm tensions, but claimed the president said he has \u201cno plan.\u201d\n\nWhile the nationalist groups gathered at key sites in Kyiv, at other spots in the city families with strollers just enjoyed the holiday, eating ice cream and basking in an unusually warm autumn day.\n\n___\n\nLynn Berry in Kyiv contributed to this report.", "description": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Brandishing red flares and shouting \"glory to Ukraine,\" thousands of far-right and nationalist activists marched Monday through Kyiv,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/14/67165e_ukraine-protests-74567-members-nationalist-movements-light-flares-rally-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
