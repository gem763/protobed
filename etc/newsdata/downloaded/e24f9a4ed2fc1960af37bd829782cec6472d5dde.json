The financial sector has led the charge, as millions of investors put their hard-earned dollars into a plethora of funds that span across asset classes.\n\nUnfortunately, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been making that process more difficult than it needs to be by strictly enforcing the opaque \u201cShare Class Selection Disclosure Initiative\u201d (SCSD) first announced in February 2018. Instead of heavy-handed enforcement, the SEC should focus on a transparent rule-making progress that creates clear rules across the financial sector.\n\nUnder the SCSD initiative, the agency has been targeting firms that allegedly failed to disclose to consumers that they had been moved to mutual fund share classes with higher fees when share classes of the same fund with lower fees were available. Already, the SEC has settled nearly eighty cases with investment firms, who must now refund their consumers more than $125 million for their disclosure failures. Recent regulatory actions have targeted firms that have already self-reported under the SCSD Initiative, resulting in millions of dollars in litigation fees inevitably passed along to consumers.\n\nThe bedrock of SCSD is voluntary compliance. The SEC \u201cwill agree not to recommend financial penalties against investment advisers who self-report violations of the federal securities laws relating to certain mutual fund share class selection issues and promptly return money to harmed clients.\u201d This seemingly light-touch approach has led Chairman Clayton to previously argue that SCSD is not in fact regulation.\n\nBut as with most regulatory action, the federal government has resorted to a carrot-and-stick approach with targeted firms. In December, dually-registered investment advisers and investment advisers with broker-dealer affiliates that failed to self-report were given document requests by the SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division, forcing companies to expend valuable time and resources gathering data.\n\nIn pursuing these costly regulations, the SEC refuses to allow the market to work in weeding out bad actors. For example, the agency initiated actions against American Portfolios Advisors and PPS Advisors for allegedly selecting costly mutual fund share classes for clients without telling them that cheaper options were available. In the ultra-competitive financial sector, companies are already bending over backwards to advertise the lowest fees to consumers. Sure, there will be short-sighted companies that trick companies into paying needless 12b-1 fees, but these firms are exceptions to the rule. In their 2019 U.S. Fund Fee Study, Morningstar concluded, \u201cfees hit a record low this year, and investors are paying roughly half as much to own funds as they did two decades ago.\u201d\n\nThe SEC should focus its resources on the most egregious violations of consumer trust such as when firms fail to disclose conflicts of interest. To get the rules of the game right for millions of firms and consumers, the agency should do its due diligence, launching listening tours nationwide and insisting on roundtables with foremost financial experts. The SEC sought this kind of consensus when creating conduct standards for broker-dealers in 2018, and building on these rules will require even more feedback from stakeholders.\n\nPushing for greater SCSD enforcement resources, as the SEC has been doing, will fail to alleviate a problem best left to market forces to solve. Chairman Clayton correctly told Congress that Main Street investors will \u201cnot assess our work by the number or percentage of rules and initiatives we complete, but rather will be looking at what our efforts substantively do for them.\u201d The SEC can fulfill this duty to investors by pursuing a streamlined, transparent rulemaking process, fueling growth and prosperity for millions of consumers.", "description": "Across the federal government, more restrained rulemaking and streamlined regulations have led to one of the longest economic expansions in U.S. history.
