I'd love to know if he's got the famous Markle nose.\"\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE'S FATHER SPEAKS OUT AFTER BIRTH OF ROYAL BABY\n\n\"Sometimes I get the feeling people think I don't love my daughter,\" he said. \"I do love her very much. I would love nothing more than to put a picture of Archie in a frame and place it beside the one of Meghan ... Of course I'm disappointed not to see Archie. I had hoped becoming a mother would mellow Meghan and she would reach out.\"\n\nThe interview came as a bit of a surprise, as Thomas has kept a low profile for months, but he said he did so only to keep the former \"Suits\" star from getting too stressed during her pregnancy.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE'S ESTRANGED HALF-BROTHER BEGS HER TO REUNITE THEIR FAMILY\n\nROYAL FAMILY PLACES MEGHAN MARKLE'S ESTRANGED SISTER ON 'FIXATED PERSONS' LIST\n\n\"There was never any problem between Meghan and me until recently,\" he said. \"I've stayed quiet because Meghan was pregnant with Archie but I'm speaking out now because they and their PR people are continuing to ghost me out of her life.\"\n\nHe added that he sent Duchess Meghan, 38, a birthday card in August through her Los Angeles-based financial adviser but he didn't know if she ever received it.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE AT 'WIT'S END' OVER FATHER'S BETRAYAL\n\nThe father-daughter duo became estranged after Thomas arranged for a paparazzi photo shoot leading up to her royal wedding to Prince Harry, which Thomas said he did to improve his public image from that of a seemingly \"homeless\" guy.\n\n\"It was a huge mistake. I wanted to apologize to the Royal Family publicly but Meghan and Harry told me not to,\" he said of the mishap. \"So I texted Jason Knauf, who was Harry and Meghan's then press secretary, and he asked me what I'd like to say? I said I wanted to apologize to the Queen and the Royal Family and that I meant no harm. That apology never came out. I don't know why.\"\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE PLAYING A 'DANGEROUS GAME' WITH ESTRANGED FATHER, ROYAL EXPERT SAYS\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE'S ESTRANGED SISTER SLAMS HER AS 'WEALTHY NARCISSIST'\n\nThomas missed the wedding, reportedly due to suffering two heart attacks, leading to his hospitalization. He said he heard neither from Duchess Meghan nor from Harry after the harrowing cardiac episodes, though Duchess Meghan previously wrote in a letter to her father (that he shared with the press) that she'd reached out to him.\n\n\"All I'd like to ask people is, 'How would you feel if your father had a heart attack?' I texted them from my hospital bed and told them where I was,\" he said. \"I have the texts to prove it. Yet never once has Meghan ever asked me how I'm doing. Not then, not since.\"\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE'S FATHER SAYS HE HUNG UP ON PRINCE HARRY DURING CALL ABOUT STAGED PAPARAZZI PICS\n\nThomas also took issue with Duchess Meghan's claims that she relied solely on financial aid to pay for her college education at Northwestern University, saying, \"I'm sorry but that is completely untrue. I paid every penny of her tuition and I have the bank statements to prove it. I paid for her trips to Spain and England. I paid for her internship in Argentina.\"\n\nThomas, an award-winning lighting director on film and television, said it was a \"point of pride\" to pay for his daughter's education.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE\u2019S HALF-SISTER SAYS SHE WILL RELEASE TWO TELL-ALL BOOKS, WILL \u2018HOLD NOTHING BACK\u2019\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE\u2019S FATHER SAYS HE\u2019S \u2018VERY UPSET\u2019 BY ALLEGED KATE MIDDLETON FEUD: \u2018THEY SHOULD PUT THEIR DIFFERENCES ASIDE\u2019\n\n\"Meghan is saying she wants nothing to do with me and she worked her way through college all by herself,\" he griped. \"I haven't said anything about it, but I'm sure reporters are checking at Northwestern to see who paid her way through school. She cannot change history.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I'm sick of the lies. I'm sick of being vilified and shut out of their lives. I always upheld my responsibilities as a father. Meghan's comments about paying her way through college are offensive to me.\"\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE'S ESTRANGED HALF-SISTER SAYS SHE SHOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR FATHER'S HELP WITH COLLEGE EDUCATION\n\nThomas also criticized his daughter and son-in-law for their use of private jets despite their proclamations of environmental consciousness and concern for climate change, likening their alleged hypocrisy to their treatment of him.\n\n\"I don't think it's racist. I think it's a shame that Meghan and Harry say one thing and act another way,\" he said. \"Whoever is advising them isn't doing a great job.\"\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE HAS NOT RECONCILED WITH HER FATHER\n\n\"I feel sorry for them in a way because they brought this on themselves. You can't say one thing and do another,\" he said. \"Everyone raves about how gracious and wonderful they are, but they are not wonderful to their own family. That's hypocritical. You can't portray yourself as being charitable and bringing people together and then ghost your own father and your entire family. Their treatment of me has left a lot to be desired.\"\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE'S FATHER SLAMS REPORTS THAT HE'S IGNORING HER\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE HAS 'MOVED ON' FROM DIFFICULT DAD, REPORT SAYS\n\n\"I've still never met my son-in-law. Why couldn't Prince Harry have got on a plane and flown to see me to ask for her hand? He obviously has no problem getting on private jets,\" he said. \"If he wants to come and see me on a private jet, there's an airport near here in Tijuana, and San Diego is just over the border. There are dozens of commercial flights from England to San Diego and Los Angeles every day.\"\n\nDespite his flurry of criticisms and insults, Thomas said he still wanted to mend fences with Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry someday.\n\nTHOMAS MARKLE WANTED TO FLY TO LONDON TO MAKE PEACE WITH DUCHESS MEGHAN\n\n\"I don't want anything from Meghan or Harry but I'm not going to shut up until the whole truth is out there. I will continue to contradict anything said about me that isn't true,\" he said. \"I have to stand up for myself. I'm going to carry on speaking and I'm not going to shut up. No father deserves this kind of abuse when he's been that good to his daughter. Ask anyone who knows us both. I've been very kind and generous to my daughter.\"\n\nHe added, \"Everybody thinks I had nothing to do with her after [her mother] Doria and I divorced. The truth is she lived with me most of the time until she went off to college. I believe all family differences can be resolved and I believe that can still happen for me, Meghan and Harry.\"\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE INVITED TO ESTRANGED HALF-BROTHER'S WEDDING AFTER HE URGED PRINCE HARRY NOT TO MARRY HER\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE AND HER DIFFICULT DAD: WHAT LESSON DOES THIS ROYAL MESS HAVE FOR THE REST OF US?\n\nConsidering Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan's feud with her family came after her father and estranged half-sister, Samantha, began speaking to the media, reconciliation may be unlikely.\n\nIn a documentary released in April \u2014 about a month before Archie's birth \u2014 royal expert Duncan Larcombe speculated that Thomas would never meet the child.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think for a moment that Thomas Markle will ever be able to meet his grandson or granddaughter,\u201d said Larcombe, one of the experts consulted in the documentary \u201cMeghan & Harry: A Royal Baby Story.\u201d\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE'S FATHER, HALF-SISTER SLAM GEORGE CLOONEY FOR DEFENDING DUCHESS\n\nIn February, Thomas published the letter Duchess Meghan sent him after the royal wedding begging him not to speak with the media anymore.\n\n\u201cIf you love me, as you tell the press you do, please stop,\u201d Markle wrote. \u201cPlease allow us to live our lives in peace. Please stop lying, please stop creating so much pain, please stop exploiting my relationship with my husband. I realize you are so far down this rabbit hole that you feel (or may not feel) there\u2019s no way out, but if you take a moment to pause I think you\u2019ll see that being able to live with a clear conscience is more valuable than any payment in the world.\u201d\n\nTHOMAS MARKLE SAYS DUCHESS MEGHAN IS 'TERRIFIED' WITH ROYAL FAMILY\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE'S FATHER SAYS HE HAND-DELIVERED LETTER TO HER MOTHER BEGGING FOR RECONCILIATION\n\nMarkle also claimed she never received messages from Thomas regarding his reported heart attack, which he said took place just before her nuptials.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve told the press that you called me to say you weren\u2019t coming to the wedding \u2014 that didn\u2019t happen because you never called,\u201d Markle wrote. \u201cI have only ever loved, protected, and defended you, offering whatever financial support I could, worrying about your health. So the week of the wedding to hear about you having a heart attack through a tabloid was horrifying. I called and texted\u2026 I begged you to accept help \u2014 we sent someone to your home\u2026 and instead of speaking to me to accept this or any help, you stopped answering your phone and chose to only speak to tabloids.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, Markle also addressed Thomas\u2019 relationship with her half-sister.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI pleaded with you to stop reading the tabloids,\u201d wrote Markle. \u201cOn a daily basis, you fixated and clicked on the lies they were writing about me, especially those manufactured by your other daughter, who I barely know. You watched me silently suffer at the hands of your vicious lies, I crumbled inside.\u201d\n\nFox News' Stephanie Nolasco contributed to this report.", "description": "Meghan Markle's estranged father is begging the Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry to reconcile with him so he can meet his grandson \u2014 but he also slammed them for their alleged hypocrisy and dishonesty at the same time.", "authors": ["Jessica Sager"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/meghan-markle-father-thomas-markle-prince-harry.jpg"}
