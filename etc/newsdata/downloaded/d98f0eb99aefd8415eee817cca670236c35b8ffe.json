Her and Koch (left) participated in the first ever all-female spacewalk\n\n'This is the first time that there's been two women outside at the same time.'\n\nThe first woman to complete a spacewalk was Russian astronaut Svetlana Yevgenyevna Savitskaya in 1984 \u2013 a total of 15 women have ever spacewalked, including Meir and Koch.\n\nRegardless of the blunder, Koch and Meir will still go in history books for the first all-female spacewalk.\n\nAn all-woman spacewalk had been planned for March but one of the astronauts was replaced by a man because her space suit didn't fit.\n\nAn all-woman spacewalk had been planned for March but one of the astronauts was replaced by a man because her space suit didn't fit. However, Meir (left) and Koch (right) were able to complete the spacewalk and make history\n\nThe first American female spacewalker, who carried out her own mission 35 years ago, Kathy Sullivan, said she was delighted by today's milestone.\n\nANASA spokesperson said: 'Our achievements provide inspiration to students around the world, proving that hard work can lead you to great heights, and all students should be able to see themselves in those achievements.'\n\nKoch can be seen during today's space walk with a red band around her space suit leg\n\nNASA astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir exiting the International Space Station\n\nJessica Meir's helmet cam as she moved along the ISS to the work station\n\nNASA, astronauts Christina Koch, right, and, Jessica Meir pose for a photo on the International Space Station\n\nNASA makes history as two women astronauts embark on the first ever all-female spacewalk from the ISS\n\nThe pair exited the International Space Station at 07:38am ET (12:38pm BST)\n\nThe planned all-woman spacewalk in March was called off because astronaut Ann McClain needed a medium spacesuit but only a large was available.\n\nDue to safety issues with the fit she did not participate and man took her place, making today the revised date for the landmark mission.\n\n'We must never accept a risk that can instead be mitigated,' she said on Twitter after the event.
