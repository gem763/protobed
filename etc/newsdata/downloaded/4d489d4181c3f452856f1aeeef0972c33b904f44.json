Spiller was the critical recruit to help start the Clemson dynasty", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE USA TODAY Sports' Paul Myerberg breaks down the latest Amway Coaches Poll. USA TODAY\n\nFour losses in five games to end his freshman season in 2006 made C.J. Spiller consider leaving Clemson and transferring to Florida, where second-year coach Urban Meyer was building a powerhouse at a program located just a short drive from Spiller's hometown of Lake Butler.\n\nSpiller brought his concerns to Dabo Swinney, then an assistant coach and the point man on Spiller's high-profile recruitment. For the second time, Swinney had to convinced Spiller to commit to Clemson. He responded to Spiller's worries with a question: Why would you go to someone else's backyard, meaning a Florida program loaded with NFL-bound talent, when you can stay here and have your own?\n\n\"It kind of stuck with me,\" Spiller said. \"You normally don\u2019t think like that as a young player. When he said that I knew it was meant for me to stay.\"\n\nClemson running back C.J. Spiller tries to avoid the tackle of Florida State defensive lineman Kevin McNeil during their game in 2009.

While he'll largely avoid reaching out during the season \u2014 he knows how demanding the season can be said, he said \u2014 Spiller spoke with Etienne last summer about continuing to work on catching passes, since NFL teams will want to see whether the junior is comfortable serving in that role out of the backfield.\n\nIn hindsight, Swinney told USA TODAY Sports this summer, no single recruit has been more vital to Clemson's development from ACC bridesmaid to Bowl Subdivision powerhouse than Spiller \u2014 not to mention as a program capable of out-recruiting even Alabama.\n\nClemson currently has the top-rated class in college football, with verbal commitments from the nation's top prospect, defensive lineman Bryan Bresee, and another nine prospects ranked among the nation's top 100 recruits by 247Sports.com.\n\nSpiller played a large part in opening the floodgates, giving Swinney the confidence to chase after the best of the best in the Tigers' recruiting footprint. Of the 28 five-star recruits Clemson has signed since 2000, according to the 247Sports' composite rankings, all but five have come since Swinney was named interim head coach midway through the 2008 season.\n\nNo five-star commitment has been more unexpected than Spiller, however. For one, he committed to Clemson without experiencing a home game at Memorial Stadium, the rough equivalent of purchasing a new car without taking a peek under the hood. In his case, Spiller's first Death Valley experience came in his freshman debut \u2014 he accounted for 35 yards of total offense as the Tigers kicked off the 2006 season with a 54-6 win against Florida Atlantic.\n\nStranger still, however, was the simple fact that Spiller committed to Clemson at all. Ranked as one of the top running backs and overall prospects in his recruiting cycle, Spiller had visited Southern California and Miami (Fla.), lived within a stone's throw of Florida's campus and grew up cheering for Florida State. In comparison, the Tigers were the outlier among some of the biggest and most established names in the sport.\n\nSpiller's decision to attend Clemson can in large part be attributed to Swinney, with whom Spiller quickly struck \"a father-son relationship,\" he said. He also had a feeling: Clemson was the only school where \"something just clicked\" during his official visit.\n\n\"Clemson wasn\u2019t the sexiest program when I was coming out,\" Spiller said. \"At the end of the day, it just came down to a comfort level. I was never the type of guy that got caught up in all the smoke, all the nonsense with the uniforms and buildings and whatever that might be, because that stuff meant nothing to me.\"", "description": "Before Clemson became a football dynasty, it was the recruitment of C.J.
