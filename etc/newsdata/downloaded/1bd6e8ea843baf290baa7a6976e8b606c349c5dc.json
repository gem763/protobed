Every. Damn. Thing.\n\nFrom your mental health to the oil in your skin, from your appetite to your sleep quality \u2013 where you are in your cycle has a big impact on how you feel. So it\u2019s no surprise that it can change the way you workout.\n\nAccording to the experts, there are points in your menstrual cycle that essentially make you superhuman. You\u2019ll be stronger, faster, and able to handle more endurance.\n\nSimilarly there will be times when working out will feel like a total slog, you\u2019ll be sluggish, fatigued and more prone to soreness.\n\nIf you have a period, you\u2019re always in one of the four phases of your menstrual cycle.\n\nThese phases are governed by hormonal changes, the two major players being oestrogen and progesterone, and your hormone levels will absolutely impact your mood and energy for exercise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot everyone has a 28-day cycle and the influence of hormones on the brain and body is complex, so tracking how you feel across each phase of your cycle is key.\n\nBut to get you started, lingerie company Pour Moi has teamed up with period coach Claire Baker, to create a fitness regime for every stage of your cycle:\n\nMenstruation, approximately days 1 \u2013 5\n\nBest for: Yoga, Pilates, stretches, meditation, walking, slow and controlled body work (e.g. tai chi, balance and flexibility exercises), low impact cardio (e.g. cross trainer, cycling, swimming)\n\nDuring the first stage of your cycle \u2013 when you\u2019re actually on your period \u2013 hormones are at their lowest levels for the entire month, so it\u2019s okay if you feel sleepy this week or less inspired to make it to the gym.\n\nLow-impact exercise like walking or gentle stretching can help to alleviate period pain and discomfort.\n\nAvoid strenuous exercise that pushes your body to its limits, especially on those first couple of heavy flow days.\n\nListen to your body and give yourself permission to rest when you feel you need to.\n\nLow-impact exercise can help to alleviate period pain (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nPre-ovulation, approximately days 6 \u2013 12\n\nBest for: Strength training, CrossFit, circuits, sprint training, boxing, aerobic classes, Zumba or high energy dance classes, Bikram yoga\n\nAs your period comes to an end, you\u2019ll likely notice a surge in motivation to work out.\n\nAs oestrogen and serotonin (the \u2018feel-good\u2019 hormone) steadily increase, you may feel less inclined to hit the snooze button and more inspired to book an early morning HIIT class.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChannel this energy with exercises that will wake you up and give you a big boost.\n\nYour ability to build muscle increases in this stage too, so throw a few strength training sessions into your routine this week.\n\nReminder for people with breasts According to the NHS, breasts have a 15 cm range of movement when running, with the multi-directional swaying causing pain and irreversible stretching. High-impact workouts require a super supportive sports bra, and a good rule of thumb is to use underwired sports bras for consistent, high intensity movements such as jogging, cross fit and team sports.\n\nOvulation and post-ovulation, approximately days 13 \u2013 20\n\nBest for: Hitting the gym with a friend, group classes, combat training, team sport training (netball, football, rugby, hockey, kickboxing), running, resistance training\n\nKeep up that strength training.\n\nThe combination of oestrogen and testosterone at ovulation can help to increase motivation, confidence and energy levels, so you might feel more inspired to work out with friends, your partner, or in a group workout class.\n\nAfter ovulation, oestrogen dips and progesterone increases, so it\u2019s normal to feel a change in energy and motivation.\n\nTrack your cycle and make a note of when you feel this dip (around day 17 in a 28 day cycle), so you\u2019re aware and can be prepared.\n\nWhich is the best day of your cycle to try for a PB? Pre-ovulation, actual ovulation and post-ovulation are the key stages for trying for a PB, with higher levels of serotonin and testosterone in your body. If you\u2019re looking for more energy and confidence, crucial for PB achievements, go for somewhere around days 10-15 of your cycle. However, your body is your own and we all work and tick differently. And it\u2019s still highly possible that you can get your strongest fitness performance during your menstruum and pre-menstruum stages. After all, football superstar Rose Lavelle scored the goal that shot the women\u2019s US team into World Cup victory \u2014 the day before her period began! At a professional sport level, women\u2019s cycles play a huge part in their training, just as much as prioritising diet, nutrition, recovery and sleep. So, whilst your period doesn\u2019t have to dictate your workouts, you can use your cycle stage knowledge to up your self-care and help maximize your fitness performance before your period starts again.\n\nPre-menstruum, approximately days 22 \u2013 28\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest for: Bodyweight training, water aerobics, active stretching, yoga, kettlebells, rowing machine, TRX, elliptical machine, Pilates, swimming\n\nProgesterone is the dominant hormone after ovulation and this soothing hormone is less interested in early morning kickboxing classes and more into candlelit yin yoga.\n\nProgesterone increases your core body temperature, so if you feel more puffed than usual, don\u2019t stress \u2013 it could just be hormones affecting your heart and breathing rates.\n\nIt\u2019s likely your motivation to exercise won\u2019t be at its highest this week, but moving your body can help to process any pre-menstrual emotions that arise.\n\nFor those of us with breats, hormonal changes before your period can make them tender, so be sure to wear a sports bra that\u2019s supportive and comfortable.\n\nAn ideal choice for lower impact exercise such as yoga, pilates and rowing is a non-wired sports bra.\n\nMORE: How to stop \u2018cancel anxiety\u2019 \u2013 the guilt that comes with blowing off your plans\n\nMORE: The unexpected ways pollution can affect your hormones and reproductive system\n\nMORE: The fitness industry is overwhelmingly white \u2013 and that needs to change\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Where you are in your cycle can affect your strength, recovery and motivation - here are the best workouts for every stage.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/squat-8993_1571732262.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
