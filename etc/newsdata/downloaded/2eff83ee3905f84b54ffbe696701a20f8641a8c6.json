He stressed that the U.S. wants to avoid military action in favor of diplomacy.\n\n\u201cThe whole world understands that Iran is the bad actor, they are the evil force in the region,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cI hope this week here in New York the world will come together to push back against this and convince the Iranian leadership this behavior is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nReferring to the attack on oil fields in Saudi Arabia last week, which Washington and Riyadh blamed on Iran, Mr. Pompeo added, \u201cThis is the world\u2019s responsibility to respond [to] these state-on-state acts of war.\u201d\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani, criticizing a new U.S.-led coalition guarding regional shipping, urged Western nations Sunday to leave the security of the Persian Gulf to an alliance led by Tehran. He also promised to unveil a Middle East peace plan this week at the United Nations.\n\nMr. Trump said he is open to hearing that plan but added that no meetings are scheduled with Iranian leaders at the U.N. He told reporters that \u201ca lot of progress\u201d has been made on Iran in recent days, apparently referring to fresh U.S. sanctions on Tehran.\n\nSEE ALSO: Iran threatens \u2018full destruction of any aggressor\u2019 after U.S. deploys more troops to Middle East\n\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s role in confronting Tehran will be even more prominent since the departure of White House National Security Adviser John R. Bolton, a hard-liner whom the president fired two weeks ago. Among his differences with the president, Mr. Bolton reportedly disagreed sharply with Mr. Trump\u2019s decision in June to call off a missile strike against Iranian forces in retaliation for Iran\u2019s downing of a U.S. Navy surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nMr. Bolton was replaced by Robert O\u2019Brien, formerly the president\u2019s top hostage negotiator. Another key player for the U.S. side, U.N. Ambassador Kelly Craft, is new to the post. The Senate confirmed her on July 31.\n\nDuring the U.N. sessions, Mr. Pompeo will convene a meeting of the Middle East Strategic Alliance \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman \u2014 plus Jordan. The threat of Iran is expected to be high on the agenda.\n\nDemocrats and some foreign policy analysts say Mr. Trump\u2019s job of building an anti-Iran coalition is more difficult after withdrawing the U.S. from the six-nation Iran nuclear deal last year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having difficulty with our European allies to get the kind of support we need,\u201d said Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, Maryland Democrat and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cBy pulling out of the nuclear agreement, it\u2019s the view of Europe this is an American problem rather than an international problem. We isolated the United States rather than isolating Iran.\u201d\n\nMr. Cardin, speaking on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d said Mr. Trump \u201cneeds to \u2026 get an international coalition to continue to work against Iran\u2019s support of terrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur job is to isolate Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cIran is the bad actor.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also will be missing one of his most fervent Middle Eastern allies: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who canceled his trip to New York after inconclusive election results last week.\n\n\u201cWe have a General Assembly meeting where the president really needs allies on Iran,\u201d said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIt\u2019s clear [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin isn\u2019t going to help him. Prime Minister Netanyahu won\u2019t be there. He needs to win over traditional allies to do what traditional allies do: to band together against common threats.\u201d\n\nMr. Alterman said the president is taking a different approach to the U.N. gathering than his first appearance in 2017, when he threatened in a speech that the U.S. would \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea unilaterally if necessary.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump was convinced that he could do much better than his predecessors by taking Iran on by himself,\u201d Mr. Alterman said. \u201cThe events of last weekend suggest that Iran is not following the playbook he\u2019d like them to be following.\u201d\n\nWith Mr. Bolton\u2019s departure, Mr. Alterman called Mr. Pompeo \u201cthe undisputed king of the president\u2019s foreign policy world.\u201d\n\nThe administration late last week announced another round of economic sanctions on Iran in response to the attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities. Iran denies it is responsible for the attack, and Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen claim they carried out the strikes.\n\nWhile the U.S. and Saudi Arabia made clear that they believe Iran is responsible for the attacks, neither country has explicitly said that the rockets and drones used to target the facilities were fired from inside Iran.\n\n\u201cOur mission set has been very clear. President Trump would like to have a diplomatic solution,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said. \u201cThat\u2019s the task in front of us. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been aiming for for a little over two years now.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said economic sanctions on Iran\u2019s national bank go \u201cright to the top.\u201d\n\n\u201cHighest sanctions ever imposed on a country,\u201d the president said Friday. \u201cI think the sanctions work and the military would work.\u201d\n\nThe president said Iran could be a \u201cgreat country, a rich country.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they are choosing to go a different way,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will be very sorry for that choice.\u201d\n\nIranian officials are going into the U.N. meetings accusing the U.S. of reneging on its nuclear deal.\n\n\u201cThe United States has been reluctant to engage in what is required,\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nHe offered this analogy for Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the nuclear deal: \u201cI buy a building from you, and somebody inherits your company from you the next year and he tells you, \u2018I didn\u2019t sell that building to you. I need a higher price and [will give you] a worse building.\u2019 Would you buy it?\n\n\u201cPresident Trump inherited a government from another administration that was legally elected as United States government, and that [nuclear] agreement has been endorsed by the [U.N.] Security Council,\u201d Mr. Zarif said.\n\nA senior administration official said confronting Iran\u2019s \u201cescalatory violence is going to be a theme of the conference.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe welcome this opportunity to consult with a broad range of partners and allies on our collective response,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember the attack on the Saudi infrastructure really is an attack on everyone who consumes that energy.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, who arrived in New York on Sunday night for a rare stay at Trump Tower, will start his U.N. business Monday by hosting a \u201cglobal call\u201d to protect religious freedom.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a stunning 83% of the world\u2019s population which now live in nations where religious freedom is threatened or even banned,\u201d the administration official said. \u201cThe president is calling on all world leaders to begin to not just talk about it, but to take action to acknowledge it and to move forward.\u201d\n\n\u2981 Tom Howell Jr. contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
