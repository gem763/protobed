Her credit-card case had gone missing.\n\nThere had been a pistarckle with the cabbie who brought her to the rendezvous. The rise of phone-a-cars has made rude cabbies almost a thing of the past; the pressure of competition makes them models of congeniality, doing U-turns on avenues in order to nab a fare. This cabbie, however, was a holdover from the bad old days. Pay with credit card, he insisted. Your machine does not work, my wife told him. Pay with credit card! Your machine does not work . . . Eventually my wife did what one should have done at first but realizes only in the spirit of the staircase and gave the man ignorant of his own equipment cash. But, after she and he had parted ways and she came to examine her purse more collectedly, she saw that her credit-card case was not there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy wife and I are still plastic people, caught between the past of bills and coins (coins with some intrinsic value, no less: remember silver half dollars?) and the future of smartphone scanning. Our wallets swell with the cards that get us through the day, or we carry special cases to hold them. In addition to credit cards there may be: the driver\u2019s license (also now the sitter\u2019s license \u2014 you need one to pass by the Cerberus who allows you to sit in an airplane); the gym card (how else will we exercise? thoughts are heavy, but not weight-bearing); the bank card (necessary for getting those still-necessary freshets of bills, though not of course coins); other plastic stuff. Add them all up, there can be more of them than in a hand of seven-card stud. When they are suddenly lost, you can look forward to an afternoon of calling the companies that issued them to stipulate that the living-room set bought suddenly in eastern Pennsylvania was not actually bought by you.\n\nWhen I arrived at the coffeehouse I did the expected things, useless but calming. Are you sure it isn\u2019t in your purse? Can I look too? Once the credit-card case\u2019s non-thereness was established, my wife came up with a useful thing, a plan: She would wait until the following morning to make the round of phone calls, in case someone should find her case and contact her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe newspapers regularly run stories about cabbies who have retrieved and returned mislaid keepsakes, authors\u2019 manuscripts, musicians\u2019 Stradivarii. My wife\u2019s cabbie did not seem like the man to turn patron saint of lost things. But her instinct to wait turned out to be correct. That evening she got a call from a woman who lived downtown, who had found her card case lying on the sidewalk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy wife\u2019s phone number is not on any of her cards, but matching a name to a number (and blood type, and criminal history) is child\u2019s play these days. She returned the call; a time frame was agreed on. Together we went to my wife\u2019s savior\u2019s address (only minutes away from our apartment building, though it was on a block I don\u2019t remember ever having walked). My wife, as all the saved should do, had brought a token of thanks: a bouquet. Picking it had been a matter of discrimination. Tulips: boring. Dyed flowers: please! She settled on saffron roses. Credit-card case, flowers, and kind words were exchanged.\n\nUp in the country the following weekend, we left the bus that brought us from the city. A holiday loomed, several buses had arrived at the station at once, passengers waited in long lines to embark on their vacations. My wife went ahead to get a table in the small bus-station coffeehouse \u2014 how would we live without that beverage? \u2014 while I grabbed our bags from the bus\u2019s hold. We performed our afternoon-of-arrival routine: nibbled a late breakfast, shopped, had a more substantial lunch; drove over the ridge, shopped again at the U-Pick, arrived at our country home at last. There was an email: One of the bags I had taken belonged to someone else. The woman now in possession of ours was in a bus station farther up the line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mistake: The bags were identical, but in my haste I had not looked for the bright red ribbon that my wife had attached to ours to prevent just such switches from occurring. My responsibility: After a quick look at the map (I still have hard-copy road atlases \u2014 me, and Chingachgook), I drove to the other bus station to set all in order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is a familiar drive. It is a drive through history: My destination city was briefly the capital of the state during the Revolution, until the British burned it; another town the road bisects has a Dutch graveyard and a street of stone houses, including one where George Washington slept. Rip Van Winkle and the Headless Horseman must have traveled it many a time. I ticked off the landmarks as I passed them: the U-Pick; the roller rink; the deserted house, built of fieldstone, burned out by a bad chimney; the farm stand that used to display a pumpkin cannon at this time of year, vacant now for the last several. As I approached my target, a cat\u2019s cradle of turnoffs, then the second bus station. I phoned the woman I was to meet; she was waiting inside. We traded bags, and I returned in the gloaming the way I had come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat I drew from this were three old saws, all partly true: City dwellers are often decent folk, whatever our reputation. And, when you receive a good deed, exert yourself for the next person down the line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, keep an eye on your possessions. Decency and exertion are nice, but don\u2019t count on them.", "description": "My wife\u2019s credit-card case is returned; next weekend, I returned a bag to it\u2019s rightful owner.", "authors": ["Richard Brookhiser", "Ramesh Ponnuru", "Jay Nordlinger", "John Hirschauer", "Charles C.
