I\u2019m not quite sure what I see.\n\nGary Neville was critical of the Brazilian (Picture: Fantasista/Getty)\n\n\u2018Essentially for \u00a350million, you\u2019d like to fit into one of those categories.\u2019\n\nArsenal hero Martin Keown also branded the Brazilian a \u2018joke\u2019 after United\u2019s 1-0 defeat to Newcastle but Fred is not shying away from the critics, especially those who have enjoyed great success in the famous red shirt of Manchester.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They are within their rights, they\u2019ve won many titles with this club. We have to shut up and work on the pitch,\u2019 Fred told Esporte Interativo.\n\n\u2018Some critics are pointless \u2014 but many can offer me lessons. I like to read what people are saying about my performances. With that, I can try to get better.\n\n\u2018Every day when I arrive at the training ground, when I see those big letters with the name of the club, I pinch myself.\n\n\u2018So I know this club is gigantic. I like to read about its history, best players and historical moments.\n\nMartin Keown suggested Fred was a \u2018joke\u2019 (Picture: Fantasista/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018It hasn\u2019t been great times for us \u2014 our rivals are winning titles and we\u2019re not even in the Champions League. It makes our fans sad and I feel sad as well.\n\n\u2018This club deserves silverware and we\u2019re going to fight to get better. We have to put United back in the place it should never have left.\u2019\n\nFred didn\u2019t feature for Solskjaer\u2019s side until September after arriving back to pre-season late following his summer wedding but he feels \u2018more settled\u2019 now in English football.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I started later than most of the squad so they were ahead of me,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018Now I\u2019m feeling way better and more settled. I\u2019m sure this season will be better for me and for United.\u2019\n\nOn his manager Solskjaer \u2013 who is coming under increasing pressure \u2013 he said: \u2018It\u2019s the beginning of his work \u2014 even Ferguson had difficult times in his first years. I\u2019m positive everything is going to get better.\u2019\n\nMORE: Manchester United coaches fearful over club\u2019s young stars during crisis\n\nMORE: Ed Woodward losing patience with Solskjaer as Manchester United squad question his ability", "description": "Fred has been a victim of heavy criticism this season, but the Manchester United midfielder insists he is trying to learn from the words of those who are questioning his...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1174221166_1570523057.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
