Two of them were injured in the first 20 minutes leading to uncontested scrums.\n\nThe Springboks scored seven tries in all for a bonus point. They would have taken just a win to keep them in the competition before kickoff but weren\u2019t going to turn down the chance when Italy went down to 14 men with nearly the entire second half to play.\n\nElectric right wing Cheslin Kolbe scored two of the tries, hooker Bongi Mbonambi one, and center Lukhanyo Am intercepted for the bonus-point score. Left wing Makazole Mapimpi also had one, Italy gifted replacement lock RG Snyman the sixth, and hooker Malcolm Marx was over in a rolling maul after the final hooter.\n\nItaly is just about out of the World Cup. It needs to beat defending champion New Zealand in its last pool game to have a chance of making the quarters.\n\nSouth Africa is just about through with underdog Canada to play.\n\nSouth Africa dominated up front early in a game billed as likely to be decided up front. The Boks pack buckled the Italians in the first scrum and marched them back in the second. But South Africa\u2019s scrum dominance disappeared midway through the half when the game went to uncontested scrums. That\u2019s because Italy prop Simone Ferrari went off injured in the first minute and his replacement, Marco Riccioni, also later left injured. Italy had no specialist tighthead left.\n\nThe Springboks\u2019 big men found other ways to dominate, making big charges, being effective in the lineout, and scoring two tries from rolling mauls.\n\nKolbe jinked through Italy\u2019s defense for the first in the sixth minute. The forwards took Mbonambi over for the second.\n\nItaly\u2019s only points came through flyhalf Tommaso Allan\u2019s early penalty, but Italy tested South Africa\u2019s defense in the first half.\n\nLovotti\u2019s red card on Vermeulen _ after Italy nearly scored the first points of the second half _ allowed the Boks to pour it on.\n\nKolbe\u2019s second came when he collected a cross-kick from Pollard.\n\nAm\u2019s try was the result of a crazy, helter skelter passage of play when Italy intercepted deep in its half and broke all the way downfield. The teams both lost possession multiple times in the move before Am intercepted and went 50 meters back to score untouched.\n\nMapimpi also collected a cross-kick, this time on the left wing from the boot of fullback Willie le Roux.\n\nItaly fullback Matteo Minozzi handed the sixth to Snyman on a plate when he was being tackled into touch by Kolbe near his tryline and tried to hurl a pass infield with five minutes to go. The ball fell for Snyman to scoop it up and dive over.\n\nReplacement hooker Marx scored the final one well after the final hooter sounded. South Africa\u2019s forwards were eager for more. Pollard\u2019s missed conversion in the last act prevented it being 50 points.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "South Africa won big in a game it had to win, trouncing 14-man Italy 49-3 in Shizuoka on Friday to stay in the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gerald Imray"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
