About 71 of these are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019, it said.\n\nGeneral employee knowledge about anti-money laundering has also improved, Swedbank said. \u201cIn the bank\u2019s reply to the financial supervisory authority\u2019s verification letter on Sept. 16, it was noted that many of the key observations made by the financial supervisory authority correspond to the bank\u2019s own observations,\u201d Swedbank said in a statement. \u201cSwedbank continues to cooperate with and provide all information that the authorities ask for.\u201d Swedbank came under scrutiny in February after a Swedish broadcaster reported that billions of dollars of illicit funds may have passed through its Estonian branch in a link to money laundering at Danske Bank A/S. A leadership shuffle has since followed at the Swedish lender, where a new chief executive and a permanent compliance officer have been installed in recent months. Sweden\u2019s FSA\u2014known as the Finansinspektionen\u2014will now consider whether the matter is subject to sanctions or not, Swedbank said. Estonia\u2019s financial supervisory authority has also opened a sanctioning case with regard to Swedbank.
