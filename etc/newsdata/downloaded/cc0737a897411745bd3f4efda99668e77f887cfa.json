With 99.99 percent of the ballots counted on Thursday night, he supposedly took 47 percent while his challenger, former President Carlos Mesa, took 36.5 percent.\n\nOpponents claim Bolivia\u2019s electoral authorities manipulated the vote count in favor of Morales, who will now serve his fourth term in office three years after successfully amending the country\u2019s constitution to scrap term presidential limits and allow himself to seize power indefinitely.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, the European Union said that it \u201cfully shares\u201d the view of the Organization of American States that there should be a second round.\n\n\u201cThe interim OAS (Organisation of American States) mission report has identified substantial shortcomings of the electoral process, notably the unexpected interruption of the publication of the voting results, that undermine the necessary credibility and transparency,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThe statement continued:\n\nThe European Union fully shares the OAS assessment that the Bolivian authorities should finalize the ongoing counting process and that the best option would be to hold a second round to restore trust and ensure the full respect of the democratic choice of the Bolivian people. We call on all parties to refrain from violence and from making declarations that are divisive. A constructive approach is essential for national peaceful reconciliation.\n\nIn a communique issued by Colombia\u2019s Foreign Ministry on behalf of themselves, the United States, Brazil, and Argentina, the four countries also insisted they would \u201conly recognize results that reflect the will of the Bolivian people.\u201d\n\nBolivia has been rocked by violent demonstrations taking place across the country. Many participants are warning that the country is sliding towards a socialist dictatorship similar to Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s regime in Venezuela and Cuba\u2019s longterm communist rule.\n\nA mysteriously delayed vote count in Bolivia's presidential election has sparked protests and accusations of fraud.

Yet after counting resumed, Morales suddenly gained a ten-point lead, sparking widespread suspicion about such an irregularity.\n\nPosting on Twitter on Friday, Morales appeared to show no intention of not accepting the results, having already accused opponents of instigating a U.S.-backed \u201ccoup.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not alone, we are strengthened with the truth and the struggle for the unity and dignity of our beloved Bolivia,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe people won again. We will not fall into provocation or confrontation. The democratic and peaceful struggle will carry on.\u201d\n\nNo estamos solos, estamos fortalecidos con la verdad y la lucha por la unidad y dignidad de nuestra querida Bolivia. El pueblo gan\u00f3 nuevamente. No vamos a caer en la provocaci\u00f3n ni en la confrontaci\u00f3n. La lucha democr\u00e1tica y pac\u00edfica continuar\u00e1. \u2014 Evo Morales Ayma (@evoespueblo) October 25, 2019\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Western democracies are pressuring Bolivia to agree to a second-round run-off against his opponent Carlos Mesa.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Evo-Morales-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
