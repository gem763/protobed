Beaten by Manchester United, beaten by Arsenal, they were beaten by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, knocked out of Europe at the hands of the same team that eliminated them last year. A late goal from Pauline Bremer set up a frantic final few minutes, but in the end a Steph Houghton own goal and a second from Angela Sosa was enough to take Atl\u00e9tico through, 2-1 on the night, 3-2 on aggregate, and end the City\u2019s European ambitions.\n\nSpanish club strike signposts huge attitude change by female footballers Read more\n\nFor City, twice semi-finalists, this was hard to take, and there were tears at the final whistle. \u201cThis will hurt,\u201d the manager, Nick Cushing, said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a difficult period. But we were knocked out a round earlier last year and won two trophies. We haven\u2019t lost three in a row since 2015 but we just need to make sure we keep believing and we will be fine.\u201d\n\nFor Atl\u00e9tico, it was historic. They have never been this far in the competition. Their manager, Pablo L\u00f3pez, who injured himself jumping about in the tension of the final minutes, said: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, seeing them in the dressing room singing, jumping, dancing. All I can say is thanks for having taken this historic step. I am immensely happy. It\u2019s wonderful to see how happy they are.\u201d\n\nCity had needed a goal from the start and did not get it until nearly the end, finally scoring in the 88th minute, their first goal in three matches. By then, though, Atl\u00e9tico had two and City could not add to theirs \u2013 although for a few, heart-stopping moments it seemed they might.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nEllen White was sent through on the left only for her shot to drift wide of the far post for the first chance early on and, soon after, Jill Scott\u2019s effort was blocked. But if that appeared to be a warning, urgency only arrived when the situation became critical and by then it was too late. Cushing said he felt his side had dominated, but admitted they could not create meaningful chances and lamented bad luck. \u201cIt happens in football,\u201d he said.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico, by contrast, did threaten. A lovely touch from Ludmila da Silva, flicking inside for Sosa, saw her set Toni Duggan away. Shifting the ball on to her right foot, heading horizontally into the area, Duggan was preparing to shoot when the door was closed. From a Sosa corner Ludmila\u2019s header was scrambled away for another one, from which A\u00efssatou Tounkara could not keep her attempt down.\n\nThen the goal came, five minutes before the break. Sosa found a way out of a crowd, clipping a diagonal ball to the right-hand side for Kenti Robles. She combined with Virginia Torrecilla before sending a long cross dropping behind Gemma Bonner. It seemed to be going out, but Ludmila breathed life into the move, keeping the ball from crossing the byline and sending it rebounding off Houghton and into the goal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ellen White of Manchester City is denied by the Atl\u00e9tico goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal.

City rarely convinced, although a run from deep by Lauren Hemp saw her deliver a superbly weighted pass to White only for Sari van Veenendaal to dive out and block.\n\nToni Duggan: \u2018I wanted the ground to suck me in, for the game just to end\u2019 Read more\n\nMeanwhile, Corral and Ludmilla \u2013 so direct, so fast, so hard to contain \u2013 set up Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s second. Ellie Roebuck had to save at the near post after Charlyn Corral\u2019s sprint up the left. Duggan and Sosa sent Ludmila away, only for her to be dragged down by Megan Campbell. Carmen Menayo hit wide. And then off went Corral again, streaking into the area. Roebuck saved, twice, at the near post but the ball deflected to Sosa, who scored from close range.\n\nA long looping header that could have been the first of the two goals City now needed thudded back off the bar. When they finally did score, it came from a long throw, turned in by Bremer. Atl\u00e9tico, so comfortable a few minutes before, appeared scared. Another long throw almost drew an equaliser and City\u2019s passage to the quarter-finals, but it was the Spanish side that progressed.", "description": "Manchester City went out of the Champions League after an own goal from Steph Houghton and \u00c1ngela Sosa\u2019s second-half effort proved decisive in a 2-1 win for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid", "authors": ["Sid Lowe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/477bec7f6df4136026ff7d2abe0ee3a0a4dcba9a/0_155_2768_1661/master/2768.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a2c190f59a1d5a378d509e1c3154c7e5", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
