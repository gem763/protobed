They don\u2019t seem to have made it to Swansea yet? #cadbury #orangetwirl \u2014 Robbie Meacham (@ROB_MEACH) October 4, 2019\n\nHey @CadburyUK please can you advise where in the SN15 area i can get an orange twirl?

Please keep them PERMANENTLY! They are better than Terrys Chocolate Orange.\u2019\n\n\u2018They are quite delicious. Yummers!,\u2019 tweeted someone else.\n\nPeople are so desperate to try it, some are even signing up to a waiting list at a local corner shop that is waiting on more deliveries.\n\nOrange Twirl update.
