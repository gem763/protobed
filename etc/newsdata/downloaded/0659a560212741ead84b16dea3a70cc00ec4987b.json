Because according to the law of God himself, his first commandment, idolatry is a grave sin. And not to mix them with the Christian liturgy,\u201d Cardinal M\u00fcller said.\n\n\u201cSo putting them out can be against human law, but to bring the idols into the church was a grave sin, was a crime, against the divine law. There is a deep difference,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAnd so it is worse to bring those into the church, not to take them out,\u201d he concluded.\n\n\ufeff\n\nOn Wednesday, Pope Francis told crowds gathered in Saint Peter\u2019s Square that Christianity is a big tent that welcomes everyone, including pagans, but insists that they \u201creject idolatry and all its expressions\u201d as a condition for following Christ.\n\nThe first Christians, Francis said, came to the conclusion that new Christian converts from paganism would not be obliged to follow all the prescriptions of the Mosaic law but \u201conly to reject idolatry and all its expressions.\u201d\n\nThe Synod of Bishops for the Amazon region, which has debated such topics as ecological conversion, indigenous spirituality, the ordination of married men to combat the priest shortage, and the ordination of women as deacons, began on October 6 and is scheduled to conclude this Sunday.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "The former Vatican doctrinal chief said that Amazonian \u2018idols\u2019 depicting a naked pregnant woman should never have been placed in a church.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
