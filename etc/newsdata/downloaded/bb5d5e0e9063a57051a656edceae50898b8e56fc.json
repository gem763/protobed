Instead, workers are offered 401(k)s \u2014 employer-sponsored retirement plans that allow employees to contribute a portion of their paycheck before taxes to retirement savings. These contributions are invested and, over time, grow into a nest egg you can tap when you retire.\n\nTo nudge workers, a third of employers auto-enroll their employees into a 401(k) plan, a two-fold increase from a decade ago, according to a recent analysis from Fidelity Investments.\n\nTara Valcimond, a Boston resident who works at a startup, receives advice from instructor Steven Taylor during his class, The Basics of Investing: Level I at Society of Grownups headquarters.

Younger workers should max out their annual contributions, if possible, and not doing so is the second mistake McCarty sees.\n\nFor 2019, that means you should contribute as close to the $19,000 annual limit as you can. The limits, determined by the Internal Revenue Service, typically change every year, and are usually announced in November for the upcoming tax year.\n\nThe third mistake to avoid, according to McCarty: Not taking the money your employer will contribute to your retirement.\n\nSome companies will match your annual 401(k) contributions up to a certain amount. The average employer match is 4.7%, according to Fidelity.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my clients or your viewers to be the 20% of Americans that make this big mistake,\u201d said McCarthy in a conversation with Yahoo Finance. \u201cAnd that\u2019s taking advantage of the free money your employer is giving you.\u201d\n\nDhara is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
