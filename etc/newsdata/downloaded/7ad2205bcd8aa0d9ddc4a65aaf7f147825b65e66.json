In January, Amazon Devices Senior Vice President Dave Limp told The Verge that over 100 million Alexa-installed devices have been sold so far. And it owns most of the voice assistant market, beating out the likes of Google Assistant and Cortana.\n\nStill, studies suggest that Alexa isn't the top dog when it comes to the underlying AI that helps you ask for the weather or how long your daily commute will be.\n\nLast April, market research firm Stone Temple (recently acquired by Perficient Digital) put out a study rating how smart four different voice assistants are: Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant. The company found that Google Assistant attempted to answer nearly 70 percent of the questions that it was asked and responded correctly nearly 90 percent of the time. Meanwhile, Alexa attempted a little over 50 percent of the questions and answered correctly just over 80 percent of the time.\n\nSince Alexa isn't even attempting half of the questions it was asked in the study\u2013and when it does, it gives incorrect or unwanted answers 20 percent of the time\u2014that means the technology isn't as robust as it could be.\n\nEnter Amazon's army of humans.\n\nIt's an exercise in human-computer collaboration, which is nothing new for the natural language processing space, which focuses on training computers to understand human language through machine learning algorithms.\n\nTo teach systems like Alexa, part of the process involves computer scientists feeding the platforms hoards of training data. Over time, that will teach the voice assistant patterns and allow programs like Alexa to come up with intelligent outputs. So if enough examples of questions about oranges are in the training data, there's a good chance you'll be able to ask Alexa questions about the fruit.\n\nIf Alexa struggles with a question, it means there's not enough training data on that particular subject. Per an Amazon blog post, some of those questions include:\n\n\u201cWhere was Barbara Bush buried?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho wrote the score for Lord of the Rings?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s cork made out of?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do bats go in the winter?\u201d\n\nThese queries vividly illustrate a problem that voice assistants are tangoing with today: Although machine learning capabilities are exponentially growing, artificial intelligence still has a difficult time understanding the way people speak. One turn of phrase may turn up a result for a given person, while someone else who phrases the question differently may end up disappointed.\n\n\n\nMachine learning really does improve with user feedback, so the idea isn't altogether novel\u2014it's just new in the commercial voice assistant space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStory continues", "description": "Sorry, she doesn't know that one.
