Many elderly remained in evacuation centres, unable to clean up their homes.\n\nIn Date city, not far from the site of the nuclear disaster in 2011, farmer Masao Hirayama piled damp books in the street in front of his house, adding to a mound of rubbish from the neighbourhood.\n\nHe said the water had reached about 2 metres (6.6 feet) deep in his house, when he and his son were rescued by boat and taken to an evacuation centre. His wife and grandchildren had stayed with relatives through the storm.\n\n\"I feel down,\" Hirayama, 70, said, adding that the flood had swept away all his green houses and farming equipment. \"All that is left is the land.\"\n\nHirayama said he had rebuilt his house in 1989, raising the ground level following a flood in 1986.
