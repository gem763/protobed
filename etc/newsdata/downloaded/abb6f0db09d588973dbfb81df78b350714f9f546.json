In some instances, if an interpretation of the law doesn\u2019t sit well with the public, Congress can respond by amending the law, effectively nullifying a court\u2019s decision. Or if a ruling on a constitutional question is especially egregious, a constitutional amendment, though unlikely, remains an option.\n\nBut it turns out there\u2019s a whole category of American law that is above such checks and balances. The public knows nothing about it and there\u2019s no way to challenge it in court, let alone debate it in the halls of Congress.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFor decades, the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel has flexed its interpretive power as the ultimate arbiter of what the law is for the executive branch, building a whole body of secret law that remains shielded from public view. Very little is known about these opinions\u2014which carry the force of law, resolve disputes between agencies, direct the conduct of federal officials and can even affect civil rights and liberties. In the view of one scholar, these opinions date \u201cto the beginning of the Republic\u201d and can even \u201crival the opinions of the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nThese decisions number in the thousands, and the few that become public see the light of day at the discretion of the Justice Department. But the vast majority stay secret\u2014binding executive branch officials and activities across administrations. Because almost everyone who isn\u2019t a lawyer in the office is kept in the dark about these legal conclusions, Congress and the public can\u2019t debate them or seek amendments in the event of abuses. Courts are of no help either.\n\nIndeed, without transparency to test these legal opinions in a court of law or the court of public opinion, it is often the case that the Justice Department has the final say on the actions of federal agencies and officers, and there\u2019s not much anyone can do about it. From Robert Mueller\u2019s decision to follow a 1973 Justice Department recommendation that a president can\u2019t be indicted while in office to numerous pronouncements shielding Donald Trump or officials in his administration from congressional oversight, the Office of Legal Counsel makes law that holds tremendous sway over issues of public concern.\n\nAnd yet despite the influence of the office\u2019s opinions across the executive branch and their centrality to many of Trump\u2019s controversies, all the public knows about them is the smattering of decisions that are made public from time to time. The Justice Department claims to have the last word over what gets released to the public, subject to a secretive \u201cpublication review committee\u201d that calls the shots.\n\nAccording to one former Justice Department official, in 1991, when Attorney General William Barr first led the Justice Department, the government only published 13 opinions out of an estimated 625 that the Office of Legal Counsel gave to other agencies\u2014a paltry 2 percent that leaves Americans with little understanding of the law that guided the United States\u2019 government at the time.\n\nIn 2016, Congress amended the Freedom of Information Act to place a 25-year cap on documents previously shielded by what the Justice Department calls \u201cdeliberative process privilege\u201d\u2014which the government has cited in the past to keep Office of Legal Counsel\u2019s precedent-setting legal opinions secret. By law, then, that type of privilege should no longer cover such decisions older than 25 years\u2014though some or portions of them may still be kept from disclosure if, for example, they contain classified information. And neither should the department be allowed to claim attorney-client privilege over these opinions, which aren\u2019t legal advice but controlling decisions of law.\n\n\n\nWith this understanding of the law and with an eye toward greater transparency, a group of scholars last week filed a lawsuit in federal court arguing that Office of Legal Counsel memoranda that are at least 25 years old should be disclosed to the public under the Freedom of Information Act. Among the plaintiffs are historians of presidential power, the civil rights movement, the laws of war, government surveillance and immigration\u2014all areas where the government\u2019s enormous discretion to enforce the law has been guided by legal judgments that our citizenry would be well served to understand and reckon with, even today. The Justice Department didn\u2019t comply with an earlier administrative request for these opinions.\n\nUnderstanding past overreach could help us better understand today\u2019s. Barr, then and now, is the kind of attorney general whose expansive views of executive power deserve legal scrutiny\u2014and the public is entitled to know to what extent the Office of Legal Counsel abetted or disregarded his maximalist impulses. More than 25 years ago, he was behind some of the Justice Department\u2019s darkest hours: From a lawless surveillance program he approved that long predated the National Security Agency\u2019s post-9/11 excesses to his role in recommending pardons for officials implicated in the Iran-Contra affair, the American people deserve to know how much secret law he helped create for the presidents he\u2019s served\u2014and how much of it may still be good law for the rest of the executive branch today. For all we know, some of these decisions may have been overruled by later administrations, presidents or attorneys general; the enduring secrecy of these opinions makes it difficult to tell.\n\nRight now, we see these opinions\u2019 weight and opacity playing out. In December, the Trump administration is expected to resume executing federal prisoners on death row, ending a longstanding, de facto moratorium on the federal death penalty. Barr\u2019s decision to reinstate the practice didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum, but was preceded by the advice of the Office of Legal Counsel, which in May concluded in a 26-page memorandum that the Food and Drug Administration lacks the authority to regulate \u201cdrugs\u201d and \u201cdevices\u201d used in capital punishment.\n\nThat conclusion was squarely at odds with the agency\u2019s prior disapproval of pentobarbital, the drug Barr now wants to use in the upcoming executions. Whatever regulatory roadblocks existed before have been removed. The Office of Legal Counsel has now declared what the law is\u2014at least as far as the executive branch and the FDA are concerned. Unless a court steps in, these executions will move forward with Barr\u2019s new lethal cocktail of choice.\n\nThe Office of Legal Counsel\u2019s historical memoranda may not all concern issues of life and death, but they should concern all of us\u2014and the Justice Department would be acting in the national interest if it disclosed them as the law requires.", "description": "The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel has built a whole body of secret law that remains shielded from public view.", "authors": ["Michael Kruse", "Cristian Farias"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/29/15/941b5265488b8b358ca1b92923cf/190506-bill-barr-gty-773.jpg"}
