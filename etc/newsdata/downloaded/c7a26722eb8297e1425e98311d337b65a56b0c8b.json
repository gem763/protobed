Oli Scarff/Getty Images\n\nProrogation is the formal name given to the period of time between the suspension of one parliamentary session and another.\n\nBritish governments usually arrange for a new parliamentary session every year or so.\n\nAccording to convention, this happens when the Privy Council (a body of senior politicians who act as the Queen's official advisers on the exercise of her limited executive powers) request that she \"prorogue\" (or suspend) parliament.\n\nThe new session will begin with the State Opening of Parliament and all of its associated pageantry (carriage processions, trumpets and the like). The Queen's Speech is at the center of this; the monarch reads a text that lays out her government's legislative priorities for the upcoming session.\n\nIn reality, the speech is written by Downing Street, and on October 14 the monarch will simply be a mouthpiece for Prime Minister Boris Johnson.", "description": "Boris Johnson will try to convince UK lawmakers to grant him a snap general election for the second time on Monday, before suspending parliament in the run-up to Brexit.", "authors": ["Cnn'S Matt Wells", "Cnn'S Luke Mcgee"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190906170200-boris-johnson-scotland-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
