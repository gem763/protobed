Pompeo, CIA Director Gina Haspel, National Security Adviser John Bolton, and the secretary of defense tried to meet with Trump to urge him to release the assistance. \u201c[S]uch a meeting was hard to schedule, and the hold lasted well into September,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nNSC officials later told him that acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney directed that the aid be withheld, and that he \u201cmaintained a skeptical view of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nTaylor also described a dramatic July 10 White House meeting between Ukrainian officials, Bolton, and Sondland. NSC officials described the meeting to Taylor, who was not present for it. According to Taylor, Sondland told Ukrainians that \u201cinvestigations\u201d were connected to their quest for an Oval Office meeting between Trump and Zelensky. The comment \u201cso irritated Ambassador Bolton that he abruptly ended the meeting,\u201d told the officials to stay away from domestic politics, and directed one of the officials to \u201cbrief the lawyers.\u201d\n\nIn addition, \u201cAmbassador Sondland said that he had talked to President Zelenskyy and Mr. Yermak and told them that, although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not 'clear things up' in public, we would be at a \u2018stalemate.\u2019 I understood a \u2018stalemate\u2019 to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military assistance,\u201d Taylor told Congress.\n\nSondland told Zelensky that when he discussed investigating Hunter Biden\u2019s company and 2016 election meddling with Trump, he should promise to \u201cleave no stone unturned.\u201d\n\nThe attempt to pressure the Ukrainian president into a public declaration of an investigation into Biden is one of many revelations in Taylor\u2019s testimony on Tuesday. That testimony is currently underway.\n\nTaylor also cast doubt on President Trump\u2019s repeated descriptions of his July 25 call with President Zelensky as \u201cperfect,\u201d an opinion some of his aides did not share. Taylor said that Morrison, the National Security Council staffer, told him the call in which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, \u201ccould have been better.\u201d\n\nBolton opposed the idea of a Trump/Zelensky call and, per Taylor, thought it \u201cwould be a disaster.\u201d\n\nTaylor also cast doubt on President Trump\u2019s repeated descriptions of his July 25 call with President Zelensky as \u201cperfect,\u201d an opinion some of his aides did not share. Taylor had not been listening in on the call and did not receive a readout but he said that Tim Morrison, the top Eurasia staffer on the National Security Council, told him the call in which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, \u201ccould have been better.\u201d\n\nZelensky told both Taylor and Volker afterwards that he was \u201chappy with the call but did not elaborate.\"\n\nWhen the White House finally released a rough transcript of the call, however, Taylor said Ukrainian officials were \u201clivid\u201d and had been given \u201cvirtually no notice\u201d that it would be published.\n\nTaylor described two different\u2013\u2013and conflicting\u2013\u2013channels of diplomacy between the U.S. and Ukraine: the official channel and an unofficial channel, which included Volker, Sondland, and Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. Some members of the unofficial channel tried to push the Ukrainians to investigate the company where Hunter Biden was a board member.\n\nTaylor took over as charg\u00e9 d'affaires to Ukraine in May after a whisper campaign lead by Rudy Giuliani prompted Trump to recall Amb. Marie Yovanovitch. A career diplomat, Taylor wasn\u2019t among the \u201cthree amigos\u201d\u2014Energy Sec. Rick Perry, Special Representative Kurt Volker, and Sondland\u2014deputized by Trump to take the lead on the U.S.-Ukraine relationship. He told Congress he was concerned about the direction of Ukraine policy before taking the job.\n\nTaylor said he accepted the job of chief diplomat with hesitation, as he was \u201cworried\u201d about rumors of Giuliani\u2019s backchannel diplomacy with Ukrainian officials and felt Yovanovitch had been \"treated poorly and \"caught in a web of political machinations both in Kyiv and in Washington.\"\n\nAs Sondland and Volker kept pressing Zelensky over the summer, Taylor appeared to be a voice of caution, if not open hostility, towards the effort to squeeze Ukrainian officials into a politically tinged corruption investigation. In July, he told the two that \"Zelensky is sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics,\u201d according to text messages released the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nTaylor said that the weight of the Trump administration\u2019s decision to halt military aid to Ukraine as part of the apparent pressure campaign weighed on him during a visit to the frontlines of Ukraine\u2019s war with Russian-backed rebels. \u201cMore Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without the U.S. assistance,\u201d Taylor recalled in his testimony.\n\nAs the Trump administration put the breaks on military aid designed to hold off Russia\u2019s occupation of Eastern Ukraine, Taylor grew more resistant to the pressure campaign. In a September text message to Sondland, he called it \u201ccrazy\u201d to withhold aid in exchange for domestic political favors.\n\nIn his statement on Tuesday, Taylor stood by that characterization. \u201cI believed that then, and I still believe that.\u201d", "description": "A private pledge to investigate a political rival\u2019s clan wasn\u2019t enough.
