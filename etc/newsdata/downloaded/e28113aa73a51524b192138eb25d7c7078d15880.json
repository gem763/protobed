These include the Bristol Channel, parts of Devon and Cornwall as well as the Dutch and German North Sea coasts.\n\nThe west Norwegian coast near Bergen will see a fivefold increase in potential compound flood frequency.\n\nWhile the well documented threat from rising seas driven by climate change will increase flood risk in many parts, the researchers involved with this study are at pains to point out that the compound flood threat is an additional threat.\n\n\"It is not only changing because of sea level rise, but also because there will be changes in the storminess with higher precipitation intensities which will lead to higher compound flooding in northern Europe,\" said Dr Bevacqua.\n\nOther researchers in the field say the question of compound events have been ignored for a long time, mainly because of limitations in statistical tools and computational resources.\n\n\"The results are relevant as they point to hotspots where compound flooding may already pose a risk and where it may increase in the future, requiring attention by decision-makers when planning adequate adaptation strategies,\" said Prof Thomas Wahl from the University of Central Florida in Orlando, who was not involved in this new study.\n\n\"The modelling framework that was used in the study furthermore allows us to disentangle the role of the different compound flood drivers in modulating the future compound flood risk, whether it's changes in the sea level component, or precipitation, or both.\"\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter.", "description": "A new study shows that there's a higher probability for extreme flooding on UK coasts as global temperatures rise.", "authors": ["Matt Mcgrath", "Environment Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/034C/production/_108844800_gettyimages-472156399.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
