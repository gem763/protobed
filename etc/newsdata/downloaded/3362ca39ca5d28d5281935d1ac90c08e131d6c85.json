He allowed us to get all three points.\n\n\"There is always a lot of criticism when we lose and today we won, we played with personality and the players have deserved the victory.\"", "description": "A goal from German midfielder Toni Kroos gave Real Madrid their first win of this season's Champions League", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20703582.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Champions-League-Group-A-Galatasaray-v-Real-Madrid.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
