A 42-year-old post office employee confessed to the crime and faces charges of murder, rape and defeating the ends of justice, News24 reported. The man in question reportedly has a previous criminal record.\n\nThe union, in a statement on Thursday, described the crime as \"disgusting\" and \"senseless\".\n\nCall for Post Office crackdown\n\n\"We, as the majority trade union of communication workers, condemn this disgusting act ... We note that judiciary processes are underway and respect our justice system; however, we call for a harsher sentence that will set an example.\"\n\nIt also called for the Post Office to crack down on harassment and sexual abuse of women, saying a failure to do this could \"indirectly tacitly encourag[e] many criminals instead of [letting them face] their due justice\".\n\n\"We express our heartfelt condolences to the Mrwetyana family, the community of UCT and 'Nene\u2019s' friends for the loss of their loved one. We are saying, on behalf of South African Post Office workers that, 'Not in Our Name!' \u2026 We will continue to hold accountable the workers [and management] alongside us,\" the union said.", "description": "The Communication Workers' Union has called for a \"harsher sentence\" for the man accused of killing UCT student Uyinene Mrwetyana, that will \"set an example\".", "authors": ["Marelise Van Der Merwe"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9307/9f5e8a048f084b708ddd81a84f7d7bb1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
