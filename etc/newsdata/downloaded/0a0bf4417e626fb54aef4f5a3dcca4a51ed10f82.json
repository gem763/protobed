The venue was not responsible for the decision.\n\n\u2018However, we were very sorry for any inconvenience it caused our audience and we thanks them for their understanding.\u2019\n\nReacting to the last-minute cancellation, punters took to social media to sound off on the controversy.\n\nThe people fight back, indeed.\n\nOne claimed on Twitter: \u2018Went to see Jim Davidson last night but because they put him in a smaller room he decided to walk away and left all the people who bought tickets to see his show very angry as some came from far away and booked hotel it just not fair.\u2019\n\nAnother called the comedian a \u2018disgrace\u2019 as they wrote: \u2018Jim Davidson cancelled his show tonight in Southport. Arrived at the venue kicked off at staff swearing and shouting refused to perform, 500 people with no show to watch, travel and hotel costs which are not refundable bloke is a disgrace!\u2019\n\nJim has threatened to not turn up to shows before (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nOne angry fan replied to the theatre on Facebook: \u2018Disgrace, from what we got told it\u2019s not an illness or accident which would be forgiven.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Exact words from the lady at floral hall \u201cOur staff will not allow him back in here\u201d, what does that say!!\n\n\u2018Day off work booked, hotel booked, meal booked, car parking booked. For an event to be cancelled 20 mins before he\u2019s due on. Absolute disgrace. Jim Davidson explain yourself????\u2019\n\nEarlier this year the comedian threatened to skip out of a gig in Dundee, after he turned up to the theatre and didn\u2019t see any advertising for his show.\n\n\u2018Just arrived at the whitehall theatre in Dundee. Not a poster in sight no fliers and a A frame outside adverising another show. Of 45 gigs sold out this one of the 3 that didn\u2019t. I am back at the hotel. Why should I bother.? No wonder it went skint a few years back, [sic]\u2019 he wrote in May.\n\nIn 2017 the comedian cancelled a gig in Exeter 30 minutes before he was due on stage, with the comedian slamming management.\n\n\u2018Deep apologies to the poor people who were expecting to see me at the corn exchange tonight [\u2026] We were contracted to get in and sound check at 5. They let us in at 6 30. We could have fixed the sound system perhaps. But not at 6 30. And to be told \u201cyou are welcome to come back when its fixed\u201d the lad doing the sound said \u201cour propper speakers have blown up\u201d, [sic]\u2019 he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Worse thing? The attitude of the two persons running the place and the bulls**t that they come out with when they clearly know it is their fault. They will now be planning ways to blame me.\n\n\u2018I did nt argue with them as i could be accused of saying anything!!! These women plainly showed they did not want me there. I don\u2019t know what else to say except sorry and shame on them. [sic].\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk has made numerous attempts to contact Jim\u2019s reps for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
