Chinese state television has refused to air NBA games, and a slew of Chinese businesses have blacklisted or cut ties with the league.\n\nThe NBA also took heat from U.S. politicians after issuing a statement expressing regrets to any offended Chinese fans, and another statement in Mandarin condemning Morey. The backlash was bipartisan as lawmakers accused the NBA of pushing profits over principles and yielding to Chinese censorship.\n\nSilver later strengthened his response to China, insisting the NBA would always promote and stand for free expression. The commissioner said Thursday that he found criticism of his actions \u201cconfusing,\u201d adding that he \u201cthought we\u2019d taken a principled position.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I was trying too hard to be a diplomat,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it as my role as the commissioner of the NBA to weigh in on the substance of the protest, but to say here\u2019s this platform.\u201d\n\nWhile the NBA bore the brunt of Washington, D.C.\u2019s anger, the White House and Congress have ramped up their warnings over a feared Chinese crackdown on Hong Kong demonstrators.\n\nThe Chinese government threatened to respond with \u201cstrong countermeasures\u201d if the Senate approves House-passed legislation to condemn Beijing\u2019s treatment of Hong Kong.", "description": "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Thursday that the league has suffered \u201csubstantial\u201d financial losses in the wake of its China controversy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/chinanba2_100919getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
