Henry McMaster said at a news conference Wednesday. Even if the hurricane doesn\u2019t end up hitting the state directly, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s still going to be wind and water and if you\u2019re in the coastal area, that water can be treacherous.\u201d\n\nDorian appeared likely to get dangerously near Charleston, which is particularly vulnerable since it is located on a peninsula. A flood chart posted by the National Weather Service projected a combined high tide and storm surge around Charleston Harbor of 10.3 feet; the record, 12.5 feet, was set by Hugo in 1989.\n\nTropical storm watches from #Dorian have extended north into Maryland as hurricane warnings remain in effect for the entire Carolina coastline.

More than 400 people were in state-operated shelters statewide, and more were expected.\n\nMark Russell, a homeless U.S. Army veteran, said he had been in a shelter since Monday awaiting slow-moving Dorian.\n\n\u201cOnce the rain comes and the wind hits, it\u2019s going to blow left, right, in and out, and there\u2019s not really a place that you can find\u201d to avoid it, said Russell, 63.\n\nIn North Carolina, where authorities said an 85-year-old man died after falling from a ladder while getting ready for the storm, Gov. Roy Cooper warned about the threat of storm surge and flash flooding from heavy rains. The Outer Banks were particularly vulnerable.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s coastal islands were also at risk, Gov. Brian Kemp said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe are very worried, especially about the barrier islands getting cut off if we have these storm surges at the same time as ... the high tides,\u201d Kemp said.\n\nDuke Energy said Dorian could cause more than 700,000 power outages in eastern regions of North Carolina and South Carolina, and Georgia Power said about 2,800 homes and businesses were already without electricity.\n\nThe Navy ordered ships at its huge base in Norfolk, Virginia, to head out to sea for safety, and warplanes at Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Virginia, were being moved inland to Ohio.\n\nWeaker but bigger since it slammed the Bahamas with 185 mph winds earlier this week, Dorian was moving along Florida\u2019s northeastern coast at 8 mph late Wednesday afternoon. Forecasters said it had maximum sustained winds of 110 mph and was centered about 150 miles south of Charleston.\n\nA hurricane warning covered about 500 miles of coastline, and authorities warned about 3 million residents to get away before the water and wind rose with Dorian\u2019s approach.\n\nThe acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Peter Gaynor, said 4,000 federal responders; 6,000 National Guard members; and 40,000 utility workers were on standby for the hurricane.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to go,\u201d Gaynor said. \u201cWe\u2019ll follow Dorian up the coast until it is not a threat to the U.S.\u201d\n\nIn Florida, initially projected to take a direct hit from Dorian, there was widespread relief and gratitude on Wednesday after the storm passed the state from a relatively safe distance offshore.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky today,\u201d said Ryan Haggett, kitchen manager at the Oceanside Beach Bar and Grill, at Flagler Beach on the state\u2019s central coast. Haggett and others were removing storm shutters they had placed over the restaurant\u2019s windows and planned to serve dinner Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cThis storm was much less than what happened two years ago, three years ago with Irma and Matthew,\u201d Haggett said, referring to the deadly storms that hit in 2017 and 2016. \u201cThey were the worst.\u201d\n\nWith the threat to Florida easing and the danger shifting northward, Orlando, Florida\u2019s international airport reopened, as did Walt Disney World and Universal. Dorian forced Disney Cruise Line to cancel one trip and delay the return of another ship to Port Canaveral, Florida.\n\nOne resident in the state died while preparing for the storm Monday evening, when Dorian\u2019s path was still projected to include central Florida. Joseph Walden, 56, was sitting on a tree limb and using a chainsaw to trim other limbs in the Orlando suburb of Ocoee when one of the cut limbs broke free and struck him, pushing him to the ground, Ocoee police said in a news release. He was pronounced dead at a hospital.", "description": "Weakened but still deadly, Hurricane Dorian crept up the Southeastern coast of the United States on Wednesday and millions were ordered to evacuate as...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ716_dorian_ZG_20190904194258.jpg"}
