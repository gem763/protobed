REUTERS/Tony Gentile\n\nEconomic growth is seen around 0.6% next year, and rising to 1.0% in each of the following two years, according to a draft of the targets seen by the source.\n\nThe Cabinet is due to sign off on the new targets contained in the Treasury\u2019s Economic and Financial Document (DEF) at a meeting on Monday.\n\nThe targets are still subject to possible marginal revisions ahead of Monday\u2019s meeting, the source said. In particular the 2020 deficit goal could be lowered to 2.1% depending on ongoing negotiations with the European Commission.\n\nThis year\u2019s deficit is seen at around 2.0% of GDP, Deputy Economy Minister Antonio Misiani said this week.\n\nThe new government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party intends to avoid an increase in sales tax worth some 23 billion euros ($25 billion)scheduled for January, which was promised to the European Union as a backstop to ensure Rome respected the bloc\u2019s fiscal rules.\n\nHowever Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, in comments on Friday, did not rule out possible adjustments to value added tax (VAT) rates.\n\nUnder an unchanged policy scenario, which includes the full VAT tax hike, next year\u2019s deficit would fall to around 1.5% of GDP, two sources told Reuters earlier this week.\n\nItaly has proportionally the second highest public debt in the EU after that of bailed-out Greece, and has made little progress in reducing its deficit toward a balanced budget in recent years as EU rules prescribe.\n\nThe debt is forecast to rise this year from last year\u2019s 134.8% of GDP, the political source said, before declining in 2020, 2021 and 2022.\n\nItaly has urged the EU to ease what it calls the \u201cexcessive rigidity\u201d of EU fiscal rules to head off the risk of recession in the 19-nation euro currency bloc.", "description": "Italy will target its budget deficit at around 2.2% of gross domestic product next year, falling to 1.8% in 2021 and 1.4% in 2022, a political source said on Saturday.", "authors": ["Gavin Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434863134&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R0BO", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
