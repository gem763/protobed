It is like a bank account, where you receive, store, and send money. The wallet safeguards the secret code (private key) you need to use your bitcoins and helps manage transactions. Just like your credit card numbers, you need to keep it as secure as possible. Otherwise, someone might access your funds.\n\nHow to set up a Bitcoin wallet?\n\nThere are many Bitcoin wallets out there, and all of them differ in their characteristics. Mobile software wallets are great for day-to-day use, while desktop software wallets bring about a great balance between convenience and security. Lightweight web wallets are the best choice for quick online transactions. Cold encrypted hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor are the best for long-term storage of bitcoin. However, unlike other options, hardware wallets aren\u2019t free and cost $50 or more.\n\nLet us look closer at these three ways to set up a Bitcoin wallet.\n\nHow to set up a Bitcoin wallet on your mobile phone?

A software wallet is a program that stores private and public keys and interacts with blockchain to enable users to send and receive digital currency and monitor their balance. There are two types of software wallets - mobile and desktop.\n\nMobile software wallets are lightweight Bitcoin clients that enable you to carry your bitcoins everywhere. It can be extremely convenient at times. To set it up, you have to download a Bitcoin wallet of choice. There are many of those in the app store, but here are a few you can trust:\n\nMycellium\n\nBread (BRD) wallet\n\nBitcoin wallet\n\nElectrum\n\nSamourai\n\nMobile bitcoin wallet.

Web-based wallets store your private keys online on a server controlled by an admin group. Some bitcoin web wallets, like Coinbase, conveniently link between your mobile and software wallets. You can access this wallet anywhere where you have an internet connection, which makes it a popular and convenient choice.\n\nHowever, be aware the website is in charge of your private keys and can take your bitcoin out of your control at any time, which is why web wallets are good for storing only limited amounts of bitcoin. While there are only a few instances where web-wallet service providers had malicious intentions, web wallet service providers are honeypots for hackers, which significantly increases the risk of them being hacked.\n\nPopular Bitcoin web wallets include:\n\nCoinbase\n\nBlockchain.info\n\nBTC.com\n\nRahakott\n\nBitGo\n\n3. Set up a Bitcoin hardware wallet\n\nLast but not least, we have bitcoin hardware wallets, which are considered the most secure way to store your bitcoins long-term.\n\nBitcoin hardware wallet Nano Ledger S.

These wallets can be carried with you and don\u2019t rely on keeping funds in a third party's hands. However, these you need to buy.
