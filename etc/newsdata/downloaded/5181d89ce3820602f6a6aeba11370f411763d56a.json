The U.S. economy is still creating lots of new jobs more than a decade after the last recession.\n\nThe U.S. is not creating new jobs as fast as it was last year, but it\u2019s still putting enough new hires to work to keep growth afloat even as the economy enters choppier waters.\n\nHere\u2019s what to watch in the August employment report due Friday morning.\n\nSteady hiring ...\n\nEconomists polled by MarketWatch predict the U.S. added 173,000 jobs last month, marking a slight increase from July.\n\nSo far this year the U.S. has produced an average of 165,000 new jobs a month, down from a 223,000 pace in 2018. A slowing economy hurt by the trade war with China is part of the reason, but hiring was bound to slow after the creation of nearly 22 million jobs since 2010.\n\nThe good news? The U.S. only has to create about 100,000 new jobs a month \u2014 or even less \u2014 to soak up all the new people entering the labor force and keep the unemployment rate near a 50-year low.\n\nRead: ADP says 195,000 private-sector jobs added in August\n\n... with one big caveat\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if job gains are disappointing, however. Economists at NatWest Markets point out that the government\u2019s initial estimate of new jobs created in August has fallen well short of Wall Street\u2019s forecast in seven of the past 10 years.\n\nThe average gap: 43,000.\n\nWith so many people on vacation in August, the number of respondents to the government\u2019s monthly questionnaire is often the lowest of the year. As more responses are returned, the government usually ends up revising job growth higher. That\u2019s happened in eight of the past 10 years.\n\nRead: Service-oriented firms grow faster in August, cushion economy from China trade war\n\n\n\nWhere the jobs are\n\nManufacturers have sharply cut back on hiring. Energy companies, too. The retail industry, meanwhile, continues to shed jobs amid an onslaught by online competitors.\n\nMost of the new jobs being created are in hotels, restaurants, hospitals and white-collar fields such as tech. Employment in construction also appears to be on the rebound as falling mortgage rates draw in more prospective home buyers.\n\nUltra-low unemployment\n\nThe jobless rate has hovered between 3.6% and 3.8% in the past six months and that\u2019s unlikely to change. Economists predict unemployment will stick to 3.7%.\n\nA broader measure of unemployment known as U6 \u2014 often referred to as the real unemployment rate \u2014 fell to 7.1% in July to mark the lowest level since 2001.\n\n\n\nRising wages\n\nJust a year ago the Federal Reserve started to worry about rising wages as it moved to lift U.S. interest rates. And now? The central bank seems to have no worries at all even though wage growth remains fairly strong. The Fed is expected to cut rates again later this month.\n\nAverage hourly earnings are expected to increase 0.3% in August, leaving the increase over the past year at 3.2%. Wages typically rise 3% to 4% a year when the economy is peaking.\n\nKeep an eye on the average number of hours employees work each week. It fell to a nearly two-year low of 34.3 hours in July. If it falls again it would surely raise alarms.", "description": "The U.S. is not creating new jobs as fast as it was last year, but it\u2019s still putting enough new hires to work to keep growth afloat even as the economy...", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
