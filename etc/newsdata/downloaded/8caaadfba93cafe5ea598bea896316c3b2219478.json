Susan Davis said she was stepping down out of a \u201ca desire to live and work \u2018at home\u2019 in San Diego.\u201d | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo California Democrat Susan Davis won't seek another term\n\nCalifornia Rep. Susan Davis has opted against another term after nearly two decades in the House, a move that should set off a scramble among Democrats but is unlikely to affect the House majority.\n\nIn an email to her constituents, the San Diego Democrat said she was stepping down out of a \u201ca desire to live and work \u2018at home\u2019 in San Diego.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI do not know what I will do next but I know there are many ways to serve our community,\u201d Davis, 75, wrote before suggesting that she plans to endorse a successor: \u201cI know you will pick your next representative wisely. That person will also represent me, so I will look to those who put this noble pursuit of public interest above self-interest.\u201d\n\nDemocrats wield a 20-point registration advantage in California\u2019s 53rd House district, making it unlikely that the seat Davis is forfeiting will flip in 2020. The more consequential outcome will likely be a number of San Diego-area Democrats vying for a rare open spot in Congress.\n\nMembers of California\u2019s state Legislature operate under term limits, unlike lawmakers in Congress, which often translates into a surplus of current and former elected officials searching for another office.\n\nDavis\u2019 exit adds another variable to an already-dynamic electoral map in California, where seven first-term Democrats are looking to defend formerly Republican seats.\n\nNear the seat Davis currently occupies, multiple Republicans are seeking the CA-50th post still held by GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter, who is battling federal charges of campaign finance violations.", "description": "The San Diego Democrat said she was stepping down out of a \u201ca desire to live and work \u2018at home\u2019 in San Diego.\u201d", "authors": ["Jeremy B.
