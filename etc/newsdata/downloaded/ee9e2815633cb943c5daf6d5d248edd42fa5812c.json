Just a reminder that Menstruation does not equal Female. Maybe rethink this new look. pic.twitter.com/1Fp8bdB6qY \u2014 idiot \ud83c\udf83 (@Sara_Kelhi) March 31, 2019\n\ntw// periods\n\n\n\nhi @Always i understand that you guys love girl positivity but please understand that there are trans men that get periods, and if you could please do something about the \u2640\ufe0fsymbol on your pad packaging, i\u2019d be happy. i\u2019d hate to have any trans males feel dysphoric. \u2014 jocelyn \u2730 (@phiddies) October 13, 2019\n\nA P&G spokesperson told CBS News this week that it had taken customer feedback into account in its decision to alter its packaging.\n\n\u201cWe routinely assess our products, packaging, and designs,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe take into account a broad array of factors, including feedback from consumers, to ensure we are meeting the needs of everyone who uses our products. The change to our pad wrapper design is consistent with that practice.\u201d\n\nSaunders said in a recent tweet that P&G had sent him an email sharing news of the packaging redesign.\n\n\u201cWe listened to you and our marketing team worked [up] a solution!\u201d read the email, which P&G confirmed to Snopes.com was authentic. \u201cWe are absolutely grateful for having people like you voicing their opinions.\u201d\n\nThe company said the new wrapper design would be rolled out starting in December, but would be \u201cadapted by multiple markets at various dates.\u201d\n\nNot all heroes wear capes...\n\n\n\n...Ben wears @Always. pic.twitter.com/XzE1hJ4ofb \u2014 \ud835\udd6f\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd89\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd9e \ud835\udd77\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd8a \ud835\udd78\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd94 (@tiz_i_) October 18, 2019\n\nIn the wake of P&G\u2019s announcement, some critics on social media have blasted the company for caving into the demands of \u201ccrazy liberals\u201d and for attempting to \u201celiminate\u201d and \u201cerase women.\u201d Some have even called for a boycott of the Always brand.\n\nOthers, however, have lauded the company for embracing diversity.\n\nJack Turban, a resident physician in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, told NBC News that P&G\u2019s decision to remove the \u201cunnecessary\u201d symbol sends a message to transgender and non-binary people that the company \u201caccepts, respects, and cares about this population, which is a powerful statement for a community that is so often marginalized and rejected.\u201d\n\nSteph deNormand, manager of Fenway Health\u2019s trans health program, agreed.\n\n\u201cFor folks using these products on a nearly monthly basis, it can be harmful and distressing to see binary/gendered images, coding, language and symbols. So, using less coded products can make a huge difference,\u201d deNormand told NBC. \u201cTrans and nonbinary folks are constantly misgendered, and a gesture like this can broaden out the experiences and open up spaces for those who need the products.\u201d", "description": "The brand had been urged to ditch the Venus symbol so as to not alienate transgender and gender-nonconforming customers who menstruate.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db013ec210000ba1e34aca4.jpeg?cache=xgq8vpgjmj&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
