If you've got a Tommee Tippee perfect prep machine or know of someone who has.\n\n'For the past month Harry and Jacob have been projectile vomiting everyday.

Please please don't use these.'\n\nBianca Ready added: 'Omg I've heard of people saying about them before. I'm glad you've mentioned it as I was going to get one for the new baby. Hope the boys are ok. You would think it be just the filter that needed changing... I'm so shocked. Thank you.'\n\nKersha May Davies said: 'It made mine so unwell, doing it as our parents did is so much safer. As they say if it's not broken don't try to fix it.'\n\nIt's not the first time there has been concerns over the Tommee Tippee Perfect Prep Machine.\n\nTwo years ago, Tommee Tippee investigated claims the product was producing black mould in the pipes and failing to clean the machine and asked for parents to come forward to help them understand the issue.\n\nSome social media users said they would have reservations about using the bottle making machine\n\nDaniella McNeill from Glenrothes, Fife, came forward two years ago saying she followed the company's procedures and rules to the letter and the product still formed mould.\n\nMs McNeill claims the hidden residue in the product was the reason behind why her daughter was frequently ill.\n\nTommee Tippee said at the time: 'We were very concerned by these findings and started an immediate investigation. Until they've been examined, it's impossible to determine the exact cause.'\n\nMailOnline has contacted Tommee Tippee for comment regarding the latest claims.", "description": "Bethany Phillips from South Wales claims the Tommee Tippee Perfect Prep machine has caused her boys to vomit because 'mould' has built up in the pipes despite her cleaning it.", "authors": ["Chantalle Edmunds For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/14/19395502-0-image-a-14_1570454629435.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
