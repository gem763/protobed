(Loic Venance/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA few years ago, Geena Davis helped invent a technological tool that had the potential, in her words, to \u201cchange everything.\u201d\n\nSince launching the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media at Mount Saint Mary\u2019s University in 2004, the Academy Award\u2013winning actor and advocate had been commissioning research on the representation of women and girls on screen \u2014 especially in children\u2019s media \u2014 and sharing the results with decision-makers and content creators in the entertainment industry.\n\nHer assumption was that, once her colleagues saw the statistics, change would surely follow. But gathering the data was slow and cumbersome, and the results didn\u2019t reflect such fine-grained subtleties as how much time women spent actually speaking and appearing on screen.\n\nIn 2012, after receiving a $1.2 million grant from Google and working with computer engineers and social scientists, Davis launched the Geena Davis Inclusion Quotient, or GD-IQ, a method of using facial and voice recognition technology to analyze movies, TV shows and ads. The software, designed by University of Southern California professor Shrikanth Narayanan and a team of engineers at USC\u2019s Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory, along with Geena Davis Institute senior research adviser Caroline Heldman, is able to ascertain the number of women relative to men, as well as the amount of screen and speaking time they\u2019re afforded. (The GD-IQ tool can also recognize race; gender-nonconforming characters, as well as those with intellectual and physical differences, are coded manually.)\n\nThis June, Davis received results that made her do \u201chandsprings.\u201d GD-IQ analysis of leading characters in the 50 most popular children\u2019s television programs in 2018 showed that on-screen gender parity had been achieved, with women accounting for 52 percent of lead or co-lead roles in those shows. Screen time and speaking time had also reached or exceeded equality \u2014 55.3 percent and 50.3 percent, respectively.\n\nJust to make sure, Davis asked institute researchers to conduct research going back 10 years and found that, having reached a 50-50 balance in 2011, the ratio of women to men on screen hadn\u2019t just sustained \u2014 it had increased by 10 percent since 2008.\n\n\u201cI was ecstatic,\u201d Davis recalls. \u201cThe goal from the very beginning was gender balance in what kids see on screen. To achieve parity for leads in television, in this amount of time, is just . . . I was going say beyond what I would hope for, but it\u2019s exactly what I hoped for.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, at an event at Google\u2019s New York offices, the Geena Davis Institute will release its official report on those findings, as well as more granular information. For example, male and female characters in children\u2019s shows are shown pursuing interests in science, technology, engineering and math at exactly the same rate (albeit in small actual numbers, with only 3.5 percent of kids\u2019 TV characters engaging in STEM activities overall). What\u2019s more, female characters are more likely to be depicted as leaders than male characters (45.5 percent compared to 41.4 percent), and they\u2019re generally portrayed as smarter than their male counterparts.\n\nThe STEM statistics are particularly gratifying for Madeline Di Nonno, the chief executive of the Geena Davis Institute, who notes that the organization has been \u201ccontinuously doing STEM studies\u201d since Barack Obama made it a top priority during his administration.\n\nDi Nonno recalls being commissioned by 21st Century Fox in 2017 to validate the \u201cScully effect,\u201d wherein Gillian Anderson\u2019s character in \u201cThe X-Files\u201d inspired girls and young women to go into scientific fields. \u201cWe found that 63 percent of the women who are working in STEM today attribute it to that character,\u201d Di Nonno says.\n\nDavis says her interest in gender and children\u2019s programming was sparked when she began watching preschool shows with her then-2-year-old daughter. \u201cI was absolutely stunned,\u201d she recalls of realizing how lopsided the shows were. There were a few exceptions. \u201cThe Teletubbies are actually gender-balanced,\u201d she notes wryly, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know if you can tell.\u201d\n\n\n\nDisney Junior\u2019s \u201cDoc McStuffins\u201d was commended by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media for having a positive impact on young children, particularly girls, in pursuing a STEM career. Davis also voiced a guest role in the series. (Disney Junior)\n\nRight out of the gate in 2004, Davis\u2019s institute commissioned a study of children\u2019s TV shows and movies extending back to 1990. Since then, Davis has met with thousands of network and studio leaders, department heads, directors, writers, showrunners, advertising executives and guild officials, sharing the data she has amassed in the belief that numbers \u2014 not shaming or blaming \u2014 move the needle.\n\nBrown Johnson, executive vice president and creative director at Sesame Workshop, recalls attending one of Davis\u2019s first meetings, when Johnson was president of animation and preschool at Nickelodeon. One of the Geena Davis Institute\u2019s researchers presented data regarding the amount of dialogue women had, what kinds of jobs they held, and how sexualized they were.\n\n\u201cI just remember being so gobsmacked by the research and saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got to do something about this; I\u2019ve got to help,\u2019 \u201d Johnson recalls. Shortly there\u00adafter, she made sure all of Nickelodeon\u2019s board artists and writers in the animation department attended Davis\u2019s presentations, \u201cbecause animation historically has been a very male world.\u201d\n\nNancy Kanter, executive vice president of content and creative strategy for Disney Channels Worldwide, credits Davis with holding the industry accountable \u201cfor making bigger and faster changes [and compelling] all of us who work in programming for kids to take a hard look at not only how many girls are seen on screen but, importantly, how they are portrayed. What roles, what attitudes, what body types, what colors and what voices do they use are questions we now ask ourselves every day.\u201d\n\nThe latest study results, Davis says, vindicate her belief that data has always been \u201cthe magic key.\u201d When she meets with children\u2019s media creators, she says, \u201ctheir overwhelming reaction is, \u2018We\u2019re in this line of work because we care about kids and we thought we were doing right by kids, and this is horrifying.\u2019 These are people who wanted to do the right thing, thought they were, and were very motivated to change.\u201d\n\nDavis and Di Nonno are quick to point out that not everything has been fixed. There are still significant discrepancies in female representation when it comes to supporting and minor characters on kids\u2019 shows (43.1 percent of supporting characters included in the study were female, while 56.9 percent were male), and girls and women are still more prone to being hypersexualized on screen.\n\nOne of Di Nonno\u2019s pet peeves is that female characters still aren\u2019t allowed to be as funny as the guys. \u201cEvery time I meet with a kids\u2019 content person and they\u2019re developing shows, I say, \u2018Make the female characters funny,\u2019 \u201d she says, adding that too often, strength is confused with self-seriousness. \u201cIn the real world, statistics [suggest] that men who are funny are rewarded, while women who are funny are dinged for it.\u201d\n\nDavis says she intends to \u201cdouble down\u201d on urging the writers, producers, directors and other key executives she meets with to make as much progress with supporting and minor characters as they have with leads. \u201cThey\u2019re thinking big, which is good,\u201d she notes, \u201cbut I clearly need to really help them refocus on the [larger] population.\u201d Without that focus, she says, a damaging distortion \u2014 \u201cthat we don\u2019t take up half the space in the world and do half of the interesting and important things\u201d \u2014 will be perpetuated.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m focused on what kids see first,\u201d she explains. \u201cI believe that we are unwittingly training generation after generation to see women and girls as second-class citizens. I believe it impacts every aspect of our society \u2014 leadership and promotions and pay and everything.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough real-life women role models to inspire change in our culture, so we need them in fiction,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd the great thing is, as much as media images can cause problems, because they\u2019re so powerful, they can be the cure for the problems they\u2019re creating.\u201d\n\nRead more by Ann Hornaday:\n\nWant to know who will rule the upcoming awards season?
