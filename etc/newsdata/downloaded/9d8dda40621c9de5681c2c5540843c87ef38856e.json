However, the city attorney\u2019s office dropped the charges within hours of the initial event, according to a Fox News report.\n\nThursday\u2019s court filing stated:\n\nDespite repeated demands that Ms. Daniels fulfill her contractual obligations and pay for the millions of dollars in legal fees and costs she has enjoyed for her benefit over the last approximate 19 months, including in this case, she has refused. Instead, Ms. Daniels maintains that because she is a \u2018celebrity,\u2019 she is entitled to free legal services and costs, and when confronted with her repeated failure to pay, she believes that she is entitled to manufacture and fabricate facts designed to impugn the reputation of her counsel and falsely accuse him of a multitude of acts. But the law does not work the way Ms. Daniels wishes. Avenatti\u2019s attorney, Tom Warren, reportedly said his client did great work for Daniels, all while \u201cunder intense pressure and scrutiny.\u201d \u201cHe made significant personal sacrifices for her benefit. He deserves to be paid by her, not criticized,\u201d Warren concluded.\n\nOn May 22, Breitbart News reported Avenatti was charged for defrauding the porn star after federal prosecutors in New York City said he \u201cused a doctored document to divert about $300,000 that Daniels was supposed to get from a book deal, then used the money for personal and business expenses.\u201d\n\nHowever, prosecutors claimed only half of the money was repaid.\n\nOnce the charges were announced, Avenatti defended himself on Twitter by stating, \u201cNo monies relating to Ms. Daniels were ever misappropriated or mishandled. She received millions of dollars worth of legal services and we spent huge sums in expenses. She directly paid only $100.00 for all that she received.\u201d\n\n\u201cI look forward to a jury hearing the evidence,\u201d he concluded.", "description": "Attorney Michael Avenatti has filed a claim against Stormy Daniels alleging that she owes him more than $2 million in unpaid legal fees.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/GettyImages-1125223552.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
