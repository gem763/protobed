Chris Coons (D-DE) that Pence \u201cwas working the same vein of opportunity the president himself was working\u201d in urging Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThe vice president now according to reporting seems to be engaged in the same thing Trump was engaged in which is basically shaking down a foreign leader to get dirt on a political candidate, the candidate you\u2019re supporting, Joe Biden,\u201d Matthews stated. \u201cShouldn\u2019t he be the subject of an impeachment inquiry as well at this point?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I think it\u2019s important we focus on the facts here,\u201d Coons replied.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking the facts,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cThe facts now point that he \u2014 and not showing up to the inauguration, for his conversation with President Zelensky. He was working the same vein of opportunity the president himself was working, to leverage the need of that country for foreign military assistance, particularly weapons to use against tanks to get dirt on the candidate you support.\u201d\n\nLater in the show, Matthews asked network analyst David Corn about the \u201cconundrum\u201d of Pence having been \u201cinvolved in the same cabal\u201d as Trump.\n\n\u201cWhat about the conundrum here? If this president is impeached, which I think is pretty likely right now, and if he\u2019s removed from office, which there\u2019s less chance of that perhaps, but if he is removed from office in favor of Mike Pence, Mike Pence is involved in the same cabal which is using U.S. Foreign policies to get dirt on rivals,\u201d he stated.\n\n(h/t Newsbusters)\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "Wednesday on MSNBC's \"Hardball,\" anchor Chris Matthews pushed for Vice President Mike Pence to be \"subject of an impeachment inquiry\" in addition to | Clips", "authors": ["Trent Baker"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/matthews-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
