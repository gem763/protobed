Zelensky denied Perry asked him to dismiss the head of the state-run gas company in comments to the Kyiv Post on Thursday. POLITICO has reported Perry intends to depart the administration within months, though he denied the report earlier this week.\n\nThe subpoena demands records and communications related to the May inauguration of Zelensky, for which Perry led the U.S. delegation. It seeks records connected to a host of meetings abroad and at the White House that Perry attended along with senior Ukrainian officials. And it requests all records related to \u201cproposed or actual transactions, investments, or projects relating to liquified natural gas (LNG) in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Perry acknowledged asking Trump to make the July 25 call to Zelensky that\u2019s at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. He also said he\u2019d discussed corruption broadly with Zelensky as part of an effort to make energy investment in the country more attractive, but has vehemently denied ever bringing up Biden or his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cNot once as God as my witness, not once was a Biden name \u2014 not the former vice president, not his son \u2014 ever mentioned,\u201d he told the Christian Broadcasting Network.\n\nNews reports suggest associates of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani had sought the changes to the Naftogaz board to gain a foothold in the country\u2019s energy sector. Those associates, Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, were arrested Thursday on campaign finance and conspiracy charges. The indictment alleged that Fruman and Parnas orchestrated a straw donation scheme to help fund Republican campaigns and organizations from foreign donors \u2014 and that they pushed for the ouster of former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Yovanovitch is set to be deposed Friday as part of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nPerry was the lone sitting Republican governor to endorse Giuliani during his 2008 presidential run. The subpoena asks for records related to all \u201cmeetings and discussions\u201d between the two men.\n\nAlso sought under the subpoena are records concerning the decision to withhold military assistance to Ukraine, including governmental meetings and any notes that resulted from them.\n\nThe subpoena has a deadline of Oct. 18.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/4e/cd/2bf5357b43bc998f1556d0aeaaff/191010-rick-perry-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
