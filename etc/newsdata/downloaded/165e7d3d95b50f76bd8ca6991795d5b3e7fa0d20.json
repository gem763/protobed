A contingent of state Attorneys General, a majority of which are Democrats, Rep. David Cicilline, the chairman of the Democrat-controlled House Antitrust Subcommittee, and as nearly every Democrat running for their party\u2019s 2020 nomination, favor a massive reordering of the technology business. That restructuring includes, but is not limited to, the breakup of the biggest and most profitable firms like search powerhouse Google and social media behemoth Facebook.\n\nAny potential breakup of big tech would likely crush the stock prices of these companies given their structure and the hefty revenues they pull in from raking in user data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Republicans appear, at least for now, dead set against putting a stake through the heart of big tech. That's despite Silicon Valley\u2019s long-held reputation as a bastion of progressive politics. A spokesman for Sen. Lee told FOX Business exclusively he has no plans to lead an effort that would break up tech.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned about privacy, data misuse and bias, but that doesn\u2019t fall under the antitrust law. Big isn\u2019t necessarily bad,\" Lee said. \"It matters, but it\u2019s not the only element. Senator Lee looks at the facts and the law and whether a company engages in anti-competitive behavior.\u201d\n\nThe Republican positions on Big Tech is now being used by Google \u2014 maybe the biggest target in the crackdown along with social-media titan Facebook \u2014 to assuage fears that the probe will erase tens of billions of dollars in market value from stocks that have been Wall Street\u2019s best performers, people with knowledge of the matter tell FOX Business. Specifically, tech companies are telling investors not to bank on worse case scenarios that would involve breaking up the likes of Google and Facebook given the position of Lee and senior members of the GOP controlled Senate, these people say.\n\nSpokesmen for Google, Facebook and the Justice Department had no comment.\n\n\u201cOne of the things the tech companies are pointing out is that Congress is too slow-moving to make any immediate change \u2026 and McConnell and Lee aren\u2019t going to take antitrust action against tech,\u201d one tech insider with direct knowledge of the matter told FOX Business.\n\nTech companies are also spreading the word that they have other political factors in their favor as investors try and navigate how much the multiple inquiries and possible new regulations could affect profits and stock prices of what had been some of the world's most profitable companies. At least until the 2020 election, the politically divided House and the Senate are unlikely to accomplish anything of substance, the tech companies argue.\n\nUnless the Democrats sweep the House and Senate and the presidency in 2020, which appears unlikely, gridlock will continue for some time. That means serious regulation that would crimp profits or a breakup of any of the tech titans won\u2019t happen for the foreseeable future, they say.\n\nTech company officials also note that in previous investigations, like the 2012 Federal Trade Commission probe into Google, agencies conceded there had been no antitrust violations.\n\nStill, it remains unclear how big tech's embrace of the GOP will be taken by the rank-and-file tech employee. Certainly, companies like Amazon and Google have been wise to spread their corporate PAC contributions to both sides of the aisle in Congress. Apple CEO Tim Cook and President Trump enjoy a warm relationship, and Trump recently praised Cook for calling him directly on major issues. Billionaire investor Peter Thiel, the co-founder of Paypal and a Facebook board member, is both one of Silicon Valley\u2019s top investors and a supporter of President Trump.\n\nBut employees of the companies have been and continue to overwhelmingly donate to Democrat candidates while pushing progressive causes. In 2017 Google went so far as to fire James Damore, then an engineer, for circulating an internal memo that criticized the company's progressive policies.\n\nMoreover, some Wall Street executives are less sanguine about the future of big tech in the current regulatory climate. Financial insiders tell FOX Business they believe Google, Facebook, and others are underestimating both the scale of the regulatory crackdown and the disdain regulators of both parties have for them. If Democrats control Congress and the presidency after the 2020 election, the likelihood that Google and Facebook being broken up grows significantly.\n\nAnd while the GOP may be less inclined to break up big tech, Republicans and President Trump, of course, have eagerly joined the chorus of tech critics that have amassed around the powerful industry in recent years amid public fears that companies are misusing private data, and other issues. The Trump Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission have launched extensive probes into issues involving the tech giants including possible antitrust violations.\n\nMany GOP state attorneys general have joined the likes of New York\u2019s Letitia James in the state probe of industry abuses. Antitrust is far from the only consideration on the agenda. Broadly speaking, regulators are examining four areas of alleged tech misbehavior: privacy, antitrust, tax avoidance, and national security.\n\n\u201cThe intent of many regulators is to break up big tech \u2014 not to release value but to be as punitive as possible,\u201d said Charles Myers, chairman of Signum Global Advisors.\n\nMyers, who has been monitoring the impact of the regulation on the stocks of big tech companies, said that regulators believe that the AT&T breakup is what allowed tech to become successful, so there might be a similar effect if tech is broken up today.\n\n\"Thus far, Google has been able to escape a fair bit of criticism because they're good at PR, but that will change when lawmakers and users alike realize Google has allowed Gmail to be accessed by third parties and even possibly foreign governments.\"\n\nTicker Security Last Change %Chg AAPL APPLE INC. 218.82 -1.07 -0.49% AMZN AMAZON.COM INC. 1,725.45 -14.39 -0.83%\n\nThat said, big tech companies are spinning a more positive message to investors amid the regulatory firestorm. They point to the differences between the GOP and the Democrats in their approach to regulation and enforcement of antitrust laws. The Democrats including various 2020 presidential candidates, have called for the wholesale breakup of Google, Facebook, and maybe others like Amazon, and Apple, while the GOP Congress and even the White House has focused more on forcing these companies to eliminate what is viewed as liberal bias in Google's search and Facebook's news feeds.\n\nMakan Delrahim, the Justice Department's antitrust chief, has said that he doesn\u2019t view tech's massive size and reach \u2014 these are some of the world's biggest companies that impact lives of nearly every American \u2014 as a reason to simply break them up.\n\n\"A company \u2014 just because they've been successful and have gotten big \u2014 do not violate the antitrust laws,\" Delharim told FOX Business in April. \"It\u2019s only when they've engaged in certain conduct. It\u2019s important for us to pay attention to it and make certain they don\u2019t harm competition.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Companies like Facebook and Google are looking to conservative senators as their last best hope.", "authors": ["Lydia Moynihan", "Charles Gasparino"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/capitol-building-companies-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
