It had yellowish brown fur, powerful jaws and a pouch for its young like a kangaroo.\n\nAmong eight sightings in the past three years was one from a couple from Western Australia visiting the island of Tasmania in February, who said they saw one of the creatures crossing the road.\n\nThe animal \u201cturned and looked at the vehicle a couple of times\u201d and \u201cwas in clear view for 12-15 seconds,\u201d the report read. Both people in the car \u201care 100 per cent certain that the animal they saw was a thylacine.\u201d\n\nIt had stripes down its back, the report read.\n\nAnother report the same month described a striped \u201ccat-like creature\u201d moving through the mist in the distance, CNN reported.\n\n\u201cI am accustomed to coming across most animals working on rural farms ... and I have never come across an animal anything close to what I saw in Tasmania that day,\u201d the witness said.\n\nIn 2017, another driver reported seeing a possible thylacine near in northwestern Tasmania. He \u201cseemed certain that if it was a cat it was a bloody big one,\u201d the report said.\n\nMost recently, in July, a man in southern Tasmania, near the state capital of Hobart, reported seeing a footprint that seemed to match that of the Tasmanian tiger.\n\nNative to both Tasmania and the Australian mainland, it was the only member of the Thylacinidae family to survive into modern times, according to the Australian Museum.\n\nEuropean colonists in the 19th century killed thousands of thylacines for attacking sheep.\n\nWhat was thought to be the last one of its kind died in Hobart Zoo in 1936, although there have been regular claims of unsubstantiated sightings, giving the animal an almost mythical status in Tasmanian culture.\n\nTasmania\u2019s Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment released the document detailing the eight reported sightings.\n\nIn 2002, scientists at the Australian Museum replicated thylacine DNA, opening the door to potentially reviving the species with cloning technology.\n\nRead more\n\nTasmanian devil colony untouched by cancer wiping out species found", "description": "Eight reported sightings of a creature believed to be extinct are forcing experts to wonder whether it could still be alive.The Tasmanian tiger, a large striped marsupial carnivore with almost Loch Ness Monster status Down Under, was thought to have died out in 1936, when the last one known died in captivity", "authors": ["Jane Dalton"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5pIpbgle8F2XHJBXq8jZxw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/2bb3b24f8adcfd0dde2d635c13ec39f9", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
