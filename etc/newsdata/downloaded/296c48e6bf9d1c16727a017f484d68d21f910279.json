In several decades, parts of Florida and Texas could experience a heat index for five or more months per year exceeding 100 degrees, \u201cwith most of these days even surpassing 105 degrees.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s own studies confirm this. Typical five-day heat waves in the U.S. will be 12 degrees warmer by mid-century alone, according to the U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA), which the White House itself reviewed and approved last November.\n\nOther studies also show the devastating heat-related impacts the nation and the world face from Trump\u2019s policies of abandoning the Paris climate deal, undoing Obama-era climate rules, and boosting carbon pollution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, America (and much of the world) will start seeing monster \u201chumid heat waves\u201d \u2014 where the heat index hits a potentially fatal 131 degrees \u2014 every other year by century\u2019s end.\n\nHeat wave records have been breaking at an astonishing rate in recent days around the country and around the globe.\n\nWe know that human-caused (anthropogenic) carbon pollution and global warming is now the leading factor driving such records. A 2016 study in Nature Scientific Reports, led by climatologist Michael Mann, concluded, \u201cIn summary, our results suggest that the recent record temperature years are roughly 600 to 130,000 times more likely to have occurred under conditions of anthropogenic [climate change] than in its absence.\u201d\n\nThe extreme heat waves in Europe, Asia, and now the U.S. are driven by \u201cpersistent (\u2018stuck\u2019) extreme weather patterns,\u201d as Mann explained to ThinkProgress in an email. His research and others have shown that \u201ca widely meandering, slowed jetstream\u201d favors these stalled weather extremes and that \u201cthis pattern is favored by human-caused climate change, giving us more frequent persistent weather extremes like we are seeing right now.\u201d\n\nSo, what about the future?\n\nThe congressionally-mandated NCA \u2014 the \u201cauthoritative assessment of the science of climate change, with a focus on the United States\u201d \u2014 projects under its \u201chigher emissions\u201d scenario a stunning 8 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit average warming over the interior of this country by late in the century.\n\nPROJECTED CHANGES IN ANNUAL AVERAGE TEMPERATURES (2070\u20132099) WITH STRONG CLIMATE POLICIES (LEFT) AND WITH President Trump's CURRENT POLICIES (RIGHT). CREDIT: NATIONAL CLIMATE ASSESSMENT\n\nBut the NCA also makes clear that temperature extremes rise at an even faster rate than average temperatures.\n\nFor instance, the average temperature over the country is projected to rise about 9 degrees by late in the century (2071-2100) in the high emissions scenario, which is one where the Paris climate agreement fails and climate action stalls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, also under this scenario, the temperature of the warmest five-day period during a once-in-a-decade heat wave is projected to rise some 12 degrees just by mid-century (2036\u20132065). So we\u2019ll soon be suffering through even worse heat waves than we are now seeing \u2014 and our children will see even more devastating ones.\n\nThe NCA scientists explain that to achieve the low-emissions scenario, not only does every nation \u2014 including the United States \u2014 have to meet its Paris climate pledge. But, we all also have to keep ratcheting down the targets \u201cwith continually increasing ambition\u201d until global emissions of carbon pollution are near zero by century\u2019s end.\n\nCurrent extreme heat waves \u2014 and the droughts and wildfires that accompany them \u2014 are already wreaking havoc on this country and the world.\n\nTragically, Trump\u2019s policies will make such heat waves simply the normal climate, bringing with it new monster heat waves and catastrophic impacts.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NOAA-Heat-Index.jpeg?w=1199&h=790&crop=1"}
