It\u2019s the best clickbait in the world: someone is spying on us.\u201d\n\nThe teams have met 41 times since their first encounter in 1905, the All Blacks dominating the fixture with 33 wins to England\u2019s seven and one draw.\n\nNew Zealand have won all three of their World Cup matches against England, including the 1995 semi-final when the late Jonah Lomu memorably flattened Tony Underwood and Mike Catt on his way to the try-line in the All Blacks\u2019 45-29 win.\n\nBut the All Blacks won by just a point when they last met, in London a year ago, and several of the England players were involved in the drawn British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand in 2017.\n\nThe two nations have already played out one classic sports encounter this year: the nerve-shredding Cricket World Cup final in July, which England won on a boundary count-back after the scores were tied at the end of the match and after a super over.\n\nNeither coach will want that kind of a rollercoaster but even the unflappable Hansen acknowledged the excitement felt on both sides.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope the game lives up to the expectation that both teams will have, and is one for the ages,\u201d he said.", "description": "Yokohama (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Reigning champions New Zealand and England clash in a heavyweight Rugby World Cup semi-final on Saturday after a build-up", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/43af5e_new-zealand-are-seeking-straight-world-cup-title-heavyweights-new-zealand-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
