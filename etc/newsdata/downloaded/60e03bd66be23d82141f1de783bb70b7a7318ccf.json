It's the first trial to ever show that a [medical] treatment can reduce the risk of traumatic brain injury patients dying.\n\n\"This is the first time that we have seen a beneficial effect. It will have huge implications worldwide.\n\n\"It's a widely available drug, it's relatively cheap and it's really simple to give.\"\n\nCo-researcher Dr Ben Bloom, consultant in emergency medicine at Barts Health NHS Trust, said: \"Treating traumatic brain injury is extremely challenging, with very few treatment options available for patients.\n\n\"Thanks to these latest results, which are applicable to patients with head injuries of any cause and of all demographics, clinicians now have a potentially powerful new treatment available to them.\"\n\nDr Nicola Magrini, from the World Health Organization, said it would carefully evaluate the findings and consider whether to add tranexamic acid for head injuries to its Essential Medicines List - drugs it considers important enough to be made widely available to patients across the world.", "description": "A cheap, common drug could save hundreds of thousands of lives a year if used routinely, doctors say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/008E/production/_109224100_img_2704-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
