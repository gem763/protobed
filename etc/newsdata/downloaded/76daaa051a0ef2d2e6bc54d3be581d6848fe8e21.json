You know you deserve the best, and not a tad bit afraid to give up anyone who is less than a perfect fit. Settling down for less is not one of your special skills. However, with that fantasy of a happily-ever-after in your head, you fight for your relationship till it takes its last breath. Let the fury of a failed relationship pass. It can be harder if you didn\u2019t initiate the breakup, as rejection scars for your ego. But, as there\u2019s no window for self-doubt, you are able to move onto better things quickly. Simply avoid contact with your ex and give yourself some time and space.\n\nRemove your rage by penning down a letter\u2014pouring all your anger, disappointment, and the left-over love for him. Instead of posting it, burn the letter and watch all the negative feelings turn to ashes.", "description": "How to overcome a breakup for Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/jul/breakup-01sm-thumb1563440906.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-19"}
