Among other things, the city says \"use of the terms 'illegal alien' and 'illegals,' with the intent to demean, humiliate, or offend a person or persons in the workplace, amounts to unlawful discrimination.\"\n\nOffenders can be fined up to $250,000 for each violation if they discriminate in employment, housing or other public facilities.\n\n\"We take immense pride in our city's diversity and the immigrant communities that call New York City home,\" said Deputy Mayor Phil Thompson in a statement. \"This new legal enforcement guidance will help ensure that no New Yorker is discriminated against based on their immigration status or national origin. \"\n\nThe city's Commission on Human Rights \u2014 the agency dedicated to enforcing the New York City Human Rights Law \u2014 released the updated rules last week dealing with discrimination on the basis of perceived or actual immigration status and national origin in public accommodations, employment and housing.\n\nThe commission's guidance also states that harassing or discriminating against someone for their use of another language or their limited English proficiency, or threatening to call ICE on a person based on a discriminatory motive, are considered to be violations of the law.\n\nThe protections also extend to people using private and public facilities, including businesses such as restaurants, fitness clubs, stores, nightclubs and other public spaces.\n\nFines of up to $250,000 can be assessed for each act of willful discrimination, the commission said, adding that damages are available to complainants.\n\nThe commission provided some specific examples of how the guidelines would apply. For instance, violations could include:\n\nHarassing a restaurant patron because of their accent;\n\nRefusing to make repairs on an apartment occupied by an immigrant family and threatening to call ICE if they complain;\n\nPaying a lower wage or withholding wages to workers because of their immigration status;\n\nHarassing a store customer by telling them to stop speaking their language and demanding they speak English.\n\nThe commission noted that 3.2 million New York City residents were born outside of the United States, representing 37% of the city's population.\n\n\"The New York City Human Rights Law is one of the most protective in the nation,\" said Carmelyn P. Malalis, commissioner and chair of the Commission on Human Rights. \"It protects everyone, regardless of their immigration status.\"\n\n\"In the face of increasingly hostile national rhetoric, we will do everything in our power to make sure our treasured immigrant communities are able to live with dignity and respect, free of harassment and bias,\" she added.", "description": "Discriminating against someone for their use of another language, or threatening to call ICE on a person based on a discriminatory motive, could lead to a $250,000 fine", "authors": ["Christopher Brito"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/01/49cd2e2e-e5a6-4337-a9ff-5d806756998a/thumbnail/1200x630g3/27397e2880c03d851833b385011e0ba3/gettyimages-1003468610.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
