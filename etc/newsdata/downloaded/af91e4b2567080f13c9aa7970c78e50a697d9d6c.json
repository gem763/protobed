In fact, the prolific Aussie scorer had absolutely no idea that league president Amanda Duffy was about to announce the winner of the distinction when we spoke Friday afternoon.\n\nI broke the news to Kerr \u2014 one of five finalists for the award \u2014 10 minutes before the ceremony. When I did, she practically shrugged.\n\n\"There's something bigger in two days, so I'm mainly just focused on that,\" she said. \"I didn't even know it was coming up, so.\"\n\nSam Kerr #20 of Australia celebrates her goal to take a 6-1 lead over Brazil during the 2017 Tournament Of Nations at StubHub Center on August 3, 2017 in Carson, California. Harry How/Getty Images\n\nKerr paced the Red Stars with 18 goals during the regular season to break her own record and earn the NWSL Golden Boot for the third consecutive year \u2014 and she did so despite missing four games to compete at the 2019 World Cup in France.\n\nOf course, the Australian national team captain was also honored with a spot on the NWSL's controversial 2019 Best XI lineup, but individual accolades evidently mean little to Kerr. She consistently steered our conversation away from herself to laud her Chicago teammates, coaching staff, team doctors, and fans, so it was no surprise when she shrugged off the praise she received during the MVP trophy presentation ceremony.\n\n\"Obviously I don't do this by myself,\" Kerr began, motioning to her teammates who were looking on. \"Eighteen goals doesn't come from just one player, so thank you to my teammates... They allow me to be the best player I can all year so it's a huge team effort.\"\n\n\"This means really nothing if we don't win on Sunday,\" she added.\n\nLike her club, Kerr will make her first appearance in an NWSL title game at Sunday afternoon's match. The crafty forward \u2014 who recorded five of Australia's nine goals through four World Cup games this summer \u2014 scored the Red Stars' lone goal just eight minutes into their win against Tobin Heath's Portland Thorns last Sunday.\n\nThe victory marked Chicago's first time advancing past the NWSL semifinal in five consecutive tries, and Kerr and her teammates had the privelege of finally breaking through in front of their home crowd. The league's all-time leading scorer certainly acknowledges that her Windy City squad is peaking at the right time, as Sunday's 1-0 dub extended the Red Stars' winning streak to six straight games\n\n\"We've been training really well and things have just been going our way which doesn't normally happen with this Chicago team,\" Kerr said. \"We feel like this is our time.\"\n\nFans at home can watch the NWSL championship game \u2014 in which Kerr's Red Stars will take on the reigning champion North Carolina Courage at WakeMed Soccer Park in Cary, North Carolina \u2014 Sunday at 3:30 p.m. on ESPN.", "description": "When I broke the news that the NWSL's president was scheduled to present the honor right after our conversation, Sam Kerr shrugged indifferently.", "authors": ["Meredith Cash"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db3ca6ddee0195fce47e452?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
