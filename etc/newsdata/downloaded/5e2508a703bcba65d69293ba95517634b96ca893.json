He will then retire on March 31 later that year.\n\nLooney, 49, will continue with his current role until February 5, at which point he will take the reins from Dudley and join the BP board.\n\n\"It has been the privilege of a lifetime to serve this company and work in this industry for the past four decades. I have worked with so many committed people from all over the world \u2014 both inside and outside BP \u2014 and I am enormously proud of all the things we have achieved together to provide energy for the world,\" Dudley said in a statement on Friday.\n\n\"Bernard (Looney) is a terrific choice to lead the company next. He knows BP and our industry as well as anyone but is creative and not bound by traditional ways of working. I have no doubt that he will thoughtfully lead BP through the transition to a low carbon future,\" he added.\n\nShares of BP are down more than 18% over a 12-month period.\n\nThis is a breaking news story.
