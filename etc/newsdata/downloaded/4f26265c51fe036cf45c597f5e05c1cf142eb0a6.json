Mr. Trump said the ISIS leader killed himself and some of his children \"like a coward\" by detonating a suicide vest in a tunnel on a compound in the Idlib province of northwestern Syria after U.S. special operations forces breached the walls and took out many of his fighters.\n\nAsked how the pledge to continue an \"unrelenting\" campaign against ISIS squares with the president's abrupt decision earlier this month to withdraw all U.S. troops from northern Syria, Pence said the administration has kept some forces in other parts of Syria and in Iraq to continue fighting the terrorist organization.\n\nThe decision to retreat from northern Syria elicited withering criticism from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress, who believed it would leave U.S.-allied Kurdish forces vulnerable to Turkish invasion from the north, which occurred soon after the American drawdown.\n\nLawmakers have also warned that the decision could lead to a resurgence of ISIS, as the Kurds were the main fighting force on the ground in the campaign to defeat ISIS and had imprisoned thousands of ISIS militants and supporters.\n\nBut Pence on Sunday continued to defend the decision.\n\n\"The president looked at the circumstances where we had American forces essentially providing a safe zone patrol on the Turkish border, \" he said. \"That was not the mission.\"\n\nAlthough the president in his remarks on Sunday morning seemed to downplay the role of Kurdish forces in the operation that led to al-Baghdadi's death, Pence himself highlighted the assistance of the main U.S-allied Kurdish group in Syria.\n\n\"This operation last night though was a real testament to the relationships that we've forged with Syrian Democratic Forces,\" he said.", "description": "\"Last night, the president of the United States proved to the world that our fight against ISIS is unrelenting,\" the vice president told \"Face the Nation\"", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/27/abfc4952-ba99-4fe4-8cca-db2a878df515/thumbnail/1200x630/907f56cbb9f9b984f348d55a9f741cbb/pence2.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
