Sharon\u2019s shocked, but as Ben departed the E20 office, it became apparent that Sharon now has the leverage she needs.\n\nWill this new information finally put an end to Mel\u2019s demands?\n\nWill Sharon counteract Mel\u2019s blackmail with blackmail?\n\nEither way, Sharon has the upper hand, so Mel had better watch out!\n\nEastEnders continues Thursday 31stOctober at 7:30pm on BBC One.\n\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: Mel Owen exposes Sharon Mitchell and Keanu Taylor\u2019s secret publicly?\n\nMORE: 12 soap spoiler pictures: EastEnders engagement, Coronation Street feud, Emmerdale betrayal, Hollyoaks revenge\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "With Mel proving to be a thorn in Sharon's side, Ben gave her the leverage she needs to get the upper hand.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ben-mitchell-and-sharon-mitchell-in-eastenders_1572347981.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
