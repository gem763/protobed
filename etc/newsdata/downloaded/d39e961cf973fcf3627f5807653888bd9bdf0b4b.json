We're glad you asked", "language": "en", "text": "What is cross-training, exactly? We're glad you asked Here's what it really means and how to do it.\n\nCross-training sounds like something reserved for serious athletes and feels like a bit of an old-school term that\u2019s been around since moms started lacing up their sneaks for step aerobics. But it\u2019s still super-important, no matter if you\u2019re a casual barre class-goer or an ultramarathoner.\n\nThe good news: You\u2019re likely already doing some sort of cross-training whether you realise it or not. \u201cMost everyone cross-trains \u2014 it just means training with a few different types of exercise, movement, or modalities,\u201d says Mike Donavanik, founder of Sweat Factor. \u201cOften, people do their \u2018main thing\u2019 and have outlying activities that they dabble in.\u201d\n\nThe catch: You can\u2019t just drop in to workouts all willy-nilly. The key to getting the most out of cross-training is to think about your exercise goals and what kind of side sessions will complement them. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about what cross-training is, what it\u2019s good for, and how exactly you should be doing it.\n\nWhat is cross-training?\n\n\u201cCross-training has been a very loosely used term for randomised training modalities \u2014 both high and low intensity \u2014 for decades,\u201d says Heidi Powell, personal trainer and co-creator of the Transform app. It came back in a big way in recent years with the rise of one workout in particular. \u201cCrossFit totally changed the paradigm of cross-training and gave it a massively dominant brand and style, especially the connotation that cross-training is all high intensity,\u201d says Powell.\n\nCross-training doesn\u2019t have to be super-intense, though. At its core, it\u2019s all about pairing workouts that will support each other. It might be mixing yoga into your triathlon training schedule or adding swim sessions between your favourite boot camp classes.\n\nREAD MORE: Here\u2019s Why Runners Should Do Cross-Training\n\nWhat are the benefits of cross-training?\n\nFor one, it makes you more well rounded. \u201cCross-training will help you increase strength, power, speed, endurance, agility, and balance, all of which translates across all sports and your everyday life,\u201d says Powell. Bonus: Mixing up your activity will also help you bust gym boredom.\n\nAnd maybe the best news: Cross-training might just let you say so long to your PT; athletes who specialise in one sport had an 85 percent higher chance of getting injures than those who did multiple activities, according to 2017 research from the University of Wisconsin.\n\nWhat are the best kinds of cross-training workouts?\n\nMaybe the easiest kind of cross-training to squeeze into your already packed schedule is a workout that combines cardio and strength into one efficient session.\n\nBut keep in mind what you really want to get out of it. \u201cThe best kinds are the ones that change the most, but also the ones that are properly programmed for your specific goals,\u201d says Powell. If your main priority is gearing up for a marathon, the right kind of cross-training for you will be different than if your go-to exercise is hitting the yoga mat each morning. Consider scheduling at least a few sessions with a personal trainer to help you outline your goals and how to stay on track to reach them.\n\nHow often should you cross-train?\n\nAs a general rule, aim for a couple times a week. But how often you schedule mix-it-up sweat sessions does depend somewhat on how quickly you can bounce back afterward. \u201cIf you\u2019re younger, get a lot of sleep, and eat well, you can train more frequently than someone who is older, gets inadequate sleep, or doesn\u2019t nourish their body with the nutrients needed for recovery,\u201d Powell explains.\n\nAre there any risks?\n\nWhile one of the benefits of varying your workouts is a reduced risk of injury, it\u2019s possible to wind up hurt from cross-training, too, if you\u2019re not careful. \u201cIf you cross-train too much, you\u2019ll never master proper form because you keep bopping around to different activities,\u201d warns Donavanik.\n\nRather than trying to do something different every day, he recommends sticking to just a couple regularly scheduled routines. \u201cPick maybe two activities at a time to alternate between \u2014 don\u2019t try to do lifting, soul cycle, yoga, Pilates, barre all in one week,\u201d he says. Instead, have a main activity that\u2019s your anchor \u2014 and one you\u2019ll really master \u2014 and mix in a complimentary workout twice a week.\n\nAnother risk to consider: When you\u2019re adding a new activity to support your favourite form of workout, don\u2019t dive in too quickly. \u201cMost people try to lift way too heavy, way too fast \u2014 they jump straight into the high-intensity concept of cross-training and forget the two main foundations: proper form and being able to maintain that proper form throughout the duration of the exercise,\u201d says Powell. Start slowly and get guidance from a class instructor or trainer to make sure your new cross-training is helping, not hurting, your goals.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "Here's what it really means and how to do it.", "authors": ["Laurel Leicht"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7466/74b0beb8e755412e82b7ca2613059c9e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-10"}
