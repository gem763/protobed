COLI AND WHY IS IT DANGEROUS? E. coli (Escherichia coli) are bacteria that generally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. Infections can occur after coming into contact with the faeces of humans or animals, or by eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water. Symptoms of an E.coli infection include bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting. In rare cases, sufferers can develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This is a condition in which there is an abnormal destruction of blood platelets and red blood cells. According to the Mayo Clinic, the damaged blood cells can clog the kidney's filtering system, resulting in life-threatening kidney failure. No treatment currently exists to treat these infections. They usually disappear within one week, but medical professionals recommend resting and drinking fluids to help prevent dehydration and fatigue.\n\nProfessor Livermore and colleagues sequenced the genomes of ESBL-producing E.coli for the study, published in journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases.\n\nSamples were extracted from human bloodstream infections, human faeces and human sewerage, as well as beef, pork and chicken.\n\nThey found that ESBL-E.coli strains extracted from the human samples were similar to one another but differed to the strains present in animals.\n\nThis meant there was 'little crossover' of ESBL-E.coli from animals to humans, Professor Livermore and team said.\n\nThey added it is still important to follow good hygiene practices while cooking food because other infections can still be picked up through eating.\n\nBut Professor Livermore said: 'Here - in the case of ESBL-E.coli - it's much more important to wash your hands after going to the toilet.'\n\nProfessor Neil Woodford, of Public Health England, said: 'In order to tackle antibiotic resistance, we not only need to drive down inappropriate prescribing, but reduce infections in the first place.\n\n'In order to limit serious, antibiotic resistant E.coli bloodstream infections, we must focus on thorough hand washing and good infection control, as well as the effective management of urinary tract infections.\n\n'Prudent use of antibiotics is essential in both animals and humans. Antibiotics are a finite resource. We need them to continue to work when we get sick.'\n\nAntibiotic resistant strains of E. coli are more likely to be spread by not washing your hands after going to the toilet than by eating undercooked meat, scientists say.", "description": "Researchers at the University of East Anglia found the majority of super-strains of the common bug are spread between humans and not through eating raw chicken, beef or pork.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/16/20043348-0-image-a-62_1571759689916.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
