Between doctors and our organization, we just wanted to make sure everything was right,\" Edmonton head coach Dave Tippett said. \"He's practised hard for two weeks. He's itching to play.\"\n\nAdin Hill made 39 saves as the Coyotes came away with a 4-2 victory over the Oilers.\n\nMcDavid logged 19 minutes 42 seconds of ice time \u2014 including three minutes on the power play \u2014 and registered two shots on goal.\n\nMcDavid tore his left posterior cruciate ligament when he crashed into a goalpost in April against the Calgary Flames.\n\nThe 22-year-old centre from Newmarket, Ont., had said he hoped to return to game action during the exhibition schedule. Edmonton now has two games left before their season opener next Wednesday against the Vancouver Canucks.\n\nBack in the lineup feels from Captain Connor \ud83d\ude00 <a href=\"https://t.co/tKoxNiNF8L\">pic.twitter.com/tKoxNiNF8L</a> \u2014@EdmontonOilers\n\n\"The bottom line is he's good for the game,\" Tippett said. \"That skill, speed, talent is good for the game. And he's a real good person to go with it.\"\n\nMcDavid finished second in league scoring with 116 points in 2018-19, but even that couldn't get the Oilers into the post-season as the franchise missed the playoffs for the third time in his four NHL campaigns.\n\nMcDavid led the league in scoring the previous two seasons.\n\nThis year, the Oilers have a new coach in Tippett and a new general manager in Ken Holland.\n\nMonahan, Bennett lead Flames past Jets\n\nSean Monahan and Sam Bennett scored for Calgary in a 2-0 win over the visiting Winnipeg Jets.\n\nMonahan and Bennett collected their second goals of the pre-season while goaltender David Rittich posted a 20-save shutout for the Flames (3-2-1).\n\nJets goaltender Eric Comrie allowed two goals on 20 shots over two periods. Mikhail Berdin repelled all 13 he faced in the third for Winnipeg (2-2-1).\n\nCalgary had more big names in its lineup \u2014 Monahan, Johnny Gaudreau, Mark Giordano \u2014 than the Jets, who were minus captain Blake Wheeler, forwards Mark Scheifele and Nikolaj Ehlers and top goaltender Connor Hellebuyck on Tuesday.\n\nBoth teams are trying to ink deals with key restricted free agents before the regular season begins \u2014 Patrik Laine and Kyle Connor for Winnipeg and Matthew Tkachuk for Calgary.\n\nTkachuk's absence gives Bennett top-six playing time on a line with Mikael Backlund and Michael Frolik.\n\nMilan Lucic, acquired in a July trade with the Edmonton Oilers, filled Tkachuk's net-front role for Calgary's top power-play unit Tuesday.\n\nAfter a scoreless first period, the hosts struck twice in a 33-second span starting with Monahan's power-play goal at 13:37.\n\nBennett shovelled the puck under Comrie's right pad on a feed from Backlund at 14:10.", "description": "Edmonton Oilers star Connor McDavid will play his first game tonight since suffering a knee injury in last year's season finale.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5295578.1569383857!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/mcdavid-connor-092419.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
