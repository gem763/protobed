REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe U.S. office-sharing startup was getting ready to launch an investor road show for its IPO this week, the sources said. It may now not go ahead with the listing this year, though no decision on the new timing has been taken, the sources added. The company has been under pressure to proceed with the stock market flotation to secure funding for its operations.\n\nWe Company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nIn the run-up to the launch of its IPO, We Company has faced concerns about its corporate governance standards, as well as the sustainability of its business model, which relies on a mix of long-term liabilities and short-term revenue, and how such a model would weather an economic downturn.\n\nReuters reported last week that We Company might seek a valuation in its IPO of between $10 billion and $12 billion, a dramatic discount to the $47 billion valuation it achieved in January.\n\nWere We Company to have pressed on with the IPO at such a low valuation, it would have represented a major turning point in the growth over the last decade of the venture capital industry, which has led to the rise of startups such as Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N), Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Airbnb Inc.\n\nIt would have meant that We Company would be valued at less than the $12.8 billion in equity it has raised since it was founded in 2010, according to data provider Crunchbase. And it would have been a blow to its biggest backer, Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), at a time when it is trying to amass $108 billion from investors for its second Vision Fund.\n\nSoftBank was discussing supporting the IPO by snapping up shares worth between $750 million and $1 billion, the sources said. However, We Company decided on Monday that even with SoftBank\u2019s support, the IPO would have raised a little over than $2 billion, short of its target of at least $3 billion.\n\nThis target is tied to a $6 billion credit line We Company secured from banks last month, that calls for an IPO to take place by the end of the year and raise at least $3 billion, one of the sources said.\n\nWere the New York-based company to fail to meet this target, it would need to secure alternative funding.\n\nThe sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the potential IPO delay.\n\nThe last time SoftBank invested in We Company was in January at the $47 billion valuation, injecting $2 billion of cash. It had been pushing the company to delay its IPO.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) had been tasked with leading We Company\u2019s IPO as underwriters.\n\nGOVERNANCE CHANGES\n\nWe Company\u2019s decision to delay its IPO indicates it did not feel confident that the corporate governance changes it unveiled on Friday, slightly loosening CEO and co-founder Adam Neumann\u2019s grip on the company, was enough to woo investors concerned about its lack of a path to profitability.\n\nWe Company had said it was making the changes \u201cin response to market feedback.\u201d It said Neumann\u2019s superior voting shares will decrease to 10 votes per share from 20, though he will retain majority control of the company.\n\nNeumann will also give the company any profit he receives from real estate deals he has entered in to with We Company. He will also limit his ability to sell shares in the second and third years after the IPO to no more than 10% of his stock.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Adam Neumann, CEO of WeWork, speaks to guests during the TechCrunch Disrupt event in Manhattan, in New York City, NY, U.S. May 15, 2017.
