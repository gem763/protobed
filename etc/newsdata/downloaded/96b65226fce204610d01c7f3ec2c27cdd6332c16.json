Unlike Keltner, who studies behaviors, Obhi studies brains. And when he put the heads of the powerful and the not-so-powerful under a transcranial-magnetic-stimulation machine, he found that power, in fact, impairs a specific neural process, \u201cmirroring,\u201d that may be a cornerstone of empathy. Which gives a neurological basis to what Keltner has termed the \u201cpower paradox\u201d: Once we have power, we lose some of the capacities we needed to gain it in the first place.\n\nThat loss in capacity has been demonstrated in various creative ways. A 2006 study asked participants to draw the letter E on their forehead for others to view\u2014a task that requires seeing yourself from an observer\u2019s vantage point. Those feeling powerful were three times more likely to draw the E the right way to themselves\u2014and backwards to everyone else (which calls to mind George W. Bush, who memorably held up the American flag backwards at the 2008 Olympics). Other experiments have shown that powerful people do worse at identifying what someone in a picture is feeling, or guessing how a colleague might interpret a remark.\n\nThe fact that people tend to mimic the expressions and body language of their superiors can aggravate this problem: Subordinates provide few reliable cues to the powerful. But more important, Keltner says, is the fact that the powerful stop mimicking others. Laughing when others laugh or tensing when others tense does more than ingratiate. It helps trigger the same feelings those others are experiencing and provides a window into where they are coming from. Powerful people \u201cstop simulating the experience of others,\u201d Keltner says, which leads to what he calls an \u201cempathy deficit.\u201d\n\nMirroring is a subtler kind of mimicry that goes on entirely within our heads, and without our awareness. When we watch someone perform an action, the part of the brain we would use to do that same thing lights up in sympathetic response. It might be best understood as vicarious experience. It\u2019s what Obhi and his team were trying to activate when they had their subjects watch a video of someone\u2019s hand squeezing a rubber ball.\n\nFor nonpowerful participants, mirroring worked fine: The neural pathways they would use to squeeze the ball themselves fired strongly. But the powerful group\u2019s? Less so.\n\nWas the mirroring response broken? More like anesthetized. None of the participants possessed permanent power. They were college students who had been \u201cprimed\u201d to feel potent by recounting an experience in which they had been in charge. The anesthetic would presumably wear off when the feeling did\u2014their brains weren\u2019t structurally damaged after an afternoon in the lab. But if the effect had been long-lasting\u2014say, by dint of having Wall Street analysts whispering their greatness quarter after quarter, board members offering them extra helpings of pay, and Forbes praising them for \u201cdoing well while doing good\u201d\u2014they may have what in medicine is known as \u201cfunctional\u201d changes to the brain.", "description": "How leaders lose mental capacities\u2014most notably for reading other people\u2014that were essential to their rise", "authors": ["Jerry Useem"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2017/06/DIS_Useem_Biz_power/facebook.jpg?1522775042"}
