She said: \u201cI love Woody. I believe him, and I would work with him any time.\u201d\n\nJohansson\u2019s position is in clear opposition to actors such as Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Greta Gerwig and Colin Firth, all of whom expressed regret at working with Allen after the re-emergence of Farrow\u2019s allegation of sexual abuse against him. Allen has always denied the allegations, which have been investigated twice by authorities and no charges brought. Other actors such as Javier Bardem and Anjelica Huston have proclaimed their support.\n\nJohansson added: \u201cI see Woody whenever I can, and I have had a lot of conversations with him about it. I have been very direct with him, and he\u2019s very direct with me. He maintains his innocence, and I believe him.\u201d\n\nAllen is currently in a legal dispute with Amazon, the backer of his most recently completed film A Rainy Day in New York. Amazon terminated a four-film agreement with him, citing his comments about the #MeToo movement. Johansson, a founding member of the Time\u2019s Up campaign, acknowledged others\u2019 concerns about Allen. \u201cIt\u2019s hard because it\u2019s a time where people are very fired up, and understandably,\u201d she said. \u201cThings needed to be stirred up, and so people have a lot of passion and a lot of strong feelings and are angry, rightfully so. It\u2019s an intense time.\u201d\n\nAllen is currently working on a film in Spain, Rivkin\u2019s Festival, starring Christoph Waltz and Gina Gershon, while A Rainy Day in New York is to be released in a number of international territories after its premiere at the Deauville film festival on 6 September. It is yet to secure distribution in the US or UK.", "description": "Actor says she has spoken extensively to the director about claims of sexual abuse and \u2018would work with him any time\u2019", "authors": ["Andrew Pulver"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e296dab70b5e24bda080ade3ef53fdaed11715c8/791_128_1988_1192/master/1988.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cd6883be2eee1c88b2ad1f3e04a4d195"}
