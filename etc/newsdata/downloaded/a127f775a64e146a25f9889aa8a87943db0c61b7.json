The latter stir \u2014 his homesick wife Coleen was intent on moving the family back to England this summer \u2014 led to the jarring announcement in August that Rooney would leave MLS early and sign with Derby County, a second-flight English club, to become a player and assistant coach, starting this winter.\n\nAD\n\nHe was not here long enough to merit a soulful farewell or leaguewide tributes. United\u2019s failure to beat nine-man Cincinnati in the regular-season finale \u2014 with Rooney sidelined by a yellow-card suspension \u2014 all but ended the possibility of one last Audi Field serenade this postseason.\n\nIf United were to win at Toronto FC on Saturday, it would visit top-seeded New York City FC in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Odds are, Rooney\u2019s MLS tenure will end sooner rather than later. Shortly thereafter, he will dash back to England, reunite with his wife and four children and prepare for the last stage of a spectacular career.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cStill hoping we can change his mind and make him stay,\u201d goalkeeper Bill Hamid said. \u201cHe has come here and done some amazing things.\u201d\n\nBefore he departs, Rooney has one final mission here.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re capable of doing really well in the playoffs,\u201d he said of a fifth-seeded D.C. squad (13-10-11) that did not concede a goal in the final five games of the regular season (3-0-2). \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to be tough. It starts in Toronto. To play at home would have been better, obviously. We are where we are. We have had two weeks to get ready for this game.\u201d\n\nRooney, who will turn 34 next Thursday, has had three weeks to prepare after serving that late suspension, part of a string of absences in recent months: He missed five of the last 12 regular-season matches because of suspensions, injuries, illness and family matters.\n\nAD\n\nNonetheless, he continues to lead United in goals (11) and assists (eight). Since July 1, though, he has scored once.\n\nHis MLS totals remain notable: 23 goals and 15 assists in 48 regular-season appearances (45 starts) since his move from Premier League club Everton in July 2018.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe chapter isn\u2019t closed,\u201d Coach Ben Olsen said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exciting because he has been a big plus for this club.\u201d\n\nBecause the season is not over, Rooney and the team have been reluctant to talk at length about his legacy; there is, after all, a trophy to pursue.\n\nIn an interview this week, Rooney allowed himself to reflect a bit.\n\n\u201cI will miss my teammates. I\u2019ve been great friends with a lot of them,\u201d he said while rubbing gray and red whiskers covering his chin and jaw. \u201cI will miss the banter in the locker room. Playing here has been something I have really enjoyed. Of course, I am going to miss it.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a good chapter in my life, in my career, something I will always remember.\u201d\n\nUnless United makes a playoff run, Rooney will remember last year more than this year. The 2018 surge lifted a lowly team into the playoffs, and Rooney\u2019s attacking partnership with Argentine midfielder Luciano Acosta was a joy to witness.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor me, the highlight was getting into the playoffs last year,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cIt was massive for the club, for the fans, to bring some excitement back to the team.\u201d\n\nThough United was ousted by Columbus in a first-round, penalty-kick tiebreaker, United was back on MLS\u2019s map and in the D.C. sports consciousness.\n\nThis season started with great promise, got sidetracked, then regained its way. The Rooney-Acosta connection, however, fizzled. Two months ago, Acosta lost his starting job.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cConsciously, we didn\u2019t want to concede as many goals as we did last season,\u201d Rooney said in explaining the offensive problems. \u201cSo maybe the way we play is a little bit different. We play a bit deeper and don\u2019t have as much possession.\u201d\n\nUnited conceded the second-fewest goals in MLS (38) and scored the fourth-fewest (42).\n\nAD\n\nWhile Acosta seemed burdened by the disappointment of not moving to Paris Saint-Germain last winter, Rooney encountered off-field headaches.\n\nIn December, after consuming several drinks and a sleeping pill on a flight from Saudi Arabia, he was arrested at Dulles Airport for opening a security door in the terminal. He was charged with public swearing/intoxication and paid a small fine.\n\nAD\n\nOn multiple occasions during the year, British tabloids published photographs of him socializing with women at restaurants and bars. Although Rooney said nothing inappropriate occurred, it did not sit well with his wife. \u201cShe was pissed because he embarrassed her,\u201d said one person, who requested anonymity.\n\nOne set of nightlife photos included French teammate Frederic Brillant, a family man who, upon learning from a Rooney representative he would appear in the tabloids, became upset. The next match, he played his worst game of the season.\n\nAD\n\nDuring the year, Coleen Rooney struggled to assimilate; the couple had spent their entire lives in the Manchester-Liverpool area of northwest England. When she and the kids moved out of the family\u2019s rented house in Bethesda this summer, her husband relocated to a condominium, owned by United management, at the Wharf, the upscale, mixed-used development near Audi Field.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOf course, you miss them,\u201d he said of his family. \u201cIt was the same [when he first arrived last year]. As an athlete, you have to deal with it.\u201d\n\nOlsen and Rooney\u2019s teammates speak highly of him, admiring his work ethic and leadership, experience and friendship. Late this season, he arranged a limousine and suite at a Washington Redskins game for the squad.\n\n\u201cHe has been a good teammate and ambassador for the club,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cHe is a very knowledgeable guy, whether it\u2019s the locker-room dynamics or tactically. Picking his brain and discussing what we are doing internally, there\u2019s always a lot of fruitful dialogue.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThose days are almost over. He carries one lingering regret.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen I first joined here, I wanted to win a trophy,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cObviously, leaving a bit earlier than we all thought, this is my last opportunity. That\u2019s my goal before I go.\"\n\nRead more about soccer:", "description": "A season and a half after his celebrated arrival, international star is headed back overseas whenever D.C.
