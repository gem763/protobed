Making the provision of congressionally mandated American security funding to an ally \u2014 one still being invaded by Russia, in case anyone forgot \u2014 dependent upon that ally\u2019s finding dirt on a political rival is a straight-up abuse of presidential power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLegally, Trump may have been on solid ground in halting the funds if he\u2019d used the procedure laid out by the Impoundment Control Act, which gives Congress 45 days to effectively veto a president\u2019s attempt to stop such an expenditure. But the administration has not used the Impoundment Control Act on a foreign-aid expenditure this year.\n\nPolitically, the calculus is . . . a little different. Very, very few voters who currently support Trump will abandon him, in part because of the sunken-costs theory, but also because they don\u2019t particularly care about U.S. policy toward Ukraine one way or the other, and \u2014 this is really important \u2014 the Bidens\u2019 interactions with Ukraine look pretty shady, even they turn out to have been above-board. A lot of Americans, and not just hardcore Trump supporters, will believe that the moment Hunter Biden, who had never worked in the natural-gas industry before, started making $50,000 per month from a Ukrainian gas company, wealthy foreigners had successfully attempted to buy the Obama administration\u2019s goodwill. They won\u2019t be mad at Trump for wanting Ukraine to look into it, and they won\u2019t be upset at the hardball tactic of suggesting that U.S. aid would be withheld until it did. They\u2019ll scoff at the argument that Biden\u2019s gleeful tale of strong-arming the Ukrainians was just good statesmanship, while Trump\u2019s demand for an investigation represented impeachable corruption. As for the voters most committed to opposing Trump, they would oppose him no matter what.\n\nSo it almost doesn\u2019t matter what the whistleblower complaint included, or what Giuliani says under oath before Congress if he\u2019s asked to testify. The Democratic majority in the House was itching to impeach before the Ukraine allegations, while Republicans were never going to reach the point of concluding that, like Richard Nixon before him, Trump had to resign for the good of the country. There\u2019s no possible revelation that could change impeachment-hungry Democratic legislators\u2019 minds, and there\u2019s no possible revelation that could get their Republican counterparts to believe that it\u2019s worth enraging Trump\u2019s base and joining an impeachment effort.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn short, the battle lines have already been drawn and each side is dug in, convinced that it\u2019s right and it will quickly and decisively win the coming battle. Democrats want to impeach and in fact need to; Republicans want the same fight, convinced it will backfire on Democrats. The Ukraine transcript was just Gavrilo Princip\u2019s shot; the chain reaction of consequences is already underway.
