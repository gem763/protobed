Prep them, bung them in the oven, and serve them hot and bubbling to widespread fanfare. Then freeze the leftovers for a rainy day. Easy.\n\nBut which casserole dish is the best? Does the ubiquitous \u2013 and undeniably handsome \u2013 Le Creuset reign supreme in terms of quality and durability?\n\nIt's an important question because, when it comes to casserole pots, the best will last for (almost) ever. Buy wisely and you should have your dish for life.\n\nOne of the useful things I've found while testing and reviewing casserole dishes is that the market is actually much more straightforward than it seems. People ask online whether they should be looking at casserole dishes, Dutch ovens, cocottes, coquelles \u2013 but as Justin Kowbel, co-founder of Borough Kitchen cookware shop, tells me, they\u2019re all basically the same thing.\n\nThe only confusion can be around stock pots, which are taller and nearly always stainless steel, copper or multi-ply. You can make a casserole in these (if you can fit them in your oven), but they're not as efficient in terms of retaining heat when compared with traditional casserole pots. They also often have thinner bases, which can lead to stews burning.", "description": "Beef bourguignon, coq au vin, Lancashire hot pot, Hungarian goulash, vegan chilli, or \u2013 my personal favourite \u2013 sausage stew:", "authors": ["Madeleine Howell"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/recommended/2018/12/14/The-best_Casserole-dishes-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2018-12-14"}
