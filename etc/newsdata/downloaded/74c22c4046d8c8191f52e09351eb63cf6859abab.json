This person should be here because maybe he could learn something.\u201d\n\nHe then identified Johnson by name and cited his remarks about \u201cvalues.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very insulting statement after all I\u2019ve done for the police,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ve done more than any other president has done for the police.\u201d\n\nClaiming that Chicago\u2019s violence is \u201cembarrassing to us as a nation,\u201d Trump took aim at Johnson in remarkably personal terms, saying Chicago\u2019s police \u201care entitled to a police superintendent who has their backs and knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nTrump rattled off several statistics about crime in Chicago, the nation\u2019s third-largest city, which had 561 homicides last year, according to police.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAfghanistan is a safe place by comparison,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAD\n\nHe also accused Johnson of valuing illegal immigrants and criminals more than law-abiding citizens.\n\n\u201cAnd frankly those values to me are a disgrace,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI want Eddie Johnson to change his values and to change them fast.\u201d\n\nIn a news conference after Trump\u2019s remarks, Johnson said that \u201cfacts matter,\u201d highlighting the city\u2019s efforts to reduce violence and homicides in recent years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had double-digit reductions in crime for the last three years,\u201d Johnson said, adding that he disputed what he described as \u201cthe national narrative that Chicago is a city on fire.\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s violence has drawn national attention and concern in recent years as it rose in 2016 to levels Chicago had not seen in two decades, though it has declined since that point. Since 2016 \u2014 when Chicago had more homicides than New York and Los Angeles combined \u2014 the number of homicides and shootings have both fallen.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to statistics tracked by the Chicago Tribune, 436 people were killed in the city through Saturday, 46 fewer than a year earlier. More than 2,310 people were shot as of Sunday, according to the Tribune\u2019s database, down 223 from a year earlier.\n\nChicago, in particular, has been a recurring feature of Trump\u2019s remarks and Twitter feed. When discussing Chicago\u2019s crime, Trump has compared the city to Afghanistan on previous occasions. He has likened the city to \u201ca war zone\u201d and said, without elaboration, that the violence is \u201cvery easily fixable.\u201d Trump has suggested that the problem is due to Chicago officials \u201cbeing overly politically correct.\u201d Trump has also suggested in the past, as he did Monday, that the federal government could step in and help Chicago. Federal officials are already on the ground in Chicago, with different task forces involving collaboration between local police and federal agencies.\n\nAfter his remarks to the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Trump held a closed-door luncheon fundraiser at his name-branded high-rise hotel in downtown Chicago \u2014 where revenue has dropped since Trump\u2019s political career took off, internal documents have shown.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign and a Republican Party official said the event for 250 people would raise $4 million for the Trump Victory joint fundraising committee.\n\nWhile Trump attended the fundraiser, protesters marched along a promenade across the Chicago River. Several demonstrators held signs, including one that read, \u201cAll Roads Lead to Putin\u201d and another reading, \u201cDo Us a Favor, Though\u201d \u2014 a reference to Trump\u2019s now-famous utterance to the president of Ukraine during a phone call in which he pressed for an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nMargaret Mitchell, who teaches at the University of Chicago, said she was attending the protest \u201cbecause I think we are in a really critical time in this country.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople need to wake up about the true erosion of our institutions and our civil life,\u201d she said. President Barack Obama, who was long based in Chicago before winning the White House, \u201chad exceptional intelligence and respect for all persons,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cObama was the president for all Americans. Trump is the exact opposite.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDuring his speech to the police chiefs Monday, Trump repeated a variation of a story he\u2019s told in the past, claiming that he spoke to \u201ca really powerful, strong-looking\u201d officer in the city years earlier who had told him police could fix the city\u2019s violence \u201cin one day, sir.\u201d\n\nTrump has told different versions of the tale before.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2016, during the presidential campaign, Trump said on Fox News that \u201ca top police officer in Chicago\u201d had told him he could stop the violence \u201cin one week.\u201d\n\nPolice officials said at the time that \u201cno one in the senior command\u201d met with Trump or his campaign. A few months after taking office in 2017, Trump told a story about meeting \u201ca really respected officer\u201d in Chicago who told him they could stop the violence in \u201ca couple of days.\u201d Later that year, Trump told a similar story and said the officer told him they could \u201cstop it immediately.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAsked about this on Monday, Johnson said the police department searched extensively for whoever this officer might be but \u201cwe were never able to identify him.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time trying to identify this person,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBecause if there\u2019s somebody that can stop crime in a day, then I would bow down to them and say bring it on.\u201d\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t going to happen, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all adults here,\u201d Johnson said at a news conference. \u201cIf there were that person, they would solve the crime in this country, not just in Chicago. So that person doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments about Chicago have repeatedly prompted pushback from Johnson, a veteran of the Chicago police who ascended to the top job in 2016.\n\nAfter Trump claimed during the presidential election that year that a \u201ctop police officer\u201d had told him the violence could be stopped in a week, Johnson replied by saying: \u201cIf you have a magic bullet to stop the violence anywhere, not just in Chicago but in America, then please, share it with us.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen Trump threatened in a tweet to \u201csend in the Feds!,\u201d Johnson responded by saying he had \u201cno idea what he\u2019s talking about.\u201d\n\nDuring his news conference Monday, Johnson also said that \u201cafter today, I\u2019m not going to even comment on this anymore, because we have bigger challenges in this city than going back and forth.\u201d\n\nWagner and Berman reported from Washington.
