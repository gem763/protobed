The statute of limitations was three years.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s victory is a complete vindication,\u201d Seinfeld\u2019s lawyer, Orin Snyder, said in a statement. \u201cJerry created \u2018Comedians in Cars\u2019 and this lawsuit was nothing but a money-grab seeking to capitalize on the success of the show. We are pleased that the court saw through the noise.\u201d\n\nCharles, who said he had worked with Seinfeld since 1994, said he mentioned the idea to Seinfeld for \u201cComedians in Cars\u201d as early as 2002, when pitching a project called \u201cTwo Stupid Guys in a Stupid Car Driving to a Stupid Town.\u201d\n\nHe said he reminded Seinfeld of that pitch when the comedian in 2011 said he was mulling an idea that became \u201cComedians in Cars.\u201d\n\nTheir relationship allegedly broke down after the pilot, which Charles directed, was shot in October 2011, and Charles sought more credit and compensation than Seinfeld wanted to give.\n\nNetflix and Sony Pictures Television are among the other defendants. \u201cComedians in Cars\u201d began broadcasting on Crackle, and moved to Netflix last year.\n\n\u201cWe are, of course, disappointed,\u201d Peter Skolnik, a lawyer for Charles, said in an email where he also faulted Seinfeld\u2019s alleged \u201cegregious, shabby conduct.\u201d Skolnik said he would speak with Charles to discuss their next steps.\n\nSeinfeld had argued that Charles sued only after having \u201clearned\u201d that \u201cComedians in Cars\u201d had become a hit, and that Netflix was paying $750,000 an episode.\n\nNathan, however, said it mattered more that Charles had been aware in 2012 that the show, which does not credit him, was being made.\n\n\u201cCharles believed that \u2018Seinfeld would eventually acknowledge Charles\u2019 authorship and ownership and bring him in,\u2019\u201d Nathan wrote, quoting from the complaint. \u201cBecause Charles was on notice that his ownership claim had been repudiated since at least 2012, his infringement claim is time-barred.\u201d", "description": "\u201cToday\u2019s victory is a complete vindication.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d93058f210000310050f2aa.jpeg?cache=eiqpj3qlrz&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
