Kurdish officials have said almost 800 people fled that camp after the Turkish offensive into northern Syria targeted the area.\n\nLe Drian said women, who had joined Islamic State, should also face justice in the region, although Paris would look to bring back children.\n\n\"The French women who went to this region in 2015 knew what they were doing. They aren't tourists. They are fighters against France and must face trial (in Iraq) if possible,\" he said.
