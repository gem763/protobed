Asked if Evans is a man of color, he avoided the question. What about Michael Jordan? \u201cI\u2019ve never met him,\u201d Ryan said. Former president Barack Obama? Same thing.\n\nEvan\u2019s case \u2014 and Ryan\u2019s startling deposition \u2014 have sparked outrage this week in the craft brewing world, a notoriously white industry with long-standing diversity issues. Evans said his case also shows how white managers like Ryan might \u201chave utter disregard for people of color and the things that we go through.\u201d\n\nEvans was hired six years ago as a packing machine operator at Founder\u2019s Grand Rapids facility, he said in a lawsuit, filed in August 2018 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. Since its opening over two decades ago, Founders, the largest brewery in Michigan, has made a name for itself among craft beer lovers for its breakfast stouts, which are brewed with coffee and chocolate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut as one of just three minority employees in a staff of 70 at Founders, he said he soon found the company turned \u201ca blind eye to racism\u201d and allowed \u201can overtly racist culture.\"\n\nInside the brewery, an airy, two-story brick building in downtown Grand Rapids, the printer meant for management was named the \u201cwhite guy printer,\u201d while the \u201cblack guy printer\u201d was located downstairs for lower-rung staffers, he alleged. One staffer used a racial slur to his face, Evans said.\n\nNearly a year into his employment, Evans said, he was passed over for a promotion in favor of two more recently hired employees, both of whom were white. Evans had trained both of them, but it was their behavior at a company party that was especially alarming: One had drunkenly crashed his car into another vehicle, while the other employee had allegedly exposed himself to the crowd.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen Founders opened a taproom in Detroit in 2017, Evans saw it as a chance for a fresh start. He received a promotion to manage promotions and events for the new branch, the first time his company had expanded outside Grand Rapids.\n\nBut the Detroit taproom didn\u2019t prove to be much better, he claimed. One co-worker, noticing that the brewery was starting to attract more African American customers, made a comment about the establishment\u2019s \u201cdark\u201d clientele. Later, he called one of Detroit\u2019s former black mayors, Kwame Kilpatrick, the \u201chead [n-word] in charge.\u201d\n\nDespite complaints from Evans and some co-workers, that employee wasn\u2019t disciplined beyond a single write-up.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThese racist things went on and he went to HR immediately,\u201d said Jack Schulz, Evans\u2019s lawyer, \u201cand basically from that point forward, their views on him soured.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFrustrated by the situation, he took a personal day to drive back to Grand Rapids and meet with the human resources officers in person. But when he returned to work the following week in late 2017, he was fired almost immediately, with his bosses citing missed deadlines on a project.\n\nSo he sued, alleging he was discriminated against on the basis of his race. In preparation for a possible jury trial, Schulz deposed three Founders managers, including Ryan, on Sept. 25 of this year. That\u2019s when Ryan denied to confirm that his former employee is black.\n\nAD\n\nThe brewery acknowledged that Evans is black in court documents, but Ryan would not admit to a similar claim.\n\n\u201cAre you aware Tracy is African-American?\u201d Schulz asked, according to the deposition.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure of his lineage,\u201d Ryan said, \u201cso I can\u2019t answer that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSchulz suspects the move is tactical: To argue on whether Founders discriminated against Evans as a minority, his managers must first acknowledge that he is one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a corporate, calculated dialogue that he won\u2019t even admit that he knows whether Michael Jordan is black, or Barack Obama is black,\u201d Schulz said in an interview with The Post. \u201cThe cost is the loss of all credibility.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSchulz said that he didn\u2019t buy Ryan\u2019s \u201cdefense of colorblindness,\u201d noting that the two men had known each other even before they started working together.\n\n\u201cObviously, there\u2019s a broad spectrum in terms of race. But this is a man you\u2019ve known for seven years,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know that he\u2019s a black guy, then what have you been doing for seven years? \u2026 Especially knowing and representing Tracy, who openly talks about how race affects his life, it\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Founders argued that Ryan\u2019s deposition has been taken out of context.\n\n\u201cMr. Ryan was simply saying that he does not assume anything about individuals\u2019 race or ethnicity unless they tell him that information,\u201d the company said. \u201cWhile it might be acceptable to speculate about this type of thing in casual conversation, Mr. Ryan was not having a casual conversation. He was under oath when he made these statements.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nReached by phone late Monday night, Patrick Edsenga, the brewery\u2019s lawyer, declined to comment further.\n\nEvans has been focused on raising awareness of discrimination and harassment in the service industry, organizing workshops, bringing in lawyers to offer training, and connecting others with counseling focused on support.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this blind ignorance, and to me that\u2019s the larger story,\u201d he told the Metro Times. \u201cA lot of these white-owned companies \u2014 and it\u2019s not just Detroit, it\u2019s all over the country \u2014 come in and have this sort of blindness to overt racism, and it has to be called out.\n\n\u201cHow can one expect to know what minorities go through,\u201d he said, \u201cif they can\u2019t even acknowledge that [some employees are] minorities?\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Tracy Evans claims he was fired from his job at Founders Brewing Co. after he complained about its \"racist corporate culture.\"", "authors": ["Teo Armus", "Reporter On The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/oHlMUpd27A9YyUt8nmiWCrCpLN4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2MN7LHFMPZEPZM6LBWSNGUEL2M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
