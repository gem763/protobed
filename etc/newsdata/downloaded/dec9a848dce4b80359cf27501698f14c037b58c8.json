Through Dec. 6 last season, the average game length had ticked up more than two minutes, according to Forbes.\n\nSo it\u2019s a conundrum: In its attempt to make its product as entertaining as possible, the NBA has instituted rules that both decrease and increase the length of its games. This season it has a new idea, one that will get a tryout in the G League for the 2019-20 season: An experimental free throw rule in which players will shoot only one foul shot, with the value of that made free throw dependent on the type of foul that was committed (one point for a non-shooting foul, two for a foul on a regular field goal, three for fouling a three-point attempt).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe new rule won\u2019t apply to end-of-game situations: Traditional free throw rules will apply to the final two minutes of regulation and overtime to prevent trailing teams from intentionally fouling even earlier. But Brad Walker, head of basketball operations for the G League, told ESPN\u2019s Zach Lowe that the new free throw concept could shave six to eight minutes off the length of a game.\n\nG League games already run shorter than NBA games, about 2:05, thanks to a number of experimental rules that include shorter shot clock resets on advances, shorter overtime periods and reset timeouts, which allow teams to advance the ball up the court and make substitutions but not huddle in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter and in overtime. It also used a coach\u2019s challenge the past two seasons, an idea that will be implemented on a trial basis in the NBA starting in 2019-20.\n\nThat seems likely to add some time to NBA games, further erasing the time savings gained by the freedom-of-movement rules in the 2017-18 season and adding to the league\u2019s conundrum.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLowe notes that there are some worries about the rule with regards to historic standards, a notion Warriors superstar Stephen Curry seemed to bring up in a tweet Thursday that referenced his 2015-16 season, when he shot 50.4 percent overall, 45.4 percent from three-point range, and 90.8 percent from the free throw line.\n\nThey might have to change the 50/40/90 accomplishment \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. \u2014 Stephen Curry (@StephenCurry30) September 26, 2019\n\nThe worry with this rule change is that, with only one free throw, it will drive down everyone\u2019s free throw percentage. Over the past 20 seasons, ESPN notes, NBA players have historically shot the worst on their first free throw attempt: 73.3 percent. That improves to 78 percent on the second and 85.7 percent on the third.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nSign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox\n\nNBA players won\u2019t be able to lie about their height anymore\n\nAdam Silver on NBA\u2019s stricter tampering rules: Fans \u2018were losing confidence in our system\u2019\n\nNBA fines Bucks for tampering with Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is on the Bucks\n\nAn ode to the NBA\u2019s \u2018ninja-style\u2019 headbands: Gone but not forgotten\n\nDoc Rivers talks Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and how the Clippers pulled off deal of the decade\n\nAD", "description": "Officials say it could shave five minutes off the length of a contest.", "authors": ["Matt Bonesteel", "Reporter For The Early Lead"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/c8pObAx26iD-75ZP8Sr8BhAeoig=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T5G4UBSWEYI6PBALKEQCMMM5U4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
