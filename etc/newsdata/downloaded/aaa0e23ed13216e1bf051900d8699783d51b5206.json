At the very least Neil Woodford should be censured and fined for running investment portfolios that broke fund rules.\n\nHe should also be banned from ever working again in financial services. Harsh but right, CBE or no CBE. Experts also believe Woodford could face class actions from investors who invested in Equity Income not knowing the fund was breaking rules (see point 5).\n\n'Untenable': Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority\n\n2. Hargreaves Lansdown must also be hauled over the coals and fined by the regulator for continuing to recommend Equity Income even when it knew the fund's risk profile was changing for the worse.\n\nIt knew about this deterioration as early as late 2017, raised it with Woodford, but did not think to alert investors (existing or new) so that they could decide whether the extra risk was one they were prepared to accept.\n\nExperts believe Hargreaves Lansdown's failure to warn customers now leaves it open to a possible class legal action from aggrieved investors.\n\n3. The regulator also needs to ensure all best buy lists assembled by fund platforms such as Hargreaves Lansdown are now 100 per cent robust and not corrupted by commercial interests.\n\nHargreaves Lansdown included Woodford Equity Income on its best buy list because it was in the best interests of both itself (more funds under management, more fees, more profits) and Woodford (more money to manage, more revenues and profits for the directors).\n\nThese lists should now comprise all types of investment vehicle \u2013 not just funds. They should include active portfolios (run by managers) and passive or index tracking funds (run by computers). Any platform abusing best buy lists should be fined.\n\nRobin Powell, an investment campaigner, says platforms should be 'transparent about their selection process and held accountable by the regulator'.\n\nWhy did no one spot this? Analysis of the 2015 accounts for Woodford Equity Income by Alan Miller of wealth manager SCM Direct shows that 36 per cent of the fund (at the end of 2015) was invested in securities that 'did not have a quoted price in an active market'. Miller's question to the regulator and Hargreaves Lansdown executives is simple: 'Did you read these accounts?' If they had, he claims, they should not have allowed investors to buy without signing a document confirming they understood the risks.\n\n4. Link and Northern Trust were the overseers of Woodford Equity Income. Between them, they failed to protect the interests of investors as was their duty. They should be fined by the Financial Conduct Authority.\n\n5. Equity Income's downfall was investing in unquoted or illiquid stocks that could not then be sold quickly enough when investors wanted out of the fund.\n\nWith no cash available to meet redemption requests, fund dealings had to be suspended. It is now blatantly obvious that open-ended funds \u2013 the likes of Equity Income and Income Focus \u2013 are unsuitable for the holding of big positions in unquoted and illiquid stocks including many listed on the AIM stock market.\n\nOpen-ended property funds shut their doors in 2016 because of liquidity issues, so it's not a new problem.\n\nThe regulator has been looking to tighten up the rules, but that's not good enough. It needs to act now.\n\nAlan Miller believes 'retail investors should not be allowed to invest in funds with unquoted holdings unless they have signed a waiver stating they have been made aware of the risk and are happy to proceed'.\n\n6. The regulator should not allow any investment fund to pose as an equity income fund unless its overriding objective is to deliver investors a stream of dividend income. Woodford Equity Income was never an income fund and should have been labelled from the start Woodford UK Equity or Woodford UK Equity and Unquoted. Indeed, no fund should have a misleading label.\n\n7. The regulator should look at putting limits on how much of a company a fund manager can own as well as limits on the amount a fund can hold in an individual stock.\n\n8. Finally, the head of Andrew Bailey \u2013 chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 should roll.\n\nSays Miller: 'His position is untenable. On Woodford, the regulator is guilty of supervisory failure.'\n\nPhil Case, an investment consultant, says: 'Under Bailey's watch, the regulator seemed to be asleep at the wheel. It is keen to fine other businesses but the biggest failure here is the FCA. Those who are guilty should all be sacked.'\n\nOther funds are still worth a look Do your homework: Unlike income-orientated funds, stock market listed investment trusts have the ability to squirrel away some of the income they receive from holdings Neil Woodford has given equity income a bad name, but there are still some outstanding investment funds and investment trusts available that strive to deliver an attractive income. When Woodford Equity Income was launched in 2014, Brian Dennehy, of FundExpert, shunned it \u2013 preferring instead to point investors in the direction of alternatives such as Schroder Income and JO Hambro Capital Management (JOHCM) UK Equity Income. Both have proved superior \u2013 in terms of growing investors' income and capital. Today, he says there are four UK equity income funds that have grown their income in at least nine of the past ten years. 'Dividend growth is the vital issue for most income investors,' says Dennehy. They are BlackRock UK Income, Trojan Income, JOHCM UK Equity Income and Jupiter Responsible Income \u2013 and have respective annual dividend yields of 3.9, 4, 4.7 and 4 per cent. Unlike income-orientated funds, stock market listed investment trusts have the ability to squirrel away some of the income they receive from holdings so it can be paid out to shareholders when dividend payments are generally under pressure \u2013 maybe because of a difficult economic backdrop. This smoothing process has allowed many UK equity income trusts to grow their dividends going back more than 30 years. They include City of London (managed by Janus Henderson), JP Morgan Claverhouse, Murray Income (Aberdeen Standard) and Merchants (Allianz).\n\nDo you believe Neil Woodford should be required to return the \u00a38.7 million of fees he took from Equity Income while it was suspended?\n\nIf you are a Woodford Equity Income investor would you support a 'class action' lawsuit against him for breaking rules on exposure to unquoted companies?\n\nAnd if you bought the fund via Hargreaves Lansdown from late 2017 onwards, would you support a class action on the grounds that you were not given information that Hargreaves Lansdown had about the fund's exposure?\n\nLet us know your views.
