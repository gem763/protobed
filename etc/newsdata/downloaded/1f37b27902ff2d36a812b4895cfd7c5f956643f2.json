(Chris Keane/Reuters )\n\nChelsea Clinton declares on The View that she\u2019s not considering running for Congress.\n\nThroughout the run-up to the 2016 election, I was a pretty dyspeptic critic of Chelsea Clinton \u2014 from her $1,083-per-minute speaking gig at a university, to her selection to give the keynote address at SXSW, to her awards for \u201cWoman of the Year\u201d and \u201cMom of the Year,\u201d to her insufferable declaration that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t care about money on a fundamental level\u201d . . . and perhaps most of all, the endless puff pieces that kept trying to convince us that she was someone fascinating and surprising and a natural leader, and that she would still be getting this same attention and praise and opportunities if she didn\u2019t come from a famous family. Nor did I have any patience for those pieces immediately after the 2016 election that seemed to pitch her as the next great Democratic hope.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s worth noting that since 2018 or so, Chelsea Clinton has shown a recurring willingness to call out figures on the Left who are beyond the pale, from Louis Farrakhan comparing Jews to Termites to public attacks on Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s daughters and Barron Trump. The willingness to criticize ideological allies has been in short supply in recent years.\n\nIf Chelsea Clinton ran for this open House seat in New York, she would begin with an instant name-recognition and fundraising advantage in the primary, and she would probably win in the Democratic-leaning district. But from all appearances, she has no deep yearning to run for office or serve in elected office anytime soon. She\u2019s carved out a happy life for herself and her family, far from the realm of politics and this seems . . . wise. Level-headed. A refreshing respite from the sense of entitlement that so many famous children seem to exhibit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve urged Americans to take a break from the Kennedys for the sake of everyone (including the Kennedys), and while the younger members of the Bush family seem like nice people, the country is not yearning for the restoration of any dynasties. American politics is not supposed to be an endless war among the same half-dozen rival families, like some less violent version of Game of Thrones.", "description": "Chelsea Clinton declares on 'The View' that she\u2019s not considering running for Congress.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
