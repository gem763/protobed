General Assembly and holding a conference with 30 other nations and 20 nonprofit organizations calling on the intergovernmental organization to conduct an investigation into the crackdown.\n\nThe U.S. moves against China also came days before the two countries were scheduled to return to the negotiating table on Thursday.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday announced visa restrictions on Chinese officials accused of being involved in the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
