(AP) - Even the managers were perplexed by all the quirky details of a game that began nearly four months ago and finished in a different ballpark way out West.\n\nChad Pinder homered, Mike Fiers earned his fourth victory or his 14th, however you want to look at it, and the Oakland Athletics beat the Detroit Tigers 7-3 on Friday night in a game that was suspended on May 19 because of the weather.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of oddities,\u201d A\u2019s manager Bob Melvin said.\n\nFiers (14-3) is unbeaten over 21 starts dating to his no-hitter May 7. He allowed three runs and four hits over six innings.\n\nOakland reliever Jake Diekman will have two appearances on May 19 with two different clubs: He actually pitched one inning for the Royals in Anaheim on May 19, and then got into the game Friday with Oakland with the stats credited for May 19.\n\nIt took 39 minutes to finish the 2-hour, 58-minute game more than half a country away. Not many fans made it early on a Friday.\n\n\u201cIt almost felt like a Legion game because when we went out there there was nobody there,\u201d Melvin said.\n\nThe victory gave the A\u2019s their first 11-game winning streak since winning 20 straight in 2002 and the longest in the majors this season. If the A\u2019s hadn\u2019t been able to hold on, it would have counted as a seven-game winning streak. Oakland also will be credited for an eight-game road winning streak from May 16-June 4.\n\nPinder connected for a two-run drive - the A\u2019s hadn\u2019t cleared the fences yet on May 19 - to give Oakland a streak of 17 straight games with a homer, matching the sixth-longest such streak in A\u2019s history. Pinder technically homered in his third straight game, from May 17-19 against the Tigers.\n\nStephen Piscotty had three hits, not playing at all Friday as he\u2019s on the injured list.\n\nAnd in another strange twist, September call-ups were eligible but their stats go back to May when they were still in the minors - while not changing the day of their major league debuts.\n\nThere was no national anthem because that took place May 19 in Detroit.\n\nMelvin called Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire ahead of time to discuss details of the game since neither had been part of this exact situation before - and they also met with the umpires for guidance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unprecedented, but it is different,\u201d Gardenhire said.\n\nYes, it sure was. While Liam Hendriks struck out Jordy Mercer leading off the bottom of the seventh, the K will actually go to Josh Harrison considering he was supposed to be batting but got released by the Tigers last month.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen very often,\u201d Melvin said. \u201cI would prefer it doesn\u2019t happen again at some point.\u201d\n\nDetroit wore its road uniforms for both games. Yet the A\u2019s made the Tigers feel plenty welcome for this wacky start - well, finish - to a weekend series.\n\nThe in-park electronic ribbon logos below the second deck read \u201cWELCOME TO COMERICA PARK!\u201d with THE COLISEUM crossed out in yellow. Detroit\u2019s logo was the main one on the scoreboard, too, with another Welcome to Comerica Park greeting.\n\nTHE JOY OF JACKSON\n\nThe A\u2019s were thrilled to see right-hander Edwin Jackson again now that he\u2019s on the Tigers. The well-traveled Jackson went 6-3 over 17 starts for Oakland last season as the club reached the playoffs for the first time since 2014.\n\nJackson has kept in touch with Melvin.\n\n\u201cHe did so much for this team. It\u2019s always great to see him. He\u2019s about as infectious a guy as you\u2019ll ever see in a clubhouse,\u201d Melvin said. \u201cJust love the guy.\u201d\n\nHearing of Melvin\u2019s kind words, Jackson grinned and said, \u201cI\u2019m blessed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI miss the boys,\u201d he added.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nAthletics: CF Ramon Laureano returned from the injured list after being sidelined since with a stress reaction in his right leg but started the later game. \u2026 RHP Yusmeiro Petit was in Venezuela following the death of his father and Melvin said there were travel complications that made it unclear when the versatile reliever might return, though it could be as soon as Saturday. \u2026 Piscotty (sprained right ankle) will soon be out of a walking boot but the A\u2019s might need to get creative with his rehab at-bats given the minor league seasons ending. \u201cI\u2019m just glad he\u2019s progressing in the right direction,\u201d Melvin said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRight-hander Spencer Turnbull (3-14, 4.45 ERA) was set to pitch the regularly scheduled game opposite righty Homer Bailey (12-8, 4.96 ERA), who takes a three-game winning streak into Friday\u2019s start against Detroit. Bailey is unbeaten in nine starts against teams from the AL Central.\n\nFor Saturday\u2019s middle game of the series, Tigers right-hander Jordan Zimmermann (1-9, 6.03 ERA) tries for his first win in six starts since July 29. Oakland\u2019s Chris Bassitt (9-5, 3.67 ERA) pitches two days after his scheduled turn after being away earlier in the week for the birth of his daughter.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Even the managers were perplexed by all the quirky details of a game that began nearly four months ago and finished in a different ballpark way out West.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Janie Mccauley"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/tigers_athletics_baseball_82375_c0-221-5275-3296_s1770x1032.jpg?d6203926e2c607ac72a547ec1e232dcda32639d6", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
