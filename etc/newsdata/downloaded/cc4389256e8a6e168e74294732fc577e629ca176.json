He last slept in it six-and-a-half weeks ago, the night before he was killed in a head-on collision with the vehicle of American diplomat\u2019s wife Anne Sacoolas who was allegedly driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\n\u2018That broke me, really broke me,\u2019 says Charlotte. \u2018It was the first time in six weeks I\u2019ve really cried \u2014 really, really cried. There have been little breakdowns but we\u2019ve all had to try to be stoic for Niall.\u2019\n\nNiall is Harry\u2019s non-identical twin. He is devastated by his brother\u2019s death, so much so that Thursday was the first time he left the family home since he last saw Harry less than an hour before the fatal crash.\n\nThe boys were brought up by Charlotte and their father Tim, and step-parents Bruce and Tracey, to be \u2018honest as the day is long, own up if they\u2019d done something wrong\u2019 and \u2018take responsibility for their actions\u2019.\n\nBoth Bruce and Tracey have two grown-up children from earlier relationships, and all the children see each other as brothers and sisters, says Charlotte. Their step-parents, too, are \u2018more like a second set of parents than steps\u2019.\n\nHarry as a teenager\n\nNiall, who has understandably been hit hardest, cannot make sense of how Mrs Sacoolas can claim diplomatic immunity, leave the country and not face justice for his much-loved brother\u2019s death. Few people can.\n\nThis week the family appealed to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to intervene. He told them the U.S. government had refused two requests to waive Mrs Sacoolas\u2019 immunity. Now they believe the only way to ensure their son\u2019s death is not \u2018swept under the carpet\u2019 is to reveal the full detail of his horrific death.\n\nIn America: Anne Sacoolas\n\nThe family\u2019s only hope now is that the court of public opinion will bring pressure to bear on President Trump.\n\n\u2018This is an abuse of diplomatic immunity,\u2019 says Charlotte. \u2018When the laws were drawn up in the Sixties they weren\u2019t intended to protect a diplomat\u2019s wife who had, albeit unintentionally, killed a 19-year-old boy in an accident. No one else should ever have to suffer as we are \u2014 as Harry did.\n\n\u2018It still feels unreal. But when you wake up in the morning, if you manage to get any rest at all, and that gnawing grief feeling in the pit of your tummy hits you, you know it is.\n\n\u2018The weather that day was lovely \u2014 about 25 degrees \u2014 so Harry (a keen motorbike enthusiast) wanted to go for a ride to see his brother who\u2019d moved out of our house in April and his dad.\n\n\u2018I drove past him on my way home from work at 7.10pm. He nodded to me. I put up my hand and thought I\u2019d see him in a couple of hours.\n\n\u2018Well I did, but he wasn\u2019t alive the next time I got to . . . \u2019\n\nBruce takes Charlotte\u2019s hand as Tracey strokes Tim\u2019s arm. For several minutes, the hotel room where we meet is filled with an impossibly sad silence until Charlotte wipes the tears from her cheeks to muster a watery smile.\n\n\u2018The boys were really close,\u2019 she says. \u2018As youngsters they were inseparable and always up to mischief.\u2019 She reminisces about the time, when they were 18 months old, she caught them trying to break out of the play pen \u2014 Niall on all fours and Harry climbing onto his back. While there were no girlfriends to report, Harry had told his mum that \u2018it wasn\u2019t quiet in the girl department\u2019.\n\nDevoted brothers: Harry, right, and Niall, aged three\n\nNiall, who works as a steel fabricator, moved back in with his mum after they lost Harry. \u2018Bless his heart, he\u2019s said it really upsets him to see us upset so we\u2019ve had to be strong for him.\u2019\n\nShe adds: Thursday was the first day he went out of the house because it was his great-grandfather\u2019s \u2014 Tim\u2019s grandad\u2019s \u2014 funeral. That\u2019s why I chose Thursday to remove Harry\u2019s sheets from his bed. He\u2019d only slept on them once . . .\u2019\n\nCharlotte, 44, works in a GP\u2019s surgery, while her husband Bruce, 55, is a construction site manager. The twins\u2019 father Tim, 50, is a maintenance manager at a boarding school, while his wife Tracey, 52, works for the NHS in clinical coding. They are a close-knit, deeply caring family who have only ever sought to put their children first.\n\nTheir grief is raw and painful to see \u2014 as is their \u2018sense of injustice\u2019 and \u2018bewilderment\u2019.\n\nThe nation \u2014 indeed the world \u2014 has been shocked since news of Harry\u2019s death broke last weekend. He was killed near RAF Croughton, a U.S. intelligence hub, in Northamptonshire on August 27. It is said that Mrs Sacoolas was driving on the wrong side of the road when the collision happened.\n\nSix days after Harry\u2019s death when officers from Northampton told them they intended to charge Mrs Sacoolas with death by dangerous driving \u2014 for which, if found guilty, she would face a custodial sentence \u2014 they asked the charge to be reduced to death by careless driving.\n\n\u2018They told us two of her children were in the car with her,\u2019 says Charlotte. \u2018That broke us. We were really upset for them. How on earth must those children be feeling? They must be extremely traumatised. That was shocking.\n\nGrieving: Left to right, Tim, Tracey, Bruce and Charlotte\n\n\u2018We were very honest with the police and said, although we obviously wanted justice for our son, as parents ourselves, we wanted to work with the police and courts to get the charge reduced and push for a suspended sentence so she could carry on being a mum.\n\n\u2018Now looking back we actually curse ourselves for being so understanding.\u2019\n\nCharlotte cries. \u2018We\u2019re six weeks on and we\u2019ve had nothing. It\u2019s like Harry\u2019s worth nothing. They\u2019ve swept him under the carpet.\u2019\n\nThis family is fighting in every way they can to seek justice for Harry, putting pressure upon the U.S. government to waive the diplomatic immunity that protects Mrs Sacoolas from prosecution.\n\nThey have done so with the sort of measured dignity that says much about the people they are. When Charlotte sat beside her son\u2019s terribly broken body at Oxford\u2019s John Radcliffe Hospital six-and-a-half weeks ago she made him a promise. \u2018We\u2019d asked if we could do organ donation,\u2019 she says. \u2018They just looked at us and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s nothing to donate.\u201d There wasn\u2019t anything much that wasn\u2019t broken either inside or out.\n\n\u2018We were only left with tissue donation. I believe that\u2019s the retinas of his eyes and the skin that wasn\u2019t touched.\u2019\n\nShe adds: \u2018We each had a few minutes with him. I promised him we would all still look after each other. I said that we\u2019d find a way of continuing to live our lives although it would be very different. And I promised him justice would be done. Driving away from the hospital was\u2026\u2019\n\nShe shakes her head. \u2018I didn\u2019t want to leave him. I didn\u2019t want to go home. I felt I was letting him down by leaving him there.\u2019\n\nNext week, they will travel to the States in the hope of pleading their case with President Trump who said, three days ago, they are \u2018trying to work something out\u2019.\n\nThey will also appear on U.S. television to garner public support, which is already wholly sympathetic to this family. \u2018We\u2019ve had thousands of messages of support from America,\u2019 says Tim. \u2018There\u2019s just disbelief this is happening. I am hopeful. For the President of the United States to actually mention our son and say he is looking into it brings me hope. It means Harry is on his radar.\n\nCharlotte\u2019s face is full of sorrow when she looks at Tim from whom she separated when the twins were 13 months old.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve heard nothing from Mrs Sacoolas. I want her side of the story, particularly for Tim\u2019s sake. He had the horrific experience of being with Harry at the scene of the accident.\u2019\n\nTim was at his home little more than three miles away when a friend from the fire brigade, recognising Harry, called to tell him his son had been in an accident.\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be the worst thing ever,\u2019 he says. \u2018I thought, \u201csilly b****r\u2019s hurt himself.\u201d Then when I got there, there was a police cordon so I had to park a couple of hundred yards away. I walked up to a policeman and said, \u201cI\u2019m his dad.\u201d He said, \u201call right, they\u2019re just doing something to him.\u201d The paramedics were working on him. They had put him on a stretcher and had torn off all his clothes. I could see his body.\n\nTim stares at the wall as he speaks. His anguish is written over his face and those around him shed silent tears. This is the first time he has spoken about that dreadful evening.\n\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t get close enough to hold his hand. There were too many people working on him.\n\n\u2018Oh, I wish I could have held his hand.\u2019 A heartfelt sigh rocks this man\u2019s heavy frame.\n\nCharlotte sobs: \u2018I wish you could have done.\u2019\n\nTim answers: \u2018I think about that all the time.\u2019\n\nHe knew his son\u2019s legs and arms were broken, but, at that time, had no notion of his serious chest injuries or that he was internally bleeding.\n\n\u2018The general consensus was he was going to be OK,\u2019 he says. \u2018When I phoned Charlotte, Bruce answered. I was glad. Telling her would have been the worst thing I\u2019d have ever had to do.\u2019\n\nCharlotte and Bruce headed immediately to the hospital after picking up Niall.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t explain it but I knew we\u2019d lost him,\u2019 she says. \u2018Niall sat in the front of the car and just reached round to the back and grabbed my hand. We don\u2019t know yet when he died because I haven\u2019t been brave enough to ask for the discharge summary from the hospital whether they lost him on the way or not. But I knew he\u2019d gone. I can\u2019t explain it. I just had that feeling in the pit of my stomach.\u2019\n\nCharlotte knows that 16 staff at the John Radcliffe tried to save Harry.\n\nTim says: \u2018The despair was awful. It was like the biggest pain inside. It just comes out. It\u2019s like your brain wants to explode.\u2019\n\nCharlotte nods: \u2018Ever since that day everything hurts. It hurts inside and outside your head. The grief comes out in many ways because we\u2019re not able to grieve. We have to stay focused to try to get justice for Harry.\u2019 The family were told six days after Harry\u2019s funeral, which took place on September 18, that Mrs Sacoolas had left the country.\n\n\u2018We\u2019d just thought this was a very, very clear-cut case and were concentrating on getting Harry\u2019s body back from the Coroner after the post-mortem. We had one day with him at the funeral directors before they had to close the coffin,\u2019 says Charlotte.\n\n\u2018We spent as long as we could with him and left some bits and pieces for him. Harry was a bit of a b****r for driving with his visor up because he liked the air on his face so he always carried a lip balm with him. I placed his lip balm and one of his Kawasaki key rings on his chest.\u2019 Such was this genial young man\u2019s popularity his funeral was attended by more than 300 mourners.\n\n\u2018People say, \u201cOh, you\u2019re coping with it really well.\u201d But we\u2019re not dealing with it,\u2019 says Charlotte. \u2018Niall\u2019s not dealing with it. As soon as you come off camera you break and you have to pick yourself back up because you know you\u2019re going to the next studio to get your story out again. This has to be as far-reaching as possible because we have to get justice for our son.\u2019\n\nThe family collected at Charlotte\u2019s home when police spoke to them on September 24.\n\n\u2018This is a small community,\u2019 says Tim. \u2018There had been so many rumours that the Americans had probably pulled her out so we were expecting it, but it was still gut wrenching. Losing my son was the worst pain I\u2019d ever felt.\n\n\u2018When the police officer told us they couldn\u2019t do anything, that there was less than a 1 per cent chance of getting a prosecution, it was like I\u2019d lost him again. I remember standing in your kitchen,\u2019 he nods at Bruce, \u2018and thinking, \u201cOh my God, you\u2019ve just let her go.\u201d\u2019\n\nCharlotte continues: \u2018We\u2019re not vengeful people but the longer this goes on and we hear nothing from her, the more the anger mounts. We have accepted this is a terrible accident from day one. I want to hear her side of the story.\n\nShe looks at Tracey. \u2018We still can\u2019t understand as mothers ourselves that she thinks it was the right thing to do to get on a plane and run away.\u2019\n\nTracey agrees. \u2018In our opinion diplomatic immunity is to protect a diplomat who is in danger so they can be removed from the danger. Anne Sacoolas was not in danger but Harry lost his life. We, Harry\u2019s family, need that justice.\u2019", "description": "Two days ago, Harry Dunn's mother Charlotte finally forced herself to strip her 19-year-old son's bed.
