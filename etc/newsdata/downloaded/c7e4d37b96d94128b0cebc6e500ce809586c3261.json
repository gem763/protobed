Preliminary investigations have indicated the two crashes, which collectively killed over 300 people, were tied to a new automated control system in which the pilots were not properly trained.\n\n\"Boeing made a calculated decision to rush a re-engined aircraft to market to secure its single-aisle market share and prioritize its bottom line,'' the lawsuit says, according to USA Today.\n\n\"In doing so, Boeing abandoned sound design and engineering practices, withheld critical safety information from regulators and deliberately mislead (sic) its customers, pilots and the public about the true scope of design changes to the 737 MAX,\u201d it added.\n\nThe lawsuit claims Boeing refused to provide compensation when the union sought it from the company. It further asserts Southwest has had to cancel more than 30,000 flights due to the Max grounding.\n\nBoeing spokesman Peter Pedraza told the newspaper the company considers the lawsuit \u201cmeritless,\u201d adding \u201cwe will continue to work with Southwest Airlines and its pilots on efforts to safely return the MAX to service.\u201d\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Boeing for further comment.", "description": "The union that represents Southwest Airlines pilots is suing Boeing, holding the company responsible for what it says is $115 million pilots have lost due to the grounding of Boeing 737 Max planes,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/southwest_den_090519gn2_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
