Meet Aito, the robotic vending machine that comes (slowly) to you", "language": "en", "text": "The world\u2019s largest Coca-Cola bottler has taken a 15% stake in driverless tech company TeleRetail which uses an autonomous robot called \u2018Aito\u2019 to deliver products \u2018quickly\u2019 around industrial sites and in urban areas.\n\nAito can travel distances of up to 30 miles but it is probably not the best option for thirsty users. It has a top speed of 3 mph so at the limit of its range drinkers would have to wait as much as 10 hours for a can of Coke. The robot is intended to travel short distances.\n\nCoca-Cola European Partners CCEP, -5.90% is investing in this and another technology startup through its CCEP Ventures investment arm, it announced on Thursday.\n\nOver the summer it tested Aito at a U.K. theme park called Alton Towers in Staffordshire.\n\nThe robot collected items from a distribution center and delivered them to drinks outlets across the park.\n\nThe technology is different from traditional driverless vehicles in that the delivery robots use satellites and other sensors to \u201csee\u201d their environment and to safely navigate through it.\n\nIt uses artificial intelligence, developed with the support of the European Space Agency, to maneuver around the thousands of visitors at the theme park during the peak summer season.\n\nCCEP Ventures will also take a seat on TeleRetail\u2019s board, to help support the company with its future development ambitions.\n\nIt is also taking a 25% stake in Kol, a French logistics firms that delivers drinks on-demand to customers\u2019 doors in just 30 minutes.\n\nRead: The CEO of this robo-taxi company believes it has the inside track on rivals\n\nNik Jhangiani, finance director of Coca-Cola European Partners, said: \u201cCCEP Ventures finds, funds, and fosters new ideas that help CCEP adapt to new trends, while supporting some of the best startups in the market through our extensive experience and network.\u201d", "description": "Aito travels up to 30 miles but with a top speed of 3 mph it\u2019s not for thirsty drinkers \u2014 it could take up to 10 hours to deliver a can of Coke", "authors": ["Rupert Steiner", "Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT925_cokero_ZG_20191024100159.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
