I got the sense that many countries were cautioning on rushing into this [...]. Countries will have to show extreme caution much before anything is said or moved on this.\u201d\n\n\u2018Stablecoin\u2019 term challenged\n\nSitharaman noted that representatives of other nations had argued against the use of the term \u201cstable currency\u201d or \u201cstablecoin,\u201d but instead emphasize the token\u2019s links to cryptocurrency.\n\nAs reported, Libra has been designated a stablecoin by Facebook \u2014 a type of digital asset designed to mitigate price volatility \u2014 and was initially proposed to be backed by a basket of national fiat currencies, including the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, British pound and Singapore dollar.\n\nSitharaman said that while presentations at the annual meetings had conceded the prospective strengths of such virtual currencies, \u201ceveryone without fail spoke about the challenges together with talking about it as a necessary step forward. So everyone was stepping cautiously on it.\u201d\n\nCircumspection in regard to Libra has indeed been reverberating among citizens, crypto industry figures, governments, regulators and central bankers worldwide.\n\nCurrency wars\n\nWith the yuan not included in Libra\u2019s proposed reserve assets, China has also ratcheted up its existing plans for a central bank digital currency in a bid to protect against the perceived threat to its monetary sovereignty and legal currency status.\n\nThe former governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China argued that \u201cpeople valuing Libra is inseparable from the global dollarization trend.\u201d\n\nNew Indian Express notes the concerns that digital currencies could further compound existing tensions between the global superpowers, especially in regard to currency manipulation.\n\nConcerns over the risks posed to monetary sovereignty among all nations have prompted the United States and others to argue forcefully against the issuance of a global stablecoin.\n\nUnder increasing pressure, Facebook revealed this week that it was open to the idea of using a multitude of stablecoins that represent unique national currencies instead of its original design, noting that while this was not the preferred option for the project, it had to remain agile.\n\nMeanwhile, reports surfaced last month that India was seeing the first signs of an anticipated brain drain, as the government mulls stark legislation that would criminalize all domestic cryptocurrency investments. The ban would compound an existing and much-contested prohibition by the Reserve Bank of India's ban on domestic banks' dealings with crypto-related businesses.", "description": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said that India \u2014 like many others, in his view \u2014 is showing a high degree of caution in regard to Facebook\u2019s Libra", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZWY2Nzg4Y2ViNThmNzMwOTI1NjNhZWJjM2E5ZTY3MmIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
