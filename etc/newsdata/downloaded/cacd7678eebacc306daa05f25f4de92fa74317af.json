Email webnews@mirror.co.uk\n\nCenter Parcs bosses have apologised for the upset caused, but said it was \"simply an unfortunate accident\".\n\nThe injured man, who still has pain in his ribs and back two months later, told the BBC that he and his family had all been on the ride \"countless\" times before.\n\nBut he said that this time, rather than slowing down towards the end of the 142m-course, \"we maintained our speed and were quite high up on the side\".\n\nHe told the BBC: \"We went into thin air and that's why we flipped.\n\n\"The thing that I really remember was the cracking sound of my ribs hitting the side of the flume.\"\n\nParamedics attended and took the man to hospital. He says he still has pain in his ribs and back.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe customer said his niece had an \"impressive bump just above her right eye, bruising along the right side of her chin and a headache\" for about a week after the incident.\n\nMeanwhile, his nephew had a headache for the rest of the day.\n\nCenter Parcs confirmed all three passengers sustained minor injuries.\n\nA park spokesman said that incidents of rafts overturning were \"extremely rare\" and more than 340,000 rafts have travelled safely down the course in the last six months.\n\nFollowing the incident, staff closed the ride and conducted safety checks.\n\n(Image: Center Parcs)\n\nA spokesman said told the BBC that Center Parcs was confident there were \"no issues\" with the ride and staff had correctly loaded the raft.\n\nHe said signs at the entrance and at the top of the Tropical Cyclone ride made it clear to guests that the course was \"thrilling\" and \"fast-paced\" - and that safety briefings are also given by lifeguards before guests begin the ride.\n\nThe ride was fully certified, covered by a risk assessment and control measures were in place to mitigate risks, Center Parcs said.\n\nBut the customer said Center Parcs had shown a \"complete lack of responsibility\" in failing to explain why the raft had overturned.\n\nHe said he felt \"every family that rides the Tropical Cyclone is at a potential risk of their raft overturning\".\n\nCenter Parcs said it takes the safety of its guests \"extremely seriously\" and carries out rigorous checks to ensure all rides are \"as safe as possible\".\n\nWiltshire Council has launched an investigation.\n\nA spokesman told the BBC: \"We are working closely with Center Parcs, and other partners, to determine the best practice moving forward.\"\n\nTropical Cyclone opened at the Longleat holiday village in 2017.\n\nThe ride is described on the Center Parcs website as \"one of the most exciting rides\" in the park with a 142m-course of \"twists, turns and gravity-defying drops\".", "description": "The man suffered suspected broken ribs after the Tropical Cyclone raft capsized at Center Parcs in Longleat, Wilts, in August", "authors": ["Tom Davidson", "Image", "Pa", "Center Parcs"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20536762.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_AWP_050319_Tropical_Cyclone_15jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
