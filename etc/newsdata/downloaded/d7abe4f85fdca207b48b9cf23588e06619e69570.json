(AP) - The New York Giants are probably going to be without wide receiver Sterling Shepard for their Thursday night game against the New England Patriots.\n\nGiants coach Pat Shurmur said Monday that Shepard is back in the concussion protocol for the second time this season after being hurt in Sunday\u2019s 28-10 loss to the Minnesota Vikings. Tight end and leading receiver Evan Engram (knee) and running back Wayne Gallman (concussion) also did not practice Monday.\n\nThe officials made Shepard leave Sunday\u2019s game late in the third quarter after he hit the ground hard trying to catch a long pass from Daniel Jones. He was evaluated for a concussion and returned.\n\nShurmur said Shepard showed up with symptoms of a concussion on Monday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the protocol and we\u2019ll try to get him back,\u201d Shurmur said of Shepard, who also had a concussion in the season opener against Dallas and missed the next game against Buffalo. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back on the field when they say it\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nShepard is second on the team with 25 catches for 267 yards and a touchdown. Engram has 33 catches for 373 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nVeteran Golden Tate, who was suspended for the first four games for using performance-enhancers, returned this past week. Rookie Darius Slayton also has played well and the roster includes veterans Cody Latimer and Cody Core.\n\nThe team has three other tight ends - Rhett Ellison, Garrett Dickerson and Kaden Smith.\n\nThe injuries have become a concern for the Giants (2-3).\n\nStar running back Saquon Barkley has missed the past two games with a high sprain to his right ankle. Shurmur said the 2018 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year was limited at practice Monday and is feeling better than last week. He gave no indication whether he will be ready for the Patriots (5-0).\n\nIf he cannot go, the Giants have only two other running backs on the roster, rookie Jon Hilliman and Eli Penny, who is more of a fullback.\n\nShurmur said there is a chance the Giants would add another running back for the game.\n\nAlso limited on Monday were left tackle Nate Solder (ankle) and linebackers Lorenzo Carter (neck), Alec Ogletree (hamstring) and Josiah Tauaefa (knee). Carter was inactive Sunday and Ogletree was sidelined for the past two.\n\nLinebacker Tae Davis, who missed the past two games with a concussion, practiced without restrictions Monday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The New York Giants are probably going to be without wide receiver Sterling Shepard for their Thursday night game against the New England Patriots.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Canavan"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/vikings_giants_football_98440_c0-185-4423-2763_s1770x1032.jpg?5353ef0105dd95d394123758723693b7bbeaeaea", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
