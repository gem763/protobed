(Photo by Tony Quinn/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nFor a shot at another National League Division Series berth, the Washington Nationals are unsurprisingly going with their ace.\n\nNationals manager Dave Martinez told reporters Friday that Max Scherzer will be the team\u2019s starting pitcher for the NL wild-card game, according to MLB.com\u2019s Jamal Collier. Fellow top starters Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin are also expected to be available out of the bullpen.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMax Scherzer will start the NL Wild Card game on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nDave Martinez just made it official. Both Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin are expected to be available out of the bullpen \u2014 Jamal Collier (@JamalCollier) September 27, 2019\n\nScherzer last pitched for the Nationals on Tuesday and won\u2019t see the mound for the team again until the wild-card game on Oct. 1, giving him a full week of rest.\n\nFacing Scherzer will either be the St. Louis Cardinals or Milwaukee Brewers in a game that could also be either home or away, depending on how every team\u2019s final series of the season shakes out. The Cardinals are currently in first place in the NL Central at 90-69, a game ahead of the 89-70 Brewers. Whoever finishes second in the division will face the 90-69 Nationals, with the team owning the better final record hosting the game.\n\nScherzer was one of three options for Nats\n\nWhile going with Scherzer for a winner-takes-all game is unsurprising for anyone who has watched the last five seasons of Nationals baseball, it might be surprising to hear he only ranks third in bWAR in his own rotation this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat\u2019s because Strasburg (6.3) and Corbin (6.1) both sit ahead of Scherzer (5.8). That trio takes up three of top four spots in the entire NL in bWAR, behind only New York Mets ace Jacob deGrom (7.3).\n\nThose stats come with the large caveat that Scherzer missed time and struggled on the mound with a back injury for much of the second half. It might be of some worry that he has still been struggling, holding a 5.16 ERA in five September starts.\n\nWill Scherzer get his postseason moment?\n\nScherzer\u2019s resume as one of the best pitchers of his generation \u2014 three Cy Young Awards, seven All-Star nods, three strikeout titles, two no-hitters, a 20-strikeout game, two immaculate innings \u2014 is indisputable at this point, but he hasn\u2019t quite looked like an ace in the postseason during his Nationals tenure.\n\nThe Nationals are 0-4 in postseason games in which Scherzer has appeared, with the pitcher holding a modest 3.72 ERA in his four appearances. His most recent appearance was out of the bullpen in Game 5 of the 2017 NLDS against the Chicago Cubs, taking the loss after yielding four runs (two earned) in one inning of work.\n\nWith the Nats\u2019 wild-card game, Scherzer gets a chance at cleaning up the lone blemish on his reputation. He\u2019ll have plenty of back-up in Strasburg and Corbin, but it\u2019s clearly his time to assert himself as the Nationals\u2019 top player, both now and historically.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Despite a 5.16 ERA in September and potentially lingering back injury, the Nationals are going with Max Scherzer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/BVU3W4ydoauS09JEQ7zuRw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04OTQuOTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RULWzilAGJjzsHTusAqa3A--~B/aD0yNzk2O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/b030bde0-e16d-11e9-9bbf-5a9cc3cea24d", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
