Al Green, one of the most vocal advocates for impeachment, complained Thursday that his colleagues' latest resolution establishing that process didn't include accusations of discrimination against President Trump.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee voted earlier to essentially formalize an impeachment investigation. But with committee Democrats largely focused on allegations of obstruction of justice and other issues, Texas Rep. Green lamented it doesn't go far enough.\n\nPELOSI LASHES OUT AT REPORTERS ON IMPEACHMENT\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re moving in the right direction, but I was disappointed that they didn\u2019t cover some other aspects of impeachment, especially those that deal with invidious discrimination,\u201d Green told Fox News, on the sidelines of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate on Thursday night in Houston.\n\nGreen was the first Democrat to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump on the House floor in 2017. He has repeatedly introduced articles since, and the House has repeatedly voted against passage.\n\n\u201cAll of the articles that I\u2019ve actually called to the attention of the House that we have voted on were articles that have dealt with discrimination emanating from the presidency,\u201d he said, referring to the president\u2019s comments referring to \u201csh--hole countries,\u201d and his rhetoric surrounding the riots in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017.\n\n\u201cWhen the president said there were very fine people \u2013 that was not an appropriate thing to do because of the way that impacts other persons in society and cause them to conclude that maybe they can do things they shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Green said.\n\nGreen stopped short of likening Trump to recent mass shooters who have used violent and hateful rhetoric, saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t draw a line between Trump and a shooter\u2026but he did use language very similar.\u201d\n\nMore than half of House Democrats support an impeachment inquiry\u2014including 17 members of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has long expressed skepticism about impeachment, urging Democrats to focus on their legislative agenda instead.\n\nBut when asked by Fox News this week if she supported committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., Pelosi said: \u201cYes, I do.\u201d\n\nHOUSE DEMS MOVE ON IMPEACHMENT\n\n\u201cI think you should characterize it for what it is, it\u2019s a continuation of what we have been doing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, we all work together on these things.\u201d\n\nThe committee\u2019s move to intensify its impeachment investigation comes after former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. Mueller determined there was not evidence sufficient to charge anyone associated with the Trump campaign with criminal conspiracy to coordinate with the Russian government during the 2016 election\u2014the initial basis for the probe. But Democrats have turned to other issues including Trump\u2019s finances and alleged obstruction of justice.\n\n\u201cAll those things are on the table obviously, but they did not put invidious discrimination on the table,\u201d Green said, adding that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d believes it should be included.\n\nMeanwhile, from the White House Friday morning, the president questioned how impeachment could even be an option, touting his record.\n\n\u201cHow do you impeach a President who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our Country? All time best unemployment numbers, especially for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians & Women. More people working today than ever before,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cRebuilt Military & Choice for Vets. Became Number 1 in World & Independent in Energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill soon have record number of Judges, 2 SC Justices,\u201d he continued. \u201cDone more than any President in first 2 1/2 years despite phony & fraudulent Witch Hunt illegally led against him. WIN on Mueller Report, Mueller Testimony & James Comey IG Report, which showed him to be a Disgraced & Dirty Cop.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cRepublicans have unified like never before. You don\u2019t impeach Presidents for doing a good (great!) job. No Obstruction, No Collusion, only treasonous crimes committed by the other side, and led by the Democrats.
