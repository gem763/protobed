Fetzer called the damages awarded by the Dane County jury \"absurd\" and said he would appeal.\n\nPozner testified that he's received harassment and death threats from conspiracy theorists who claimed he was an actor and that his son never existed. A separate defamation lawsuit by Sandy Hook parents against \"Infowars\" host Alex Jones, one of the biggest proponents of the theory that the shooting never happened, is pending.\n\n\u201cI had attempted to be transparent. I published Noah\u2019s death certificate on a social media page I used as a memorial page. And after doing that I was accused of being a fake and a fraud and that changed everything,\u201d he said, according to the Wisconsin State Journal.\n\nAlong with other Sandy Hook parents, Pozner has spent years lobbying Facebook to remove conspiracist videos about the shooting from its platform.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDuring the trial, Pozner said Fetzer's writing caused him to worry for the safety of himself and his family. He emphasized the case was not about First Amendment protections.\n\n\"Mr. Fetzer has the right to believe that Sandy Hook never happened. He has the right to express his ignorance,\" Pozner said. \"This award, however, further illustrates the difference between the right of people like Mr. Fetzer to be wrong and the right of victims like myself and my child to be free from defamation, free from harassment and free from the intentional infliction of terror.\"", "description": "A Wisconsin jury has awarded the father of a boy killed in the Sandy Hook\u00a0Elementary School shooting $450,000 following\u00a0a defamation lawsuit against\u00a0a retired university professor who claimed the massacre never happened.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Noah20Pozner.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
