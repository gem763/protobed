Barring a last-minute breakthrough, Spanish voters will trudge the familiar path back to the ballot box on November 10.\n\nNaturally, S\u00e1nchez and Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias blame each other for the failed negotiations. Their acrimonious parliamentary exchanges on Wednesday underlined the mutual mistrust, and may set the tone for the election campaign.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t push the country again to an election,\u201d S\u00e1nchez told Iglesias. \u201cDon\u2019t give a second opportunity to the right.\u201d\n\n\u201cA coalition government is always preferable to repeating elections,\u201d Iglesias told S\u00e1nchez, warning the Socialist leader that he would have to shoulder the blame if he triggered a new vote for the sake of a few more seats in Congress.\n\nA new election would be a big gamble for S\u00e1nchez\n\nThe crux of their disagreement is whether Podemos should get Cabinet seats: In July, the Socialists offered Iglesias three ministries and a vice-premiership, but the offer was rejected as insufficient. Now S\u00e1nchez has taken that offer off the table while Iglesias insists that Cabinet positions are a prerequisite for a deal. He even offered the possibility of a probationary coalition of one year on Thursday, which S\u00e1nchez also refused.\n\nNext Monday and Tuesday, King Felipe VI is scheduled to meet party leaders to discuss the stalemate. If, as expected, he doesn\u2019t invite S\u00e1nchez to make another attempt to try and get a governing majority, it would mean the die is cast.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always the possibility of a last-minute breakthrough,\u201d one government minister said \u2014 adding, however, that the now \"bitter\" personal relationship between S\u00e1nchez and Iglesias gave little cause for optimism.\n\nRenzi, May...S\u00e1nchez?\n\nA new ballot would extend the political instability that began in 2015, when two upstart parties \u2014 Podemos and the liberal Ciudadanos \u2014 rode a wave of popular discontent following the financial crisis and economic depression. The resulting fragmentation of Spanish politics, which had been dominated by two parties since the restoration of democracy, has since been further complicated by the rise of the far-right party Vox.\n\nA new election would be a big gamble for S\u00e1nchez, and a major distraction just when he is managing to restore Spain's influence in the European Union.\n\nThe European landscape offers abundant examples of politicians who bit off more than they could chew by risking arguably unnecessary votes \u2014 from Italy's Matteo Renzi losing his prime ministership on a constitutional referendum in 2016 to Theresa May squandering her majority in a snap U.K. election in 2017.\n\nOpinion polls predict the Socialists will grow from April\u2019s 29 percent of the vote, while Podemos, Ciudadanos and Vox will lose ground. The Socialists' historic foes, the conservative Popular Party, might manage to make gains at the expense of Vox and Ciudadanos, but they are unlikely to have a chance of toppling the Socialists.\n\nS\u00e1nchez\u2019s calculation appears to be that a new election will not only extend his lead in Congress, but also teach a lesson to those he blames for blocking his mandate: namely Iglesias, who the Socialists believe has been too demanding, and Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera, who has downright refused to cooperate.\n\nDefeating them could encourage Spanish lawmakers to behave more cooperatively, even if the coalition math is unlikely to change drastically.\n\n\u201cPeople will bet on stability and governability,\u201d said a member of the Socialist leadership, pointing out that the electoral trends are disastrous for Podemos and Ciudadanos. The party official added that sooner or later Iglesias and Rivera will have to assume a secondary, more accommodating role in national politics.\n\nPotential upsets\n\n\u201cAn election might not spectacularly upset [the distribution of seats] \u2026 yet it could well change the situation of the political players, not just of the Socialists and Podemos, but also of the conservative Popular Party and Ciudadanos,\u201d said Luc\u00eda M\u00e9ndez, chief political reporter for the newspaper El Mundo.\n\nOther unpredictable factors to throw into the equation include the disruption of a no-deal Brexit ...\n\nM\u00e9ndez believes S\u00e1nchez's Socialists will attempt to drum into Spanish voters' heads the message that Spain is \"living in a disorder, that disorder has been provoked by the new parties \u2026 which haven\u2019t proved to be useful to society, and these are Ciudadanos and Podemos.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is about who has most to win and lose,\u201d said Antonio Maestre, a prominent left-wing journalist. He argued that while Podemos is going through a rough patch with internal disputes and departures of some top figures, and may shed a few seats in Congress, its leaders think the Socialists will still need their support.\n\nOther unpredictable factors to throw into the equation include the disruption of a no-deal Brexit, a further slowdown of the economy \u2014 Spanish employment figures in August were the worst in a decade \u2014 or a sentence against Catalan pro-independence leaders expected in October that could galvanize their supporters.\n\nOn top of that, many commentators and analysts are warning that the leftist electorate might feel so frustrated and disappointed at their leaders\u2019 inability to reach a compromise that they don't turn out to vote at all. In opinion polls, the population at large already perceives politicians as the second biggest problem that their country faces, behind unemployment.\n\nAs one adviser to Rivera of Ciudadanos said of the looming election, \"it\u2019s a coin toss.\"", "description": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez hopes to extend his majority and punish smaller parties for refusing him support.", "authors": ["Diego Torres", "Sophie In", "T Veld", "David M.
