Kennedy announced his ambition to land an astronaut on the moon before the decade was out. Among the huge challenges to overcome was manufacturing a spacesuit which could protect the human body from the dangers of space.\n\nPlaytex were a small firm whose expertise lay in latex moulding bras and girdles. Kassia St Clair\n\nIn The Golden Thread, Kassia St Clair describes the scale of the problem NASA faced.\n\nShe writes: \"Space is the most alien environment in which a human being has survived... In space, temperatures fluctuate between -157\u00b0C in the shade and as high as 154\u00b0 in a sunny spot... there is a great deal of ultraviolet radiation from the sun, which is harmful to our eyes and skin. There is no breathable air.\"\n\nThe company appointed to manufacture the spacesuit was, on the surface, an unusual choice.\n\nSt Clair reports: \"[Playtex] were a small firm - no more than 50 employees in 1962 - whose expertise lay in latex moulding bras and girdles.... The making of what was to become known as the A7-L Omega suit was much more akin to making girdles than anyone at the space agency would have cared to admit. Each suit was fashioned by hand on a sewing floor populated entirely by women - seamstresses, pattern-cutters and makers - using adapted Singer sewing machines, standard pattern templates and the skills both inherent and honed from years of making women's underwear.\"", "description": "How the things we wear and weave have had a major impact on human life.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p0787xx9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
