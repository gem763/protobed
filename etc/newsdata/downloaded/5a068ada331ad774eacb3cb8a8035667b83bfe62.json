A year later it installed a Pledge button at Keflav\u00edk airport, to encourage more visitors to agree to leave places as they found them, park and sleep only where permitted but also to \u201ctake photos to die for without dying for them\u201d and \u201cWhen nature calls, I won\u2019t answer the call on nature.\u201d\n\nIn December 2017 Palau, in the western Pacific, announced a compulsory conservation pledge to the children of Palau that visitors are required to sign on arrival in the country. In September 2018 Hawaii launched the Pono Pledge, which forms part of a new marketing campaign, revealed this week, that aims to encourage responsible, mindful travel and sustainable tourism. New Zealand\u2019s Tiaki Promise was announced in November 2018 and is now promoted on Air New Zealand flights, in tourist offices and through tour operators. This year, Sonoma County, California laid out plans to get one million tourists to commit to \u201ctravel kindly\u201d, part of a strategy aimed at attracting tourists whose values align with the area\u2019s vision for responsible tourism.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Koror, Palau, where tourists are required to sign a conservation pledge on arrival.

Instead of a pledge, the Faroes took drastic action earlier this year, closing the islands for a week when it welcomed 100 volunteers \u2013 out of 3,500 applicants \u2013 who helped repair footpaths alongside local people. The tourist board now plans to make its \u201cClosed for Maintenance\u201d initiative an annual event and is inviting volunteers to sign up for April 2020.\n\nFor all these destinations pledges are part of a long-term vision to balance the need for tourism with a determination to protect natural resources but not everyone is convinced as to their real impact. Responsible Travel, an online holiday directory, this week called into question the growing trend among tour operators to offset the holidays they sell \u2013 and it is equally doubtful about pledges.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sceptical because there\u2019s no evidence that they work,\u201d said founder Justin Francis. \u201cPledges are nothing new: I was studying them 20 years ago when I did a master\u2019s in sustainable tourism. Since then, what we\u2019ve seen most recently is really deteriorating tourism behaviour. Pledges fall short of creating any resources or finances to manage tourism properly.\u201d\n\nInstead of a \u201csuperficial\u201d pledge, Francis advocates tourism taxes that create income for the destination, \u201cas long as the money is ringfenced to improve destinations for locals and future tourists\u201d.\n\nThis month, Venice confirmed that it will charge daytrippers up to \u20ac10pp. The charge does not apply to visitors staying overnight who already pay tax through their hotel.\n\nBut Dr Daisy Fan, a lecturer at Bournemouth\u2019s tourism and hospitality department, was less dismissive of pledges, calling them \u201ca good beginning\u201d, though she admits more needs to be done to educate tourists. \u201cIt\u2019s about forming a mindset in the visitor at the earliest stage, not at the last minute as they arrive.\u201d", "description": "Campaigns to encourage more sustainable and respectful travel are increasing, though some industry figures doubt their power to effect change", "authors": ["Isabel Choat"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e06d2c7492357a1c0228dbcaf69c172a6207232/396_312_4903_2942/master/4903.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eff0186a92690512dd5bd8683faaa68f", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
