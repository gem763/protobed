Normally, deliveries continue into November and December.\n\nCurrently, only one supplier - Sanofi - has indicated this deadline will be missed. And one delivery, of one million doses for people with long-term conditions, will not be shipped until November.\n\nBut Sanofi added it had contingency plans in place in case of problems using the Dover port - and was prepared to fly the doses in if necessary.\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption NHS staff can have the vaccination free, to protect patients and the public\n\nMinisters have also ordered extra supplies from another manufacturer in case of difficulties.\n\n'Extraordinary year'\n\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan van Tam, said there had been \"robust\" planning and he was confident there would not be any problems for those who chose to be vaccinated.\n\n\"We do recognise it is an extraordinary year - that is why we have taken the steps we have,\" he said.\n\nBut Prof Van Tam also dismissed suggestions the UK was set for a bad flu season.\n\nIt has been reported Australia, which is coming to the end of its flu season, has struggled and, as a result, the UK could follow suit.\n\nBut Prof Van Tam said flu was \"unpredictable\" and the latest evidence suggested flu cases had peaked earlier than normal in Australia, sparking alarm.\n\nPay privately\n\nIt is only in the past six years the flu vaccine has been offered to healthy children, via a nasal spray, and this year marks the first time it will be available to all year groups at primary school across the UK.\n\nThe flu programme was extended to children because they are more likely to spread the virus between themselves and on to older, more vulnerable family members.\n\nPrimary pupils can have the vaccine in school, while the other groups can use pharmacies and GPs.\n\nPeople not in one of the target groups can pay privately to be vaccinated if they wish.\n\nSerious illness\n\nProf Yvonne Doyle, of Public Health England, urged people to come forward for the vaccine - the NHS was able to vaccinate less than half of those in some of the target groups last year.\n\n\"Some people think the flu is like the common cold. It's not. It can be a really serious illness and can be deadly for some,\" she said.\n\nAbout 1,700 deaths last year were linked to flu.\n\nDr Jim McMenamin, of Health Protection Scotland, said: \"Getting the vaccine only takes a few minutes and helps to provide protection from flu for around a year.\"", "description": "Nearly half the UK population is being offered a winter flu vaccine - with all primary school pupils eligible for the first time.", "authors": ["Nick Triggle", "Health Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/29FF/production/_108515701_hi054466726.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
