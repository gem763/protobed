With its official announcement in Germany, we can finally reveal what's in store for the world's number two smartphone brand after Samsung. And it's huge.\n\nHuawei Confirms Google Apps Won't Be Available On Mate 30 Huawei has confirmed at the 2019 IFA conference in Berlin that although the Mate 30 series will come with Android 10 pre-installed, the devices will not host any Google apps when the phone launches on September 19. Google previously confirmed the app exclusion after months of turmoil amid US President Trump's allegations of Huawei infrastructure being used to spy on citizens, resulting in a ban on US companies (like Google) working with Chinese companies (like Huawei).

True to the rumours, it comes with Huawei's new Kirin 990 processor, a 6.5-inch OLED display and a huge 4,500 mAh battery, which should give you enough juice for two days.\n\nBut the biggest talking point is just how beastly the four-lens camera array appears to be. On the rear of the phone is a circle full of camera-y goodness. There's a 40MP wide lens and a 40MP ultra-wide lens alongside the 8MP telephoto lens. The fourth lens is a 3D time-of-flight (TOF) lens, which focuses on the depth of a shot, meaning your photos featuring multiple subjects will have better focus and lighting including in low-light situations.\n\nIn terms of how it runs, as expected, it will not have access to Google-licensed apps and services but will run off EMUI 10, an Android Open Source operating system, with apps being accessible through Huawei's own app store, Huawei AppGallery rather than the Google Play Store. The app store allegedly has \"45,000 apps integrated with Huawei Mobile Services core.\"\n\nSpecs\n\nHuawei Mate 30 Pro Display 6.5-inch OLED Cameras Rear: 40MP ultra-wide lens, 40MP wide lens, 8MP telephoto lens, 3D TOF camera.

Pricing is also unreleased at this stage but with the Huawei Mate 20 Pro costing $1599 at launch back in November 2018, you can expect it will be within this ballpark.\n\nWatch this space.", "description": "Huawei's upcoming Mate 30 Pro is one of the most talked-about devices this year and it's as much about the phone as it is about the political turmoil surrounding it.
