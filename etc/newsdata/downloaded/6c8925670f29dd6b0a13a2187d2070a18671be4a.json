Be careful out there!\"\n\nOne Twitter user posted: \"Anyone else had a phone call from Amazon saying about renewing their Prime service? I'm assuming it's a scam.\"\n\nAnother said: \"The latest scam call we had was a delightfully new one - 'Your Amazon account has been hacked and you have been subscribed to Amazon Prime. For more information, press 1'.\"\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson told North Wales Live: \"We take phishing and spoofing attempts on our customers seriously, and will never call a customer for payment outside of our website.\"\n\nThey further advised customers to check the Amazon help pages if they have concerns or receive a call which they believe is not from Amazon.\n\nAdditionally, the Amazon website states: \"If you receive a suspicious phone call claiming to be from Amazon and asking for payment or offering a refund you do not expect, please do not share any personal information, and disconnect immediately.\"\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nAn Action Fraud spokesman said: \"The public have to subscribe to Amazon Prime themselves, and would not be automatically subscribed.\n\n\"If the public do receive this call and are worried that they were subscribed, the advice around this would be from UK Finance's 'Take Five to Stop Fraud' content.\"\n\nThis includes hanging up and contacting Amazon via a number or customer service line advertised on the genuine website - as they will be able to inform you if you are subscribed to Prime.\n\nAction Fraud also reminded to never give out private information or details over the phone, especially in relation to bank accounts.\n\nIf you've already been the victim of fraudulent activity such as this, you should report it to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or use their online fraud reporting tool .", "description": "Criminals tell unsuspecting people they've been subscribed to Amazon Prime - but can press 1 to cancel", "authors": ["Joel Leaver", "James Andrews", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty Images", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10889528.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/PROD-Angry-woman-calling-customer-service.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
