REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nBut one theory about the epic undertaking reserves a special place for a nearby river, now known as the Frome, that may have served as a conduit for ferrying some of the smaller megaliths toward the site on rafts.\n\nToday, the placid waterway is once again playing a supporting role in a grand vision, albeit one its architects want to etch in the statute books, not in stone.\n\nFrome, a market town in the county of Somerset, is petitioning the British government to grant the River Frome \u201clegal personhood\u201d \u2013 in effect, giving it human rights.\n\nIn throwing down this gauntlet, the town has joined a global \u201crights of nature\u201d movement linking river basins in New Zealand to rainforests in South America and towns in the U.S. Midwest. In each case, communities are reimagining ways to harness the law to defend the Earth\u2019s living tissues, and the places they call home. Some have dubbed it Mother Earth\u2019s MeToo moment.\n\nIn practical terms, supporters hope that granting the Frome rights will give lawyers a new avenue to seek redress whenever its waters are sullied by runoff from pig and dairy farms or overflowing sewers. Last month, one of the River Frome\u2019s tributaries turned an unnatural shade of neon blue \u2013 highlighting wider concerns over water quality in British rivers.\n\nBut Peter Macfadyen, an undertaker who redrew Frome\u2019s political map by leading a band of independent candidates to take over the town council, wants to do more than protect one river. In an era of accelerating climate change, Macfadyen and his allies see their quest as part of a struggle to reset the balance between nature and the modern world.\n\n\u201cThis is much bigger than just wanting to punish people for doing something wrong,\u201d said Macfadyen, who also served as Frome\u2019s mayor. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to change a mindset about the environment in which we live.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the nature\u2019s rights movement see Frome as the first test case for the concept in Europe. Nevertheless, the town has been waiting for months for the government to respond. And just as critics have questioned the effectiveness of campaigns in other countries, some in Frome have their doubts.\n\nNeil Howlett, a lawyer who lives by the river in Frome, says he backs many of the community-building steps taken by Macfadyen and other independent local politicians. But he sees the council\u2019s vision for a \u201criver\u2019s rights\u201d bylaw as a distraction.\n\n\u201cHaving a law which is completely outside the cultural basis of the society in which you pass the law doesn\u2019t make for law that works,\u201d Howlett said. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely as an idea. But it\u2019s only lovely as an idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cPROGRAMMED FOR SELF-DESTRUCTION\u201d\n\nAlthough indigenous peoples have long shared the intuition that rivers, mountains and lakes are in some sense living, sentient beings, American legal scholar Christopher Stone framed the idea in contemporary legal terms.\n\nIn his 1972 book, \u201cShould Trees Have Standing?\u201d, Stone argued that voiceless natural features would be best protected by granting them the kinds of legal protections and access to courts usually reserved for two-legged plaintiffs.\n\nThe argument was a novel twist on the long-established principle in the United States that companies can enjoy \u201clegal personality\u201d to distinguish their legal obligations from those of their directors and shareholders.\n\nThe idea is starting to spread. Campaigners won what is hailed as the first \u201crights of nature\u201d courtroom victory in Ecuador in 2011 when judges stopped a road-widening project from dumping gravel in the Vilcabamba River. Around the same time, Bolivia enshrined a far-reaching vision of nature\u2019s rights in a statute known as \u201cThe Law of the Rights of Mother Earth.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, New Zealand\u2019s parliament became the first legislature to acknowledge a river\u2019s legal personhood when it passed a bill recognising the rights of the Whanganui River as an \u201cindivisible and living whole.\u201d\n\nThat same year, a high court in India declared the Ganga and Yamuna rivers legal entities \u2013 along with two Himalayan glaciers and their meadows, waterfalls and forests. Colombia\u2019s constitutional court made a similar move for the Atrato River basin, where riparian communities face illegal gold mining and paramilitary violence. This summer, Bangladesh recognised the rights of all its rivers.\n\nAlthough legal systems in many developing countries were implanted during colonial times, nature\u2019s rights campaigns in Europe and North America represents a role reversal in which \u201ceco-cratic\u201d indigenous worldviews are enjoying a revival.\n\nAdvocates see this new \u201cEarth jurisprudence\u201d as a skeleton key to unlock a shift away from the endless pursuit of economic growth, regardless of the ecological consequences.\n\n\u201cThe current system is programmed for self-destruction, and the legal system is the enabler,\u201d said Mumta Ito, a lawyer and founder of Nature\u2019s Rights, a Scotland-based advocacy group, which is advising Frome town council. \u201cThe only way we\u2019ll be able to change things is by creating a new operating system with nature\u2019s rights at its core.\u201d\n\n\u201cFLATPACK DEMOCRACY\u201d\n\nAlthough the quest to win legal personhood for the River Frome was started barely a year ago, the roots of the campaign stretch back to a meeting at the Griffin pub in Frome one evening in 2011.\n\nFed up with party divisions hobbling the town council, Macfadyen and a group of like-minded collaborators resolved to stand as independents at the next elections.\n\nNestling in a shallow bowl of hills and noted for picturesque cobbled lanes, Frome has long been a magnet for free thinkers. But in a town of almost 27,000 people, the mavericks had never attempted a takeover.\n\nSurprising even themselves, the Independents for Frome movement won 10 seats on the 17-seat council with their model of a new participatory form of decision-making.\n\nIn 2015, the Independents swept all 17 seats, prompting the Frome Times to dub the town \u201cThe People\u2019s Republic of Frome.\u201d In elections this May, independents won almost 80% of the vote.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, Macfadyen led Reuters on a tour of some council-backed projects grouped loosely along the river, whose green-brown waters curve gently through the town. Wildflowers, nettles and brambles had been deliberately allowed to run riot on its steep, shaded banks.\n\nNear the bridge in the town centre, Frome\u2019s \u201cshare shop\u201d allows people to rent items such as power tools, musical instruments or camping gear at low rates. Nearby, a community fridge means nobody\u2019s excess fresh vegetables need go to waste.\n\nThe town council also backed a new renewable energy cooperative, which raised \u00a3300,000 from locals to put solar panels on buildings such as the health centre and football club.\n\nMacfadyen laid out step-by step instructions for running a town council in his book \u201cFlatpack Democracy\u201d \u2013 a play on the idea that thriving localism could be replicated at scale like self-assembly furniture. Inspired by Frome\u2019s example, independents have taken over more than 20 other town councils and have strong representation on another 20, Macfadyen says.\n\nJamie Kelsey Fry, a contributing editor at the New Internationalist magazine, co-founded a similar initiative in the neighbouring county of Devon. He sees the campaigns as part of a \u201cnew municipalism\u201d movement reshaping politics in cities as diverse as Barcelona in Spain, Jackson in Mississippi and Valparaiso in Chile \u2013 their organisers often driven at least in part by concerns over climate change.\n\n\u201cThese groups are going to become exceptionally valuable, because as society functioning in its normal, business-as-usual way begins to collapse, we\u2019re going to have to be in a position to look after ourselves,\u201d Kelsey Fry said.\n\nA NEW DEAL FOR NATURE?\n\nAlthough the rights of nature movement is growing fast, turning its aspirations into effective restraints on commercial interests remains a challenge.\n\nIn the United States, the city of Toledo, Ohio, voted in February to amend its charter to state that the giant Lake Erie, plagued by toxic algae blooms, had a right to \u201cexist, flourish, and naturally evolve.\u201d This summer, state lawmakers quashed the move, saying nature did not have appropriate standing.\n\nIn the case of Frome, legal practitioners would be astonished if the government approves the town\u2019s draft bylaw, partly because there are already laws protecting the river.\n\nFor example, in 2017, a court in the nearby city of Bath fined a Somerset farmer \u00a322,000 for allowing slurry to spill into the water. The contamination had turned the River Frome brown and foul-smelling and killed at least 1,700 fish.\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\nFrome town council said the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government informed it last week that a decision on its application was still pending. The ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWith the world\u2019s water bodies facing growing pressure from the extremes of heat, drought and rainfall driven by climate change, Macfadyen argues that any initiative that helps people to look at nature with fresh eyes is worthwhile.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the situation we\u2019re in because we\u2019ve misunderstood our position in the ecosystem,\u201d Macfadyen said. \u201cAnd unfortunately, we were wrong. We can\u2019t do what we like. If we pour poison over everything, it comes back to bite us.\u201d", "description": "Nobody knows exactly how ancient masons, wielding chisels made from deer antlers, managed to build Stonehenge, the standing circle that has enchanted southern England for thousands of years.", "authors": ["Matthew Green", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428351826&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890W6", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
