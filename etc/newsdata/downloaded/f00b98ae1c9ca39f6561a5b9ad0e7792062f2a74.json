That portion of the letter was released publicly by the National Sanctuary Collective.\n\n\n\nThe migrants had called the fines an intimidation tactic, intended to scare them into leaving sanctuary. Under ICE policy, arrests of illegal immigrants are generally not made at churches, hospitals and schools.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s prompted a number of migrants to take up residence at churches, using them as a shield against deportation.\n\n\n\nEdith Espinal, who\u2019s been living in sanctuary in a Columbus, Ohio, church for two years, got a notice over the summer saying she owed nearly $500,000 for defying deportation orders for so long.\n\n\n\nAfter the cancelation, she claimed victory Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo me this is an example of what speaking out and organizing can accomplish,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\n\n\nHilda Ramirez, in sanctuary at an Austin, Texas, church, was served with a $303,620 fine notice in July. Hers was also canceled.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe had the law on our side,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\n\n\nICE had issued nine fines. Eight of them have been withdrawn. But the agency said each of them has been ordered removed, remains a fugitive, and is a priority for deportation.\n\nThese individuals are subject to final orders of removal and they remain in the United States in violation of law,\u201d the agency said. \u201cICE will pursue enforcement of these removal orders using any and all available means, and has reserved the right to reassess fines in these cases.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
