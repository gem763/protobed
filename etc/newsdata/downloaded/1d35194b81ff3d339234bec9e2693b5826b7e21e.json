And a good thing too: I spent 15 minutes on Sunday trying to convince a Trump-supporting family member that yes, Republican congressmen really are attending these closed-door depositions, and yes, they really are being allowed to question the witnesses extensively. He was incredulous. I guess that Matt-Gaetz-led stunt at the SCIF last week had the desired effect of convincing casual news watchers that Republicans have been so completely shut out of the Democrats\u2019 process that they had no choice but to barge in on a hearing to gain access.\n\nNever mind that Gaetz himself is a member of Nadler\u2019s Judiciary Committee and has a seat with his name on it waiting for him at some of the juiciest hearings. Pelosi:\n\nThis week, we will bring a resolution to the Floor that affirms the ongoing, existing investigation that is currently being conducted by our committees as part of this impeachment inquiry, including all requests for documents, subpoenas for records and testimony, and any other investigative steps previously taken or to be taken as part of this investigation. This resolution establishes the procedure for hearings that are open to the American people, authorizes the disclosure of deposition transcripts, outlines procedures to transfer evidence to the Judiciary Committee as it considers potential articles of impeachment, and sets forth due process rights for the President and his Counsel. We are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump Administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives.\n\nThe key quote is the final sentence. Pelosi\u2019s worried that the Democrats\u2019 court victory on Friday might not hold up on appeal, especially before the Supreme Court. Granted, she could always hold a floor vote officially authorizing the inquiry later if she loses, but Democrats don\u2019t want the impeachment process to linger while litigation plays out. The longer this drags on, the more it\u2019ll interfere with the presidential primaries. In fact, per the NYT, the reason Pelosi stressed in her letter that the administration has no power amid a formal impeachment inquiry to withhold evidence isn\u2019t because she\u2019s planning to fight Trump in court on that point, it\u2019s because she isn\u2019t planning to. \u201cHouse Democrats will forgo using the federal courts to try to compel testimony from recalcitrant witnesses in their impeachment inquiry,\u201d says the Times, and will \u201cinstead use the lack of cooperation to bolster their case that President Trump has abused his office and obstructed Congress\u2019s investigation.\u201d Pelosi isn\u2019t going to sue Trump over this, in other words, she\u2019s going to add obstruction of justice to the articles of impeachment and force Senate Republicans to vote on that. If nothing else, impeaching Trump for blocking evidence instead of suing him over it will speed the process up.\n\nThere\u2019s a procedural risk to formalizing the impeachment process in that it might mean new powers for Republicans on the committee, like calling their own witnesses, but that risk is growing smaller. At some point, Trump will gain the right to call his own witnesses, even if he has to wait until there\u2019s a trial in the Senate. And Pelosi, Nadler, and Schiff may have heard enough damning testimony from the likes of Bill Taylor and Gordon Sondland by now that they\u2019re calculating there just aren\u2019t a lot of exonerating witnesses available for Republicans to call. The boost in legitimacy that the inquiry will receive once Trump can no longer complain that it\u2019s being conducted without an authorizing vote is probably worth more to Pelosi now than the cost of handing new procedural powers to the GOP.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not like the papers are filled with quotes from Republicans bellowing that they have evidence that Trump did no wrong on Ukraine if only the damned Democrats would let them present it. The quotes in the paper are more like \u2026 these:\n\n\u201cIt feels like a horror movie,\u201d said one veteran Republican senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly describe the consensus\u2026 \u201cThere\u2019s frustration. It feels to everyone like they\u2019re just digging a hole and making it worse. It just never ends. . . . It\u2019s a total [expletive] show,\u201d said one Republican strategist who has been advising a number of top senators and who, like several others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid\u2026 \u201cWhat\u2019s causing the most pause is, what else is out there? What is around the corner?\u201d said a second Republican strategist in regular contact with congressional leaders. \u201cIf they say something in defense of the president or against the impeachment inquiry now, will they be pouring cement around their ankles?\u201d\n\nWhat makes it worse, said Rick Santorum to WaPo, is that there\u2019s no presidential charm offensive towards the wider public from Trump as there was from Clinton during the 1998 impeachment. Trump believes to his core that he doesn\u2019t need to please anyone except his own base; he has the numbers to win if he can just turn them out en masse, or so he thinks, so that\u2019s what he attempts to do. Republicans on the Hill are much less certain. If the president\u2019s doing nothing to appeal to swing voters, he\u2019s not just gambling with his own chances next year, he\u2019s gambling with theirs.\n\nPelosi also knows that the polling on whether to begin an impeachment inquiry is solidly in Democrats\u2019 favor at this point \u2014 53/42 on average, according to FiveThirtyEight. Since nearly the entire Democratic caucus is already on record as supporting the inquiry, the risk in formalizing the process with a floor vote is minimal, although there are reports of the usual hand-wringing among moderates that any vote will be used against them later. I wonder who\u2019s going to break the bad news to them that they\u2019ll need to vote on the articles of impeachment themselves eventually even if Pelosi had successfully blocked a vote on formalizing the inquiry. If Senate Republicans have to take a tough vote on impeachment, so do you, chumps.\n\nHere\u2019s Trey Gowdy yesterday reiterating his support for closed-door hearings \u2014 but only if there are no leaks afterward. You can\u2019t claim that the integrity of the investigation requires deposing witnesses in private and then run out to the camera banc a la Adam Schiff to dribble out the most damning revelations afterward. Speaking of which, one other detail of note about the Democratic resolution: Both the Times and Politico are reporting that it\u2019ll likely contain language that would allow congressional staff, i.e. lawyers, to do some of the questioning of witnesses. Politico notes that that\u2019s likely a reaction to the circus of Corey Lewandowski\u2019s hearing last month, when the only questioner who seemed to put him on the spot with a tough query was a Democratic staff attorney.", "description": "\"Nobody is above the law.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/n-4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
