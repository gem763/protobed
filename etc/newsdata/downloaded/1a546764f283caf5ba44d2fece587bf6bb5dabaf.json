For the first time since 1933, you\u2019re waking up in a World Series town. Even if the Washington Nationals aren\u2019t your team, this might be your city, so soak it in. There\u2019s a lot to learn from the Nats, a team that was counted out by just about everyone during its struggles. But, for now, listen to the great philosopher DAVEY MARTINEZ (he\u2019s the manager, if the Nats aren\u2019t your thing): \u201cOften, bumpy roads lead to beautiful places, and this is a beautiful place.\u201d\n\nWASHINGTON POST SPORTS FRONT: \u201cNationals\u2019 league\u201d \u2026 Front-page image\n\n-- THE WORLD SERIES begins Tuesday on the road.

He can speak to the morale and administration strategy in Foggy Bottom.\n\nREPUBLICANS, MEANWHILE, seemed a bit confounded in how they\u2019ll approach McKinley. A few told us they had no idea what he would say, and didn\u2019t know much about him. One GOP lawmaker mentioned that they are going to try to press him on whether he sought out derogatory information from other State employees to denigrate President DONALD TRUMP.\n\nINTERNAL AFFAIRS \u2026 NYT: \u201cWhite House Is Said to Open Internal Review of Ukraine Call,\u201d by Julian Barnes, Maggie Haberman and Mike Schmidt: \u201cPresident Trump has for weeks sought to unmask the whistle-blower who shed light on his Ukraine dealings. But instead aides have fixated on one another: Advisers began a fact-finding review that some fear is a hunt for a scapegoat, according to White House aides and other people familiar with it.\n\n\u201cEven as the impeachment inquiry intensifies in Congress, White House lawyers are leading their own review, the people said. They are seeking to understand White House officials\u2019 actions around Mr. Trump\u2019s July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, which is central to the whistle-blower\u2019s allegation that Mr. Trump abused his power.\n\n\u201cThe lawyers\u2019 inquiry centers on why one of their colleagues, the deputy White House counsel John A. Eisenberg, placed a rough transcript of the call in a computer system typically reserved for the country\u2019s most closely guarded secrets. Mr. Trump later directed that a reconstructed transcript be released amid intensifying scrutiny from House Democrats.\u201d NYT\n\n-- \u201cBolton, Mulvaney on Opposite Sides of Pivotal Ukraine Debate,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Michael Bender and Rebecca Ballhaus: \u201cThe two aides who missed the call \u2014 Mick Mulvaney and John Bolton \u2014 represented two poles of a fierce internal White House debate over an issue now at the center of a House impeachment inquiry: Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. ...\n\n\u201cMr. Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff and director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, carried out the president\u2019s order to suspend nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. Mr. Bolton, who has since resigned as national security adviser, protested the move and \u2014 before the hold on the money was lifted \u2014 promised Ukrainian officials during a visit to Kyiv in August that the U.S. wouldn\u2019t revoke it.\u201d WSJ\n\n-- WAPO: \u201cWhite House directed \u2018three amigos\u2019 to run Ukraine policy, senior State department official tells House investigators,\u201d by Paul Kane, Karoun Demirjian and Rachael Bade: \u201cActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney organized a meeting this spring in which officials were determined to take Ukraine policy out of the traditional channels, putting Energy Secretary Rick Perry, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and special U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker in charge instead, a top State Department official told lawmakers Tuesday.\n\n\u201cGeorge Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Ukraine, told House investigators he was instructed to \u201clay low,\u201d focus on the five other countries in his portfolio and defer to Volker, Sondland and Perry \u2014 who called themselves the \u2018three amigos\u2019 \u2014 on matters related to Ukraine, Rep.

The letter\n\n-- TUESDAY WAS AN INTERESTING DAY on this front. There were reports early yesterday -- from POLITICO and NBC -- that House Democratic leadership was calling around, sounding lawmakers out about a vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry. Pelosi was asked about it, and said she would address it later in the day.\n\nTHEN, IN THE LATE AFTERNOON, Dem leadership was getting ready to meet, and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told us on his way into the room that it was going to be discussed in the meeting. While they were in that meeting, Pelosi\u2019s team alerted a news conference at 6:30 p.m. -- a rare time for a press event, especially on a Tuesday with Congress just back in session. The Hill press corps thought news was coming. Then, our aforementioned colleagues Bres, Heather and Sarah reported that no, Pelosi would not allow a vote, setting up a quite anticlimactic press conference. (Note: Pelosi invited House Intel Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to participate in the news conference with her, and sat in the seats with reporters for part of the event.)\n\nONE COULD ARGUE the wisdom of such a vote in either direction -- and many of our sources have. TRUMP\u2019s White House and its allies said he would not participate in impeachment without such a vote -- so, by holding a vote, Democrats could take away this excuse. And it would arguably be a tough vote for some Republicans who have privately complained that they don\u2019t know where this story ends for Trump. But it would also be a tough vote for some Democrats. And there are many Democrats who believe holding a vote would amount to allowing the president and Republicans to dictate their actions.\n\nPELOSI, at that news conference: \u201cAll roads seem to lead to Putin with the president, though, isn\u2019t it so?\u201d\n\nDEBATE RECAP \u2026\n\n-- THE FACTS OF LIFE: \u201cWarren's charmed campaign just entered a brutal new phase,\u201d by Ryan Lizza in Westerville, Ohio: \u201cElizabeth Warren has enjoyed many of the trappings of a front-runner: the polling lead in Iowa and New Hampshire, a near-tie with Joe Biden nationally, explosive fundraising, big crowds. The only thing missing was the scrutiny and sniping from competitors that normally accompanies the rise of a new primary leader.\n\n\u201cThat changed on Tuesday night at Otterbein University, a small college outside Columbus, Ohio. Otterbein was named after the founder of the United Brethren in Christ, but the mood was anything but brotherly as Warren faced a barrage of criticisms from most of the other 11 Democrats on stage.\n\n\u201cThe candidate who brags about having a plan for everything was pilloried for not detailing how she would pay for her most expensive proposal. She was accused \u2014 sometimes subtly, sometimes explicitly \u2014 of being naive, dishonest, not adequately respecting her colleagues\u2019 ideas, tearing people down, and failing to enact major legislation. She was attacked for believing in policies that were \u2018punitive\u2019 and a theory of governing that was a \u2018pipe dream.\u2019\n\n\u201cWarren\u2019s biggest gains have come since the last debate, so Tuesday's debate was the natural point for a more full-throated engagement from the other candidates.\u201d POLITICO \u2026 Check out Eugene Daniels\u2019 recap video of the attacks on Warren\n\n-- JOHN HARRIS on the two new dynamics at play Tuesday night: \u201cThe first was the degree of critical focus on Sen. Elizabeth Warren, reflecting a calculation that she, rather than former Vice President Joe Biden, has the momentum in the race and is setting the agenda for the party. She took in the glare for the largest share of the three-hour debate without wilting, or receding for significant chunks of the evening (as she did in previous encounters) when the issues shifted away from terrain where she is most comfortable.\n\n\u201cThe second dynamic was an honest illumination of the party\u2019s left-vs.-center debate. In past encounters, this conversation often was portrayed as a choice between \u2018activists\u2019 and \u2018establishment,\u2019 or between bold principles and expedient moderation.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- WAPO\u2019S DAN BALZ: \u201cThe Democratic debates haven\u2019t changed much?

O\u2019Brien, and the State Department\u2019s special envoy for Syrian affairs, James F. Jeffrey \u2014 is part of a scrambled effort to wrest back control of a chaotic situation in Syria that has endangered American forces there even as they prepared to leave. \u2026\n\n\u201cMr. Trump has long viewed his personal relationships with leaders, including Mr. Erdogan, as key to accomplishing his foreign policy goals. But Mr. Trump\u2019s failure in an Oct. 6 phone call to outline the consequences for Mr. Erdogan if he moved his troops into Syria has forced the White House to deal with the consequences.\u201d NYT\n\n\u2026 UH, GUYS, DID YOU READ THIS? -- REUTERS: \u201cErdogan says Turkey will never declare ceasefire in northern Syria\u201d: \u201c\u2018They say \u201cdeclare a ceasefire.\u201d We will never declare a ceasefire,\u2019 Erdogan said. \u2018They are pressuring us to stop the operation.

But now GOP lawmakers are dialing back their direct criticism of the president \u2014 instead working with Trump, dinging Democrats and trying to move forward.\u201d\n\nHAPPENING TODAY -- Trump will meet with Republican and Democratic leadership, as well as the chairs and ranking members of the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, at the White House at 3 p.m. to discuss Turkey.

Giuliani privately urged President Trump in 2017 to extradite a Turkish cleric living in exile in the United States, a top priority of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to multiple former administration officials familiar with the discussions.\n\n\u201cGiuliani, a Trump ally who later became the president\u2019s personal attorney, repeatedly argued to Trump that the U.S. government should eject Fethullah Gulen from the country, according to the former officials, who spoke on the condition on anonymity to describe private conversations.\n\n\u201cTurkey has demanded that the United States turn over Gulen, a permanent U.S. resident who lives in Pennsylvania, to stand trial on charges of plotting a 2016 coup attempt against Erdogan.

Among them was the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which subjects the city\u2019s special U.S. trading status to annual reviews and provides for sanctions against officials deemed responsible for undermining its \u2018fundamental freedoms and autonomy.\u2019\u201d Bloomberg\n\nLITTLE ROCKET MAN -- \u201cKim Jong Un, Astride a Pale Horse, Urges Self Reliance in Face of U.S. Sanctions,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Timothy Martin and Dasl Yoon in Seoul: \u201cMr. Kim\u2019s comments suggest Pyongyang\u2019s hardened stance on nuclear talks with Washington isn\u2019t softening.

The discrepancies made the buildings appear more profitable to the lender \u2014 and less profitable to the officials who set the buildings\u2019 property tax.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Trump told the lender that he took in twice as much rent from one building as he reported to tax authorities during the same year, 2017. He also gave conflicting occupancy figures for one of his signature skyscrapers, located at 40 Wall Street.\u201d ProPublica\n\nBEYOND THE BELTWAY -- \u201cAmazon drops additional $1 million-plus into Seattle City Council races, with ballots out this week,\u201d by The Seattle Times\u2019 Daniel Beekman and Jim Brunner: \u201cAmazon is dropping an additional $1 million-plus into Seattle\u2019s pivotal City Council races, boosting its spending on politics in its hometown this year to an unprecedented $1.45 million. ...\n\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s outlay is the largest \u2018in anyone\u2019s memory\u2019 by a single entity in a Seattle election cycle, said Wayne Barnett, executive director of the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission.

In addition to being spouses, parents, children or friends of the servicemember or veteran, caregivers also step up and serve as doctors, nurses, therapists, financial planners, drivers and more. In some cases, they even set aside their own careers to care for those who served our nation. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 25% of caregivers spend more than 40 hours per week fulfilling this responsibility. And caregivers are often silent about their responsibilities.
