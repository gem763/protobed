Robinson Worldwide to Double Spending on Freight Technology", "language": "en", "text": "C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc., the biggest freight broker in North America, will double its technology spending over the next five years as it fends off challenges from a growing field of digital startups.\n\nThe Eden Prairie, Minn.-based company plans to spend $1 billion to hire more data scientists, engineers and developers to expand its technology and develop new services in an estimated $86.5 billion U.S. domestic market for managing freight transportation.\n\nThe spending plan comes as digital freight-booking startups such as Uber Technologies Inc. \u2019s Freight unit, Seattle-based Convoy and New York-based Transfix Inc. are jockeying to take a bigger slice of the truck-brokerage market with technology that aims to connect truckers with shippers more efficiently.\n\nTheir push to automate the manual processes in booking freight shipments, including mobile apps and clear views of capacity and pricing, is helping reshape freight brokerage.\n\nThat could reduce profitability for the middlemen that arrange the transport of goods for manufacturers, retailers and other businesses, Stephens Inc. analyst Jack Atkins wrote in a recent research note.\n\nSome of the newer digital brokers \u201cappear to be offering aggressive market rates to both small carriers and shippers in an effort to build scale and take market share,\u201d Mr. Atkins wrote. \u201cThese market players are now big enough to impact market pricing, and we believe this is causing established players to accelerate technology investments to drive higher productivity as they look to defend or expand market share.\u201d\n\nEstablished transportation and logistics companies including XPO Logistics Inc. and J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. are also spending millions to automate and digitize their brokerage operations. XPO Logistics has increased its capital spending from $504 million in 2017 to a planned $650 million this year, the company said, much of it going toward technology.\n\nC.H. Robinson Chief Executive Bob Biesterfeld downplayed the impact of the startups, noting the company is adding newly available technology at a rapid rate and that, after all, it handles far more business than its competitors, both tech-forward operators and traditional middlemen.\n\nC.H. Robinson CEO Bob Biesterfeld Photo: C.H. Robinson\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in the freight-matching business really since the deregulation of transportation in 1980,\u201d Mr. Biesterfeld said in an interview. \u201cWe are around three times bigger than the next largest North American brokerage provider, and somewhere around 14 times larger than the combination of the two largest digital upstart brokerages.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1905 as a wholesale produce brokerage house, C.H. Robinson last year generated $16.6 billion in gross revenue from brokerage, global freight forwarding and other business lines.\n\nThe company is by far the largest player in a highly fragmented U.S. market. Research firm Armstrong & Associates estimates the domestic transportation management market, which includes brokerage and other logistics services, generated $86.5 billion in revenue last year. C.H. Robinson\u2019s North American Surface Transportation segment, which provides trucking and other freight services, counted $11.2 billion in gross revenue last year.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nC.H. Robinson has rolled out its own transportation management system that connects the company\u2019s customers and carriers and allows tracking of shipments across all modes and geographies. That technology platform includes mobile apps for carriers and drivers and connects to the software programs that bigger trucking companies use to manage their fleets.\n\nMore than 60% of the broker\u2019s interactions with carriers are fully digital, as are about three-quarters of \u201call of the customer load tenders and customer communication,\u201d Mr. Biesterfeld said. \u201cPut all that together and it sounds like that disrupter story line. We really believe that we have been the original company in this space, matching supply and demand.\u201d\n\nHe sees the rise of digital operators such as Uber Freight, which last week announced plans to hire thousands of employees for a new headquarters in Chicago, a key logistics hub, as \u201csomewhat of a validation of the model we\u2019ve built,\u201d he said. He believes the move signals that Uber Freight is on the lookout for workers with logistics experience.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re based in Silicon Valley, I don\u2019t know that you move to Chicago to hire data scientists and engineers,\u201d said Mr. Biesterfeld.\n\nAcquisitions have helped fuel C.H. Robinson\u2019s growth, including its 2015 purchase of Freightquote.com, then one of the largest internet-based freight brokers, for $365 million. But Mr. Biesterfeld dismisses the idea that C.H. Robinson could accelerate freight\u2019s technology drive more directly by acquiring one of the digital startups.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t frankly think that they bring anything to market that we don\u2019t have already in our tech, either what\u2019s implemented or what\u2019s in our tech road map,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we believe that our service extends so far beyond where they are focused or where they are, it wouldn\u2019t be additive to us.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com", "description": "C.H.
