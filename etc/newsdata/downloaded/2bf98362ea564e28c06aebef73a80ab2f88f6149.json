In our house, the extent of financial planning could be described as \"try to pay the bills.\" There wasn't as much planning as there was triage \u2014 trying to get to a utility before the electric got turned off, or paying rent before the landlord really lost patience.\n\nNow that I'm an adult, I'm in a more comfortable financial situation. I'm able to pay the bills each month without stress, and my kids have never been without utilities.\n\nStill, I often feel behind the ball financially. I'm still paying off five figures in student loan debt from my college degree, and my retirement is woefully underfunded.\n\nGiven that situation, I thought there wasn't much that a financial planner could offer me. Even as I started writing regularly about finances, I resisted the urge to meet with a professional. I thought that if someone looked at my finances they'd either laugh me out of their office, or deliver condescending advice like \"pay down debt and invest.\"\n\nHowever, it turns out that meeting with a financial planner has benefits, even for people who are young or \"behind\" in their financial journeys.\n\n\"Any time I meet with someone who voices these feelings of not 'having enough,' I tell them that everyone, from the doctor to the doorman, can benefit from financial planning,\" said Stephen Gunter, a certified financial planner. \"Financial planning isn't dependent on how much money someone has, it's dependent on that person having specific financial goals and a willingness to take steps to achieve those goals.\"\n\nHere's how I convinced myself I needed to meet with a financial planner now, not later.\n\nBuilding financial literacy\n\nMy parents didn't know much about finances, so they couldn't really teach me the best ways to manage my money. But even in households that have better control over their money, parents often don't pass along important financial lessons to their kids. Add to that the fact that most schools don't cover personal finance, and it's no surprise that many young adults feel lost when it comes to managing their money.\n\nFinancial planners can help close that gap. Meeting with a financial planner, even if you have debt or aren't ready to begin investing quite yet, can help you understand how best to utilize the money you have today in order to maximize the money you'll have in the future.\n\nGet started on your financial journey.

With a better understanding of these terms, you'll be able to use them to get ahead financially.\n\n\"Education comes to mind as the number one benefit an adviser can give to a young client with relatively few assets,\" said Joseph Polakovic, owner and CEO of Castle West Financial in San Diego, California. \"The right financial planner is like the right coach.\"\n\nYou wouldn't compete in a game without a coach on the sidelines, so why start at the game of life without the same guidance?\n\nTime is of the essence\n\nWhen you're young, you probably don't have lots of money, but you do have lots of time. Investing early is the greatest way to build your wealth in the stock market. Meeting with a financial planner can help you make the best choices with your money in order to start investing sooner. That can pay off big in the long term.\n\n\"Typically, the best asset that the younger individuals have is time,\" Polakovic says. \"A lot of the time the benefit from meeting with a planner is not instantaneous, but comes over time. Starting on the right path is very important. Getting perspective is very important.\"\n\nFor example, I want to know more about balancing retirement savings with debt payoff. Planners can crunch the numbers to help me decide what debt to focus on, and which (lower-interest) debt I shouldn't worry about as much because I could make more investing that money over time.\n\nFinding the right planner\n\nFinding a financial planner who will keep your best interests in mind is critical, which is why you should always and only work with a fee-only planner.\n\nCertified financial planners (who are licensed by the Certified Financial Planning Board) are fiduciaries, meaning they're required to act in your best interest at all times.\n\nThey won't accept commission for selling you certain products, which saves you from a constant sales pitch and from potentially making a bad investment, and their focus will be on helping you reach your financial goals.\n\nThey may charge a percentage of assets under management, a flat rate, an hourly fee, or a monthly retainer. Other financial advisers, who may use terms like \"fee-based\" or \"commission-based,\" are not fiduciaries and should be avoided.\n\nGetting over the hesitation\n\nThere's a lot of shame tied up in finances. It's embarrassing to admit that I don't have it all together financially. I have too many student loans and I know I'm not saving enough. Taking a full, honest look at my financial situation and receiving professional input makes me feel super vulnerable.\n\nStill, I know that the benefits of meeting with a financial planner outweigh the potential awkwardness of the meeting.\n\nI hope that when my husband and I meet with a planner we'll be able to discuss our goals, and tweak where we direct our money in order to streamline our progress toward those. Even though we're still in debt and not ready for large-scale investing, we want to feel that we're working toward the financial milestones that matter to us.\n\nI'm glad we've decided to meet with a financial planner now, rather than waiting until we reach an arbitrary level of achievement to tap into this resource.", "description": "When you grow up poor, you don't necessarily learn the kinds of money lessons that can help you build your net worth in the long run.", "authors": ["Kelly Burch"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8bad022e22af3f7f61bff7-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
