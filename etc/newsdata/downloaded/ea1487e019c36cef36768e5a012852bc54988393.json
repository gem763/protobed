Facebook officially debuted its new dating service in the U.S. yesterday, and that very sentence should cause privacy advocates a bit of alarm\u2014especially since it was only a few days ago when the news hit that another security gaffe exposed the phone numbers of millions of Facebook accounts to the world.\n\nWhile I doubt a hack will ever directly target your list of admirers and secret crushes, you should still think long and hard about your privacy if, or when, you decide to let Facebook be your new matchmaker. Your safety is important, and limiting what you share\u2014and how you share it\u2014is one of the best things you can do on any social network, let alone a dating service.\n\nI\u2019ve played around with Facebook Dating, and while the new service doesn\u2019t have a ton of options you can adjust to manage how your data is used, you do have a few options.\n\nGetting started with Facebook Dating\n\nFacebook bakes a few privacy options into the initial setup process for Facebook Dating, so let\u2019s go over that real quick.\n\nTo jump into the grand world of online dating\u2014via Facebook\u2014pull up its mobile app and tap on the hamburger icon in the lower- or upper-right corner. Look for \u201cDating,\u201d identifiable by a little tagline and a big ol\u2019 heart:\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nThe next many screens should be pretty self-explanatory\u2014setting up the Dating service isn\u2019t that difficult to figure out\u2014but I wanted to highlight a few points related to privacy.\n\nWho can see that you\u2019re Facebook-dating\n\nFirst up, Facebook makes it clear that your activity on the Dating service is limited to the Dating service. In other words, anything you do won\u2019t appear on your primary Facebook profile in any way.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nNobody will be able to see that you\u2019re using Facebook Dating just by looking at your Facebook profile. And Dating won\u2019t match you up with any of your Facebook friends\u2014sorry, in advance, if you were planning to use the service to finally ask out your crush.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nWho you\u2019ll see on Facebook Dating (and who can find you)\n\nWhile you can\u2019t get too granular with who might be able to find you on Facebook Dating\u2014no auto-blocking people from your high school or college, if you\u2019re stick of the same ol\u2019 pool of suitors, for example\u2014you can at least slightly restrict who you\u2019ll see as potential matches. Additionally, you can block specific users from being able to find you.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nHow Facebook Dating uses your location information\n\nFacebook\u2019s Dating service will automatically determine your location via Location Services, but the company notes that it doesn\u2019t use this feature to automatically update your location (wherever you happen to be). I\u2019m surprised\u2014pleasantly surprised.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nWho sees what on your Facebook Dating profile\n\nFacebook goes on to note exactly how the information you submit to Dating is used across the service and, once again, reiterates the great chasm between your Dating profile and your regular Facebook profile. You can also check out the Dating service\u2019s terms and conditions, which basically say that Facebook isn\u2019t responsible for anything horrible that happens to you on a date.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nHow to pick the information that appears on your Dating profile\n\nFinally, Facebook will give you a prompt\u2014it can create a profile for you, based on photos and information it extracts from your existing Facebook profile (I guess the chasm isn\u2019t that wide between the two services)\u2014or you can set up a profile manually. I recommend the latter approach, because that gives you the most control over the data and information you\u2019re sharing.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nAs part of the process, you\u2019ll be asked to describe yourself in sentences, words or emoji; add some photos; and answer some pre-built questions such as, \u201cThe song that always gets me on the dance floor is...\u201d (Ginuwine\u2019s Pony, in case you were curious.) You\u2019ll also be able to add some of your basic information, like height, job, number of kids religious views, etc.\n\nThe privacy options worth knowing once you\u2019re ready to date\n\nNow that you\u2019re actually in the main part of the app, there are two sections you should investigate before you start your big search for love.\n\nFacebook friends can find you if you are both a \u201cSecret Crush\u201d\n\nFirst, there\u2019s Facebook Dating\u2019s \u201cSecret Crush\u201d feature. Tap the \u201cAdd Secret Crush\u201d button, and you\u2019ll be able to pick up to nine Facebook friends that you have the hots for. They won\u2019t know about your crush unless they pick you as their \u201cSecret Crush,\u201d too.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nIn other words, using this feature will open up your Dating profile to your Facebook friends\u2014and it appears to be the only way that they would ever directly see you on the Dating service, but only if they have the hots for you.\n\nHow to take a time-out or delete your Dating profile completely\n\nWhether you pick a Secret Crush or not, you\u2019ll definitely want to make a quick stop in the Dating service\u2019s settings, found by tapping on the gear icon and tapping the \u201cGeneral\u201d tab. Here, you\u2019ll be able to set whether you want to receive notifications about new likes or messages (you probably do), you\u2019ll get to revisit the privacy settings from earlier and, most importantly, you\u2019ll be able to \u201cTake a Break\u201d from Dating if you\u2019re getting tired (or have found the one).\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nFinally, you\u2019ll also be able to delete your entire Dating profile. Tap the button, tap \u201cDelete Profile\u201d again, and all your conversations and photos will join your profile in a great digital trash can.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nHow to limit who else can see you\u2019re into dating within events and groups\n\nEventually, you\u2019ll be able to also see who is using Facebook\u2019s Dating service among the people attending events you\u2019re interested in (or groups you\u2019re a member of). As Facebook notes, the only way to keep others from seeing you in groups or events is to not look for them yourself:\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nHow to stay safe when you\u2019re on an actual date\n\nEventually, notes Facebook, you\u2019ll also be able to let your real friends know if (or when) you go on a date\u2014an incredibly useful way to help ensure your safety and one time when we wouldn\u2019t mind giving up our real-time location in the slightest.\n\n\u201cPeople using Facebook Dating can share details of their upcoming date and/or live location with someone they trust via Messenger. They will be able to control if they want to choose this feature. If they do, they are in control of who they share this information with.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t try this out myself, since I don\u2019t have any dates at the moment (tear), but there\u2019s no reason why you shouldn\u2019t give it a shot. It beats the ol\u2019, \u201cI\u2019m calling the police if you aren\u2019t home by 10\" approach from your roommate (or parents).", "description": "Gone are the days of poking people on Facebook that you wanted to poke in real life.
