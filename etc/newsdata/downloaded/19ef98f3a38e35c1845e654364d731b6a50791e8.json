Australia's dollar AUD=D4 had tumbled overnight after its\n\ncentral bank cut interest rates in its trade war-hit economy for\n\nthe third time this year. That in turn dragged the neighbouring\n\nKiwi dollar NZD=D4 to a 4-year low.\n\n\"On we go with the dollar,\" said Societe Generale strategist\n\nKit Juckes. \"It is the pick of the major economies and I don't\n\nthink anything is going to change (for the dollar) until the\n\neconomy slows.\"\n\n\"If you are very sensitive to global trade and sensitive to\n\nmanufacturing you are having a very tough time of it at the\n\nmoment, there is no doubt about it.\"\n\nThe dollar index against a basket of major currencies\n\nrose 0.2% to 99.585, its highest level since May 2017.\n\nBond markets were also grumbling after a weak auction of\n\nJapanese government debt underscored the lack of enthusiasm for\n\nthe negative interest rates that more and more countries will be\n\nheading towards if economies and inflation stay weak.\n\nThat worry fed across to higher bond yields across major\n\nmarkets, with 10-year German, French and Spanish and U.S\n\nTreasury yields all up 2 to 4 basis points. GVD/EUR\n\nEconomic surprise indexes published by Citigroup for the\n\nUnited States and Europe .CESIUSD , .CESIEUR showed an\n\nincreased divergence. The former is at its highest in nearly two\n\nyears; the latter has fallen to a 2019 low.\n\nHOT CHIPS\n\nIt wasn't all gloomy though. In Asia, the world's largest\n\ncontract chipmaker TSMC of Taiwan jumped 2.9% to hit\n\nan all-time high.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nhad inched up 0.23% while Japan's Nikkei\n\nrose 0.6% and Australia's benchmark by 0.8%, some of\n\nthat coming after the central bank rate cut.\n\nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro had also dismissed\n\nreports on Monday that the Trump administration was considering\n\ndelisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges as \"fake\n\nnews\" \"Whether it was a fake news or not, it is becoming harder to\n\nknow exactly what the U.S. administration will be doing,\" said\n\nTakashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex Securities.\n\nChina and the United States are due to resume high-level\n\ntrade talks next week in Washington.\n\nBack in the currency market, the euro traded at $1.0888\n\n, having slipped to a near 2 1/2-year low.\n\nThe yen was slightly weaker at 108.24 yen to the dollar\n\n, not far from last month's low of 108.48 too.\n\nGold also fell to a two-month low as the stronger greenback\n\ntook its toll on metals markets, It was last trading at\n\n$1,468.50 per ounce .\n\nOil prices rebounded, however, after data showed production\n\nat the world's largest oil producers fell in the third quarter.\n\nIt also came after a sizeable 8% drop over the last few months.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 1.2% on\n\nto $54.28 per barrel after falling 3.3% on Monday. Brent\n\nwas up 1% at just under $60 a barrel.\n\n\"Any rallies, though, are likely to be met with plenty of\n\nsellers as a slowing global economy and the recovery of Saudi\n\nproduction outweigh any Middle East risk factors for now,\"\n\nJeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at\n\nOANDA in Singapore, said.\n\n\n\nEconomic surprise indexes https://tmsnrt.rs/2nlpaij\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Dollar powers to 29-month high, stocks stay standing despite weak data", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_4_800x533_L_1413112066.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
