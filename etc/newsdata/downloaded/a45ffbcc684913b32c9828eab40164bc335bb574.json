As a biology professor at the University of Texas at Austin, Matz is well aware of the many threats corals face: global warming, pollution, ocean acidification, you name it. But when it comes to the danger posed by sunscreen chemicals \u2014 some of which are now banned in certain states and countries after research found they could bleach coral in the lab \u2014 Matz just isn\u2019t convinced.\n\nHe\u2019s tried to induce bleaching in corals, a reaction in which corals expel algae, a main food source, and usually die, in every which way possible. He\u2019s even filled a tub of corals with sunscreen until the water was milky white with the substance. Matz told Gizmodo the corals he tested were fine. In fact, they were \u201chappy,\u201d he said, with their tentacles out and feeding.\n\n\u201cSunscreen is not a problem,\u201d Matz said. \u201cActually, you can kill corals much more efficiently if you pee on them,\u201d he joked.\n\nHis attitude highlights a point of contention among coral scientists. On the one hand, research drawing links between certain ultraviolet-filtering chemicals \u2014 particularly oxybenzone and octinoxate \u2014 is still just a few years old. On the other hand, the state of the world\u2019s corals is dire, and any threat to these ecosystems should be taken seriously.\n\nJust Friday, Australia reduced the health status of the Great Barrier Reef to the lowest status because it\u2019s doing so poorly.\n\nSummer\u2019s coming to an end in the U.S., but the weather\u2019s still ripe for a beach trip in many areas. Perhaps you\u2019re planning a winter getaway to an island paradise. If you\u2019re heading to Hawaii or the U.S. Virgin Islands, your favourite sunscreen may be illegal by 2021 and March 2020, respectively. However, the issue isn\u2019t settled, and some, like Matz, worry the sunscreen debate distracts us from some of the more severe threats to corals.\n\n\u201cThe scientific community does not believe it,\u201d Matz told Gizmodo.\n\nExcept, well, many in the science community do. Craig Downs, the executive director of the Haereticus Environmental Laboratory, published some of the first literature on the topic back in 2016. His study, which was peer-reviewed and supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), determined that oxybenzone and benzophenone-2, another chemical that can be found in sunscreen, induced bleaching in coral larvae.\n\nThis was all, of course, in a lab setting, because who\u2019s going to pour sunscreen onto a wild coral reef? Since that paper, Downs has heard from thousands of people who want to learn more about the topic, he told Gizmodo.\n\n\u201cThe science in that study was the tip of the iceberg,\u201d he wrote to Gizmodo in an email.\n\nPhoto: AP\n\nCheryl Woodley, a research scientist with NOAA\u2019s National Centres for Coastal Ocean Science, worked on that study with Downs. She said the impacts they witnessed aren\u2019t exclusive to corals: Macroalgae, fish, and invertebrates also suffered when exposed to the ultraviolet filters in sunscreens.\n\nShe\u2019s been reviewing the literature on the topic and said she\u2019s identified some 500 recent papers that show the way these ingredients impact living things.\n\nEven the supposedly safer mineral filters, titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, have been linked to harming corals (despite many sunscreen companies dubbing them \u201creef safe,\u201d a label that requires no regulation or oversight).\n\n\u201cMy role is to provide science-based information to managers, to decision-makers, and it\u2019s their role to decide if it\u2019s enough or not ,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are some that have decided it\u2019s not enough. There are others \u2014 with the body of information based in the science \u2014 that have felt like in the protection of their resources and their communities, this is the decision they need to make.\u201d\n\nSince their research, a number of studies and reviews have come out on the specific topic of corals and sunscreen bans. The more research, the better informed these decision-makers can be. But as Abigail Renegar, a corals research at Nova Southeastern University, told Gizmodo, there\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know. These experiments look at different coral species and different chemicals.\n\nThey use different methodologies and ways of measuring the concentration of the chemicals in the water. The way sunscreen from the bodies of swimmers might affect corals in the real world is, to put it simply, hard to study, Renegar said.\n\n\u201cAll of these experiments have some degree of variability in the methods,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it makes understanding what the actual effects are very, very difficult to interpret.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s remained consistent, however, is the negative reaction from corals to oxybenzone, the main target of these bans. Despite Renegar\u2019s critical eye to these studies, she believes there\u2019s enough out there to warrant the bans. If corals suffer under short-term exposure, she can only imagine what this long-term exposure to low levels of these chemicals may mean for the corals.\n\n\u201cA lot of researchers that I really respect have done a lot of this research, and it is something that we can do something about ,\u201d she told Gizmodo. \u201cThe political will exists right now to do something about that.\u201d\n\nConcerned beachgoers may opt to minimise the amount of sunscreen they use by wearing long-sleeve rash guards and other sun-protective clothing. It\u2019s important not to skimp on sun protection altogether, though: Unlike with corals and sunscreen, the science is settled when it comes to sunburns causing skin cancer.\n\nThe real threat to corals \u2014 no matter your stance on sunscreen \u2014 is global warming. What the corals need is for us to get our shit together. Sunscreen bans won\u2019t help corals if they\u2019re boiling underwater.", "description": "Mikhail Matz loves corals.
