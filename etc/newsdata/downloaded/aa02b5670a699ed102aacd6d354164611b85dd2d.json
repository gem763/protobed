The formal draft instead relies on National Security Council (NSC) staff who are listening in and taking notes.\n\n\u201cTranscript\u201d wrong word to describe White House record of @realDonaldTrump call with Ukraine president. Traditionally such conversations are not recorded. What you tend to have is a memo prepared by a NSC staffer listening in that captures what he/she believes are main points. \u2014 Richard N. Haass (@RichardHaass) September 25, 2019\n\nSo what did the Ukraine phone summary say and what's behind the process of keeping a record of presidential calls with world leaders?\n\nWhat's in the Trump-Zelensky summary?\n\nThe 30-minute call was in fact reduced to a five-page summary released by the Trump administration. Throughout the call, Trump repeatedly urges Zelensky to re-open an investigation into an energy firm for which Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, sat on the board of directors. He references Biden when inquiring about a renewed probe.\n\nA footnote at the bottom of the released document on Wednesday cautioned the transcript was not verbatim and instead includes \"the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and [National Security Council] staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place.\"\n\nA number of factors, the document warns, can affect the transcript's accuracy including a poor connection, accents of those participating in the call or interpretation of their comments.\n\nCall summary: Trump releases details of call with Zelensky amid impeachment inquiry\n\nWhat they said: Read the summary of Trump's controversial call\n\nThroughout the document, the word \"inaudible\" is used to indicate a notetaker had difficulty recording exact wording.\n\nAt one point, Trump again asks Zelensky to do a \"favor\" for the U.S.: \"If you can look into it ... it sounds horrible to me.\"\n\nOfficials could not explain the ellipsis, saying only that they are used when the conversation is inaudible and not picked up by voice recognition software.\n\nHow is a presidential call made?\n\nMikes Green, a former senior NSC official under former president George W. Bush, said the so-called transcripts are not a stenographer's detailed notes which are legally valid and can be used in court.\n\n\"It's meant to be a record of conversation going forward for policy purposes,\" Green said.\n\nIn this Jan. 28, 2017, file photo, U.S. President Donald Trump speaks on the phone with Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. More\n\nHe said the process begins with NSC staff, who prepare a briefing memo for the president that includes biographical information about the leader and talking points, organized by subject, to mention in conversation.\n\nUnder Bush, whom Green served, as well his father George H.W. Bush, these memos typically consisted of 2\u00bd pages of notes. Bush tended to read the memo the night before, taking a Sharpie to sections he wanted to remove and adding in his own thoughts.\n\nEvan Medeiros, a former senior NSC official for Obama, said the former president read the talking points in about 90% of the phone calls he sat in on.", "description": "Trump released a summary of his call with Ukraine's president, but former NSC staff say transcripts are not verbatim.
