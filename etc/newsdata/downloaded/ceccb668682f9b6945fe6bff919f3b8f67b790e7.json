It\u2019s about Trump\u2019s tax returns.", "language": "en", "text": "Columnist\n\nHey, have you heard about this whistleblower complaint?\n\nAn unnamed civil servant is alleging serious interference in government business. If the allegations are true, they could be a game-changer. They might set in motion the release of lots of other secret documents showing that President Trump has abused his authority for his personal benefit.\n\nWait, you thought I meant the whistleblower from the intelligence community?\n\nNope. I\u2019m talking about a completely different whistleblower, whose claims have gotten significantly less attention but could prove no less consequential. This whistleblower alleges a whole different category of impropriety: that someone has been secretly meddling with the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s audit of the president.\n\nIn defiance of a half-century norm, Trump has kept his tax returns secret.\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly what he might be hiding. His bizarre behavior, though, suggests it\u2019s really bad.\n\nMaybe these documents would reveal something embarrassing but not criminal (e.g., the relatively puny size of his fortune). Maybe they\u2019d reveal that some of his financial dealings are legally dubious or even fraudulent, which would be consistent with past Trump-family tax behavior.\n\nMost significantly, they might reveal that Trump has been profiting off the presidency. Among the relevant conflict-of-interest questions that Trump\u2019s taxes could answer: whom he gets money from, whom he owes money to (and on what terms) or how his 2017 tax overhaul enriched him personally.\n\nNot that you\u2019d know it from the administration\u2019s stonewalling, but Congress actually has unambiguous authority to get Trump\u2019s returns. In fact, it has had the authority to get any federal tax return, no questions asked, for nearly a century. Under a 1924 law, Treasury \u201cshall furnish\u201d any tax document requested by the House Ways and Means or Senate Finance Committee chairs.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what the House Ways and Means chairman, Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), did in the spring. The statute doesn\u2019t require him to state any legislative purpose for his request, but he provided one anyway: He said that committee needed to make sure the IRS, which it oversees, is properly conducting its annual audit of the president and vice president, as the IRS manual has required post-Watergate.\n\nThere is historical precedent for worrying about how rigorously the IRS might be auditing its own boss. In the early 1970s, the agency commended then- President Richard M. Nixon on his supposedly pristine tax filings, even though he owed about a half-million dollars in unpaid taxes and interest.\n\nSince then, presidents have voluntarily released their tax returns. So Congress didn\u2019t really need to worry much about whether the IRS was going easy on the president.\n\n\u201cThe concern about the IRS\u2019s audit is almost minimal or nonexistent if tax returns are public, because there are effectively a million auditors,\u201d says George K. Yin, University of Virginia School of Law professor emeritus and former chief of staff of Congress\u2019s Joint Committee on Taxation. \u201cThe public can see if there\u2019s any funny business going on.\u201d\n\nCurrent circumstances are different, of course.\n\nStill, from an optics standpoint, this IRS-audit-oversight rationale seemed a strange one for Neal to cite. Especially because it was the primary rationale offered, and there was no reason at the time to believe the IRS was actually being bullied. So, for the first time in history, the administration refused a Ways and Means tax request, on the grounds that Neal\u2019s stated legislative purpose was \u201cpretextual.\u201d\n\nBut now, in retrospect, Neal\u2019s stated purpose looks either extremely ingenious \u2014 or extremely lucky.\n\nThat\u2019s because this summer an anonymous whistleblower approached the House committee to say its concerns had been justified. The whistleblower offered credible allegations of \u201cevidence of possible misconduct,\u201d specifically \u201cinappropriate efforts to influence\u201d the audit of the president, according to a letter Neal sent to the treasury secretary.\n\nWe don\u2019t know the complaint details, including who allegedly meddled with the audit or how, and whether the IRS complied. The complaint hasn\u2019t been released, and Neal said last week that he\u2019s still consulting with congressional lawyers about whether to make it public.\n\nBut the exact details of the allegations matter less than the fact that they corroborate Democratic lawmakers\u2019 argument that oversight of the IRS\u2019s annual presidential audit is indeed a legitimate reason they \u2014 and hopefully, eventually, the public \u2014 should see Trump\u2019s taxes. It\u2019s hard to imagine how the federal judge in this case could now rule against the committee.\n\nAs is so often true with allegations of Trumpian wrongdoing, we\u2019ve learned once again that there\u2019s a there there \u2014 and there, and there, and all sorts of other places you mightn\u2019t have thought to look.", "description": "This is a whole different category of alleged impropriety.", "authors": ["Catherine Rampell", "Columnist Covering Economics", "Public Policy", "Politics", "September At Pm", "Catherine Rampell Is An Opinion Columnist At The Washington Post.
