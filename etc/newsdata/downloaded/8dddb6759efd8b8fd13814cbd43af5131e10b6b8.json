The final six needed to retake the majority will be harder to find, he says. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo 2020 elections Ominous signs could sink Republicans\u2019 chances of retaking the House House Republicans head to an annual retreat Thursday with few wins.\n\nA parade of Republican retirements. Red flags about the economy. President Donald Trump\u2019s approval ratings under water. A nail-biter race in a GOP stronghold.\n\nHouse Republicans are grappling with a string of ominous warning signs from over the past month that could spell doom for the party\u2019s chances of clawing back power in 2020, an unsettling prospect for the GOP conference as it prepares for its annual retreat in Baltimore on Thursday.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnd while Tuesday\u2019s narrow victory in a North Carolina special election provided a sorely needed bright spot for the party, the big picture for Republicans remains dim. Even some of Trump\u2019s top allies on Capitol Hill recognize that it\u2019s going to be an uphill climb in flipping the 18 seats they need to win back the House.\n\n\u201cI see an easy path for 12 pickup seats. It\u2019s the last six that will be tough, and that actually runs through California,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. \u201cIf we don\u2019t pick up any in California, it will be virtually impossible.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump gathers with House Republicans for their three-day retreat, the party will at least have a fresh pair of victories to rally around: Republican Dan Bishop narrowly beat out Democrat Dan McCready on Tuesday to represent North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District, a race that was widely seen as a test case for 2020. Bishop benefited from a swell of GOP support among rural voters, suggesting Trump\u2019s appeal is still strong with a central pillar of his base.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nMeanwhile, the GOP\u2019s Greg Murphy easily won a separate special election to fill an open seat in the Tar Heel State.\n\nTrump \u2014 who performed an eleventh-hour rescue mission for Bishop and held a rally for him in North Carolina on Monday night \u2014 may be especially fired up when he addresses Republicans at the retreat. Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are also slated to address Republicans during the annual gathering.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, it would have really put a damper on [the retreat]\u201d if Bishop had lost, said retiring Rep. Susan Brooks (R-Ind.), who leads recruitment efforts for the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm. \u201cBut it was big to win.\u201d\n\nBeneath the surface, however, there are a host of reasons for Republicans to be rattled by Bishop\u2019s 2-point victory. The GOP had to go all-out to save the seat in a district that Trump won by 12 points in 2016 and which has been in Republican hands since the 1960s. And Bishop performed poorly in the suburbs, a key battleground where voters fled the GOP last year.\n\nEven more ominous for the party: There are 35 GOP-held House seats that are even less Republican than North Carolina\u2019s 9th District, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\n\n\u201cThis is like a five-alarm fire for Republicans in prosperous suburbs,\u201d Dave Wasserman, House editor for the Cook Political Report, said in an interview. \u201c[The GOP] averted disaster, but there\u2019s nothing in the results to persuade House Republicans who are sitting on the fence about running for reelection that they are any likelier to take back the majority.\u201d\n\nA mix of veteran and vulnerable Republicans have called it quits in recent weeks, a sign that GOP lawmakers may be growing less confident about their chances of seizing back the House next year. Some Republicans \u2014 two-thirds of whom have never served in the minority \u2014 would rather call it quits than continue to roam the political wilderness.\n\nSeveral of the retirements have been especially devastating for the GOP. The party is losing Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, a rising young star and the only black Republican in the House; Rep. Martha Roby of Alabama and Brooks, two of the GOP\u2019s 13 female lawmakers; and longtime Rep. John Shimkus of Illinois, who is roommates with Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.).\n\nMost of the retirements thus far are in ruby-red districts, which Republicans will have no problems keeping. But at least three of the races have become more competitive in the wake of the retirement announcements, and more endangered members could jump ship if they don\u2019t want to duke it out another term \u2014 especially if the GOP\u2019s prospects look bleak in 2020.\n\nGOP leadership, however, has downplayed the recent wave of retirements and maintains they are in a strong position to flip the House.\n\n\u201cWe consistently have a lot more turnover than the Democrats, and that\u2019s been the case when we\u2019re in the majority or the minority,\u201d said Scalise. \u201cWe have a real opportunity to win the majority back.\u201d\n\nRep. Steve Scalise. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\n\nOne key factor that could influence races up and down the ballot next year, lawmakers say, is the strength of the economy. The GOP is banking on strong economic growth and low unemployment rates to serve as their calling card in 2020.\n\nBut Trump has thrown that strategy into question. The president escalated his trade war last month, slapping a new round of tariffs on China that directly hit consumers for the first time \u2014 though on Wednesday he announced he would delay imposing an additional 5 percent duty on about $250 billion of goods from China. And there have also been signs of a possible economic recession, including a shrink in the manufacturing sector and the so-called inverted yield curve.\n\nIf the economy falters, it could pose a real problem for the GOP\u2019s electoral map. Moderate and independent voters who do back Trump, especially in the suburbs, might be less willing to look past the president\u2019s divisive rhetoric \u2014 which, this summer, included racist attacks on four female lawmakers of color.\n\n\u201cThe stronger the economy, the better it will be for the president and Republicans,\u201d said GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York. \u201cIf the economy is not going well, I guess it depends on how so, which factors of the economy aren\u2019t going well.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t foresee the economy going in that kind of a wrong direction between now and next fall,\u201d Zeldin added.\n\nBut the public doesn\u2019t seem to have as much confidence in the economy. Six in 10 Americans think a recession is likely in the next year, according to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll. Trump is also lagging behind his top 2020 Democratic rivals, while his approval ratings have dipped 6 points, down to 38 percent, according to the same survey.\n\n\u201cIn both 2018 and last night, House race results have been highly correlated with Trump\u2019s approval ratings,\u201d Wasserman said. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that [Republicans] win back control of the House either way. Right now, I would put the chances at somewhere between 25 and 35 percent.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, however, are holding out hope. They think Democrats could actually rev up Trump\u2019s base if they wind up launching impeachment proceedings or nominate a far-left presidential candidate, which could have down-ballot benefits for the GOP.\n\n\u201cObviously there are some worries out there, between the slowing global economy and the trade wars,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.). \u201cBut I think by and large, our members are in a good mood and ready to fight.\u201d\n\n", "description": "House Republicans head to an annual retreat Thursday with few wins.", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/52/2f/2cbab5de477685c7f7a47a4d7e9e/190911-mark-meadows-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
