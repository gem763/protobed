So far it has been resisted but, if agreed, it would have to be implemented at Premier League academies.\n\nBournemouth have already taken the matter into their own hands and stopped heading for the youngest players in their academy, while the Scottish Football Association is considering reducing heading in youth football.\n\nAlthough there is a debate over which age groups should be covered, including whether it should go up to under-18s, there is a sense that a ban could quickly be implemented for children up to the age of 12.\n\nThe Premier League emailed the 20 clubs soon after the publication of the report to inform them it was examining the evidence and will make recommendations. It appears it will focus specifically on whether children should continue to be allowed to head a ball.", "description": "The Premier League has written to all 20 clubs to notify them it is considering what action needs to be taken following the publication of a landmark report confirming the link between dementia and football.", "authors": ["Jason Burt", "Chief Football Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/30/TELEMMGLPICT000214641889-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7EbRN9QD0CUclNfacQETPj4.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
