House Speaker Nancy Pelosi started impeachment proceedings before reading the underlying evidence. Democrats previously talked with Ukrainians in the 2016 election. House Intelligence Committee chair Adam B. Schiff dramatized the phone call with made up words in the voice of a mob boss. The \u201cdeep state\u201d is attempting a coup. Democrats, by contrast, benefit from message discipline. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple,\u201d Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) says on MSNBC. \u201cThe president compromised our national security by seeking political dirt on his rival from a foreign leader.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n9:05 a.m. Fox News\u2019 news programming gets going with a golf course photo acquired by Tucker Carlson, the network\u2019s prime time opinion host. The image shows Joe and Hunter Biden, the younger Biden\u2019s longtime business partner Devon Archer and another unidentified man. They stand with their clubs on a putting green. The chyron says \u201cJoe, Hunter Biden pictured golfing with Ukraine gas company exec in 2014.\u201d That\u2019s a reference to Archer, an American who joined the board of a Ukrainian gas company with Hunter Biden. Counting the younger Biden, there are two Ukraine gas company executives in the frame.\n\n9:19 a.m. Trump continues to battle his own political appointees. \u201cSo if the so-called \u2018Whistleblower\u2019 has all second hand information, and almost everything he has said about my \u2018perfect\u2019 call with the Ukrainian President is wrong (much to the embarrassment of Pelosi & Schiff), why aren\u2019t we entitled to interview & learn everything about the Whistleblower,\u201d Trump tweets. His acting director of national intelligence announced last week that he is \u201ccommitted to protecting whistleblowers.\u201d The Intelligence Community Inspector General put out a statement Monday night saying the whistleblower had \u201cdirect knowledge of certain alleged conduct.\u201d Both have praised the whistleblower\u2019s professionalism, and there is no public evidence that almost all of what the whistleblower said was wrong.\n\n11:07 a.m. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) pushes back on Trump\u2019s efforts to out the whistleblower\u2019s identity. \u201cThis person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected. We should always work to respect whistleblowers\u2019 requests for confidentiality,\u201d he writes. Grassley does not mention Trump, but he does say there is no legal distinction between a whistleblower with first- and secondhand information.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n11:30 a.m. A Monmouth University poll taken last week finds little movement in Trump approval, which sits at 41 percent compared with 40 percent in August. Support for his impeachment and removal is at 44 percent, which is not far from where the number was in March of 2019 (42 percent) and July of 2017 (41 percent). The poll also compares Trump\u2019s numbers to President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s numbers before he left office. Nixon\u2019s job approval, as recorded by Gallup, dropped from 44 percent in June of 1973 to 25 percent in April of 1974. Support for impeaching and removing Nixon rose from 19 percent to 46 percent over the same period.\n\n11:40 a.m. The Washington Post posts a letter Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sent today to House Democrats denying their request to depose promptly five current and former officials. He calls the requests an effort \u201cto intimidate, bully, and treat improperly\u201d State Department officials. \u201cI will not tolerate such tactics,\u201d Pompeo writes. He offers a number of legal and procedural reasons to argue the request is improper. The letter also appears to contain a warning to the officials not to produce requested documents for the House, saying such production \u201ccould potentially constitute a violation of numerous civil and criminal statues and regulations.\u201d The requested officials include Marie Yovanovitch, who was recently recalled as ambassador to Ukraine, and Kurt Volker, who resigned last week as the Trump administration\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine. Pompeo\u2019s State Department, meantime, is investigating the email records of dozens of current and former department officials who sent messages to Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email years ago, according to letters reviewed by The Post.\n\n12:22 p.m. Sebastian Gorka, a former White House deputy assistant turned talk radio host, posts a video on Twitter from an outdoor cafe in Rome. He confirms reports that he recently traveled with Pompeo to Italy, which he describes as part of an effort to investigate the Obama Administration, presumably in relation to a broader Justice Department look at the 2016 election. \u201cThe house of cards that is Obamagate is collapsing. The crimes of the last administration are being uncovered, and people are running scared,\u201d Gorka says. Then he announces he will smoke a cigar and drink a cafe affogato, which is vanilla gelato drowned in espresso. He does not lack theatricality, but he does misspell his website address in the tweet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n12:24 p.m. Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) announces he is drafting legislation to ban immediate family members of Senators, members of Congress, the president or the vice president from working for \u201cany entity doing business in or with Ukraine.\u201d This is an indirect shot at Hunter Biden, whose father is no longer vice president and who no longer works for a Ukrainian company. \u201cThe best way to resist temptation is a proper upbringing, a strong set of values and tough laws,\u201d Kennedy says in a news release.\n\n1:01 p.m. Bloomberg reports that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has told reporters in Kiev he never met or spoke by phone with Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani. \u201cI want to tell you that I never feel any pressure and there are very many people in the west and in Ukraine who would like to influence me,\u201d he said. He also said the text of his conversation with Trump released by the White House is similar to Ukrainian records. \u201cI spoke Ukrainian, and President Trump unfortunately did not speak Ukrainian, he spoke English,\u201d Zelensky said.\n\n1:17 p.m. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the chair of the House Financial Services Committee, breaks from Democratic message discipline and launches a Twitter rant against the president and his advisers. She calls Attorney General William P. Barr \u201cTrump\u2019s puppet, \u201d accuses Trump of \u201cdog whistling to his white supremacists\u201d and calls the president \u201ca dishonorable con man.\u201d \u201cImpeachment is not good enough for Trump,\u201d she tweets. \u201cHe needs to be imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement. But for now, impeachment is the imperative.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n2:23 p.m. House Democratic leaders of the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees respond to Pompeo\u2019s letter with a news release. \u201cHe should immediately cease intimidating Department witnesses to protect himself and the President,\u201d they write. \u201cAny effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from talking with Congress \u2014 including State Department employees \u2014 is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\n2:24 p.m. Partisan views of the Justice Department have flipped under Trump. Pew Research Center releases a September poll that finds 61 percent of Republicans say they view the department favorably, up from 47 percent in 2017 when Trump took office. Among Democrats, 49 percent now approve, down from 74 percent in 2017.\n\n2:52 p.m. Giuliani keeps up the media persecution messaging. He alleges via tweet that The Post, NBC News and CNN are \u201cgoing after me because I\u2019m the messenger, and covering up the message, Dem corruption.\u201d He says Biden \u201cis protected and immune like the Clintons and crooked Clinton foundation!\u201d It is not clear what stories he is referring to. The Post reported last week that Giuliani was set to be paid to attend Kremlin-backed conference in Armenia. He canceled his appearance after the story published.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n4:46 p.m. A House committee official announces that Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, will appear before the House on Thursday and that Yovanovitch, the former ambassador, will appear on Oct. 11. This comes just hours after the letter from Pompeo promising to fight their deposition before the House.\n\n5 p.m. State Department Inspector General Steve Linick has requested a meeting with key committees on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, The Post reports. Linick\u2019s office said in a letter to Congress on Tuesday that it had \u201cobtained the documents from the acting legal adviser of the Department of State.\u201d Linick said the purpose of the meeting is \u201cto discuss and provide staff with copies of documents related to the State Department and Ukraine.\u201d It is not clear what the documents contain.\n\nAD", "description": "Intimations of a \u201ccoup,\u201d Trump\u2019s persistent war against the whistleblower, and House Democrats and the Secretary of State do battle over testimony.", "authors": ["Michael Scherer", "National Political Reporter Covering Campaigns", "Congress", "The White House"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/b0D2--j00rSkMi57lTgAZMGNdQc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/37WCEAXESQI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
