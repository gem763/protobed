The emails, texts, tweets and a video directed his supporters to a new Republican portal designed to capi\u00adtal\u00adize on Trump\u2019s army of online donors.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats thrive on silencing and intimidating his supporters, like YOU, Friend. They want to take YOUR VOTE away,\u201d read an email to supporters Tuesday afternoon. \u201cPresident Trump wants to know who stood with him when it mattered most.\u201d\n\nSuch appeals \u2014 often capitalizing on newsworthy moments for the president \u2014 have been a mainstay of Trump\u2019s fundraising strategy and have fueled his reelection effort.\n\nWith the help of small-dollar donors angered by the sense that the president is being treated unfairly, Trump's reelection effort has amassed a record-breaking war chest, turning political attacks against the president into peak fundraising moments.\n\nTrump\u2019s ability to tap into his online donors has reshaped the donor base for the Republican Party, which has historically leaned on wealthy donors, and raised the stakes for Democratic presidential candidates to show they can cultivate their own small-dollar base to compete with Trump\u2019s.\n\nGOP officials have said the committees raising money for Trump\u2019s reelection have drawn more money from digital fundraising appeals in the second quarter of 2019 than they did over the entire first half of 2018 \u2014 highlighting his ability to draw and sustain support from donors giving less than $200.\n\n[Trump and RNC report raising record $105 million in second quarter of 2019]\n\nThe appeals on Tuesday called on his supporters to join an \u201cOfficial Impeachment Defense Task Force\u201d made up of \u201conly President Trump\u2019s most LOYAL supporters,\u201d with suggested donations ranging from $5 to the maximum $2,800, or $45 to show support for the 45th president.\n\n\u201cNancy just called for Impeachment. WITCH HUNT! I need you on my Impeachment Defense Team,\u201d read a text message sent to supporters shortly after Pelosi\u2019s announcement. The message was \u201csigned\u201d by Trump.\n\nThe impeachment-themed donations were directed to multiple committees: his reelection campaign committee, a committee raising money for his reelection and the Republican National Committee, and a fund aimed at unseating a freshman Democrat elected to the seat in 2018 in a district that had voted for Trump in 2016.\n\nParty officials tweeted on Tuesday that the fund set up to help the eventual nominee for the seat in Michigan had raised more than $100,000 in the first hour.\n\nSlotkin has repeatedly said the people of her district don\u2019t support impeachment. Since she is clearly not working for MI08, @realDonaldTrump\u2019s campaign & @GOP are raising $ for a nominee fund to defeat her on @winred. Over 100k in the first hour.

Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) \u2014 also sent impeachment-themed solicitations Tuesday to their supporters.\n\n\u201cFolks, Trump is afraid of facing Joe next fall, and he keeps lashing out,\u201d read a Biden campaign text to supporters Tuesday. \u201cUse this link to chip in now to defend Joe Biden,\u201d it continued, carrying a link to his campaign donation page.", "description": "As the House on Tuesday announced a formal inquiry, Trump\u2019s reelection committees turned to his loyal base of online donors.", "authors": ["Michelle Ye Hee Lee", "National Political Enterprise", "Accountability Reporter Covering Money", "Influence In Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/oBrWuNZKjk7yr7n0CpmQnEoIdkg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O54YH2G7HQI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
