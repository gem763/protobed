Other Arctic birds like the rock ptarmigan and lapland longspur; and boreal species such as the boreal chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch and white-throated sparrow will be especially affected.\n\nArctic birds like the snowy owl will have nowhere to go as warmer temperatures shift northward, the study predicts.

It used climate models from the International Governmental Panel on Climate Change to predict how those habitats will shift under different warming scenarios. They categorized birds based on how much range they lost or gained as a result. Some of the results, on grassland birds, were published in a peer-reviewed journal earlier this year, and others have been presented at conferences. The full results have been submitted to journals and undergoing peer review.\n\nThe researchers found that a small number of species that aren't choosy about their habitats, such as the American crow, northern mockingbird, red-tailed hawk, mourning dove are expected to grow their ranges.\n\nBut most other species are expected to either see their ranges stay the same, or shrink.\n\n\"That means they're going to shrink overall population size,\" Wells said, \"and that makes them then more vulnerable to other factors \u2026 that can make them more at risk of decline and potentially extinction.\"\n\nBecause some of their habitats will fragment as the climate changes, Wells says conservation that preserves natural corridors that allow birds to move to new locations are key to their adaptation and survival under climate change.\n\nThe study predicts that 389 of 604 North American bird species will see a net loss their range if global temperatures rise 3 C above average temperatures in pre-industrial times. (Shirley Donald/Audubon Photography Awards)\n\nThe study also suggests that Canada will become home to more and more species of \"climate refugees\" from the south, especially in the taiga and tundra regions and, to a lesser extent the forests along the Rockies, but they too will need natural corridors to move north.\n\n\"Habitat conservation is going to be key,\" Wells said, \"both for the new ones arriving and ones that are there now trying to survive.\"\n\nThe study was funded by the MacArthur Foundation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nBetter-case scenario?\n\nBrian McGill is an ecologist at the University of Maine who studies methods for predicting how species ranges will respond to climate change, but was not involved in the Audubon study.\n\nHe said his research has found the method used in this study can give approximate trends for future ranges, but isn't very precise. He added that the calculations used in this particular study likely underestimate birds ability to adapt and move as the climate shifts, and may therefore underestimate their gains in range compared to the losses.His own research modelling individual species finds that they tend to shift their ranges with climate change, but rarely gain or lose much.\n\nHe acknowledged that the Arctic may be an exception.\n\nBut he doesn't think the situation is as dire for species in the rest of North America as the study implies: \"The link from response to climate change to extinction is scientifically a big leap.\"\n\nOne thing the study does highlight, though, is that climate change will likely transform what plants and animals you see out your window at a given location \u2014 and that doesn't just apply to birds, but other plants and animals, he added.\n\n\"Species are going to be shifting their ranges drastically. That may not be quite the loss change that they're predicting, but it's still a big change.\"", "description": "Two-thirds of North America's birds or hundreds of species \u2014 including almost all of Canada's Arctic and boreal birds \u2014 will be squeezed by shrinking habitats, putting some at risk of extinction, if climate change continues at its current pace, a new report predicts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5316491.1570728100!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/red-breasted-nuthatch.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
