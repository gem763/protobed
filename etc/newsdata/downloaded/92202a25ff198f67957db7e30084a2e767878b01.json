Every time she would sneeze, cough, run, or lift something heavy, she says she would \"leak.\"\n\n\"I kept thinking maybe this is in my head. Maybe this is my way, my body's way of reacting to birth,\" she said.\n\n\"Or maybe I'm thinking too much about it or maybe it will get better, or maybe it won't.\"\n\nIt didn't. At least, not on its own.\n\nMcGinn was suffering from pelvic floor issues brought on by pregnancy and childbirth \u2060\u2014 an extremely common medical issue that women's health advocates say doesn't get enough attention.\n\nShe says she wrestled with the decision to speak openly about it,\n\n\"There is still a taboo that exists about pelvic floor health, and talking about things like incontinence and pain during sex,\" McGinn said.\n\n\"These are such normal things for so many women after giving birth.\"\n\nWhat is the pelvic floor?\n\nThe pelvic floor is the muscle group that fills the hole at the bottom of the pelvis. It contains the genitals, and acts as a hammock that holds up organs such as the bladder, uterus and rectum.\n\nIt's a part of the body many people don't think about, or maybe even know exists, until it starts not doing its job.\n\nWhat is the pelvic floor? 1:29\n\nWhen the muscles become too weak or stretched, patients can suffer from urinary or fecal incontinence or a condition known as organ prolapse, when the organs held up by the pelvic floor drop, sometimes to the point of bulging out of the vagina.\n\nAbout a quarter of all women are affected by pelvic floor disorders, according to a 2008 study published Journal of the American Medical Association\n\nThe main risk factor is pregnancy.\n\nPut on the 'back burner'\n\nFor McGinn, it meant that every time she stood up after going to the bathroom, she felt a surge of urine discharge involuntarily.\n\nAfter months of pushing the problem to the \"back burner,\" she says she consulted a physiotherapist specializing in perineal and pelvic floor rehab.\n\nAfter about a handful of sessions, she says her problems disappeared.\n\nMcGinn says she wants all women to have access to physiotherapy and better information about pelvic floor health. (Marika Wheeler/CBC)\n\nIt was a fairly easy fix. McGinn is frustrated that there isn't more support from the medical system to help people with their pelvic floor.\n\n\"It's normal. We should be talking about this more openly,\" she said.\n\nChange the culture\n\nSarah Baribeau is trying to change that lack of support.\n\nSeven years ago, the kinesiologist opened Bougeotte et Placotine, a gym in Quebec City for pregnant people and new mothers.\n\nBaribeau says the vast majority of clients who come to her gym say they had never heard about the pelvic floor before. No one talked to them about the need to rehabilitate it after the birth of a child, be it vaginal or Cesarian.\n\nThat, she says, is a major problem.\n\nKinesiologist and gym owner Sarah Baribeau has developed special courses specifically to help people strengthen their pelvic floors during pregnancy and after birth. (Marika Wheeler/CBC)\n\nShe frequently holds lunch-and-learn conferences with physicians and health-care providers, teaching them how to speak with their patients about staying active during their pregnancies.\n\nShe provides strategies to help moms recover after birth and preventing damage to their pelvic floors.\n\nShe says she's continually surprised by how little first-line care providers know about pelvic floor health.\n\n\"I cannot believe that they don't have more information about it during their studies,\" Baribeau said.\n\n\"They know a lot of things, but they don't know anything about pelvic floor and exercise, and they are in the first row with the new moms and pregnant women.\"\n\nBaribeau holds workshops with medical professionals to explain the importance of exercise during pregnancy and talking about the pelvic floor with patients. (Marika Wheeler/CBC)\n\nNinety per cent of cases of incontinence in aging women can be improved with exercise, and 70 per cent of cases can be treated with physiotherapy, according to a study by Chantal Dumoulin , a Canada research chair in urogynecological health and aging at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.\n\nDumoulin says clinical practice guidelines indicate first-line treatment is supposed to be pelvic floor rehabilitation immediately after delivery.\n\n\"However, this is not what we find in our health-care system right now,\" she said. \"So this is really sad.\"\n\nAn expensive problem\n\nPelvic floor problems are expensive for the health-care system, Baribeau says, and for the patients as well.\n\nDepending on where patients live and what kind of insurance they have, physiotherapy is often hard to find, and can cost over a hundred dollars per session.\n\nPersistent urinary incontinence or organ prolapse is often treated with surgery, which involves attaching a mesh sling to help support the urethra, keeping it closed to prevent leaking urine \u2014 even when under pressure.\n\nIt isn't a permanent fix though. It lasts for about seven years. And it's controversial.\n\nMost cases of incontinence in aging patients can be improved with exercise says Chantal Dumoulin, a Canada research chair in urogynecological health and aging at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. (Submitted by Chantal Dumoulin)\n\nThere have been world-wide reports of serious complications linked to the devices.\n\nIn Canada and the U.S., thousands of women reported that the plastic-covered mesh eroded inside them, causing intense pelvic pain and autoimmune symptoms.\n\nIn April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned the sale and distribution of the surgical mesh.\n\nIn July, surgical mesh implants used to treat pelvic organ problems were removed from the Canadian market following a safety review by Health Canada.\n\nHealth Canada says the mesh can still be used, but only in specific patient groups, such as patients who have recurring pelvic organ prolapse or those unable to undergo other surgical treatments.\n\n'It changed my life'\n\nFor some, though, physiotherapy isn't enough to solve their problems.\n\nFollowing back-to-back pregnancies, Montreal's Nancy Benamor struggled with incontinence for nearly 16 months, despite sometimes weekly physiotherapist appointments and several kinds of treatment.\n\nAfter two back-to-back pregnancies, Nancy Benamor turned to surgery to stop her urinary incontinence. (Marika Wheeler/CBC)\n\n\"You live in fear,\" she said, describing having to always know exactly where the toilet is.\n\n\"You're choking to hold it in and then running to the bathroom to cough or sneeze on the can because you don't want to pee yourself.\"\n\nShe hit a breaking point, and despite the risks, she chose to have the surgery.\n\n\"I feel that I have my old life back,\" she said \"It's a freedom. It's liberating.\"\n\n'There should be help for us'\n\nMcGinn, meanwhile, says she felt \"ecstatic\" when she finally started to heal.\n\n\"I remember \u2026 not having incontinence and not having pain and thinking, 'Oh my goodness, I'm me again',\" she said, sitting at her kitchen table in her condo littered with children's toys, the violet smears in a small ceramic bowl all that's left of a berry crumble.\n\nShe would like to see first-line care providers talk about pelvic floor health more openly, and have physiotherapy covered by the public health-care system.\n\n\"There should be help for us,\" McGinn said, \"Women's health matters and pelvic floor is an essential part of women's health.\"\n\nWritten and produced by Marika Wheeler and Jeff Goodes.
