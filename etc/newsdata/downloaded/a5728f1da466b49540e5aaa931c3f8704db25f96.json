The TV technology that helped parents control what their children were watching on television?\n\nWell, for young people, vaping seems to be the new crack cocaine.\n\nRecall that Al Gore (who did not invent the internet) persuaded Bill Clinton to include Uncle Sam\u2019s V-chip legislation in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The measure mandated new televisions contain a V chip beginning in 2000.\n\nWhile signing the Telecommunications Act into law, Mr. Clinton promised, \u201cIf every parent uses this chip wisely, it can become a powerful voice against teen violence, teen pregnancy, teen drug use, and for both learning and entertainment,\u201d\n\nFast forward to the current generation of young people and look at Baltimore, Chicago, D.C. and other major cities where daily headlines and newscasts prove that violence upon and by the hands of young people has not abated.\n\nParenting means keeping your eyes and ears on your children, and not \u2014 I repeat not \u2014 relying on government to do your job.\n\nThe consequences should be apparent. (Get it? A-parent.)\n\nWhen parents aren\u2019t parenting, young people chug booze.\n\nWhen parents aren\u2019t parenting, young people have unprotected sex.\n\nWhen parents aren\u2019t parenting, young people skip school.\n\nWhen parents aren\u2019t parenting, young people smoke cigarettes.\n\nWhen parents aren\u2019t parenting, young people smoke crack.\n\nWhen parents aren\u2019t parenting, young people snort cocaine.\n\nWhen parents aren\u2019t parenting, young people shoot up heroin.\n\nWhen parents aren\u2019t parenting, young people use meth.\n\nWhen parents aren\u2019t parenting, young people swig cough syrup.\n\nWhen parents aren\u2019t parenting, young people smoke synthetic marijuana.\n\nWhen parents aren\u2019t parenting, young people smoke marijuana.\n\nWhen parents aren\u2019t parenting, young people vape.\n\nAnd here we are.\n\nParents are waiting for local, state and federal governments to crack down on vaping, believing that the legislation will smoke out the problem.\n\nIndeed, the theory is that young people would reject the vaping if only e-cigs weren\u2019t so tasty. In other words, prohibit the sale of bubble gum- and fruit-flavored vaping chemicals and young people will be turned off.\n\nAlong similar lines, politicians are backing bans on the sale of vaping products to young people altogether. Like that\u2019s going to make a difference.\n\nManufactures know when a good thing is a good thing \u2014 when their sales go up. If you think that\u2019s a falsehood, check out the crispy snacks young people are chowing down. They\u2019re fiery, sizzling hot, blazing hot, and left Dr. Oz wiping his teary eyes.\n\nDr. Oz is not the King of Taste Testing, but the sales of spicy snacks by adults for young people applies to vaping, too.\n\nSchools should apply no smoking rules to vaping.\n\nHere again, parents must educate themselves. For example, many parents don\u2019t even know what e-cigarettes look like. Some look like writing instruments or a watch, but transform into a vaping device.\n\nSmart manufacturers, smart young people, ignorant parents.\n\nAsk yourself: Did I buy my child a new \u201cwatch?\u201d Did she receive a \u201cwatch\u201d as a gift?\n\nWise up to the fact that young people are entertaining themselves by vaping.\n\nSo, be wiser. A parent\u2019s No. 1 job is to, well, parent.\n\n\u2981 Deborah Simmons can be contacted at [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
