Disney, Hulu and others are to follow.\n\n\"This is, of course, great for audiences. Possibly.\"\n\nThe BBC's director general will go on to say the libraries of Amazon and Netflix are \"likely to shrink, as programme-makers pull their content away from these services to place them on their own\".\n\n\"The established streamers will need to fight harder to offer the value they currently give today.\"\n\n'Unique mission'\n\nIn July, it was announced that shows like Love Island, Gavin & Stacey, Gentleman Jack and Broadchurch will be available on Britbox - their joint streaming venture with ITV - when it launches this year.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nSpeaking at the Royal Television Society convention in Cambridge, Lord Hall will argue that rather than being a threat, this \"second wave of disruption\" should act as an opportunity for the corporation, which is \"much more than all of them put together.\n\n\"In this market, services that are distinctive and different will stand out.\"\n\n\"And two vital things make us different. Firstly, we have a unique mission and purpose, all audiences - young and old - believe in it.\n\n\"Purpose and values matter today more than ever, as people pick and choose services for ethical reasons as much as economic ones.\n\n\"Secondly, no one offers the range of content, in so many genres, on so many platforms, as the BBC,\" he went on.\n\n\"We're not Netflix, we're not Spotify. We're not Apple News. We're so much more than all of them put together.\"\n\nFrom Monday, the BBC's Radio iPlayer is being phased out and users will be re-directed to the improved BBC Sounds instead. Lord Hall says BBC Sounds now has \"all the key functionality of the old iPlayerRadio\" and is being used by two million people every week.\n\nAnswering commentators who have argued that the BBC can only lose ground with younger audiences, Lord Hall noted how these online audio services are starting to turn the tide.\n\n\"In the space of a year, iPlayer's reach to young audiences is up by a third.\n\n\"There is really promising growth right across the piece. And that's before we roll out our full plans for extended availability and exclusive content.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
