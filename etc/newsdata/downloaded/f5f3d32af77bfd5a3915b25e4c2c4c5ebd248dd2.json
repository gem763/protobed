Police later removed banners and tents,\" said the journalist, who asked not to be named for security reasons.\n\n\"University students, lawyers, syndicates' officials, and activists returned to the square and many are still there despite the heavy security deployment,\" he added.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Tents caught fire, igniting a blaze, he added.\n\nKarbala\u2019s police chief has denied that any protesters had been killed and said only one person had died in an unrelated criminal incident.\n\nThe police statement claimed footage of security forces shooting at protesters was fabricated and designed to \"incite the street\" in the city.\n\nLocal governor Nassif al-Khattabi echoed the denial, calling media reports of dozens of deaths \"completely baseless\".\n\n\"The photos and videos of deaths that spread on social media websites are fabricated and part of the media campaign against the holy city,\" he said during a news conference broadcast by state-owned Iraqia News TV.\n\nThis week marked the second wave of protests this month against Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi's government, deep-seated corruption, economic stagnation and terrible public services.\n\nThe demonstrations, which have gripped areas across the country including Baghdad, Karbala and cities in the south, first erupted at the start of October.\n\nIn Baghdad\u2019s Tahrir Square local media reported that thousands of Iraqis defied a curfew which started at midnight Tuesday to go out and protest.\n\nA teacher in the well-known rallying point told Reuters: \"They threatened us with our jobs, said they would cut our salaries off if we came, they can keep the salaries! Why all this blood? Why have all these young men lost their lives?\u201d\n\nAn Iraqi government committee investigated the first wave of rallies and found that 149 civilians were killed because security forces used excessive force and live fire to quell protests.\n\nThe report said more than 70 of the deaths were caused by shots to the head or chest and held senior commanders responsible but stopped short of blaming the prime minister.\n\nThe United Nations mission in Iraq has accused the Iraqi authorities of committing serious human rights violations and abuses in their handling of the unrest.\n\nKarbala, a Shia shrine city, is home to the tombs of the saints Abbas and Hussein, a highly revered figure in both Iran and Iraq whose 7th-century death at the hands of the then Caliph became a rallying cry against injustice.\n\nPolitically well-connected Iranian firms have poured tens of millions of dollars in the shrine city of Karbala, building hotels and other businesses that facilitate the highly lucrative pilgrimages of millions of Shia from across the Middle East and South Asia.\n\nIranian officials have been worried about the weeks-long anti-government unrest in Karbala, according to a former official briefed on the matter, concerned protesters\u2019 spirit of defiance could inspire uprisings in Iran.\n\nThe city of 700,000 about 60 miles south of Baghdad is home to seminaries that train religious scholars from the Middle East and South Asia, and is well-connected to scholastic institutions in the Iranian cities of Qom and Mashhad.\n\nMr Abdul Mahdi, who took office just one year ago, has promised reforms and ordered a broad reshuffle of the cabinet but that has failed to quell the unrest.\n\nOn Sunday a government spokesman warned that anyone disrupting work or skipping school would be severely punished.\n\nDespite its vast oil wealth, OPEC member Iraq suffers from soaring unemployment and crumbling infrastructure, with many households blighted by power cuts, as well as limited access to clean water and health care.\n\nThe unrest has shattered nearly two years of relative stability in Iraq, which was recovering from foreign occupation, civil war and an Islamic State insurgency between 2003 and 2017.\n\nWith agencies", "description": "At least 18 people have been killed and 800 wounded in Iraq when masked gunmen opened fire on protesters in the Shiite holy city of Karbala on Tuesday, security officials have said.
