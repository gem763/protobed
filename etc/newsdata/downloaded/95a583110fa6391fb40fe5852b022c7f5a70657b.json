Van Buren Township, Michigan-based Visteon said it had net income of $14 million, or 50 cents a share, in the quarter, down from $21 million, or 71 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales came to $731 million, up from $681 million a year ago. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of 48 cents and sales of $703 million. \"The increase of $50 million is primarily due to new product launches and the consolidation of a previously non-consolidated affiliate, partially offset by lower vehicle production volumes, customer pricing and unfavorable currency impacts,\" the company said in a statement. The company is now expecting full-year sales to range from $2.925 billion to $2.975 billion, ahead of the $2.911 billion FactSet consensus. On the company's earnings call with analysts, Chief Executive Sachin Lawande said the company's new business wins for the first three quarters totaled $4.6 billion, with two thirds of that based on the next-generation digital platforms. \"We added a new automaker to our customer base during the quarter, expanding our customer portfolio by two year-to-date,\" Lawande said, according to a FactSet transcript. The company launched 12 new products in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 35. \"We launched our first cluster with Great Wall Motors, one of the leading car manufacturers in China,\" he said. .. And we're hopeful that this successful launch will lead to more business in the future with Great Wall.\" Shares have gained 58% in 2019, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.00% has gained 20%.", "description": "Visteon Corp. shares rallied 13% Thursday, after the maker of plane and car parts blew past estimates for the third quarter.
