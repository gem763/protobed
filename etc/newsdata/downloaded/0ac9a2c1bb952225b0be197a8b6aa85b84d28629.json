(AP) - Christian Pulisic thinks about all the talented young American players and thinks they could go far in next year\u2019s Olympic men\u2019s soccer tournament, perhaps himself included.\n\n\u201cI would never completely count that out because it\u2019s a huge honor to play for your country in the Olympics,\u201d the 20-year-old Chelsea midfielder said Wednesday, two days before the U.S. senior national team plays Mexico in an exhibition.\n\nOlympic men\u2019s soccer qualifying is limited to players under 23, with three overage players allowed for the final tournament in Japan. Age-eligible Americans include Pulisic and midfielders Weston McKennie, Tyler Adams and Tim Weah.\n\nClubs, however, are not required to release players for the Olympics or for qualifying, scheduled for March 20 to April 1 in the North and Central American and Caribbean region. The Olympic soccer tournament runs from July 23 to Aug. 8 in and likely would overlap a contemplated preseason tour by Chelsea and perhaps the start of the Premier League season.\n\n\u201cA lot of factors come into play, I guess, but we\u2019ll see,\u201d Pulisic said.\n\nThe United States failed to qualify for the 2012 and 2016 Olympic men\u2019s soccer tournaments, a stumble that preceded the senior team\u2019s failure to reach for last year\u2019s World Cup. Pulisic thinks the U.S. could emulate Mexico, which won the 2012 Olympic men\u2019s soccer gold.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a confident young group of guys and I think there\u2019s no reason why we couldn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWe set big goals for ourselves and, yeah, that would be one of them. That would be something I think we could do.\u201d\n\nPulisic was acquired by Chelsea in January from Borussia Dortmund for a 64 million euros (then $73 million) transfer fee, the most for an American player, then loaned back to the German club for the remainder of the season. He made his Premier League debut in the opening 4-0 loss at Manchester United and has started the last three league matches under new coach Frank Lampard, who replaced Maurizio Sarri.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. I mean, it\u2019s everything I hoped it would be and more. It\u2019s incredible,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cIt worked out really well, for sure. Frank\u2019s a great guy and he\u2019s helped me so much and he understands where I\u2019m coming from and he\u2019s done a really good job and helped me, teaching us, especially a lot of the younger guys on the team.\u201d\n\nPulisic laughed when asked who was the better player: himself or Mexican winger Hirving Lozano,\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to give you like an Ibra answer here,\u201d he said in a reference to huge-egoed LA Galaxy striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who two years ago boasted \u201clions do not compare themselves to humans\u201d when asked where he ranked himself among strikers. Pulisic, naturally introverted, is reticent at times when speaking with media.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never be comfortable. I don\u2019t like being in front of cameras,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still getting used to it, I guess.\u201d\n\nPulisic will be part of a rare trio of Americans this fall in Champions League Group D, joined by 18-year-old Ajax defender Sergi\u00f1o Dest and Weah\u2019s Lille, who is missing the match against Mexico and Tuesday\u2019s friendly against Uruguay because of a hamstring injury.\n\nDest introduced himself to Pulisic this week and joked about the possibility of playing against him.\n\n\u201cI was asking him are you playing on the left side, right side, things like that?\u201d Dest said with a smile.\n\nPulisic left Hershey, Pennsylvania, to sign with Dortmund at age 16. While living in Germany, he could meet up with McKennie, a starter for Schalke. McKennie is proud of his friend but doesn\u2019t have a chance to follow his club exploits too closely.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a big guy to watch sports,\u201d McKennie said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a big deal whenever you have an American you know being in Europe let alone at a giant club like Chelsea. I\u2019ve heard he\u2019s been doing well.\u201d\n\nPulisic has played primarily on the flanks with Chelsea, and falling back deep at times is part of his responsibility\n\n\u201cLearning to help more on the defensive side of things, which is like a good challenge for me, as well,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the U.S., he has increasingly ventured into the central portion of the field. Coach Gregg Berhalter changed Pulisic\u2019s listing from midfield to forward for this training camp.\n\n\u201cWe want him to be able to affect games in a number of different ways,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cWe want to be able to isolate him one vs. one at times but we also want him getting them ball between the lines.\u201d\n\nNotes: Dest played for the U.S. at this year\u2019s Under-20 World Cup and could make his senior debut Friday. He said the Royal Dutch Football Association contacted him about the possibility of playing for the Netherlands\u2019 Under-23 team. Dest said he was not sure whether he would accept an invite from the U.S. for next month\u2019s CONCACAF Nations League camp. By playing in a competitive senior match, Dest would tie himself to the U.S.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Christian Pulisic thinks about all the talented young American players and thinks they could go far in next year's Olympic men's soccer tournament, perhaps himself included.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ronald Blum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/britain_soccer_premier_league_79157_c0-134-3500-2174_s1770x1032.jpg?6fd869feb1828645dbad9e5d99071caa9544e6ba"}
