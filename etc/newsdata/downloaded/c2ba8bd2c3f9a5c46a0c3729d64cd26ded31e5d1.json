Yee said in a tweet at the time that the initiative was meant to \u201csupport innovation, but also ensure that new technologies ultimately result in a net common good.\u201d According to the Chronicle, the office will be responsible for permitting companies with technologies not yet covered by city regulations.\n\n\u201cWe have been in conversations with city agencies, tech, labour, and community groups to help develop this office. We look forward to continuing this collaborative approach to emerging tech,\u201d Yee said of the proposal.\n\nCity Administrator Naomi Kelly, who with Yee introduced the legislation last week, said in a statement that the foremost priority to come out of those meetings with various groups was \u201ca centralised \u2018front door\u2019 to pilot technologies and evaluate their impacts.\u201d\n\nThe Chronicle reported that the office would launch with a $US250,000 ($369,055) budget and would handle the one-year permitting process for emerging tech.\n\nAs much as the office would be a benefit to residents of San Francisco who have grown tired of watching emerging technologies litter public spaces or interrupt pedestrian walkways \u2014 as was the case last year when scooters startups bombarded the city\u2019s streets \u2014 it also stands to benefit startups by helping identify potential regulatory hurdles or permitting issues.\n\nJennifer Stojkovich, executive director of technology trade group sf.citi, commended the initiative, adding in a statement that sf.citi looks forward \u201cto continuing to work in partnership with President Yee and the City to develop responsive and swift policies and regulations that support both innovation and our city\u2019s residents.\u201d\n\nNPR-member station KQED reported that residents will have a 30-day window to provide feedback on the new office proposal before it is heard and voted on twice by the Board of Supervisors. We\u2019ve reached out to the city for more information and will update this post if we hear back.", "description": "The Wild West days of unapproved or unwanted technology infiltrating public spaces in San Francisco without permission from the city may be nearing their end....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "James Whitbrook"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/jhyk1kmiayyj6blu7ycw.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
