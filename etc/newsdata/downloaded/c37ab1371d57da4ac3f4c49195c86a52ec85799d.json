Ilhan Omar files for divorce, citing an irretrievable marital breakdown", "language": "en", "text": "Freshman Democrat Ilhan Omar cited an \u201cirretrievable breakdown\u201d of her marriage with Ahmed Hirsi, whom, according to marriage license documentation, she married in 2018, in her filing Friday in Hennepin County District Court. Aside from a period of separation in which Omar married another man \u2014 Ahmed Nur Said Elmi \u2014 Omar and Hirsi had been a couple for years, and he is the father of her three children.\n\nDivorce records show Omar legally married Hirsi after her divorce from Elmi was finalized.\n\nThe Moneyist: My husband sponsored me to move to the U.S., but he kept a $200K windfall and insists I pay all the bills\n\nOmar\u2019s filing comes more than a month after a Washington, D.C., woman in her own divorce filing accused Omar of having an affair with her husband. That woman\u2019s husband, who has worked as a political consultant for Omar, denied his wife\u2019s assertion in court papers.\n\nWhen Omar was asked at the time whether she was separated from her husband or dating someone, she told WCCO-TV, \u201cNo, I am not.\u201d She has since declined to discuss her personal life.\n\nOmar\u2019s attorney, Jaime Driggs, issued a statement Monday saying: \u201cAs with all marriages, this is intensely personal and a difficult time for their family. For years, Ilhan and Ahmed have been the object of speculation and innuendo from political opponents and the media.\u201d\n\nDriggs said this has taken a toll on the family and Omar wished for privacy and would have no further comment.\n\nWhen asked specifically whether Omar had had an affair, Driggs did not answer but referred back to his statement. Omar\u2019s office did not return a message seeking comment.\n\nThe court case does not list an attorney for Hirsi. A working phone number for Hirsi was not immediately available and he did not return emailed requests for comment.\n\nOmar has been dogged by questions about her personal life since she first ran for state representative in 2016, with some conservatives alleging she was married to two men at once, and that one of them was her brother \u2014 claims she called \u201cdisgusting lies.\u201d\n\nThe claim that Omar married her brother was repeated by President Donald Trump, who has made Omar a frequent target of attacks on Twitter and in public, including one rally in which he said Omar and three other Democratic congresswomen of color should \u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries. All four women are U.S. citizens, and Omar is the only one who wasn\u2019t born in the U.S.\n\nRead on: Getting divorced cost this woman nearly $1 million in retirement savings \u2014 how to avoid her fate", "description": "The freshman Democrat cited an \u201cirretrievable breakdown\u201d of her marriage with Ahmed Hirsi, whom, according to marriage license documentation, she married in...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS797_omar_i_ZG_20191007141550.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
