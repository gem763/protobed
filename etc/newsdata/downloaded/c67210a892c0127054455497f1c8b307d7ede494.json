But not as bad as it has turned out to be,\u201d Abubakar Kari, a professor of political sociology at Abuja University, told Radio France Internationale.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the age-old culture of the Hausa and Fulani that has not faded away, to send delinquent children to such homes where corporal punishment is used, presumably to cure them of delinquent behavior,\u201d he explained.\n\nKari noted that one of the main issues with the facilities is that they remain largely unregulated and that teachers require no formal training or approval to work with children.\n\n\u201cJust about anybody can become a Malam (cleric) to whom parents just give their children,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cschools don\u2019t issue any certificates at the end of the children\u2019s stay, meaning there is no formal curricula.\u201d\n\nOne of the victims, Isa Ibrahim, told the BBC in an interview how he had been tortured by those in charge. \u201cEvery day they would give me 30 lashes, ten in the morning, ten in the afternoon, and ten in the night,\u201d he said. \u201cI was tortured, I was deprived, I was beaten, I was treated like an animal.\u201d\n\nHe continued:\n\n[It was] 40 people to a room. How can you imagine we sleep here? There is no blanket, no bed sheet, and that food they would give us would not even satisfy a dog. If you want to take a bath they will give you one bucket and assign 10 or 20 people \u2026 you will be naked taking bath with about 20 people using one soap. Most of the people from [this facility] have rashes on them, or psychological disorders. My parents brought me here because I did not go back to school on time. Each month they pay 30,000 naira ($83). We are not even praying. The owner of the house used to pick two or three people that he needs to rape, that\u2019s what he wanted\u2026 If you didn\u2019t comply with what he wishes, he will the guards that are living in the house to torture you.\n\nHafsat Baba, Kaduna State Commissioner of Human Services and Social Development said that the region would comply with President Buhari\u2019s orders.\n\n\u201cThis is an eye-opener for us. We have to map all the schools. And we have to make sure that if they violate the government orders then they have to be closed down completely,\u201d he said this month. \u201cIf we find any facility that is torturing children or is harboring these kinds of horrific situations that we have just seen, they are going to be prosecuted.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "President\u00a0Muhammadu Buhari\u00a0announced a major crackdown against so-called \"Islamic reform schools\" in Nigeria Monday.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/GettyImages-1154618758-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
