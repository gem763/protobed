It is alarmist to say that a modern spike in populism will bring on the widespread global destruction wrought by the populists of the middle 20th century, however, it does present a threat which needs to be properly addressed by mainstream politicians.\n\nWhile populism may be poorly understood, a common theme among populist movements is a hollow platform to \u201ctell the people what they want to hear.\u201d Populism as a political ideology does not rest on solid convictions, and this works precisely to its benefit. Since the 1990s, conventional wisdom has been that when it comes to what people want from government, it is, as the political strategist James Carville famously said during the 1992 presidential election, \u201cthe economy, stupid.\u201d\n\nGovernments which successfully invigorate economic growth should expect to win reelection and stave off potential populist insurgencies. Why then has the past decade, which has seen unprecedented economic growth after the recession, been a time during which a populist wave is sweeping the world? Populism plays to the emotions of ordinary people. Populists promise nothing more than to make people happy or restore former national glory, as with President Trump and President Erdogan.", "description": "", "authors": ["Douglas Schoen", "Thehill.Com Opinion International"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
