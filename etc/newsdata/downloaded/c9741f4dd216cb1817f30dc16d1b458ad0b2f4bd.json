Action Against Iran", "language": "en", "text": "President Trump is likely to face an uphill battle in mobilizing international support for tough action against Iran by the United Nations during his trip this week to the annual General Assembly meeting, Western diplomats and experts said.\n\nA senior administration official said that the U.S. plans to make Iran\u2019s \u201cexploratory violence\u201d a theme of this year\u2019s gathering of world leaders and foreign ministers, following Tehran\u2019s alleged missile strike on Saudi oil facilities.\n\n\u201cThe president believes that personal diplomacy is his strength,\u201d the official said. Another administration official said the Sept. 14 Saudi attack warrants U.N. action.\n\nThe U.N. meeting comes after the Trump administration last week imposed new sanctions against Iranian financial institutions and announced the U.S. is sending additional military hardware and forces to Saudi Arabia.\n\nWestern diplomats, however, said they have been given no indication yet that the U.S. intends to push for action by the U.N. Security Council, which has the authority to impose sanctions and authorize military action. At the U.N., the process developing resolutions capable of winning support on the 15-member Council can take weeks.\n\nIn a further complication, Russia is chairing the Security Council in September, and both Russia and China have veto authority in the body. Neither is considered likely to favor biting economic measures, let alone concerted military action.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s quest for support through the U.N. also follows years in which he has pressed what he calls an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy and has criticized international organizations like the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as ineffective.\n\nShort of international action by the U.N., Mr. Trump has the option of using the world body as a venue for top-level consultations with foreign partners to expand Washington\u2019s own maximum pressure campaign against Tehran.\n\nEven that avenue, however, faces potential challenges for Mr. Trump, who isn\u2019t currently scheduled to meet with many of the leaders who would be instrumental in a campaign to step up the pressure on Iran.\n\nThe leaders of Saudi Arabia, other Persian Gulf states and Israel aren\u2019t scheduled to attend the U.N. gathering this year. The leaders of France, Jordan and Germany, will be present at the General Assembly session, but aren\u2019t currently on the White House list for private meetings with Mr. Trump.\n\nThe White House has outlined plans for Mr. Trump to meet personally with the leaders of Egypt, El Salvador, India, Iraq, Japan, New Zealand, Pakistan, Poland, Singapore, South Kprea, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, saying the schedule could change.\n\nAdding to the drama, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is expected to seek to counter Mr. Trump at every turn. While Mr. Trump will be making his case to the General Assembly in a Tuesday address, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is scheduled to speak to the body on Wednesday before holding a press conference later in the week.\n\nIn a cabinet meeting on Friday, the Iranian president previewed some of the themes he is expected to strike at the U.N., blaming Washington for escalating tensions. \u201cThe Americans should understand that warmongering and warmongers are not doing any good for them,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Rouhani announced he would use his U.N. address to present a \u201cpeace initiative\u201d to avert hostilities in the Strait of Hormuz and complained that the presence of foreign forces endangers the region.\n\nMr. Trump, nonetheless, has some cards to play in countering Mr. Rouhani. His decision until now to avoid the use of force is likely to be welcomed by many allies who are fearful of another Middle East war and the prospect that Persian Gulf oil supplies could be cut off.\n\nU.S. officials insist there is solid intelligence that Iran is responsible for the missile strikes in Saudi Arabia. Western diplomats said the administration\u2019s evolving strategy is aimed at letting the Saudis take the lead in condemning Iran in various U.N. forums pending the results of an investigation by international experts into the attack.\n\nIran is also bringing diplomatic baggage to the U.N.\n\nWhen the General Assembly convened a year ago, Iran was adhering to the limits set by the 2015 accord that constrained Iran\u2019s nuclear program but which the Trump administration exited on the ground that it wasn\u2019t strict enough and didn\u2019t apply to Iran\u2019s assertive regional posture.\n\nBut now, Iran has decided to exceed limits on the stockpile of enriched uranium it is allowed to amass under the accord, has undertaken nuclear research currently banned under the agreement and has modestly increased uranium enrichment levels in violation of the accord, international inspectors have said.\n\nIran also has been accused by the U.S. of attacking tankers in the Gulf of Oman.\n\nOne key figure at this week\u2019s U.N. gathering will be French President Emmanuel Macron, who has been trying to keep the slim prospects for diplomacy alive.\n\nThere is no sign, however, that the Trump administration is prepared to provide Iran with the limited economic relief Mr. Macron has proposed in return for Iranian compliance with the 2015 accord.\n\nThe departure of John Bolton as Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, some experts say, has removed an obstacle for an eventual meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Rouhani. But both sides have indicated that isn\u2019t in the cards now.\n\n\u201cTrump wants a meeting without sanctions relief\u2014that\u2019s true regardless of whether Bolton is in the picture,\u201d said Henry Rome, an analyst on Iran at the Eurasia Group, a New York-based think tank. \u201cIran wants sanctions relief without a meeting\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard enough for conservatives in Iran to stomach a meeting with a U.S. president, harder still with someone like Trump,\u201d he added. \u201cBut a meeting with no tangible economic benefits? No way.\u201d\n\nWrite to Michael R.
