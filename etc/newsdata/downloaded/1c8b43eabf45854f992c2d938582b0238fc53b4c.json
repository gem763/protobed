REUTERS/Mike Hutchings/File Photo\n\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Sacked Old Mutual CEO Peter Moyo intends to return to his desk next week, his lawyer said on Friday after a South African court dismissed the insurer\u2019s attempt to block his temporary reinstatement.\n\nMoyo was fired in June in relation to a dispute over a conflict of interest, but was temporarily reinstated by the court in July. However, Old Mutual said he could not return to work while it appealed the judgement.\n\nThe insurer had asked the court to rule whether it agreed that the appeal suspended the previous judgement, and also on Old Mutual\u2019s view that a temporary reinstatement would in effect be permanent as a court case against his dismissal would be lengthy.\n\n\u201cThe respondents have succeeded to persuade this court that the operation and execution of the orders should not be suspended,\u201d Judge Brian Mashile said in a written judgement said seen by Reuters.\n\nMoyo\u2019s lawyer confirmed the ruling, and said he intended to return to work on Monday.\n\nThe Old Mutual board has repeatedly said a breakdown in relations and trust with Moyo is such that it is untenable for him to continue as CEO, and fired him for a second time in August. Its shares rose on Friday, and were up 0.88% at 1235 GMT.\n\nAn Old Mutual spokeswoman insisted that Moyo\u2019s second sacking in August still prevented him from returning to work, adding that the insurer had also been granted leave to appeal the July court decision.\n\nMoyo had also applied twice to have Old Mutual declared in contempt of court over its refusal to allow him back to work.\n\nThe court was still hearing the contempt of court applications.", "description": "Sacked Old Mutual CEO Peter Moyo intends to return to his desk next week, his lawyer said on Friday after a South African court dismissed the insurer's attempt to block his temporary reinstatement.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426912635&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8516Q-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
