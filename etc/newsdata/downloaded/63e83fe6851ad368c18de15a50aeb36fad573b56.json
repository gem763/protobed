(AP) - Cole Beasley knows little about the decades of dominance from the New England Patriots against his new team, the Buffalo Bills.\n\nAnd he\u2019s not particularly interested in it.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t here, I don\u2019t care,\u201d Beasley said.\n\nBeasley is one of several new members of the upstart Bills who will get their first taste of what\u2019s been a lopsided AFC East rivalry when the undefeated Bills host the undefeated Patriots this Sunday.\n\nIt will be yet another chance for the Bills to turn things around, with Buffalo already off to its first 3-0 start since 2011.\n\nBuffalo is looking to use that youthful ignorance in its favor.\n\n\u201cSometimes with young people, you study the past and you respect the past and you learn from it,\u201d Bills coach Sean McDermott said. \u201cBut a lot of these guys are just focused on the present and that\u2019s good, right?\u201d\n\nFocusing on the present and not the past is certainly in Buffalo\u2019s favor when it comes to recent history against the Patriots.\n\nNew England has won 33 of its past 37 games against the Bills, dominating their division rival ever since Tom Brady took over as New England\u2019s quarterback.\n\nAnd some of those Bills wins even came when the Patriots were not at full strength; one was a meaningless season finale for the Patriots, who rested most of their starters for a half, another didn\u2019t feature Brady as part of his \u201cDeflategate\u201d suspension.\n\nBuffalo\u2019s last \u201cunblemished\u201d win over the Patriots came in September 2011, when the Bills overcame a 21-0 deficit to topple New England, 34-31.\n\nThat\u2019s a game that veteran tight end Lee Smith remembers well - though, after returning this offseason in free agency, he\u2019s the only current Bill who was a member of that team.\n\n\u201cMy last year here was \u201814 until this year and Jerry Hughes is the only guy left,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSo 48 months ago I left this place and now I\u2019m back and Jerry is the only familiar face in the locker room. \u2026 The amount of success they\u2019ve had speaks for itself. They\u2019ve got what all of us are after. Hopefully that story changes Sunday and there\u2019s 53 dudes who can say the same thing (that can be) said about me.\u201d\n\nSeveral Bills have little-to-no recollection of New England\u2019s dominance over Buffalo.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know a lot, if any, at all,\u201d first-round defensive tackle Ed Oliver said. \u201cI just know it\u2019s a big game.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it, dude,\u201d Beasley said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s another game, another week, just preparing the same way we do every other week. It\u2019s all about the process for us and we still have so many new guys on offense, I don\u2019t know what the number is, like eight new guys on offense or something crazy. We\u2019re just trying to figure out what we do well and what we do best.\u201d\n\nOne main key for Buffalo will be for that new-look offense to put up points against a stingy Patriots defense. The Patriots have surrendered only 17 points through three games, ranking first in the NFL in both points and yards allowed.\n\n\u201cTheir numbers are staggering, really, almost unheard of,\u201d McDermott said.\n\nThen there\u2019s Brady, who has had Buffalo\u2019s number throughout his career. McDermott referred to Brady as \u201cthe greatest quarterback to ever play the game,\u201d which was a common refrain throughout the Bills locker room on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cYou know I agree with that, come on, man,\u201d safety Micah Hyde said. \u201cWhat am I supposed to say, no? Yeah, of course. Look at his stats, look at what he\u2019s been able to do for 20 years. He\u2019s a beast, man. You\u2019ve got to give him all the credit. I\u2019m not going to be playing into my 40s, I can tell you that.\u201d\n\nBrady\u2019s only losses in games against the Bills at full strength came in 2011 and in the season opener back in 2003. His 30 wins against the Bills are the most by any quarterback against a single team.\n\n\u201cThat means he\u2019s bound to lose another one, right?\u201d Beasley said with a laugh.\n\nNOTES: LB Corey Thompson is out indefinitely after undergoing ankle surgery. Bills coach Sean McDermott said Thompson should be back later this season. \u2026 RB Devin Singletary (hamstring) missed practice again on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Cole Beasley knows little about the decades of dominance from the New England Patriots against his new team, the Buffalo Bills.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Ludwiczak"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
