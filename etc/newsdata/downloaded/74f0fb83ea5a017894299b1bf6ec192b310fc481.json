Police aren\u2019t sure of the nationalities of the deceased and expect identifying them will be a lengthy process. The NY Times reports the two sections of the truck followed different routes to enter the country:\n\nThe police initially said they believed the truck had entered Britain at the port of Holyhead in Wales on Saturday, but later clarified that only the Bulgarian-registered tractor \u2014 the front of the truck, with the driver\u2019s cab and engine \u2014 had traveled that route. The cargo trailer it was pulling had entered Britain at Purfleet, a shipping port near Grays, where it was collected by the driver early Wednesday, they said. Police believe the container came from Zeebrugge in Belgium and arrived in Britain shortly after 12:30 a.m. Wednesday\u2026 While the circumstances that led to the deaths remained unclear, the trailer appeared to be refrigerated. Such containers are typically tightly sealed, said Dave Wood, a former director general of British immigration enforcement, creating the risk that anyone traveling inside one could die of suffocation.\n\nThe BBC reports the identity of the driver:\n\nThe lorry driver, named locally as Mo Robinson, 25, from the Portadown area of County Armagh, Northern Ireland, has been arrested on suspicion of murder\u2026 Richard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said the container appeared to be a refrigerated unit, where temperatures could be as low as -25C. He described conditions for anyone inside as \u201cabsolutely horrendous\u201d.\n\nCNN reports smugglers are taking greater risks using refrigerated trucks and cargo containers to transport people because new technology has made the crossing from France much more difficult:\n\nToday, with more stringent border checks in place \u2014 utilizing technology like thermal imaging cameras to identify migrants hidden within vehicles \u2014 the option has become much more difficult and costly to attempt, with smugglers charging thousands of euros for passage. \u201cThe UK has invested a lot of money in protecting the lorry routes\u201d from migrants crossing from France, said Nando Sigona, an associate professor in international migration at the University of Birmingham told CNN earlier this year. \u201cThat route has probably been sealed off, or made more difficult to pursue.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll update this story if there are significant developments during the day. For now, here\u2019s a Sky News report from earlier this morning:", "description": "\"The lorry driver...has been arrested on suspicion of murder\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Essex-truck.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
