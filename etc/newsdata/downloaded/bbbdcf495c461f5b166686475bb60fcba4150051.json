But when the whistleblower complaint was finally released to the public on Thursday, a bigger problem with the altered OLC opinion arose: It did not address allegations of a White House cover-up at all. It simply ignored the accusation that officials placed the Trump-Zelensky memo in a system reserved for classified materials.\n\nThat mystery was solved, in part, when the OLC released a redacted version of its original opinion on Thursday. This document, dated Sept. 3, does address the alleged cover-up\u2014in a single footnote. \u201cThe complainant stated that some officials at the White House had advised that this action may have been an abuse of the system,\u201d OLC acknowledged, but Atkinson \u201cdid not discuss this allegation in concluding that the complaint stated an urgent concern.\u201d", "description": "The OLC opinion \u201ccreates a chilling effect on effective oversight and is wrong as a matter of law and policy,\u201d the letter says.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db3237c200000cc27506cde.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
