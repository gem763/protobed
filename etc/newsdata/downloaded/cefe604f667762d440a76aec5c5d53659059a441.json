Plans to broadcast two N.B.A. preseason games were canceled and some Chinese companies suspended partnerships with the league.\n\nNow, the Chinese government appears to be reassessing its campaign against the N.B.A. and dialing down the clamor. The government is already in a bruising trade war with the United States, and a backlash against China could hurt its image in the sporting world ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics near Beijing. The dispute with the N.B.A. was also quickly politicizing an audience of sports fans who would not normally focus on issues like the protests in Hong Kong.\n\nEditors at state news outlets have told reporters to avoid emphasizing the N.B.A. issue for fear that it might become overheated, according to interviews with three journalists on Thursday.", "description": "China has clamped down on state media coverage and online discussion of an American basketball executive\u2019s tweet about the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Keith Bradsher", "Javier C.
