What the meta study regarding meat consumption showed was that government and institutional policy has been totally driven by nothing other than cultural or religious preferences, and of course financial and political considerations. Any claim to the contrary has been a complete lie.\n\nChronic disease is rampant in the United States, and at this point throughout the world. The biggest single environmental factor is food. Unfortunately what has been established without any doubt by this latest meta-analysis is that you are on your own. There is no evidence to back up any of the U.S. food-policy recommendations of the past half-century. It has all been a complete fraud, so if you value your health and the health of your children, you better get serious about figuring out where you fall on the omnivore spectrum. The institutional recommendations never had any scientific evidence behind them, and the U.S. population has suffered the consequences.\n\nSAMUEL BURKEEN\n\nReston, Va.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
