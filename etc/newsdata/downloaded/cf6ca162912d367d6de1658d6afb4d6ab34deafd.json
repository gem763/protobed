The PM immediately said he would legislate for an early election with a bill not subject to a super-majority.\n\nWhat next\n\nNot for the first time: it all depends. With Johnson having lost his third attempt at an election under the terms of the FTPA, the government will table a one-line bill for a pre-Christmas poll that would have the support of the Lib Dems and the SNP.\n\nThis would be more likely to pass because, as a traditional bill, it requires only a simple majority. However, it would be amendable, and while the Lib Dems and the SNP may be unlikely to table amendments, Labour might.\n\nThe Conservatives believe Johnson can win an election, and seem happy for him to campaign on the grounds that he has secured a Brexit deal and just needs a clear majority to get it ratified. The Lib Dems, as the revoke Brexit party, want an early election because they know their chances of a good result will diminish drastically once Brexit has happened.\n\nBut Labour? Trailing in the polls, the party is still divided, with some arguing it is more than ready for an election and pointing out that it did far better than polls predicted in 2017 \u2013 and others seriously doubting Labour has any hope of success as long as Corbyn remains leader.\n\nWith the other two main opposition parties looking ready to back an early poll, however, it may be impossible for Labour not to this time round, and Corbyn appeared to suggest on Monday that the party could back a 9 December poll if the date was set in law.\n\nBest of the rest\n\nTop comment\n\nIn the Observer, Neil Ascherson argues that long Brexit ordeal will end up finishing off the break-up of Great Britain:\n\nThe deepest change since 2016 is the weakening of the UK\u2019s inner bonds. Theresa May went around preaching about \u201cour precious, precious union\u201d. This puzzled me, given massive English indifference. Then I understood: it wasn\u2019t Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland that was \u201cprecious\u201d to her, but \u201cthe union\u201d in the abstract \u2013 a sort of legitimising halo hovering over Westminster\u2019s anointed \u2026 Yet in the union of four nations, one \u2013 England \u2013 has 85% of the population. What the past three years have shown is that the big partner is no longer concerned to put its own interests behind those of the others. A poll this year showed that Tory voters would be ready to \u201close Scotland\u201d (revealing words) if that ensured Brexit. In turn, devolution only made sense when all four nations were inside the EU. If England in 2019 can no longer remember why the union with Scotland and Northern Ireland once made sense, Brexit has delivered the UK to the hospice of history.\n\nTop tweet\n\nBrexit\u2019s current absurdities neatly put by the Atlantic\u2019s Tom McTague:", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s third attempt at an election under the FTPA was blocked by Labour", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cab20ef77d38ed9e96a17693cdecfbf0a2ba5395/0_44_2266_1360/master/2266.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5ffc6ed661adfa394685b3f2414519aa", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
