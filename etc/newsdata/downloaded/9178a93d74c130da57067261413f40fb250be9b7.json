Chuck Grassley (R-IA) smells something rotten in that new book by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation. The book, which is accompanied by a New York Times report summarizing the authors' findings, concludes there is a sexual misconduct allegation against the Supreme Court Justice in addition to the one that nearly cost him his confirmation last year. Kavanaugh vehemently denied having assaulted his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford. Now, Pogrebin and Kelly claim, Kavanaugh must answer for the allegation that he exposed himself to a young woman named Deborah Ramirez back in college.\n\nSkeptics have poked some holes in the anonymously sourced Times report, so Sen. Grassley poked a few more.\n\nFirst off, his staff reminds the Times, when the senator was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, they tried and failed several times to give Ramirez a chance to provide evidence for her claims.\n\n2. Despite 7 attempts by staff, Ms. Ramirez' lawyers declined to provide documentary evidence referenced in the article/witness accounts to support the claims. They also declined invitations for Ms. Ramirez to speak with committee investigators or to provide a written statement. \u2014 Sen. Grassley Press (@GrassleyPress) September 15, 2019\n\nGrassley makes a few more points. The committee investigated the Ramirez claims themselves and found no substantial evidence. The Times itself admits in their bombshell report that they could find no one - no one - willing to go on record to corroborate the claims in their story.\n\n4. The committee's review found no verifiable evidence to support the claims. The @nytimes' own reporting at the time noted that it couldn't find anyone with firsthand knowledge & that Ms. Ramirez told friends she couldn\u2019t be sure Kavanaugh was involved: https://t.co/e1B4ckSGhr pic.twitter.com/Wj1g9dCleo \u2014 Sen.
