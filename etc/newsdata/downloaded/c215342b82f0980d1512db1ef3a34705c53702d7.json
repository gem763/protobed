The 25,000 visas for those willing to live in smaller cities and regions are part of the annual migration cap.\n\nNearly a third of Australia's resident population were born overseas, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD.\n\nAustralia, a highly urbanised country with one of the highest population growth rates in the OECD, has about two-thirds of its population living in the capitals of states and territories, according to the 2016 government census data.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2018 the number of people living in those cities increased at twice the rate the number of people living outside them, recent government data show. Capital city growth accounted for 79% of Australia's total population growth.\n\n\"We're using our migration programme to back our regions to grow to take the population pressure off our major capital cities and by supporting strong regions we're creating an even stronger economy for Australia,\" Morrison said.\n\nMigrants willing to live in locations outside of Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane will have access to priority processing and international university graduates who live in these locations will be eligible to apply for more time in Australia on a post-study work visa.
