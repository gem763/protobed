We live in a very big house and we don't bump into each other for hours on end.\"\n\nElton, now 72, also revealed his struggle with mental health - he even tried to take his own life.\n\nHe had been \"insecure and body-conscious and self-loathing\", and this led to his suicide attempt.\n\nHe says: \"One night, while I was recording with the new band up at Caribou Studios, I took an overdose of Valium before I went to bed. Twelve tablets.\n\n\"I can't remember what exactly prompted me to do that, although it was probably some catastrophic love affair gone wrong.\"\n\nLater, Elton details a stint in rehab during the early Nineties and how it was brought about by a struggling relationship with a man named Hugh.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I called Hugh,\" Elton writes, \"who agreed to meet, but only in the presence of his counsellor.\n\n\"The next day, I was in a tiny motel room in America, facing Hugh. The counsellor had told us both to make a list of things we didn't like about each other and then read it out.\n\n\"I went first.\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\n(Image: Getty Images for EJAF)\n\n\"I said that I didn't like the fact that Hugh was untidy. He left his clothes everywhere, and didn't put CDs back in their cases.\n\n\"Then it was Hugh's turn. I noticed he was shaking. 'You're a drug addict,' he said. 'You're an alcoholic. You're a food addict and a bulimic. You're a sex addict. You're co-dependent.'\n\n\"There was a long pause. He clearly thought I was going to explode again.\n\n\"'Yes,' I said, 'Yes, I am.'\"\n\nLater, Elton continues that being treated for three addictions wasn't so simple.\n\n\"Getting help wasn't straightforward, as I needed to be treated for three addictions at once: cocaine, alcohol and food. On July 29, 1990, I ended up in the only place I could find that would take me - an ordinary general hospital in Chicago, with a view over a shopping-centre car park.\n\n\"A consultant asked me how I was feeling, and I told him the truth: I didn't know.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if I'd had any real feelings for years, or whether everything was the result of the constant see-sawing of emotions brought on by drugs and booze.\"\n\n*Me: Elton John is published on October 15", "description": "Sir Elton's shocking new memoirs delve into the activities of his generation's music legends, including Rod Stewart's love life", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Getty", "Getty Images", "Pa", "Wireimage", "Getty Images For Ejaf"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20067871.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Rod-Stewart-At-The-Rosemont-Horizon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
