Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops in the lining that covers the outer surface of some of the body's organs. It's usually linked to asbestos exposure. It mainly affects the lining of the lungs (pleural mesothelioma), although it can also affect the lining of the tummy (peritoneal mesothelioma), heart or testicles. More than 2,600 people are diagnosed with the condition each year in the UK. Most cases are diagnosed in people aged 60-80 and men are affected more commonly than women. Unfortunately it's rarely possible to cure mesothelioma, although treatment can help control the symptoms. The symptoms of mesothelioma tend to develop gradually over time. They typically don't appear until several decades after exposure to asbestos. Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos, a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres that used to be widely used in construction. These tiny fibres can easily get in the lungs, where they get stuck, damaging the lungs over time. It usually takes a while for this to cause any obvious problems, with mesothelioma typically developing more than 20 years after exposure to asbestos. The use of asbestos was completely banned in 1999, so the risk of exposure is much lower nowadays. However, materials containing asbestos are still found in many older buildings.

Attorneys for the company claimed that Cabibi - who now resides in Idaho with her husband, Phil - had been exposed to asbestos while living in an industrial area of Los Angeles.\n\nCancer from these kinds of asbestos exposures is fairly common among factory workers, but Cabibi's attorneys say she never worked in a factor, and the jury determined Friday that atmospheric exposure wouldn't have been enough to trigger cancer.\n\nIt's not clear how much baby powder or other Johnson & Johnson products Cabibi used, or for how long she used it, but she claimed they were common products for her.\n\nBut once she developed mesothelioma, Cabibi's cancer-riddled body tissue was tested for asbestos exposure.\n\nSure enough, the test revealed both tremolite and anthophyllite asbestos, two forms of the mineral confirmed to be in Johnson & Johnson's baby powder as well as its Shower to Shower product.\n\nCabibi had used both.\n\nIt's been some two years since her diagnosis, and treatment has kept her Cabibi alive.\n\nBut the average patient lives between just 12 and 22 months from diagnosis. The five-year survival rate is only four percent.\n\n'Nancy Cabibi is fighting to survive every single day because of asbestos in Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder,' said her attorney, David Greenstone, in a press release.\n\n'While we are very pleased with this verdict, we know that we must continue to fight on behalf of the Cabibis and so many others who have been harmed.'\n\n\n\nJohnson & Johnson had not replied to DailyMail.com's request for comment at the time of publication.", "description": "A California jury has awarded Nancy Cabibi, 71, over $40 million after alleging she developed mesothelioma from using Johnson & Johnson's baby powder, which contains the carcinogen, asbestos.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/01/17/19159380-0-image-a-3_1569946541532.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
