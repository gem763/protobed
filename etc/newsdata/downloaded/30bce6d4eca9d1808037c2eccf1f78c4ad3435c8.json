INTEREST COST COULD BE BROUGHT WAY DOWN.\u201d\n\nActually, it can\u2019t. Uncle Sam can\u2019t refinance its debt the way a homeowner\u2014or real estate developer\u2014might be able to. \u201cThe bottom line is, it won\u2019t work,\u201d says David Wilcox, a senior fellow at the Petersen Institute for International Economics and former head of research at the Federal Reserve. \u201cHow it works in the mortgage world and much of the corporate debt world is not how it works in the Treasury debt world.\u201d\n\nWhen interest rates fall, mortgage holders can normally refinance by taking out a new loan at a lower rate than the old loan, and using the proceeds to pay off the balance on the old loan. The borrower still owes the same amount, but with lower interest rates, monthly payments normally go down.\n\nMortgages are \u201ccallable\u201d debt that allows the borrower to pay off the balance before the loan comes to term, which for mortgages is commonly 30 years. That gives the borrower the flexibility to capitalize if interest rates fall. But that\u2019s a risk for the lender, which means mortgage rates are higher than they\u2019d be if they weren\u2019t callable, and the borrower was locked into paying the fixed rate for 30 years.\n\nDebt issued by the Treasury is not callable, which means the government does not have the right to repurchase its own securities at face value any time it wants. Treasuries are commonly traded on the secondary market, and the Treasury could buy its own securities at market prices. But this wouldn\u2019t save taxpayers any money, either.\n\nNo benefit for the taxpayer\n\nIf the government wanted to buy up Treasury securities paying higher rates, and pay for them by issuing new debt with lower rates, it would have to pay a premium for those securities on the secondary market. That\u2019s because the seller would be giving up a bond paying, say, 5% for 10 years, and only be able to use the proceeds for a bond paying, say 2%. Efficient markets would set the premium for the higher-interest bond equal to the interest savings from the lower-interest bond. So the Treasury would save on interest costs but pay the same amount in premiums to purchase the higher-interest debt. \u201cIt won\u2019t generate any benefit for the taxpayer,\u201d Wilcox says.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell walks to the podium during a news conference following a two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington, Wednesday, July 31, 2019.

But any borrower generally has to pay a higher interest rate for the right to repurchase the debt at any time. So if the Treasury did that, the government\u2019s borrowing costs would rise. And it wouldn\u2019t do anything to refinance debt it has already issued.\n\nTrump seems increasingly desperate to find some way to stimulate a slowing economy, with the 2020 presidential election now 14 months away. But he has already made decisions that are driving the national debt up rather than down. The tax cut he signed in 2017 is pushing annual deficits close to $1 trillion, in part because of a big dropoff in corporate tax revenue. Trump said the tax cuts would increase investment, economic activity and government revenues, but that hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nTrump has also amped up\u2014if that\u2019s possible\u2014his attacks on the Federal Reserve, by demanding a sharp cut in interest rates all the way to 0, and calling Fed policymakers \u201cboneheads.\u201d They\u2019re not boneheads, and it doesn\u2019t make sense to implement an aggressive, recession-style policy for an economy that\u2019s still doing okay. There are definitely boneheads elsewhere in Washington, though.\n\nRick Newman is the author of four books, including \u201cRebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman", "description": "He thinks the government can refinance the national debt like a mortgage.
