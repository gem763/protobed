REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage\n\nThe power cut knocked out traffic signals, forced school closures and shut businesses and government offices across northern and central California, according to Brian Ferguson, a spokesman for the state Office of Emergency Services.\n\nOne of the more noteworthy disruptions occurred at the University of California at Berkeley, which cancelled classes on Wednesday.\n\nA second phase of the \u201cpublic safety power shutoff,\u201d delayed until the evening, was due to extend power cuts to another 234,000 customers, the utility said, and it was considering a third phase for 42,000 more dwellings and businesses.\n\nThe action ultimately could leave nearly 800,000 homes and businesses, comprising millions of people, without electricity - the largest precautionary electricity shutoff undertaken by PG&E, California\u2019s biggest investor-owned utility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad that it is such a large area to be turned off,\u201d said Matthew Gallagher, a resident of Vacaville, a rural town 60 miles (100 km) northeast of San Francisco where everything from the local Walmart retail outlet to gasoline service stations were closed for lack of power.\n\nA similar cutoff was under consideration by neighbouring utility Southern California Edison for nearly 174,000 of its customers, about 50,000 of them in Los Angeles County, should severe winds hit Southern California on Thursday as forecast, SoCal Edison spokeswoman Taelor Bakewell said.\n\nSome of California\u2019s most devastating wildfires were sparked in recent years by damage to electrical transmission lines from recurring bouts of high winds that then spread the flames through tinder-dry vegetation into populated areas.\n\n\u201cWe are entering into a two-, three- or four-day period of extreme fire danger in California,\u201d Governor Gavin Newsom said at an event in San Diego on Wednesday.\n\n\u2018RED FLAG\u2019\n\nGale-force wind gusts, mostly in higher elevations, were expected to intensify late on Wednesday across northern and central California before gradually migrating into Southern California overnight and Thursday, National Weather Service meteorologist Steve Anderson said. He said extremely low humidity levels added to the fire threat.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said \u201cred-flag\u201d warnings were posted across the state for what was shaping up to be the strongest wind event so far this season.\n\nPG&E warned residents to prepare for outages that could last several days. But spokeswoman Kristi Jourdan said the utility expected to restore electricity to most customers within 24 to 48 hours after high winds abate, once power lines were inspected and any damage repaired.\n\nMany customers live in areas where breezes were light on Wednesday, but some are served by transmission lines hit by high winds elsewhere and thus were part of a larger portion of the grid that was turned off, PG&E spokesman Jeff Smith said.\n\nCustomers were urged to stock up on flashlights, fresh batteries, first-aid supplies and cash, and to plan for healthcare needs requiring refrigerated medications or electrical devices.\n\nThe utility said it opened 28 community centres across the planned outage zone to furnish restrooms, bottled water, battery charging and air-conditioned seating during daytime hours.\n\nPG&E has come under increased scrutiny in recent years over maintenance of transmission wires and other equipment implicated in major wildfires.\n\nIn May, state fire investigators determined that PG&E transmission lines caused the deadliest and most destructive wildfire on record in California, last year\u2019s wind-driven Camp Fire that killed 85 people in and around the town of Paradise.\n\nCal Fire likewise concluded that PG&E power lines had sparked a separate flurry of wildfires that swept California\u2019s wine country north of San Francisco Bay in 2017.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy in January 2019, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from the fires.", "description": "Electricity was shut off to more than 500,000 California homes and workplaces on Wednesday as Pacific Gas and Electric Co (PG&E) imposed a planned power outage of unprecedented scale to reduce wildfire risks posed by extremely windy, dry weather.", "authors": ["Steve Gorman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438981061&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981YR", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
