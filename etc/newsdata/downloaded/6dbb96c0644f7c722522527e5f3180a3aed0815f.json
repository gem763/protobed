Democrats have also voiced concern about Barr\u2019s ability to remain objective on matters that involve Ukraine, after the release of Trump\u2019s phone call in July with the country\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, mentioned Barr\u2019s involvement. That call, in which Trump said that Barr and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani would contact Zelensky, prompted a whistleblower\u2019s complaint that is at the center of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\nReports by The Washington Post and The New York Times also found that Barr was meeting with foreign officials to get assistance with the Durham investigation.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a leader of the impeachment inquiry, said on Sunday that the attorney general \u201cis weaponizing the Justice Department to go after the president\u2019s enemies.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s demonstrating once again that he is merely a tool of the president, the president\u2019s hand, not the representative of the American people,\u201d Schiff said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week With George Stephanopoulos.\u201d\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Schiff also released a joint statement on Oct. 24 regarding the escalation of the Justice Department\u2019s investigation, noting that the department \u201chas lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump\u2019s political revenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution, or to help the President with a political narrative for the next election,\u201d the statement said, \u201cthe rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c0/dd/6dc700de414ca7d7b49032b9d832/191028-william-barr-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
