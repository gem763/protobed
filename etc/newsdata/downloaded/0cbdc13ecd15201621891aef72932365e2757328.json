Maybe.", "language": "en", "text": "So far, the results are varied. Some studies report that pregnancy and childbirth dramatically accelerate aging in women at the cellular level. Other research, though, suggests that motherhood and pregnancy may slow down the aging process.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese types of contradictions are bound to be found during the early stages of research, said Dan Eisenberg, a biological anthropologist at the University of Washington, who does work in the area.\n\n\u201cAny single study could be wrong even when the scientists are doing everything right,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of the way that science works is that people look at similar questions all around the world. Then we combine those studies to look at trends and narrow in on what is true.\u201d\n\nLast year, Eisenberg and his colleagues published a paper in the journal Scientific Reports, which found that with each pregnancy a mother\u2019s telomeres appear to be about four months to four years older than those of her peers without children.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEisenberg\u2019s study was conducted on over 800 women in their early 20s in Cebu, Philippines. Roughly 60 percent never had children. The remaining had given birth to one or more children.\n\nThe study also looked at the epigenetic age of women, a measurement taken by looking at DNA extracted from white blood cells. By studying the population of cells in the DNA, researchers can determine a person\u2019s epigenetic age. The results were similar to what the telomeres indicated: The more pregnancies a woman went through, the \u201colder\u201d her epigenetic age.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThese are very young women though. We don\u2019t know if this effect persists as they get older. Maybe they just bounce back over time,\u201d said Calen Ryan, a biological anthropologist at Northwestern University who led the epigenetics portion of the same study.\n\nParadoxically, Ryan, Eisenberg and their colleagues found that if a woman was pregnant at the time the measurements were taken, she looked epigenetically \u201cyounger\u201d than expected. However, they did not find the same effect when they looked at telomere length.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhy would a woman look epigenetically younger during a pregnancy and epigenetically older after multiple pregnancies?\u201d Ryan said. \u201cCould it be that mom\u2019s blood is getting contaminated with baby\u2019s blood, or cells of baby\u2019s blood, and if so is this an artifact of that? These are things we need to understand.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEisenberg is involved in a new study looking at this, known scientifically as microchimerism, in a subset of the same population of women he previously studied in the Philippines. He would also like to analyze telomere length in women before and after pregnancy, to see how it changes.\n\nSome of the results his team is finding could be specific to the population in the Philippines, where mothers are younger and fertility rates are higher than in the United States, he said.\n\n\u201cWe tend to have better health care and better access to health care and less infectious disease\u201d in the United States, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fully clear whether we\u2019ll see this as clearly in other populations.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt least one study on telomere length of American women has found results along the lines of what Eisenberg and Ryan found. Published in the journal Human Reproduction, the study relied on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and looked at telomere length in nearly 2,000 American women between the ages of 20 and 44. The researchers found that women who had live births had telomeres that were an average of 4.2 percent shorter than their counterparts with no children.\n\nThis equates to around 11 years of accelerated cellular aging, said Anna Pollack, an epidemiologist at George Mason University and the lead researcher of the study. Strikingly, this decrease in telomere length is greater than what researchers have previously found in people who smoke cigarettes or have a high body mass index.\n\n\u201cIt was surprising to me that we found such a strong association,\u201d Pollack said. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is exactly when the shortening occurs,\u201d she added. \u201cIs it that first year when you\u2019re the parent of an infant and you\u2019re never sleeping? And is it due to a lack of social support?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPablo Nepomnaschy, an epidemiologist at Simon Fraser University thinks that the amount of social support a mother gets might be a factor, based on his finding that indigenous women in Guatemala with children actually had longer telomeres than those without. His study, published in PLOS One in 2016, looked at 75 women from two neighboring rural communities and measured telomere length at two points over 13 years.\n\n\u201cIn this indigenous Mayan society in Guatemala, children are seen as Godsends, as blessings,\u201d Nepomnaschy said. \u201cWomen were expected, until recently, to have many children and in fact, there may be a lot of stress associated with not having children in that society.\u201d\n\nThe Guatemalan women help raise one another\u2019s children, and often the oldest daughter in the family helps care for the younger ones. That sort of extensive support structure is not something many American women have, he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is purely hypothesis, he said, but the community support may reduce stress levels in mothers and result in increased telomere length. It could also help explain the discrepancy between his findings and the other studies.\n\nThe increased telomere length could also be due to the dramatic increase in estrogen in women who are pregnant, Nepomnaschy said. Estrogen may serve as an antioxidant that prevents the shortening of telomeres. \u201cWhen you are pregnant your estrogen levels rise up,\u201d he said. \u201cThose prolonged periods of estrogen exposure may be protecting women against aging.\u201d\n\nThere is also other research, relying on data collected by the UK Biobank and based on neuroimaging, which suggests that the more live births a woman has, the \u201cyounger-looking\u201d her brain looks. Results from the study are available on the UK Biobank website, but have not yet appeared in a peer-reviewed publication.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEisenberg said that while he thinks it is more likely than not that pregnancy and childbirth do result in some sort of accelerated aging, he doesn\u2019t think it is something to worry about.\n\n\u201cPeople take risks in life, and there are a lot of reasons people want to have children,\u201d he said. \u201cWe already know that gestating a child and taking care of a child is very difficult \u2014 but also very worthwhile. Even if it is true, that there is a bit of acceleration of aging as a result of children, it doesn\u2019t mean people wouldn\u2019t want to have children.\u201d", "description": "Researchers home in on how having a baby affects a key biological marker.", "authors": ["Sindya Bhanoo"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vAYgMBwTYrNIgpwgih2zd_SdoRQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3NU32OXRFQI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
