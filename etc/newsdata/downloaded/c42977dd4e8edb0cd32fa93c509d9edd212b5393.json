It can hide a number of objects including army vehicles and ships.\n\nVideo footage shows these two miniature tanks being covered with the material\n\nIt can work in any environment, and is able to perform well any time of the day or night.\n\nThe company has also filed three other patents, one of which could allow for aircraft detection and tracking.\n\nLaser Scattering, Deviation & Manipulation technology has been developed which can split a single laser into over 3,888,000 smaller lasers.\n\nWith this many lasers you are able to create a system of lasers that behave like radars, which typically use one laser, a spinning mirror and an optical receiver to determine the surroundings.\n\nThese are often found on self-driving vehicles and these lasers should allow for ultra-high resolution at longer distances, allowing computers to identify dangerous objects.\n\nEarlier this year it was reported that the US government had spent millions researching invisibility cloaks, as well as laser-powered weapons in a top secret programme.\n\nIn January declassified papers emerged which revealed the US government spent tax-payers' money researching science fiction concepts.\n\nThese include using stable wormholes to travel to other parts of space, invisibility cloaking, warp drive and high energy laser weapons.\n\nThe Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) released the list in response to a freedom of information request.\n\nDeclassified documents containing the remarkable details of 38 secret government funded projects have now been made public.", "description": "The material, which was created by Canada-based camouflage company Hyperstealth, could be used to hide large items such as army tanks or even to shield troops on the ground from enemies.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/16/19795010-0-image-a-12_1571240270135.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
