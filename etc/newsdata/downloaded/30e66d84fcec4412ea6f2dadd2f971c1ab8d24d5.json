Oh, that\u2019s a shame.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid I hear Shepard Smith is leaving?\u201d the president asked, soundly almost gleeful. \u201cIs he leaving because of bad ratings? He had terrible ratings, is he leaving because of his ratings? If he\u2019s leaving, I assume he\u2019s leaving because he had bad ratings.\u201d\n\nSmith, who has been the rare critical voice against the president on Fox, announced on Friday that he had requested to get out of his contract on leave the network, effective immediately. \u201cEven in our currently polarized nation, it\u2019s my hope that the facts will win the day,\u201d Smith said in his final broadcast. \u201cThat the truth will always matter, that journalism and journalists will thrive.\u201d\n\nThe move comes just two days after Attorney General Bill Barr met privately with Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch, prompting some speculation that the Trump administration had something to do with Smith\u2019s exit.\n\n\u201cWell, I wish him well,\u201d Trump concluded. \u201cI wish Shepard Smith well.\u201d\n\nSources close to the president told The Daily Beast they doubt he actually meant those last two sentences. After all, Trump has long attacked Smith in public.\n\nOne of the earlier hate-tweets Trump sent against the now-former Fox News host was posted in November 2015, five months after the reality-TV star turned Republican icon launched his presidential bid. \u201cBoy is this guy @ShepNewsTeam tough on me. So totally biased. As a reporter, he should be ashamed of himself! #Trump2016,\u201d the @realDonaldTrump tweet read.\n\nIn the West Wing, it has long been a common occurrence for officials to hear the notably media-obsessed president complain about Smith. \u201cThere is absolutely no way the president is not gleeful about Shep leaving,\u201d said a senior administration official who has talked to Trump many times about media figures the president despises.\n\nIn recent months, Trump has been asking those close to him, including friends who work at Fox, one particularly leading leading question about the conservative media giant: \u201cWhat the hell is going on at Fox?\" as The Daily Beast reported in late July.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been good to them,\u201d a somewhat bewildered Trump remarked to one confidant this past summer, adding that he was noticing too many hosts and on-air contributors on his favorite channel being \u201cunfair\u201d to him.\n\nAnd when the president grouses about this topic, he frequently cites Smith as one of the greatest offenders in this regard, according to multiple sources who talk regularly to Trump. One of these sources said the president has made a point of privately grumbling about Smith\u2019s recent coverage of Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal\u2014coverage and dissections of what Smith dubbed the \u201cbaseless\u201d \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d that Team Trump and other Fox hosts were aggressively pushing on Ukraine and the Bidens.\n\nHeaded into the long weekend, various Trump associates and diehards weren\u2019t shy about dancing on Smith\u2019s Fox News grave. Sebastian Gorka, a former White House official and current friend of the president\u2019s, posted to Instagram on Friday: \u201cShep Smith is leaving @foxnews. He will not be missed by those who love America and the Truth.\u201d (Gorka used to work at Fox, as well, where \u201chard news\u201d shows, such as Smith\u2019s, had a \u201csoft ban\u201d on Gorka, in large part because Fox\u2019s news division widely saw the former Trump aide as, to put it mildly, insufficiently credible.)", "description": "The president appeared to learn that his least-favorite Fox News host had quit from a reporter on Friday afternoon.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Asawin Suebsaeng", "Senior Writer", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570830565/DT_ruudvk", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
