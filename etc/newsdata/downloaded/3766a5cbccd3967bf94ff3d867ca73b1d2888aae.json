But the \"Hollaback Girl\" singer would like her boyfriend to experience fathering his own child as well! \"Gwen sees how great Blake is to her kids and dreams about making him a father,\" a source close to the couple EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife. But turning dreams into reality requires the couple to look at logistics.\n\n\"It is been back and forth on adding to her family for a multitude of reasons including her age, if they want to adopt and a few other variables,\" our source reveals. So, baby No. 4 isn't a guarantee for Gwen, but that's not bad news. \"If they don't add to the family she knows that he is so good to her current children and will be an amazing stepfather once they eventually get married,\" our insider explains.
