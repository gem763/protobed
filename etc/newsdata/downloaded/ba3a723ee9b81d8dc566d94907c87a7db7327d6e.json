Ator was charged in 2001 with criminal trespass and evading arrest, according to Heavy.com.\n\nChristopher Combs, FBI special agent in charge, said that local and state law enforcement were the \u201ctrue heroes,\u201d chasing down the shooter and before he could reach a popular movie theater in Odessa.\n\n\u201cIn the midst of a man driving down the highway shooting at people, local law enforcement and state troopers pursued him and stopped him from possibly going into a crowded movie theater and having another event of mass violence,\u201d said Mr. Combs at the press event. \u201cI think that\u2019s the story of law enforcement that should be conveyed.\u201d\n\nThe death toll climbed Sunday to seven people, plus the gunman, as police investigated more than 15 crime scenes and the FBI executive a search warrant at a home in West Odessa.\n\nSEE ALSO: Authorities probe background of Odessa shooting suspect for motive to rampage\n\nAt the press conference, Odessa Police Chief Michael Gerke refused to say the name of the deceased gunman, saying \u201cI\u2019m not going to give him any notoriety for what he did.\u201d\n\nThe seven people killed by the shooter ranged in age from 15 to 57. Another 19 people were injured, including a 17-month-old who was hit by shrapnel in the mouth and chest, according to a text from the child\u2019s mother read by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\n\u201cToddlers are funny because they can get shot but still want to run around and play,\u201d Mr. Abbott continued, reading the mother\u2019s text.\n\nAmong the dead was postal worker Mary Granados, whose van was hijacked by the shooter, and a student in the Ector County Independent School District. Three law enforcement officers shot in the melee were in stable condition, according to TV station KOSA, the CBS affiliate in the Midland-Odessa area.\n\nThe governor praised the \u201crobust and heroic response\u201d from law enforcement officers working to \u201cbring the gunman down and to quickly de-escalate the challenge, and to literally save lives.\u201d\n\nMr. Abbott, a Republican, also vowed to take action against the mass shootings that have hit Texas especially hard in the last few years, most recently with the El Paso Walmart massacre in August, which left 22 people dead and 24 injured.\n\n\u201cWe are here today, and we will be here every day until this community is pieced back together,\u201d Mr. Abbott said. \u201cBut we know that words alone are inadequate. Words must be met with action.\u201d\n\nWhile he said he has signed more than 15 bills to prevent school shootings, Mr. Abbott declared that the \u201cstatus quo in Texas is unacceptable,\u201d and that his administration has been working since the El Paso shooting on possible executive and legislative solutions.\n\n\u201cNow in the aftermath of this shooting, and the unique aspects of this shooting, we must broaden our efforts to address tragedy that has befallen Odessa,\u201d Mr. Abbott said. \u201cAnd we must do so quickly. We need solutions that will keep guns out of the hands of criminals like the killer here in Odessa while also ensuring that we safeguard Second Amendment rights. And we must do it fast.\u201d\n\nRep. Tom Craddick, Texas Republican, told the Midland Reporter-Telegram that the suspect had previously failed a background check.\n\nPresident Trump also praised Sunday the \u201cincredible job\u201d of law enforcement and first responders.\n\nThe gunman opened fire on state troopers after being pulled over in Midland, Texas, for what appeared to be a routine traffic stop for failing to signal, shooting randomly at locals before abandoning his vehicle and hijacking a postal truck on his way to the Cinergy Cinemas.\n\n\u201cPlease understand that on a Saturday in Odessa, Texas, that is one of the most crowded places to be,\u201d Chief Gerke said.\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan described such \u201cdevastating\u201d mass shootings as a \u201chomeland security threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey absolutely are a homeland security threat,\u201d said Mr. McAleenan on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cIn our counterterrorism strategy and approach, domestic terrorism has taken a frontline focus for us.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
