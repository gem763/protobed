As Cardinal Michael Czerny said at the Vatican press briefing about the final document, \u201cWe cannot keep repeating old responses to urgent problems and expect to get better results.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe lack of women\u2019s official and equal recognition in the Church is an urgent problem that receives recycled responses with insufficient results. The ordination of older married men is not a solution, but a measure that further marginalizes the vocations and gifts of women.\n\n\n\nAmong the incremental steps for women outlined in the synod document, one recommendation included was that a woman could be entrusted by her bishop to perform ecclesial functions. If women can be entrusted with ecclesial functions \u2014 as they should be \u2014 it is absurd to suggest that they cannot be entrusted with ordained ministry.\n\n\n\nIn the spirit of conversion called for in the synod document, we urge the hierarchy to be unafraid of pursuing a new path that empowers women as equals.\n\n\n\nWomen are the vanguard of the Church, finding a way in seemingly impossible situations. Women are the vanguard of the environmental movement, who recognize that when the environment suffers, it is women and children \u2014 especially those who are poor \u2014 who suffer most.\n\n\n\nNow is the time for the Church to not just recognize women\u2019s leadership, but transform its institutions to honor their leadership sacramentally. The crises in our world and our Church deserve nothing less.\n\n\n\nContact: Kate McElwee, Executive Director\n\nkmcelwee@womensordination.org", "description": "Women's Ordination Conference works for women's ordination as priests and bishops into a renewed priesthood in the Roman Catholic Church.", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
