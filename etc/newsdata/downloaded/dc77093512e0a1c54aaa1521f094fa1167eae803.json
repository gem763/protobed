(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 Dwayne Haskins strode to the podium in the bowels of MetLife stadium after making his NFL regular season debut Sunday and appeared slightly annoyed. He banged a bottle of water on the wood structure a couple times without anywhere to put it, and his thumb anxiously tapped the lectern.\n\nThis was a moment he had waited for since childhood, but it wasn\u2019t a happy one. The Redskins were throttled, 24-3, by the division rival New York Giants, the team he grew up admiring, and the subpar performance of starter Case Keenum necessitated Haskins\u2019 NFL initiation. Yes, the 15th overall pick wants to play, but he doesn\u2019t wish ill will toward Keenum. And the rookie certainly doesn\u2019t want to lose games, regardless of how he gains his opportunities.\n\n\u201cI had a whole bunch of emotions in my head,\u201d Haskins said. \u201cI just wanted to win the game, and we didn\u2019t. It is what it is. On to the next week. \u2026 I hate losing, I really do. We\u2019re going to keep getting better, and that\u2019s not happening again.\u201d\n\nThe question becomes when Haskins will get his next opportunity, as Coach Jay Gruden was unwilling to name a starter for next week\u2019s game against the New England Patriots after the loss.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll worry about tomorrow, tomorrow,\u201d Gruden said brusquely. \u201cThen I\u2019ll reevaluate everything. \u2026 He\u2019s got to earn that right [to start] first. I don\u2019t care where you\u2019re drafted, when you\u2019re drafted, you need to earn that. He\u2019s got to come in here and perform when he\u2019s asked to perform. If I feel like he gives us the best chance to win against New England, I\u2019ll put him in there. \u2026 You\u2019re just not handed the keys because of where you\u2019re drafted.\u201d\n\n[The key moments from Redskins' 24-3 loss to the Giants]\n\nHaskins was drafted to be the future franchise quarterback, but no one knew when that day would come. He competed for the starting job in training camp but clearly wasn\u2019t ready to be the opening-week starter. Fans called for Haskins to start as the team fell to 0-3, particularly with other first-round quarterbacks, such as Daniel Jones of the Giants, starting throughout the league, but Gruden resisted.\n\nAfter Keenum struggled early Sunday \u2014 including overthrowing a wide-open Trey Quinn for a potential touchdown on the first snap of the game and throwing an interception two plays later \u2014 Gruden relented and went to his young signal-caller.\n\nOffensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell had given Haskins a warning early in the second quarter that his time may be coming, and he injected some life into the offense upon entering the game. He connected on his first two passes, including a third-down conversion, and his 14-yard scramble set up first-and-goal from the one-yard line. Haskins nearly had his first touchdown pass, but he threw wide and outside to an open Vernon Davis on third down, and the team settled for a field goal.\n\nHe struggled in the second half, as the team was shut out, and he finished 9 for 17 passing with 107 yards and three interceptions. He was sacked twice.\n\n\u201cI thought he did provide a spark,\u201d running back Adrian Peterson said. \u201cHe came in and did a good job. Of course, he had interceptions, but that\u2019s things he can tweak. \u2026 Of course things could have been better.\u201d\n\nGruden will now have to decide whether he wants to switch to Haskins on a full-time basis and give him the first-team reps in practice. The coach also has the option of going back to Keenum, or calling upon Colt McCoy. The veteran returned to practice last week after dealing with complications stemming from last season\u2019s broken leg, and is expected to be healthy enough to play against the Patriots.\n\nThe 22-year-old Haskins did have some positives, including showing some good mobility and earning praise from Gruden for his pocket presence, but there\u2019s plenty he needs to improve.\n\n\u201cI just knew that my time would be coming and when the day comes, that I\u2019d be ready for it,\u201d Haskins said. \u201cI didn\u2019t execute the way I wanted to, but the good thing about it is that it hurts, and there [are] going to be brighter days tomorrow. \u2026 I want to win. I\u2019m going to win. Whatever it takes to win, we will do that. \u2026 We\u2019re going to change that and win some games. I\u2019ll be here for a while, so get used to seeing me smile up here.\u201d\n\nRead more NFL coverage:\n\nThe Browns kept the Ravens from running away with the AFC North\n\nVontaze Burfict ejected for late, helmet-to-helmet to hit\n\nFor better or worse: Two Bills fans got married at halftime on the 50-yard line", "description": "Washington\u2019s first-round pick was intercepted three times during Sunday\u2019s loss to the Giants.
