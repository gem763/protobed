In letters obtained by The Verge, the Biden campaign pleads with Facebook and Twitter to block these advertisements:\n\nNo company should allow itself to be a tool to mislead the public on any issue, let alone on one as important as the health of our democracy. It is one thing to allow President Trump the platform to spread falsehoods from his own account; it is quite another to profit from paid ads echoing the same lies. We ask that you make that distinction \u2014 between the personal account of a politician and paid advertising content \u2014 just as Twitter does in every other context.\n\nEarlier this week, Facebook responded to a similar request from Biden\u2019s team and flat-out rejected the idea of banning misleading ads.\n\n\u201cOur approach is grounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is,\u201d Katie Harbath, Facebook\u2019s public policy director for global elections, wrote in a response letter. \u201cThus, when a politician speaks or makes an ad, we do not send it to third party fact checkers.\u201d", "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign sent a letter to Twitter Wednesday, asking that the platform reject any political ads placed by Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign that are found to be misleading or false.
