Last week it voted unanimously to brand the National Rifle Association, an association with millions of American members, a \u201cdomestic terrorist organization.\u201d\n\nLaw books have plenty to say on the definition of terrorism, but the supervisors don\u2019t seem to have cracked one. Instead they suggest terrorism occurs anytime someone uses a \u201cweapon\u201d to threaten others\u2019 personal safety or \u201csubstantial\u201d property damage. They try to attribute this view to the U.S. Justice Department, ignoring all the other elements that distinguish terrorism from other types of armed crime, such as that criminal acts be used to intimidate or coerce a civilian population or government target.\n\nAn even greater problem for the supervisors is that the NRA and its members are generally law-abiding. The resolution therefore claims that even otherwise lawful acts\u2014such as training or providing funds\u2014that assists or enables someone you should have known might misuse weapons constitutes \u201cmaterial support.\u201d That includes the NRA\u2019s \u201cadvocacy,\u201d \u201cpropaganda\u201d and \u201cpromotion\u201d both of gun ownership and of \u201cextremist positions.\u201d In a word, speech. Thus the supervisors purport to classify as terrorism the expression of opinions with which they disagree.\n\nThe resolution is mostly symbolic, but it does order city officials to \u201ctake every reasonable step to limit those entities who do business with the City and County of San Francisco from doing business with\u201d the NRA. That\u2019s almost certainly unconstitutional. In Board of County Commissioners v. Umbehr (1996), the Supreme Court held that terminating a contract in response to the contractor\u2019s protected speech violates the First Amendment. The vote was 7-2, with only Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissenting.\n\nThe general issue has been in the news in recent years because of cities\u2019 moves to keep conservative-owned businesses like Chick-fil-A from getting concessions in airports and similar facilities, or even in one case from obtaining routine permits. Last month a federal judge allowed the NRA to proceed with a lawsuit challenging a less extreme Los Angeles ordinance that requires city contractors to disclose (but not discontinue) their associations with the gun group. The judge ruled that in the context of the NRA\u2019s First Amendment claims, even commercial ties such as discount partnerships could be construed as \u201cexpression.\u201d\n\nA couple of weeks before passing the NRA resolution, the San Francisco supervisors passed a nonbinding measure encouraging municipal officials to use \u201cpeople-first language\u201d when speaking of those with criminal records. That means using \u201cneutral, objective, and non-pejorative language,\u201d such as \u201ccurrently incarcerated person\u201d or \u201cyoung person impacted by the justice system.\u201d Using words like \u201cconvict\u201d or \u201cdelinquent,\u201d according to the resolution, \u201cundermines, devalues, dehumanizes, demoralizes and dishonors the humanity of [the] individual.\u201d\n\nThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors would never want to do something like that\u2014except to an individual who holds views they find uncongenial.\n\nMr. Olson is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute.", "description": "San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors plays language games to smear the National Rifle Association.", "authors": ["Walter Olson"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104904/social", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
