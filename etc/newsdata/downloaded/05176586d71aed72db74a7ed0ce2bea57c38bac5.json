But Trump often doesn\u2019t know his civics well enough to recognize his violations, and he doesn\u2019t have any shame. Shame is a concern for other people\u2019s opinions, and his is limited. Throughout his career he\u2019s done things that other people might have avoided to avoid public disapprobation\u2014breaking a promise to save friezes from the old Bonwit Teller building, stiffing contractors, and even lying to federal and state regulators\u2014on the assumption that the consequences would be minor. That assumption was generally right. It also meant \u201cgrabbing [women] by the pussy,\u201d recognizing\u2014again, correctly\u2014that he was unlikely to face serious consequences.\n\nNaturally, this approach carried over into the presidential campaign, where Trump was willing to say things that other candidates were not. Other Republicans had been happy to play on voters\u2019 racism and xenophobia, as long as it was hidden behind enough euphemism. Trump was willing to state it plainly, and Republican voters rewarded him for it. As the general election progressed, Trump recognized that many voters were turned off or even appalled by his gaucheness. \u201cIf you really like Donald Trump, that's great, but if you don\u2019t, you have to vote for me anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know why? Supreme Court judges, Supreme Court judges. Have no choice, sorry, sorry, sorry. You have no choice.\u201d\n\nIn effect, Trump wagered that actions were more important than words. He won. Even though 60 percent of voters had an unfavorable opinion of Trump, and a similar number said he was not qualified to be president, according to exit polls, enough of them voted for Trump for him to win an electoral-college victory with a minority of the vote. The president has stuck with this approach in his post-election political strategy, adopting a base-centered strategy and making little serious attempt to mitigate his consistently dismal approval rating.\n\nRead: The many scandals of Donald Trump: a cheat sheet\n\nWhen Trump was elected, many of his critics feared that he\u2019d create acute constitutional crises by doing things like defying federal-court orders. As president, he\u2019s been heavily involved in litigation\u2014both as a defendant, in challenges to executive moves, and as a plaintiff, challenging House Democrats\u2019 oversight\u2014but he has not dared defy a court. The consequences could be too grave.\n\nIn the field of foreign policy, however, there are fewer restrictions on what a president can do. Neither courts nor Congress are likely to intervene. Trump has been happy to fight rhetorical battles around the globe. But when confrontations threaten to have irreversible consequences, he has often backed down. When it became clear that verbal pressure alone would not dislodge Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, Trump lost interest in that conflict. When he realized that 150 people might die, Trump canceled an airstrike on Iran.", "description": "Only the fear of consequences restrains the president.", "authors": ["David A.
