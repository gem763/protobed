But a public hearing before lawmakers would give Democratic presidential candidates on the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2014 Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) \u2014 an opportunity to question him.\n\nGiuliani has spent months pressing Ukraine's leaders to open an investigation into baseless allegations that Biden engineered the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating an energy company with ties to his son, Hunter Biden. The prosecutor, in fact, had been viewed by the international community as an impediment to investigating corruption and Biden's efforts to have him removed were done in coordination with other Western governments.\n\nTrump has echoed Giuliani's allegations about Biden and raised the issue in a July 25 phone call with Ukraine's new president Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 a discussion that occurred amid Giuliani's pressure campaign and at a time the White House had quietly placed a hold on military assistance to Ukraine, which was eventually released after news of the hold became public.\n\nTrump has tried to turn the discussion in Washington away from his efforts to pressure Zelensky and toward Biden.\n\nIt's unclear if Giuliani will accept Graham's offer to testify. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ed/82/99b8c36a4ba2b1f1ed5e7c8e301e/190208-lindsey-graham-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
