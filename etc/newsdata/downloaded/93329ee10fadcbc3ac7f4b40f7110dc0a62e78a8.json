Cory Booker (D-NJ) asked questions about Breitbart News during a press conference Wednesday at the National Press Club in Washington, DC, saying he didn\u2019t know who Andrew Breitbart was but that it was \u201cfantastic\u201d that the founder of Breitbart News was a pioneer of citizen journalism.\n\nDuring the question and answer portion of the press conference, Breitbart News asked about the outrage from Democrats and even some Republicans over President Donald Trump comparing the Democrats\u2019 ongoing behind-closed-doors impeachment investigation to a political lynching.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Democrats have used the term many times, including during the impeachment of Bill Clinton and as recently concerning the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s scandals while serving as secretary of state.\n\nBreitbart News asked Booker about the double standard, but the senator, who held the press conference as part of his campaign to win the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination, inquired about Breitbart News, which led to the following exchange:\n\n\u201cWhat is this Bart that is bright? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard of it,\u201d Booker said.\n\nThe Breitbart News reporter explained it was named after the founder of Breitbart News, Andrew Breitbart.\n\n\u201cOh really? I didn\u2019t know that,\u201d Booker said. \u201cAnd who was Andrew?\u201d\n\nThe reporter explained that Breitbart was a pioneer in citizen journalism.\n\n\u201cOh that\u2019s fantastic,\u201d Booker said.\n\nBut when Breitbart News asked the lynching question, Booker was no longer in a jovial mood.\n\n\u201cReally quickly back to the lynching question. Since Trump tweeted, there\u2019s been a lot of outrage expressed. There\u2019s also been a lot of reporting on Democrats that have used that term over and over, when Bill Clinton was being impeached and other times. Can you comment on that?\u201d Breitbart News asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you know this, but there have been a lot of Democratic racists in the past,\u201d Booker said.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m not talking about people who have used that word in recent history. I\u2019m going back to George Wallace and the like. And if every time we call out Donald Trump for behavior and the first response is, \u2018Look at the Democrat,\u2019 that\u2019s not gonna solve the problem,\u201d Booker said.\n\n\u201cHe is the president of the United States of America. Words matter. And excusing him because some Democrat used the same word?\u201d Booker said.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t taught those morals on the playground for crying out loud. Leadership is about accepting responsibility for your actions. And he uses language that divides, demeans, and degrades on a regular basis,\u201d Booker said.\n\n\u201cHave Democrats used language that divide, demean, and degrade? Yeah.\u201d Booker said.\n\n\u201cBut he is the president of the United States. And so do I have a level of accountability for him?\u201d Booker said. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd at a time when people are trying to score political points by dividing us along racial lines. At a time that I have journalists come up to me and tell me about their spouse \u2014 this one journalist said to me that their spouse was crying the other day because they\u2019re afraid to speak Spanish in public,\u201d Booker said.\n\n\u201cAt a time that a president can\u2019t condemn white supremacists or even say at a time that the majority of our terrorist attacks since 9/11 have been right-wing terrorist attacks, the majority of them white supremacy attacks. And our president isn\u2019t willing to recognize that as a problem?\u201d Booker continued.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, Trump has emphatically and repeatedly denounced right-wing and white supremacist violence.\n\n\u201cIt should hurt every American \u2014 Democrat or Republican \u2014 that we\u2019re tearing each other apart, tearing each other down,\u201d Booker said.\n\n\u201cThis president is complicit; this president is responsible; this president is adding to a climate that\u2019s not only dangerous and creating less safety in our country, but he is inciting division and hate,\u201d Booker said.\n\n\u201cSo don\u2019t point out to me as an excuse for his behavior other Democrats. This is a moment where we need some sacred honor,\u201d Booker said.\n\n\u201cGod, you know what? We need a new president. And I\u2019m going to tell you this. Because I know some of my Republican colleagues who are so honorable. Who find his words repugnant,\u201d Booker said.\n\n\u201cThere were people who were willing to say it yesterday, that he used the wrong words. They understand the damage that it causes,\u201d Booker said.\n\n\u201cAmerica \u2014 we are tearing each other apart. And as a guy that has privilege to read classified documents. The last time I went to the SCIFs [Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities] in the Senate \u2014 you know what I was reading? I was reading intelligence reports about what the Russians are doing to undermine our republic,\u201d Booker said.\n\n\u201cAnd God I wish I could have ripped a couple pages out and brought them into the public. Because one of their strategies \u2014 I saw in detail \u2014 is to make us hate each other, is to pour gasoline on the lines that divide and hope they tear us apart,\u201d Booker said.\n\n\u201cI hear echoes [of] Khrushchev, who said that this country would not take us down tank for tank, or battleship for battleship,\u201d Booker said referring to the former Soviet Union-era dictator, Nikita Khrushchev. \u201cHis theory was that America would crumple from within.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we have a president right now who is making those words more real and scary than they\u2019ve ever been in my lifetime,\u201d Booker said.\n\n\u201cRepublicans and Democrats, we know better than this. And we can\u2019t allow it or excuse it, or else we are complicit in that as well,\u201d Booker said.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter.", "description": "Sen.
