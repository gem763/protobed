The Springboks were victorious when the two sides met in Wellington this time last year.\n\nThat means New Zealand are way of the threat posed by coach Rassie Erasmus\u2019 team and are looking at the match more as a standalone contest than a World Cup tone setter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a heightened state always when we play South Africa,\u201d said Foster. \u201cI know the World Cup is big but I guess our focus has been on this game for a while.\u201d", "description": "New Zealand are focusing all their energy on the World Cup opener against South Africa on Saturday with coaches happy to have their most challenging match of the pool stages first up.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430788854&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0NZ", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
