REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo\n\nBRUSSELS/BERLIN (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization cut its forecast for growth in global trade this year by more than half on Tuesday and said further rounds of tariffs and retaliation, a slowing economy and a disorderly Brexit could squeeze it even more.\n\nThe WTO said it now expected global merchandise trade to increase by 1.2% this year, compared with its April estimate of 2.6%. That growth was 3.0% in 2018. For 2020, growth 2.7% is forecast, down from a previous estimate of 3.0%.\n\n\u201cThe darkening outlook for trade is discouraging, but not unexpected,\u201d WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo said in a statement, urging WTO members to resolve trade disagreements and cooperate to reform the WTO.\n\nThe Geneva-based body said its reduced forecasts reflected estimates for slower expansion of the global economy, partly due to trade tensions, but also because of cyclical and structural factors and, in Europe, Brexit-related uncertainty.\n\nThe WTO gave a forecast range for trade growth this year of 0.5% to 1.6% and for 2020 of 1.7% to 3.7%, with the upper end of the ranges reachable if trade tensions eased.\n\n\u201cRisks to the forecast are heavily weighted to the downside and dominated by trade policy,\u201d the WTO said.\n\nThe United States and China have been locked in a trade war for over a year. They have levied punitive duties on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other\u2019s goods, roiling financial markets and threatening global growth.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has also imposed tariffs on products from other countries, notably on steel and aluminum, in a bid to cut the trade deficit of the world\u2019s largest economy. The WTO figures implied he had had limited success.\n\nThe WTO said on Tuesday that North America showed the fastest growth of exports of any region in the first half of the year, at 1.4%, although the rise of imports into North America were also greater than elsewhere, at 1.8%.", "description": "The World Trade Organization cut its forecast for growth in global trade this year by more than half on Tuesday and said further rounds of tariffs and retaliation, a slowing economy and a disorderly Brexit could squeeze it even more.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435829229&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902EM", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
