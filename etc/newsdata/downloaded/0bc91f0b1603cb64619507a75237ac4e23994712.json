Photo: Getty Images\n\nOn Friday, former Desperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman was sentenced to 14 days in prison for her role in the nationwide college-admissions scandal. The day was described as \u201crough\u201d \u2014 not for Huffman, but for former Full House star Lori Loughlin, who was reportedly \u201cpaying close attention to the proceedings,\u201d a source told People.\n\nBoth Huffman and Loughlin were implicated in the FBI\u2019s Operation Varsity Blues, which uncovered the nationwide scandal earlier this year in which dozens of wealthy parents were alleged to have paid William \u201cRick\u201d Singer thousands of dollars to facilitate their children\u2019s entry into prestigious colleges. In May, Huffman pleaded guilty to paying Singer $15,000 to falsify her daughter\u2019s SAT scores. Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Gianulli, are accused of paying Singer $500,000 to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as crew recruits \u2014 neither rows crew \u2014 but unlike Huffman, in April, Loughlin rejected a plea deal and pleaded not guilty to the charges against her. This is a decision she is reportedly starting to regret.\n\n\u201cIf she\u2019s found guilty, she will go to jail; that is clear. And if another deal is offered to her, which I don\u2019t think it will be, she will go to jail. Her only chance of avoiding jail is to beat these charges,\u201d the source told People. \u201cShe didn\u2019t understand the entire nature of the charges against her, and she wasn\u2019t even sure if or how she had broken the law. It was very early, and she didn\u2019t have all the information that she has now.\u201d\n\nThe source added that Loughlin hopes the \u201cprosecution will move fairly and not make an example out of her.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has been a rough day. Lori is going to move forward as best as she can, but now she has a little more clarity about what will happen next.\u201d\n\nLoughlin\u2019s daughter, Olivia Jade, has yet to Instagram her feelings about the matter.\n\nStay in touch.
