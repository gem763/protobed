Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) credited Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) with inspiring her to run for Congress.\n\n\u201cThe only reason I had any hope in launching a long-shot campaign for Congress is because Bernie Sanders proved that you can run a grassroots campaign and win in an America where we almost thought it was impossible,\u201d she said, referring to the 2016 presidential run for which she volunteered.\n\nThen, with the crowd of tens of thousands roaring their approval, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress welcomed her \u201cTio Bernie\u201d \u2015 the oldest presidential candidate in a crowded field \u2015 to the stage.\n\nThe image of the pair of progressive rock stars with their clasped hands raised triumphantly as they waved to the crowd perfectly encapsulated the message that Sanders hoped to send with his first rally since having a heart attack at the start of the month: that he is not only prepared to serve as president, he is the voice of the rising generation of progressive, multiracial youth.\n\n\u201cI am happy to report to you that I am more than ready \u2015 more ready than ever to carry on the epic struggle that we face today,\u201d Sanders declared. \u201cTo put it bluntly, I am back.\u201d\n\nSanders, who normally ascends the stage to the sounds of John Lennon and Yoko Ono\u2019s \u201cPower to the People,\u201d chose a different track for his big comeback rally: AC/DC\u2019s \u201cBack in Black.\u201d\n\nThe event management firm staffing the event and providing security estimated that 25,872 people attended the rally, according to the Sanders campaign.\n\nThe New York City Parks Department said it had provided a permit for a crowd of 15,000 for the event. And while it is impossible to independently verify the figure, there were indeed throngs of attendees outside the rally perimeter and down the street because the campaign had determined the event was at its legal capacity.\n\nIf the estimate is even loosely accurate, it makes Sanders\u2019 rally the largest of any Democratic candidate this election cycle. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts likely came closest with a mid-September rally in Manhattan that Warren\u2019s campaign estimates drew 22,000 people.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) hugs Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) during a campaign rally on Saturday in New York.\n\nAs with other Sanders campaign rallies, the \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d gathering in Queens had a festive, carnivalesque atmosphere as devout, mostly young, Berniecrats from across the metropolitan area donned swag, held homemade signs and chanted progressive slogans \u2015 \u201cBernie\u2019s back,\u201d \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d and \u201cA-O-C\u201d were just three of the favorites. At least one attendee was wearing a giant, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mask of Sanders and was affectionately imitating him.\n\nBut Saturday\u2019s Queens rally felt more jubilant than his other campaign rallies, which have generally not been preceded by such formative \u2014 and at times, for his supporters, frightening \u2014 developments.\n\nSanders had already proven his mettle with an enthusiastic debate performance on Oct. 15 and the news that Reps. Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) would be backing his bid.\n\nAt 78, though, he remains under additional pressure to prove his health and vitality after the Oct. 1 heart attack.\n\nHis campaign was working at breakneck speed in the run-up to the rally, highlighting new policy proposals and announcing three additional endorsements from New York elected officials in the hours before Sanders took the stage.\n\nNabbing Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s backing was a particular coup for the campaign, given her enormous following. She said on Saturday that after nearly a year in Congress, she found Sanders\u2019 staunch independence throughout his three decades in the same institution even more impressive.\n\n\u201cBehind closed doors, your arm is twisted ... and every trick in the book \u2015 psychological and otherwise \u2015 is used to get us to abandon the working class,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cIt has been in that experience of the past nine months, that I have grown to appreciate the enormous, consistent and nonstop advocacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\n\"When you talk to Bernie, he doesn't talk about making a movement so that he can get elected. He talks about his campaign as part of a mass movement in America. And that's the kind of leadership that I think we need right now.\" -@AOC pic.twitter.com/xaF1WAaw0j \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 19, 2019\n\nIn addition to Ocasio-Cortez, the roster of speakers that preceded Sanders was a who\u2019s-who of progres stars and Sanders partisans: his wife Jane; filmmaker Michael Moore; San Juan, Puerto Rico Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz; former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner; and former Queens district attorney candidate Tiffany Cab\u00e1n. Each of the speakers made a point of pushing back against concerns about Sanders\u2019 health and finding ways to distinguish him from Warren, who has overtaken him in the polls.\n\n\u201cThe only heart attack that we should be worried about is the heart attack Wall Street is going to have when Bernie Sanders is president of the United States,\u201d Moore bellowed.\n\nTurner, a veteran of the 2016 campaign known for her pugnacious style, went on an extended riff blasting both former Vice President Joe Biden and Warren without naming either of them.\n\n\u201cThere are some people who sat on the sidelines before and there was only one person who stood up to the establishment and his name is Bernard Sanders,\u201d Turner said, referencing Warren\u2019s neutrality during the 2016 presidential primary.\n\n\u201cThere are many copies, but there is only one original,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you would take the copy, baby, when you can have the original.\u201d\n\nTogether, not only will we clean up our environment, but we will finally put an end to environmental racism. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\n\nThere was no substitute, however, for Sanders himself declaiming for nearly an hour, his voice occasionally growing raspy, about the ravages of corruption and inequality.\n\n\u201cBrothers and sisters, Congress may not talk about it, the media may not talk about it, but not only will we talk about income and wealth inequality, we are going to do something about it,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders even tailored parts of his speech to fit the location, deviating from his famously consistent messaging. The campaign deliberately chose to hold the rally in a park next to the largest public housing complex in the country \u2015 and in the shadow of New York\u2019s dirtiest power plant.\n\nSanders promised that his affordable housing plan, which would create a national rent control system preventing significant rent hikes, would allot an additional $20 billion to New York City\u2019s public housing authority alone. And he framed the Green New Deal as a solution uniquely designed to address the kind of \u201cenvironmental racism\u201d embodied by the concentration of public housing next to sources of pollution.\n\n\u201cTogether, not only will we clean up our environment, but we will finally put an end to environmental racism,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is not yet clear the size of the impact that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement will have on Sanders\u2019 campaign. Her strongest following is with left-leaning young people, who already make up Sanders\u2019 biggest bloc of support \u2015 albeit one where recent polling has shown him losing ground.\n\nBut there was no question at Saturday\u2019s rally that she had breathed new excitement into Sanders\u2019 supporters, as well as the senator himself. Sanders said he looked forward to her accompanying him on the campaign trail across the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been around politics for a few years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it is hard to believe the degree to which in less than one year, this woman \u2015 the youngest woman ever elected to Congress ... has transformed politics in America.\u201d", "description": "The Sanders campaign estimated that the rally drew nearly 26,000 attendees, which would make it the largest Democratic presidential rally of this cycle.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dab7668210000621bad34ee.jpeg?cache=u8n7hceo5s&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
