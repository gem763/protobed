Allen Brack saying the company had \"reacted too quickly\" in making its decision.\n\nBrack said that Chung still had to be penalized as he had violated rules, but that his specific views were not a factor in the decision.\n\n\"I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision,\" he said in a post on Blizzard's website.\n\nChung said in a statement posted on Twitter that he accepted Blizzard's decision and would express his opinions on his personal platforms in the future, but urged the company to reconsider its decision to penalize two commentators at the tournament where he had made his remarks.\n\nThe Hong Kong protests began in opposition to a bill allowing extradition to mainland China but have since evolved into broader calls for democracy, with activists throwing petrol bombs, setting street fires and trashing metro stations.\n\nChina has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong and reacted strongly to expressions of support for the protests.\n\nLast week, the NBA became the target of a fierce backlash in China after one of its team managers posted a now-deleted tweet that expressed support for the Hong Kong protesters, which Chinese state media characterized as the latest example of meddling in China\u2019s own affairs.\n\n(Reporting by Brenda Goh; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)", "description": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Blizzard Entertainment has reduced the punishment that it dealt out to a Hong Kong-based Hearthstone esports player for his public support of pro-democracy protests in the city, after its decision sparked controversy among players and the public.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
