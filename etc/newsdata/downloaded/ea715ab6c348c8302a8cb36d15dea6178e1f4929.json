What will it mean in Oita on Sunday? Nothing, apparently.\n\nBack in 2006, psychologists identified a condition specifically affecting Japanese tourists on holiday in Paris. Most tended to be young women, of independent means, and single.\n\nThe illness would begin with unexplained feelings of disorientation, panic and nausea before settling into deep depression.\n\nThe unpredictable nature of the France sides means they could be a huge challenge for Wales\n\nThe only cure was to return to Japan immediately, often in the company of a nurse supplied by the local embassy.\n\nParis Syndrome was believed to be caused by a romanticised view of what Paris is, and would be, followed by the shocking let-down when confronted with the reality.\n\nJapan loves its idealised France. Tokyo is home to hundreds of splendid French restaurants, patisseries and cafes; art galleries are stuffed to the ceilings with impressionists. And Paris is seen as France's epitome; a place of romance and charm. All cobbled streets, elegance and good lighting, like the film Amelie.\n\nThe actuality is that Paris is busy and dirty and brusque, and its inhabitants about as receptive to a moonstruck Japanese tourist as they would be to a request for a well-done steak. Cue tears.\n\nFrench rugby is much the same. You think it is one thing, something else turns up. And not from era to era, either \u2014 from tournament to tournament, from game to game \u2014 or half to half if one considers the performance against Argentina.\n\nWarren Gatland may know France's XV but Wales still have no idea what team they will face\n\nFrench rugby makes no sense. We are used to clubs, to teams, moving through phases. Manchester United were a very good team under Sir Alex Ferguson, and now they are not.\n\nYet French rugby can be Ferguson's United one day, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's the next. This is why at World Cups they are the ultimate wild card.\n\nFrance have won a lone Six Nations since 2004 and haven't done the Grand Slam this century, yet they have never failed to get out of the pool stage at a Rugby World Cup and have reached the semi-final or final in six of eight editions.\n\nWhy? Perhaps because this is the one period in the calendar when French international rugby escapes the grip of its league, when the coaches and players get time together beyond the interference of powerful clubs.\n\nMourad Boudjellal, outspoken owner of Toulon, may have been telling the players to rise up against their coaches, but they are outside his clutches here.\n\nSo, while the usual rumours of dissent in the camp circle \u2014 captain Guilhem Guirado is believed to have fallen out with coach Jacques Brunel \u2014 France sail on.\n\nWarren Gatland might know France's XV on Friday morning but Wales still have no idea what team they will be facing come Sunday. And that makes France dangerous. Much like Paris, if you go in thinking it's all moonlight and magic.\n\nGoodbye, not-so-super tiebreak\n\nNobody will ever win the Cricket World Cup quite like England in 2019, and that is a fact.\n\nNobody can now because the way England won it is to be abolished. The International Cricket Council's new tiebreak rules at the end of the deciding Super Over will be for a second Super Over.\n\nNot, as happened this summer, a random countback through boundaries scored in the game. It always seemed like the last idea of an overrunning meeting anyway.\n\nNobody will ever win the Cricket World Cup quite like England in 2019\n\nThe item on the schedule that is raised just as everybody is packing up, checking their watches, dashing for the last train or wondering if the restaurant will hold their reservation.\n\n'And suppose the Super Over is a draw?' chimes one keen soul. 'Er, what? Well, then, er, we'll just give it to, er...whoever hit the most fours. Yes, that's it. Write that down. It's never going to happen anyway, is it? Hello? Yes, darling, I know, I'm on my way...' So, all things considered, it could have been worse. Rock, paper, scissors, perhaps?\n\nGiggs wrong over head case\n\nHow typical that football's new protocols around head injuries should swiftly be exploited for tactical gain.\n\nWales manager Ryan Giggs admitted Daniel James was being 'streetwise', 'acting' and 'using his nous' when he stayed down, apparently struck on the head, during a 1-1 draw with Croatia.\n\nThe danger, obviously, is that if match officials start to believe players are feigning head trauma, they will be increasingly sceptical about stopping play and a serious injury could be missed.\n\nTalking about it doesn't seem the brightest idea, either. Maybe Giggs has headed one too many footballs, too.\n\nWales manager Ryan Giggs said Daniel James was being 'streetwise', 'acting' after the collision\n\nSo close, yet so VAR\n\nThe Premier League returns this weekend and with it, no doubt, further debate about the merits of VAR.\n\nThe official line is that its boundaries are established and will not be altered by external pressure. And yet, after weeks of action in which VAR was criticised for erasing goals by fractions of centimetres, suddenly it began putting them on. In the two weekends before the international break, Arsenal, Bournemouth and Crystal Palace were all given goals initially disallowed for offside. What a happy coincidence.\n\nAlmost as if someone at Professional Game Match Officials had a word about how negative VAR was coming across.\n\nNot that this would ever happen, of course.\n\nChevrolet were always going to miss out\n\nWhat were Chevrolet ever going to get from a sponsorship with Manchester United? Try to buy one of their vehicles over here. 'Find your dealer' on the Chevrolet website yielded five outlets between London and Edinburgh. Good luck getting that serviced and back the same day.\n\nOf course, United are a global brand. Chevrolet's tie-up was not simply about selling cars in Britain. Even so, their \u00a3410million agreement beginning in 2014 always felt extravagant and the executive who signed it off, global marketing chief Joel Ewanick, left the company 48 hours after the deal was announced.\n\nChevrolet's eye-wateringly expensive deal with Manchester United hasn't worked as planned\n\nBetween the signature and the start, Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down and United have struggled ever since. That would not matter so much if the club's PR was not peopled by snarling, miserable managers, with Chevrolet merely the backdrop to another short and sour interrogation.\n\nIt wouldn't want to make you buy one of their cars, least of all head to Scotland to do so.\n\nFans care about results, not owners\n\nUnsurprisingly, Prince Abdullah's endorsement of the Bin Laden family did not turn out to be a crowd-pleaser for Sheffield United.\n\nA court heard that after the new owner spoke of his friendship and business dealings with the Bin Ladens, he faced challenging questions from, among others, Santander Bank. There is, of course, a difference between one of Saudi Arabia's most respected business groups, and its most notorious family member.\n\nPrince Abdullah's endorsement of the Bin Laden family did not turn out to be a crowd-pleaser\n\nAs Harry Redknapp once pointed out, too, fans wouldn't care if Saddam Hussein was in charge of their club as long as it was successful.\n\nIf Chris Wilder keeps the Blades in the Premier League and Prince Abdullah makes good his promises of investment, expect chants of 'There's only one Osama' echoing around Bramall Lane before the end of the season.\n\nNo excuses, Scotland!\n\nScotland departed Japan with a final gripe at the organisers of the Rugby World Cup. Coach Gregor Townsend complained that Japan, as hosts, had at least seven days turnaround between each game, while Scotland played their final match having faced Russia four days earlier.\n\nYet a favourable spread of fixtures as a gesture to the host nation has been a part of the competition since 2011 and it wasn't any great help to England in 2015, eliminated at the pool stage.\n\nScotland departed Japan with a final gripe at the organisers of the Rugby World Cup\n\nEqually, there were few complaints from Scotland that year when Japan came into their meeting on the back of the heroic win over South Africa in Brighton four days earlier, exhausted.\n\nScotland, playing their first game, won easily, 45-10. They played Ireland fresh this year, too, and turned in a dismal performance, amassing three points. Scotland did not go home because of the schedule; they went because they were not good enough.\n\nNever forget, revenue is the real equaliser\n\nGiven the names around them, it is unlikely Lewes will win promotion to the Women's Super League this season. After six Championship fixtures, they are already seven points behind Aston Villa, who have a game in hand.\n\nYet as the club that proudly boasts of equal pay for its men's and women's teams \u2014 and, rather ludicrously, moralises that others should follow their lead \u2014 if they do ever go up, it will be interesting to see where that policy goes.\n\nFor the WSL requires professionalism and at least the minimum wage to be paid. So the men's team, occupying 18th place in the Isthmian Premier League table \u2014 not quite as good as Merstham, but above Brightlingsea Regent \u2014 would receive parity. And, potentially, considering the differing circumstances and revenue streams, that could be ruinous.\n\nNot quite to the extent of giving Aston Villa's women's team parity with Jack Grealish, but financially testing nonetheless. Maybe the Lewes men's team wouldn't simply be disbanded as most women's teams would if equal pay became the norm, but the circumstances would be problematic. As it stands, men and women at Lewes receive between \u00a3100 and \u00a3250 per match, because the budgets and revenues are similar.\n\nAston Villa could not strike a similar deal and give their men's and women's teams parity\n\nYet even if Lewes do not reach the WSL in the short term, the increasing popularity of the women's team will one day make them bigger than a seventh-tier men's team; in which case, they should be rewarded accordingly.\n\nIt will be interesting, then, if Lewes ever do make the step to the WSL, to see whether the club accepts that economic reality, not sexism, dictates the pay gap in elite football.\n\nThe reality is Lewes have a unique business model that allows its clubs to exist on equal terms. That is basic economics, not gender politics, as even the most strident moraliser may one day have to appreciate.\n\nBury must start from scratch\n\nAnother suitor has pulled out of negotiations for Bury. Yet this doesn't have to be the end. The club can still be resurrected by its supporters further down football's pyramid.\n\nWhat has to be abandoned is the idea that Bury should be reborn within touching distance of football's professional leagues.\n\nIf the club needs to start lower and find its bearings, that is surely preferable to aiming higher and ceasing to exist at all.\n\nThe idea Bury should be reborn in touching distance of football's professional leagues is wrong\n\nWelcome to a fantasy world where Spurs win trophies\n\nWatching Match Of The Day on Saturday you will see, as always, the expected goals tally for each match. It appears as xG in the bottom right corner of the screen.\n\nClub analysts have been working with xG for close to a decade now, but it has only recently entered the public consciousness.\n\nWhat is xG? It is a way of counting chances based on historical analysis, when other teams and players have had efforts from similar locations in similar match scenarios.\n\nRoughly 79 per cent of penalties are scored, so a penalty has a rating of 0.79 xG, whether it goes in or not. For that's the point. What happened does not matter; it's what should have happened that counts.\n\nExpected goals (xG) is often criticised, and the statistics in favour of Tottenham show why\n\nSo Vincent Kompany shouldn't have scored from outside the area for Manchester City against Leicester last season, meaning his goal has an xG rating of 0.025. Equally, Sergio Aguero's missed penalty against Tottenham in the Champions League should have been scored, so achieves the high rating for penalty conversion of 0.79.\n\nYou can see why those of us who might be termed old school tend to regard xG cynically. We may, however, have reached peak xG following the last round of Champions League matches. Because it's good news for Tottenham. It turned out they beat Bayern Munich after all.\n\nThe result in the real world may have been 7-2 to Munich, and one of the most embarrassing scorelines in Spurs history, but in the fantasy world of xG it was Tottenham 1.45 Bayern 1.34.\n\nWhat a triumph for Mauricio Pochettino and the boys. With this turnaround in fortunes they should book an expected bus, for the expected parade, showing off all the expected trophies they will win. Indeed, with success built on such firm and logical foundations, what could possibly go wrong?\n\nMore Fury tediousness\n\nFresh news from the world of tedium and Tyson Fury appears to have found another reason not to have his rematch with Deontay Wilder.
