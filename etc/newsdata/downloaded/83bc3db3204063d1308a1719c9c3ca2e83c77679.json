And if you booked on British Airways, you then suddenly realized that 4,000 pilots were staging a 48-hour walkout, effectively stranding 195,000 passengers. More strikes are planned for September 27th.\n\nAnd you have no backup plan.\n\nWe\u2019re not here to take sides in this specific airline fight. We\u2019re here to get you where you\u2019re going and/or get reimbursed for your flight the next time this happens. Follow these steps.\n\nBuy travel insurance\n\n\u201cTravel insurance can certainly help in the event of an airline strike,\u201d says Julie Loffredi from InsureMyTrip, a travel insurance comparison site. \u201cBut as with all travel insurance coverage, it\u2019s important to understand the role of the insurance policy in mitigating any strike-related issues, and when these benefits may or may not apply.\u201d\n\nAnd if you\u2019re worried about a strike, don\u2019t look to the airline for help. \u201cIn most cases, airlines are not obligated to reimburse you for a flight that is cancelled or severely delayed due to a labor strike,\u201d says Stan Sandberg, co-founder of TravelInsurance.com (another travel insurance comparison site). \u201cIf an airline cannot or will not honor your pre-purchased ticket in the event of a strike, generally travel insurance will cover you as long as you booked your flight and purchased the insurance before the unexpected strike dates were announced.\u201d\n\nBuy travel insurance when you book your ticket\n\nMost travel insurance can be purchased up to the day prior to your departure date. \u201cWe recommend travelers purchase their travel insurance policy within a set number of days (usually 7-21 days) of their initial trip payment date, such as when they are booking their flight,\u201d says Sandberg.\n\nGet this plan\n\nLoffredi suggests purchasing a comprehensive travel insurance policy, because that includes coverage for unannounced strikes \u2014 as well, you\u2019ll be covered for travel delays, cancellations or other interruptions that come up thereafter. It\u2019s more expensive (think 4-10% of your total, pre-paid, non-refundable trip cost), but again, you\u2019re more likely to get reimbursed if there\u2019s an issue.\n\nNow, let\u2019s define your delay. To get any compensation usually requires a minimum of six hours of travel interruption; depending on your plan, you\u2019ll be eligible for reimbursement for food, lodging and additional transportation costs that are a direct result of your delay. Trip interruption (which is part of a comprehensive plan) can provide assistance for travelers who are delayed for a longer period of time, like 12-24 hours. At 24 hours or more, you may qualify to cancel your trip and be reimbursed for your pre-paid, insured trip costs.\n\nFile your claim, and \u2026 wait\n\nIf a strike requires you to re-book tickets on another carrier, you might be able to file a claim with your insurance provider to reimburse some (or all) of the cost of that additional ticket \u2014 depending on your policy. \u201cIf the airline or other carrier didn\u2019t reimburse you fully for the tickets you lost due to their strike, travel insurance policies may operate on a \u2018make-whole\u2019 philosophy,\u201d says Loffredi. \u201cDepending on your plan and policy limits, this means insurance policies may offer reimbursement for the difference between what you\u2019ve paid and what the airline refunded back to you.\u201d\n\nReimbursement takes about two weeks after filing a claim, Sandberg notes.\n\nMost importantly, read up on your airline before you buy a ticket (or travel insurance)\n\nYou have to purchase all this insurance while the strike is still considered an \u201cunforeseen event\u201d (and most of these strikes are announced in advance). So that September 27th second strike by British Airways is not going to be applicable. Your best bet is to do a little research and make sure you\u2019re comfortable with the airline you\u2019re booking with, then buy trip insurance as soon as you can after your ticket purchase.", "description": "The one thing passengers should have in case of a walkout", "authors": ["Kirk Miller"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BritishAirways.jpg?fit=1200%2C800", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
