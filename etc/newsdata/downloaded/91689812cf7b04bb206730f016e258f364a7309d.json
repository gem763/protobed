It\u2019s been an exciting privilege, and sometimes an abysmal chore, to have played all of the NBA 2K basketball games. A highlight, if you care dearly about narrative, came in 2016, when Spike Lee took on a career story called \u201cLivin\u2019 Da Dream,\u201d which he directed and helped to write. It wasn\u2019t perfect, because it needed varied interactivity, but it was written tautly. If you didn\u2019t shed a tear at the story\u2019s end, you didn\u2019t know anything about the travails of basketball \u2014 of life, even.\n\nThere\u2019s a new narrative in NBA 2K20 called \u201cWhen the Lights Are Brightest.\u201d It\u2019s produced by LeBron James\u2019s social-justice-oriented Springhill Entertainment, which created documentaries such as the inspiring, unpredictable \u201cWarriors of Liberty City\u201d and the upcoming \u201cStudent Athlete,\u201d an investigation surrounding college players who receive no payments in a billion-dollar industry. Add in the involvement of stars such as Golden Globe winner Idris Elba and Rosario Dawson, and the latest version of NBA 2K\u2019s story mode projected a hope it could match the greatness of \u201cLivin\u2019 'Da Dream\u201d in terms of drama and sharp dialogue.\n\nUnfortunately, \u201cWhen the Lights Are Brightest\u201d marks a step backward for the idea of strong, potent stories in sports games. The narrative in NBA 2K20 is below average at best. It\u2019s hollow, even empty, at its worst.\n\nThe story of ardent Che making his way from college to the pros tries to hit the buttons of heart and soul in the way Lee did. Che, played by Deric Augustine, boldly and naively sticks up for himself and his injured teammate and friend who loses his scholarship, to the detriment of his career. But ultimately this tale is more about the process of rising through the ranks, dressing well, getting sponsorships and building a personal (ugh) brand.\n\n[Elimination of loot boxes could crush Rocket League's black market]\n\nThe gravitas of Elba, who can convey the emotional depth of his coach character simply by looking askance, is almost wasted here. The empathy of Dawson as a college adviser and mentor is never allowed to blossom. Though she wants one, she\u2019s not given any role in a man\u2019s world of basketball. After being given the boot by Che, she comes back to congratulate the draftee on rising through the ranks. Did she suck up her feelings of rejection? Does she want a job with Che? Is she a long-suffering friend? Or does the maturity of real friendship never require Che to say the words \u201cI missed you\u201d? We don\u2019t know the motivation behind her return, and it weakens her character.\n\nAnd motivation is key here. So is backstory. Instead, we\u2019re left with a story without nuance that fails to manifest much drama or emotion. When a shocked Che sadly and angrily says his mother has been threatened with death by haters on social media, you expect him to comfort his mother. I mean, she\u2019s his mother. Instead, you never hear about his mother again. She\u2019s not even at the NBA draft at Brooklyn\u2019s Barclays Center. Did she die from doxing? Does Che not care about her anymore? We\u2019re never told, because the story is focused only on moving onward and upward in the wide world of basketball and not on exploring the life and world of its protagonist.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong, of course, with setting a course for your financial future as a pro \u2014 even with an internal craving for fame. The trappings are here. We see Che on a lot of planes, taking off and landing. We see him in a lot of meetings with James\u2019s company. We hear him going rah, rah, rah for a possible Gatorade sponsorship. But Che, who calls himself a quiet guy, an introvert, never deals with the trappings of financial success. He just accepts them and occasionally has the chance to eschew them. We don\u2019t know what he\u2019s really thinking deep down inside.\n\nUltimately, the NBA 2K20 story is present to give players a tutorial. And it\u2019s good to feel more comfortable with new gameplay, no matter how experienced you are, before you face the ups and downs of a full season. But the magic of video games should be that any portion of the game shouldn\u2019t feel shoehorned into the whole. You know immediately that the mild redemption story is here as window dressing for learning to play. And when you know that, you somehow feel cheated. There\u2019s little soul here, so playing through the story drags. It feels twice as long as it is.\n\n[Control: A space-warping science fiction game with much to like but not much to love]\n\nWhen James, truly the greatest player of his generation, appears in a close-up to tell you to remember the tired and poor as you make your way in the league, it\u2019s an important, honest moment. James has given back throughout his career, including most recently with a new basketball court at a high school he lovingly supports in Akron, Ohio. But wouldn\u2019t these words of inspiration have been so much more powerful if they were shown in all their real-life worthiness, not told as gospel? Just as James dug deep into his soul against the Golden State Warriors in the 2016 NBA Finals, this story could have been one to be remembered had it gone deeper into the struggle, showing how those with the odds stacked against them can win, how they can come back.\n\nThere are flashes of this. You play ball on a court at the Bronx\u2019s Sack-Wern Houses. Scottie Pippen talks poignantly about overcoming his Arkansas childhood in a family of 12 supported by a factory-worker father. But they come and go too quickly, an intriguing but fleeting fragrance whisked away by the wind. These moments are strong and moving, but they don\u2019t seem to be woven by a brilliant writer\u2019s hand. Worse, they are not worked into the protagonist\u2019s essence.\n\nI mention all this because, despite annoyingly prevalent advertising, the rest of NBA 2K20 is a gem to behold. The motion capture of most players\u2019 faces adds essential clarity. You do feel as if you are among these superstars when you play. They sweat. They gripe. They move in their powerful ballets to win or lose and thrive in a sport that\u2019s distracted by stupid hot takes on social media. The men and women, cheerleaders and T-shirt-cannon folk, who do halftime shows are shown with respect in close-ups. It feels energizing and empowering.\n\nThe controls are responsive to even a feathery touch. The wide variety of things to do and see \u2014 from playing all teams in the WNBA to easy, off-the-ball offense to eye-catching menus for leveling up your character \u2014 is breathtaking. The thoughtful soundtrack mixes \u2014 including Travis Scott\u2019s dazzlingly produced rap and the poppier, passionate Ariana Grande \u2014 display a sense of musical DJ genius. It all just makes the very average nature of the story stick out like a sore thumb. As they say in all sports, whether bitterly or optimistically, there\u2019s always next year.\n\nHarold Goldberg has written for the New York Times, Playboy, Vanity Fair and elsewhere.
