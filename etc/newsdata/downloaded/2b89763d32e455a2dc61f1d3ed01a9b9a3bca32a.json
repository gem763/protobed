It\u2019s a Facebook show called \u201cNew Mom, Who Dis?\u201d hosted by a social-media star. Among the hard-hitting questions he got before this one were, \u201cDo you have a dad bod?\u201d\n\nAt one point a baby was placed in his arms whereupon the host exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my eggs just dropped.\u201d It\u2019s that sort of \u201cpolitics\u201d show.\n\nAnd then things took a turn\u2026\n\nThis is the funniest and most brutal takedown of a world leader I have ever seen. It is amazing. Every second of this is perfect. WOW.pic.twitter.com/TcMBp0FEbq \u2014 Harry Khachatrian (@Harry1T6) October 9, 2019\n\nYes, honey. Even the nose and hands. Everything.\n\nHe handled the question well under the circumstances, I have to say. Did he know it was coming? He might have calculated that it would earn him some goodwill with the public to be publicly contrite about his, ah, problem to two adorable little girls.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s not like this was the most embarrassing blackface-related incident involving a liberal Canadian politician this week:\n\nNearly two weeks ago, Judy Sgro, who is vying for re-election in the riding of Humber River-Black Creek, gave a one-on-one interview with a news organization called GBKM FM. During the interview, she was asked about Trudeau wearing blackface makeup. \u201cThose in the black community have told me how much more love they have for the prime minister, that he wanted to have a black face. That he took great pride in that, too,\u201d Sgro said. \u201cAnd that it\u2019s the media that have blown this into something that it shouldn\u2019t be and that they\u2019re very supportive.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s now apologized. I really thought Trudeau might be the first western politician to take a shot at arguing that his youthful experiments with blackface were actually a sign of wokeness, that he was eager to try on brown skin because he identifies so much with those who have it naturally. But no, even a man with impeccable liberal credentials doesn\u2019t dare try to convince the media on that one. A precious few sins are so grave that even having the right politics is no defense. Amazing that this guy is guilty of one of them.", "description": "\"Ooh.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jt.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
