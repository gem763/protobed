The company today announced a new \u2018trade up\u2018 program that offers existing Sonos users a 30 percent discount to buy a new speaker if they recycle an eligible older model.\n\nIt works like this: Sign in to your Sonos account and go to the Trade Up tab. Once you confirm the device you\u2019re recycling, you\u2019ll receive your discount. Your old device will then go into a \u2018Recycle Mode\u2019 after 21 days. This will clear the device of all data and permanently deactivate it.\n\nWhile you can ship the devices back to Sonos with a pre-paid shipping label, the company suggests you instead take the device to a certified local recycler or a participating retailer. The latter two options are better for the environment.\n\nThe models currently eligible for trade in are the Connect, Connect:Amp, ZP80, ZP90, ZP100, ZP120 and the first generation Play:5. As a nice touch, you don\u2019t simply get a discount for the newest version of a particular product; you can trade in an old Connect and still get a 30 percent discount on the new Play:5, for instance.\n\nMoreover, you get a 30 percent discount for every product you replace, and you can use your discount at Sonos\u2018 website, at a participating retailer, or through an authorized Sonos installer.\n\nIt\u2019s a gesture of good will from a company that tends to support its old tech longer than most. You can of course always \u2018recycle\u2019 your product by simply selling it, but the trade-up program is a welcome incentive to dissuade people from throwing out their old units.
