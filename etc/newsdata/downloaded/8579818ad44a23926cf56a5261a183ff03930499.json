Ahmed\u2019s leadership on restoring peace with Eritrea is an important reminder to us all that progress is indeed possible, even under the most trying of circumstances,\u201d John Shumlansky, the Ethiopian country representative for the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) told Crux.\n\nCRS is the official international development arm of the U.S. bishops conference.\n\nThe 43-year-old Abiy was awarded the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for sweeping political reforms and for making peace with long-time rival Eritrea.\n\nEritrea \u2013 a former Italian colony \u2013 was later joined with Ethiopia in 1955. The province fought a decades long insurgency before officially gaining independence in 1993.\n\nHowever, border disputes continued, and the two nations fought a 1998-2000 war that left over 100,000 people dead. A peace agreement wasn\u2019t signed until 2018, when Abiy made several unilateral concessions to push it through, even though Ethiopia held the stronger military position.\n\nAbiy also introduced sweeping political reforms in the authoritarian country, allowing greater civil liberties, freeing political prisoners, and allowing dissidents living in exile to return home.\n\nHowever, the new open political climate has led to new challenges, as long-simmering ethnic tensions to bubble to the surface, creating conflicts.\n\nThe fighting has caused over 2 million people to be displaced in the country of just over 100 million people.\n\nShumlansky said he hopes the Peace Prize will also help bring peace to the country\u2019s battling ethnic groups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our hope that this award can shine a spotlight on all of the tireless peace building efforts happening within Ethiopia to bring about an end to internal conflict,\u201d he told Crux.\n\nHe said CRS and Ethiopian Catholic Church \u201care working closely with the Government of Ethiopia on peacebuilding efforts in the country\u2019s Oromia and SNNPR regions, where some 2.9 million people were uprooted from their homes due to ethnic conflict since 2018.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ultimate aim of our work is to foster lasting peace and address the root causes of the conflict. Our experience working in Ethiopia has taught us that working for peace at the local level is imperative to creating lasting change. Before we can begin encouraging people to talk about peace, we know that we must first address their humanitarian needs including the need for clean water, shelter and food security,\u201d Shumlansky said.\n\nHe said the CRS, along with local partners, has \u201cprovided critical services like food, shelter, water, sanitation, hygiene, economic support and other assistance to displaced families and returning families.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough the generous support of USAID Food for Peace and the UK Department for International Development (DFID) we\u2019ve helped to build over 1,500 homes, helped provide nearly 75,000 people with access to water, and provided food to an average of more than 400,000 displaced people per distribution. These distributions take place about every 45 days,\u201d said Shumlansky.\n\n\u201cAs part of our peace building efforts, we bring together people from both sides of the conflict and encourage them to work together on \u2018connector\u2019 projects that benefit their communities as a whole. As a result, people who were embroiled in conflict not long ago end up working side by side to refurbish their schools and health clinics or build and manage new water distribution points and wells. In the process, they also find common ground and the time to talk openly about the path to sustainable peace,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough Abiy has been celebrated for his peacebuilding efforts, he has recently warned that Ethiopia is ready to go to war with Egypt has tensions rise over an Ethiopian dam on the Nile river.\n\nEgypt has expressed concerns the project will stem the flow of the country\u2019s main source of freshwater, with some officials saying it\u2019s a national security issue that might require a military response.\n\n\u201cSome say things about use of force. It should be underlined that no force could stop Ethiopia from building a dam,\u201d Abiy said on Tuesday. \u201cIf there is a need to go to war, we could get millions readied. If some could fire a missile, others could use bombs. But that\u2019s not in the best interest of all of us.\u201d\n\nCrux is dedicated to smart, wired and independent reporting on the Vatican and worldwide Catholic Church.
