It scored high for keeping its ice creams smooth and rich while experimenting with some unexpected flavours.\n\nWe decided to see what the fuss is about, and we were not disappointed.\n\nUnframed stores can be found in the V&A Food Market, Gardens, and in Woodstock in Cape Town.\n\nThe ice creams are beautifully lit in these fridges.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/div&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\nI was sceptical about the vegan-friendly ice creams: beetroot chocolate and ginger; matcha latte, and turmeric.\n\nI\u2019ve had vegan friendly ice cream before and it has been a hard miss for me.\n\nBut I found Unframed's vegan flavours were some of the smoothest and tastiest I\u2019ve ever had. They tasted just like dairy-based ice cream - it was like fairies were dancing on my taste buds.\n\nThey allowed me to try a healthy sample of each flavour, which not all ice cream parlours do.\n\nIn the end I opted for a scoop of turmeric.\n\nThis is a genuine face of contentment.\n\nThe ice creams start at R39 for 1 scoop.\n\nUnframed beat some truly outrageous ice cream makers...\n\nLike the Milkcow Cafe in Vancouver, Canada which makes a watermelon ice cream sandwich.\n\n...and Giapo, which makes this colossal chocolate squid ice cream, based in Auckland, New Zealand.\n\nFor the full list you can go to the Big 7 website here.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "At the Unframed ice cream parlour prices start at R39 per scoop, and the turmeric flavour is worth trying.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9464/9eca39b095d34da387230f820290858a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
