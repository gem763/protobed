And at any given moment, Google\u2019s staff is working on features and software enhancements that most people won\u2019t see for a matter of weeks \u2014 or months.\n\nHere\u2019s a little secret, though: if you\u2019re feeling adventurous, you can gain access to those unreleased enhancements. All it takes is the flip of a virtual switch in your Chromebook\u2019s settings, and you\u2019ll have all sorts of interesting new options at your fingertips.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s important to understand exactly what\u2019s involved so you can make an educated decision about which setup makes the most sense for you.\n\nUnderstanding the Chrome OS channels\n\nChrome OS actually exists in four separate development channels. The software you see on your Chromebook varies considerably depending on which channel you choose:\n\nThe Stable channel is the polished and ready-for-prime-time version of the software that all devices use by default.\n\nis the polished and ready-for-prime-time version of the software that all devices use by default. The Beta channel is updated weekly and receives new features about a month ahead of its Stable sibling.\n\nis updated weekly and receives new features about a month ahead of its Stable sibling. The Developer channel is updated as frequently as twice a week and sees stuff that\u2019s actively being worked on and has undergone only a small amount of testing.\n\nis updated as frequently as twice a week and sees stuff that\u2019s actively being worked on and has undergone only a small amount of testing. Finally, the Canary channel is what Google describes as the \u201cbleeding edge\u201d Chrome OS path \u2014 a channel that receives daily updates, prior to any widespread testing, and can be accessed only by a Chromebook that\u2019s switched into a special developer mode (which, somewhat confusingly, has nothing to do with the Developer channel).\n\nThe Stable channel is the safest option and what the vast majority of people should use \u2014 particularly those who need to know their computers will always work flawlessly, without any hiccups or unexpected glitches.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling adventurous and don\u2019t mind a bit of a risk, the Beta channel is a good way to get a peek at unreleased features without too much instability. The odds of running into something funky are certainly higher than with Stable, but by and large, elements in Beta are fairly well developed and just in the final phases of testing.\n\nMost day-to-day users would be well advised to stay away from the Developer channel, since it receives updates as they\u2019re built and is quite likely to contain bugs. And as for the Canary channel, if you\u2019re not sure whether you ought to be using it, the answer is probably no.\n\nChanging your Chrome OS channel\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided which channel you want to try, here\u2019s how to make the switch:\n\nOpen your Chromebook\u2019s settings.\n\nClick \u201cAbout Chrome OS\u201d in the menu on the left, then click \u201cDetailed build information.\u201d\n\nLook for the category \u201cChannel\u201d and click the \u201cChange channel\u201d button. That\u2019ll cause a pop-up to appear that lets you select the Stable, Beta, or Developer channel. (Canary, remember, is available only if your device is in Developer mode \u2014 a level of access that opens the door to more advanced forms of OS modification, but also disables some of the software\u2019s standard layers of protection. It requires several extra steps to enable and, again, isn\u2019t advisable for most Chromebook users.)\n\nClick the channel you want, then click the blue confirmation button that appears.\n\nClick the left-facing arrow at the top of the screen to get back to the \u201cAbout Chrome OS\u201d page. When you see the \u201cRestart\u201d button appear (it may take a minute or two), click it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it: As soon as your Chromebook finishes restarting, you\u2019ll be on your new channel, with all your accounts, files, and preferences in place just like you left them.\n\nIf you ever decide you want to move back to the Stable channel, repeat that same process and select \u201cStable.\u201d Just note that moving in that direction \u2014 from a higher channel to a less experimental one \u2014 generally requires you to Powerwash your Chromebook, which means all of your information and data will be erased, and you\u2019ll have to sign in anew and start over.\n\nThe one exception: if your Chromebook is connected to a work- or school-based G Suite account, your data won\u2019t be deleted and the change won\u2019t take place immediately. Instead, you\u2019ll have to wait until the lower channel catches up to the higher one in version number, which could take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months.", "description": "If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, you can gain access to unreleased Chrome OS enhancements.
