She said: \u201cI don\u2019t know where that came from.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\u201cI was filming something for my Instagram account and we noticed blood was coming off my arm.\u201d\n\nLast night\u2019s routine saw her in a tightly choreographed duel with partner Kevin Clifton, 36 \u2013 in a sporty outfit that echoed her Challenge Anneka and Treasure Hunt days.\n\nBut the gruelling training sessions with a stick left them both in agony.\n\nAnneka, who turned 61 on Friday, said: \u201cThere have been mishaps \u2013 there is a point in the dance where I had to swizzle a stick up into the air and it\u2019s meant to land neatly.\n\n\u201cBut in training it\u2019s landed in Kev\u2019s eye and it\u2019s landed in my ear. So there was quite a lot of jeopardy.\n\n\u201cWe wasted about half a day on me trying to throw a stick in the air and getting it to land in the correct place.\u201d\n\nAnneka has struggled to score well from the judges in the first two weeks.\n\nShe is one of the bookies\u2019 favourites to get voted off tonight \u2013 and admits she has no chance of winning.\n\nShe said: \u201cTo be honest, I feel it\u2019s a miracle we\u2019ve got through to this week.\n\n\u201cBut I have 100 per cent more confidence with dancing than I did when I started this a few weeks ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird taking up something so new. To start with, Kevin was struggling to get me to clap in time.\u201d\n\nEven if Anneka does bow out tonight, she admits taking part in Strictly has already changed her life.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nFor last week\u2019s show she wore a dress \u2013 a world away from the jumpsuits she is famous for.\n\nThe star had previously dismissed talk of even having a spray tan, insisting: \u201cI\u2019m not intending one bit of my body to be on display, so I can\u2019t see the point.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nBut she said: \u201cIt changed everything, that dress. I feel more feminine. It\u2019s been a huge change for me.\n\n\u201cAfter last week I\u2019m now obsessed with wearing dresses. It\u2019s opened a whole new door in my life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s given me a real incentive to stay in another week just so I can get another dress on.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The Challenge Anneka legend has been left 'black and bruised' while training for this week's Charleston.", "authors": ["Ed Gleave", "Image", "Bbc", "Mirrorpix"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20469075.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Kevin-Clifton-Anneka-Rice.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
