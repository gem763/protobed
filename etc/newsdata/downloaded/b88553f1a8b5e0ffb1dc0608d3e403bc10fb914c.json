I don't know how we are going to do it, but we have to do it.'\"\n\nThe Clippers landed George in a trade with the Oklahoma City Thunder and signed Leonard.\n\nJust this week, the NBA issued a $50,000 fine to the Milwaukee Bucks after general manager Jon Horst said publicly the team intends to offer Giannis Antetokounmpo a supermax extension next summer.\n\nTaking additional precautions to try to ensure teams and players operate within the rules is a smart course of action for the NBA given the frequency of movement throughout the league.", "description": "The  NBA  has reportedly made some adjustments to its rules in an attempt to prevent tampering.
