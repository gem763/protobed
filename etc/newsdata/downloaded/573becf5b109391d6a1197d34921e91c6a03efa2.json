In large part, that\u2019s because the Polish economy is still surprisingly strong.\n\nThis strong performance has allowed PiS to claim it\u2019s keeping the country on the right track, even as its disregard for the rule of law has scared off potential investors and measures designed to boost popular support among its voters threatens to undermine the economy.\n\nIn reality, Poland\u2019s boom is the result of positive external shocks. And if the ruling party \u2014 which is all but certain to win the country's parliamentary election on October 13 \u2014 doesn\u2019t push through serious reforms, the next downturn could seriously damage the country\u2019s future.\n\nBoom times\n\nIt might be hard to picture now. Between 2016 and 2018, GDP growth accelerated to 4.3 percent, employment jumped by 2.5 percent and unemployment fell to a record low of 3.9 percent. Inflation rose, but it remains below 2.5 percent.\n\nIf Poland's ruling party doesn't push through serious reforms, the next downturn could seriously damage the country's future.\n\nPoles have seen an increase in revenues, boosted employment and wages, and increased revenue in the country\u2019s pay-as-you-go pension system. Meanwhile, the country\u2019s fiscal deficit declined to 0.4 percent in 2018 from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2015, and public debt dropped to 48.9 percent from 51.3 percent.\n\nThe large influx of Ukrainian workers \u2014 following Russia\u2019s aggression campaign against Ukraine in 2014 \u2014 also added at least 0.5 percentage points to annual GDP growth between 2015 and 2018.\n\nBut Poland\u2019s good fortunes are in large part the result of external factors. Poland\u2019s fast GDP growth, for example, was due to the cyclical upswing in other EU countries, which peaked in 2017.\n\nAs the Continent experiences a serious slowdown, Poland won\u2019t be immune to its effects. And barring another significant influx of workers from Ukraine, which is unlikely, the most optimistic projections for Poland\u2019s employment figures is stagnation.\n\nLaw and Justice is adding to this uncertainty. Rather than building on the successes of the previous government and preparing the country for a downturn, it is pursuing short-sighted policies it can\u2019t afford and will hamper long-term growth.\n\nPoland\u2019s good fortunes are in large part the result of external factors.\n\nThe government\u2019s flagship project, known as 500+, is a case in point. The measure, which was introduced in 2016, presents families with children with a monthly subsidy of 500 zloty per child (about \u20ac115) free of personal income tax. At first, it covered just over half of children (around 3.6 million children) at an annual cost of 1.3 percent of GDP. In May, Law and Justice extended it to all children, raising the cost to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2020.\n\nThe measure, as experts warned before it was introduced, is inefficient and a waste of resources. It falls short of its stated goal \u2014 to incentivize young couples to have more children \u2014 and encourages women to withdraw from the labor market.\n\nRule of law\n\nThe ruling party\u2019s attacks on the rule of law are also doing major damage to Poland\u2019s long-term growth.\n\nBusinesses and investors have picked up on the fact that doing business in Poland holds political risks. While private investment has accelerated in other countries \u2014 including the Czech Republic, where it grew by 5.1 percent and Denmark, which saw a jump of 7 percent \u2014 it declined by 0.2 percent in Poland between 2016 and 2019. Previously \u2014 between 2013 and 2015 \u2014 it had grown by 5.6 percent.\n\nCompounding the problem is the government\u2019s campaign of nationalization and restricting economic freedom.\n\nThe Polish government has been buying up previously privatized companies, mostly in energy and banking, at an alarming rate. The share of banking assets controlled by state-owned banks has risen to more than 40 percent \u2014 a figure exceeded in Europe only in Belarus, Russia and Slovenia. This is a major risk to the stability and growth of the economy, as these banks will be susceptible to political pressure and could accumulate a large backlog of bad loans as a result.\n\nThe ruling party has also restricted economic freedom by banning businesses from operating on Sundays, introducing more complicated tax regulations and prohibited the sale of agricultural land. In the state sector, managers have been purged and replaced by party loyalists on a scale unprecedented in Poland after 1989.\n\nAdding to these missteps is the government\u2019s move to reverse an increase to the retirement age. Under measures put forward by the previous government, women\u2019s retirement age was due to increase from 60 in 2013 to 67 in 2040, while men\u2019s retirement age would go from 65 to 67. The government\u2019s new policy means there will be fewer people in the work force while more people draw pensions, financed \u2014 in Poland\u2019s system \u2014 by a shrinking number of workers.\n\nOff track\n\nWhat all of this means is that, in the event of a likely Europe-wide economic downturn, Poland will be less well-equipped to cope. To avoid a major slowdown and keep up with Western Europe, Poland urgently needs to implement a package of reforms that will set it back on the right path.\n\nIn the event of a likely Europe-wide economic downturn, Poland will be less well-equipped to cope.\n\nOver the long term, the rate of Poland\u2019s growth will depend on employment and labor productivity \u2014 both of which are dependent on the government instituting sound policies.\n\nPoland\u2019s working-age population is set to shrink by 0.8 percent annually between 2014 and 2040 \u2014 0.3 percent of which is a direct result of the Law and Justice Party\u2019s decision to lower the retirement age. If private investment, which is key to innovation, also continues to decline, labor productivity could suffer even more.\n\nTo turn things around, Poland must restore the rule of law, privatize the enlarged state sector and undo government monopolies, improve the climate for foreign direct investments, and engage in fiscal reforms, including \u2014 most crucially \u2014 raising the retirement age.\n\nIf Poland doesn\u2019t change course soon, the massive economic growth it witnessed after 1989 \u2014 one of the country\u2019s biggest achievements \u2014 will be a thing of the past.\n\nLeszek Balcerowicz is a former Polish deputy prime minister and finance minister, and a former governor of the Central Bank of Poland.
