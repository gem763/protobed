But there are serious obstacles.\n\nThe populists don't have a common platform, to put it mildly \u2013 their interests are diverging and their clashing personalities despise compromise.\n\nWe spoke to one of the foremost populist leaders in Europe, France's Marine Le Pen.\n\nHere's what she had to say.\n\nWe will actually come first in the European elections. Because we represent, in actual fact, a hope for Europe. This Europe, has driven people to despair, this European Union, with its incarcerative nature, its blackmail, its threats, and then its results are again very bad.\n\nBut there is another Europe to build, and to save Europe, you have to turn away from the European Union. Marine Le Pen President of the National Rally\n\nOne of the populists' arch-enemies is the center-right, in other words mainstream conservatives and Christian Democrats, who are the backbone of the Brussels establishment.\n\nTogether with Social Democrats and Liberals they control the European institutions and most national governments in the EU.\n\nTheir lead candidate is Manfred Weber from Germany, until now the chairman of the European People's Party group in Parliament.\n\nThis week Weber officially launched his campaign.\n\nSandor Zsiros was with him. His motto: The Power of We.\n\nBrexit\n\nTired of Brexit? Be patient, just a few more days.\n\nApril 12th is the last day until which London has to make a decision on a plan to exit the EU, as in the VERY LAST day, according to EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nOtherwise it's bye-bye Britain.\n\nUnless, of course, hell freezes over or Theresa May gets another extension at next week's special EU summit.\n\nSomething she has already asked for in a letter to EU Council President Donald Tusk.\n\nBefore that, EU leaders were adamant.\n\nNext week\n\nOn Monday, Italian populist leader Matteo Salvini launches his campaign for the European elections.\n\nHe has called on other nationalist parties in Europe to build an alliance in order to form a strong populist group in the next Parliament, ass mentioned earlier.\n\nOn Tuesday, EU and Chinese leaders come together for a summit meeting in Brussels.\n\nThe Europeans, who have often been divided over China, want to present a united front this time. But don't hold your breath.\n\nAnd finally on Wednesday, Brussels hosts the special EU summit on Brexit.\n\nIt might or might not be Theresa May's last ever EU summit \u2013 if Brexit is going to happen any time soon, that is.\n\nBefore we go, I want to give the last word to Donald Tusk, the EU Council President. His social media game has won over many - and this week he celebrated a milestone 1M followers. It's still a long way off former US President Barack Obama's 105M followers, but it's a start.", "description": "From the far-right to the center - politicians are setting out their grand plans and grand rhetoric for the European Union ahead of May's elections.
