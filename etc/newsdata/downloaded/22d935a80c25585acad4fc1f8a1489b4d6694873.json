There are a lot of storylines to this game.\n\nObviously we\u2019ve got Khalil Mack taking on his old team. Jon Gruden and the Raiders did Hard Knocks this year, so they have a lot of personalities and notoriety from that.\n\nThey\u2019ve had to really overcome a lot with the Antonio Brown issues, and this game in London is very important for them to get as a team.\n\nThey\u2019ve been here the entire work, they\u2019ve come together. It\u2019s the simple things - eating dinner together, playing cards, hanging out when usually you\u2019d just go to practice and go home.\n\nThis week they\u2019ve had nothing but each other, and it\u2019s underrated how important that is, especially for a team like the Raiders with all the issues they\u2019ve had to deal with.\n\n(Image: NFL)\n\nAs far as the match-up is concerned, everyone knows about this dominating Chicago defence. The Raiders need to give themselves a chance by starting fast.\n\nThe first 15-20 plays in their west coast offence will be scripted, and those will be what they consider their best plays and best match-ups.\n\nThey need to back up the Chicago defence with some vertical shots down the field, and scare them into backing off slightly.\n\nDerek Carr has not been great throwing the ball down the field so far, but that\u2019s not all on him and they need things to come together.\n\nPackers and Cowboys look to emerge as NFC contenders\n\nThe Green Bay Packers vs the Dallas Cowboys is a huge match-up for a couple of reasons.\n\nThe big thing is, we still don\u2019t know who the teams to beat at in the NFC. Both these teams are 3-1 and have a chance to become that team.\n\nA win here catapults them into the conversation for being one of the best teams in the NFC.\n\nAaron Rodgers is going back to where he won his Super Bowl, so he has good memories of being in Dallas.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThis Cowboys defence is phenomenal, especially if they\u2019re not on the field a lot. They just need their offence to have nice drives, control the ball with their run game and keep them off the field.\n\nThe Packers\u2019 biggest issue is that Devante Adams is hurt. He\u2019s been Aaron Rodgers\u2019 go-to guy. Who is going to step up and be that consistent passing threat he needs?\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to seeing this Dallas defence be able to slow down Rodgers. It\u2019s going to be tight, but that\u2019s the match-up I\u2019m looking for.\n\nThe Cowboys offence are going up against a defensive line which is much improved and likes to get after you in the pass game. They need to stick to running the ball and stopping them rushing the passer by using that play-action pass.\n\nRussell Wilson playing like MVP\n\nRussell Wilson is playing like the MVP of the league. That\u2019s how good he\u2019s playing right now.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t thrown an interception this year and he\u2019s just playing lights out.\n\n(Image: SIPA USA/PA Images)\n\nWhat\u2019s so significant is that when he\u2019s in prime time games, big games, when everyone is watching, he\u2019s phenomenal. When the pressure is on him, he\u2019s at his best.\n\nThat\u2019s what you saw on Thursday, a guy that does things well when plays have to change and he has to adjust. He\u2019s arguably the best in the league when things break down.\n\nWe saw a guy create plays and make throws all over the field with his pure athleticism and knowledge of the game.\n\nHe\u2019s been outstanding so far this season. It\u2019s fun to watch and I think we all hope he can keep up these standards.", "description": "Mirror NFL columnist JASON BELL looks at this week's London game between the Oakland Raiders and Chicago Bears as well as a huge NFC match-up", "authors": ["Jason Bell", "Image", "Nfl", "Getty Images", "Sipa Usa Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20500148.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Divisional-Round-Green-Bay-Packers-v-Dallas-Cowboys.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
