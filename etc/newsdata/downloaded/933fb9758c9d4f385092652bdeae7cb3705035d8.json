The Giants drafted him in the second round in 2016 before trading him to Pittsburgh after the 2018 season in a deal for Andrew McCutchen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty funny how that all worked out,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cIt was fun to get out there and play. It\u2019s cold, but I have my sleeves.\u201d\n\nJos\u00e9 Osuna added a sacrifice fly in the ninth for insurance.\n\n\u201cOur team\u2019s been fun to watch and hard to watch sometimes because we can break your heart and we can make you jump up and down,\u201d Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve done this.\u201d\n\nFernando Abad (0-2) gave up two hits and a walk while getting only one out.\n\nThe Giants were without All-Star closer Will Smith, shut down after experiencing some tightness throwing earlier in the day, manager Bruce Bochy said.\n\nThe Giants were 55-0 when leading after eight innings going into Monday.\n\n\u201cWe took advantage of the men they put at the mound,\u201d Hurdle said. \u201cFrom a professional standpoint, we handled our at bats, we made contact, we drove in runs and we won the game.\u201d\n\nRichard Rodr\u00edguez (4-5) pitched a scoreless eighth inning. Felipe V\u00e1zquez worked the ninth for his 26th save in 29 chances.\n\nBrandon Belt had three hits, including a two-run double for San Francisco. The Giants lost at home for the seventh time in eight games and fell to nine games below .500 at Oracle Park.\n\nThe announced attendance of 26,826 was the smallest at Oracle Park since April 12, 2010.\n\nBelt\u2019s\u2018 two-out, two-run double in the fifth broke a 1-1 tie.\n\nGiants starter Madison Bumgarner gave up two runs on six hits and two walks in seven innings.\n\n\u201cToo bad we couldn\u2019t hold on to give him a win,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cYou look at his body of work; he\u2019s been a savior. You have to those guys in charge. Guys who give you innings like that are invaluable - not just innings but quality innings.\u201d\n\nJacob Stallings homered for the Pirates.\n\nThe Giants took a 1-0 lead in the first when Evan Longoria singled in Mike Yastrzemski.\n\nBUSTER\u2019S BUNT\n\nGiants catcher Buster Posey recorded his first career sacrifice bunt when he advanced Yastrzemski in the bottom of the first after 4,539 career at-bats.\n\nSHORT HOPS\n\nReynolds\u2018 35th double tied Hall of Famer Paul \u201cBig Poison\u201d Waner (1926) for the Pirates\u2018 rookie record. . Giants center fielder Kevin Pillar took extra bases away from Osuna with a leaping catch against the wall with one out in the fourth. \u2026 Newman hit safely in 13 of his last 14 games, batting .429 (24-for-56) three homers and 13 RBI over that stretch.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nPirates: OF Starling Marte was out of the lineup with a left wrist sprain he suffered making a diving catch in Sunday\u2019s game against St. Louis. Manager Clint Hurdle said his status is day-to-day.\n\nGiants: RHP Reyes Moronta will undergo surgery on Tuesday to repair his injured labrum and capsule, manager Bruce Bochy said. The procedure will be performed by Dr. Neal ElAttrache in Los Angeles. . LHP Tony Watson underwent an MRI on Monday that showed a hairline fracture on his left wrist. Watson suffered the injury making a diving tag play in St. Louis on Sept. 5. He\u2019ll be reevaluated after wearing a splint for 10 days, Bochy said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPirates: RHP Mitch Keller (1-3, 8.18) left his last start on Sept. 4 in the second inning with a right wrist contusion after being struck by a line drive.\n\nGiants: RHP Johnny Cueto (season debut) will make his first start since undergoing Tommy John reconstructive surgery. The two-time All-Star hasn\u2019t pitched in a major league game since July 28, 2018.\n\n__\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bryan Reynolds finally made it to San Francisco, and he delivered.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gideon Rubin"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/pirates_giants_baseball_34212_c0-329-3472-2353_s1770x1032.jpg?cff23fa84b5ea460d1fc57331a38251b477e0a99", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
