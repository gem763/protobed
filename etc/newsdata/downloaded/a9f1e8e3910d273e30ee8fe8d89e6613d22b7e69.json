Pence was scheduled to speak at an event hosted by the National Association of Manufacturers and the glass manufacturer SCHOTT North America.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has talked tough on trade but has nothing to show for it, other than pain for America\u2019s families,\u201d Biden wrote to the paper. \u201cMike Pence has been his complicit sidekick, propping up Trump\u2019s trade wars and slighting hard-working Americans in Luzerne County and across the country.\u201d Biden, a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, also tweeted a quote from the statement shortly afterward.\n\nBiden also went after Trump\u2018s combative trade tactics, including trade wars with countries such as China. He accused the president of being more concerned with looking tough on the global stage than defending the well-being of working Americans.\n\n\u201cI know Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvanians will not be fooled by Pence\u2019s blind promotion of Trump\u2019s irresponsible trade wars,\" Biden said in an extended statement to POLITICO. \u201cThey understand that it is their workers, farmers, and manufacturers who are paying the price and feeling the pain.\u201c\n\nDuring his appearance in Duryea, Pence slammed back, accusing Biden and then-President Barack Obama of overseeing a decrease in 51,000 manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania during the last administration.\n\n\u201cWell, Joe, Pennsylvanians will not be fooled,\u201d Pence said to an audience of more than 200. \u201cThey know the USMCA is a win for Pennsylvania and a win for America. It\u2019s time you got on board. It\u2019s time to pass USMCA.\u201d\n\nPence has spoken at more than 30 events aimed at pressing lawmakers to pass the new trade pact, which still needs to be approved by Congress. House Democrats are currently negotiating with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in an effort to secure changes to the deal that would allow for Speaker Nancy Pelosi to put it up for a vote.\n\nAll top Democratic presidential candidates have said they do not support the USMCA in its current form. In his statement, Biden said the deal would be too generous to large pharmaceutical companies, while inadequately ensuring protections for American workers\u2018 rights.\n\nThe Trump administration, Republicans and business groups have been pressing for Congress to put the deal up for a vote before the end of the year. But it remains to be seen whether Democrats and Lighthizer will strike a deal that clears the path for Congress to consider the deal in the 23 legislative days left this year.", "description": "Vice President Mike Pence and former Vice President Joe Biden went head to head on trade Monday, both using Pennsylvania, a critical electoral state, to prove their opposing points on the efficacy of the Trump administration's new North American trade proposal.
