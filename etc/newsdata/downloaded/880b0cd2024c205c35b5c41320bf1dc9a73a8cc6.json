REUTERS/Murad Sezer/File Photo\n\nThe lira is no stranger to volatility, but this month\u2019s 5% dive against the dollar stands out when compared to a 1.3% gain for MSCI\u2019s Emerging Markets Currency Index. .MIEM00000CUS\n\nThe broader emerging markets rally has been underpinned by signs of a partial trade deal between the United States and China and by stimulus, but Turkey-watchers have been rattled by threats of international sanctions over its actions in Syria.\n\n(GRAPHIC - Turkey's lira worst performing currency over the last month: here)\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump warned on Sunday that \u201cbig sanctions on Turkey are coming\u201d having already threatened to \u201cobliterate\u201d its NATO ally\u2019s economy if Ankara\u2019s attack on the Kurdish-led forces in northeastern Syria went too far.\n\nEuropean Union governments also agreed on Monday to limit arms exports to Turkey, although they stopped short of a formal EU embargo on the country which has helped stem the tide of refugees from Syria and other nearby countries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m struggling to see a positive trigger event (on Turkey) at the moment,\u201d said Allianz Global Investors emerging markets CIO Richard House. \u201cIt is just quite staggering what is going on.\u201d\n\nInvestment banks have also turned against the lira again.\n\nJPMorgan identified the lira, along with Russia\u2019s rouble, as the most exposed to political uncertainties. Goldman Sachs has warned about geopolitics and domestic economic policy, while Rabobank last week questioned whether the lira might be on the brink of another \u201ccurrency crisis\u201d.\n\nDeutsche Bank cut its \u201cpositive\u201d view on Turkish fixed income and Oxford Economics downgraded its stance on Turkey.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. Congress opts to impose economic sanctions on Turkey, this relatively small move (in the lira) is likely to prove just the beginning,\u201d Rabobank\u2019s Piotr Matys said.\n\nROLLING RISKS\n\nThe lira\u2019s previous plunges dragged Turkey\u2019s economy into recession last year as interest rates soared in response.\n\nThe economy is now recovering but remains in a fragile state and the lira\u2019s latest shakes show it clearly remains vulnerable.\n\nIt slumped earlier this year after the dismissal of the central bank governor by President Tayyip Erdogan - a frequent meddler in monetary policy - and when Washington threatened sanctions for Turkey\u2019s purchases of Russian S-400 missile defenses.\n\nEven so, the currency had been doing better, helped by the Turkish central bank\u2019s efforts to steady it this year and supported by bonds that offered some of the highest interest rates on global markets.\n\nIt may also have been aided by a relative lull in dollar bond repayments in recent months. But that lull is about to come to an end with about $17 billion worth of repayments due across the economy before the end of year, Allianz estimates.\n\nThe worry is that, if the lira buckles again under the weight any sanctions, those payments become more expensive.\n\nS&P Global sovereign analyst Frank Gill said his key question was whether Turkish banks could roll over and refinance all of their upcoming dollar and euro-denominated debt.\n\nS&P estimates that, while Turkey\u2019s government debt is low at roughly 30% of gross domestic product, the amount of private sector debt needing to be refinanced or paid back over the next 12 months is equivalent to 20% of GDP.\n\n\u201cClearly the reason why the markets are focusing so much on the sanctions is that they are worried they are going to hit the banks\u2019 ability to roll over (their debt),\u201d Gill said.\n\n\u201cAnd that is going to hit the lira, and that is going to hit asset quality and the economy again, and it all spirals.\u201d\n\n(GRAPHIC - Turkey's rebound succumbs to sanctions stress: here)", "description": "The slump in Turkey's lira in the wake of the Turkish military advance into Syria has made it October's worst performing major currency, a move that looks even starker considering most emerging market currencies have powered ahead.", "authors": ["Tom Arnold", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440797107&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1FL", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
