It launched a cross-border offensive against them on Oct. 9 after Trump ordered U.S. forces out of northeast Syria.\n\nThe deal agreed with Putin, which builds on and widens a previous U.S.-brokered ceasefire, helped end the fighting.\n\nBut the SDF said in its statement on Thursday that Turkish forces had attacked three villages \u201coutside the area of the ceasefire process,\u201d forcing thousands of civilians to flee.\n\n\u201cDespite our forces\u2019 commitment to the ceasefire decision and the withdrawal of our forces from the entire ceasefire area, the Turkish state and the terrorist factions allied to it are still violating the ceasefire process,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cOur forces are still clashing,\u201d it said, urging the United States to intervene to halt the renewed fighting.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Defense Ministry did not comment directly on the SDF report but said five of its military personnel had been wounded in an attack by the YPG militia around the border town of Ras al Ain, near where the three villages are located.\n\nTurkey previously said it reserved the right to self-defense against any militants who remain in the area despite the truce, a pledge repeated by Erdogan on Thursday.\n\nA U.S. defense official said on Thursday that Washington was committed to reinforcing its military position in Syria \u201cwith additional military assets\u201d - one of the clearest signs yet that it had not just ended plans for a full withdrawal from Syria but may add capabilities to strengthen American forces remaining in the country.\n\nThe U.N. special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, told Reuters the ceasefire seemed to be holding \u201cby and large\u201d as major powers gather in Geneva ahead of the first meeting of Syria\u2019s Constitutional Committee next week.\n\nErdogan also said Turkey had agreed with Russia to maintain an \u201cobservation post\u201d on the northwestern part of Syria\u2019s Manbij.\n\n\u2018EVERYTHING IS BEING IMPLEMENTED\u2019\n\nRussia, a close ally of President Bashar al-Assad that has emerged as the key geopolitical player in Syria, has begun deploying military police near the Turkish border as part of the deal agreed on Tuesday in the Russian city of Sochi.\n\n\u201cEverything is being implemented,\u201d Interfax news agency quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin as saying.\n\nRIA, citing an SDF official, said the Kurdish fighters had already withdrawn to 32 km (20 miles) away from the border. It also said the Kurds were ready to discuss joining the Syrian army once the crisis in Syria had been settled politically.\n\nRussia will send a further 276 military police officers and 33 units of military hardware to Syria in a week, RIA news agency cited a Defense Ministry source as saying. It also quoted Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry as saying Russian military police had patrolled along a new 60-km (37-mile) route on the border.\n\nNext Tuesday, under the terms of the Sochi deal, Russian and Turkish forces will start to patrol a 10-km (6-mile) strip of land in northeast Syria where U.S. troops had been deployed for years along with their former Kurdish allies.\n\nThe arrival of the Russian police marks a shift in the regional balance of power just two weeks after Trump began pulling out U.S. forces, a move criticized in Washington and elsewhere as a betrayal of the Americans\u2019 former Kurdish allies.\n\nTurkey-backed Syrian rebels drive near the border town of Tal Abyad, Syria October 24, 2019. REUTERS/Khalil Ashawi\n\nTurkey\u2019s military operation was also widely condemned by its NATO allies, which said it was causing a fresh humanitarian crisis in Syria\u2019s eight-year conflict and could let Islamic State prisoners held by the YPG escape and regroup.\n\nAt a monthly U.N. Security Council meeting on Syria on Thursday, Syria\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Bashar Ja\u2019afari, slammed Turkey\u2019s military action and \u201cvehemently rejects attempts by the Turkish regime to justify its actions under the pretext of self-defense or countering terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe Russian deployments have also highlighted growing ties between Russia and NATO member Turkey.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper, speaking in Brussels on Thursday ahead of a NATO meeting, said Turkey - which annoyed Washington this year by buying Russian-made S400 missile defense systems - was moving in the wrong direction.\n\n\u201cWe see them spinning closer to Russia\u2019s orbit than in the Western orbit and I think that is unfortunate,\u201d Esper said.\n\n\u2018SUPER-POWER OF PEACE\u2019\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s lifting of sanctions on Turkey, distrust persists between Ankara and Washington, and a top Erdogan aide on Thursday criticized U.S. politicians for treating SDF commander Mazloum Kobani as a \u201clegitimate political figure.\u201d\n\nThe aide, Fahrettin Altun, told Reuters that Mazloum was a senior leader of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a decades-long insurgency in southeast Turkey and which Ankara\u2019s Western allies also deem a terrorist group.\n\nRepublican and Democratic U.S. senators urged the State Department on Wednesday to quickly give Mazloum a U.S. visa so he can visit to discuss the situation.\n\nErdogan said, however, he had told his justice minister to draw up papers demanding Mazloum\u2019s extradition.\n\nThe Turkish public has shown strong support for the military operation, encouraged by an overwhelmingly pro-government media.\n\nSlideshow (28 Images)\n\n\u201cThe super-power of peace, Turkey,\u201d said the main headline in Thursday\u2019s edition of the pro-government Sabah newspaper.\n\nThe incursion has deepened a sense of alienation, however, among Turkey\u2019s Kurds, which is also being fueled by a crackdown on the country\u2019s main pro-Kurdish party.", "description": "The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) accused Turkey on Thursday of launching a large land offensive targeting three villages in northeast Syria despite a truce, but Russia said a peace plan hammered out this week was going ahead smoothly.", "authors": ["Tom Perry", "Maria Kiselyova", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444553464&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N1IN", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
