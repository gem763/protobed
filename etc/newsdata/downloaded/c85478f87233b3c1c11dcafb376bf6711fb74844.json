We fought the challenge as a government to continue to move forward with the pipeline,\" she said.\n\nWhen Checkup host Duncan McCue said that Trudeau had only visited Edmonton once during the 2019 campaign and asked whether Alberta has been \"written off\" for this election, Hajdu responded \"absolutely not.\"\n\n\"The construction is underway [and] there are 4,200 jobs being created this year to build the pipeline,\" said Hajdu.\n\nHajdu says the Liberal Party remains committed to building the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. (Dennis Owen/Reuters)\n\nElectoral reform\n\nCalling from Edmonton, Josh Neary asked Hajdu whether Trudeau's 2015 promise for electoral reform might still be on the table.\n\nHajdu said that there are no plans to change the voting system in Canada.\n\nNeary told McCue that the promise of electoral reform was a motivation for him during the 2015 election. He added that \"Western provinces and Maritime provinces are widely under-represented\" under the current voting system.\n\nHajdu said the previous consultation with Canadians, including an all-party committee in the House of Commons, gave no consensus on how to change the system.\n\n\"The prime minister decided that given that the range of challenges that we're facing as a country ... we would not implement democratic reform and choose a new way to vote,\" she said.\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau waves to supporters as he boards his campaign bus in Richmond Hill, Ont., on Oct. 1.
