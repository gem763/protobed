Silver\u2019s rise is also impressive, with most-active Comex futures contract prices up about 17% for the quarter, at $17.912 an ounce on Thursday.\n\nNews of an earlier-than-expected Indonesian nickel-ore export ban led to nickel\u2019s rally, says Dee Perera, an analyst at Marex Spectron\u2019s LME desk. The ban was scheduled for 2022 but Indonesia confirmed late last month that the ban will be implemented on Jan. 1, 2020, she says.\n\n\u201cNickel\u2019s outperformance was driven by this metal-specific story,\u201d says Perera. She points out that on Sept. 2, nickel prices reached a high of $18,850, a level not seen since Sept. 2014\u2014when Indonesia first put a ban in place before relaxing it in 2017.\n\nStill, there is \u201csome skepticism around the impact that the Indonesian ore export ban has had on the price, with recent reports indicating that Indonesian miners can seek export quotas into year end,\u201d she says.\n\nAlso, production of China\u2019s \u201cnickel pig iron,\u201d which contains nickel and iron, has hit record highs in recent months and some analysts suggest that existing stockpiles and slowing demand should mean that nickel may avoid a significant deficit, Perera says. Near term, she says Marex Spectron expects support for nickel into the $16,690 area, which marked the April 19, 2018, and Aug. 8, 2019 high. An LME chart shows prices generally traded below that level between those dates. Meanwhile, silver\u2019s quarterly rally helped it catch up with gold\u2019s year-to-date price gain, with silver futures up 15% versus gold\u2019s 18% rise for the year, as of Thursday.\n\nBoth metals are \u201creal assets that benefit from economic and political uncertainty,\u201d says Maria Smirnova, senior portfolio manager at Sprott Asset Management. But silver has a lower price point and is also a much smaller market \u201cso it takes less dollars to move the price,\u201d she says. Given that, it \u201cusually outperforms gold in bull markets.\u201d\n\nThe silver-to-gold ratio, or the amount of silver ounces to one ounce of gold, fell to lows around 32 in 2011 and peaked around 95 in July of this year\u2014the highest ratio since 1991, says Peter Spina, president of silver news and analysis provider SilverSeek.com. \u201cIf we see the ratio just move back to the mid-point of the two extremes over the last several years, silver should be in the low $20s and thus still looks undervalued here from a gold perspective.\u201d\n\nDuring its pullbacks, silver has shown some \u201cgreat support\u201d under $18, though it could find difficulty getting into the lower $20s in the short term without gold prices reaching new highs, he says. In the coming months, Spina says silver could build a strong base around $18, with $20 to $21 as the \u201cnext major technical resistance,\u201d and he\u2019d be a buyer of silver at $18 or less.", "description": "Silver and nickel are shaking off worries over a slowdown in the global economy to score the largest percentage gains among major commodities in the third quarter.", "authors": ["Myra P.
