This system is peculiar in being much more significant in size and duration than the typical storm on Saturn, yet smaller than the known pattern of major storms that break out there periodically.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Deranged version of Earth\u2019: Scientists discover mysterious massive \u2018ice corridor\u2019 on Saturn\u2019s moon\n\nAbout once every year on Saturn (the equivalent of about 29 years here on Earth), a spate of swirling storms dubbed the \u2018Great White Spots\u2019 erupt during the north\u2019s summer period. However, the 2018 storms don\u2019t fit the pattern nor the intensity of these, and this new avenue of research could offer key insights into not just Saturn\u2019s weather, but our own.\n\n\u201cThis adds an important piece to the giant puzzle\u201d surrounding Saturn\u2019s atmosphere, Cassini Project Scientist Linda Spilker, who was not part of the study, told PBS\u2019 Nova. \u201cBy learning more about [Saturn\u2019s storms], we can maybe understand more of the weather on our own planet as well.\u201d\n\nLike this story?
