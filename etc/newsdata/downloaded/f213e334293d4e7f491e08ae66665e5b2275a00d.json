Yet, notwithstanding this, markets have pushed into territory of crazy valuations and perverse investment activity.\n\nTake Denmark\u2019s Jyske Bank, which recently launched the world\u2019s first negative interest rate mortgage \u2013 offering home loans at minus 0.5% a year on a ten-year mortgage. Negative interest rates effectively mean that a bank pays you to take their money. Over the life of the loan, you pay back less than you borrowed.\n\nThe insanity of \u201cupside-down banking\u201d had spread from bond markets where, recently, Germany sold the world's first 30-year bond offering a zero coupon. The German bond was issued on an effective yield of minus 0.2%, meaning investors are guaranteed to lose money on the thirty-year investment. In total, about half of all European government bonds have a negative yield, and globally there is $15 trillion in negative-yield debt.\n\nEquity markets also have produced some astounding valuations, seen in profitless initial public offerings (IPOs). Loss-making Uber came to market at a share price of $45 in May, valuing it at $82bn, or seven times annual revenue. The global average for all businesses is less than two times revenue. Likewise, shared-space office company WeWork announced a September IPO at a $47bn valuation, more than 25 times annual revenue \u2013 a staggering sum for a company that isn't profitable and may never make money.\n\nWhen valuations get carried away \u2013 whether bonds, equities, tech or tulips \u2013 it never ends well. Yet, investment decisions have become heavily distracted by breathless storytelling of new business models, disruptive technologies and quantitative easing, leading to lofty valuations.\n\nTo manage this risk and successfully navigate the current environment, we should remember that sound investment decisions are founded on a core principle of buying good assets at good prices. Importantly, the one doesn\u2019t replace the other: paying a low price for a bad asset is a bad investment.\n\nUtilising these criteria, the most loved destinations for investors with low risk appetites \u2013 cash and bonds \u2013 start to look risky. Negative interest rates are high risk. By contrast, precious metals \u2013 widely shunned for paying zero interest \u2013 might be a sensible bet. Consider that, at $1500/oz, the gold price has risen 26% over the past year, and silver almost 20%.\n\nIn equities, new business models might also be wearing the emperor\u2019s clothes. Uber came to market with the largest loss ever for an IPO. The share price is down 25% since listing, and there is a growing view that it may never produce a profit, potentially leaving the business worth substantially less than the $82bn price tag at IPO.\n\nIndeed, with excessive valuation marked as a key risk, the most sought-after equity markets \u2013 which include the loved US, safe Switzerland and fast-growing India \u2013 might also prove dangerous. Using cashflow, revenue, earnings and balance sheet valuations, these three markets are trading at substantial premiums to the world average. By contrast, snubbed China, stalled South Africa and sleepy Japan are trading at discounts of between 20% and 30% to the global average.\n\nEquity Market Valuations\n\nSource: Cannon Asset Managers (2019)\n\nThis isn\u2019t a case for throwing out US stocks in favour of Chinese stocks, or putting European bonds aside in favour of gold. But, with risk management as the foundation of investing, one of the primary risks that we can control is the price we pay for any asset. When the market is extremely optimistic, you need to be cautious; and when investors are pessimistic, that\u2019s when to look hard: when buyers arrive, it\u2019s too late to start looking, and when sellers arrive, it\u2019s too late to start selling.\n\nDigging into the detail of these markets throws up potentially rich payload. Consider Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Xiaomi. Apple, the world\u2019s second-largest company with a market value of $895bn and 12% of the smart phone market, is widely loved and admired. As a result, Apple trades at hefty multiples of 3.8 times sales, 18 times earnings and 10 times net asset value (NAV). By comparison, China\u2019s Xiaomi, founded in 2010, holds 8% of the smart phone market and is valued at 0.7 times sales, 9 times earnings and 3 times NAV.\n\nIn the space of a few years, Xiaomi\u2019s top-of-the range smartphones have caught up to Apple in performance yet retail at half the price. Indeed, the Chinese company is becoming increasingly known for its phenomenal value for money, pledging to earn no more than 5% profit on any of its hardware.\n\nPerhaps in selling down Apple, investors would also be well-advised to sell loss-making Uber in exchange for South African-listed SuperGroup which is trading at 7 times earnings, is below NAV (0.9 times), boasts a Level 1 BEE rating, has R3.5bn cash on its balance sheet against a market valuation of R10.2bn and earns half of its revenue outside of SA. Surely, this is a sweeter ride?\n\nAdrian Saville, Chief Executive, Cannon Asset Managers", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Cannon Asset Managers covering: Apple Inc.
