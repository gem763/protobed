A tough guy by the name of CornPop, leader of a Delaware gang called \u201cthe Romans\u201d, was waiting for him outside the pool.\n\nIn Biden\u2019s telling, CornPop was a \u201cbad dude\u201d who \u201cran a bunch of bad boys\u201d, was armed with a straight-razor and backed by other gang members. And he was threatening to \u201ccut\u201d the future vice-president.\n\nInstead of calling the police, Biden met CornPop and his cronies head on, having armed himself with a 6ft chain. After a standoff, CornPop backed down.\n\nOver the weekend, a 2017 video of Biden telling the engrossing tale surfaced on the internet. It met with widespread disbelief. Some questioned whether CornPop ever existed. Others were skeptical about the very idea of a chain-wielding Biden facing off with three armed gang members.\n\nIt turns out, however, that the presidential candidate might have been telling the truth. A former state president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) had supported Biden\u2019s yarn. So did a newspaper obituary.\n\nThe footage of the CornPop anecdote was filmed when Biden attended the renaming of a swimming pool and park in Wilmington. The former Delaware senator recalled that, as a young man, he had been a security guard there, one of very few white employees. He then launched into his story.\n\n\u201cCornPop was a bad dude and he ran a bunch of bad boys,\u201d he said.\n\nOne day, Biden recalled, CornPop refused to wear a bathing cap, flouting pool rules. Biden spotted him on the pool\u2019s 3m diving board, and decided to lay down the law.\n\n\u201cYou! Off the board, or I\u2019ll come up and drag you off,\u201d Biden shouted.\n\nCornPop came down but apparently was displeased \u2013 not least because Biden had also called him \u201cEsther\u201d, a reference to then-prominent swimmer Esther Williams.\n\nCornPop said he would be waiting outside. He was true to his word, Biden remembered: \u201cHe was waiting there with three guys [with] straight razors.\u201d\n\nActing on the advice of a man he described as a pool mechanic, Biden walked out to meet CornPop head on.\n\n\u201cI walked out with the chain. I walked up to my car,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI said: \u2018First of all \u2026 when I tell you to get off the board, you get off the board, and I\u2019ll kick you out again. But I shouldn\u2019t have called you Esther Williams, I apologize.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know if that apology is going to work.\u201d\n\nCornPop backed down, Biden said.\n\n\u201cHe said OK, closed the straight razor and my heart began to beat again.\u201d\n\nEvidence has emerged to support Biden\u2019s story. A longer clip of the 2017 event, published by local news channel WITN, shows former Delaware NAACP president Richard \u201cMouse\u201d Smith telling the same tale.\n\nCNN reporter Daniel Dale, meanwhile, found an obituary for a Wilmington man called William L \u201cCornPop\u201d Morris, who died in 2016 aged 73.\n\nIt is unlikely everyone will believe the story of Biden and CornPop. We do know, however, that Biden \u2013 at least according to himself \u2013 is unafraid of violence. In 2018 he suggested that in a hypothetical situation, Donald Trump would be in physical danger.\n\n\u201cA guy who ended up becoming our national leader said: \u2018I can grab a woman anywhere and she likes it,\u2019\u201d Biden told an audience in Florida.\n\n\u201cIf we were in high school, I\u2019d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.\u201d", "description": "Biden says he faced off gang leader armed with a razor blade in 1962 \u2013 a former state president of the NAACP supports his yarn", "authors": ["Adam Gabbatt"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4237e554c42b48c2561ef67fd62fd74accaa074a/0_215_4863_2918/master/4863.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=899281c8ebd8543b9833624f58a46c01", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
