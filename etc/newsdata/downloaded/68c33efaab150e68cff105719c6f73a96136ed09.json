(Photo: Gerry Broome, AP)\n\nThere will be riots, GOP candidate Donald Trump said after key primary victories on March 15, the most recent Super Tuesday, if he does not get the Republican nomination.\n\nThat statement wasn't the first time that Trump encouraged his supporters to use violence. The candidate has offered money to anyone willing to punch protesters (who show up at his rallies) in the face. Trump has also threatened to press charges against activists. Thomas DiMassimo of Ohio was charged with a misdemeanor (illegal entry on restricted grounds) after his arrest for rushing the stage during Trump's campaign speech March 12. The man could face a year in prison.\n\nPolice pepper sprayed another group of protesters in Kansas City. And cops removed black students from a rally on Georgia's Valdosta State University campus even though they had tickets to attend the Trump event. Some students were very emotional after the incident. Officers said they removed students from the auditorium at the request of the Trump campaign. The Trump campaign has denied that they made such a request.\n\nBlack Lives Matter supporters and protesters have condemned Trump's reaction to activists, the removal of students from the Valdosta event and the candidate's threat to press charges. A roundup of comments (on both sides of the issue) from social media:\n\n#Trump \"Make this country better\" is #Racist code for repress minority's and advance the Rich White Power structure of this country. #BLM \u2014 J.D. Green (@Cybts1) March 3, 2016\n\n#BernieSanders showed strength & compassion by letting #BLM have a voice at his rally. #Trump doesn't know real strength when he sees it. \u2014 Pat (@PatFromm) March 6, 2016\n\nIt's a shame it took #Trump campaign for some to see what people of color have been telling them about racism all along. #BlackLivesMatter \u2014 HSS (@HSSawakening) March 7, 2016\n\nFacebook comments edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nIf you care to remember, the BLM protests actually began months ago at Clinton and Sanders rallies. Don't recall any punches being thrown at those, though. Because it takes a bully at the top to enable their bully followers.\n\n\u2014 Abe Ellenberg\n\nI find it ironic that Trump calls himself a \"disruptor,\" yet doesn't like it when he meets ANY disruptive opposition. I do NOT condone violence, nor do I consider that free speech. But I do note that in any case of anyone disagreeing with Trump, he calls \"foul.\" As in, \"how dare anyone disagree with me.\" What he is missing is just how divisive and inciteful his commentary is. As usual, he accepts zero responsibility for his words. When he says he would like to choke out a protester, what do you think that says to his \"supporters?\" It says, \"whatever I want to do, I will, and you all back me, right?\"\n\n\u2014 Michael Anthony Shea\n\nI'm not a Trump fan by any means, but I'm sorry free speech is a right, hard fought for and won. You don't have to buy into the message if you don't want. But you should be able to listen to it. Kinda ticked me off when college kids admitted to planning the interruption. Just intimidation to block free speech.\n\n\u2014 Garth Hogan\n\nThanks #BlackLivesMatter! Was going to vote #Cruz in Florida Tuesday, but now voting for #Trump. If #BLM hates him, he must be doing right. \u2014 EJKorvette (@EJKorvette) March 12, 2016\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1prHukP", "description": "See what #BLM activists and Trump followers have said about the violence at campaign rallies.", "authors": ["Eileen Rivers", "Ellie Hartleb", "Published P.M.
