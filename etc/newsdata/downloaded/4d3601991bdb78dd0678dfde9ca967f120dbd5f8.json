William\u2019s first visit was with his mother, Diana, in 1993\n\nTake the photos of William in the pub (albeit with footballer Frank Lampard).\n\nAlongside it was a serious message: \u2018Imagine if we talked about mental health as much as we talk about football.\u2019\n\nThe Prince was using his public profile to highlight the shocking rate of suicide among young men. It was a PR masterstroke.\n\nThe Royal Family has been badly dented of late so positive images like these must be welcome in The Firm.\n\nIn the past 12 months, the Cambridges have also released pictures on social media of William hugging staff at the Royal Marsden Hospital, leaping for joy watching his beloved Aston Villa get promoted, and dishing up dinner at a homeless shelter.\n\nDown in the den: Thirty years after she was a Brownie, Kate has fun at the Scouts HQ in Gilwell Park, Essex in March\n\nSupport: After the Christchurch, New Zealand, terror attack, William visits a children\u2019s hospital in the city in April\n\nTeam spirit: An ecstatic William cheers on Aston Villa\u2019s Premier League promotion in May, left, while this delightful photo of George was released in July to mark his birthday\n\nWho\u2019s going to kick it off? England\u2019s manager Gareth Southgate (far left) and footballing royalty join the Duke for a discussion about men\u2019s mental health in May\n\nBut just two years ago the Duke\u2019s PR wasn\u2019t so rosy. He faced headlines such as \u2018Workshy Will\u2019 after he gave up his job as an air ambulance pilot.\n\nIn 2014 the couple were criticised for a \u00a31.5 million refurbishment of Anmer Hall and Kate was admonished after installing a second kitchen in their Kensington Palace apartment.\n\nNow \u2014 presumably following a strategy instigated by their communications team \u2014 the Cambridges have turned their image around.\n\nCome on, the Villa: George looks thrilled as his dad\u2019s favourite team beat Norwich City 5-1 at Carrow Road in October, left, while Louis, aged one, has a wild time at the Chelsea Flower Show\u2019s Back To Nature garden in May\n\nSmash hit: Sitting with UK tennis player Katie Boulter, the Duchess enjoys an unobtrusive Wimbledon visit\n\nEarly birds: The family takes a \u00a373 budget morning flight from Norwich to Aberdeen in August, left, while the Duchess and Bake Off star Mary Berry are pictured together at RHS Garden Wisley in September\n\nSocial media gives them a chance to engage with the public on a level beyond anything they can achieve via mainstream media.\n\nWith Instagram, they are in control of the images they post and \u2014 crucially \u2014 can build a relationship with young people. It\u2019s a wise investment.\n\nAfter all, this is the generation who will be around to support William when he becomes King.\n\nAnd if the number of followers\u2019 \u2018likes\u2019 is anything to go by, the public are loving what they see.\n\nA charming photo of Prince Louis in April, taken by his mother and released for his first birthday, got more than a million \u2018likes\u2019, as did little Charlotte\u2019s first day at her big brother\u2019s school, being delivered by her parents, just like thousands of four years olds all over the country.\n\nWilliam and Kate\u2019s carefully crafted new public profile is building a colossal fan base that will set them and the monarchy in good stead for decades to come.\n\nA piece of cake: Kate looks at ease in Deepdale Hall Farm, the home of the Brown family in Cumbria", "description": "PENNY JUNOR: Surrounded by England fans watching their team against the Czech Republic, he appeared like any other supporter with a pint in his hand and a smile on his face.", "authors": ["Penny Junor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/22/19711290-0-image-a-71_1571087859422.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
