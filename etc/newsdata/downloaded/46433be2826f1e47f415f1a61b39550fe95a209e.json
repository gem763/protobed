Sanders has previously released financing \u201coptions,\u201d such as a 7.5 percent payroll tax on employers, that together add up to about half of the projected cost.\n\nSanders and Warren both argue that middle-class people would end up saving money because their premiums and deductibles would be eliminated, more than balancing out the increase in taxes.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we will pay for every nickel of Medicare for All, and it will save the overwhelming majority of the American people, who will no longer pay premiums,\u201d Sanders told CNBC.\n\nBiden is instead pushing for building on ObamaCare by adding an optional government-run health insurance plan, rather than a mandatory one.", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is attacking Sen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/harrissandersbidenwarren_10152019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
