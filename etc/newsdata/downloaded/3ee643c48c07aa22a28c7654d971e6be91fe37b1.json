The only problem is that there\u2019s still very little on which to actually spend these purple space rocks.\n\nEridium was first introduced in Borderlands 2, where it served two very important purposes: expanding backpack space and ammo reserves as well as eventually purchasing entrance to arenas that housed the game\u2019s uber-hard raid bosses. In Borderlands 3, however, Eridium isn\u2019t quite as useful.\n\nUpgrading your Vault Hunter is instead done with cold, hard cash, and raid bosses haven\u2019t been added to the game yet. Instead, series mainstay Crazy Earl will exchange Eridium for cosmetic items \u2014 heads, skins, emotes and the like \u2014 and special \u201cAnointed\u201d weapons, which provide character-specific stat bonuses.\n\nThere\u2019s also a special slot machine in the game\u2019s main hub, Sanctuary III, that takes Eridium instead of space dollars or whatever it is the Vault Hunters use, but it\u2019s generally not very fun pulling the lever over and over again for the small chance that you\u2019ll get a piece of gear that\u2019s much easier to find farming bosses.\n\nThis week\u2019s event, \u201cShow Me the Eridium,\u201d only makes the currency\u2019s relative worthlessness that much more apparent. In addition to boosting the amounts of Eridium that drop, prices have also been reduced on items that can be bought with the mysterious stones \u2014 from what I can tell, Crazy Earl\u2019s wares have been marked down by 25 per cent, and the slot machine now costs five Eridium a pull rather than the usual 10.\n\nGearbox\u2019s patch notes mention that normal enemies will now also drop Eridium, which was previously exclusive to just Badass variants, mini-bosses, and bosses, but it wasn\u2019t enough to make a noticeable difference during my recent loot expeditions.\n\nAfter the fun of last week\u2019s festivities, which saw rare enemies make guaranteed appearances and drop unique loot, Show Me the Eridium is a bit of a letdown. Everything that Eridium purchases in Borderlands 3, from cosmetic items to Anointed weapons, can also drop from enemies and appear in chests. Furthermore, most hardcore players have already accrued a massive amount of Eridium, and without anything new to buy, the currency is practically meaningless.\n\nThe smart move for players is to simply hold onto whatever Eridium they earn during this event and wait for Gearbox to provide more opportunities to use it, whether that\u2019s via raid bosses or something special like modifying weapon attributes, a common request in the Borderlands community.\n\nAlthough Gearbox has been clear from the beginning that these weeklong events were simply the appetizers leading up to the big Halloween-themed Bloody Harvest celebration at the end of October, the offerings have so far been more disappointing than fun. I\u2019m still playing Borderlands 3 because I love Borderlands, but my ongoing commitment to the game hinges almost entirely on the next few updates.", "description": "We\u2019ve reached the third week of unique Borderlands 3 events, and this time around Gearbox has seen fit to tweak the numbers to make Eridium, a secondary currency that\u2019s much harder to find than regular money, drop more frequently.
