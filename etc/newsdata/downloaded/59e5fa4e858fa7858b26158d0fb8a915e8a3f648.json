The nation is beginning to see the ugliness of the establishment, people who believe they have a divine right (if they believed in the divine) to run the federal government. If that right is ever challenged, that\u2019s when the long knives come out.\n\nSecret testimonies, barring Republicans from calling their own witnesses or cross-examining the ones Democrats have subpoenaed, and now a federal judge\u2019s ruling that secret grand jury records from Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation must be turned over to House Democrats \u2014 this is how the establishment fights back.\n\nA Wall Street Journal editorial called it \u201cpolitical damage control\u201d when Democrats criticized a decision by the Justice Department to open a criminal investigation into the genesis of the Russian \u201ccollusion\u201d with the 2016 Trump campaign. From the WSJ: \u201cDemocrats know that the Hillary Clinton campaign paid Fusion GPS to dig up dirt on Mr. Trump, and Fusion hired former British spook Christopher Steele, who compiled a dossier of allegations about Mr. Trump from Russian sources that turned out to be false.\n\n\u201cWorse, Fusion funneled the dossier to the FBI, which used it to persuade the secret FISA court to issue a warrant to eavesdrop on Trump official Carter Page. Democrats now want to discredit any attempt to hold people accountable if crimes were committed as part of this extraordinary dirty trick.\u201d\n\nIf the trail of the Russian collusion fraud leads back to Democrats and the Clinton campaign, it will undermine the credibility of what Democrats are trying to do with Ukraine and Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call to its president during which he allegedly demanded Ukraine\u2019s help in digging up dirt on Joe Biden and his overpaid son, Hunter.\n\nIt is a charge the president has repeatedly denied.\n\nU.S. Attorney John Durham is heading a criminal probe. It appears the goal of the Democrats is to advance impeachment to a vote in the House before it comes out. To hurry the process along, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the full House will vote Thursday to begin the public phase of the inquiry. This will include the establishment of rules and due process rights for the president.\n\nOn his radio show, Rush Limbaugh got to the heart of the matter: \u201cI think what Schiff and Pelosi and this entire so-called impeachment inquiry is really all about is derailing the Barr investigation. And I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re in such a hurry \u2026 they\u2019re trying to convince the American people that Trump is guilty and should not be president before Barr and Durham and (Inspector General Michael) Horowitz have time to reveal anything. And there\u2019s one downside to what happened here. We now have an official criminal investigation. That means that Durham and Barr can impanel a grand jury. And this is why the (former FBI Director Andrew) McCabes and the (former CIA Director John) Brennans and the (former Director of National Intelligence) James Clappers are running around today in a near panic.\u201d\n\nThe unfairness of it all is what strikes many people. Polls are fluid; some indicating a majority favor the investigation, but oppose impeachment and the president\u2019s removal from office, especially this close to the next election. Let the people decide is the mantra one hears in some voter interviews.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s greatest weapon, other than truth, is what he has done for the economy, judges and the pro-life movement. Perhaps no Republican could have done it better. These are winning issues. The establishment knows it and that\u2019s why this horror movie continues to play out. Call it trick or trick.\n\n\u2022 Cal Thomas, a nationally syndicated columnist, is the author of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires, Superpowers and the United States\u201d (HarperCollins/Zondervan, January 2020).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
