Southwark SE1 2. Wembley NW10 3. Camden NW1 4. Slough SL0 5. Leamouth E14\n\nLeast polluted areas 1. Sevenoaks TN14 2. Biggin Hill TN16 3. Upminster RM14 4. Oxted RH8 5. Sevenoaks TN13\n\nNO2 is emitted by vehicle exhausts, factories and power plants and is now considered the cause of more deaths and health problems than smoking. It has been linked to dementia, infertility, slow childhood development, autism, obesity, miscarriage, depression, psychosis and decreased life expectancy.\n\nThe Prime Minister's new bill is expected to target fine particles known as PM2.5.\n\nThe particles have a diameter of one four-hundredth-of-a-millimetre or less \u2014 approximately 30 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair.\n\nBut they can penetrate deep into the lungs, and have been implicated in exacerbating lung and cardiovascular diseases.\n\nAccording to the European Environment Agency, PM2.5s are responsible for 37,800 premature deaths in Britain a year.\n\nThe single biggest source for these particles is wood-burning.", "description": "Boris Johnson said the Environment Bill - to be announced on Monday - would be a successor to the 1956 Clean Air Act passed in response to London's Great Smog.", "authors": ["Jack Newman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/01/19613566-0-image-a-31_1570840846723.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
