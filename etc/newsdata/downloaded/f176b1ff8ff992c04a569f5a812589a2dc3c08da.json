The Coronation Street villain is set to target his enemies Adam Barlow (Sam Robertson) and Ali Neeson (James Burrows) in a dangerous game of cat and mouse which he is determined to win.\n\nThe ruthless local has made some strong adversaries since turning to the dark side \u2013 and now he aims to destroy the relationship Adam has with Sarah Platt (Tina O\u2019Brien) as well as bringing him down along with Ali, who has also recently become suspicious of Gary.\n\nMeanwhile, as Ali harbours feelings for Maria Connor (Samia Longchambon), Gary also has his eye on the stylist and, as she gets drawn into his web and falls for him, a passionate ever could land her in serious danger.\n\nMikey North said: \u2018Gary is losing the plot a little bit. He is unstable and out of control so whatever he gets up to next, nothing would surprise me. It will be interesting to see whether or not Gary and Maria are with the wrong people.\n\n\u2018Maybe Gary does want to be with Sarah and Maria does want to be with Ali, that may be the thing but time will tell. But Gary and Maria have got a lot of stuff to come, it will be interesting to see whether this is going to alienate Maria from the street as Gary is not the most popular person right now. He does mean well with Maria and he loves his kids, he\u2019s not all bad!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Corrie spokesperson teased: \u2018There are tumultuous times ahead for both Adam and Sarah and Ali and Maria as Gary threatens to destroy both relationships, taking Adam and Ali down in the process. After losing Sarah to Adam, Gary is determined to take his revenge, and when Adam starts prying into Gary\u2019s dodgy dealings Gary decides it\u2019s time he took him down a peg or two.\n\n\u2018Gary may still have feelings for Sarah, and be burdened by guilt, but she crossed him and left him with nothing. The former squaddie\u2019s life has taken a turn since then but a scorned Gary makes a very dangerous enemy and Adam needs to watch his back.\n\n\u2018Revenge isn\u2019t the only thing on Gary\u2019s mind, he\u2019s looking for love again and when he sets his sights on Maria it soon becomes clear he\u2019ll stop at nothing to get what he wants. Maria and Ali\u2019s relationship hasn\u2019t been plain sailing and spotting signs of weakness Gary steps in and makes his move.\n\n\u2018Unaware of Gary\u2019s darker side Maria\u2019s flattered by the attention, seeing Gary only as a businessman and a great father to Jake. Like Adam, Ali has his suspicions about Gary\u2019s sudden turn of fortune but will he be able to warn Maria before she steps into the lion\u2019s den and does a deal with the devil?\u2019\n\nIt sounds like several people will need to watch their backs \u2013 but who will come out on top?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Gary means business in Corrie.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Coronation_Street_Autumn-b846_1572016320.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
