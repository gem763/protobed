This week \u2014 punctuated by the lightning-fast ramp-up of an official impeachment inquiry into the president \u2014 was different. By Tuesday, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally announced the move, it was clear to aides of most of the 18 at-least-semi-serious remaining Democratic campaigns that, with the country\u2019s attention squarely on Capitol Hill and the White House, they\u2019d suddenly fallen further off the national radar than ever before. By Thursday, that attention was even more intensely focused, and a handful of campaign operatives began ringing internal alarm bells so loudly that their candidates had no choice but to start reckoning with the painful reality that no one cares about them right now. By the end of the week, in campaign offices scattered across the country, senior-level operatives finally sat down in small groups to discuss what the path forward now looks like for their campaigns \u2014 or, in some cases, whether they have realistic ones at all. A senior aide to one campaign described his team\u2019s Friday gathering as \u201ca \u2018we\u2019re fucked, what do we do?\u2019 meeting.\u201d\n\nThe big-picture strategic concern for every campaign now is that no one has any clue how long the impeachment process will take, what kind of attention it will command, or which way its politics will break. (See: Joe Biden\u2019s team using Donald Trump\u2019s lashing out as evidence of Biden\u2019s electability \u2014 proving the president is most worried about the former vice-president in the general election \u2014 while much of the rest of the field quietly bets that the deluge of news about his son will sink Biden.) But the more immediate problem for almost everyone in the still-massive field not named Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or Pete Buttigieg is money. Specifically, having enough of it to maintain real campaigns for the next few months.\n\nThat\u2019s because impeachment, for this crowd, couldn\u2019t have come at a more delicate time: the end of the final quarter before most pols believe the race gets serious, and therefore the exact moment they were banking on generating as much coverage and attention as possible, to raise as much money as possible \u2014 to keep afloat for as long as possible, or to finally make much-needed campaign hires and investments just as voters start paying serious attention. Take Cory Booker, whose campaign manager, Addisu Demissie, circulated a memo last Saturday morning ringing his own alarm. He wrote that if the senator didn\u2019t raise $1.7 million in the final ten days of the quarter \u2014 which ends with September, on Monday \u2014 he would have to drop out, deprived of a \u201clegitimate long-term path forward,\u201d in Demissie\u2019s words. This show of vulnerability (a classic Booker maneuver, to those who know him best and are used to his attention-grabbing tactics) seemed to work at first: Money poured in, setting him up to hit the stated mark. Other campaigns watched closely for clues as to how to replicate that success, since Demissie had simply stated out loud what a handful of other campaign managers would admit only in private about their finances. But Booker\u2019s fundraising pace slowed as the week progressed, and as the impeachment inquiry comprehensively smothered attention to any other topic, including the Democratic primary and Booker\u2019s push.\n\nBooker may have raised enough in the first few days to survive. But the squeeze is now on.\n\n\u201cThe media, prior to this, was already making it a three-to-five person race, and now there\u2019s a solar eclipse of a story that will make it really, really difficult to drive any message,\u201d says Glen Caplin, who was a senior advisor to Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s campaign. \u201cThe entire conversation now is going to be driven around Trump and impeachment, and it\u2019s going to be a real challenge for candidates in the bottom five to get coverage, and even those in the top five to drive it on any given day.\u201d\n\nA senior aide to one candidate still in the race put it a little less delicately: \u201cIt sucks, actually. Impeachment\u2019s gonna kill anyone who\u2019s not a senator or in the top five. We\u2019re fucked.\u201d\n\nThe likely difficulty for candidates from El Paso to Minneapolis isn\u2019t just an inability to break through in the saturated national media environment, though that is one concern. (\u201cIt\u2019s been the most nationalized race I\u2019ve ever seen, driven by nationalized media coverage,\u201d said Caplin, who also worked for Hillary Clinton in 2016.) Instead, it\u2019s the subsequent lack of cash that begets a long-term inability to build up infrastructure in early-voting states and to invest in paid advertising, which a consultant to a middle-tier campaign characterized as the \u201cone way you can break through right now,\u201d since ads aren\u2019t dependent on the news cycle. And that doesn\u2019t just determine whether candidates can make it to the next few debate stages, a necessary hurdle to long-term viability. In fact, \u201cthe choices that are going to be on the ballot in February and March are being set now,\u201d said yet another senior aide helping lead a campaign struggling to stay afloat. \u201cThe main thing that is determining whether you can participate in that ultimate campaign is finances.\u201d\n\nSome candidates could raise money off their potential involvement in impeachment, most prominently the House members or the senators who could have a vote on Trump\u2019s ultimate fate. (Supporters of Kamala Harris, for one, have been highlighting clips of her past questioning of Attorney General Bill Barr.) But this has, for now, proven an unconvincing pitch for potential supporters, according to people familiar with multiple candidates\u2019 digital fundraising numbers.\n\nSo far, candidates are largely playing it safe and keeping their heads down \u2014 they\u2019ll answer questions about impeachment when asked, and issue statements, but no campaign has yet reset its messaging to be all about Trump\u2019s corruption or the investigation. Even billionaire Tom Steyer \u2014 who rose to national prominence in part by campaigning for Trump\u2019s impeachment, and who doesn\u2019t need to raise money but could use all the attention he can get \u2014 unveiled a new global climate plan on Friday, sticking to his pre-impeachment plan. Montana Governor Steve Bullock unveiled a public lands proposal. But as the week closed, some aides for other campaigns considered last-ditch direction changes at their \u201cwe\u2019re fucked\u201d meetings. \u201cYou basically have two choices: Say outlandish shit about impeachment, or do something so big that people have to pay attention. Hard to do at tier two or below,\u201d said one top strategist for a candidate who will, at least, make the next debate stage.\n\nAnd, as Juli\u00e1n Castro can attest, distinguishing oneself as especially aggressive on the investigations has little demonstrated upside for lower-tier contenders. The former Housing Secretary was the first candidate to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment in April, but he saw little if any polling bump from it. Warren, on the other hand, jumpstarted her struggling campaign in part by making a similar call after Castro.\n\nThe best bet for some such hopefuls, then, might simply be hoping the pace of impeachment news slows, and that this week\u2019s deluge proves atypical. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how long it\u2019s gonna last,\u201d said one strategist for a faltering campaign.\n\nCastro, for one, appears to have a similar wish. And he needs all the help he can get. \u201cI don\u2019t say this lightly,\u201d he wrote to supporters on Thursday. \u201cIf I don\u2019t make the next debate stage, it will be the end of my campaign.\u201d", "description": "The news-dominating impeachment of President Trump will make it even harder for already struggling Democratic presidential candidates to attract the attention and money they need to keep their primary campaigns alive.", "authors": ["Gabriel Debenedetti"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/28/28-dem-debate-klobuchar-booker.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
