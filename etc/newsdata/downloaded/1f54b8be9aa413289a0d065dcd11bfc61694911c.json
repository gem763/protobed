All four were people of colour, with only one born outside of the US.\n\nIn response to Walker\u2019s question, Munchetty said: \u201cEvery time I have been told, as a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism.\u201d She added that she was \u201cabsolutely furious a man in that position thinks it\u2019s OK to skirt the lines by using language like that\u201d.\n\nThe BBC said Trump\u2019s remarks were widely condemned as racist, and Munchetty was entitled to give her personal response. However, its editorial complaints unit (ECU) found she had breached editorial guidelines because BBC journalists were not allowed to \u201cgive their opinions about the individual making the remarks or their motives for doing so\u201d.\n\nThe letter to the BBC on Friday warns the decision will have a \u201cprofound effect on the future diversity within the BBC\u201d.\n\nIt says requiring BAME broadcasters to remain \u201cimpartial\u201d about how they feel about their experiences of racism is \u201cludicrous\u201d and that to require them to \u201cendorse racism as a legitimate \u2018opinion\u2019 is an abrogation of responsibility of the most serious nature\u201d.\n\nThe consequences of the decision are \u201cwidespread with implications for the entire media landscape in the UK\u201d, it says. The scope of its effect, the signatories say, is already evident in the \u201cunprecedented number of BAME media figures who have openly and publicly voiced their condemnation\u201d.\n\nThe letter states that the ECU \u201cdoes not reflect the diverse cultural views in the BAME communities in the UK\u201d, and that it should address its own levels of diversity.\n\nRacism is not a legitimate standpoint. When will the BBC learn that? | Micha Frazer-Carroll Read more\n\nIt calls on BBC management to support journalists and acknowledge there can be no expectation of impartiality over expressions and experiences of racism.\n\nIt says the ECU ruling failed to acknowledge that \u201cracism is not a valid opinion on which an \u2018impartial\u2019 stance can or should be maintained\u201d. For those who experience racist abuse, including Munchetty, \u201cbeing expected to treat racist ideas as potentially valid has devastating and maybe illegal consequences\u201d and is contrary to race equality and human rights legislation, it says.\n\n\u201cTo suggest a journalist can \u2018talk about her own experiences of racism\u2019 while withholding a critique on the author of racism (in this case President Trump) has the ludicrous implication that such racism may be legitimate and should be contemplated as such,\u201d it adds.\n\nThe letter\u2019s signatories, who also include the broadcaster and writer Afua Hirsch and the science journalist Angela Saini, say that BBC journalists have contacted them privately to express concern about the \u201cclimate of fear\u201d at the organisation and concerns over the consequences of their speaking out in support of the statement.\n\nAmong those who have also backed the presenter are the chancellor, Sajid Javid, who called the decision \u201cridiculous\u201d and added that Munchetty\u2019s reaction was \u201cperfectly understandable\u201d.", "description": "Corporation accused of racial discrimination after presenter reprimanded for Trump remarks", "authors": ["Caroline Davies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b1b9225a46e14a1c57768e08d2ab22084d28b74/709_647_1724_1035/master/1724.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e2985ec36e17cf8caee4c1f50b9651df", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
