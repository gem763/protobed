Being a \u2018mother\u2019, whilst hitherto always associated with being female, is the status afforded to a person who undergoes the physical and biological process of carrying a pregnancy and giving birth.\n\nThe dad who gave birth: \u2018Being pregnant doesn't change me being a trans man\u2019 Read more\n\n\u201cIt is now medically and legally possible for an individual, whose gender is recognised in law as male, to become pregnant and give birth to their child. Whilst that person\u2019s gender is \u2018male\u2019, their parental status, which derives from their biological role in giving birth, is that of \u2018mother\u2019.\u201d\n\nMcConnell, a Guardian multimedia journalist who had experienced gender dysphoria since childhood and realised he was trans in 2010, aged 23, said he was \u201csaddened\u201d by the decision in favour of the government and the registrar, which resisted McConnell\u2019s claim to be recognised as his child\u2019s father.\n\n\u201cIf it is upholding the status quo then I am really worried about what that this means not just for me but other trans people who are parents or who want to become parents,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt has serious implications for non-traditional family structures. It upholds the view that only the most traditional forms of family are properly recognised or treated equally. It\u2019s just not fair.\u201d\n\nMcConnell has long lived as a male, starting testosterone treatment in April 2013 and undergoing chest reshaping surgery in Florida. In 2016, he sought advice from a fertility clinic about becoming pregnant. His hormone treatment was suspended, which had the effect of reversing some of the gender-reassignment process, leaving him destabilised, which he described as a \u201closs of myself\u201d. His menstrual cycle restarted and he became pregnant in 2017 using sperm from a donor. He gave birth in 2018.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s journey to parenthood was captured in a recent feature-length documentary, Seahorse, a reference to the fish that reproduce through male pregnancies.\n\nThe judge praised McConnell for \u201cproperly and bravely\u201d bringing his case and said there was a \u201cpressing need\u201d for the government and parliament \u201cto address square-on the question of the status of a trans male who has become pregnant and given birth to a child\u201d.\n\nHe said existing legislation and UK and European human rights case law \u201cdo not themselves directly engage with the central question\u201d.\n\nIn July, McConnell\u2019s anonymity in the case was lifted following applications from news media organisations who argued the self-generated publicity around the pregnancy and birth in the film and the public interest in the question of how the state recognised parenthood meant his identity should be known.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s wish to be registered as his child\u2019s father plunged him into a web of different laws. His intrauterine insemination fertility treatment was governed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008, his gender reassignment was under the Gender Recognition Act 2004 and he registered the birth under the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953.\n\nThe registrar\u2019s insistence McConnell be registered as \u201cmother\u201d appeared to him to be a result of an administrative need for every child to have a registered mother and was a breach of McConnell\u2019s rights under the Human Rights Act 1998, his lawyers argued. Finally, those acting for the child applied under the Family Law Act 1986 for a declaration that McConnell was his father.\n\nMcFarlane concluded the decision to register McConnell as a mother did not breach his or his child\u2019s human rights and, given the Gender Recognition Act was both retrospective and prospective, it was also in line with that law.\n\nThe Aire Centre, a legal charity that helps people assert their human rights, also intervened in the case to highlight the right of children to be protected from discrimination due to the sexual orientation or gender identity of their parents, as well as children\u2019s right to know their lineage.", "description": "Ruling in Freddy McConnell case is first legal definition of a mother in English common law", "authors": ["Robert Booth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/472b406ffa1983529ee3c9052ec35add69e64d4c/255_272_2345_1407/master/2345.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a750a2e9fa2bd07e884a2eb5e175cfc5", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
