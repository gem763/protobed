Navy Capt. Brook DeWalt, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the U.S. troops \u201ccame under artillery fire\u201d but were unharmed and that there was an explosion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe U.S. demands that Turkey avoid actions that could result in immediate defensive action,\u201d DeWalt said.\n\nIn a statement issued Friday, Turkey\u2019s Defense Ministry said its troops had not fired on the Americans and were acting \u201cin self-defense\u201d after one of their border posts was attacked.\n\nBut the situation, first reported by Newsweek, was more serious than characterized Friday, several officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nOne Army officer who has deployed to northeastern Syria and has knowledge of the situation said that multiple rounds of 155mm fire were launched from Turkey\u2019s side of the border and that they had a \u201cbracketing effect\u201d in which shells landed on both sides of the U.S. outpost.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an area weapon,\u201d the officer said, noting its explosive effects. \u201cThat\u2019s not something we ever would have done to a partner force.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe officer said Turkey knew there were Americans on the hill and that it had to be deliberate. The service members vacated the outpost after the incident but returned Saturday, according to a U.S. official and images circulating on social media.\n\n\u201cWe had been there for months, and it is the most clearly defined position in that entire area,\u201d the officer said.\n\nBrett McGurk, a former special envoy for both the Obama and Trump administrations in the campaign against the Islamic State, raised concerns about the incident Friday, saying on Twitter that the United States had declared the position to Turkey.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis was not a mistake,\u201d he said.\n\nMcGurk, who often collaborated with the U.S. military in Syria before resigning his position in December, emphasized the increasing risks to Americans throughout Syria in an email Saturday.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTurkey wants us off the entire border region to a depth of 30 kilometers,\u201d or about 20 miles, he said. \u201cBased on all the facts available, these were warning fires on a known location, not inadvertent rounds.\u201d\n\nTurkey launched its operation into Syria on Tuesday, two days after President Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed the issue in a phone call and the White House announced that the United States would not stand in Turkey\u2019s way. Trump, explaining his decision, said Monday that he wants to end \u201cendless wars\" in the Middle East.\n\nAD\n\nThe move immediately raised concerns that the United States was abandoning Syrian Kurds, who have been the closest U.S. partner in counterterrorism operations against the Islamic State. The Kurdish militia known as the People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG, has formed the backbone of U.S. efforts in northeastern Syria and collaborated with U.S. troops, but Turkey considers the group to be part of a Kurdish movement, the PKK, that it deems a terrorist organization.\n\nAD\n\nTurkey said in its statement that it opened fire after Kurdish forces launched rounds at them but stopped when the United States warned that the rounds were too close. U.S. officials confirmed Saturday that the firing ended after U.S. forces contacted the Turks, but some questioned whether the Kurdish were involved at all.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters Friday they would not abandon the Kurds but acknowledged the Pentagon has withdrawn forces from Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn in response to Turkey\u2019s incursion between the two border towns.\n\nAD\n\nTurkey appears to have aspirations to push the United States away from Kobane, as well, several officials said. The Army officer with knowledge of Syria said Turkish forces previously have launched artillery over the border near U.S. forces.\n\nAD\n\nMilley, speaking Friday at the Pentagon shortly before the incident outside Kobane, said the Turkish military \u201cis fully aware, down to explicit grid coordinate detail,\" of the location of U.S. troops in Syria. He said senior U.S. military officials are coordinating with the Turks \u201cto make sure that they know exactly where American forces are.\u201d\n\nAnother U.S. defense official, also speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the Pentagon \u201cobviously\u201d told Turkey where U.S. troops are and \u201cthey certainly [went] closer than we would have liked\u201d in the incident outside Kobane.\n\n\u201cWhether that\u2019s intentional or reckless, either way it\u2019s troubling,\u201d the official said.\n\nLiz Sly contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "'That was not a new position,' said one U.S. Army officer who served in Syria.", "authors": ["Dan Lamothe", "Reporter Covering The Pentagon", "The U.S. Military"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XndoIWBMiaZeLsOlIOrhtKsHcR0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/73D4QTHNB4I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
