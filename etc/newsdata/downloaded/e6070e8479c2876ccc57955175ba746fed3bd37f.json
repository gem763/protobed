The estimates are based on the group\u2019s calculations of results posted outside polling stations.\n\nThe Frelimo party, in power since the end of Portuguese colonial rule in 1975, looks set to dominate the parliamentary elections and may win most of the 10 provincial governor positions, according to the civic group, the Center for Public Integrity.\n\nRenamo\u2019s Momade is in a tight race for governor of Nampula, Mozambique\u2019s most populous province, according to unofficial results.\n\nThe reports of a landslide victory for Frelimo come despite a tightly fought campaign, where large rallies suggested Renamo\u2019s popularity, especially in central and northern Mozambique.\n\nHowever, the Oct. 15 elections were marked by restrictions on observers and several reports of suspected ballot stuffing with some people apprehended carrying backpacks with ballots marked for Frelimo.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s observer mission criticized many aspects of the election, including lack of independent monitors of the vote-counting process.\n\n\u201cThe absence of national observers in almost half of observed polling stations did not contribute to the transparency of the process,\u201d said chief EU observer S\u00e1nchez Amor.\n\nThe apparent magnitude of Frelimo\u2019s win was criticized by some independent analysts.\n\n\u201cA crushing electoral victory for Frelimo and president Filipe Nyusi \u2026 will divide the country and push a lasting peace further away,\u201d said Nathan Hayes, analyst for the Economist Intelligence Unit. \u201cFrelimo victories in the historical opposition strongholds of Sofala, Zambezia, Manica, Nampula and Tete provinces \u2026 would be a serious setback for the country\u2019s peace process and multiparty democracy.\u201d\n\nIf Renamo rejects the election results, it would be a severe blow to efforts to establish peace across Mozambique. A peace accord between Renamo and the government was signed in August, but an estimated 5,800 armed rebels loyal to Renamo have not yet turned in their weapons. A group purporting to represent those rebels have already warned that they will not disarm if they do not view the election as fair.\n\n___\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa", "description": "BILENE, Mozambique (AP) \u2014 Unofficial results in Mozambique's elections point to sweeping victories for the ruling Frelimo party and Presidenti Filipe", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/17/35e684_mozambique-elections-13596-in-tuesday-oct-15-2019-photo-vote-counting-takes-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
