(Image: Emma McIntyre, Getty Images)\n\nWith Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, director Destin Daniel Cretton isn\u2019t just crafting the Marvel Cinematic Universe\u2019s first feature with a predominantly Asian cast, he\u2019s also presenting a narrative that explores the relationships that exist between Asian characters of related, but distinctly different, ethnic backgrounds.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Observer, Cretton explained how one of the things he\u2019s most excited for about Shang-Chi is the simple fact that the film\u2019s going to star a cast of Asian actors from a variety of backgrounds who are finally going to be able to play the kinds of superhero roles Asian actors historically have never really had the opportunity to:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting to me to be able to fill a movie like that with a bunch of Asian faces and be able to see of sides of these character than what we have seen before. Growing up, I didn\u2019t have a super hero that looked like me and it\u2019s really exciting to give a new generation something I did not have. I couldn\u2019t be more excited.\u201d\n\nObviously, Simu Liu\u2019s titluar Shang-Chi will be the centrepiece of the film, but Cretton explicitly mentioned the villainous Mandarin, set to be played by Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, as a character who he\u2019s particularly interested in fleshing out in ways that will elevate him beyond his racist roots in Marvel\u2019s comics:\n\n\u201cI think [Leung] brings a humanity that we need for that character. We are not looking to contribute anymore to the Asian stereotypes that we have seen both in cinema and pop culture. We\u2019re hoping to just show some different sides to both Asian-Americans and Chinese-Americans and Mainland Chinese characters. Tommy is such an incredible actor and I\u2019m excited to have him help us break some of those stereotypes because that villain could easily become a punchline.\u201d\n\nWhile Cretton didn\u2019t explicitly mention Iron Man 3's \u201cspin\u201d on the Mandarin played by Ben Kingsley, the director\u2019s comments apply just as much to that iteration of the character as they do to his comics counterpart who was based on the racist Fu Manchu stereotype.\n\nWhile Kingsley\u2019s (false) Mandarin was markedly toned-down in terms of his overall Fu Manchu-ness, he was still presented as an alcoholic, drug-using lout for comedic effect, placing him squarely in caricature territory all the same.\n\nThe Mandarin\u2019s become a much more interesting and less racist character in Marvel\u2019s comics in recent years, and it sounds like Crettons intends to do the same for him in his MCU form \u2014 which, let\u2019s be honest, is long, long overdue.", "description": "With Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, director Destin Daniel Cretton isn\u2019t just crafting the Marvel Cinematic Universe\u2019s first feature with a predominantly Asian cast, he\u2019s also presenting a narrative that explores the relationships that exist between Asian characters of related, but distinctly...", "authors": ["Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/swhehi71d0ajllboqmdy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
