A further 868 died during the second from 21 to 27 July.\n\nMs Buzyn said that 10 people had died while at work.\n\nDuring the summer, red alerts - the most severe warning category - were issued in several areas of France.\n\nDuring hot periods, many schools and public events were closed to minimise public exposure.\n\nLarge parks and swimming pools were also kept open in some cities to help people stay cool. Paris authorities organised emergency phone lines and set up temporary \"cool rooms\" in municipal buildings.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why is it so hot and is climate change to blame?\n\nThe heat spurred wildfires in neighbouring Spain, with Catalonia experiencing some of its most devastating blazes in 20 years.\n\nAll-time high temperatures were also recorded in other European countries, including the UK, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.\n\nNo other country has yet released official data on deaths caused by this year's heatwaves.", "description": "France's health ministry says preventative measures helped to curb damage from the heat.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/100A/production/_108660140_hi055484320.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
