Overall, HBO won the most Emmys out of all networks nominated, with 34 total wins, followed by Netflix (27) and Amazon Prime Video (15).\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nBy comparison, traditional broadcast networks lagged, and NBC was the only broadcaster to take home any primetime Emmys wins: Overall, NBC took seven wins (with two for primetime), followed by CBS (four), Fox (four), The CW (four), and ABC (one).\n\nIt could become harder for HBO to maintain that dominance as Netflix, Amazon, and now Apple invest in developing high-quality original content for their platforms. Last year marked the first time in 17 years that HBO didn't win the most Emmys, tying the race with Netflix with 23 total wins.\n\nAlthough HBO continued to lead the race this year, two of the shows that enabled the premium cable outlet to dominate \u2014 \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Veep\" \u2014 are ending their runs, after generating a significant number of nominations and wins for the network. This year, \"Game of Thrones\" scored 32 total nominations, the most noms of any program in a single year, and also topped total wins by a program (10).\n\nIn the course of its eight seasons, \"Game of Thrones\" has accounted for 161 total nominations. HBO losing its top-performing shows gives deep-pocketed giants like Netflix, Amazon, and Apple an opportunity to take more Emmys ground from the premium cable giant, which could translate to greater cultural cachet and subscriber growth.\n\nThe shift in top Emmy-winning networks is additional proof that linear TV networks will increasingly no longer be where the highest value content is distributed. In recent years, Netflix and other streaming giants including Amazon and Hulu have made inroads into awards that had been long dominated by traditional broadcast and cable networks.\n\nFurther, we could see the network leaderboard change as media companies themselves launch direct-to-consumer streaming services like Disney+, HBO Max, and Peacock where they'll feature original series, which could lure nominations. That would represent a significant transfer of cultural attention, investment, and talent, in which media companies will increasingly put their highest value content in direct-to-consumer environments rather than on linear TV networks.\n\nIf awards shows continue to indicate that the best content can't be found on traditional television, viewer migration to streaming could accelerate. Cord-cutting is still on the rise \u2014 about 2 million US TV households have cut the cord so far in 2019 \u2014 and about 60 million TV households will be cordless by 2024, per a Roku study.\n\nIf content is king, awards nominations and wins can be indicators of who holds power in the media and cultural landscape \u2014 clout that could eventually translate to greater defections from traditional TV as viewers migrate to premium services to access the most compelling shows.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
