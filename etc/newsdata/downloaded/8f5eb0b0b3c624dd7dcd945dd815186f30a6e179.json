Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren each announced second-quarter fundraising of about $25 million, and former Vice President Joe Biden raised more than $15 million.\n\nOutside of the top tier, Sen. Kamala Harris raised $11.6 million in the past three months, businessman Andrew Yang raised $10 million and Sen. Cory Booker raised more than $6 million. Sen. Amy Klobuchar raised $4.8 million from July through September.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s slumping fundraising came despite the campaign\u2019s increased effort on fundraising and a furious late-quarter fundraising push, even as he poked fun at some of his competitors for their appeals.\n\nSpeaking at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin during the closing days of the fundraising quarter, O\u2019Rourke joked he could \u201cmaybe do a Facebook Live stream with a kitten, and say, \u2018You know, now we don\u2019t want anything to happen to the kitten. So, send your five dollars, your 10 dollars, your 15 dollars in now and Miss Whiskers is going to be fine.\u2019\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign then tweeted, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna do that, but if you want to donate, here\u2019s a link.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke and his campaign manager, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, are expected to discuss the state of the campaign in an all-staff call on Friday afternoon, which they are inviting supporters to listen to. They are expected to argue that O'Rourke is not yet widely known to the electorate and that they have time to change the dynamic of the race.\n\nThey are also emphasizing outreach to non-traditional voters who the campaign believes are not always accounted for in polls.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/bb/66/7d5c6f2c4a9285102e43204ac082/1011-orourke-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
