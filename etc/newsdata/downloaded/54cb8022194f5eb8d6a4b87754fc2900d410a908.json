When England\u2019s King Charles II discovered a failed 1683 assassination plot against himself and his brother, he beheaded the plotters and started arresting opponents. Among the targets was Locke, who knew some of the conspirators but likely wasn\u2019t involved. Fearing for his life, Locke fled to the Netherlands. Before leaving, he deposited several manuscripts with Edward Clarke, a member of Parliament and trusted friend.\n\nOne of those manuscripts has only now been discovered\u2014in the Annapolis, Md., library of St. John\u2019s College. This month it was published for the first time, in the Cambridge Historical Journal, by independent scholar J.C. Walmsley and Cambridge University fellow Felix Waldmann.\n\nThe title of the work, written in 1667 or 1668, is \u201cReasons for Tolerateing Papists Equally with Others.\u201d Mr. Walmsley tells me that when he came across the title in a 1928 book catalog, it seemed \u201cvery unlikely that this was actually a real thing that Locke had actually written.\u201d In one of Locke\u2019s most famous works\u2014the 1689 \u201cLetter Concerning Toleration,\u201d which helped shape the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\u2014he had taken a liberal view of religious tolerance for Protestant sects persecuted by the Anglican Church, but excluded Catholics and atheists.\n\nMr. Walmsley\u2019s research revealed that there was a single manuscript with the title \u201cReasons for Tolerateing Papists Equally With Others\u201d in the St. John\u2019s collection. Librarians there sent him an electronic copy, and he immediately recognized Locke\u2019s handwriting. He plugged the text into search engines and found that no one had ever quoted or printed it before. He flew to Maryland to examine it in person.\n\nJohn Locke (1632-1704).

Walmsley and Waldmann found that the manuscript likely remained in the hands of Edward Clarke\u2019s descendants until 1922, when it \u201cwas consigned to Sotheby\u2019s . \u201d It changed hands several times, they report, before a New Yorker named Henry MacDonald presented it to St. John\u2019s \u201cat a time we cannot determine.\u201d\n\nWhy St. John\u2019s? The scholars can only speculate. Mr. Waldmann thinks it may have to do with Maryland\u2019s founding by Lord Baltimore as a haven for persecuted Catholics. The manuscript shows Locke weighing the question of toleration for Catholics with more solicitude than in any of his other writings. He considers whether \u201cPapists can be supposd to be as good subjects as others\u201d and wrote that \u201cIf abilitys alone ought to prefer men to imployment\u201d\u2014that is, under a meritocracy\u2014\u201cPapists are to be tolerated.\u201d This was a radical sentiment in England at the time.\n\nIn the piece\u2019s lengthier second part, Locke arrives at his well-known position that toleration of Catholics is impossible. The reason, he suggests, isn\u2019t religious but political: It \u201cis not the difference of their opinion in religion, or of their ceremonys in worship,\u201d that justifies persecution of Catholics, Locke writes, \u201cbut their dangerous & factious tenents in reference to the state.\u201d Locke feared that Catholics\u2019 \u201csubjection to a forraigne infallible power\u201d\u2014the pope\u2014meant they could not be loyal to the British government.\n\nLocke was not an \u201cabstracted philosopher contemplating at a distance from political events,\u201d Mr. Waldmann says. He was an active player in the religious and political controversies of the British Restoration. His philosophy evolved against the backdrop of religious wars in Britain and across Europe after the Protestant Reformation. He had seen the bloodshed that followed when the state concerned itself not only with protecting citizens\u2019 life, liberty and property but also with the salvation of their souls.\n\nThe American Founders took Locke\u2019s views to heart. They banned the establishment of a national church, though that was the norm in Europe. They drew even more heavily on Locke\u2019s \u201cSecond Treatise of Government,\u201d which Thomas Jefferson paraphrased at length in the Declaration of Independence. Yet today Locke seems to be falling out of fashion. Progressives have lost much of their interest in the Western canon; for some of them, the most significant thing about Locke is that he had a financial interest in the slave trade.\n\nConservatives are also turning against Locke. Two acclaimed 2018 books\u2014\u201cWhy Liberalism Failed\u201d by Patrick Deneen and \u201cThe Virtue of Nationalism\u201d by Yoram Hazony \u2014assail Locke at length for being too disconnected from tradition and too focused on individual autonomy.\n\nClaire Arcenas, a historian at the University of Montana, tells me Locke\u2019s American interpreters have appealed to him for different purposes in different contexts. Locke wrote before the rise of modern capitalism, but some in the early 20th century presented Locke \u201cas a kind of proto-socialist\u201d because of his writings on labor. In the Cold War, conservatives emphasized Locke\u2019s \u201ccommitments to private property\u201d as evidence of his \u201cproto-capitalist\u201d views. In 2014, historian Michael Lind argued that 21st century Western populists are drawing without knowing it on Locke\u2019s idea of popular sovereignty. Ms. Arcenas says \u201cto think about who Locke is right now is probably different than who Locke was five years ago and who he will be in five years.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an indicator of how far Locke has faded from view that the discovery of an original Locke manuscript has so far gone without mention in the major press. \u201cImagine if you had the standard edition of Shakespeare \u2019s \u2018Hamlet,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Waldmann says, \u201cand then Craig [Walmsley] goes out and finds a lost act to the play.\u201d One reason for the quiet reception is that the free-market right that embraced Locke in the 20th century is beleaguered, and the leftward drift of mainstream culture has made critiques of Western society more prestigious than efforts to understand its foundations.\n\nThe manuscript\u2019s journey from England to the U.S. 250 years after its composition, Mr. Waldmann says, is \u201csymbolic of Locke\u2019s reception in that era in the 20th century.\u201d He was a giant of American liberal democracy standing against totalitarian rivals. Today he is metaphorically in exile. His literal exile from England lasted only six years\u2014in 1689, after the Glorious Revolution, he returned to England on the same boat as Queen Mary. Perhaps this discovery of a piece of his thought heralds a similarly swift return in the American imagination.\n\nMr. Willick is an assistant editorial features editor at the Journal.", "description": "A new manuscript is located in Maryland.
