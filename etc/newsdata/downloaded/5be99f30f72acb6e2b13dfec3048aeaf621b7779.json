Miami averted a three-game sweep and finished 4-15 against Washington this year.\n\nAustin Dean started the Marlins\u2019 comeback by leading off the seventh with his fifth homer against Strickland. Following a hit batsman and a walk, Jon Berti hit a two-run double off Suero to put Miami ahead, and Castro\u2019s hit capped the rally.\n\nWashington starting pitcher Austin Voth drove in a run with a single for his first major league hit and left after five innings with a 3-1 lead. The Nationals have lost his past four starts.\n\nJeff Brigham, helped when left fielder Harold Ramirez robbed Adam Eaton of a hit, pitched a perfect ninth for his first career save. Starter Pablo Lopez allowed three runs in five innings and remained winless since June 15, before he was sidelined for more than two months by a shoulder injury.\n\nThe Nationals started the game with three consecutive singles to take a 1-0 lead, but a nifty 3-6-1 double play helped Lopez escape further damage.\n\nWashington finished 43-38 on the road.\n\nON FURTHER REVIEW\n\nA call overturned by replay helped the Nationals score a run in the fourth. Victor Robles hit into an apparent inning-ending double play, but the Nationals\u2019 challenge of the forceout at second was upheld. That extended the inning, and Voth hit an RBI single for a 3-1 lead.\n\nFUTURE CONSIDERATION\n\nMarlins center fielder Magneuris Sierra, who has been staking a claim this month to consideration for a spot in the lineup next year, had a double and a triple and robbed Eaton of an extra-base hit. Sierra hiked his average to .350 in 15 games but left in the eighth with an apparent leg injury.\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nNationals infielder Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera, who hurt his right ankle on a play at the plate Saturday, struck out as a pinch hitter in the eighth.\n\nATTENDANCE\n\nThe announced crowd was 19,702, hiking the season total to 811,302. That\u2019s an increase of 198 over 2018, but the Marlins finished last in the National League in attendance for the 14th time in the past 15 years.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNationals: They have eight games to go, all at home, and begin a five-game series against the Phillies on Monday with LHP Patrick Corbin (13-7, 3.10) scheduled to start. Washington is 3-0 in Corbin\u2019s starts against Philadelphia this year.\n\nMarlins: They have seven games left, all on the road, and start a four-game series Monday at the Mets with LHP Caleb Smith (9-10, 4.24) scheduled to start.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Three relievers each gave up an extra-base hit in a seventh-inning meltdown Sunday, and the Washington Nationals' streak of 11 consecutive wins against the Miami Marlins ended with a 5-3 loss that tightened the NL wild card race.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steven Wine"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/nationals_marlins_baseball_21555_c0-136-3255-2033_s1770x1032.jpg?069357ee1235f7f5a3c0e03cda41a4df9de9685e", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
