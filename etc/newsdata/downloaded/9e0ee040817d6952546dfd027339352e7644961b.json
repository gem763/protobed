It seems everyone outside of the die-hard pro-gun factions is entertaining the idea of gun control. After all, we\u2019re told, we\u2019re in the midst of an epidemic of violence. Guns are killing people wholesale. Presidential candidates are claiming that guns kill more people than anything else. Worse, though, people buy it.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen how violent crime is actually down for 2018. Yet people think it\u2019s worse.\n\nHowever, I can see how that happens. Crimes that were common simply couldn\u2019t be reported on because it\u2019s impossible to cover all of them. When they become less common, it\u2019s possible to report on them and the perception becomes that the problem is worse rather than better.\n\nI\u2019ve argued that\u2019s part of what happens, but I\u2019m not going to let the media off the hook. Why? Because they\u2019ve gone out of their way to fail to inform the public on the reality of not just crime but also gun-related fatalities.\n\nMass shootings may grab the headlines, but suicides are by far the leading category of gun death in America. However, most Americans don\u2019t know this, according to a new national poll from APM Research Lab, Call To Mind and Guns & America. Experts say this misperception is handcuffing suicide prevention efforts. The poll asked more than 1,000 Americans what they think the leading cause of gun deaths is. Thirty-three percent of respondents chose homicides outside of mass shootings, while 25% thought that mass shootings caused the most gun deaths. Only 23% correctly identified suicides as the leading cause. The remaining respondents chose accidental shootings or said they didn\u2019t know.\n\nIn other words, the media has spent so much time and effort prattling on about mass shootings and pushing those as the major problem, people have a skewed perspective on whether or not they\u2019re a real problem. A third of the population apparently believes that most people shot and killed are murdered in mass shootings.\n\nMeanwhile, only a small handful are, as the report goes on to note:\n\nIn reality, fully 60% of gun deaths in the U.S. every year are suicides. Horrific as they are, mass shootings represent a tiny fraction of gun deaths in America. They account for a few hundred deaths every year, as compared to an average of roughly 19,000 gun suicide deaths. There were 23,854 suicides by firearm in 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And even with a murder rate well above other developed nations, gun homicides, which account for roughly 12,000 deaths per year in the U.S, are a distant second compared to suicides.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this is that suicide is far more preventable. It\u2019s a mental health issue that needs to be addressed from that angle. Trying to interfere with gun rights because someone might commit suicide is stupid, in part because it\u2019s not the only way to commit suicide but also in part because it completely ignores the suffering a suicidal person is going through. It focuses on the tool and not the human being that is dealing with internal torment.\n\nYet the media has remained focused on things like mass shootings and murders and has willfully ignored the reality of most so-called \u201cgun deaths\u201d being people taking their own lives. They love to cite the total number of \u201cgun deaths\u201d without bothering to break them down into their component parts such as homicides and suicides. While it would be easy to chalk this up to laziness, the truth is that they\u2019ve had this pointed out to them enough times to know better.\n\nNo, I have to conclude this is willful.\n\nBecause of that, the American public is woefully misinformed about just how most people shot and killed end up that way. While I tend to believe that you should never chalk up to maliciousness that which can easily be explained by incompetence, I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case this time around.\n\nMainstream media?
