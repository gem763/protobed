It's going to go pear-shaped.\"\n\n\"This is a joke,\" exclaimed Susanna, while Mr Broccoli claimed \"levity and humour\" were important.\n\nWhen Piers asked whether he had a TV, he answered: \"I'm just a broccoli, Piers. I don't have electronics.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nIn another odd moment, Mr Broccoli then got a banana out of his pocket and pretended it was a mobile phone.\n\n\"Sorry I've just got a call,\" joked the protester, much to the annoyance of Piers and Susanna.\n\nSusanna said: \"When you use the fruit and vegetable comedy comments, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re helping your cause at all.\"\n\nOnce the interview had finished, Susanna said: \"I\u2019m really cross. They had a fantastic opportunity to come on the programme and promote their cause and they ruined it. Which is why I think they\u2019re a plant from the meat industry,\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nGood Morning Britain viewers took to Twitter after watching the bizarre interview.\n\nOne viewer said: \"Woke up thinking I'm still drunk as they're interviewing a broccoli on the show\"\n\n\"Is this geezer dressed as a broccoli talking to a banana, wtf,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"What the hell is with this broccoli clown. Ridiculous\"\n\n\"I\u2019m done, #GMB interviewing an idiot dressed as a giant Broccoli, switched over to a everybody loves Raymond episode that I\u2019ve seen 6 TIMES,\" said a fourth.\n\n*Good Morning Britain airs weekdays on ITV at 6am", "description": "The GMB host was convinced Mr Broccoli was a 'joke' and admitted she was 'really cross' after the bizarre interview", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20589545.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RLP_MDG_18598JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
