The most common explanation comes from the fact that clothing, for wealthy men, often included weaponry. Since most men held swords in their right hands, this Quora thread explains, \u201cit was more convenient and quicker to use their left hand for unbuttoning.\u201d You can see evidence of that in portraiture. All those hand-in-waistcoat pictures popular in the 19th century? They involve, generally, the slipping of hand into an open area of the coat, right-to-left.\n\nYou could also see the right-button orientation as a holdover from warfare more directly. \u201cTo insure that an enemy's lance point would not slip between the plates,\u201d curators write in The Art of Chivalry: European Arms and Armor from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, \u201cthey overlapped from left to right, since it was standard fighting practice that the left side, protected by the shield, was turned toward the enemy. Thus, men's jackets button left to right even to the present day.\u201d\n\nYou can extend the theory even further back (as in, waaaaaay further back). As Katherine Lester puts it in Accessories of Dress, \u201ca man's role as hunter required that he pull a weapon from left to right. Fastening a garment from right to left would impede the movement of our ancestors.\u201d Or, as the menswear-loving comedian Paula Poundstone noted, jokingly taking on the button differential in Salon: \u201cSome costumers speculate that at one time, both men and women held animal skins over themselves with their left hand, making a right-over-left closure, in order to free up their right hand for more important tasks, such as signing their Discover card receipt at the belt store.\u201d\n\nOkay. So that (mostly) explains why men\u2019s buttons are on the right. But then, why are women\u2019s on the left?\n\nOne theory: babies. Given right-hand dominance, women tend to hold their infants in their left arms, keeping their right arms relatively free. So shirts whose open flap is on the right, one theory goes, makes it easier for them to open with those free hands for breastfeeding.\n\nAnother theory: horses. Women, to the extent women rode horses, rode sidesaddle, to the right\u2014so putting their shirt and dress buttons on the left reduced, to some extent, the breeze that would flow into their shirts as they were trotting along.\n\nAnother theory: spite. The early days of industrialization\u2014the time when clothing manufacturing practices were becoming standardized, and coming to set some precedents for today\u2014coincided with the early days of the women\u2019s movement. One theory holds that manufacturers took advantage of little differences in clothing to emphasize bigger differences between the genders. The left-right button differential wasn\u2019t, in that sense, so much a matter of practicality as it was one of philosophy. (For a corollary to that, we can thank, again, Napoleon. That hand-in-waistcoat pose? Women, apparently, used to mock the emperor by mimicking that pose. One theory (which, warning, I can\u2019t find much corroboration for, but I put out there for your consideration) holds that Napoleon ordered women's shirts be buttoned on the opposite side of men\u2019s to end all the fun-making at his expense.", "description": "On shirts, they're on the left for the ladies and on the right for the gents.
