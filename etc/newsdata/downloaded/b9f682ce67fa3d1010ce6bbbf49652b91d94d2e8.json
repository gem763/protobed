Ambassador Rodman\u201d:\n\n@NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, I know a thing or two about diplomacy between other countries.

Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d the now-deleted tweet read.\n\nAs a result, the Chinese Basketball Association suspended its relationship with the Houston Rockets.\n\nWhile Morey followed up with a pair of apologetic tweets, the NBA ultimately sided with the Chinese government:\n\nWe recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable. While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals\u2019 educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them. We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together\n\nRockets Owner Tilman Fertitta also pushed back on Morey\u2019s initial remarks.\n\n\u201cListen\u2026.@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets,\u201d Fertitta wrote. \u201cOur presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization\u201d:\n\nListen\u2026.@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization. @espn https://t.co/yNyQFtwTTi \u2014 Tilman Fertitta (@TilmanJFertitta) October 5, 2019\n\nESPN followed suit, tap dancing around the issue in order to refrain from further escalating the tension between the two entities.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nAccording to a report from Deadspin, ESPN\u2019s Senior News Director Chuck Salituro sent a memo to all staffers telling them to avoid talking about the political situation between Hong Kong and mainland China. Deadspin was also told that senior ESPN executives were monitoring all shows as they discussed the news of the day. ESPN\u2019s reticence to talk about the massive and endemic human rights violations stands in stark contrast to the network\u2019s all-out support for the NBA\u2019s boycott of North Carolina because of the Tar Heel State\u2019s transgender bathroom law.\n\nIt is not yet clear if Silver will respond to Rodman\u2019s request, but it is true that the former reality TV and NBA star has positioned himself as a diplomat in recent years. The White House reportedly thanked Rodman over the summer, specifically \u201cfor his role in advocating for diplomacy between North Korea and the U.S.\u201d", "description": "Former NBA star Dennis Rodman suggested he could play a role in alleviating the festering tension between the NBA and China.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/gty-rich-fury-640x480-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
