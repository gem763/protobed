Gareth Southgate\u2019s men have three more opportunities to get the job done and could do so as early as Monday with victory in Bulgaria if Kosovo also fail to beat Montenegro.\n\nHowever, much more than mere qualification is expected of Southgate and a talented young crop of players, who have raised hopes they can end England\u2019s long wait to win a major tournament by reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup and Nations League over the past two years.\n\nBoth those semi-finals ended in defeat to Croatia and the Netherlands in similar circumstances and, worryingly for Southgate, England made the same mistakes against far more meagre opposition in a Czech team ranked 44th in the world.\n\nIn all three matches England took an early lead, but slowly lost control of the game in midfield before defensive failings resulted in 2-1 defeats.\n\nEven a hitherto perfect start to qualifying as England scored 19 goals in winning their first four games in Group A has masked defensive problems.\n\nKosovo became the first side to score three times away in England in a qualifier for 12 years last month as the hosts edged an eight-goal thriller 5-3.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear we\u2019ve got to improve without the ball,\u201d admitted Southgate.\n\nYet, the solution is not a simple one.\n\nEngland appear to have much more strength in depth than when reaching the last four of the World Cup 15 months ago.\n\nBut there is an imbalance in the abundance of attacking talent available to Southgate and a paucity of defensive options.\n\nDanny Rose, Michael Keane and Harry Maguire were named in the back four despite poor starts to the season at club level with Tottenham, Everton and Manchester United respectively.\n\n\u201cThere are players who are not playing well for their clubs, but that is the situation we are in at the moment, certainly in a couple of positions,\u201d admitted Southgate.\n\nInjury to John Stones and Joe Gomez falling down the pecking order at Liverpool has dried up options at centre-back.\n\nBut Southgate\u2019s decision not to start Leicester\u2019s Ben Chilwell and an in-form Champions League winner in Liverpool\u2019s Trent Alexander-Arnold in the full-back positions was baffling.\n\n\u201cI always have to accept responsibility,\u201d added Southgate.\n\n\u201cWe tried something to make ourselves more solid without the ball. That didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nChilwell and Alexander-Arnold are expected to return in Bulgaria, but Southgate must also find the right balance in midfield.\n\nThe introduction of Mason Mount into an advanced midfield role left Jordan Henderson and Declan Rice outnumbered and overrun behind the Chelsea playmaker.\n\nSaturday\u2019s back pages of the English newspapers were littered with the same headline: \u201cReality Czech\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt came as a jolt to see them perform quite so badly,\u201d said The Times on England\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cThree years into the job, he (Southgate) has to deal with expectations that England can, and should, be much better than this.\u201d\n\nSouthgate\u2019s good work has raised expectations, now he has to find the solutions to deliver on them.", "description": "Prague (AFP) \u2013 England suffered a first qualifying defeat in ten years as the Czech Republic served them a timely reminder of improvements the Three", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/f09643_england-lost-qualifying-time-in-10-years-czech-republic-on-friday-imbalanced-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
