The crowded field is at 19 candidates as of Friday, with 12 of them having qualified for an Oct. 15 debate.\n\nWhen it comes to becoming the eventual vice presidential nominee, the Democratic contenders probably shouldn\u2019t get optimistic. It\u2019s rare for a major party\u2019s presidential nominee to choose a primary opponent as a running mate.\n\nIn the past 40 years, such a move has only happened three times. Ronald Reagan picked George H.W. Bush in 1980, John Kerry tapped John Edwards in 2004, and Barack Obama selected Joe Biden in 2008. Going farther back, other notable instances of a presidential nominee picking a primary foe as his running mate include John F. Kennedy selecting Lyndon B. Johnson in 1960, as well as Franklin Delano Roosevelt tapping John Nance Garner in 1932.\n\n\u201cThe eventual nominee is not disposed to choose a rival who has spent the last months criticizing him or her,\u201d said Joel Goldstein, a Saint Louis University law professor who has written two books on the vice presidency, in an email to MarketWatch. \u201cIt\u2019s not just personal tension; at times it would be too embarrassing to have on the same ticket two candidates who\u2019ve been so critical of each other.\u201d\n\nIn the three instances in the last four decades when a presidential nominee selected a primary opponent for his VP, he had to get over what had been said during the primary campaign. Bush had famously blasted Reagan\u2019s \u201cvoodoo economic policies,\u201d Edwards had criticized Kerry as a Washington insider who had backed bad trade deals, and Biden had drawn flak for describing Obama as the \u201cfirst mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.\u201d\n\nBecoming the vice presidential nominee is the \u201cnot-so-hidden hope of many of those remaining on stage,\u201d Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, told MarketWatch in an email. \u201cThey\u2019ll never admit it publicly, since it would be the kiss of death for their presidential chances, however slim. We all understand the idea \u2014 stay alive for as long as possible, get better known by the day, so that you have voters you can potentially add to the presidential nominee\u2019s appeal.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, this strategy can backfire,\u201d Sabato added. \u201cGiven Kamala Harris\u2019s fall to low single digits, I wonder if she\u2019d rethink her attack on Biden if she had to do it over. Biden-Harris would have been one obvious ticket. Could still happen, but surely less likely as a result of the bad blood engendered.\u201d\n\nSee: Harris attacks Biden on busing at June debate\n\nIn a RealClearPolitics average of polls as of Friday, Harris, the junior senator from California, has the support of 4.8% of those polled, behind current Democratic presidential front-runner Biden at 26.2%, as well as Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 24%, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 16.8% and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., at 5.5%.\n\nBeyond angling to become veep, some 2020 Democrats are aiming to build a donor network for future races, including for president or Senate, said Larry Jacobs, director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for the Study of Politics and Governance. They\u2019re also trying to position themselves for a cabinet job, congressional leadership or a judicial nomination, as well as aim for talk-show appearances and book contracts, according to Jacobs.\n\n\u201cCandidates stay in because benefits outweigh costs,\u201d he said. Jacobs noted that campaigning can involve comfortable digs. \u201cNo one is sleeping in a Super 8,\u201d he said, referring to the budget hotel chain owned by Wyndham Hotels and Resorts Inc. WH, -0.87% .\n\nButtigieg, in particular, probably has future races in mind, said the University of Virginia\u2019s Sabato.\n\n\u201cHe could run in the next 10 presidential elections,\u201d Sabato said of the 37-year-old mayor, who is often talked about as a potential candidate for Indiana governor, despite recent challenges in that state for Democrats. \u201cThe more events he does, money he raises, people he meets, and name ID points he gains, the better off he is in the future.\u201d\n\nSabato said most candidates don\u2019t drop out until they almost run out of money. \u201cTheir list of donors is still golden, though. They can rent that out for years to come,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Sanders leads in Q3 fundraising, followed by Warren, Buttigieg", "description": "It\u2019s rare for a major party\u2019s presidential nominee to choose a primary opponent as a running mate.
