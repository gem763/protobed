The offices of the financial services giant dominated four floors of One World Trade Centre, and James Deblase was among 658 of the company\u2019s employees who lost their lives.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The following month, he spoke at the United Nations General Assembly, pitching himself as someone ready to take on terrorism. \u201cWe\u2019re right and they\u2019re wrong \u2013 it\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n\nEighteen years later, with a brief stop for a failed 2008 presidential run, Mr Giuliani is still here, still in front of the cameras and still insisting that he is right. This week, the 75-year-old was named in the whistleblower complaint from a CIA officer who wanted to raise a red flag over Donald Trump\u2019s 25 July conversation with the president of Ukraine.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

For doing so, critics of the president allege he made clear, the US would lift a freeze on military aid for Kiev.\n\n\u201cIn the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple US government officials that the president of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election,\u201d the whistleblower wrote. \u201cThis interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the president\u2019s main domestic political rivals. The president\u2019s personal lawyer, Mr Rudolph Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort. Attorney general (William) Barr appears to be involved as well.\u201d\n\nThe accusations levelled in the complaint are the centre of formal impeachment proceedings announced this week by House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who displayed a new-found willingness to pursue such a censure. \u201cThe president must be held accountable,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d\n\nMr Trump has dismissed the complaint and its allegations as the latest effort by critics to oust him from office. This week, he appeared with Mr Zelensky at an awkward photo opportunity on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly where he insisted he had not pressured his counterpart.\n\n\u201cIf that perfect phone call with the president of Ukraine isn\u2019t considered appropriate, then no future president can EVER again speak to another foreign leader,\u201d Mr Trump tweeted.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

They have also drawn attention to what appears to have been an effort dating back at least 12 months, in which Mr Giuliani sought to persuade Mr Zelensky and his aides to investigate Mr Biden, over his alleged interference in pushing for the firing of an allegedly corrupt prosecutor who was said to have been probing an an energy company, Burisma, that employed the former vice president\u2019s son.\n\nEven before the complaint was made public, Mr Giuliani was known to be lobbying on behalf of Mr Trump. This summer, The New York Times reported that he held a face-to-face meeting in Madrid, in addition to a series of phone calls, with representatives of the incoming president, and that his efforts to influence domestic decisions in Ukraine included threats about the future of US military aid to the country.\n\nMr Giuliani has since been on a tour of television studios and on the phone to reporters, to defend his actions and those of the president. \u201cI\u2019m the real whistleblower,\u201d he told Politico.\u201cIf I get killed now, you won\u2019t get the rest of the story.\u201d\n\nIn a particularly colourful interview with The Atlantic, he claimed that he \u2013 not the whistleblower \u2013 should be considered a hero. \u201cThese morons \u2013 when this is over, I will be the hero,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not acting as a lawyer. I\u2019m acting as someone who has devoted most of his life to straightening out government. Anything I did should be praised.\u201d\n\nOn Fox News he said he had been acting on behalf of the US state department and said that Kurt Volker, the US\u2019s special representative to Ukraine, needed to speak out. \u201cHe should step forward and explain what he did,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t operating on my own.\u201d\n\nCommentators point out the obsession with Ukraine by Mr Giuliani and Mr Trump, echoes some of that voiced by conspiracy theorist conservatives, who allege the Democratic National Committee, whose server was allegedly hacked by Russia in 2016, was actually kept in Kiev. California-based CrowdStrike was hired in 2016 by the DNC to investigate the origins of the hack. Mr Trump even told the Associated Press he was surprised the FBI had not investigated the whereabouts of the servers given CrowdStrike was owned by \u201ca very rich Ukrainian\u201d.\n\nThe US media has pointed out this week, CrowdStrike was established by Dmitri Alperovitch, a Russian-born American citizen.\n\nAccording to the whistleblower complaint, one of Mr Trump\u2019s requests to Mr Zelensky was \"to assist in purportedly uncovering that allegation of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election originated in Ukraine, with a specific request that the Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and examined by the US cyber security firm CrowdStrike\u201d.\n\nIt added: \u201cThe president named explicitly as his personal envoys on these matters, Mr Giuliani and attorney general Barr, to whom the president referred multiple times in tandem.\u201d\n\nMr Giuliani did not respond to enquiries on Friday. His New York-based law firm did not reply to written questions.\n\nChristina Greer, professor of political science at Fordham University in New York, told The Independent she rejected any narrative that painted Mr Giuliani as a hero who had gone off the rails. She said his political career in New York had been based on race-baiting and discrimination. She said he once organised a riot involving off-duty white police officers to threaten David Dinkins, the city\u2019s first African American mayor, who in 1989 had defeated Mr Giuliani.\n\nShe said he and Mr Trump shared the same beliefs and had known each other for many years in New York.\n\n\u201cTrump trusts him. He has no friends, but he trusts Giuliani because they see themselves as white, ethnic outsiders against the world,\u201d she said.\n\nRobert McCaw, director of government affairs at the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said Mr Giuliani had long been willing to do the president\u2019s bidding on controversial issues, even as he was looked over for jobs such as secretary of state and attorney general.\n\nIn 2017, he helped put together the executive order that became the administration\u2019s first Muslim ban.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the whole history of it,\u201d he told Fox News, two years ago. \u201cWhen he first announced it, he said \u2018Muslim ban\u2019. He called me up, he said, \u2018Put a commission together, show me the right way to do it legally\u2019.\u201d\n\nSome believe Mr Giuliani\u2019s willingness to defend the president at each and every opportunity, and try to turn the focus onto Mr Biden and his son, is something Mr Trump will use to push his re-election chances.\n\nMike Fraioli, a Democratic strategist based in Washington DC, said it appeared the former prosecutor once known for bringing down mobsters, did not care about how he was viewed by Mr Trump\u2019s critics when he appeared on television.\n\n\u201cRudy does everything Trump asks of him. He goes on television and makes a fool of himself,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if he makes a fool of himself. They just keep trying to muddy the water.\u201d", "description": "There is a celebrated photograph taken the day after the 9/11 attacks, of Rudolph Giuliani at his very best.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/27/16/rudy-911.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
