We want to enable purchasers who hold a large portion of their wealth in digital currencies to deploy their capital, and we are very comfortable with the asset class.\u201d\n\nWynn Vice President Randy Hart explained the appeal. \u201cThere is something magical about the digital asset community. Digital currencies can be used to pay for an increasing amount of \u2018real world\u2019 things. This project is one step toward efforts to push Bitcoin and other digital currencies into the mainstream.\u201d As with standard fiat transactions, Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer screenings are part of the procedures in place to determine the source of funds that are paying for a property.\n\nAbout The Bahamas - Permanent Residency and Tax-Free Benefits:\n\nThe Bahamas also offers an ideal domicile for the management of personal wealth. Accelerated consideration for Permanent Residency is given to major investors and owners of upscale Bahamian property valued above $750,000.00 such as those offered within Goldwynn. Experienced consultants are available to ensure the best representation and fast-tracked approval of a purchaser\u2019s application.\n\nThe Bahamas is well respected in the international financial community for having a secure investment environment based on long standing parliamentary democracy, rule of constitutional and English common laws where regard for real property rights is guaranteed. As one of the world\u2019s premiere international financial centres, it also boasts a robust and well regulated financial services industry with a cadre of highly qualified professionals.\n\nThere are not many jurisdictions that offer the tax benefits comparable to those of The Bahamas. There are only a few things on which you pay taxes in The Bahamas. Capital gains, corporate earnings, personal income, inheritance and dividends are all tax-free. This applies not only to individuals, but also to all resident corporations, partnerships, and trusts. Tax advantages do not require that Bahamian residents remain in The Bahamas for any specific length of time in a given year, making it one of the most attractive residency jurisdictions.\n\nGOLDWYNN Hotel Lobby\n\nAbout The Residences at Goldwynn:\n\nCurrently under-construction, Goldwynn, is a six-storey 160 unit boutique condo-hotel suites and private residences located just along the shoreline from Rosewood Resort and Baha Mar in the heart of Cable Beach. With clean lines, extensive use of glass, large balconies and amenities that include several infinity pools, fitness centre, restaurant, theatre, art-deco bar, security, garage parking and concierge services, it is the latest in a series of residential developments by Wynn Development and the first in which the developer is delving into the digital asset space.\n\nContact:\n\nMatthew Marco\n\n[email protected]\n\n1-242-376-6696\n\nOr\n\n1-305-951-9322", "description": "Disclaimer: The text below is a press release that was not written by Cryptonews.com.\r \r __________\r \r \r A Beachfront Development in Nassau is now the first to accept and embrace digital currencies for real estate purchasers\r \r The Residences at Goldwynn, a sophisticated luxury beachfront condominium and resort development at Cable Beach in The Bahamas, has announced that they are now", "authors": ["Press Release"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5d9/d176290454.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
