The ship\u2019s bow was spotted in about 260 feet of water in June 2018 and its stern the following month. The last pieces of the wreck were found in May 2019, according to diver Ryan King of Brentwood, N.H.\n\nThe sinking of the USS Eagle PE-56 on April 23, 1945, was originally blamed on a boiler explosion. But the Navy determined in 2001 that it had been sunk by a German submarine, the U-853.\n\nLAST US WARSHIP SUNK BY GERMAN SUB DURING WWII DISCOVERED OFF MAINE\n\nKing and his dive team were able to confirm that an object previously discovered on sonar by undersea search specialist Garry Kozak was indeed the sunken ship. The divers, who worked with the Smithsonian Channel, extensively explored the ship on the ocean floor, five miles off Cape Elizabeth, Maine.\n\nOnly 13 of the Eagle\u2019s 62 crew members survived; they were plucked from the water by a nearby Navy destroyer.\n\nKing told Fox News about his team\u2019s experiences exploring the ship.\n\n\u201cWhen the torpedo exploded, she snapped in half \u2013 only one man got out of the bow section, 12 men made it out of the stern section,\u201d he said.\n\nWRECK OF WWII AIRCRAFT CARRIER USS WASP DISCOVERED IN THE CORAL SEA\n\nThe exploration of the wreck will be featured in the three-part series \u201cThe Hunt for Eagle-56,\u201d which premieres on Smithsonian Channel Sept. 22 at 9 p.m. EST/PST.\n\nDuring his dives, King explained that he could clearly see the Eagle\u2019s deck machinery and its massive 16-foot deck gun on top of the forward crew quarters.\n\n\u201cIt really is a humbling experience when you\u2019re down there, you\u2019re not just on a shipwreck, you\u2019re on a gravesite,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t touched things, we have made a point of staying out of areas where there is evidence of human remains.\u201d\n\nThe Eagle\u2019s helm and its telegraph are clearly visible at the wreck site.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing all of this equipment that is part of the wreck,\u201d King said. \u201cThere are lockers that are partially opened, the chart table is still there, there were men sitting around that when the torpedo exploded.\u201d\n\nWRECK OF AUSTRALIAN WWII SHIP DISCOVERED 77 YEARS AFTER IT WAS TORPEDOED BY A JAPANESE SUB\n\n\u201cYou realize that many of the men that used that equipment are still entombed in the wreck,\u201d he added.\n\nOn the stern, divers also got a view of the ship\u2019s aft escape hatches, where the ladders had fallen away, as described by Eagle\u2019s survivors.\n\nThe dive team also saw crew members\u2019 boots strewn around both the bow and the stern sections on the seabed.\n\nMAJOR WWII SHIPWRECK DISCOVERED: JAPANESE BATTLESHIP SUNK BY US FOUND\n\nThe dive team has to be cautious when dealing with parts of the ship containing its ordnance. On their first dive the hook that they sent down caught on a rack of depth charges on the Eagle\u2019s stern.\n\n\u201cIt was exciting!\u201d King quipped. \u201cObviously, they hadn\u2019t gone anywhere for a few years, but we figured that we would live it there.\u201d\n\nDivers have also had to contend with poor visibility at the wreck site, which, on a good day, is just 10 feet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly dark, without our lights, you wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything,\u201d said King.\n\nKing told Fox News that the team has shared its information on the wreck with the U.S. Navy.\n\n\u201cOnce we had a clear picture to bring to the Navy, we brought it to them as quickly as we could,\u201d he said.\n\nIn May the Navy wrote to the researchers to tell them that the ship had been out under the protection of the Sunken Military Craft Act, King added.\n\nWRECK OF THE USS JUNEAU, FAMOUS FOR THE DEATHS OF THE 5 SULLIVAN BROTHERS, DISCOVERED IN PACIFIC\n\nThe researchers are now working to ensure that the families of Eagle crew members receive the Purple Hearts earned by their loved ones. \u201cMany of the Purple Hearts went out to families in 2004 and 2005,\u201d King told Fox News, adding that officials are still working to get medals to families.\n\nEarlier this year, for example, the sister of Seaman First Class James Cunningham received his posthumous Purple Heart in a ceremony in Millington, Tenn., Stars and Stripes reports.\n\n\u201cWe attended the ceremony \u2013 it was a great piece of closure for the family,\u201d said King.\n\nCunningham, he explained, wasn\u2019t even supposed to be on the ship when it was torpedoed by U-853.\n\n\u201cHe was supposed to be on leave \u2013 he switched because his friend needed to go home on leave to bury a loved one who passed,\u201d King said.\n\nSTERN OF US WW II DESTROYER DISCOVERED NEAR REMOTE ALASKAN ISLAND: SURVIVOR RECOUNTS HARROWING DAY\n\nThe diver explained that researchers are working with three families at the moment to help them get their Purple Hearts.\n\n\u201cWe have some deadlines, there are family members that are older,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Naval History and Heritage Command did not respond to a Fox News a request for comment on this story.\n\nResearch undertaken by Paul Lawton, a Massachusetts attorney, naval historian and diver, played a key role in confirming the Eagle\u2019s sinking by U-853.\n\n\u201cThat was a result of Paul\u2019s work and Bernard Cavalcante of the Naval History and Heritage Command,\u201d King said.\n\nMYSTERY SHIPWRECK DISCOVERED, MAY BE WW II FREIGHTER\n\nThe ship\u2019s sinking is also the subject of Stephen Puleo\u2019s 2005 book \u201cDue to Enemy Action: The True World War II Story of the USS Eagle 56.\u201d\n\nThe U-853 was later sunk off Block Island on May 6, 1945, by depth charges from USS Atherton and USS Moberly. All hands were lost in the sub\u2019s sinking, which occurred two days before V-E Day, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command.\n\nResearchers across the globe are working to locate sites of World War II wrecks. The wreck of an Australian freighter, for example, was recently discovered, as was the wreck of a U.S. B-24 bomber that plunged into the sea off Bermuda in February 1945.\n\nWRECK OF WWII SHIP DISCOVERED 74 YEARS AFTER IT DISAPPEARED DURING A RESCUE MISSION\n\nAnd earlier this year, the wreck of World War II aircraft carrier USS Wasp was found in the Coral Sea, and the RV Petrel discovered one of the first Japanese battleships to be sunk by U.S. forces during the war. Imperial Japanese Navy ship Hiei sank on Nov. 14, 1942, in the Solomon Islands.\n\nWasp was also spotted on the seabed by experts from the vessel RV Petrel, which is part of a research organization set up by the late billionaire Paul Allen.\n\nAllen, Microsoft's co-founder, died in October 2018 from complications of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. His research organization has discovered a host of historic military shipwrecks, such as the wrecks of the USS Helena, the USS Lexington and the USS Juneau.\n\nMYSTERIOUS SHIPWRECK SPOTTED, MAY BE MERCHANT SHIP SUNK BY U-BOAT DURING WW II\n\nThe group\u2019s biggest discovery, however, came in 2017, when Allen and his team found the long-lost wreck of the USS Indianapolis in the Philippine Sea.\n\nIn a separate project, the wreckage of U.S. B-24 bomber, for example, was found in Papua New Guinea. The plane\u2019s wreck was found in 2018, 74 years after it was shot down during a fierce battle with Japanese forces.\n\nLast summer, a team of scientists from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego and the University of Delaware located the missing stern of the destroyer USS Abner Read, which was torn off by a Japanese mine in the remote Aleutian Islands.\n\nMYSTERY SHIPWRECK DISCOVERED, MAY BE WW II FREIGHTER\n\nAlso last year, a decades-long mystery about the fate of a ship that disappeared during a World War II rescue mission was finally solved.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAn extremely rare World War II Spitfire fighter plane flown by a pilot who later took part in the \"Great Escape\" was also recovered from a remote Norwegian mountainside last year.\n\nFox News\u2019 Nicole Darrah and the Associated Press contributed to this article.\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers", "description": "The wreck of the last U.S. Navy warship sunk by a German submarine during World War II is revealing its secrets in remarkable images from the seabed.", "authors": ["James Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Eagle566.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
