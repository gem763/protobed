At what point did we start to think that the more people knew about our personal turmoils, the less it would hurt? It\u2019s difficult to pinpoint, but is undoubtedly a byproduct of the internet age, in which our relationship with \"real\" (read: offline) people has been sidelined and skewed in favour of distant cries out into the ether of social media.\n\nEnter \u2018sadfishing\u2019: a new term coined to describe the act of seeking sympathy online rather than confiding in people IRL. Sadfishing is, for many reasons, both a good and a bad thing. Sharing sad news or flagrantly honest insights into your mental health via your Instagram stories, tweets or Facebook posts has become increasingly more common. It\u2019s easy to see it as a mere method of attention seeking, transforming grief and melancholy into something more quantifiable to make you feel better about your problems. But it\u2019s nothing to scoff at.\n\nSadfishing, despite the negative connotations of its name, is in fact a modern coping mechanism. It's just one we don\u2019t yet know enough about. In fact, the term was only coined this year by Digital Awareness UK, a research company conducting a study into the mental health and wellbeing of schoolkids. Professional psychologists are now playing catch-up; many are wary of discussing it because it\u2019s such a new phenomenon, and so we have to ask those actually doing it -- predominantly internet-native Gen Zers -- to make real sense of it instead.\n\n22-year-old Amy knows she sadfishes. \u201cYou have a problem and it's festering in your head but you don't actually want to talk about it to someone,\u201d she tells i-D. \u201cYou can't keep [these thoughts] in your head but also, you want to get them out somewhere. So I take to my Twitter to vent, share things I wouldn't usually share -- intimate things too. All because, for some reason, it feels like the people on Twitter aren't actually real.\u201d What Amy points out is a prime example of how some of us recognise social media as an entity rather than the hundreds, maybe thousands of people that its comprise of; every one of them taking note of, or ignoring, how we\u2019re feeling.\n\nFor every skip-story-and-eye roll reaction, there\u2019s a DM slide in solidarity with you; maybe a \u201cyou okay?\u201d response from someone you\u2019ve met one or two times, or the kind of close friend you should have gone to directly in the first place. \u201cIt just feels like as soon as I've pressed send on the tweet, a whole weight feels lifted off my shoulders.\u201d Amy says. \u201cBut my mum will see my tweets and text me saying \u2018What's your tweet about?\u2019 and I'll just be like, \"\u2019Stop being nosey!\u2019. Why did I put something on there when I knew I wasn't going to be able to talk about it?\u201d\n\nAfter all, the most common misconception about sadfishing is that we all do it solely for attention, seeking a response from someone to make us feel better. In many ways, the act itself starts reaping its rewards as soon as you\u2019ve clicked send: getting something deeply personal off of your chest and out into the world instead. Some people find solace in the likes and comments that stream in soon after; others fear interaction altogether. \u201cI think it\u2019s usually for validation,\u201d Alia thinks. Alia was born in Malaysia but lives in London. Most of her vents are posted \u201creligiously\u201d to her close friends story.\n\n\u201cI scatter my words bit by bit with pointless selfies as a background,\u201d she says, particularly about returning to the capital after spending a few months away and struggling to recalibrate. Attention seeking and validation are starkly different: the former is something confident people crave; the latter is for those who feel a little more lost. \u201cI know people who are quiet in person but post a lot on social media,\u201d she says of those seeking validation. \u201cTheir confidence is filtered through that, and so the idea and reality of people watching your stories or reading your tweets and responding is a boost.\u201d\n\nThere are varying degrees of severity to sadfishing online, and while some people are content just getting their sadness out there and off their minds, there are others who need help and are actively seeking it for the right reasons. In a time when access to therapy and mental health services is increasingly more difficult (only one in four young people with psychological issues are seen by a professional in the UK), sometimes an Instagram feed is the only place a person will be heard. It\u2019s important to read between the lines with these things, and to take every claim seriously instead of being instantly dismissive.\n\nWe can\u2019t help but be cynical sometimes, though. Perhaps the most common understanding of sadfishing -- the one that gave it a name derived from the act of catfishing -- is that it's exploitative and deceptive. That those who do it aren\u2019t actually sad, but instead use their social media feeds and the negative parts of their lives -- most commonly the death of a relative or a pet -- to drum up attention. We already know that the double buzz of a notification has a positive effect on our serotonin levels. Isn\u2019t it a kind of self-prescribed therapy to actively seek that interaction out, and use it to make ourselves feel better for a short time?\n\nSo while it might be easy to assume there\u2019s a malice involved in sadfishing, perhaps it\u2019s more responsible to look at the bigger picture and the end results. Seeing the umpteenth photo of someone\u2019s dead dog on your Instagram feed might seem like overkill, but have you ever thought of the good you\u2019re doing by smashing that like button? After all, a like doesn\u2019t have to be considered meaningless. Is it impersonal? Maybe, but there\u2019s no denying that being there for someone is better than ghosting them when they\u2019re down. Look at it that way.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "Far from being just a way of seeking attention, venting on social media is a way of reaching out across the void and forging a support network.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d95ce8223d51f000a4f5eb0/lede/1570111621598-Sadfishing_Header.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
