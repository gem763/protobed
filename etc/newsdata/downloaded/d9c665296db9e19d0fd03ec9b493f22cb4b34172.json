annual coastline flooding by 2050: study", "language": "en", "text": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Coastal areas currently home to 300 million people will be vulnerable by 2050 to flooding made worse by climate change, no matter how aggressively humanity curbs carbon emissions, scientists said Tuesday.\n\nBy mid-century and beyond, however, choices made today will determine whether Earth\u2019s coastlines remain recognisable to future generations, they reported in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nDestructive storm surges fuelled by increasingly powerful cyclones and rising seas will hit Asia hardest, according to the study.\n\nMore than two-thirds of the populations at risk are in China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand.\n\nUsing a form of artificial intelligence known as neural networks, the new research corrects ground elevation data that has up to now vastly underestimated the extent to which coastal zones are subject to flooding during high tide or major storms.\n\n\u201cSea-level projections have not changed,\u201d co-author Ben Strauss, chief scientist and CEO of Climate Central, a US-based non-profit research group, told AFP.\n\n\u201cBut when we use our new elevation data, we find far more people living in vulnerable areas that we previously understood.\u201d\n\nWith the global population set to increase two billion by 2050 and another billion by 2100 \u2014 mostly in coastal megacities \u2014 even greater numbers of people will be forced to adapt or move out of harm\u2019s way.\n\nAlready today, there are more than 100 million people living below high tide levels, the study found.\n\nSome are protected by dikes and levees, most are not.\n\n\u2013 Rising tides, sinking cities \u2013\n\n\u201cClimate change has the potential to reshape cities, economies, coastlines and entire global regions within our lifetime,\u201d said lead author and Climate Central scientist Scott Kulp.\n\n\u201cAs the tideline rises higher than the ground people call home, nations will increasingly confront questions about whether, how much and how long coastal defences can protect them.\u201d\n\nSeveral factors conspire to threaten populations living within a few metres of sea level.\n\nOne is the expansion of water as it warms and, more recently, ice sheets atop Greenland and Antarctica that have shed more than 430 billion tonnes per year over the last decade.\n\nSince 2006, the waterline has gone up nearly four millimetres a year, a pace that could increase 100-fold going into the 22nd century if carbon emissions continue unabated, the UN Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) warned in a major report last month.\n\nIf global warming is capped below two degrees Celsius \u2014 the cornerstone goal of the Paris climate treaty \u2014 sea level is projected to rise about half-a-metre by 2100.\n\nAt current rates of carbon pollution however, the increase would be nearly twice as much.\n\nA second ingredient is tropical storms \u2014 typhoons, cyclones or hurricanes \u2014 amplified by a warming atmosphere.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a big rise in sea level to lead to catastrophic problems,\u201d said Bruce Glavovic, a professor at Massey University in New Zealand who was not involved in the study.\n\n\u201cSea level rise is not a slow onset problem \u2014 it\u2019s a crisis of extreme weather events.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Rooftops and trees \u2013\n\nMajor storms that until recently occurred once a century will, by 2050, happen on average once a year in many places, especially in the tropics, the IPCC report found.\n\nAnnual coastal flood damages are projected to increase 100 to 1,000-fold by 2100, it said.\n\nFinally, many of the one billion people living at less than nine metres above sea level today are in urban areas literally sinking under their own weight.\n\nResearchers studying the impact of rising seas on human settlements have long known that the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data provided freely by NASA has a fairly wide margin of error.\n\nBut about five years ago Kulp and Strauss realised that \u2014 compared to more accurate data for the US gathered by laser-based systems on aircraft \u2014 SRTM was systematically showing elevations to be higher than they actually were.\n\nA big part of the problem was that the NASA system mistook rooftops and trees for ground level.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that for most of the global coast we didn\u2019t know the height of the ground beneath our feet,\u201d said Strauss.\n\nThe researchers detailed these shortcomings and the merits of their new system, called CoastalDEM, in peer-reviewed journals before matching them to populations data in the new study.\n\nJean-Pascal van Ypersele, a professor of climatology at Belgium\u2019s Universite Catholique de Louvain and a former IPCC vice-chair, said the new method represented \u201cvery signficant progress\u201d in understanding the risks posed by rising seas.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Coastal areas currently home to 300 million people will be vulnerable by 2050 to flooding made worse by climate change, no matter how", "authors": [],
