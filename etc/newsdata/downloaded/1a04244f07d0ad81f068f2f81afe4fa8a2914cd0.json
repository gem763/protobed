Many countries feel putting them on trial at home could inspire fresh domestic jihadist attacks.\n\nFrance has handed some French IS fighters over to Iraq for imprisonment.\n\n\"Many of them came from Europe, but they should go back to Germany, France,\" Trump declared Wednesday.\n\n\"We said we don't want them either, but somebody has to watch over them,\" he told reporters. \"We did you a favor, take your people back.\"\n\nFionnuala Ni Aolain, a special rapporteur for the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, called for the establishment of a systematic process for repatriating them.\n\n\"Despite growing international calls to address the problem, Western countries have done little to address it,\" she wrote Tuesday on the Just Security website.\n\n\"An effective return process is the only meaningful way we are likely to hold individuals accountable for the serious and systematic crimes committed in Syria and Iraq.\"\n\nHina Shamsi of the American Civil Liberties Union said IS prisoners cannot be left indefinitely in US military hands, either. The US must quickly repatriate them to their home countries or to the United States to stand trial in the federal criminal justice system, she said.\n\n\"The military must abide by both domestic and international law, and not repeat the costly legal, moral, and strategic mistakes of abuse and unfair trials,\" she said.", "description": "US President Donald Trump's decision to take custody of dozens of high-value Islamic State militants from the under-siege Kurds avoided their possible...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/01/wire-19564782-1570752465-206_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
