He spent two years and four months at a federal prison in Minnesota before he was paroled in 1981.\n\n\u201cIt was a watershed moment,\u201d Mr. Allen told Closer in its newest issue. \u201cIt put me in a position of great humility, and I was able to make amends to friends and family and refocus my life on setting and achieving goals.\u201d\n\nIn 1984, Mr. Allen married Laura Deibel and they had a daughter five years later. The stand-up comedian then became a household name after playing TV dad Tim Taylor on the hit series \u201cHome Improvement\u201d from 1991-1999. In 1998, he entered rehab for alcohol abuse after being charged with a DUI.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the same guy I was the first time [I was married], when I was hiding and doing what people who drink too much do. I was not connecting,\u201d Mr. Allen told Closer. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been sober for almost 20 years. I\u2019m much more present.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 68 percent joyous, aiming for 70 percent,\u201d he joked. \u201cI\u2019m also extremely grateful for where I am today.\u201d\n\nMr. Allen and Ms. Deibel divorced in 2003, and three years later, he married Jane Hajduk. They now have an 8-year-old daughter, Elizabeth.\n\nHe joked that his daughters still don\u2019t find him very amusing.\n\n\u201cThe older one [28-year-old Katherine] will roll her eyes, and the younger one just stares at me \u2014 I think she\u2019s done with me,\u201d Mr. Allen. \u201cBut I still try to play jokes and make them laugh.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
