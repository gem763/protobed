Google disputes its dominance.\n\n\"Ad tech is a very crowded field, and Google competes with hundreds of companies, including household names like Adobe, Amazon, AT&T, Comcast, News Corp and Verizon,\" company spokesman Josh Zeitz said. \"Publishers and advertisers mix and match technology partners to meet their different needs, creating both competition and innovation.\"\n\nLater, in response to this story, Google reiterated in a blog post https://www.blog.google/technology/ads/ad-tech-industry-crowded-and-competitive that its services foster competition.\n\n\"Our tools and platforms make it easy for advertisers and publishers of all sizes to choose whom they want to work with in this open, interconnected ad system,\" Google Vice President Sissie Hsiao wrote.\n\nHere are five common concerns about Google raised by 10 ad industry executives, most speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\nSEARCH AND YOUTUBE\n\nAbout 80% of Google's ad revenue and most of its profits come from ads within Google search results, YouTube, Gmail and other internet services the company owns. Rivals say that Google controls these properties in a way that hinders advertising competition.\n\nFor instance, the only technology system for buying ads on YouTube, the world's largest video streaming website, is Google's ad buying tool. Services such as Facebook Inc maintain similar control, in part to limit too widely sharing users' data. But as YouTube increasingly dominates online video, rival tools for placing ads in video streams become less attractive to advertisers because they can only access smaller audiences.\n\n\"It's incredibly difficult to compete with the monopoly search and video sites,\" said Brian O'Kelley, founder and former CEO of ad tech company AppNexus, in an interview in June.\n\nACQUISITIONS\n\nThe remaining 20% of Google\u2019s ad revenue is from what is commonly referred to as its \u201cdisplay business.\u201d Google boosted this operation by acquiring seller tools such as DoubleClick for $3.1 billion in 2008 and AdMob for $750 million in 2010 and then buyer services including Invite Media for a reported $81 million in 2010.\n\nThe combination of deals gave Google unprecedented positioning in every facet of how ads end up on websites and smartphone apps around the world. Though U.S. regulators approved the deals, their worst-case predictions about Google being too powerful have come true, rivals say.\n\nTo poach big customers from Google, smaller firms say they would need the cash to diversify their businesses and develop a complete suite of services. But drawing investment has been challenging because of the looming threats of Google and increased data privacy regulation.\n\nBUNDLING\n\nGoogle's variety of ad tools enable it to bundle them in a way that rivals say they cannot afford to match. For instance, websites and app owners, together known as publishers, over the years have become reliant on Google's DoubleClick ad serving tool. Nearly free to use for publishers, it is the only system of its kind that can receive real-time bids from Google's ads marketplace, known in the industry as AdX.\n\nThe popular marketplace, which matches up ad buyers with publishers, is where Google collects high fees.\n\nRivals said when using the Google ad-buying tool, advertisers get some key consumer data for free, early access to some purchasing options and potentially additional benefits if transacting through AdX. Google's packages for buyers and sellers to boost use of AdX are viewed as anticompetitive by rivals.\n\n\"The ubiquity of Google\u2019s ad server provides virtually total control over which ads are shown and monetized for the majority of the Internet,\" said Romain Job, chief strategy officer at competitor Smart AdServer. \"This control of the ad server is strategically critical to Google.\"\n\nStory continues", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK, Sept 11 (Reuters) - U.S. authorities investigating Alphabet Inc's Google for anticompetitive behavior have recently begun probing the company's $116 billion-a-year advertising business.
