But the types of pumpkins best used in some contexts are not ideal for others.\n\nAfter carving jack-o\u2019-lanterns for Halloween, you may want to use the pumpkin guts you removed to make a delicious fall meal. But is this a good idea? We did some research and asked an expert to break it down.\n\nTim Kitchen via Getty Images While the pumpkins best suited for carving are technically edible, they're not the tastiest options for cooking.\n\nWhich Pumpkins Are Best For Carving?\n\n\u201cThere are several varieties of traditional jack-o\u2019-lantern pumpkins that are best suited for carving \u2015 Racer, Magic Wand and Zeus, to name a few,\u201d Travis Nordgren, a principal produce buyer for Whole Foods Market, told HuffPost. \u201cThese varieties are usually a very deep orange in color, symmetrical in shape and hold up well when carved.\u201d\n\nOther varieties often used for carving jack-o\u2019-lanterns include Hobbit, Gold Rush, Howden and Connecticut field pumpkins.\n\nNordgren noted that such pumpkins are typically not called out by variety in stores but rather referred to as large, medium or small carving pumpkins \u2015 so if they\u2019re labeled by size, that\u2019s a cue not to eat them. When choosing a carving pumpkin, it\u2019s best to pick one with a sturdy stem so that you can keep the lid intact and help illuminate your jack-o\u2019-lantern.\n\nBut can you cook and eat the flesh of these carving pumpkins? Technically yes, but you may not want to.\n\n\u201cCarving pumpkins tend to have thinner walls that are more stringy, grainy and woody in texture \u2015 which unfortunately doesn\u2019t taste very good,\u201d said Nordgren. \u201cThey are edible, but they would need a lot of help from other ingredients because of the texture, so proceed with lowered expectations if using for dishes.\u201d\n\nHe recommends always saving the seeds, however. You can toss them in olive oil with a seasoning like garlic salt or cumin and roast them in the oven for an easy seasonal snack.\n\nWhich Pumpkins Are Best For Cooking?\n\nWhen it comes to cooking pumpkin dishes, canned pumpkin is a delicious option, but if you want to start from scratch, there are options at the grocery store and farmers market.\n\n\u201cThe smaller \u2018sugar pie\u2019 pumpkins are most commonly used for cooking and eating. This variety has a thicker, more dense flesh than carving pumpkins as well as better texture and sugar content, providing a much better eating experience,\u201d Nordgren noted. These kinds of gourds are sometimes called sugar pumpkins, pie pumpkins or sweet pumpkins.\n\nJason Jones Travel Photography via Getty Images Sugar pie pumpkins for sale at a farm sale in a field in California.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the smaller pie pumpkins, the Long Island Cheese Pumpkin is known as one of the better-tasting varieties and is a great option for stuffing and roasting,\u201d he added.\n\nOther popular types of pumpkins for cooking include Baby Bear, Cinderella, Fairy Tale, Jarrahdale, Jack Be Little, Ghost Rider and Baby Pam. Some have noted that Autumn Gold pumpkins are good for cooking and carving. And, of course, many of these optimal ingredient pumpkins make great decorations as well.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know the name of the pumpkin variety you\u2019re buying, there are ways to determine if it would be better for cooking and eating rather than carving.\n\n\u201cSize is always a good rule of thumb. Smaller sugar pie pumpkins are much better for cooking and eating, while the larger varieties are best suited for carving,\u201d Nordgren said. Carving pumpkins also tend to have more shallow ribs throughout, which make them easier to cut into.\n\nIt\u2019s also useful to note that carving pumpkins are often displayed outside in front of grocery stores, while pie pumpkins may be located in the produce section with other common winter squash varieties like butternut and spaghetti.", "description": "The best pumpkins for carving jack-o'-lanterns around Halloween aren't ideal for cooking and eating.", "authors": ["Culture", "Amp", "Parenting Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db744682100001e38ad4283.jpeg?cache=HlVenEbAkr&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
