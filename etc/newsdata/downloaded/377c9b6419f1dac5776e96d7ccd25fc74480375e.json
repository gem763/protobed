She spent most of her 10-minute appearance fawning over President Donald Trump and feeling sorry for herself.\n\nSanders began by dismissing concerns over the soft September jobs numbers. \u201cLook, I think at the end of the day, there\u2019s no question that the president and his administration have turned the country around and put it on the right track,\u201d she said, arguing that \u201cwe are doing better under this president than we have in the previous eight years.\u201d Those assertions went unchallenged by the Fox hosts.\n\nWhen Doocy suggested that some believed \u201cwe needed a magic wand\u201d to turn manufacturing around in this country, Sanders chimed in with, \u201cWell, we found one in President Trump.\u201d Even when some time Trump critic Brian Kilmeade raised mild concerns over the trade war with China, Sanders said the president was doing everything right.\n\nLater, Doocy brought up the infamous incident when Sanders was asked to leave a restaurant in Virginia and wondered whether she is \u201cstill taking heat when you go out to eat\u201d now that she\u2019s left the White House.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d she answered with a laugh. \u201cIt usually depends on where I am in the country.\u201d Sanders said she has had no problems in her native Arkansas but it\u2019s \u201chit or miss\u201d in New York City. While she said she hasn\u2019t been asked to leave any restaurants recently, people do sometimes say \u201cnasty\u201d things to her.\n\n\u201cWhat I always find interesting is, 99 percent of the people that come over to say something negative and to attack you are women,\u201d Sanders added, saying she finds that \u201cvery startling\u201d from a \u201cgroup of people that claim to be the champions of women empowerment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m only the third woman and the first mom to ever be the White House press secretary,\u201d she continued, \u201cand yet women attack me relentlessly instead of being proud that we have more women doing those types of jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re out of the administration!\u201d Doocy replied incredulously.\n\n\u201cI am, but they still see me as someone who is a very pro-Trump supporter,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to change my position.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, Sanders offered a small preview of what readers can expect from her upcoming White House memoir. \u201cMy experience was extremely positive,\u201d she said, \u201cmy book will be positive.\u201d We all know how that approach worked out for her predecessor Sean Spicer.", "description": "In her debut as a Fox News contributor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders complained that American women should be more \u201cproud\u201d of what she achieved as Trump\u2019s mouthpiece.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1434,w_2549,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567786565/SHS_jfgl8e", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
