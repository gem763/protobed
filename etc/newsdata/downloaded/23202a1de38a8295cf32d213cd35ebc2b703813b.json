I\u2019m not allowed to say.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "Stephanie Murphy, a Democrat, represents Florida\u2019s 7th Congressional District in the House of Representatives.\n\nIn May, other members of Florida\u2019s congressional delegation and I were briefed for 90 minutes in the U.S. Capitol by officials from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security regarding Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. I sought the briefing after then-special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s report showed Russia had probed and even pierced election networks in Florida, among the most closely contested states in U.S. politics. Although our briefers supplied new details, much remained unknown. What I do know, I can\u2019t talk about. Why that\u2019s the case is itself a mystery.\n\nThe Mueller report noted that Moscow\u2019s meddling involved three lines of effort, and Florida was a target of each. First, a Russian entity conducted a social media campaign to sow discord and help then-candidate Donald Trump, including by organizing pro-Trump rallies in Florida. Second, a Russian intelligence agency \u2014 the GRU \u2014 hacked computer accounts connected to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. As part of this effort, it published Florida-related data stolen from House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm.\n\nFinally, Mueller reported, the GRU sought to infiltrate computer networks involved in the administration of elections, which could enable Russia to alter voter registration databases or perhaps vote tabulation systems. That would be tantamount to an act of war, with malware rather than missiles as the weapon of choice. While Russian cyber actors cast a wide net, Florida\u2019s county-based election supervisors were a focal point.\n\nThe fact that Florida\u2019s election infrastructure was specifically \u2014 and successfully \u2014 targeted wasn\u2019t made public until about three years after the fact, when a single sentence deep in the Mueller report revealed Russia had breached \u201cat least one\u201d county in the state. Along with my Republican colleague from Florida, Michael Waltz, I asked federal law enforcement officials to brief the state\u2019s congressional delegation. Waltz and I both have national security backgrounds, and we wanted to better understand this threat to our country and state.\n\nAt the briefing, we were astonished to discover that, in fact, two Florida counties had been penetrated. Although it appears the Russians were in a position to alter voter data in these counties, there is no evidence to indicate they did so. We were told the counties\u2019 names but were barred by our briefers from disclosing them to the public. A subsequent report by the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee, which refers to targeted states by number, has deepened the mystery. The heavily redacted discussion of \u201cState 2\u201d \u2014 which appears to be Florida \u2014 now suggests four counties might have been compromised. Waltz and I have requested another briefing to clarify. Presumably, we will again be prohibited from sharing what we learn with our constituents.\n\nIt\u2019s self-defeating to be given incomplete information and then be required to remain silent about the few facts we do know. If we can\u2019t form a clear picture of past election interference efforts, we won\u2019t learn how best to fend off future attacks.\n\nWhy have the details of this foreign attack on our democracy been shrouded in secrecy? For the most part, it\u2019s not the need to protect intelligence sources and methods. Rather, it\u2019s that federal law enforcement agencies view local election officials whose networks were targeted as victims entitled to confidentiality. I believe the victims are the voters, who deserve to know what happened and what their leaders are doing to prevent it from happening again. The half-release of information has one clear side effect; it reduces the public\u2019s faith in our system, which could depress voter turnout. That would please Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nRussia will likely use similar tactics in 2020 \u2014 to influence whom Americans vote for, to make it harder for registered voters to cast ballots and even to prevent an accurate vote count. While Russia assisted a Republican in 2016, it could aid a Democrat in the future. Moscow\u2019s loyalty is to itself, not any U.S. political party. To defend our democracy, U.S. officials must put America first, a point lost on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has declined to take up House-passed bills to secure our elections.\n\nI\u2019ve filed a bipartisan bill to require Congress, local officials and affected voters to be swiftly informed if an adversary infiltrates our election system and the federal government believes voter information could be affected. Three years is too long to wait. With 29 electoral college votes and a history of razor-thin election margins, Florida will be the linchpin of any foreign effort to sway next year\u2019s vote. To protect the Sunshine State, and our democracy, more sunshine is needed.", "description": "Federal law enforcement agencies\u2019 half-release of information reduces the public\u2019s faith in our electoral system.", "authors": ["Stephanie Murphy", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/URZ8ZYobz3AHblFLHtUIhbqOgtk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D6DSXLGOSAI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg"}
