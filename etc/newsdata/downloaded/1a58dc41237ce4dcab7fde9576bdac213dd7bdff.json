Around 127 military projects are expected to be put on hold, and construction for 175 miles of the wall could begin in over 100 days, according to CNN. Pentagon comptroller Elaine McCusker said the funds will be pay for 11 border crossing projects.\n\nSchumer's office noted the plan will \"delay critical construction projects\" for his state and constituents, notably the United States Military Academy in West Point. The military academy educates and trains roughly 4,500 cadets to become future officers in the US Army.\n\nThe academy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Trump administration planned on reallocating military construction funds to pay for the proposed wall. Trump declared a national emergency in February, allowing him to bypass congress and fund the controversial wall at the border. Congress attempted to block Trump's declaration but the resolution was vetoed by the president.\n\nTrump previously claimed over 200 times that Mexico would fund the wall, according to an estimate from The Washington Post. He later walked back his remarks and said in January that he \"never said this.\"\n\n\"I never meant they're going to write out a check,\" Trump said, referring to Mexico.", "description": "Democratic Sen.
