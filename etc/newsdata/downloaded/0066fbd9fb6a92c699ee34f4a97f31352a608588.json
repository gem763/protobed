CBD does not contain the compound that gets people high.\n\nThe vaping concerns have contributed to recent declines, and will continue to hurt shares, said Bruce Campbell, portfolio manager at Stonecastle Investment Management, which invests in cannabis stocks.\n\n\"It's a case of 'shoot first, ask questions later',\" he said. \"(Investors) probably do some quick back-of-the-envelope math and say, 'we're not going to see the sales we expected, so we're out'.\"\n\nAnalysts estimate that in some established U.S. markets, vape sales are down as much as 30%, with many marijuana consumers reverting to use of less profitable flower and oil products.\n\nWhile a shift away from Canada's illicit cannabis vape market into legal dried flower is positive from a public health standpoint, prolonged uncertainty could hurt legal vape sales.\n\n\"These illnesses ... occurred using non-regulated products,\" said Jason Zandberg, research analyst at investment dealer PI Financial.\n\nInvestigators have pointed to vaping products containing THC or vitamin E acetate, a thickening agent often mixed with THC oil in the illicit market, as possible causes of the rash of serious lung problems.\n\n\"In theory, it should promote the legal market,\" Zandberg said. \"But if you don't have very aggressive education behind these products, a good portion of the population doesn\u2019t see the difference.\"\n\nThe regulations that take effect on Oct. 17 take into account the emerging health risks associated with cannabis vaping. They prohibit additives including vitamins and coloring agents, Health Canada, which regulates cannabis producers, said in an email.\n\nThe health agency added that it is monitoring the situation, and will take additional action if needed.\n\n\"The Canadian government should come out as soon as possible one way or other and either double down on vape products or remove them from the derivatives market. You have to give the industry clarity,\" said Brett Hundley, a cannabis analyst at Seaport Global.\n\nIf the government suddenly removes vape products from the roster of expanded legal cannabis offerings, including edibles and extracts, \"that\u2019s going to reverberate back through the supply chain and it\u2019s going to lead to a whole host of near-term issues\" for these companies, Hundley said.\n\nCannabis companies are trusting that adhering to Health Canada's rules will provide reassurance for investors and consumers.\n\nA spokesman for Canopy Growth Corp, Canada's biggest cannabis producer, in an email, pointed to the importance of the regulatory frameworks for cannabis vape products that Canada has in place.\n\nHexo Corp, another Canadian company with a variety of cannabis products, said it is focused on ensuring it is compliant with Health Canada's regulations. Hexo is double testing its vape products, James McMillan, vice president of business development, said in a phone interview.", "description": "Vape product concerns weigh on Canadian cannabis companies looking for sales boost", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8S0I1_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
