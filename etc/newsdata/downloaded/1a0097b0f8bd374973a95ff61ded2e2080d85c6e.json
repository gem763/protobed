(AP) - Prosecutors allege that a former New Hampshire lawmaker who served jail time on charges of drug possession and trying to lure a 14-year-old girl over Facebook into a sexual encounter was back online after his release, trying to communicate with the girl\u2019s friend.\n\nKyle Tasker pleaded guilty in 2017 and spent about two years in jail. He was granted work release in March. The 34-year-old Nottingham Republican resigned in 2016.\n\nThe Concord Monitor reports a prosecutor\u2019s motion asks a judge to impose a six-month suspended sentence. It alleges that Tasker gained access to the internet in violation of his sentence conditions. They say he asked his mother to manage his Facebook account and sent a friend request to a girl who knew the victim.\n\nTasker\u2019s lawyer said he didn\u2019t go online. He asked for a hearing.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Concord Monitor, http://www.concordmonitor.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Prosecutors allege that a former New Hampshire lawmaker who served jail time on charges of drug possession and trying to lure a 14-year-old girl over Facebook into a sexual encounter was back online after his release, trying to communicate with the girl's friend.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
