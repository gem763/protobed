But it\u2019s also added capabilities like automated budgeting, automated saving and bill negotiation. And this fall, it plans to launch additional features, including bill pay, credit score monitoring and a rewards program.\n\nConsumers have plenty of other personal finance tools to choose from, but Mokhtarzada said most of them are focused on fulfilling a specific need and will likely become less relevant as your financial situation changes.\n\n\u201cThe other half is, if you look at the App Store, it\u2019s filled with single point solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cAs your financial life gets more sophisticated and complex, the consumer is ending up with five or more different point solutions. All of that needs to be consolidated into one place.\u201d\n\nTruebill says it currently has 500,000 active users. The basic product is free, then users can pay a price of their choosing for premium features like custom budget categories; Truebill also takes a cut of the savings when it negotiates lower bills.\n\nThe company recently opened new headquarters in Silver Spring, Md. Mokhtarzada said Truebill still has an office in San Francisco, but he noted that he and his co-founders/brothers previously built Webs.com in Silver Spring.\n\n\u201cSan Francisco obviously has a very competitive market \u2014 it\u2019s harder to hire and very difficult to retain talent,\u201d he added. \u201cWith the D.C. area, it feels like we\u2019ve found an untapped market, with very talented engineers working for the government, working in an area of technology that\u2019s not very exciting for them.\u201d", "description": "Personal finance startup\u00a0Truebill announced today that it has raised $15 million in Series B funding.
