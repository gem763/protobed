For their part, the Seminole tribe has no issue with the long-standing FSU tradition.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they take any offense to anything that\u2019s done at Florida State, by virtue of the positive relationship and the full scope of that relationship,\u201d said Gary Bitner, spokesman for the Seminole Tribe of Florida. \u201cThey really believe that you have to look at it as a total relationship, and it\u2019s not their business to get into what other entities do without fully understanding all of that.\u201d\n\nStill, given the resistance from tribes that once inhabited Georgia, and the fact that a single complaint from an MLB pitcher caused the Braves to stop the chop and chant during the playoffs, that does not bode well for the future of the \u201cTomahawk Chop.\u201d\n\nActivist groups have had some success removing Native American mascots in Major League Baseball. Most notably, the Cleveland Indians agreed to discontinue their use of the \u201cChief Wahoo\u201d logo.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "The Atlanta Braves organization will meet with representatives of various Native American groups, to discuss the future of the team's", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Getty-Images25-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
