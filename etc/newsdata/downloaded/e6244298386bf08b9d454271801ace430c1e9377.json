But analyst Richard Hyman warned conditions are set to worsen.\n\n'The retail industry is suffering from chronic oversupply,' he said. 'In the next five years there is going to be an enormous shake-out and some big retailers aren't going to be around any more. The trick for the others is to batten down the hatches and get through this period.'\n\nJohn Lewis Partnership is merging the management teams of John Lewis department store and grocery chain Waitrose to save \u00a3100million costs\n\nHe said the John Lewis chain, which last week demanded 20 per cent rent cuts from landlords, is 'much too big', as more and more purchases are being made online.\n\n'John Lewis and Waitrose are fantastic businesses with many strengths. But more needs to change and the new structure is going to need quite a bit of fine tuning,' he added.\n\nHyman said White, who arrives next year, may consider watering down the price guarantee \u2013 which exposes it to rabid discounting from struggling chains such as Debenhams \u2013 rather than ditching it altogether.\n\n'I'm cautiously optimistic for John Lewis \u2013 emphasising the caution because it's all about execution. But I think 'Never Knowingly Undersold' will be high on the list of things she needs to look at.'", "description": "The company is merging the management teams of John Lewis and Waitrose to save \u00a3100million costs.
