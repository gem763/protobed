I'm a Madridista. Full stop.\u201d\n\nThose positive memories would presumably have included the 100 point 2011\u201312 season when Madrid [temporarily] knocked Barcelona off their perch. But not the poke in the eye of Barca assistant coach Tito Vilanova, the shockingly bitter rows with local media, and falling out completely with many of his own players from Pedro Leon through Iker Casillas and Sergio Ramos to Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nMourinho used his latest flurry of media appearances to say that of course he \u201cdoes not want to feed\u201d any rumours about him being after Zidane\u2019s job. But also added that he was \u201cfriends with all my presidents, even those who fired me.\u201d\n\nJose Mourinho has stoked speculation over his return to the Bernabeu (Getty)\n\nWhile Madrid going top of the early La Liga table over recent days has helped secure Zidane\u2019s position for now, the word coming out of the Bernabeu is that the Frenchman\u2019s relationship with Perez has broken down. As the ex-galactico is furious at unfulfilled promises over transfers last summer, specifically Paul Pogba not arriving and Gareth Bale not leaving. The team having won just eight of 17 games since he returned last March also does not help his job security.\n\nAsked after last week\u2019s disaster in Paris whether he was annoyed about reports Mourinho was about to replace him, Zidane claimed to know he had his boss\u2019 backing \u201cuntil the last moment\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is like that here [at Madrid],\u201d the Frenchman said. \u201cWhen you lose a game, everything must be changed. That is difficult, but it is the reality. Until the last moment, the club [ie Perez] back everyone who works here. If it were not like that, it would be better to leave. I feel strong, I won\u2019t drop my hands, and I will keep doing my job.\u201d\n\nVery secure in his own ability, the former Ballon D\u2019Or winner also rarely feels the need to share his true feelings with either journalists or supporters. Neither does he generally go along with the media propaganda campaigns which Florentino views as an important part of being Madrid first team coach.\n\nMourinho - of course - had little trouble stirring up media storms as a means of pushing the club's agenda. It was pointed out on these pages recently that [https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/how-jose-mourinho-made-himself-wanted-again-man-utd-real-madrid-a9113066.html] he has always in public projected the image of a strong leader who can be trusted to restore order in times of disquiet or unruliness.\n\nZinedine Zidane, the Real Madrid manager, is under pressure (Reuters)\n\nThis sits very well with Perez\u2019s view of the world, and with what his team currently needs. Now one of his country\u2019s richest individuals due to his success as a construction magnate, his first career was in the civil service during the end of General Franco\u2019s regime. He only turned to business in the 1980s after failing to be elected to the Spanish parliament as the candidate of a conservative party, and remains close to many in today's right-wing Partido Popular. The 72 year old shares many of his fellow Iberian's ideas in the importance of loyalty, unity and obedience.\n\nThe bomb which the return of Mourinho would set off among many in the local media would be another plus for Florentino. During his first spell, Mourinho embraced the division of local journalists and pundits into \u2018madridistas\u2019 and \u2018anti-madridistas\u2019. This distinction was also introduced into the club\u2019s off-pitch structure, leading to the exits of distinguished servants Jorge Valdano and Miguel Pardeza. And even into the dressing room - most famously in the treatment of previous club hero Casillas.\n\nThis left few at the club who would question the leadership from the top, a situation which Perez enjoys. It also means that prominent ex-players and media pundits are currently being very careful when giving their views about Mourinho's potential return, knowing they would be in the firing line themselves if [or when] it does happen.\n\nBringing back Mourinho would also - in Perez\u2019s view - be useful to help finally clear out the current dressing room's remaining problematic egos. With Cristiano Ronaldo having been invited to leave for Juventus last year, the club president appeared very open this summer to Sergio Ramos leaving next. Zidane intervened at that point to persuade Ramos not to take a big payday in China. Given his history with the Andalusian, Mourinho would presumably not have made that effort.\n\nThose around key players in the team maintain that the squad remains firmly behind Zidane. Asked about the Mourinho rumours after the 1-0 victory at Sevilla on Tuesday night, club captain Ramos said: \u201cTalking about other coaches is a lack of respect for ours. We have shown that we are behind Zizou, despite previous results. We must be relaxed now.\u201d\n\nA test of Madrid's apparent recovery will come at the Wanda on Saturday, with Diego Simeone\u2019s new-look Atletico having impressed in parts through the opening weeks of 2019/20. New \u20ac100m galactico Eden Hazard and back in favour Bale look sure to start up front, while Zidane\u2019s toughest call is over whether to bring fit again veterans Marcelo and Luka Modric back into the XI.\n\nMadrid's performance in last season\u2019s fixture, winning 3-1 during Santi Solari\u2019s spell as coach while matching Atletico for aggression and physicality throughout, was their best of the entire campaign. Something similar will be needed again from Zidane's side, with a morale-boosting victory badly needed by everyone around the club.\n\nA repeat of the limp PSG performance, or the 7-3 pre-season defeat to Simeone's team, will bring more questioning of Zidane's future. And could well be followed by a certain ghost returning to frighten many at the Bernabeu.", "description": "A spectre is haunting the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu - the spectre of former Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho, with it now likely just a matter of time before he returns to his old job with the Spanish giants.While six La Liga points in four days has taken the pressure off current Blancos coach Zinedine", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lWebjWKiUyoSuLOWuYEoZw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwNTI7aD03OTA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7ORJlLKHxPi553OEoE.XNw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/146974c3d9491c1efdfe30f761dfe82a", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
