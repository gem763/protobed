AFP/Getty\n\nThere are a number of routes from the city centre to Brandywell. One goes through the Bogside. It runs past the site of Bloody Sunday and is overlooked by huge murals of Republican hunger strikers. In the middle of a dual carriageway the famous gable end of a terraced house stands alone with its message: \u2018You are now entering Free Derry.\u2019 Irish tricolours and Starry Plough flags flutter from the lampposts. Evidence of the Troubles is everywhere.\n\nAn alternative route goes along the city walls and passes the Fountain area, one of the last bastions of Loyalism on this side of the River Foyle. Here, the curbs are painted red, white and blue. A message painted on a wall is stark: \u2018West Bank Loyalists, Still under siege. No Surrender.\u2019 A \u2018peace wall,\u2019 higher than the historic battlements, runs up to the Bishop\u2019s Gate, separating the Protestant occupants of the Fountain from their Catholic neighbours. For many within the Unionist community, going to Nationalist Brandywell is unimaginable.\n\nInstitute\u2019s own ground, Riverside Stadium, is on the opposite bank of the Foyle. It was flooded and became unusable two years ago. This happened at a bad time. The team were on their way to winning promotion to the top flight. Various options were explored \u2013 including playing in Belfast, some 70 miles away. Instead they did what some had believed unthinkable. They became tenants at Derry\u2019s ground.\n\n\u201cThey were very well received by the nationalist residents and the different community groupings in the area,\u201d Scampton said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a happy cohabitation.\u201d\n\nBrandywell is no stranger to Irish League teams. Derry played in Northern Ireland\u2019s main division until 1972, when they were effectively forced out of the predominantly Protestant organisation. They spent 13 years attempting to be readmitted before looking south. In 1985 Fifa gave the club special dispensation to play against teams from the other side of the border. Derry have grown into one of the best sides in Ireland and Brandywell was revamped two years ago. It now has a 7,700 capacity and is a vital resource for some of the most neglected communities in the United Kingdom.\n\nTraditionally, the pitch was surrounded by a greyhound track. When the rebuilding took place, the club were keen that the stands should be closer to the pitch but knew dog racing was important to local people. Continuity was maintained by creating a new track around a training area adjacent to the stadium.\n\nLawrence Moore, the club\u2019s public relations officer, leans against a barrier as a mechanical hare zooms past followed by a galloping hound. \u201cThey\u2019re training the dogs,\u201d he said, before turning his attention to a different type of practise. A goal kick\u2019s distance away Derry\u2019s youth teams are going through their paces. Different age groups run drills on the pitch and Moore watches with pride.\n\n\u201cDerry\u2019s a football town,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Brandy is the biggest social gathering in the north west. It\u2019s so important to the local people. We\u2019re also working to extend our reach beyond our own community.\u201d\n\nThe club are committed to combatting sectarianism. Irish tricolours and nationalist emblems are banned from the stadium and the team colours are stridently neutral red and white. \u201cWe all have different identities and there\u2019s a time and place for that but it\u2019s not at the Brandy,\u201d Moore said.\n\nScampton agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple,\u201d he said. \u201cDerry City are a totally apolitical club. We have people from all traditions. We don\u2019t have issues about flags and partisan symbols.\u201d\n\nInstitute supporters understand the situation. The greater concern for Scampton is their rival Irish League teams. \u201cThere\u2019ll be around 200 Institute fans in the ground but about 350 Larne fans. They bring some stewards with them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA lot of Irish League clubs are from a Protestant background. They understand the position Institute are in and the political delicacies around Institute being here. We\u2019ve had no major incidents so far. The Irish League clubs are aware that actions of supporters would be highly detrimental to the game.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, tensions remain. At the annual Apprentice Boys parade last month, a Protestant marching band upset locals by wearing Parachute Regiment symbols on their uniforms. This was the unit that killed 14 civilians on Bloody Sunday in the Bogside. Solider F, one of the troopers involved in the shootings in 1972, is set to stand trial in the city charged with two murders and four attempted murders on that dreadful day. The band are based in Larne.\n\n\u201cBands sometimes attach themselves to football teams,\u201d Scampton said. \u201cWe have some concern about shows of support for Soldier F. It\u2019s been stressed to them and Irish League clubs try to make sure these individuals are not associated with the club.\u201d\n\nIn the unlikely event an incident does occur it will be dealt with quickly. Scampton and his team pride themselves on their light touch and welcoming approach. It is an ethos that runs throughout the club. Perhaps because of the history and location of the stadium, everyone connected with Derry makes a huge effort to ensure visitors feel at home. Except on the pitch.\n\nDundalk can expect a difficult night. The runaway League of Ireland Premier Division leaders are unbeaten in 27 games and have only drawn two during that run \u2013 both against Derry. \u201cThat\u2019s the level everybody in Ireland is shooting at,\u201d Moore said. \u201cOn a game-by-game basis we\u2019ve matched them.\u201d\n\nDerry won the League Cup last season but, when Declan Devine was appointed manager in November, it seemed unlikely the team would be challenging for honours this year. \u201cAt that point we only had four contracted players,\u201d Moore said. \u201cHe\u2019s put together a team that\u2019s on the verge of qualifying for Europe.\u201d\n\nBrandywell will be packed to the rafters. \u201cIt\u2019s the first complete sellout since 2003 when we played Barcelona in a friendly,\u201d Moore continued. \u201cIt\u2019ll be some atmosphere.\u201d\n\nDevine has brought a sense of purpose back to the club. \u201cWe had lost our way a little because we lost our local spine,\u201d Moore said. Good players were allowed to slip though the net. \u201cThe spine of the Dundalk team came through Derry\u2019s academy,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut it does give you an idea how strong football is in this area.\u201d\n\nThe club has suffered tragedy, too, in recent years. Ryan McBride \u2013 who the stadium is named after \u2013 died suddenly at the age of 27 two years ago. Mark Farren, the team\u2019s highest goalscorer in the League of Ireland era, lost a battle with cancer the previous year. He was 33.\n\n\u201cA football club is the beating heart of the city,\u201d Scampton said. \u201cTo have a good team makes people feel better on Monday morning. I use the Barcelona tagline: \u2018More than a club.\u2019 We\u2019ve had a lot of tragic years. Ryan grew up round the corner. He used to walk to the ground and then walk home again after the game. Mark had the main stand named after him. Everybody knows one another. The club is important to the people here.\u201d\n\nMoore concurs. \u201cOne thing that Declan did is to make sure the players know what it means to play for the club,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t take the support for granted. This is not a wealthy community. The players want to give supporters value for money.\u201d\n\nWin or lose, Derry are on the march. \u201cThe final has probably come too early for us,\u201d Devine said. \u201cWe\u2019re only 10 months into project. We\u2019re punching above our weight. We\u2019ve got momentum and we\u2019ll get better.\u201d\n\n\u201cSaturday won\u2019t define the season,\u201d Moore added. \u201cThe future is bright.\u201d\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s fate is more uncertain with Brexit exacerbating tensions but the cross-community efforts at Brandywell show that co-operation can work and bring both sides of the political gulf together.
