The newspaper reported that the part's service could not be determined \"with certainty\", and suggested that a criminal syndicate may be at play.\n\nThis was denied by SAA on Thursday.\n\n'Like a pothole'\n\nAccording to a statement by the SAA board, the flight in question experienced \"technical difficulties\" that had a \"limited impact\" on passengers. The statement described the incident as a \"minor jolt, akin to driving through a pothole\".\n\nThe flight was obliged to turn back and the incident was reported to SACAA.\n\nSAA confirmed that a stabiliser trim motor failed during the flight's climb to its planned cruise altitude. The motor helps with slight adjustments to keep the aircraft stabilised.\n\n\n\nBut the airline \"categorically\" denied that that it was a suspect part and that the SAAT \"did not and does not use fake parts when servicing aircraft belonging to Mango Airlines or any other airline it services\".\n\nAccording to SAA, the aircraft component that failed was legitimately procured from the original equipment manufacturer in August, and failed after 96 flights.\n\nSAAT is audited, inclusive of site inspections, by independent global organisations, the airline added.\n\n\n\n\"We wish to assure customers that all components and parts are procured from approved suppliers and all supporting documentation complies with South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) requirements on components,\" the statement added.\n\nIt further denied that there was any known crime syndicate that had infiltrated the airline's technical team.\n\n\"Whilst any acts of criminality cannot be ruled out, it is untrue that there is a known international crime syndicate that has infiltrated SAA or SAAT that is responsible for tender manipulation and/or corruption at SAA or SAAT.\n\n\"There is no link, direct or indirect, between the aircraft incident involving the Mango flight reported on and matters that are currently under investigation at SAAT.\"\n\nSAA previously told Fin24 it had reason to believe that \"an enterprise with transnational networks\" was at work in the organisation.", "description": "SAA has denied that the airline's maintenance division, SAA Technical, uses fake parts when servicing aircraft belonging to Mango Airlines or any other airline.", "authors": ["Marelise Van Der Merwe"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9446/ba84b7a2199542038b39a167b6260ad2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
