(AP) - Odell Beckham Jr. felt right at home again - in the end zone and on the highlight reels.\n\nWith an 89-yard touchdown catch and a spectacular one-handed grab in his return to MetLife Stadium, the Browns wide receiver helped lift Cleveland past the short-handed and banged-up New York Jets 23-3 on Monday night.\n\n\u201cWe got the ball in (No.) 13\u2019s hands,\u201d Browns wide receiver Jarvis Landry said, \u201cand let him go.\u201d\n\nBeckham, traded from the Giants in March, helped the Browns (1-1) bounce back from a 30-point loss to Tennessee in their opener to top the Jets (0-2) and give Freddie Kitchens his first win as Cleveland\u2019s coach.\n\nIt all came after Beckham called out Jets defensive coordinator Gregg Williams last Thursday, saying the coach - then with the Browns - instructed players to hurt him in a preseason game in 2017. Williams denied Beckham\u2019s accusations and jokingly asked reporters: \u201cOdell who?\u201d\n\nWilliams, who led the Browns to a 5-3 record as their interim coach last season, also chided reporters for giving Beckham attention and wouldn\u2019t call him one of the NFL\u2019s most dynamic players.\n\n\u201cEverything fuels me,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cGood comments, bad comments, I feel all of that. I just want to be the very best that I can and be the leader I am supposed to be.\u201d\n\nWell, Williams clearly knows who Beckham is now. The coach was seen shouting angrily on the sideline after Beckham\u2019s touchdown.\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d Beckham said when asked about Williams\u2019 comments. \u201cNo, everybody has the right to their own opinion. He\u2019s a phenomenal coach, he\u2019s got a great defense, but I\u2019m done talking about it, you know? We won, so I just tried to make plays to help the team.\u201d\n\nBeckham finished with six catches for 161 yards and the TD from Baker Mayfield, who couldn\u2019t believe Williams\u2019 comments.\n\n\u201cHe said that? Jesus,\u201d the Browns quarterback said, shaking his head. \u201cNext question. Not a dynamic football player? OK.\u201d\n\nNew York lost quarterback Trevor Siemian to an ankle injury in the second quarter, and Luke Falk - promoted from the practice squad earlier in the day - played the rest of the game. Siemian was starting in place of Sam Darnold, who\u2019s sidelined for at least a few weeks while recovering from mononucleosis.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been a weird week,\u201d Falk said. \u201cA week ago, I was on the practice squad and then tonight I\u2019m standing in front of you guys after playing in a game.\u201d\n\nThe Jets couldn\u2019t get anything going on offense, and the Browns blew open the game late in the third quarter.\n\nFalk led the Jets on their longest drive of night to that point - 60 yards - but Le\u2019Veon Bell could only get 1 yard on a fourth-and-2 pass, turning the ball over on downs at the Browns 11.\n\nOn the next play, Mayfield hit Beckham with a slant pass, and the receiver outran the Jets\u2018 defenders all the way to the end zone for an 89-yard TD that put Cleveland up 23-3 with 3:32 remaining in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cThat did it and that was huge for us,\u201d said running back Nick Chubb, who had a 19-yard TD run. \u201cWe took all the momentum away from them with that long run. After that, it was our game to lose.\u201d\n\nBeckham helped the Browns take a 3-0 lead on their first possession on Austin Seibert\u2019s 23-yard field goal - a drive highlighted by a spectacular 33-yard, one-handed grab that got Cleveland down to the Jets 4.\n\nIt was reminiscent of Beckham\u2019s highlight-reel, one-handed reception for the Giants on \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d as a rookie in 2014. On this one, Mayfield found Beckham down the right sideline, and the receiver stuck out his right hand to snare the ball behind Nate Hairston, starting in place of Trumaine Johnson - in nearly the same spot as his big catch five years ago.\n\nAnd, yes, Beckham was wearing his expensive watch - despite the NFL telling him last week not to.\n\nBeckham then had to come out of the game briefly because officials made him change his mirrored visor, saying it was reflective. He returned with a clear visor on his helmet.\n\nSeibert\u2019s 48-yarder gave the Browns a 6-0 lead with 6:15 left in the opening quarter as Cleveland outgained New York 101-4 in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to take a hard look at this and figure out what\u2019s going on,\u201d Jets coach Adam Gase said.\n\nNOW WHAT?\n\nSiemian was sidelined after throwing a long incomplete pass to Ryan Griffin. Cleveland\u2019s Myles Garrett slammed into him, and fell on top of him. Siemian appeared to roll his left ankle as Garrett, who was penalized for roughing the passer, sent him to the turf.\n\nSiemian was on crutches and his left foot in a walking boot in the locker room. He will have an MRI on Tuesday.\n\nFalk replaced Siemian with 7:58 left in the half and helped the Jets get their first points on a 46-yard field goal by Sam Ficken, the team\u2019s fourth kicker since July.\n\nSiemian finished 3 of 6 for 3 yards, while Falk was 20 of 25 for 198 yards as the Jets lost their seventh straight at home, dating to last season.\n\nSTATS\n\nMayfield, who beat the Jets last year in his NFL debut during a Thursday night game that ended Cleveland\u2019s 19-game winless skid, was 19 of 35 for 325 yards, including the TD to Beckham, and an interception. \u2026 Garrett had three of the Browns\u2019 four sacks. \u2026 Bell had 68 yards rushing on 21 carries and 10 catches for 61 yards for the Jets.\n\nEMOTIONAL RETURN\n\nBrowns defensive end Chris Smith played after his girlfriend, Petara Cordero, was killed in a car accident last week.\n\nThe 26-year-old Cordero was killed after she exited Smith\u2019s Lamborghini and was standing on the highway\u2019s shoulder when she was hit by an oncoming car.\n\nINJURIES\n\nBrowns: TE David Njoku sustained a concussion in the opening quarter and didn\u2019t return. \u2026 S Morgan Burnett injured his quadriceps.\n\nJets: LB Jordan Jenkins left in the first quarter with a calf injury. \u2026 WR Demaryius Thomas, making his Jets debut after being acquired from New England last week, injured a hamstring.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBrowns: host Los Angeles Rams next Sunday night in their second straight prime-time game.\n\nJets: at AFC East rival New England next Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Odell Beckham Jr. felt right at home again - in the end zone and on the highlight reels.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dennis Waszak Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/browns_jets_football_06230_c0-237-3161-2080_s1770x1032.jpg?9e3c06cef4b63314baed17c2ce90b1f2335db37e", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
