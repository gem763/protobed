Holding his bat high, Bregman took a half-dozen steps down the first-base line, watching his game-breaking slam sail over the fences. He added a late single for good measure as the Astros pulled even in the series, 2-2.\n\nA day earlier, the regular season MVP candidate was hitless in five-bats, stranding six runners and plunging him to 1 for 13 in the Series. Bregman wasn\u2019t daunted and showed why he\u2019s among the most self-assured players in baseball.\n\nBregman said he felt good swings coming. Asked about his teammate, Michael Brantley echoed that. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about Alex,\u201d Brantley said after a 4-1 win on Friday night. \u201cHe\u2019ll find his breaks. I can\u2019t wait to see him come out tomorrow, I\u2019m ready. You be ready, too.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long: Bregman pounced on the first pitch he saw, and the Astros led the rest of the way. Bregman delivered in a ballpark where he\u2019s had success, and in a city where his family has a legacy.\n\nLast year, Bregman\u2019s leadoff home run in the 10th inning at Nationals Park sent the American League to an 8-6 win and earned him the All-Star Game MVP award. A half-century ago, his grandfather was general counsel for the Washington Senators, the team that moved to become the Texas Rangers for the 1971 season, leaving the nation\u2019s capital without the national pastime until the Montreal Expos came in 2005.\n\nThe 25-year-old third baseman hit 41 homers with 112 RBIs this season. But with the Astros aiming to add to the championship they won in 2017, he\u2019d been stuck in neutral this week, aside from a home run in a 12-3 loss in Game 2. Even his usually sure-handed defense at third base had been subpar.\n\nBregman quickly got in gear on Saturday though. After Jose Altuve and Brantley singled with one out in the first off Patrick Corbin, Bregman lined a single to left-center for a 1-0 lead. Yuli Gurriel followed with an RBI single, and a pocket of Houston fans in the third deck began their chant of \u201cLet\u2019s go, Astros!\u201d\n\nBregman ended any doubt about Houston winning with his slam, a deep drive off Fernando Rodney that easily cleared the left-field wall. Bregman enjoyed the trip around the bases, and Astros teammates spilled from the dugout to greet him. Back on the bench, he held up four fingers. And way up above the right field foul pole, the cheer got louder and louder from the Astros fans: \u201cMVP! MVP!\u201d", "description": "Alex Bregman busted out of his slump with a grand-slam in the seventh, and the resurgent Astros routed the Nationals 8-1 on Saturday night in DC", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d2eeee33eab790c40d84a32b1458849af9d01fb/0_250_5057_3036/master/5057.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c3b96ccbea6414f978842acc1cdc8592", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
