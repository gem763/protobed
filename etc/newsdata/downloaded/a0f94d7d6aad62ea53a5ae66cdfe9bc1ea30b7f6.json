USA TODAY\n\nTORONTO \u2014 Nick Nurse thought he was ready for the Toronto Raptors\u2019 ring ceremony and raising of a championship banner.\n\nHe wasn't.\n\n\"It was a more lot more (emotional) than I thought it was going to be,\" the Toronto coach said. \"I guess I just didn\u2019t prepare myself very well. I thought they were just going to hand us a ring.\"\n\nThat\u2019s not how it works. Toronto\u2019s game-night operations staff produced a video, showing highlights from the Raptors\u2019 postseason run, including the Game 1 loss to the Orlando Magic in the first round, Kawhi Leonard\u2019s bounce-around-the-rim 3-pointer at the buzzer, and Kyle Lowry securing the basketball in the final seconds of Toronto\u2019s championship-clinching victory in Game 6 against Golden State.\n\n\"I haven\u2019t really watched many of those games, but you\u2019re around enough and see enough of the highlights and there\u2019s that shot he hit and that shot he hit. It\u2019s really something,\" Nurse said.\n\nCoaches like to look ahead, not back, especially when talking to reporters. But there\u2019s one game when a team must look back and appreciate what it accomplished. That\u2019s the season opener for the champions when they receive the elaborate, over-sized rings and see the banner unveiled.\n\n\"It\u2019s definitely going to an amazing feeling to be able to come back after your career is done and see that (banner) and be a part of that team, the first (Raptors) team to do it,\" guard Normal Powell said.\n\nFront office staffers, including president Masai Ujiri and general manager Bobby Webster, received their rings, then the coaching staff got theirs and finally the players, with the heartbeat of the Raptors, Kyle Lowry, the last one to get a ring from ownership after a hug from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver.\n\nZION INJURY: Rookie's absence deflates NBA season before it begins\n\nBOLD PREDICTIONS: Looking into the crystal ball for 2019-20 season\n\nAfter all that emotion, the Raptors still had a game to play against the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nNothing was going to take the shine off the 2019-20 season opener for the Raptors. Not even a loss to the Pelicans would\u2019ve ruined this night, a night Raptors fans waited 25 years for.\n\nThe Raptors made sure it was a perfect night, pulling out a 130-122 overtime victory over the Zion Williamson-less Pelicans.\n\nFresh off signing a four-year, $130 million extension, forward Pascal Siakam had 34 points, 18 rebounds and five assists. Fred VanVleet added 34 points and seven assists.\n\n\"We will see them grow all year and continue to see them flourish,\" said Lowry who finished with 22 points, six assists and five rebounds.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the little secret that won\u2019t be a secret for long: the Raptors are good, even without Kawhi Leonard (off the Clippers) and Danny Green (off to the Lakers).\n\nThe Raptors are the rare defending champs who most NBA followers aren\u2019t predicting to win their conference. The Raptors are also the rare defending champions whose best player left for another team after winning the title.\n\nBut they really don\u2019t care about predictions.\n\nWHO WE'RE WATCHING: 25 most interesting players for 2019-20\n\nSTAFF PICKS: Award and championship predictions for 2019-20\n\nAsked what he learned about the Raptors during the preseason, veteran big man Serge Ibaka said, \"We\u2019re still good, man. People are sleeping on us. We\u2019ve got players who can play, who have experience, confidence and mental toughness. We know how hard it is to win games, and we know how to play together. We don\u2019t give up. We\u2019re good man.\"\n\nToronto has a strong starting five with Lowry, Siakam, VanVleet, Marc Gasol and OG Anunoby, with Ibaka and Powell off the bench. Yes, they lack depth and will have to develop that end of the roster.\n\nBut Siakam is a potential All-Star, All-NBA and All-Defensive performer who is not Leonard but still a very talented and unique player the way he operates on both ends of the floor. He\u2019s going to get better, too.\n\nIbaka\u2019s sentiment is shared throughout Toronto\u2019s locker room.\n\n\"I keep saying this, there\u2019s some really special players on this team,\" Nurse said. \"They can do a lot. They like to guard. They know how to guard. They can move the ball. They can shoot the ball. I\u2019m expecting to have a really good team.\"\n\nFollow Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt.", "description": "The Raptors are the rare defending champs whose best player left after winning the title, but they really don't care about predictions.", "authors": ["Jeff Zillgitt", "Published A.M.
