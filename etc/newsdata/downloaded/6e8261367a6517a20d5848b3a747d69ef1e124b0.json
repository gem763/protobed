'In order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his Administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.'\n\nCipollone danced around the issue of a full House vote on an impeachment inquiry, stopping short of directly calling for one, because the GOP would likely lose in the Democratic-controlled chamber and some Republican lawmakers would be uneasy about being put in the politically tough spot of having to go on the record.\n\nTrey Gowdy came to national prominence when he chaired the House's select committee on Benghazi, where then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified in 2015\n\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone included political red meat in his scathing letter to Democrats on impeachment\n\nTrump has attacked both Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff and Speaker Nancy Pelosi\n\nPelosi had a strong response of her own.\n\n'Mr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable,' she said in a statement Tuesday night in response to Cipollone's letter.\n\n'This letter is manifestly wrong, and is simply another unlawful attempt to hide the facts of the Trump Administration's brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections,' Pelosi said.\n\n'Despite the White House's stonewalling, we see a growing body of evidence that shows that President Trump abused his office and violated his oath to 'protect, preserve and defend the Constitution',' she continued.\n\n'The President's actions threaten our national security, violate our Constitution and undermine the integrity of our elections. The White House letter is only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy, and to insist that the President is above the law,' Pelosi said.\n\nTrump has reacted furiously to the impeachment inquiry, using obscenities and insulting nicknames for Democratic lawmakers in posts on Twitter.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the president tweeted over 30 times in a three hour period, switching from railing about the impeachment inquiry into his presidency to justifying his decision to remove U.S. troops from Syria - a move that earned his criticism from lawmakers in both parties.\n\n'The Do Nothing Democrats are Con Artists, only looking to hurt the Republican Party and President. Their total focus is 2020, nothing more, and nothing less. The good news is that WE WILL WIN!!!!,' he complained at one point.\n\nTrump blocked EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland from testifying before Congress Tuesday\n\nAnd he lashed out at his favorite target, Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee who is leading the impeachment probe.\n\n'Adam Schiff is a disgrace to our Country!,' he tweeted.\n\nTuesday's back-and-forth between the White House and the Speaker's office offered a taste of the battle to come.\n\nIt followed Trump's decision to forbid European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland from testifying before Congress as scheduled - the administration's opening volley in the day's battle.\n\nDemocrats, in response, issued a subpoena for Sondland to appear before them next week.\n\nThe Democrats warned Sondland if he doesn't show up, even at the request of the president, it would be seen as an obstruction of their impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u2018Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena, including at the direction or behest of the president, the White House, or the State Department, shall constitute further evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the president,\u2019 the letter to him states.\n\nDemocrats called the president's blocking of Sondland from testifying Tuesday an 'obstruction' into their impeachment inquiry as the White House signaled it was ready to play hardball with their investigation.\n\n'We consider this interference to be obstruction of the impeachment inquiry. We will be issuing a subpoena to Ambassador Sondland for both his testimony and documents,' House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engle said in a joint statement Tuesday afternoon.\n\nSondland was scheduled to testify Tuesday morning voluntarily - meaning no subpoena had been necessary - when his attorney announced Sondland had been directed by the State Department not to appear, an order he had to obey as a department employee.\n\nIn addition to hearing from the ambassador, Democrats planned to question him about additional texts and emails that Schiff said were in his possession and were germane to the Democrats' investigation into the president.\n\nThe president argued he'd be sending his ambassador into a 'kangaroo court' if Sondland testified.\n\n'I would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see,' the president tweeted on Tuesday morning.\n\nThere have been questions about the role Sondland, whom Trump appointed as ambassador to the European Union, played in relationship between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTrump often acts in his own defense, making his case on Twitter and to journalists\n\nPresident Trump was on a Twitter tear Wednesday morning, issuing several tweets about the impeachment investigation\n\nTrump has attacked House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who is leading the Democrats' impeachment inquiry\n\nThe Ukraine is not in the EU yet Sondland took part in text messages among a group of diplomats trying to set up a meeting between Trump and Zelensky - an endeavor that led to allegations that Trump leveraged nearly $400 million in aid in order to secure a promise from Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nTrump has argued there was no 'quid pro quo' talk in American dealings with Kiev.", "description": "Donald Trump is bringing in Trey Gowdy, a staunch Republican ally and former member of Congress, to lead the fight against the impeachment inquiry into his presidency.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/16/19498914-0-image-a-40_1570635499905.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
