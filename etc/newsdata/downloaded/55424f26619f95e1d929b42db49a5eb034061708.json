That would be a stunning feat, more than doubling from the prior level of less than $20 billion in 2017.\n\nTotal US agriculture exports were $140 billion in 2018, so that increase would mean a third going to China.\n\n\u201cSo I suggest the farmers go immediately by more land and get bigger tractors,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of friction with China. Now it\u2019s a love fest,\u201d he said at the end of his meeting with Beijing\u2019s lead trade envoy, Vice Premier Liu He.\n\n\u2013 Mixed reaction \u2013\n\nAfter more than a year of trench warfare, however, it remained unclear whether the countries could sustain the momentum needed to conclude subsequent \u201cphases\u201d of the deal.\n\nTrump said it would take up to five weeks to conclude the first phase and get a deal on paper, which would cover some key issues like currency manipulation.\n\nBut he said he hoped to sign with Chinese leader Xi Jinping when they are both in Chile for the APEC leaders summit in mid November.\n\nHowever, some observers said the deal was underwhelming.\n\nGreg Daco of Oxford Economics called it an \u201citsy-bitsy-teeny-weeny handshake deal.\u201d\n\nThough it lays the foundation for a broader accord later, \u201cbehind the hype, this is nothing more than partial and ostensibly unsustainable deal lacking in real enforcement mechanisms,\u201d he said in an analysis.\n\n\u201cFor businesses this will mean less damage, not greater certainty.\u201d\n\nThe National Retail Federation said it was encouraged by the progress, adding, however: \u201cAlthough this is a step in the right direction, the uncertainty continues.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Rolling back tariff hikes \u2013\n\nBut even the incremental win could be a boon for Trump, who faces an impeachment firestorm and a stinging criticism in Congress for his treatment of Kurdish allies in Syria, only the latest episodes in the White House\u2019s perpetual turmoil.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters Washington will not impose the tariff increase on $250 billion in Chinese goods, which were set to rise to 30 percent from 25 percent on Tuesday next week.\n\nAnd US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the next round of tariffs due to hit on December 15 could be canceled.\n\n\u201cThe president has not made a final decision on that, but there was plenty of time to make that decision. That is certainly part of this process with the Chinese,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said the agreement will include new measures on enforcement.\n\nWhile the details are scant, Mnuchin said the sides made good progress on opening the Chinese economy to financial services, while including an agreement on preventing manipulation of the yuan.\n\nThe US Treasury in August branded China a currency manipulator, accusing Beijing of deliberately weakening the yuan to gain unfair trade advantages.\n\nTrump also said the deal would make some steps toward protecting American technology, a major focus of the trade frictions.\n\nSince the China trade war began last year, moments of comity and cheer have more than once been shattered, giving way to jolting deteriorations in relations between the two sides.\n\nChina has so far balked at Trump\u2019s demands for profound changes in the way Beijing manages its economy, which analysts say could politically undermine the Communist Party.\n\nLiu also praised the accord.\n\n\u201cWe very much agreed to get to the China-US economic relationship right. It is something good for China or for the United States and for the whole world,\u201d he told reporters at the White House.\n\n\u201cWe are making progress towards a positive direction.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Engulfed in an impeachment inquiry and other political turmoil, US President Donald Trump on Friday trumpeted the success of his", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/7672e9_us-president-donald-trump-meets-china-vice-premier-lead-trade-envoy-liu-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
