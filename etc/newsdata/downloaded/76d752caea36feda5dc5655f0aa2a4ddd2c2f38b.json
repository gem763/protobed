It is due to start producing power from late 2027.\n\nCannon-Brookes, who has been a vocal advocate for renewable energy in Australia, said the project could also expand to produce hydrogen fuel, which could be exported to markets such as Japan.\n\n\u201cThis will be absolutely great - with world-leading engineering required all up and down. But we can do it,\u201d he was quoted saying in the AFR.\n\nCannon-Brookes, 39, became a billionaire through his stake in the software firm Atlassian, which he co-founded with Scott Farquhar.\n\nHe made his name in the power sector in 2016 when he challenged Tesla Inc\u2019s (TSLA.O) Elon Musk via Twitter to build the world\u2019s biggest battery in 100 days to help prevent blackouts in South Australia, the country\u2019s most wind power reliant state.\n\nThe bet was dismissed as outrageous at the time, but Tesla built the battery on time and the project has since proven to be profitable in helping manage power supply on South Australia\u2019s shaky grid.\n\nWith solar panel prices rapidly falling, Sun Cable\u2019s main technical and cost hurdles will be the undersea transmission cable, said an energy consultant who will be highlighting the project at a solar power conference in Salt Lake City this week.\n\n\u201cCan you see the determining factors evolving in such a way in the next five years to make this project possible? Absolutely,\u201d said Gero Farruggio, managing director of Rystad Energy, by phone from Salt Lake City.\n\nGiven the scale and challenges of the project and its potential to compete with liquefied natural gas supply, Farruggio predicted the project would eventually attract an oil and gas player, especially if it involves producing hydrogen.", "description": "Atlassian Corp PLC co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes has pledged to help fund a A$20 billion ($14 billion) project to supply solar power from northern Australia to Singapore by a subsea cable, an Australian newspaper reported on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433660350&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0E3", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
