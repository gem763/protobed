Artificial turf isn't easy. But we will cope and come back with a victory.\"The match in Pyeongyang will be a unique experience for the players.There will be no South Korean cheering squad, the teams will play on astroturf, and the South Korean players have to follow regulations related to the UN's sanctions on the regime.They prohibit athletes from bringing mobile phones or tablet PCs into North Korea.While swapping jerseys at the end of the match is tradition in the sport, since South Korea's kit is made by an American sporting brand, this, too, will be forbidden.But some of the players welcome the restrictions.\"We can't even have books. I think it's good.
