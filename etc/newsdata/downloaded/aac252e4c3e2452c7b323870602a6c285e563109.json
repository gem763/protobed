That is an explosive subject in the country, and one that could well weaken the center and left still further. Netanyahu already sought to weaponize this sentiment when he indicated bluntly on Tuesday night that there can\u2019t and won\u2019t be an Israeli government dependent on Arab parties.\n\nThat is precisely where every right-wing populist party in the world would love to force its opposition \u2014 into a position of such electoral weakness that its only path to power involves having to reach out to groups or parties widely perceived to be outsiders and even enemies of the political community. This opens the center and left to the charge of disloyalty to the nation and inflames the anger of the right, which begins to identify its own political fate with the fate of the political community as a whole.", "description": "", "authors": ["Damon Linker", "Theweek.Com Articles Why-Israel-Envy-Rightwing-Populists-Around-World"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
