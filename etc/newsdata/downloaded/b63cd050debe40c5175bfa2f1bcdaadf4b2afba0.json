CGTN America has a newsroom in Washington and broadcasts to 30 million households across the country, according to The New York Times. CGTN is widely considered an unofficial mouthpiece of the Chinese government.\n\nHer remarks came two days after Trump's newest batch of tariffs on Chinese goods went into effect Sunday. The 15% levies on apparel, footwear, consumer electronics and toys represent the latest escalation in the U.S.-China trade dispute. Additional duties on products, such as smartphones and laptops, are set to go into place Dec. 15. Together, those two rounds would cover about $300 billion worth of Chinese imports.\n\nTrump is also threatening to increase the tariff rate on Oct. 1 to 30% on roughly $250 billion of goods that are already subject to 25% duties.\n\nShortly before Liu's appearance on CNBC, Trump tweeted that the U.S. is doing \"very well\" in its negotiations with China.\n\nLiu, however, said Trump's latest tariffs are hurting the likelihood of in-person trade talks later this month. \"The United States will need to create the conditions that are conducive for the resumption of negotiations.\"\n\n\"Trump's decision to put additional tariffs ... is not in the right direction for talks to resume very soon,\" she added. She insisted that China wants an end to the trade war and doesn't want the situation to get worse. But she said the Chinese government will continue to protect its interests.\n\nIn retaliation, the Chinese government pushed ahead Sunday with increased duties of 5% to 10% on a variety of major American goods exported to China, including soybeans and crude oil.\n\nHowever, those tariffs account for only about a third of the more than 5,000 product lines listed in Beijing's latest announcement. The majority of China duties against U.S. goods take effect Dec. 15, along with reinstatement of tariffs on U.S. autos and auto parts.", "description": "Instead of focusing on Trump's day-to-day comments, the Chinese people want to see his actions in the U.S.-China trade war.", "authors": ["Kevin Stankiewicz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106109308-1567526971177liu-xin-4.jpg?v=1567527022"}
