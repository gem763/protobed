They have two sons and live in Dallas, Texas\n\nThe Christian Brothers \u2013 \u201ckind of like monks,\u201d says Dreux \u2013 would not have been happy to know that two teenage girls had broken into the dormitory of their all-boys\u2019 boarding school in Louisiana. \u201cThese men had taken vows of poverty and celibacy, and they didn\u2019t deal with women very well at all.\u201d\n\nDreux was 18, and was working at his old school during the holidays, helping to run its summer camp. He had been having a shower when one of the boys ran in to tell him two girls were in the dormitory. \u201cI threw on a towel, ran out and met these two young ladies and said: \u2018You can\u2019t be here,\u2019\u201d he recalls.\n\nOne of them was Dianne, who was accompanying her friend Penny, who was trying to find her boyfriend, also working on the camp. They didn\u2019t know which room was his, so they went round knocking on doors until they found one that was open. Dreux smiles. \u201cThis is a secure residence \u2013 there are minors here. The doors are supposed to be locked. Someone must have left a door unlocked intentionally. All the young men were very excited to find young ladies in the dormitory.\u201d\n\nHe told the pair he would find Penny\u2019s boyfriend and meet them in a nearby bar. Then he got other camp staff to cover his night duty. \u201cThere was no debate, I was going out,\u201d he says, determined to get to know Dianne.\n\n\u201cI was intrigued by the audaciousness of a young lady who was willing to be adventurous in this way,\u201d he says. That was the first impression. The lasting impression was from the conversations we had that night. She was wicked smart and intrigued me to a level that I had never felt before.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dreux and Dianne in 1991. Photograph: Dianne Bourque\n\nWhat did Dianne, who had met Dreux when he was wearing only a towel, like about him? \u201cI thought he was really handsome,\u201d she says. That night they talked about what they hoped for in life. \u201cWhere we want to be, our dreams and aspirations,\u201d says Dreux.\n\nThey kissed and made plans to see each other the following weekend. Then, for the next three years, they lived about 90 minutes from each other \u2013 Dianne was training to be a nurse, and Dreux was at college \u2013 seeing each other at weekends and speaking on the phone a couple of times a week. \u201cWe would spend hours talking, and to this day we just spend a large part of our relationship in great conversation,\u201d she says. \u201cHe is my best friend, my husband, my lover, father of my kids, but at the end of the day I really just tremendously enjoy his company.\u201d\n\nDianne says she knew she wanted to be with Dreux long-term fairly quickly. \u201cHe was different,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was smart and engaging, and I knew really early on he was pretty special. At 18, most boys are all about the chemistry. That was important, but he wanted to know who I was. There was a book called 1,001 Questions and we would sit and ask questions from this book for hours: \u2018What does your brain think about this? What does your heart think about this?\u2019\u201d\n\nDreux was less keen to settle down: \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to be in a committed relationship. That really wasn\u2019t what I was hoping for.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were 18, it\u2019s fine,\u201d says Dianne.\n\nDreux continues: \u201cShe was very patient with me, and I don\u2019t know why she waited. Eventually, she rattled my cage and said: \u2018Enough \u2013 you\u2019re going to have to make a decision.\u2019\u201d\n\nThey married six years after they met, and moved to Dallas in Texas where they raised their two sons. Why has their relationship lasted? \u201cI think because we put each other first,\u201d says Dreux. \u201cAnd he\u2019s funny,\u201d says Dianne. \u201cWe love each other, but we really like each other. It\u2019s like having your best friend be your roommate \u2013 it\u2019s just fun.\u201d\n\nIt took years, she says with a laugh, before she would tell people how they met. \u201cWe\u2019re straitlaced individuals. It\u2019s so embarrassing and it\u2019s not really who I am today.\u201d Dreux smiles: \u201cAs she reminds me, I married a criminal.\u201d\n\nWant to share your story?
