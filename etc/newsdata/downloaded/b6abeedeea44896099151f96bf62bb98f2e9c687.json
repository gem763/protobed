Filmmakers build Paradise Valley set", "language": "en", "text": "LIVINGSTON, Mont. (AP) - With a Montana International Film Festival screening of their latest movie, \u201cRobert the Bruce,\u201d on the horizon, a group of local filmmakers is intent on making Livingston the Hollywood of the North.\n\nReal estate developer and area native Carter Boehm and his production company, Ponderosa Films, partnered with Livingston\u2019s own Soundcolor Studios to build a medieval village on Boehm\u2019s Cokedale ranch to serve as the setting for the \u201cBraveheart\u201d sequel starring actor Angus MacFadyen reprising his role as Robert the Bruce.\n\nThe movie is scheduled to close out the Montana International Film Festival, held in Billing\u2019s Babcock Theatre, at 3 p.m. Sunday, the Livingston Enterprise reported . A question-and-answer session with the director Richard Gray and MacFadyen is slated to follow the screening.\n\nFollowing the success of this project, Boehm and company have set their sights on a movie set a little closer to home. Ponderosa Films recently purchased the rights to a Western movie, details of which the company declined to disclose.\n\nSoundcolor Studios, led by local brothers Abram and Michael Boise, is hard at work constructing a sprawling 28-building Old Western town on land just south of Chico Hot Springs.\n\nWhile some of the buildings are movie set facades, the majority are actual buildings with working electricity and plumbing. The designers incorporated Hollywood-centric features into each structure, such as small nooks that house movie cameras to better shoot interior scenes and platforms with the sole purpose of providing space for a gunfight.\n\nSeemingly every Western movie troupe has been accounted for. The \u201ctown\u201d also boasts a church with a 62-foot-tall bell tower. If a script involves a less affluent town, the bell tower can be reconfigured to reflect that. If the script calls for the burning of the church, the actual church can be removed with a crane and replaced with an expendable stand-in.\n\nThe goal, Boehm said, is to create a ready-made Western set that can be reused for multiple movie productions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an \u2018if you build it, they will come\u2019 situation, we hope,\u201d Boehm said. \u201cThe more it morphed, the more we kept asking, \u2018Why don\u2019t we build an actual town?\u2019\u201d\n\nA film tax credit passed by the 2019 Montana Legislature and recently signed into law by Gov. Steve Bullock only further plays into their hand.\n\nGray, who is signed on to direct the company\u2019s upcoming Western film, said there are only a handful of locations similar to Boehm\u2019s Paradise Valley model town. A few John Wayne classics were filmed at a facility in the Arizona desert, but after Arizona did away with its film tax credit, the movie industry largely relocated future productions to New Mexico to take advantage of the neighboring state\u2019s lax tax laws.\n\nGray said the opportunities to shoot at such a facility in a mountainous wooded area are even fewer, with most companies electing to shoot their movies in Canada.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping they will come back from Canada, these U.S. productions,\u201d Gray said. \u201cWith this film tax credit, jobs are increasing.\u201d\n\nAs was the case during the production of \u201cRobert the Bruce,\u201d Boehm said he intends to hire mostly locals for the upcoming Western production.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be mostly Montanans working here. I\u2019m a big believer of that,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to employing mostly locals, future productions will also drive business to nearby Chico Hot Springs Resort, less than a five-minute drive from the Western town, Gray said.\n\n\u201cWe have the facilities for lodging and catering just over the hill,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the resort is a logical choice for shouldering the lion\u2019s share of lodging, the movie set itself will also be equipped to handle real-life events.\n\n\u201cThis is primarily a film studio, but nearly everything is multipurpose as well,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThe town hall, for example, can be used for green screens, production offices or a music venue.\u201d\n\nThe town\u2019s saloon will boast an industrial kitchen and a working bar, and its upstairs \u201cbrothel\u201d will double as rentable rooms.\n\nBoehm suggested a scenario in which the movie set, with its church, town hall and saloon, could host a wedding.\n\nBoehm\u2019s land that houses the movie set is surrounded by federally owned land, ensuring the viewshed is maintained. Its topography allows for other sets - the construction of an American Indian village is already in the works - to be erected nearby without being visible from other sets.\n\n\u201cThis was all planned for this purpose,\u201d Boehm said. \u201cMy goal is to make Livingston the new Hollywood.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Livingston Enterprise, http://www.livingstonenterprise.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With a Montana International Film Festival screening of their latest movie, \"Robert the Bruce,\" on the horizon, a group of local filmmakers is intent on making Livingston the Hollywood of the North.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Noah Lister"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
