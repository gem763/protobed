There's a first start in two months for Luka Modric, though, back from injury. Gareth Bale is rested and not involved in the squad. And here's the Brugge team! Advertisement Real Madrid know the importance of a victory tonight. Their 3-0 defeat against Paris Saint-Germain in the opening game of Group A has left them playing catch up, and they can't afford any more slip ups. Club Brugge, meanwhile, will hope to frustrate Zinedine Zidane's side. The fans at the Bernabeu are notoriously impatient, and things might get edgy if the game doesn't go as planned for Real Madrid. Here's Dermot Corrigan's piece on the weekend's Madrid derby, which ended goalless: How Real and Atletico cancelled one another out in Madrid phoney war Eden Hazard has yet to really get going as a Real Madrid player. He starts again tonight, and has highlighted the importance of making an impact: \"I'm not a Galactico yet. I have to show that I can be one,\" said Hazard. \"We all know the history of the number seven shirt at this club and I want to show I can be the best in the world. I want to give my all, not just in matches but in training too. \"I can do better, I'm critical of myself as well, but working every day we will change things. \"Not everything is perfect but we're first in La Liga, we lost in Paris, maybe I was set back because of the injury but now I'm at 100% and hope to give my all in the coming games.\" Advertisement Zidane has backed Hazard to find his feet at the Bernabeu, too. \"I know he will triumph here but the important thing is to be calm and back him,\" said the Frenchman. \"I know how it works, I was worse when I arrived in Italy. There, I took three months [to hit form], at Madrid a bit less.\" Real Madrid last played Club Brugge way back in the 1976-77 season in the European Cup. And it was the Belgian side that came out on top, progressing to the quarter-finals with a 2-0 aggregate victory. Karim Benzema has enjoyed an excellent start to the season, scoring five goals in six La Liga appearances and reestablishing himself as Real Madrid's leading man.

Real Madrid 0-0 Club Brugge 3 minutes The hosts, as expected, are seeing most of the ball early on but Brugge look a capable side on the break. Tau very nearly races clear, but he's brought down on halfway and the chance of a counter attack is ended. Advertisement Real Madrid 0-0 Club Brugge 5 minutes Benzema finds space on the left and drives into the box. He spots the overlapping run of Nacho, feeding the ball into the path of the full back. His ball across is blocked behind for a corner, from which Benzema heads just wide. Real Madrid 0-0 Club Brugge 9 minutes Brugge have the ball in Real Madrid's net! But the flag is up. An impressive spell of possession from the visitors ends with a through ball into the path of Tau, who races in behind the Real Madrid defence and squares for Dennis. He miscontrols and watches as the ball rolls past Courtois and in. VAR will check it. GOAL! GOAL! Real Madrid 0-1 Club Brugge (Dennis) 11 minutes The goal is given! A long VAR check eventually leads to the conclusion that Dennis was onside. So Brugge lead at the Bernabeu, and now the pressure is really on the hosts. Real Madrid 0-1 Club Brugge 14 minutes There are already a few signs of discontent around the Bernabeu. As it stands, Real Madrid have no points from two games, with no goals scored and four conceded. Brugge look increasingly dangerous when they look to go in behind Real's high line too.
