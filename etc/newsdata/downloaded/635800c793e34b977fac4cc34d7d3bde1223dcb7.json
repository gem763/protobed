Not as happy as they can be because there is still a game to go as we\u2019ve said.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Jones paid tribute to Willi Heinz after the back-up scrum-half saw his dreams of playing in a World Cup final crushed by a tournament-ending hamstring injury suffered against New Zealand.\n\nJones picked just two specialist scrum-halves in his 31-man squad for Japan.\n\nBen Spencer arrived in Tokyo on Monday as cover for first-choice number nine Ben Youngs, with the Saracens scrum-half now having just a few days to prepare for a World Cup final.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough for Willi, he\u2019s a very well-liked member of the squad and he was in tears in the dressing room,\u201d said Jones.\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s collected himself, he now knows he\u2019s got another role to play for us.\u201d\n\nJones added: \u201cThe great thing is Willi wanted to stay and we wanted him to stay so it wasn\u2019t a hard discussion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when you want to get married mate. If the lady wants to marry you and you offer to marry, it\u2019s a pretty easy conversation.\n\n\u201cHe works hard for the team, Ben (Youngs) and him have got a really good relationship and even now he\u2019s already started to mentor Ben Spencer. He\u2019s a really great team man.\u201d\n\nSpencer\u2019s three replacement caps amount to just over 20 minutes of Test rugby in total but Jones said: \u201cBen has been in and around the squad consistently for the last couple of years so he knows the game, he knows the players.\n\n\u201cWe always said to those guys outside the 31 that they need to be ready, and he is ready to go.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Eddie Jones has responded in typically sharp fashion after Wales coach Warren Gatland questioned whether England had played their", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/4e1ecf_england-coach-eddie-jones-had-sharp-response-comments-warren-gatland-enjoy-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
