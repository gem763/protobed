The biggest lie being told by the administration is that ISIS is defeated,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham told \u201cFox and Friends\u201d in a phone call Monday. \u201cThe Caliphate is destroyed, but there\u2019s thousands of fighters\u201d still there.\n\nGraham said he would sponsor a resolution urging Trump to reconsider the decision he called \u201cshortsighted and irresponsible.\u201d Graham said he and Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen will also introduce a resolution to impose sanctions on Turkey if it invades Syria.\n\nThe sharp criticism from Graham, a South Carolina Republican who usually is one of Trump\u2019s fiercest defenders in the Senate, signals the president\u2019s plan could meet resistance on Capitol Hill. Other Republican lawmakers were joining in expressing misgivings on Monday, echoing the admonishment that prompted Trump to reverse course on a similar pullout announced last year.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, said on Twitter that \u201cthe Trump administration has made a grave mistake that will have implications far beyond Syria.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Peter King, a Republican from New York, tweeted that the move \u201cbetrays Kurds, strengthens ISIS and endangers American homeland.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s former United Nations ambassador, Nikki Haley, emphasized the risks of the U.S. abandoning allies in the Mideast. \u201cWe must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back,\u201d she said on Twitter. \u201cThe Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake.\u201d\n\nEven before the pushback, Trump was defending his decision Monday, insisting on Twitter that the U.S. can\u2019t afford to be stuck in \u201cridiculous endless wars.\u201d The U.S. was only supposed to be in Syria for 30 days but stayed and \u201cgot deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight,\u201d Trump tweeted, insisting he\u2019d held off this fight for almost three years.\n\nTrump\u2019s move represents a significant shift in U.S. policy that raises questions about the fate of tens of thousands of Islamic State detainees and casts further doubt on the reliability of the U.S. as an ally in the region.\n\nTrump said Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to \u201cfigure the situation out, and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their \u2018neighborhood.\u201d\u2019\n\nThe White House said Turkey would take responsibility for any Islamic State fighters captured in the area over the past two years. It gave no details and it wasn\u2019t immediately clear what, if any, plan the NATO allies had agreed to handle the detainees or how they would be transferred to Turkish custody.\n\nBut the assurance represents a potential win for Trump, who has insisted that the U.S. would bear no responsibility for any Islamic State detainees, as he gears up for the 2020 election.\n\nClose U.S. Ally\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have been a close U.S. ally in the fight to defeat Islamic State. But Turkey considers Syria\u2019s Kurdish militants a threat to its national security, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said his forces are ready to begin a military operation against them in northeastern Syria.\n\nThe U.S. in 2015 provided air support for Kurdish militias to retake the critical town of Kobani from Islamic State and has since used Kurdish fighters as ground troops in the campaign to clear Syria of the group.\n\nTrump\u2019s approach to Syria has previously caused friction with administration officials. Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, resigned last December after Trump said the U.S. would withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan -- a decision Trump later reversed.\n\nGraham, who has not shied from criticizing other Trump moves on foreign policy, said that fatigue with the fight is not a reason to abandon it. Leaving the U.S. wartime Kurdish allies will only make it harder to find allies in the future, he warned.\n\n\u201cIf we abandon them, good luck getting anybody to help America in the future with radical Islam, al Qaeda and ISIS,\u201d Graham said. \u201cYou may be tired of fighting radical Islam, but they\u2019re not tired of fighting you.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- One of Donald Trump\u2019s biggest defenders in Congress rebuked the president\u2019s decision to step aside from Kurdish allies in Syria while Turkey\u2019s military advances, saying it would result in the re-emergence of ISIS.\u201cISIS is not defeated, my friend.
