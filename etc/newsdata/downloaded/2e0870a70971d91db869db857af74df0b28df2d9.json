REUTERS/Manaure Quintero\n\nColombia has long accused Maduro of sheltering rebel fighters and crime gang members. The allegations reached a fever pitch last month when former commanders from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) announced a rearmament in a video Colombian officials say was filmed in Venezuela.\n\nPresident Ivan Duque said in a speech to the United Nations last week that he would give the organisation a dossier of \u201cconclusive proof\u201d of Maduro\u2019s support for terrorist groups.\n\nThe dossier included years-old, uncredited photos from news agencies taken in Colombia - not in Venezuela - which led Maduro to dismiss the dossier\u2019s contents and sparked widespread criticism of Duque from media outlets and NGOs.\n\nThe armed forces\u2019 head of intelligence, General Oswaldo Pena, was removed from his post because of the photographs, high-level government and military sources told Reuters.\n\nA statement from the defence ministry said Pena had resigned because of \u201cthe necessity of responding for my actions.\u201d\n\nColombian officials defended the report\u2019s conclusions earlier on Monday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just an issue of design and of giving credit at the foot of the photos,\u201d Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo told journalists. \u201cIn consequence, we are going to update using the armed forces\u2019 exclusive photos.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important is the grave threat of the Maduro regime to the peace and stability of Colombia...to the peace, the security and stability of the region,\u201d Trujillo said.\n\nThe head of the national police, General Oscar Atehortua, showed photographs of three leaders from the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels he said were taken in Venezuelan cities and obtained from confiscated devices.\n\nAn ELN leader known by his nom de guerre Pablito is hiding in the Venezuelan province of Apure, officials said.\n\n\u201cVenezuela is serving as a sanctuary for the leaders of the ELN and (FARC dissidents),\u201d Defense Minister Guillermo Botero said. \u201cThey have bank accounts, they launder money, they do tourism, they have properties there without the authorities doing anything at all.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Bogota said in a statement it \u201cfully backed\u201d the report\u2019s conclusions.\n\nColombia is among more than 50 countries that recognise opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader.\n\nMaduro accuses Colombia of preparing to attack Venezuela, and says Guaido is a U.S. puppet.", "description": "Colombia on Monday publicly defended a dossier it says proves Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro supports guerrilla groups and drug traffickers but removed the armed forces' head of intelligence after widespread criticism of the report.", "authors": ["Luis Jaime Acosta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435586466&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T15C", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
