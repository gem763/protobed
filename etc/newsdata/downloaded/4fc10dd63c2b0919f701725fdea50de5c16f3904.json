He also questioned the current administration's credibility, adding, \"I never lied.\"\n\n\"It's not a place that I recognize,\" Carney said, referring to the current White House.\n\nWhen asked about Amazon's massive market power and the growing scrutiny on potential anticompetitive behavior, Carney said there's a misperception about Amazon's true size. He pointed to the oft-cited figure of Amazon accounting for less than 4% of retail in the U.S. and less than 1% globally, while saying Amazon's roughly 40% market share in U.S. e-commerce was less relevant given almost all major retailers are in both online and physical commerce these days.\n\n\"What I found around the country, and sometimes around the world, is that the perception of Amazon is a little different from the reality,\" Carney said.\n\nCarney, who joined Amazon in 2015, is one of the most senior officials at Amazon. He runs both the press and policy teams, and reports directly to CEO Jeff Bezos.\n\n\n\nFollow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech industry news.", "description": "Amazon's SVP of global affairs Jay Carney, who was Obama's press secretary, criticized the Trump administration during at a tech conference on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Eugene Kim"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105979942-1561058147097ap_343946671953.jpg?v=1561058210", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
