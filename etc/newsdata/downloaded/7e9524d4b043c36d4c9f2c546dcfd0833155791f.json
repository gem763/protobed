Too bad, court rules.", "language": "en", "text": "But now it was just a neighborhood crime scene, the suburban home where an armed Walmart shoplifting suspect randomly barricaded himself after fleeing the store on a June afternoon in 2015. For 19 hours, the suspect holed up in a bathroom as a SWAT team fired gas munition and 40 mm rounds through the windows, drove an armored vehicle through the doors, tossed flash-bang grenades inside and used explosives to blow out the walls.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe suspect was captured alive, but the home was utterly destroyed, eventually condemned to be demolished by the City of Greenwood Village.\n\nThat left Leo Lech\u2019s son, John Lech \u2014 who lived there with his girlfriend and her 9-year-old son \u2014 without a home. The city refused to compensate the Lech family for their losses, but offered $5,000 in temporary rental assistance.\n\nNow, after the Leches sued, a federal appeals court has decided what else the city owes the Lech family for destroying their house more than four years ago: nothing.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled that the city is not required to compensate the Lech family for their lost home because it was destroyed by police while they were trying to enforce the law, rather than taken by eminent domain.\n\nAD\n\nThe Lechs had sued under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Takings Clause, which guarantees citizens compensation if their property is seized by the government for public use. But the court said that Greenwood Village was acting within its \u201cpolice power\u201d when it damaged the house, which the court said doesn\u2019t qualify as a \u201ctaking\u201d under the Fifth Amendment. The court acknowledged that this may seem \u201cunfair,\u201d but when police have to protect the public, they can\u2019t be \u201cburdened with the condition\u201d that they compensate whoever is damaged by their actions along the way.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt just goes to show that they can blow up your house, throw you out on the streets and say, \u2018See you later. Deal with it,\u2019\u201d Leo Lech said in an interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday. \u201cWhat happened to us should never happen in this country, ever.\u201d\n\nLeo Lech said he is considering appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. Police must be forced to draw the line at some point, he said \u2014 preferably before a house is wholly gutted \u2014 and be held accountable if innocent bystanders lose everything as a result of the actions of law enforcement.\n\nAD\n\nBack in June 2015, the standoff at Lech\u2019s suburban Denver home captivated and alarmed the public, as their house at the end of the street, one located by a baseball field complex and a park, suddenly turned into a quasi-war zone.\n\nThe suspect, Robert Jonathan Seacat, had stolen a shirt and a couple belts from a Walmart in neighboring Aurora, Colo., and then fled in a Lexus, according to a police affidavit. A police officer pursued him in a high-speed chase until Seacat parked his car near a light rail station, hopped a nearby fence leading to the interstate, and then crossed five lanes of traffic on foot. He climbed the fence on the other side \u2014 and then, shortly thereafter, came upon the Lech residence.\n\nAD\n\nA 9-year-old boy, John Lech\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s son, was home alone at the time, waiting for his mom to return from the grocery store, Lech said. He told police he was watching YouTube videos in his room when he heard the alarm trip, according to the affidavit. He emerged to find a man walking up the stairs, holding a gun. \u201cHe said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to hurt anybody. I just want to get away,'\" Lech recalled. Minutes later, the boy walked out of the house unharmed.\n\nAD\n\nSeacat then began searching the house for car keys. But by the time he got in the car parked in Lech\u2019s garage, police had pulled into the driveway. Seacat fired a shot at them through the garage, the affidavit says.\n\nThus began the 19-hour standoff.\n\n\u201cThey proceed to destroy the house \u2014 room, by room, by room, by room,\u201d Lech said. \u201cThis is one guy with a handgun. This guy was sleeping. This guy was eating. This guy was just hanging out in this house. I mean, they proceeded to blow up the entire house.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSWAT officers attempted to enter the home on one occasion but retreated after believing they heard Seacat fire several rounds. After other tactics including tear gas, robots and police negotiations repeatedly failed, SWAT officers tried again to enter the home at 8:21 a.m. the next morning. They found him holed up in a bathroom with a stash of drugs, where he was disarmed and arrested.\n\nAD\n\nWhen the Lech family was allowed back on the property to retrieve their belongings, they were aghast at what they found.\n\nJohn Lech, his girlfriend and her son moved in with Leo Lech and his wife, who lived 30 miles away, requiring John to change jobs. The $5,000 offered by the city \u201cwas insulting,\u201d Leo Lech said.\n\nHis out-of-pocket expenses to rebuild the house cost him nearly $400,000, he said.\n\n\u201cThis has ruined our lives,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nThe city did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Tuesday night, but police have previously defended force its actions during the standoff.\n\n\u201cMy mission is to get that individual out unharmed and make sure my team and everyone else around including the community goes home unharmed,\u201d Greenwood Village Police Commander Dustin Varney said in 2015, KUSA reported. \u201cSometimes that means property gets damaged, and I am sorry for that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nState and federal courts have ruled differently in cases involving innocent homeowners caught in the crosshairs of deadly police raids, although the 10th Circuit was more persuaded by courts ruling in police\u2019s favor.\n\nLech\u2019s lawyers pointed to a 1991 Minnesota case in which the state Supreme Court sided with a woman whose house was damaged by police with tear gas as they sought to apprehend a suspect. In a 1980 Houston case, the Texas Supreme Court awarded damages to a couple whose home was badly damaged as police sought to apprehend three suspects who barricaded themselves inside.\n\nAD\n\nIn that case, the Texas court stuck its nose up at the principle the 10th circuit stuck to so closely in its ruling: that unless a government\u2019s action is clearly labeled \u201ceminent domain,\u201d citizens aren\u2019t entitled to compensation if the police destroy their property as a matter of business.\n\nAD\n\n\u201c[T]his court has moved beyond the earlier notion that the government\u2019s duty to pay for taking property rights is excused by labeling the taking as an exercise of police powers,\u201d the Texas court wrote at the time.\n\nToday, the Lechs\u2019 Greenwood Village home has been rebuilt. Lech says he is now dipping into his 401(k) to afford the legal battle, but intends to continue as long as he is able. He thinks he has too much bad luck to make it to the Supreme Court, but believes sooner or later that someone else like him will get there.\n\n\u201cThis can\u2019t go on in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has to be a limit. There has to be accountability.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cIt just goes to show that they can blow up your house, throw you out on the streets and say, 'See you later.
