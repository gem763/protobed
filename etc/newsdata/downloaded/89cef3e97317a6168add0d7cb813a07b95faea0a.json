In his appeal, Kahler\u2019s lawyers will argue before the high court that denying the defense abridges due process, according to the news service.\n\n\u201cMaybe they will establish some ground rules,\u201d Jeffrey Jackson, a law professor at Washburn University in Topeka, told the AP. \u201cThey\u2019ve been vague about what the standard is, and maybe now they\u2019re going to tell us.\u201d\n\nKansas previously allowed a defense based on English law allowing the insanity defense in cases where a defendant is impaired past the point of recognizing their conduct as criminal. Since 1996, however, the state is one of a handful with a stricter law that only allows defendants to cite \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d as a partial defense and requires proof the defendant did not mean to commit the specific crime.\n\n\u201cJohn Hinckley intended to kill President Reagan. He would not have had a defense in Kansas,\u201d Christopher Slobogin, a professor of both law and psychiatry at the Vanderbilt University, told the AP. \u201cName an insanity case, the person would not have had a defense in Kansas.\u201d\n\nSlobogin argued such state laws, which are also on the books in Alaska, Idaho, Montana and Utah, bars the defense for virtually any crime committed as a result of delusions.\n\n\u201cScholars and practitioners have struggled for literally hundreds of years to decide to how to handle evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s mental condition,\u201d Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt told the AP. \u201cKansas is merely continuing the long tradition of trying different approaches.\u201d", "description": "The U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/scotus_supremecourt_012219gn12.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
