I think I hit every green and made a couple putts early,\u201d said Thomas, who also shot 63 in the opening round two years ago on the way to victory.\n\n\u201cAnd then the back nine, I got a few close to the holes where those birdies came easier. So it just was a very easy 63, if you can somehow say that.\u201d\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s An, who shot 69, shares second on 11-under going into the weekend with Seoul-born New Zealander Danny Lee, whose 66 could have been better but for a bogey at 18.\n\nKoepka, the winner at the Nine Bridges course a year ago, had a day to forget with five bogeys in his three-over par round and ended the day 13 shots off the lead.\n\nThe best player in the world wasn\u2019t even the best player in his family \u2014 little brother Chase Koepka shot a level-par 72 to go into the weekend at two-under par, two shots better than his famous sibling.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Work to do\u2019 \u2013\n\nA rejuvenated Jordan Spieth rolled home five birdies in his last seven holes in a putting masterclass to card a 65 and move into contention.\n\nThe three-time major winner and former world number one shares fourth place on nine-under par with Emiliano Grillo of Argentina, who carded a 66.\n\nThe 26-year-old Texan has not won a tournament for two years but felt he was close to his majestic best Friday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still some work to do for sure, I\u2019d call it \u2018B\u2019 ball control but I was \u2018A-plus\u2019 putting,\u201d Spieth told AFP.\n\n\u201cJust got to go out tomorrow and hit as many greens as possible and keep rolling it the way I\u2019ve been rolling it.\u201d\n\nThomas, the inaugural CJ Cup winner in 2017, blasted out of the blocks on a blustery morning on the side of Mount Halla, Korea\u2019s highest mountain that dominates Jeju Island.\n\nHe birdied each of the first four holes to get to eight-under par and another on the eighth put him within striking distance of the Korean.\n\nAn\u2019s round got going around the turn with four birdies from his eighth to 11th holes.\n\n\u201cI guess my putting was pretty good. I didn\u2019t miss any short putts and a couple of long ones dropped, that definitely helped,\u201d said An.\n\nThomas started the back nine with his sixth birdie and another on the par-five 12th drew him level.\n\nA three at the par-four 14th gave him the outright lead and a two-putt birdie at the par-five 18th provided a two-shot cushion going into the weekend.", "description": "Jeju (South Korea) (AFP) \u2013 Justin Thomas shot a stunning nine-under 63 Friday on Jeju Island to take control of the CJ Cup from home favourite An", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/0b8289_easy-63-justin-thomas-thomas-leads-cj-cup-easy-63-on-koepka-day-forget-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
