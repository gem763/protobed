We have argued, and still argue, for a Final Say referendum to let the British people sort out the impasse in Parliament.\n\nI still think we can win that second referendum in this Parliament. But, if we don\u2019t, then it looks like the other parties will try to settle Brexit by a general election. And that\u2019s why I am looking forward to debating our response to a Brexit general election at our party conference this weekend.\n\nIf voters back is at the next election, Liberal Democrats will make the Brexit mess stop. Immediately. We will revoke Article 50, and keep the UK in the EU.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Being pro-EU is in our DNA: internationalism, tearing down walls rather than building them, is at the heart of who we are as a party. At a time when nationalism and authoritarianism are rearing their ugly heads we will speak up and defend these values with all our might.\n\nChoosing to adopt a policy of a People\u2019s Vote with the option to stay in the EU after the referendum result was a bold decision \u2013 but it was the right one. The ballot paper we were all faced with in 2016 did not have any details about what Brexit would look like; about what it would mean for the Irish border, for our NHS, or for EU citizens.\n\nIt was not a final decision, but the start of a process \u2013 a process that has taken far longer and cost far more than we were ever told it would\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That is why we have always argued for a Final Say on the deal, and it is why we are now arguing that if, instead of a referendum, the other parties insist on a general election, then a Liberal Democrat majority government, elected on an unequivocal \"Stop Brexit\" manifesto, would move immediately to revoke Article 50.\n\nIf we win that election it would give us a clear democratic mandate to bring an end to this mess and stop Brexit. We will have gone back to the people. Labour and the Tories will put their red and blue versions of Brexit forward, and the Liberal Democrats will be clear about stopping Brexit and keeping the UK together.\n\nWe are ready to go. This year alone we have fought the local elections, the European elections, and a number of by-elections on our Stop Brexit message and we have done incredibly well. We have gained councillors, MEPs, an MSP, and many fantastic new MPs too. We are the UK\u2019s biggest, strongest Remain party, and we\u2019re a long way from done.\n\nWorking with Remainers across the country and from different parties we have fought tirelessly to stop a catastrophic no-deal. But we are clear that the fight does not stop here. Liberal Democrats will not rest until we have stopped Brexit.\n\nUnder Theresa May and Boris Johnson, aided and abetted by Jeremy Corbyn, Brexit has become a national embarrassment. Corbyn is a lifelong Brexiter and Johnson a lifelong charlatan. Neither should be trusted with the future of this country.\n\nI look forward to debating this motion at our party Conference this weekend. Under this new policy, a Liberal Democrat majority government with Jo Swinson as our prime minister will not renegotiate Brexit. We will bring an end to this mess. We will keep the UK united and in the EU. When we go to the polls in a General Election, we will be clear: vote Liberal Democrat to stop Brexit.", "description": "Liberal Democrats have been fighting to stop Brexit for more than three years.
