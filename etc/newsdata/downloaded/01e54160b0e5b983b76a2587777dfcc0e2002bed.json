I told her I thought they were good, but also necessary \u2014 particularly because no one else is brave enough to stand up to China. She bemoaned how China has bought up Cambodia and fears it will do the same to her native Thailand.\n\nThis is par for the proverbial course with China. Its ruthless practices abroad have (rightly) received fresh scrutiny as the Trump administration cites it as one reason for its escalating tariffs \u2014 particularly with regards to Beijing\u2019s years-long abuse of intellectual property rights.\n\nThe administration is right to confront China\u2019s tormenting of American industry. A recent survey found that one in five North American-based corporations has been the victim of Chinese theft of intellectual property.\n\nDespite the administration\u2019s efforts to clamp down on Chinese malfeasance, there is still a long way to go. In fact, just as China continues to steal American intellectual property, the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei began demanding that Verizon pay licensing fees for use of over 200 patents.\n\nNauseating hypocrisy aside, Verizon isn\u2019t even one of Huawei\u2019s customers. Perhaps because of the financial strain the U.S. moratorium has placed on Huawei over national security concerns with its technology, Huawei seems to have opted for brazen shakedowns to recoup its losses.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret China and its companies have exploited our IP system for financial gain. What also is no secret is the information that some American companies are passing off as trade secrets in an attempt to reap massive, undeserved profits.\n\nHouseCanary, a Silicon Valley-based real estate technology startup, struck an enormous $740 million judgment after alleging that its customer misappropriated trade secrets. The judgment, which makes HouseCanary\u2019s entire venture funding of $64 million look like pennies, was the largest IP jury verdict in 2018.\n\nHouseCanary seemed to be flying high until numerous former executives at the company whistle-blew that the startup was a fraud that lacked any legitimate intellectual property.\n\nCompany insiders have lined up to say HouseCanary \u201cnever had any proprietary anything\u201d and sold \u201cwire frames and apps that didn\u2019t function\u201d to unsuspecting clients. The whistleblowers noted that HouseCanary\u2019s products did not work \u201csufficiently at a level to be viable in the marketplace.\u201d With little to no revenue from sales, HouseCanary discovered the intellectual property system to be a lucrative alternative for quickly increasing its cash flow.\n\nAdding to the peculiarity of HouseCanary\u2019s trade secret litigation is the fact that the startup exposed its supposed secrets to the public domain, making them by definition not a trade secret. HouseCanary discussed, displayed and admitted into evidence the very information that it claims to be its \u201cmost sensitive information.\u201d The startup sought court-ordered secrecy to undo its own public disclosure, but in July a court ordered the information to be unsealed.\n\nAn appeals court is reviewing HouseCanary\u2019s outlier jackpot. But if struggling companies observe that bogus intellectual property could be the golden ticket to otherwise unobtainable revenue, then expect far more Chinese-style abuse to infiltrate American intellectual property law, the system that has enabled the last 200 years of life-saving, life-improving technological innovation.\n\nYears of experience have conditioned American officials and entrepreneurs to expect China to assail U.S. companies. But HouseCanary shows that American companies too can extract money from industrious producers when competing in the market fails to deliver.\n\nTheoretically, the court system should be capable of recognizing spurious trade secret claims. When the owners of a dance studio tried exploiting trade secret protections by suing dancers who allegedly misappropriated their \u201cideas and concepts for dance productions, marketing strategies and tactics, as well as \u2026 customer lists [containing] contact information,\u201d the North Carolina Supreme Court rightly rejected the premise that these qualified as trade secrets. At the very least, the court demanded specificity to the trade secret claims and not sweeping generalities about well-known concepts.\n\nUnfortunately, the court system is not able to stop every swindler\u2019s unserious trade secret claim. And when it doesn\u2019t, the damage can be measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nIt\u2019s vital for policymakers to explore not only how to prevent intellectual property abuse by foreign actors, but by domestic rent-seekers as well. Our IP system needs to stay the envy of the world, not a place where trolls air out their dirty laundry.\n\n\u2022 Jared Whitley has worked in the U.S Senate, the White House and the defense industry.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
