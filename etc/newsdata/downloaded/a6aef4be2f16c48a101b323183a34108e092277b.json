Then came Donald Trump with promises to restore the greatness of American steel.\n\n\u201cThe only time in my life I\u2019ve ever been out of a job was under Obama,\u201d said Mr. Pechonick, 51 years old, recalling a stretch in 2009-10 when the mine closed due to the poor economy. In 2016, he joined a sizable number of union workers, particularly white men, who voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cSomebody needed to shake up the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe shift helped Mr. Trump win Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, states with strong union traditions, and has put Minnesota\u2014which he lost narrowly three years ago\u2014into possible contention in 2020. The president\u2019s appeal to builders, electricians, plumbers, roofers and miners has alarmed labor leaders, who are now scrambling to prevent further erosion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a serious problem for us,\u201d said Alan Netland, president of the North East Area Labor Council in Duluth, Minn., which represents 40,000 union members. \u201cPeople may say, \u2018I voted Republican and the world didn\u2019t fall in, so maybe I better keep doing that.\u2019\u201d\n\nUnion officials, along with Democratic presidential candidates, are now trying to highlight what they see as a yawning gap between the president\u2019s pro-worker rhetoric and his policies.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s campaign points to the strong economy and steps he has taken to protect American jobs, including tearing up global trade deals, levying tariffs on foreign steel and clearing away environmental obstacles for mining and other industries. It plans to launch a grass-roots labor coalition in which pro-Trump union members would seek to recruit fellow workers to support the president.\n\nMr. Trump as a candidate sold himself as a friend to labor, blasting the North American Free Trade Agreement and pressing an \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda focused on returning manufacturing jobs lost to Mexico and China.\n\nAs a result, Mr. Trump did better among union members than any Republican since Ronald Reagan.\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton commanded the overall labor vote partly due to strength among public sector unions, which account for nearly half of union members, her numbers were down about 10 percentage points from President Barack Obama \u2019s in 2012. Mr. Trump\u2019s stance on immigration and guns resonated with those voters and now, his campaign is counting on an increasingly liberal Democratic Party to turn off more.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What case do you think each party should make to rank-and-file union voters in 2020? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve gone so far left,\u201d said Mr. Pechonick, who was having a beer at the Sawmill Saloon, a hangout for miners, said of Democrats. Still, Mr. Pechonick is waiting to see which Democratic candidate emerges, noting he felt the tax bill the president signed into law favored the wealthy.\n\nUnion leaders and Democrats see an opening. Mr. Trump, they point out, hasn\u2019t delivered on his promise to push a massive job-creating infrastructure package and his administration has scaled back overtime and other worker protections. Last week, the president nominated Eugene Scalia, a former corporate lawyer who has battled unions, to be the next Labor Department secretary.\n\nDemocratic candidates have put appeals to working-class voters at the front of their campaigns. \u201cI am a union man,\u201d declared former Vice President Joe Biden, who leads in 2020 primary polls, during his campaign kickoff in Pennsylvania in May.\n\nThe president was paying attention. He unleashed a wave of tweets as Mr. Biden collected an endorsement from the national firefighters\u2019 union. \u201cI\u2019ve done more for Firefighters than this dues sucking union will ever do, and I get paid ZERO!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. During a recent speech at a petrochemical plant in Pennsylvania, he urged rank-and-file union members to take action against leaders who continue to press them to back Democrats. \u201cVote them the hell out of office,\u201d he said.\n\nJim Pechonick, 51, voted for Donald Trump in 2016, reflecting the trend among Northern Minnesota union members moving away from the Democratic Party.

Wisconsin, which Mr. Trump won by about 23,000 votes, lost 176,000 union members from 2008-2016, according to his research. The trend was similar in Pennsylvania and Michigan.\n\nUnion membership has declined nationally for decades as manufacturing jobs waned and outsourcing grew, in addition to other factors.\n\nThe concern seen in Minnesota was apparent in Erie County, Pa., a blue-collar stronghold since the 1980s that was one of several counties in the state that flipped for Mr. Trump. \u201cHe won the presidency here. I am determined to change that,\u201d said Bill McLaughlin, business manager of the local chapter of the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America.\n\nOn a recent day, Mr. McLaughlin talked to three laborers in bright yellow shirts smoking on their break at a construction site. Two men said they had voted for Mrs. Clinton, and the third said he didn\u2019t vote. Mr. McLaughlin started his pitch anyway. He said if a rule change to apprenticeship programs proposed by the U.S. Labor Department goes through, union laborers in Erie could see their wages and benefits cut to $17 an hour from more than $40 an hour. \u201cI hope you have some very strong feelings about the election,\u201d he said.\n\nAcross the city, Scott Johnson, business manager of Local 210 of the United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers, said he thinks about 50% of the local supports the president. Mr. Johnson said he finds many of Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets offensive and thinks the president gets too much credit for the economy. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get any of the members that are for him to even see that that\u2019s not even 100% the case, but they\u2019ll say Obama tanked the economy and killed the jobs,\u201d he said.\n\nWorking a few feet away in the same office at the union hall was Ted Lunger, who worked for 15 years as a roofer and is a huge Trump supporter. He said he likes the president\u2019s stands on immigration and the Second Amendment and finds the tweets and spats with Democrats entertaining. More than half the members of the union would vote for Mr. Trump, he predicted. \u201cI just think he\u2019s good for the economy.\u201d\n\nSteve Bonach, president of the United Steelworkers Local Union 1938 in Virginia, Minn., says a lot of the union members backed Donald Trump in 2016 despite longstanding Democratic allegiance.

Rick Bloomingdale, president of the state federation of the AFL-CIO, said the president will hold on to socially conservative members concerned about abortion and gun rights. \u201cWe just have to convince 44,000 or 30,000 people that voted for Trump last time to vote for someone else.\u201d\n\nSome union members who backed the president in 2016 are rethinking their votes, Mr. Bloomingdale said. \u201cIn some areas where Trump did well there\u2019s been some disillusionment, but not totally. They\u2019re not convinced the Democrats are there yet either. They\u2019re waiting to hear what the candidates are going to say about the economy.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have made that a central focus of their campaign, pressing that they aren\u2019t taking union votes for granted. Many candidates, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, have joined workers on the picket lines.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont released a plan last month intended to double union membership and he, and others, tweaked his Medicare for All plan based on concerns from some union members that a government plan would be less generous than their union benefits.\n\nSome officials with industrial unions say they\u2019re dissatisfied with Mr. Trump\u2019s challengers so far. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough to get our members to vote for a Democrat,\u201d said Chuck Knissel, a vice president with the United Mine Workers of America in Uniontown, Pa., 45 miles south of Pittsburgh.\n\nMr. Knissel, a Democrat who said he doesn\u2019t support Mr. Trump, said he wanted to throw up watching a recent Democratic debate as candidates all said they want to end the use of coal. He credits Mr. Trump with successfully targeting working class voters. \u201cWhat he did to get elected was genius,\u201d said Mr. Knissel.\n\n\u201cHe took the working-class people out of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\n\u2014Eliza Collins contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Alex Leary at alex.leary@wsj.com and Kris Maher at kris.maher@wsj.com", "description": "President Trump won in 2016 in part by peeling off rank-and-file union members.
