The combined market share in the global battery pouch market of the two Japanese companies is about 70%, according to industry tracker SNE Research.\n\n\u201cI expect we wouldn\u2019t have any issues with those Japanese suppliers if they follow the compliance rules, but we are in the situation where the Japanese government could say different things if they wanted,\u201d Kim added.\n\nChanging suppliers will not be easy, however, as it will take quite some time for LG Chem to run a series of tests and discuss the matter with clients, said an industry source with knowledge of the matter.\n\nLG Chem\u2019s comments came as the South Korean government said on Wednesday it would invest more than 5 trillion won ($4.12 billion) in research and development for local materials, parts and equipment between 2020 and 2022.", "description": "South Korea's LG Chem Ltd is pushing for the localization of some battery parts in an effort to reduce its dependence on Japan amid a deepening political and economic feud, its president said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
