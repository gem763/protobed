The Testaments is the sequel to Atwood\u2019s 1985 dystopian novel.\n\nShowing solidarity in turn by wearing the protest group\u2019s hourglass symbol, the veteran author said environmental crises will affect lives within a generation and has supported international calls for action.\n\nProtestors outside Mansion House in the City of London, during an XR climate change protest, in attire close to that found in Atwood\u00b4s work.

I\u2019m very happy to see them show up after all these years.\n\n\u201cBecause the biologists and people in the environmental field have been saying this for a very long time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely pleasing to see these young people taking hold of that, understanding it, and pointing out that if people don\u2019t fix this particular crisis, stuff like book prizes are going to become very very irrelevant, very quickly.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t even a question of your grandchildren, it\u2019s quite a distance away, it\u2019s not even your children. It\u2019s going to be you.\u201d\n\nAtwood was named the joint winner of the 2019 Booker Prize along with British author Bernardine Evaristo, who explored the lives of black women in her work Girl, Woman, Other.\n\nThe splitting of the prize represented a rebellion from judges, headed by Hay Festival founder Peter Florence, who broke the rules to divide the \u00a350,000 award.\n\nEvaristo has become the first black woman to be honoured with the Booker, and the judges\u2019 decision thrust two female authors and their articulation of female struggles to the fore.\n\nAtwood believes that while women may be afforded literary prizes, they are not extended the same privileges in wider society.\n\nShe said: \u201cFor women writers the chances are a lot better than they used to be.\n\n\u201cFor women women, it depends where you are in the world, and it also depends where you are in the hierarchy within that part of the world.\n\n\u201cObviously in places that chaotic and war-torn the chances are very bad. And for people at the lower end of the social scale they are getting worse, because the income gap is getting greater.\u201d\n\nThe prolific author of more than 40 works, who began as a poet in the 1960s, Atwood believes her own fiction will inevitably reflect her social context and concerns, which has lead her to be popular symbolically within protest groups.\n\nShe said: \u201cI think it\u2019s circular. Art reflects life.\n\n\u201cNo matter what you write, even if you\u2019re writing about medieval Europe, you\u2019re still writing in your own time.\n\n\u201cPeople see that reflection and they may pick up on it, but things come from reality first.\u201d\n\nAtwood said she did not need the money or attention of the Booker, and would be donating her \u00a325,000 prize.", "description": "The Handmaid\u00b4s Tale author has backed the work of Extinction Rebellion.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/13/wire-19740350-1571143431-311_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
