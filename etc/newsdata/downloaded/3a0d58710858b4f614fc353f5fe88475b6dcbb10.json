ETH price might continue to face hurdles near $175 and $180.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nThis past week, we saw a strong decline in Ethereum below the $185 support against the US Dollar. ETH price even settled below the $175 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. A new monthly low was formed near $152 before the price started trading in a range. The bears made two attempts to break the $152 and $150 support levels, but they failed to gain momentum.\n\nRecently, there was an upside correction above the $160 and $165 levels. Moreover, the price climbed above the $172 resistance level. However, the price struggled to gain momentum above the $175 level and the 100 hourly SMA. A high was formed near $177 and the price is currently correcting lower. It broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $152 low to $177 high.\n\nHowever, the $165 level is acting as a decent support for Ethereum. Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $152 low to $177 high is acting as a support. More importantly, there is likely a flag pattern forming with resistance near $171 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, there are key resistances near $175, $177 and $180.\n\nIf there is an upside break above $180, the price could recover towards the $185 resistance area (the previous support). Conversely, a break below the $165 support might push the price further lower. The next key support is near the $162 level, below which the price could accelerate lower towards the $155 level.\n\nLooking at the chart, Ethereum price is showing a few signs of a corrective increase above $170. However, the price must clear the $175 and $180 resistance levels to continue higher. Having said that, the main hurdle for the bulls is near the $185 level.\n\nETH Technical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is slowly moving back into the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now well below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $162\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $175", "description": "Ethereum price is trading in a broad range after this past week\u2019s decline versus the US Dollar and bitcoin.
