The total deal could eventually come to \u00a326 million on appearances at club level, which will be a transfer record for Villa.\n\nHowever, the deal still represents outstanding value for the Midlands club with the initial \u00a321 million price a quarter of the fee paid by Manchester United for Harry Maguire.", "description": "Aston Villa will pay an extra \u00a3250,000 to Bournemouth after Tyrone Mings made his England debut.", "authors": ["John Percy", "Jason Burt", "Sam Wallace", "Keith Hackett"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/15/TELEMMGLPICT000211287588-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqk27orzPKVvG5ACB4HPucmhJjhSAiLoOs2YBqTJwRzmw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
