Jeanne Shaheen.\n\n\u201cIn a Trump-dominated Republican Party, the only thing better than having the last name of Trump would be having the last name of Lewandowski,\u201d said Neil Levesque, executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College.\n\nDuring a break in his contentious hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Lewandowski tweeted out the link to a new website aimed at boosting his Senate hopes. It prominently features a Mr. Trump quote praising Mr. Lewandowski.\n\nNew website just launched to help a potential senate run. Sign up now! https://t.co/WlI11PaQ7M \u2014 Corey R. Lewandowski (@CLewandowski_) September 17, 2019\n\nMichael Dennehy, a New Hampshire-based Republican strategist, said Mr. Lewandowski \u201ctruly is a mini-me of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nMr. Lewandowski was back in the middle of the political action Tuesday on Capitol Hill, where he testified before the House Judiciary Committee over potential obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump.\n\nThe showdown between Mr. Lewandowski and congressional Democrats provided the pugnacious 45-year-old with a massive stage to flash the trademark swagger and brash and bombastic style that \u2014 much like Mr. Trump \u2014 has made him among the most polarizing of political figures.\n\nFormer New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg drove home that point last month when he told the Manchester Union Leader, the state\u2019s largest newspaper, that Mr. Lewandowski is a \u201cthug\u201d and said it would be an \u201coutrage\u201d if he runs.\n\n\u201cCorey has both strong supporters and detractors here in New Hampshire,\u201d said Stephen Duprey, a member of the Republican National Committee from New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cIf he were to get into the race with the president\u2019s support, he would be very difficult to beat in a primary and he would be a formidable opponent for Sen. Shaheen,\u201d he said.\n\nEarly polls have shown that Mr. Lewandowki would enter the GOP primary race with a double-digit lead over his rivals: Brigadier General Don Bolduc, former state House Speaker Bill O\u2019Brien, and Bryant \u201cCorky\u201d Messner.\n\nMr. Lewandowski has been test driving a possible campaign message: casting Ms. Shaheen as a radical liberal and weak on immigration and attacking her for opposing Mr. Trump\u2019s Supreme court picks.\n\nHe also is touting his connections with the White House and his fundraising prowess.\n\nBut whether he runs or not, Mrs. Shaheen still is favored to win re-election.\n\nThe 72-year-old showed her political strength in 2014 when she won re-election even as Republicans flipped control of the Senate.\n\nPolls show she has a double-digit lead over Mr. Lewandowski in a hypothetical match-up and had over $5 million in the bank at the end of June.\n\nMr. Lewandowski, though, is likely to have a secret weapon in Mr. Trump, who praised him at a New Hampshire rally last month, saying he would make a \u201cfantastic\u201d senator.\n\nOther Republicans shutter at the prospect.\n\n\u201cCorey is unfit for public office,\u201d said former New Hampshire GOP Chairman Fergus Cullen.\n\nMr. Cullen said he doesn\u2019t understand why Mr. Lewandowski would want to risk denting his image in a high-profile Senate race.\n\n\u201cWhy would he put that gravy train at risk by running for Senate?\u201d he said. \u201cHe is cashing in right now.\u201d\n\nMr. Dennehy said it is clear the Republican establishment believes Mr. Lewandowski has no place in electoral politics, while allies of New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu are concerned that he could be a drag on the state\u2019s entire GOP ticket. (Mr. Sununu\u2019s older brother, John E. Sununu, held the Senate seat until Mrs. Shaheen defeated him in 2008.)\n\n\u201cThen there are those who believe that Lewandowski could actually help the Republican ticket if he is the nominee by bringing more money into the state for Republicans, and contrasting himself to Shaheen in a way that has never been done before,\u201d Mr. Dennehy said.\n\nMr. Dennehy said he\u2019s warming to the idea of Mr. Lewandowski running, saying he could raise an \u201cobscene\u201d amount of money through his ties to Mr. Trump and likely would take the fight to Mrs. Shaheen in ways that others might consider off limits.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s first victory in the 2016 Republican presidential primary came in New Hampshire.\n\nDemocrat Hillary Clinton, however, won the state in the general election, and polls show the president\u2019s job approval rating is underwater in the state.\n\nRaymond Buckley, chairman of the New Hampshire Democrats, said Mr. Lewandowski is another Republican who is wrong on the issues.\n\n\u201cLewandowski is distinguished only because he has spent the past three years in Washington selling access to the White House to bad actors, including foreign interests,\u201d Mr. Buckley said. \u201cThat\u2019s why New Hampshire Republicans are doing everything they can to stop him from running, and his primary opponents are calling him out for being a Washington lobbyist.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
