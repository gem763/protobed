The Packers are a run-funnel defense with a DVOA that ranks fifth against the pass but 26th versus the rush, and Jacobs is a contrarian DFS play as a back on a team entering as underdogs ... If you\u2019re looking for a deep sleeper at tight end, grab Foster Moreau, who was an intriguing dynasty add even before Darren Waller was a late-week addition to the injury report.\n\nThe Packers receiving corps is a mess with Davante Adams and Geronimo Allison unlikely to suit up and with Marquez Valdes-Scantling playing compromised at best (and Jimmy Graham looking ready to retire while getting a paltry 0.95 yards per route run). Enter Allen Lazard, who seemingly earned some of Aaron Rodgers\u2019 trust with a TD grab late in last week\u2019s comeback win and could easily lead the Packers in targets Sunday against a pass-funnel Oakland defense. Lazard remains available in more than two-thirds of Yahoo leagues.\n\nArizona Cardinals @ New York Giants\n\nStart in DFS: Kyler Murray ($30)\n\nStart: Daniel Jones\n\nThe Giants defend the run well enough but are a sieve against the pass, so this game sets up favorably for Murray. He\u2019s somewhat quietly been the QB7 in fantasy this year despite a modest seven TD passes, and the rookie is only going to get better. The Giants have ceded the fifth-most fantasy points to QBs this season.\n\nStory continues\n\n[Play in Yahoo\u2019s NFL $250K Baller. $10 entry fee and $25K to first place]\n\nJones is also worth a start in a battle of rookie quarterbacks, with his team favored in a matchup with one of the highest totals (50.5 points) of the week. Both teams rank top-10 in Pace, and Jones is going to get back reinforcements in Evan Engram and Saquon Barkley. After facing the Vikings and Patriots, Jones will find life much easier against an Arizona defense that\u2019s allowed a 16:0 TD:INT ratio and the most fantasy points to quarterbacks this season (although Patrick Peterson returns from suspension).\n\nHouston Texans @ Indianapolis Colts\n\nStart in DFS: TY Hilton ($29), Will Fuller ($21)\n\nHilton should be closer to 100% coming off a bye, and he gets Jonathan Joseph and company this week, who\u2019ve allowed the second-most fantasy points to his primary side this season. Hilton has averaged 103.2 receiving yards over 14 career games against Houston.\n\nFuller is having the craziest up-and-down campaign in the league, following a massive three-touchdown game in Week 5 (he was two yards away from scoring five that day) to dropping three would-be scores last week. He\u2019s second in the NFL in air yards, and DeAndre Hopkins just doesn\u2019t look the same right now, so I\u2019m treating Fuller as a top-10 WR in Week 7.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars @ Cincinnati Bengals\n\nStart: Gardner Minshew, Auden Tate\n\nMinshew fell back to earth last week against a New Orleans defense that\u2019s been defending QBs well lately, but he should bounce back against a Bengals secondary that\u2019s ceded the sixth-most fantasy points to quarterbacks this year and is now missing its top two corners thanks to injuries.\n\nOver the last four weeks, Tate ranks top-25 in air yards and has a higher WOPR than DeAndre Hopkins and Julio Jones. He faces a Jacksonville secondary sans Jalen Ramsey that\u2019s been stingier against the slot this season than the perimeter, so don\u2019t be surprised when Tate outperforms teammate Tyler Boyd again Sunday.\n\nLos Angeles Rams @ Atlanta Falcons\n\nStart: Jared Goff, Calvin Ridley\n\nGoff hasn\u2019t been a QB1 in fantasy so far this year, even scoring fewer points than Gardner Minshew, and he typically doesn\u2019t play as well on the road. But last week\u2019s dud can be partially excused by a dominant SF defense, and he gets the opposite this week, as Atlanta ranks 31st in pass defense DVOA (seventh against the run) while allowing a 15:2 TD:INT ratio this season. This game features the highest total of the week (55 points), and I have Goff as a top-three QB in this matchup. I also have Cooper Kupp as the WR1 and Robert Woods as a top-10 WR this week (and make sure Darrell Henderson is rostered in your league).\n\nThe Rams have allowed the fourth-most fantasy points to Ridley\u2019s primary side this season, and if Jalen Ramsey plays, he\u2019s likely to follow Julio Jones around plenty. Like Atlanta, Los Angeles is much better against the run (fifth in DVOA) than the pass (20th), so this is set up for a ton of scoring via the air Sunday.\n\nRidley could be the focal point of Atlanta's attack on Sunday.

Deebo Samuel is banged up and looks unlikely to play this week, so Pettis should see increased targets against a Washington secondary that\u2019s yielded the fifth-most fantasy points to wide receivers this season.\n\nTerry McLaurin is admittedly tough to sit at this point, but he\u2019s the only Washington player even worth considering using in fantasy lineups against a San Francisco defense that sports the league\u2019s highest 3&Out% and is on pace to allow the fewest passing yards since 1982. The 49ers have shut down some of the league\u2019s best wide receivers this season, thanks in no small part to Nick Bosa easily leading the NFL in pressure rate.\n\nMiami Dolphins @ Buffalo Bills\n\nSit: All Dolphins\n\nStart: Frank Gore\n\nMaybe Ryan Fitzpatrick injects some life into Miami\u2019s offense, but they have a tough task traveling to Buffalo to face the Bills coming off a bye. Few teams are stingier against wide receivers than Buffalo, who come in ranked No. 3 in defense DVOA.\n\nSpeaking of defense DVOA, the Dolphins enter ranked last, and the game script figures to call for plenty of Gore runs (revenge game!) with the Bills 17-point home favorites. Devin Singletary and Duke Williams (sleeper alert) are two other fliers worth using in deeper formats this week.\n\nMinnesota Vikings @ Detroit Lions\n\nSit: Kirk Cousins\n\nStart: Marvin Jones\n\nCousins is coming off a monstrous game, but he should return to being mostly a caretaker without a ton of volume Sunday against a Lions defense that hasn\u2019t been especially friendly to quarterbacks.\n\nJones has been quiet lately but remains Detroit\u2019s clear WR2 and gets a Minnesota defense that\u2019s strong against the run while allowing the fewest fantasy points to the slot. Moreover, Xavier Rhodes will be all over Kenny Golladay, so Jones should be busier than usual Sunday.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers @ Tennessee Titans\n\nStart: Mike Williams\n\nSit: Corey Davis\n\nThe Titans have quieted most receivers this season except for those on Williams\u2019 primary side (where they\u2019ve ceded the sixth-most fantasy points), and he should see a lot of Malcolm Butler on Sunday. Few players are due for more regression than Williams, who, after recording 10 scores on just 66 looks as a rookie, somehow has zero TDs this year despite being tied for the second-most targets inside the 5-yard line and ranking top-12 in air yards (no other receiver in the top-25 is without a score this year). Williams is due to explode, and you\u2019ll want him in your lineup when he does.\n\nDavis has been outshined by rookie teammate A.J. Brown this season and is likely to be shadowed this week by Casey Hayward on a Chargers defense that\u2019s limited outside receivers to the second-fewest fantasy points over the last month.\n\nBaltimore Ravens @ Seattle Seahawks\n\nStart in DFS: Mark Andrews ($22)\n\nStart: DK Metcalf\n\nAndrews should be locked into fantasy lineups as one of the few bright spots among tight ends, and he\u2019s an especially intriguing DFS start this week with Marquise Brown still hobbled and in a projected high-scoring game (48.5 points) against a Seattle defense that\u2019s been among the most vulnerable to fantasy tight ends lately (and with Travis Kelce not playing during the main slate).\n\nMetcalf remains among the league leaders in end-zone targets and should immediately see a bunch of newcomer Marcus Peters, who\u2019s struggled in coverage this season. There should be a lot of points scored in this game, and with Marlon Humphrey assigned to Tyler Lockett and Will Dissly out, Metcalf should be busier than usual.\n\nNew Orleans Saints @ Chicago Bears\n\nStart: Latavius Murray, Anthony Miller\n\nAlvin Kamara has been officially ruled out of Week 7\u2019s tilt against the Bears. It\u2019s not an easy matchup in Chicago, but New Orleans enters with arguably an advantage up front, and Murray is capable of handling a big workload on a team that will want to hide its backup QB in a harsh environment. Treat him as a top-15 RB with Kamara sidelined.\n\nMiller ditched his shoulder harness over the bye and appears ready to cut loose against a Saints defense that\u2019s been gashed for the second-most fantasy points to the slot over the last month (Patrick Robinson will be replacing a suspended P.J. Williams in this game).\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles @ Dallas Cowboys\n\nStart: Jordan Howard, Devin Smith\n\nHoward had scored five touchdowns over his previous three games before being held out of the end zone last week, and he\u2019ll enter Sunday night\u2019s contest with a big advantage running behind Philly\u2019s offensive line. The Cowboys\u2019 3-0 start came against teams with a collective 3-14 record, and they enter dealing with injuries while being quite vulnerable against the run. Don\u2019t be surprised if Dallas has a new coach next week.\n\nMichael Gallup is the No. 2 wide receiver on my board this week and is a strong DFS ($26) start, while Smith is an upside flier for those in deeper leagues. Smith could start and see plenty of targets Sunday night with Amari Cooper and Randall Cobb banged up against a Philadelphia defense that\u2019s stout against the run (No. 2 in DVOA), yet one that sports an injury-riddled secondary that\u2019s routinely shredded.\n\nNew England Patriots @ New York Jets\n\nStart: Ben Watson\n\nSit: Robby Anderson\n\nThe TE position gets thin quick, especially with four teams on bye (mercifully, I\u2019m forced to sit O.J. Howard), and the Pats re-signed Watson, who immediately becomes the team\u2019s best receiving tight end. With Josh Gordon and Phillip Dorsett both hobbled on an offense missing playmakers, Watson could immediately make an impact at fantasy\u2019s weakest position.\n\nAnderson put up a nice game last week despite a tough matchup thanks to a 92-yard catch, but he gets yet another difficult assignment Monday night versus Stephon Gilmore and a New England defense that\u2019s given up the fewest fantasy points to outside receivers this season. Anderson is about to go on a nice stretch against favorable pass defenses after opening the year with an epic run facing the league\u2019s best shutdown corners, and Sam Darnold\u2019s return is huge, so he\u2019ll be someone to attempt to buy low on after Monday night.\n\nFollow the Yahoo fantasy football crew on Twitter: Andy Behrens, Dalton Del Don, Brad Evans, Matt Harmon, Liz Loza, Scott Pianowski and Tank Williams\n\nListen to the Yahoo Fantasy Football Podcast", "description": "Dalton Del Don delivers his sit-start advice for Week 7, and he likes Calvin Ridley ahead of a high-scoring affair vs. the Rams.", "authors": ["Dalton Del Don"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eZC26trJ3Utn8De7RZzVzA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/52A08jngbAmGedVEVvET9Q--~B/aD0zMzkwO3c9NTA4NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/bc0968f0-f1c7-11e9-bedf-de9ecc04b8de", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
