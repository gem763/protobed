NASA\u2019s spacesuits are not differentiated by sex but female astronauts tend to require smaller sizes than their male counterparts and only one medium sized suit was available when the walk was originally set to take place.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018PR disaster\u2019: NASA ditches historic all-female spacewalk after spacesuits won\u2019t fit\n\nThe International Space Station generates power using solar panels but batteries are required when the space lab is in the dark and not receiving any sunlight. The all-female walk will be the fourth of five upcoming spacewalks involving battery work. The first is this Sunday, when Koch will venture out with a male colleague.\n\nSince she was denied the opportunity to take part in the first all-female spacewalk, McClain has found herself at the center of extraordinary accusations that she carried out the first crime in space by hacking her ex-spouse\u2019s bank account while on board the ISS. She has denied the accusations and remains an active astronaut.\n\nAlso on rt.com NASA astronaut accused of hacking ex-spouse\u2019s bank account from space\n\nLike this story?
