Even churches and schools, safe spaces are lost We\u2019ve become generation lockdown\n\nI was in first grade when the Sandy Hook school shooting happened. That day 27 young lives were taken\n\nThat week my school put up an iron gate. As our parents dropped us off we\u2019d say goodbye through thick crimson bars that looked like a jail cell door\n\nThat week parents all over America were reminded that life is a short as a moth's wing, and fear as commonplace as dishes in the sink.\n\nFebruary 14th, 2018, I am in sixth grade when Valentines was not the same Our hearts were broken that day when 17 students in Parkland lost their lives to senseless gun violence\n\nThat year we marched for our lives. That week our school got a full-time armed security guard.\n\nAmerica never gets to heal when our wounds reopen again and again There have been more mass shootings in 2019 than there have been days this year.", "description": "", "authors": ["Art", "Development Alberto Mier", "Will Houp"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/09/05/lockdown.gif"}
