The journey so far: Tividale 2 Wednesfield 1 Tividale 0 Chasetown 5 Chasetown 1 Staveley MW 0 Leamington 2 Chasetown 2 Chasetown 1 Leamington 2 (aet) Leamington 0 Darlington 2 Journey to Wembley, a similar chronicle of the 1976-77 competition by Sportsmail\u2019s Brian James, also began at Tividale\u2026\n\nThe accompanying reports describing him as \u2018the ex-Darlington chairman\u2019 went down very badly indeed. \u2018It was years ago but they\u2019re still associating him with us,\u2019 says one of the 50 or so fans who have made the 180-mile journey to Leamington\u2019s modest, immaculate stadium.\n\nDarlington went into administration twice more before they were relegated four divisions on the FA\u2019s recommendation and started again in 2012 under fan ownership in the Northern League, sharing Bishop Auckland\u2019s ground.\n\nAfter three consecutive promotions, the Quakers have struggled to get beyond the sixth-tier National League North.\n\nTheir \u00a3300,000 annual playing budget \u2014 including 40-week contracts for most of their players \u2014 is nearly double that of Leamington, who have just a handful on contracts, but that kind of differential means little here. Darlo are a point behind the home team \u2014 another phoenix club \u2014 in the league.\n\n\u2018You need more than money to succeed where we are,\u2019 says John Vickerman, adviser to the Darlington board in a club run top to bottom by volunteers.\n\nLeamington\u2019s little press box provides a graphic sense of the multiple sorrows that Bury will be experiencing when they re-form. Ray Simpson, who handles Darlington\u2019s media liaison, is reporting on the game for BBC radio and the North East papers. Both sent their own staff in the days before the fall from grace.\n\nThe field of play tells a story of diminishment, too. Darlo look every bit the struggling side, incapable of holding possession or securing a foothold as Paul Holleran\u2019s Leamington deploy target men Josh March and Jack Edwards to great effect, with Kaiman Anderson an effective provider.\n\nThere is \u00a311,250 prize-money for the winners and the Brakes \u2014Leamington are a one-time automotive parts factory team \u2014 seem more absorbed with the FA Cup third qualifying round than the visitors. Groundsman Idris Elms doesn\u2019t mind saying that his surface \u2014 tricky to maintain because of the Warwickshire blue clay beneath \u2014 would be good enough for Manchester City, should such an encounter come to pass.\n\nIn this world of tight margins, everyone\u2019s looking for the lucky break: the unspotted player who can instigate a Cup run. Holleran has a knack of finding them and in many cases reviving their lost self-belief, as Reece Flanagan, his outstanding No 8, demonstrates in the first 45 minutes. He\u2019s dropped down three divisions from Walsall to be on loan here.\n\nDarlington manager Alun Armstrong has Tyrone O\u2019Neill, a thin strip of a striker who turned 20 last week. He didn\u2019t know what hit him when he first arrived on a six-month loan from Middlesbrough in July and struggles as much as anyone in his team\u2019s poor first half. But on 64 minutes, his class tells. O\u2019Neill takes a ball from Adam Campbell on his chest, swivels and shoots right-footed with minimal back-lift, burying the ball in the bottom left hand corner of the net.\n\nIt\u2019s a stinging blow to a home side who immediately bring two saves of the highest order from Darlington\u2019s Liam Connell. But William Hatfield, anchoring midfield, steadies Darlington, who score again. O\u2019Neill initiates a move which sees the ball navigated through Jarrett Rivers to substitute Justin Donawa, who is travelling away from goal when he angles a shot back under Jack Weaver.\n\nDonawa is one of two Bermudan internationals on Darlington\u2019s books. One of the club\u2019s directors has a link to that country. \u2018Connections,\u2019 says Vickerman after the final whistle sounds. \u2018They can make all the difference.\u2019\n\nThe sizeable crowd of 605 demonstrates that Leamington had felt this might just be their year. But Darlington leave with the aspirations.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve no major investor, which is fine after all we\u2019ve been through,\u2019 says Chris Stockdale, chairman of the club\u2019s supporters group. \u2018So a Cup run would mean so much.\u2019\n\nThey had not won a single qualifying round in seven years under fan ownership before this season. Now they\u2019re looking to bury Reynolds even further into the past.", "description": "IAN HERBERT AT THE PHILLIPS 66 COMMUNITY STADIUM: For those looking to break the ice with a Darlington fan, be aware that the name 'George Reynolds' is a conversational killer.", "authors": ["Ian Herbert For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/19/19367736-0-image-a-61_1570386865747.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
