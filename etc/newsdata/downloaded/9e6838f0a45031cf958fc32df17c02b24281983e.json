In stopping the House of Commons from deliberating about Brexit\u2014or giving the growing number of his parliamentary opponents an opportunity to depose him\u2014Johnson has demonstrated that he considers himself a more legitimate spokesperson for the will of his countrymen than the institution that has been charged with this task for the past three centuries.\n\nIt is the most blatant assault on democracy in Britain\u2019s living memory, and one of the most serious any Western country has faced in this populist era.\n\nRead: Boris Johnson is suspending Parliament. What\u2019s next for Brexit?\n\nFor much of my adult life, I thought of Britain as one of the most stable democracies in the world, if not the most. It\u2019s not just that Britain\u2019s unwritten constitution has been in place for many centuries, or that an adherence to representative democracy lies at the very heart of the country\u2019s self-conception. It\u2019s that Britain has, time and again, managed to mediate explosive political conflicts because its institutions were able to broker a compromise that most of its citizens could, happily or unhappily, put up with.\n\nFrom workers\u2019 rights to an expansion of the franchise, political issues that inspired civil war in many other countries were settled by elected representatives in Parliament. And though, like any other democracy in the world, Britain has of course faced a number of urgent political challenges about which its populace was deeply divided, no single issue seemed capable of upending that long tradition. This very much included its relationship to the rest of Europe: While a strong contingent of so-called euroskeptics opposed Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union, less than 1 percent of respondents named this as the country\u2019s most pressing political issue in a poll taken less than a decade ago.\n\nOver the past three years, however, a revolutionary spirit has taken hold of the country. When euroskeptics within his own party made it difficult for Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron to sustain a parliamentary majority, he set out to \u201clance the boil\u201d by granting them an in-or-out referendum about Britain\u2019s membership in the EU. That\u2019s not what happened, in part because voters proved more willing to use the referendum as a way to express their disapproval of the ruling class than Cameron had anticipated. And since nobody had seriously pondered the consequences of a victory for the Brexiteers, the referendum contained a serious design flaw that has haunted the country ever since: While it was reasonably obvious what it would mean if Britain voted to remain in the European Union, it was unclear what course of action a vote to leave would license.\n\nThe vote set up a conflict between popular and parliamentary sovereignty that is, in this form, unprecedented in British history. On the one hand, there was a clear popular mandate to leave the European Union. \u201cBrexit,\u201d as Cameron\u2019s successor, Theresa May, said a few days after the referendum, \u201cmeans Brexit.\u201d On the other hand, a representative assembly whose members had largely opposed Brexit were tasked with making sense of what Britain\u2019s future relationship with Europe should look like. May\u2019s truism notwithstanding, the question of what Brexit meant in actual, concrete detail soon started to tear the country apart.", "description": "His decision to temporarily suspend Parliament is the most dangerous assault on Britain\u2019s institutions in living memory.", "authors": ["Yascha Mounk", "Contributing Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/AP_19240521101354/facebook.jpg?1567013701"}
