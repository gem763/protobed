Since his death on Saturday, a bitter family battle for control of his body has converted his afterlife into a telenovela.\n\nJos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 \u2013 known as El Pr\u00edncipe de la Canci\u00f3n, or the Prince of Song \u2013 died in Miami on Saturday. He was 71 and was known to have pancreatic cancer.\n\nAt first, things all followed the celebrity death rulebook: tributes rolled in for the legendary entertainer famed for his vocal range, impeccable suits and redemptive struggle with alcohol and cocaine abuse.\n\nSocial media buzzed with footage showing passengers on a Mexico City bus bursting into a spontaneous rendition of his most famous hit, El Triste, or The Sad One.\n\nBut public mourning quickly gave way to fascination with a family feud, stoked by the showbiz media on both sides of the US-Mexico border.\n\nThe singer, whose legal name was Jos\u00e9 R\u00f3mulo Sosa Ortiz, had been living in Miami since February 2018 with Sarita Sosa, his youngest daughter and only child from his third marriage.\n\nJos\u00e9 Joel and Marysol Sosa, his other two children from an earlier marriage, have publicly accused Sarita of kidnapping their father, preventing him from seeing them, and manipulating him into signing over control of his life and legacy.\n\nThe day after the singer\u2019s death, the two elder siblings were filmed pleading with Sarita to tell them where their father\u2019s body was as they visited funeral parlours around Miami, pursued by a swarm of reporters.\n\n\u201cWe have every right to see my father,\u201d Marysol told the Mexican network TV Azteca. \u201cMy half-sister has a lot to explain to me \u2013 and to all of Mexico.\u201d\n\nSarita, meanwhile, gave two studio interviews in which she insisted she had never tried to block her siblings seeing their dad.\n\n\u201cAside from our differences, now is the time to be united,\u201d she told the US network Telemundo. \u201cIf they come out and say something else, that\u2019s a matter for them.\u201d\n\nThe public\u2019s mounting obsession with the story has been further fuelled by mudslinging between prominent showbiz TV presenters accusing each other of taking sides, or paying for exclusives.\n\nPostmortem controversies are not uncommon for Mexico\u2019s most iconic entertainers. After the singer Juan Gabriel died in 2016, rumours spread that he was still alive and that he faked his own death to escape the pressures of his fame.\n\nThe whirlwind around Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 calmed after the Mexican consulate in Miami confirmed that the body was in fact in a funeral parlour under the control of Sarita.\n\nBut it remained unclear if Jos\u00e9 Joel and Marysol had seen their father\u2019s body \u2013 let alone in which country he would finally be buried and who will inherit his estate.", "description": "Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9\u2019s two elder children say their half-sister won\u2019t reveal where the body is, while the showbiz media stokes the feud", "authors": ["Jo Tuckman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbebead3b6258d308f33806281196c2995446a42/0_151_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8e5a76ca62939012bf27cf62cd2466da", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
