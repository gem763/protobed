I just wonder after the events of this week, and the fallout we\u2019ve seen, whether you would both feel differently about speaking out in that way in the future?\u201d asked Macfarlane.\n\nThe Houston Rockets media officer is heard off-camera interjecting that the players are taking \u201cbasketball questions only.\u201d A man is then seen reaching to remove the microphone from the reporter\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate question,\u201d Macfarlane replied. \u201cThis is an event that has happened this week.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand that. It\u2019s a question that\u2019s already been answered,\u201d the team\u2019s press staffer shot back, before reiterating that only basketball questions were allowed.\n\nMacfarlane then prompted Harden to respond before passing back the microphone, though both he and Westbrook refused to acknowledge the question.\n\nOn Monday, Harden, flanked by Westbrook, weighed in on the matter by offering an apology for Morey\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cWe apologize. You know, we love China. We love playing there,\u201d he said. \u201cFor both of us individually, we go there once or twice a year. They show us the most important love.\u201d", "description": "A CNN reporter was\u00a0cut off by a Houston Rockets media officer while asking Houston Rockets stars James Harden and Russell Westbrook about the ongoing free speech furor surrounding China.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/nba-reporter-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
