The chopper plucked those stranded on the second floor of a home submerged in muddy waters.\n\nAerial footage showed tractors at work trying to control the flooding and several people on a rooftop, with one waving white cloth to get the attention of a helicopter. Nearby was a child\u2019s school bag. In another part, rows of Japan\u2019s prized bullet trains, parked in a facility, were sitting in a pool of water.\n\nA stretch of Fukushima, in the city of Date, was also flooded with only rooftops of residential homes visible in some areas, and rescuers paddled in boats to get people out. Parts of nearby Miyagi prefecture were also under water.\n\nThe Tama River, which runs by Tokyo, overflowed its banks, flooding homes and other buildings in the area.\n\nAuthorities warned of a risk of mudslides. Among the reported deaths were those whose homes were buried in landslides. Other fatalities included people who got swept away by raging rivers.\n\nSuga said recovery was on its way. Some 376,000 homes were without electricity, and 14,000 homes lacked running water, he said.\n\nBoats as well as helicopters were sent to the flooded areas, while rescue crew dug through dirt elsewhere to try to get people out from homes buried by landslides.\n\nSeveral train service in the Tokyo area resumed early morning, although others were undergoing safety checks and were expected to restart later Sunday.\n\nRuling party politician Fumio Kishida said the government will do its utmost in rescue operations, including making sure that those who moved to shelters were taken care of.\n\nHe acknowledged Japan\u2019s power grids need to be strengthened so people in disaster areas can rely on timely information.\n\n\u201cSo many risks remain, and it is a reality we must stay on guard,\u201d Kishida said on an NHK TV news talk show. \u201cWe must do our utmost. In these times, a disaster can hit anytime.\u201d\n\nThe Rugby World Cup match between Namibia and Canada, scheduled for Sunday in Kamaishi, northern Japan, was canceled as a precautionary measure, but organizers announced Japan will play Scotland as scheduled Sunday evening. Matches on Saturday had been canceled. Stores and amusement parks had also closed.\n\nAs the typhoon bore down on Saturday with heavy rains and strong winds, the usually crowded train stations and streets of Tokyo were deserted with people advised to stay indoors. But life was quickly returning to normal under crisp clear skies Sunday.\n\nEvacuation centers had been set up in coastal towns with tens of thousands seeking shelter. Kyodo News service said evacuation warnings had been issued to more than 6 million people.\n\nThe typhoon disrupted a three-day weekend in Japan that includes Sports Day on Monday. Qualifying for a Formula One auto race in Suzuka was pushed from Saturday to Sunday.\n\nThe authorities had repeatedly warned Hagibis was on par with a typhoon that hit the Tokyo region in 1958. But the safety infrastructure that Japan\u2019s modernization had brought was apparent. The typhoon six decades ago had left more than 1,200 people dead and half a million houses flooded.\n\n___\n\nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en", "description": "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Helicopters, boats and thousands of troops were deployed across Japan Sunday to rescue people stranded in flooded homes Sunday as the death", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/12/ad3fd6_japan-asia-typhoon-76310-vehicles-are-in-mud-water-as-typhoon-hagibis-hit-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
