The second, Eyad A, has been charged with aiding and abetting a crime against humanity, it was announced on Tuesday.\n\nBoth men entered Germany as asylum seekers, in July 2014 and August 2018 respectively.\n\nGerman authorities have approached the cases under the legal principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows the prosecution of crimes in one country even if they happened elsewhere.\n\nSubstantial evidence against the men was gathered as a result of the exhibition of so-called Caesar photographs in the UN headquarters in New York in March 2015, which depicted the corpses of thousands of torture victims alongside personal testimonies. The photographs were taken by a former member of the Syrian military police calling himself Caesar, who fled Syria with the images in 2013.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Charges \u2013 including 59 counts of murder \u2013 linked to UN exhibition of torture photographs in 2015", "authors": ["Philip Oltermann"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/878ac1bc831365145ed8235a61aedf80369612a4/0_88_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=485d812583a9b9e005b18cf106425444", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
