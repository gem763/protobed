Per Vice, Ring often gets the agencies involved in the marketing of the Amazon security cameras, either directly or indirectly.\n\nConcerns with the deals include everything from a lack of transparency, to the fact that taxpayer money is sometimes used to buy or subsidize devices to the potential for racial profiling and discrimination.\n\nYou can see a map of some of the cities with Ring deals here.\n\nThe big picture: Alliances between law enforcement and tech companies, such as Palantir's contracts with local police departments, have a history of raising hackles, and rising concerns in the U.S. over privacy have put some consumers on edge about tech that tracks their moves.\n\nMeanwhile, authoritarian governments around the world \u2014 from China to the Middle East \u2014 are racing to deploy advanced technology like facial recognition combined with video surveillance to cow dissent.\n\nWhat they're saying:\n\nEvan Greer, deputy director, Fight for the Future: \"Amazon is building a for-profit surveillance empire that completely skirts the democratic process. These partnerships are spreading extremely fast.\"\n\n\"Amazon is building a for-profit surveillance empire that completely skirts the democratic process.
