Col. Alexander Vindman (Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters)\n\nThe National Security Council\u2019s top Ukrainian expert testified to the House on Tuesday that key words and phrases were omitted from the transcript President Trump released of his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe New York Times first reported that Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman mentioned the discrepancies between the call he listened to and the released transcript. According to people familiar with the testimony, Vindman said that the White House omitted a claim by Trump that there were recordings of former vice president Joe Biden discussing Ukraine corruption, as well as an explicit mention by Zelensky of Burisma Holdings \u2014 the energy firm that hired Hunter Biden.\n\nVindman did not posit a motive for the altered transcript, and told the House that he attempted to change the transcript to better reflect the omissions, which was partially successful, but did not include those two corrections.\n\nWhile Zelensky does not mention \u201cBurisma\u201d in the transcript, he does refer to \u201cthe company.\u201d Sources told the Times that the note-takers and transcription software used on the call missed Zelensky saying the word \u201cBurisma.\u201d Vindman also testified that, in one of the three areas where ellipses turn up on the transcript, Trump mentioned the Biden recordings.\n\nHouse Republicans complained after the hearing that Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) blocked certain Republicans from asking Vindman questions.\n\nWyoming Republican Liz Cheney pushed back at another counter-messaging strategy employed by conservative pundits, calling their suggestion that Vindman and other witnesses might have foreign allegiances \u201cshameful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about decorated veterans who have served this nation \u2026 It is shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this nation, and we should not be involved in that process,\u201d Cheney said.\n\nTrump doubled down on the transcript Monday morning, saying that \u201ca casual reading of the Transcript leads EVERYBODY to see that the call with the Ukrainian President was a totally appropriate one.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are very unified and energized in our fight on the Impeachment Hoax with the Do Nothing Democrats, and now are starting to go after the Substance even more than the very infair Process because just a casual reading of the Transcript leads EVERYBODY to see that\u2026.. \u2014 Donald J.
