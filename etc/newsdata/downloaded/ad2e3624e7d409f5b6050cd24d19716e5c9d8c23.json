It\u2019s pathetic. Seriously. Make a decision!\u201d Merson said in the Daily Star.\n\n\u201cWhen you start worrying about what your players think, you\u2019re in trouble. And why does he need five captains anyway?\n\n\u201cArsenal are one of the biggest clubs in the world but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s got a clue what his best team is.\n\n\u201cGranit Xhaka started off captain but he\u2019s not a foregone conclusion to start every week. So I\u2019ll tell you someone who should be \u2013 David Luiz. And that\u2019s why he should be captain.\n\nDavid Luiz, Arsenal\n\n\u201cNot as one of five either, but on his own. People look at his mistakes when they should be looking at what he\u2019s won.\n\n\u201cThe guy is a serial winner. Yes, he\u2019s either a nine out of 10 or a four out of 10 every week, but he never hides, whatever happens. I like that. That\u2019s leading by example.\n\n\u201cWhy not make him captain? He always comes across well and he was always a good influence on the young players at Chelsea. He was a leader there.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal being captain of a big club. To have a \u2018leadership group\u2019 of five players just devalues it. It\u2019s like you don\u2019t trust anyone enough to do it on their own.\n\n\u201cAnd asking players to vote is asking for trouble. What if they don\u2019t take it seriously? It becomes a farce.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t happen in a Sunday league team. I\u2019m surprised he doesn\u2019t give the fans a vote as well!\n\n\u201cArsenal have had some legendary captains in the past, but it\u2019s also a sign of how the game has changed that he\u2019s chosen to do this.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quicker, more technical. But there aren\u2019t as many leaders any more. When you look at the Invincibles, there were leaders everywhere in that team. Patrick Vieiria, Emanuel Petit, Sol Campbell.
