Key kick-off times in the Bundesliga affected are currently Fridays at 8.30pm, Saturdays at 6.30pm, Sundays at 1.30pm and Mondays at 8.30pm, leaving the Freiburg with just Saturday afternoon kick-off times to stage fixtures.\n\nThe ruling follows protests from nearby residents of Mooswald about anticipated levels of noise at the new 34,700-capacity stadium, which is slated for completion for next summer and at a cost of around \u20ac80m, according to StadiumDB.com.\n\nIn May, the club, currently sixth in the Bundesliga after eight games, beat a legal challenge to halt construction after local residents had filed a lawsuit against the building permit, citing concerns over noise and increased traffic. Freiburg\u2019s home since 1954 has been 24,000-capacity Schwarzwald-Stadion.\n\nOn announcing the club\u2019s plans had been granted a planning green light two years ago, Freiberg stated: \u201cIt should become a home, support identity and do justice to the high demands of design and functionality. There are already so many great ideas and so much passion, love and effort in this stadium \u2013 imagine what it will be like when it is brought to life by Freiburg fans?\u201d", "description": "Freiburg ordered not to hold night games or matches between 1pm and 3pm on Sundays at their new \u20ac80m stadium next season because of fears over noise", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3960c49902c290d77d8fb3606e46c666de7de2c/0_228_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=02c8ca3c37482aa05e122f57eb5fb391", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
