REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji\n\nWithin hours of the announcement, North Korea fired two unidentified projectiles east from its South Pyongan province, South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said.\n\nThe launches followed repeated short-range missile tests by North Korea since its leader Kim Jong Un agreed in a June 30 meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump to reopen working-level talks stalled since their failed February summit in Hanoi. The talks have yet to resume despite repeated U.S. appeals.\n\nA senior Trump administration official said later: \u201cWe are aware of reports of projectiles launched from North Korea. We are continuing to monitor the situation and consulting closely with our allies in the region.\u201d\n\nNorth Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said in a statement carried by the North\u2019s official KCNA news agency Pyongyang was willing to have comprehensive discussions with the United States in late September \u201cof the issues we have so far taken up\u201d at a time and place agreed between both sides.\n\nTrump was asked about the offer while speaking to reporters at the White House and called it \u201cinteresting\u201d. He also mentioned, as he often does, his \u201cgood relationship\u201d with Kim.\n\n\u201cI just saw it as I\u2019m coming out here, that they would like to meet. We\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI always say having meetings is a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201d\n\nAsked for comment on the North Korea statement, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have any meetings to announce at this time.\u201d\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday he hoped for a return to denuclearisation talks in the coming days or weeks, while reiterating the U.S. objective of North Korea\u2019s complete denuclearisation and saying Washington was disappointed by North Korean short-range missile tests.\n\nTrump has sought to play down such short-range tests, saying they do not violate a North Korean freeze in nuclear and long-range missile tests in place since 2017. He emphasised this freeze again when he spoke on Monday, before the latest launches.\n\n\u2018ENOUGH TIME\u2019\n\nIn her statement, Choe referred to a statement by Kim in April in which he set a year-end deadline for the United States to show more flexibility in talks. Those talks broke down in February over U.S. demands for North Korea to give up all of its nuclear weapons and Pyongyang\u2019s demands for relief from punishing U.S.-led international sanctions.\n\n\u201cI think the U.S. has since had enough time to find the calculation method that it can share with us,\u201d she said in an English-language version of her remarks carried by North Korea\u2019s official media.\n\n\u201cI believe that the U.S. side will come out with a proposal geared to the interests of the DPRK and the U.S. and based on the calculation method acceptable to us,\u201d she said, using the acronym for North Korea\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. side fingers again the worn-out scenario which has nothing to do with the new calculation method at the DPRK-U.S. working negotiation to be held with so much effort, the DPRK-U.S. dealings may come to an end,\u201d Choe said.\n\nThe end-of-September time frame would coincide with the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York, which Pompeo is due to attend. North Korea\u2019s mission to the United Nations said last week Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho would not attend \u201cdue to his schedule\u201d.\n\nNorth Korea has demanded that Pompeo be replaced with a \u201cmore mature\u201d person in the U.S. negotiating team, while lauding the rapport built between Kim and Trump in three meetings since June 2018.\n\nThe U.S. special representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, led working-level talks with North Korea in the run-up to the failed Hanoi meeting.\n\nBiegun said in a speech at the University of Michigan on Friday Washington\u2019s aim was to transform relations with Pyongyang and establish a permanent peace on the Korean peninsula, but stressed that this would require the elimination of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nEmbarking on an \u201cintensive set of negotiations\u201d is necessary, Biegun said, adding that \u201cthe diplomatic opening is fragile\u201d and expressing concern about North Korea\u2019s continuing weapons development.\n\nThere were immediate actions the United States could take if negotiations made progress, Biegun said without elaborating.\n\nThe steps Washington has so far offered North Korea publicly have fallen far short of Pyongyang\u2019s expectations.\n\nBefore the Hanoi summit, U.S. officials raised the possibility that, while sanctions would remain, Washington might be willing to take interim steps such as boosting humanitarian aid or opening liaison offices.", "description": "North Korea said on Monday it was willing to restart nuclear talks with the United States in late September but warned that dealings between the sides could end unless Washington takes a fresh approach.", "authors": ["Hyonhee Shin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428129304&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8900K", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
