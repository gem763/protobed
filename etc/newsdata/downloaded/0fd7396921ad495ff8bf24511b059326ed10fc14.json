This week a jury ruled he must pay Mr Pozner close to half a million dollars in damages.\n\nMr Fetzer, a retired University of Minnesota Duluth professor, called the figure \"absurd\" and said he would appeal. He had argued that the statements in his book were \"true\" and insisted there was no proof it was the inspiration for Mr Pozner's harassers.", "description": "The father of a boy killed in America's 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting has been awarded $450,000 in a defamation suit against conspiracy theorists who claimed it never happened.", "authors": ["Rozina Sabur", "Allister Heath", "Sherelle Jacobs", "Stephen Bush"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000213231405-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqSYRGcnYRAWy9a1w-mbEQrpfhyHuANl8SSbAeQyxyAwM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
