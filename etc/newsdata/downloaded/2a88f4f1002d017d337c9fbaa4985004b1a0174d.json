He pleaded no contest in May to the mistreatment of an animal causing death, disorderly conduct and contacting a victim after a domestic abuse arrest. A no contest plea isn't an admission of guilt but is treated as such for sentencing purposes.\n\nProsecutors allege that Shearer killed the 6-month-old dog with a roofing hammer because he was upset it had urinated and defecated in the woman's house.\n\nA judge set several sentencing conditions for Shearer, including that he serve four years of probation, comply with treatment programs, undergo anger management counseling and maintain \"absolute sobriety.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
