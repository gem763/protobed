REUTERS/George Frey/File Photo\n\nPurdue, which filed for Chapter 11 on Sunday, has said it sought bankruptcy to implement a settlement with the state and local governments who have accused it of deceptive marketing of opioids by overstating benefits and downplaying risks.\n\nThe settlement, which is estimated to be worth up to $12 billion, would require the Sackler family to cede ownership of Purdue to a trust, to sell their non-U.S. pharmaceutical businesses and to contribute at least $3 billion.\n\nThe hearing in White Plains, New York, could be an opportunity for opponents of the settlement to spell out their objections to the proposed deal.\n\nThe company has said in court filings it was facing an \u201cunmanageable\u201d amount of litigation over its alleged role in a public health crisis that has been blamed for nearly 400,000 overdose deaths between 1999 and 2017, according to the latest U.S. data.\n\nPurdue said it was on track to spend $263 million this year defending itself, according to court filings.\n\nThe Chapter 11 promises to be contentious. Purdue said in court filings it will ask U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain to pause the lawsuits brought by governments while the bankruptcy goes forward.\n\nIt said it will also seek an injunction to stop litigation against the Sackler family, who have not sought bankruptcy protection.\n\nPurdue also said it would make an unprecedented request of the court - to impose an injunction against itself.\n\nThe company said the injunction against itself is meant to demonstrate beyond any doubt that it has no intention to try to use bankruptcy to skirt the government investigations. Purdue said in a court filing the injunction against Purdue would force the company to curtail promotion of the sale of opioids, among other restrictions.\n\nFor the most part, Tuesday\u2019s hearing will be used by Purdue to seek approval of several routine motions to keep its business running.\n\nUnlike most companies in Chapter 11 bankruptcy that borrow money to keep their business operating, privately-held Purdue has no debt and will use its $1.36 billion in cash to finance its business, according to court documents.\n\nThat should give the company more flexibility during the course of its bankruptcy.", "description": "OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP is expected in court on Tuesday to lay out its plan for using bankruptcy to resolve more than 2,600 lawsuits alleging the company fueled the U.S. opioid crisis.", "authors": ["Tom Hals", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430810423&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0SP", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
