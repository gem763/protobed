Experts say infected ticks may have hitched a ride on migratory birds.\n\nEarlier this year, a European visitor, who has since recovered, became ill after being bitten by a tick while in the New Forest area, Public Health England says.\n\nFurther investigations revealed infected ticks were present in two locations in England.\n\nShould I worry?\n\nTicks are becoming more common across many parts of the UK, largely due to increasing deer numbers. Being bitten by one doesn't necessarily mean you will get sick.\n\nDr Nick Phin, from Public Health England, said: ''These are early research findings and indicate the need for further work. However, the risk to the general public is currently assessed to be very low.\"\n\nMost people who catch the virus will have no or only mild flu-like symptoms. But the disease can progress to affect the brain and central nervous system and can sometimes be fatal.\n\nTicks can also carry other diseases that can make people ill including Lyme disease.\n\nDr Phin said: \"We are reminding people to be 'tick aware' and take tick precautions, particularly when visiting or working in areas with long grass such as woodlands, moorlands and parks.\"\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nTo reduce the risk of being bitten, cover your skin, tuck your trousers into your socks, use insect repellent and stick to paths\n\nIf you are bitten, remove the tick with fine-tipped tweezers or a tick-removal tool found in chemists\n\nClean the bite with antiseptic or soap and water\n\nYou should go to your GP if you think you may have been bitten by a tick in the past month and develop flu-like symptoms or a circular red rash\n\nTicks feed on the blood of animals and people.\n\nThey cannot jump or fly but live in vegetation and wait for a passing animal or human to climb on to.", "description": "Public Health England says it has found tick-borne encephalitis virus in ticks in the UK for the first time.", "authors": ["Michelle Roberts", "Health Editor", "Bbc News Online"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/18116/production/_109428589_gettyimages-1076602744.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
