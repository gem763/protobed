When we got in we got one VK each.\n\n'I was a little bit tipsy at that point, but then it started wearing off.'\n\nAfter a round of shots, Miss Petch sat in the club's smoking area talking to her friends when she was offered a glass of water, which she believes may have been the drink that was spiked on on Monday, September 16.\n\n'We sat in the smoking area and I was quite drunk,' she said. 'A boy who was there gave me a glass of water, or at least he said it was water.\n\n'I don't know whether it was that that had been spiked, but I can't remember anything after that. I remember feeling really sick and then everything went black.'\n\nThis was the start of a nightmare for Miss Petch as the night soon spiraled out of control.\n\n'My friends have told me that in the space of half an hour, I went saying it was the best night ever to needing to go home,' the criminology and sociology student said.\n\nWhile on a night out with her friends, her drink was spiked leaving her with no memory of large parts of the evening. It caused multiple bouts of vomiting and led to her being admitted to A&E at Lincoln County Hospital\n\n'They said I was slumped back and just wanted to go to sleep. Then I was sick in the smoking area.\n\n'We went home but every five seconds I was stopping to be sick and I was passing out. I fell into the road, I landed on my arm I smacked the back of my head on the pavement.\n\n'At this point my friend's flatmate picked me up and carried me - I was completely unconscious.'\n\nWhile being carried home, Miss Petch woke up and called out for her friend.\n\n'I was asking where my friend was and saying the people carrying me weren't my friends,' she said.\n\n'This is despite the fact she was right there and I knew who she was from before university.'\n\nThe University of Lincoln (pictured) student woke up the next morning in her accommodation with no memory of how she had got there\n\nMiss Petch woke up the next morning in her accommodation with no memory of how she had got there.\n\n'I woke up and I had no idea where I was, that's never happened to me after a night out before,' she said.\n\n'My bank balance showed I hadn't drunk any more than I usually drink and I don't normally get drunk on that.\n\n'Normally when I drink a lot, I would get hangover. I didn't feel hungover at all. I felt way worse, it was a different kind of feeling.'\n\nAfter going out for breakfast, Miss Petch came back to her accommodation only for her condition to deteriorate.\n\n'I came back and slept until 10am,' she said. 'I felt like I'd torn something in my stomach. I felt really unsteady and I was throwing up.\n\n'Everything I was drinking and eating I couldn't keep down. My sick was neon green so I knew something wasn't right.'\n\nMiss Petch and her friend got a taxi to A&E at Lincoln County Hospital where she discovered she had been spiked.\n\n'The doctor said you've been spiked,' she said. 'They couldn't tell me what I'd been spiked with as they didn't have the equipment to do a urine test.\n\nThey gave me a prescription for anti-sickness tablets and sent me home.'\n\nDespite what happened, Miss Petch is not letting the incident get her down and she is being more cautious on her nights out now (stock image)\n\nMiss Petch is now warning people to take care if they are drinking on a night out, as it is something that can happen to anyone.\n\n'My dad was constantly reminding me about it before I went to university,' she said.\n\n'I'd heard of it happening before, but I didn't think it was going to happen to me.\n\n'I've been a bit more anxious, I'm constantly looking over my shoulder and I'm a bit more apprehensive when I'm out.\n\n'Don't leave your friends alone, it's very important you look out for everybody. I'm very lucky that people were looking out for me - I don't know what the intentions of the person who spiked me were.'\n\nDespite what happened, Miss Petch is not letting the incident get her down and she is being more cautious on her nights out now.\n\n'I'm not going to let it stop me enjoying myself, I'm just a bit more careful,' she said.\n\n'I buy my own drinks and before I might turn away while it was being poured to talk to someone, but now I watch it being poured in front of me.\n\n'I've got a little plastic lid that you can put over your cup and put a straw in to cover your drink. Unfortunately there isn't one for bottles so I just cover the bottle with my hand now.'", "description": "Lily Petch, 18, is a first year student at the University of Lincoln.
