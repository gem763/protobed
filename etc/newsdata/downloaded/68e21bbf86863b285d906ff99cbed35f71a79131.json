It will air live on MSNBC and on Radio One, and it will stream on MSNBC and washingtonpost.com.\n\nAD\n\nMitchell and Maddow are familiar TV-news figures. Mitchell has been a correspondent for NBC News since 1978, and she currently serves as chief foreign affairs reporter for NBC News. She also hosts a daytime program on MSNBC.\n\nAD\n\nMaddow, the host of \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show\u201d on MSNBC, is the cable network\u2019s most popular personality and a longtime critic of President Trump.\n\nBoth have moderated debates before. Mitchell co-moderated a Democratic candidates\u2019 debate in 2016.\n\nMaddow has moderated several debates, including the first Democratic debate in June and one in 2016. Her status as a liberal opinion host has raised questions about whether she should serve as a debate moderator, a role traditionally reserved for reporters.\n\nAD\n\nWelker is a White House correspondent for NBC News. Parker has the same position at The Post.\n\nThe venue and format for the debate hasn\u2019t yet been announced.\n\nSo far, eight candidates have met fundraising and polling criteria set by the Democratic National Committee to qualify for the next debate. Candidates are required to attract at least 3 percent in four state or national polls or 5 percent in two state polls. Candidates are also required to draw contributions from 165,000 unique donors, including 600 unique donors in 20 states.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to The Post\u2019s tracking, the eight candidates who appear to have qualified so far are former vice president Joe Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, California Sen. Kamala D. Harris, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, billionaire Tom Steyer, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and businessman Andrew Yang.\n\nNBC said former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke appear to have reached the donor requirement, but they have not met the polling minimums.\n\nAD", "description": "Kristen Welker and Ashley Parker will also moderate the debate presented by MSNBC and The Washington Post.", "authors": ["Paul Farhi", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xwqzsKzG3_O7GYkVyVLFhoHkplc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3E5YTKWVZAI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
