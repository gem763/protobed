It\u2019s based on the unfair and partisan process that Mr. Schiff has been running,\u201d Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan said.\n\nRepublicans demanded that Democrats release the full testimony of former Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, who met with lawmakers last week, to the public, arguing without it, Americans are only getting a sliver of the story.\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t because it destroys his narrative. It undercuts it. It blows it up,\u201d said Rep. Lee Zeldin, New York Republican.\n\nMr. Sondland has emerged as a prominent figure in the Ukrainian issue, appearing in text messages released by Democrats discussing the delay of military aid and working with Mr. Volker to get a commitment from the Ukrainians to open an investigation in Democratic candidate Joseph R. Biden and his son, Hunter, who had business dealings in the country.\n\nThe intelligence committee\u2019s work has become the central point of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry against President Trump.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
