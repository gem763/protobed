The thread, which was posted in chronological order starting with \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d in 1937, reveals not just Disney\u2019s best-known titles but also its long tail of cult classics, flops, oddities and other lesser-known films.\n\nIt. Is. Time. From Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to The Mandalorian, check out basically everything coming to #DisneyPlus in the U.S. on November 12. Pre-order in the U.S. at https://t.co/wJig4STf4P today: https://t.co/tlWvp23gLF pic.twitter.com/0q3PTuaDWT \u2014 Disney+ (@disneyplus) October 14, 2019\n\nTo date, Disney has advertised the extensive catalog coming to Disney+, which launches on November 12, by highlighting the top titles from Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, NatGeo and more.\n\nIt has also touted its dozens of upcoming original productions like \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d a \u201cLady and the Tramp\u201d remake, a \u201cRogue One\u201d prequel, \u201cHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series,\u201d and many others.\n\nBut today\u2019s Twitter thread is a reminder that Disney\u2019s back catalog goes deep.\n\nFor every Disney animation classic, there\u2019s a crappy direct-to-video sequel, like \u201cBelle\u2019s Magical World,\u201d for example. There are the cheesy \u201980s TV shows. And while Pixar may have spun \u201cToy Story\u201d into one of its best-known franchises, it also produced the broadly panned \u201cCars 2.\u201d\n\nThen there are the titles you may have forgotten \u2014 or never knew existed in the first place \u2014 from \u201cMeet the Deedles\u201d to \u201cZenon Girl of the 21st Century\u201d to \u201cFuzzbucket\u201d to \u201cThe Computer Who Wore Tennis Shoes\u201d to that movie about the country bears.\n\nThe Computer Wore Tennis Shoes (1969) pic.twitter.com/gTPlil506k \u2014 Disney+ (@disneyplus) October 14, 2019\n\nFor anyone who grew up on Disney, the list is a nostalgic look back at not just the studio\u2019s hits, but also the titles that quickly faded from your memory, or those that even make you cringe.\n\nWhile most streaming services today round out their catalog lineup with less popular content in order to claim a larger number of total titles available, they don\u2019t tend to promote their B movies and crappy TV shows in any of their marketing or advertising, for obvious reasons.\n\nDisney\u2019s approach, by comparison, is refreshingly transparent.\n\nWhile you may never have watched \u201cThe Biscuit Eater\u201d or \u201cJustin Morgan Had a Horse\u201d or \u201cThe Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad,\u201d and may never care to, Disney+ is at least letting you know what sort of filler content comes with your $6.99 per month subscription.\n\nJustin Morgan Had a Horse (1972) pic.twitter.com/SbyxF8m7MK \u2014 Disney+ (@disneyplus) October 14, 2019\n\nAs you scroll your way down through one of the biggest tweetstorms ever, you\u2019ll likely come across a few niche titles that appeal to you, despite not being the stuff of headlines. And because each title gets its own tweet, you can let everyone know exactly how excited you are for \u201cThe Cat from Outer Space,\u201d or anything else that strikes you.\n\nGlad to see this Disney live action cat movie on @disneyplus, but there is a noticeable lack of THE THREE LIVES OF THOMASINA. https://t.co/ZWN649Ezm2 \u2014 Jordan Hamessley (@thejordache) October 14, 2019\n\nToday\u2019s massive tweetstrom wasn\u2019t the only way that Disney overloaded one of its social channels to demonstrate the size of its back catalog. It also put together an over 3-hour YouTube video that previews everything coming to Disney+.\n\nDisney+ is available for pre-order ahead of its November 12 launch.", "description": "In an impressive bit of pre-launch marketing, Disney today announced by way of a massive Twitter thread basically every movie and TV show coming to its upcoming streaming service Disney+.
