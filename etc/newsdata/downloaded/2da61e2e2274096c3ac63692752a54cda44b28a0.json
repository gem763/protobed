The meetings ended up taking place four hours later, with one scheduled for staffers who were getting laid off and separate meeting for those who were not, according to a source.\n\nMeredith theMaven, which licensed the rights to Sports Illustrated's print and digital publications in June, is behind the decision as it takes full ownership of the company from Meredith Corporation.Meredith sold the Sports Illustrated brand and intellectual property to marketing company Athletic Brands Group earlier this year but had agreed to manage the media business for up to two years.\n\nRumors about impending changes and layoffs have loomed over the company ever since theMaven took over. The Seattle-based startup also announced in June that Ross Levinsohn has agreed to serve as CEO of the new company, which will be named Sports Illustrated Media. Levinsohn had a short stint as publisher and CEO of the Los Angeles Times, but was put on unpaid leave in 2018 over \"questionable behavior\" in his past, which he denied.\n\ntheMaven plans to hire about 200 contractors to increase Sports Illustrated's local sports coverage, according to a source familiar with the situation.\n\nRead More", "description": "Sports Illustrated cut more than 40 members of its staff on Thursday as part of a restructuring plan.", "authors": ["Kerry Flynn", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191003100747-sports-illustrated-app--stock-super-tease.jpg"}
