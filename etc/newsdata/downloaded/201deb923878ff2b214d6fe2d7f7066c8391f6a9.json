First person shooters and puzzle games make it plainly obvious what they\u2019re about but \u2018playing a role\u2019 says almost nothing. The origins of the term date back to tabletop role-playing games and it\u2019s those early dungeon crawlers which still influence so much of the genre, even though a role-player needn\u2019t be about combat or orcs or any kind of traditional setting or gameplay. And if nothing else that\u2019s something Disco Elysium ably proves.\n\nDisco Elysium is at once in love with the old Baldur\u2019s Gate era of computer role-playing games (especially Planescape: Torment) and desperate to do its own thing. It reveres the stats and dice rolls of a tabletop game and at the same time tries to offer an experience that could only happen in a modern video game. It challenges the conventions and clich\u00e9s of the genres while at the same time forcing you to play as a character with amnesia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bifurcated aspirations are not nearly as ruinous as it might sound and the fact that the majority of the game works despite the weird juxtaposition of old and new is a large part of the appeal. Perhaps inevitably, the end result is the role-playing equivalent of Marmite but for those that love Disco Elysium it\u2019s going to end up as one of their favourite games of the year.\n\nThe game begins with you waking up naked on a bed, your amnesia apparently caused by a massive drink and drugs binge that has left you with no idea of who you are or what you\u2019re doing. It transpires that you\u2019re a police detective, which is one helpful revelation, although your bloated middle-aged body is clearly in no better state than the grotty, dystopian city outside \u2013 part of a weird 70s steampunk world where the case of a recent lynching is just one of many mysteries to solve.\n\nDisco Elysium is a fantastically ambitious game but it\u2019s almost immediately obvious that it\u2019s biting off a lot more than it can safely consume. When we say it\u2019s in love with old school role-players we mean it is absolutely obsessed with using dice rolls to determine whether you succeed in whatever task you\u2019re trying to accomplish. There\u2019s very little real combat and yet you can easily die if luck goes against you, whether you\u2019re arguing with criminals or just trying to avoid having a heart attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiving so much importance to a random roll of virtual dice is clearly not something everyone is going to be happy with, but as controversial as that might be the game\u2019s skill system is an unequivocal triumph. Like a lot of things in Disco Elysium it seems, on the surface, to be very traditional, as you spend skill points to increase your physical and mental skills. Except while there are familiar stalwarts like endurance and logic there\u2019s also more esoteric skills like savoir faire and electro-chemistry.\n\nAt first it seems like the game is just trying to be weird for weirdness\u2019 sake but then the voices start and you realise you\u2019re not playing the character in the usual outward sense but their inner voice. The amnesia isn\u2019t just a nod to traditionalism, it\u2019s an excuse to allow you to build up your character\u2019s personality from basic building blocks. Like Homer arguing with his own brain, the different parts of your psyche, represent by the 24 different skills, are in constant conflict with each other, exerting more or less influence depending on your decisions and external forces.\n\nDisco Elysium (PC) \u2013 action, adventure, and lots and lots of reading\n\nIf the game isn\u2019t sounding odd enough already, we haven\u2019t even mentioned all the text yet. Despite some very nice visuals, that make the whole game look like a moving piece of pre-production artwork, Disco Elysium primarily uses prose to illustrate what\u2019s happening. A lot of prose. Developer ZA/UM (who have moved from Estonia to set up a studio in London) estimate there\u2019s a million words in total, but it feels like more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis quickly begins to feel like a mistake though, as not only does it mean you spend far too long staring inertly at the screen, almost like a visual novel or old school text adventure, but the writing is highly variable. It\u2019s rarely actively bad but it\u2019s very obvious that it\u2019s by multiple different authors and many of the styles do not gel at all well. Not to mention that some descriptions ramble on forever to no obvious purpose.\n\nThere are far more good ideas in Disco Elysium than there a bad though. The Thought Cabinet, for example, allows you to incubate ideas you come across from speaking to other people and gain otherwise unattainable buffs and debuffs. That\u2019s a great idea, that strengths the link between interacting with the world and your own personality, and we\u2019d love to see it picked up by other games.\n\nAt the very least we\u2019re very interested to see what ZA/UM do next because, as far we can tell, this is their first game. It\u2019s a hell of debut, even if the flaws are obvious. For a game, indeed a genre, that\u2019s all about player choice far too much is taken out of your hands, by both your warring inner-self and the roll of the dice. There\u2019s also the fact that at well over 40 hours it\u2019s much too long, especially as the central murder mystery isn\u2019t very gripping (and certainly doesn\u2019t trouble Return Of The Obra Dinn in terms of great detective games).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisco Elysium would have been better off being considerably shorter and encouraging multiple playthroughs, rather than just leaving you exhausted and overstuffed at the end. But we\u2019ll take a flawed but ambitious game over a polished but formulaic one every time. And even with its problems this is still a much-needed attempt to rethink \u2013 literally \u2013 how RPGs work and try to find a different way to play your in-game role.\n\nDisco Elysium review summary In Short: A fiercely original take on traditional computer role-playing games that often seems unrefined and self-indulgent but is still a welcome shake-up of genre norms. Pros: Highly original approach to common role-playing mechanics, especially in terms of the excellent skill system and sandbox style problem-solving. Interesting game world and visuals. Cons: The mountains of text are completely overboard and the game is far too long. Strict adherence to dice rolls is very frustrating. Conflicting skills leave you feeling like you lack control.
