Instead, a majority of MPs and Lords would need to agree and vote through the rules, and there would likely be deep divisions over the wording of the question, the number of options on the ballot paper and the voting system.\n\nWhat about the EU?\n\nEU Council President Donald Tusk has acknowledged receipt of the UK's extension request and said he would consult EU leaders \"on how to react\".\n\nAmbassadors from the 27 EU nations met for about 15 minutes in Brussels on Sunday morning and continued the legal process of ratifying the Brexit deal on the EU side.\n\nThe EU's Chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told diplomats the passage of the Letwin amendment did not mean that the deal had been rejected.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sir Oliver Letwin: Brexit deal \"is not perfect but it will do\"\n\nMr Letwin himself told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday his amendment was \"an insurance policy\" and now it had passed, he would give his full support to the prime minister's deal.\n\nAll 27 EU nations must agree to any extension to Brexit, and French President Emmanuel Macron has already signalled he believed a new Brexit extension was not good for anyone.\n\nHowever, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said if the alternative was a no-deal Brexit, the EU was unlikely to refuse - although it would want to know what any extension was for - a general election, another referendum, or merely a bit more time needed to pass Brexit-related legislation?\n\nCould this all end up in court?\n\nJust weeks after the Supreme Court ruled Mr Johnson's prorogation of Parliament was unlawful, some suggest his attempts to undermine the Benn Act with a second letter could see him back there again.\n\nShadow chancellor John McDonnell suggested the PM could be \"in contempt of Parliament or the courts\".\n\nThat was echoed by SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme, he refused to be drawn on any court action this week, but said \"there is a clear case that he is in contempt of Parliament\".\n\nThe government insists it has complied with the requirements of the Benn Act.\n\nWhat is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill?\n\nThe UK needs to pass a law to implement the withdrawal agreement - the part of the PM's Brexit deal which will take the country out of the EU - in UK law.\n\nIt has to secure the backing of a majority of MPs and peers, and a vote for the Brexit deal itself is no guarantee of a vote for the legislation required to implement it.\n\nThe bill gives legal affect to any agreed transition period and fulfils requirements on the rights of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit. It will also allow ministers to make \"divorce payments\" to the EU foreseen under the current deal.\n\nMPs will be able to vote on amendments - changes or add-ons - to the bill, for instance stipulating Parliament's role in the future relationship negotiation, or for the deal to be put to a referendum.\n\nIf the government cannot get the WAB through Parliament the default legal position is that the UK cannot ratify the deal, and so would leave on 31 October without a deal. However, that is dependent on no extension beyond that date having been already agreed with the EU.\n\nDo you have any questions about the latest Brexit developments?\n\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.
