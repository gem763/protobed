Now, at the Conservative Party conference, the Chancellor, Sajid Javid, has promised the funds to make that happen.\n\nOr has he?\n\nIn the press release previewing a speech promising as much as \u00a350bn in new infrastructure spending, there is this section about broadband.\n\n\"We are setting out plans to invest \u00a35bn to support the rollout of full-fibre, 5G and other gigabit-capable networks to the hardest-to-reach 20% of the country,\" it says.\n\n\"This doubles the previous commitment to support rollout to the hardest 10%.\"\n\nLast year's Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review, commissioned by Theresa May's government, set an \"ambitious target\" of full fibre - a pure fibre-optic cable running directly into the building rather than to a roadside cabinet - reaching 15 million premises by 2025.\n\nThe whole country - including about 30 million homes as well as millions more businesses and public buildings - would be covered by 2033, it added.\n\nAnd a government statement at the time said this would \"require require additional funding of around \u00a33bn to \u00a35bn to support commercial investment in the final 10% of areas\".\n\nFresh target\n\nBut in June, as he stood for the leadership of the Conservative Party, Boris Johnson described that strategy as \"laughably unambitious\".\n\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph, he said: \"We should commit now to delivering full fibre to every home in the land not in the mid-2030s - but in five years at the outside.\"\n\nThat 2025 target was reaffirmed - albeit somewhat less explicitly - in speeches after Mr Johnson won the Conservative leadership contest and as he entered No 10. There was talk of \"fantastic full-fibre broadband sprouting in every household\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption 5G mobile technology is available in only a few UK cities\n\nNow, the chancellor is promising \u00a35bn to make that sprouting happen - but fulfilling that pledge to move the target eight years earlier should mean the cost goes up. After all, this is a massive building project. Scarce workers will have to be recruited and trained and materials bought.\n\nTell your builder your extension has to be built by Christmas, not next summer and you'll find the bill spirals.\n\nAnd it's not just about having a tighter deadline.\n\nThe 2033 target envisaged the government providing funds to cover the 10% of the country that would not be reached by private-sector investment.\n\nMoving the goal forward means it now expects 20% of the UK won't have been covered by the commercial sector in time.\n\nSo, the chancellor appears to be expecting to get a lot out of the \u00a35bn, assuming he really is sticking to the promise of full-fibre for all - a much faster more extensive programme to bring the best possible broadband to everyone, without dipping deeper into public funds.\n\nI was given a glimpse of some of the issues last month, when I visited the remote island community on Grimsay, in the Hebrides, which had recently been given full-fibre broadband.\n\nIt had proved pretty expensive, something like \u00a34,000 to hook up each household, with much of the funding coming from the Scottish government.\n\nAnd while the inhabitants were naturally enthusiastic about the project, their neighbours on other islands had immediately begun asking: \"What about us?\"\n\nWatering down?\n\nThere is one more puzzling thing about the chancellor's speech - does it contain a watering down of the prime minister's full-fibre pledge?\n\nIt talks of investment not just in fibre but in \"5G and other gigabit-capable networks\".\n\nNow, some in the telecoms industry have suggested laying a fibre connection up every remote farm track or mountainside may not be sensible when other technologies such as 5G or even low earth-orbit satellites could supply similar speeds.\n\nBut fibre purists - and that seems to include the prime minister - insist it is the only reliable option if we are not to have a two-speed country with rural areas left in the slow lane.\n\nAnd Mr Javid's team is not providing much more clarity, except to say \"gigabit-capable\" broadband networks will be provided to everyone and further details will be set out later this year in the National Infrastructure Strategy.", "description": "The chancellor has announced plans to boost UK broadband - but it is not clear what he is promising.", "authors": ["Rory Cellan-Jones", "Technology Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A98C/production/_108840434_409a186b-7013-403f-884d-2917516980d8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
