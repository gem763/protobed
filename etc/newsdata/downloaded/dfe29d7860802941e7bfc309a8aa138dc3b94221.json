(Photo: undefined undefined via Getty Images)\n\nSnake print stilettos, strappy heels, boat shoes and dad sneakers are just a few of the shoe styles you\u2019ll find hiding in Zappos\u2019 end-of-summer sale that\u2019s going on now.\n\nUsing code ENDOFSUMMER, shoppers can get an extra 20% off select already-on-sale men\u2019s, women\u2019s and children\u2019s styles at Zappos through Wednesday, Sept. 25. Though most of us think of Zappos as a destination for footwear, there\u2019s actually more clothing marked down for the sale than shoes, including Levi\u2019s jeans, Free People apparel and The North Face workout gear.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that Zappos prices at the color level, so select shades may be on sale, while others aren\u2019t. The bad news? Zappos said the sale wraps up end-of-day on Sept. 25, so you might want to jump on this deal before it\u2019s done.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ve rounded up some of our favorite shoes styles that are part of the sale, including many that would look great for those fall weddings on your calendar.
