The answer is no.\"\n\nThe ASA said it had received no evidence that Beauty Boutique Aesthetics had the trained staff or resources to deal with any adverse reactions to procedures they administered.\n\nIt added that it is against the UK advertising code to market prescription-only medicines like Botox.\n\nEarlier this month, Instagram said it will start restricting posts that promote cosmetic surgery and weight-loss products for users under 18.\n\nEmma Collins, Instagram\u2019s public policy manager, said the company worked with external experts to make the changes.\n\n\u201cWe want Instagram to be a positive place for everyone that uses it and this policy is part of our ongoing work to reduce the pressure that people can sometimes feel as a result of social media,\u201d Collins explained.\n\n\u201cWe've sought guidance from external experts, including Dr Ysabel Gerrard in the UK, to make sure any steps to restrict and remove this content will have a positive impact on our community of over one billion people around the world \u2013 whilst ensuring Instagram remains a platform for expression and discussion.\u201d", "description": "Three Instagram adverts promoting cosmetic surgery have been banned for claiming the procedures could make customers look like members of the Kardashian-Jenner family.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/25/08/kim-kylie.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
