Well, Shonali Bose's The Sky Is Pink is like a love letter from the Chaudhary family to all of us.\n\nThe movie's the kind of love letter that tears you apart for all the right reasons, only to show you how beautiful it is to fall in love, show up for people you love and seize every moment in this lifetime.\n\nWhile death is the ultimate truth of life, it's also important to realise that no matter what life throws at you, you need to bounce back higher than ever and fight back.\n\nShonali Bose's directorial is an incredible love story of a couple spanning 25 years which is narrated by their teenage daughter - Aisha (Zaira Wasim). Aisha becomes a motivational speaker after being diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nThe film was screened at the 2019 Toronto Film Festival on September 13 and was attended by the complete cast and crew excluding Zaira Wasim. In case you are wondering what's special about The Sky Is pink, well, a lot of things are!\n\nDon't Miss 317 SHARES 2.9 K SHARES 444 SHARES 876 SHARES 145 SHARES\n\nHere are my reasons why this one should be on your 'to-watch' list! (Spoilers ahead)\n\n1. It's all about loving your family.\n\nFamily is the only constant of your life. While everything in life changes in the blink of an eye, family will always support and comfort you.\n\n2. It's very important to be transparent with your kids.\n\nAditi (Priyanka Chopra) trying to have a word with her daughter about sex is something we have never seen in films.\n\nWhile we always talk about dearth of progressive story line in films, Shonali's attempt in showing parent-daughter relationship through lens of modern parenting is adorable. Aditi may come across as someone who likes to micro-manage everyone's lives but her love is so selfless that you end up feeling like giving her a tight hug.\n\nShonali Bose's mature take on parenting is what we all needed.\n\n3. Everything in life comes with its own fragility index, even life itself.\n\nWhat's the point of bringing ego in relationships when everything, including your heart, breaks so easily in life? We take a lot of things in life for granted, including our relationships with our family\n\n4. It's all about seizing every little moment in your life.\n\nAisha's life span is less and she knows death is inevitable but does it stop her from fulfilling her dreams? Nope. She does what her heart wants and there's a message in it for all of us. The entire family decides to live life to the fullest in the short amount of time they have left with Aisha.\n\n5. Sometimes being hopelessly hopeful is the only thing you need in life.\n\n\"Aaj ek zindagi aur jee lo...\" said Shah Rukh Khan in Kal Ho Na Ho. And in The Sky Is Pink, you get this message in different ways. Even when Aditi knew that conceiving Aisha could be life-threatening, she goes ahead with it because it's important to have hope.\n\n6. We all need at least one family member who pulls everyone close to reality.\n\nGiraffe (Rohit Saraf) is the brother we all need in our lives. The way he consoles a shattered Aisha who is inching closer to her death is something that will make you cry. Scenes between Giraffe and Aisha have been written with so much love and honesty that your heart goes out for them.\n\n7. Never compromise; always paint your sky the way you want it to look.\n\nOne of my favourite scenes from the film is when Ishaan, as a kid, goes sobbing to his mother and tells her that his art teacher scolded him for painting the sky pink. Instead of telling him that the sky is blue, she inspires her son to paint the sky just the way he wants. Isn't Aditi the kind of mother everyone deserves?\n\n8. Romance is not just about fancy dates. It's about becoming the best version of yourself.\n\nThe way Aditi and Niren's romance blossoms in the film is something that we have not seen in films of today. From landline calls to how they fight against all odds to make their relationship work is inspiring on a lot of levels.\n\n9. No matter how small or big your heartbreak, you always have your family to fall back on.\n\nAisha goes through her first heartbreak in life, and instead of telling their daughter to move on, Aditi and Naren take her on a trip. No matter who stays or who leaves, you always have your family to fall back upon.\n\nThe Sky is Pink marks the Bollywood comeback of Priyanka after a hiatus of almost three years. It has been co-produced by Priyanka, Ronnie Screwvala and Siddharth Roy Kapur.", "description": "A love letter that tears you apart for all the right reasons, only to show you how beautiful it is to fall in love, show up for people you love and seize every moment in this lifetime.
