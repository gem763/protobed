He became just the second player in league history to throw for more than 300 yards in his first two games, too, joining only Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch NFL games on your phone for FREE with the Yahoo Sports app]\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a cool deal,\u201d Murray said after the game. \u201cBut, again, wish we could have won the game.\u201d\n\nMurray put the Cardinals in position to pick up their first win of the season on Sunday in Baltimore, rallying back from a 17-6 hole at halftime.\n\nThe 22-year-old completed a deep 54-yard pass to Larry Fitzgerald early in the fourth quarter, and backed it up with an 18-yard completion to Christian Kirk two plays later to put Arizona in scoring position. David Johnson then ran the ball in for the score, bringing the Cardinals within just three points.\n\nThis @K1 to @LarryFitzgerald connection has been \ud83d\udd25\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: FOX\n\n\ud83d\udcf1: NFL app // Yahoo Sports app\n\nWatch on mobile: https://t.co/y8YLGKmeTf pic.twitter.com/Jw7jW1NH9L \u2014 NFL (@NFL) September 15, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nThat run, though, simply wasn\u2019t enough. Baltimore kicked a 51-yard field goal to extend its lead and eventually pick up the six-point win behind yet another historic performance from Lamar Jackson.\n\nWhile he said he\u2019s \u201cnot cool\u201d with losing, Murray did say he thinks their offense had some positives to take away from Sunday \u2014 and he\u2019s starting to feel better at the helm of the team, too.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not where I want to be five years from now or whatever like that, but as far as being comfortable, I\u2019m feeling pretty good right now,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThey\u2019re a team that likes to bring a lot of pressure. They got back there a little bit today. I thought we handled it well for the most part, threw the ball well.\u201d\n\nArizona may not be winning yet, but the organization has to be happy with what their rookie quarterback has shown already this fall. And after two strong outings, the team doesn\u2019t expect he\u2019ll slow down anytime soon.\n\nMurray \u201cdoesn't surprise me,\" Kirk said, via ESPN. \"With what he's able to do, where he's able to put the ball, what he's able to do with his feet, it's what the guy does. And he's a winner. He's always going to give you the best position and put you in the right place to go win a football game.\"\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Murray threw for 349 yards in Arizona\u2019s loss to Baltimore on Sunday, and is now just the second player in NFL history to throw for at least 300 yards in his first two games.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FXlHwP9sL3RVV.mPP2WsgQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/D7NzlAXOLcxpiyPACOvweg--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/66bdccc0-d80d-11e9-a7f3-e3e4070abad9", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
