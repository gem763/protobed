But we are not talking about one or two students.\n\n\"This is a couple of hundred students per year who have made a significant investment of time and money in a degree from which they are unlikely to benefit.\n\n\"As our regulatory framework sets out, admissions systems must be reliable, fair and inclusive. What we are seeing here are admissions systems that are not fair, and are not working in students' best interests.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nA spokesman for Universities UK said there were \"clear benefits\" in universities being able to use a variety of offer-making practices to reflect an individual student's circumstances, potential and the context of their application.\n\n\"An important principle of the UK system is that universities decide independently which students they accept; but with this comes a responsibility to explain why and how places are awarded, and to show the public and students why different types of offers are made,\" he added.\n\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said: \"I have already expressed my deep concerns about the continuing rise of unconditional offers.\n\n\"But what is equally alarming is that dropout rates for students with unconditional offers are estimated to be 10% higher than if they had a conditional offer.\n\n\"Students are being let down by the universities that are using these offers to get students through the door, but then not adequately supporting them once they begin their studies.\"", "description": "The Office for Students says 185 students who were not at risk of dropping out did so over two academic years.", "authors": ["Katherine Sellgren", "Bbc News Education Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E3C2/production/_109460385_gettyimages-462641909.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
