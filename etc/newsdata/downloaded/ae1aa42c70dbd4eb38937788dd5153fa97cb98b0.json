He called on Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, to \u201cman up\u201d and vote for one, claiming that parliament would only engage in \u201cpointless Brexitology\u201d if given the chance to debate his legislation without a hard deadline. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, claimed the government would simply lay motions \u201cagain and again\u201d until other parties agree to go to the polls.\n\nHowever, Corbyn made clear he would only vote for an election if Johnson made \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d to parliament on Monday that there would be no crash-out on WTO terms, because \u201chis deal includes the possibility of a no-deal exit\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest BorisJohnson insisted he would refuse to bring back his Brexit legislation unless MPs granted him a general election.

During a meeting of EU diplomats, the French ambassador stood alone in arguing that it was not the right time to agree a three-month delay, in a move that will be welcomed in Downing Street.\n\nIf the EU ultimately grants a three-month delay and Labour continues to refuse an election, Johnson might not be able to stop the withdrawal agreement being revived by backbenchers. The decision would rest with John Bercow, the Speaker, who could allow it to be \u201cunpaused\u201d by MPs as one of his last acts after a decade in the chair.\n\nLabour MP Peter Kyle said he was in talks with ex-Tories about their next steps. Bringing the agreement back to parliament was \u201cone of the options on the shelf\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d. Kyle said they had done all the preparatory work for this scenario in the summer and were ready to go with such a parliamentary move if needed, but wanted to see what the government and Corbyn did in the next few days.\n\nHe said he did not believe Johnson\u2019s threat that no Brexit legislation would be brought back to the Commons between now and Christmas, so backbenchers might not need to try and bring back the bill themselves but could amend his deal.\n\nSupport for a second referendum \u201cebbs and flows\u201d, Kyle said, but that presently \u201cthe tide is coming back on it\u201d among MPs.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Labour MP Peter Kyle MP said support for a second referendum \u2018ebbs and flows\u2019, but the tide was coming back.

The legislation would need a money resolution moved by the government, though MPs could hope simply to show progress on finding a majority for any one Brexit option.\n\nGrieve said: \u201cPolitics is the art of the possible and clearly it\u2019s been my argument for a long time that it would be desirable to have a second referendum and put the options available to the public to resolve the problems we have.\u201d\n\nOthers expressed scepticism that such a move would work. Nick Boles, a former Tory minister who voted for Johnson\u2019s deal, tweeted: \u201cThere is no such plan. And it wouldn\u2019t work, as taking a bill of this scale into committee requires a money resolution and Queen\u2019s consent, which only the government can provide.\u201d\n\nEven Conservative supporters of Johnson remained baffled on Friday by the prime minister\u2019s sudden U-turn on his Brexit deal earlier in the week, when he decided to pause it rather than allow more time to debate the legislation.\n\nOne minister told the Guardian that the views among colleagues was \u201cNo 10 has been churlish\u201d, while a backbench MP said the strategy emerging from Downing Street was \u201cvery confused\u201d and \u201cout of control\u201d.\n\nKeith Simpson, Conservative MP for Broadland, described the \u201cfloundering in No 10 as worthy of Baldrick in Blackadder\u201d, adding: \u201cThe problem is that circumstances beyond [Johnson\u2019s] control and things he has done has made 31 October almost impossible and I think what he\u2019s decided to do \u2013 supported by most, but not all of the cabinet \u2013 of trying to have a vote on a general election looks as though it\u2019s part of the people versus parliament but I think it\u2019s quite a risky strategy.\u201d", "description": "Supporters of a second referendum may try to seize control of timetable next week", "authors": ["Rowena Mason", "Kate Proctor", "Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50a9e151844a2d236a8925df7d4803358b38ec9e/0_142_4028_2417/master/4028.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fc873f09c0a4eb20d58c42655ac5b763", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
