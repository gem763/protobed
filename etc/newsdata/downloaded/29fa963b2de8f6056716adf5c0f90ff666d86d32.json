It\u2019s about what\u2019s happening on Saturday that\u2019s going to matter. Anything that\u2019s happened prior to that is irrelevant,\u201d Hansen told reporters on Monday.\n\nHe said the match in Dublin was a \u201ctitanic struggle\u201d and acknowledged that most teams raise their game \u201c10 percent\u201d when they play the All Blacks \u2014 the Irish being no different in this respect.\n\n\u201cBig difference here is it\u2019s a do-or-die game for both teams,\u201d noted Hansen, whose All Blacks will be huge favourites going into the match against an Ireland side that has failed to impress since their opening 27-3 win against Scotland.\n\n\u201cBoth teams are in good nick, fresh, and excited. We\u2019re looking forward to the challenge,\u201d said the coach, who will be facing countryman Joe Schmidt in the opposing camp.\n\nAll Black flanker Sam Cane said previous encounters between the two sides had been \u201cmassive arm-wrestles\u201d and \u201chugely physical\u201d but was also only looking ahead to Saturday\u2019s clash.\n\n\u201cThis is a Rugby World Cup play-off game, the past doesn\u2019t really count for anything,\u201d said Cane.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Pretty excited\u2019 \u2013\n\nHansen dismissed fears the All Blacks could be \u201cundercooked\u201d coming into the game, nearly a month after their last serious test \u2014 a 23-13 win over Rugby Championship rivals South Africa.\n\n\u201cHaving a week off is not a bad thing. We\u2019re quite excited by that fact,\u201d said Hansen, who added the All Blacks had trained at close to the intensity of a Test match on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t feel we\u2019ve lost any opportunity to get ourselves where we need to be,\u201d he said.\n\nHansen said he did not expect Ireland to change their way of playing, based around a solid kicking game from their fly-half Johnny Sexton, the reigning World Player of the Year, and scrum-half Conor Murray.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re pretty set on how they play, just like we are. They play to their strengths. Conor Murray does a lot of kicking. They use Sexton to drive them around the park and their big forwards to carry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would they want to change? It\u2019s been pretty successful for them,\u201d noted Hansen.\n\nBut he cautioned that while Sexton was an important cog in the Ireland machine, \u201cthey are more than a one-man team\u201d,\n\n\u201cI think they brought out the best in us for a long, long time,\u201d added Hansen, looking ahead to what promises to be a thriller in Tokyo Stadium.\n\n\u201cThat hasn\u2019t changed just because they\u2019ve beaten us a couple of times.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Past matches between Ireland and New Zealand will be irrelevant when the two teams take the pitch in the Rugby World Cup", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/065aa2_all-blacks-coach-steve-hansen-has-warned-his-players-avoid-dwelling-on-2016-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
