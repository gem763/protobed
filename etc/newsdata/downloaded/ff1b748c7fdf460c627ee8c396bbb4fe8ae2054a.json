Yes, free markets \u2014 and societies that cherish scientific research and innovation \u2014 have pioneered new industries, discovered cures that have saved millions from disease and unleashed prosperity that has lifted billions of people out of poverty. On a personal level, the success that I\u2019ve achieved has allowed me to embrace philanthropy and invest in improving local public schools and reducing homelessness in the San Francisco Bay Area, advancing children\u2019s health care and protecting our oceans. But capitalism as it has been practiced in recent decades \u2014 with its obsession on maximizing profits for shareholders \u2014 has also led to horrifying inequality. Globally, the 26 richest people in the world now have as much wealth as the poorest 3.8 billion people, and the relentless spewing of carbon emissions is pushing the planet toward catastrophic climate change. In the United States, income inequality has reached its highest level in at least 50 years, with the top 0.1 percent \u2014 people like me \u2014 owning roughly 20 percent of the wealth while many Americans cannot afford to pay for a $400 emergency. It\u2019s no wonder that support for capitalism has dropped, especially among young people.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Benioff has used this line. About a week ago, he said the same thing at a tech conference:\n\n\u201cI really strongly believe that capitalism as we know it is dead,\u201d Benioff said last Thursday night. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see a new kind of capitalism and that new kind of capitalism that\u2019s going to emerge is not the Milton Friedman capitalism that\u2019s just about making money.\u201d\n\nBenioff isn\u2019t quite calling for full communism but he is calling for having the government step in to ensure the good of workers and the environment are a larger part of corporate decision-making. Benioff wants corporations to commit to giving one percent of their equity, time, and product to charity. But because corporate charity can never be enough, the new capitalism also requires the government to step in with much higher taxes:\n\nA new capitalism must also include a tax system that generates the resources we need and includes higher taxes on the wealthiest among us. Local efforts \u2014 like the tax I supported last year on San Francisco\u2019s largest companies to address our city\u2019s urgent homelessness crisis \u2014 will help. Nationally, increasing taxes on high-income individuals like myself would help generate the trillions of dollars that we desperately need to improve education and health care and fight climate change.\n\nTwo things about all of this. First, there\u2019s a name for what Benioff is describing: Social democracy. Why not just call it what it is?\n\nSecond, notice these new taxes he\u2019s proposing to support the \u201cnew capitalism\u201d only fall on \u201chigh-income individuals.\u201d This claim, that only the rich need pay more to raise enough money for the left\u2019s expansive agenda, is a lie. The Nordic model which many American socialists have embraced is founded upon much higher taxes for the middle-class. Vox has said as much. So has Bernie Sanders. Elizabeth Warren has resisted admitting it\u2019s true and made herself look silly in the process. I wonder if Benioff would admit his plan actually entails higher taxes for almost everyone? I wonder if anyone will ask him?\n\nBenioff has a book coming out titled, \u201cTrailblazer: The Power of Business as the Greatest Platform for Change.\u201d I guess labeling social democracy \u201cnew capitalism\u201d is an innovation but I wouldn\u2019t call it trailblazing.", "description": "\"We\u2019re going to see a new kind of capitalism...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Marc-Benioff-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
