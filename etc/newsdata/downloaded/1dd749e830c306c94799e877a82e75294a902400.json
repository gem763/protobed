After the firing, he called 911 and the FBI and made \"rambling\" statements, FBI special agent Christopher Combs said Monday.\n\nFOX Business is choosing not to identify the gunman to stop his name from gaining notoriety for his crimes.\n\n\"This did not happen because he was fired,\" Combs said. \"He showed up to work enraged.\"\n\nWhen officers pulled him over for the traffic violation, the 36-year-old gunman pointed an AR-style rifle out of the back window of his car, shooting and injuring a trooper before he fled, shooting at random people across town.\n\nOf those shot and killed included a 29-year-old postal worker, Mary Grandos. The shooter hijacked her U.S. postal van, driving to a movie theater complex where he was eventually cornered by police and killed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials say the man had prior convictions for trespassing and evading arrest.\n\nState lawmaker Rep. Tom Craddick told the Midland Reporter-Telegram newspaper the shooter had previously failed a background check.

The three were visiting a car dealership where her brother was about to buy a truck he had been saving his money for. As the brother-sister pair walked out with the keys, the gunman drove by, killing her.\n\nAt least 22 other people were injured.\n\nThe officers serving the region were shot and injured in the havoc, but are expected to recover.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the shooter\u2019s firing was behind the rampage.\n\nPolice identified at 15 different locations between Midland and into Odessa are designated crime scenes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Reports and officials indicated the man lost his trucking job only a few hours before embarking on a rampage through Odessa, Texas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/AP19244800950039.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
