(AP) - The way Phil Kessel had been playing for the Arizona Coyotes at the start of the season, scoring a goal was just a matter of time.\n\nThe veteran forward put it all together Thursday night, scoring his first two goals for Arizona, and Christian Dvorak scored his third goal in two games as the Coyotes beat the Nashville Predators 5-2.\n\n\u201cIt feels nice to get one, and hopefully they start coming,\u201d said Kessel, whose had 11 consecutive seasons of 20 or more goals. \u201cI\u2019ve had a bunch of chances, our line\u2019s had a bunch of chances and eventually they go in.\u201d\n\nArizona (3-2-1), 3-0-1 in its last four games, went 3 for 6 on the power play. Darcy Kuemper stopped 23 shots and set a franchise record by allowing two goals or less in 12 consecutive games. Jakob Chychrun added his first goal of the season, and Carl Soderberg also scored.\n\nDante Fabbro and Nick Bonino scored for the Predators, who have lost two of three.\n\nThe Predators were without leading goal scorer Filip Forsberg, who came in with five on the season. Forsberg took a shoulder blow to his head in the Predators\u2019 5-2 win at Vegas on Tuesday and was a game-time decision with a lower body injury.\n\nArizona lost defenseman Jordan Oesterle 17 seconds into the game when a shot was deflected off the back of his head. Oesterle was taken to a hospital for a precautionary examination after feeling dizzy, and needed stitches.\n\nThe Coyotes didn\u2019t seem affected. Dvorak sent a shot from a difficult side angle high into the net past Juuse Saros at 6:06.\n\nKessel, a two-time Stanley Cup winner acquired in a trade with the Pittsburgh Penguins in the offseason, finished off a power play give-and-go with Clayton Keller, scoring at 10:34 of the first.\n\nKessel scored again on a power play for a three-goal lead, with Keller assisting at 5:03 of the third. Nick Schmaltz and Derek Stepan also had two assists.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t even panicking. He was getting his looks,\u201d Coyotes coach Rick Tocchet said of Kessel. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get him the puck in those areas, that\u2019s where he\u2019s a home run hitter.\u201d\n\nThe Predators made it 2-1 at 3:13 of the second with Fabbro\u2019s goal. Ryan Ellis assisted on both Predators goals, giving him a team-high eight assists.\n\nSaros blocked a breakaway attempt from the Coyotes\u2019 Derek Stepan at 9:13 of the second. Saros finished with 27 saves.\n\nChychrun, on another power play, scored on a left-handed wrist shot at 14:27. Schmaltz delivered him a no-look pass that led to the goal.\n\nThe Predators managed only three shots in the first period. They are 1-1-6 in their last eight games in Arizona.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of a team number than a \u2018me\u2019 number,\u201d Kuemper said of his record. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to do a whole lot. I thought this was maybe our best game yet.\u201d\n\nBonino scored late in the third, then Soderberg put the game out of reach with an empty-net goal at the 17:10 mark.\n\nThe Predators felt the Coyotes\u2019 speed was a factor.\n\n\u201cWe were out-worked, out-competed and out-skated. That\u2019s really it,\u201d Predators coach Peter Laviolette said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t put anything into it, we didn\u2019t get anything out of it.\u201d\n\nNOTES: The Coyotes celebrated Noche De Los Yotes, a tribute to Hispanic heritage, on Thursday night. Earlier in the day, the team announced the formation of the franchise\u2019s first ever Latino advisory board, which is headed by majority owner Alex Meruelo. Meruelo has said he intends to build more fan interest in the Coyotes within the Phoenix area\u2019s large Hispanic population. \u2026 The Coyotes played 59 minutes, 43 seconds of the game with five defensemen after Oesterle\u2019s injury. They were already without their top defenseman, Niklas Hjalmarsson, who is on injured reserve with a cracked fibula and could miss several months. \u2026 F Michael Grabner played in his 600th career NHL game. \u2026 Nashville\u2019s streak of five straight games with a power-play goal came to an end.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNashville: Hosts Florida on Saturday night.\n\nArizona: Hosts Ottawa on Saturday afternoon.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The way Phil Kessel had been playing for the Arizona Coyotes at the start of the season, scoring a goal was just a matter of time.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jose M.
