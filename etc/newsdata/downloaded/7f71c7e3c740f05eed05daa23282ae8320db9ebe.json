But even if not accustomed to the global spotlight, the wealthy hotelier, philanthropist and generous benefactor of political campaigns has long been comfortable around the well-connected on both sides of the political aisle.\n\n\u201cHe very much enjoyed having personal relationships with those in power,\u201d said David Nierenberg, a Washington state investment adviser who has known Sondland for years. \u201cSome people collect books. Some people collect cars. He collected those relationships.\u201d\n\nText messages released by House Democrats show Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, working with another of Trump\u2019s envoys to get Ukraine to agree to investigate any potential interference in the 2016 U.S. election and of the energy company that appointed Biden\u2019s son Hunter to its board. In exchange, the American officials dangled the offer of a Washington meeting with Trump for Ukraine\u2019s new president. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.\n\nThe messages also show Sondland trying to reassure a third diplomat that their actions were appropriate, but that they should take precautions by limiting their text messages.\n\n\u201cThe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promise during his campaign,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cI suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u201d\n\nLike the president who picked him, Sondland cut an unconventional path to becoming a Washington power broker.\n\nThe son of German immigrants who fled the Nazis in the 1930s and later founded their own dry cleaning business in Seattle, Sondland is best known in the Pacific Northwest as the founder of the Provenance Hotels chain. He and his wife also established a foundation that\u2019s bestowed millions of dollars on health care and regional arts and culture programs.\n\nWhile Sondland emerges in the texts as in sync with the president\u2019s wishes, he hasn\u2019t always been supportive of Trump himself. He took a meandering path to supporting the president, contributing over the years to eventual Trump adversaries like Mitt Romney and John McCain. In 2015, he donated thousands of dollars to a super PAC associated with Jeb Bush, Trump\u2019s Republican primary opponent.\n\nBut as Trump emerged as the Republican nominee, four limited liability corporations controlled by Sondland gave the Trump inaugural at least $1 million, according to Federal Election Commission records and business filings in Washington state and Oregon.\n\nHe still had concerns, though. In August 2016, Sondland and another hotelier, Bashar Wali, refused to take part in a fundraiser for Trump over his criticism of the Muslim parents of an American soldier killed in combat, The Willamette Week reported. A spokeswoman for his hotel chain told the publication at the time that their names were added without their approval to a draft invitation for the event, and that neither would be participating.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump\u2019s statements have made it clear that his positions do not align with their personal beliefs and values,\u201d Buska told the publication. \u201cNeither of them will be hosting or attending any fundraisers for the Trump campaign in Seattle or Portland.\u201d Buska did not return a call Monday from The Associated Press.\n\nNierenberg, who recalled Sondland working with him to promote Bush\u2019s presidential campaign, said he was perplexed to learn that Sondland had contributed to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee but suspected that it might have had something to do with an ambition to get an ambassadorship.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m profoundly troubled by something that is a lot bigger than Gordon\u2019s text messages,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who try to help the president wind up being thrown under the bus and soiled by their association with a person who is so profoundly narcissistic and ungrateful. Many good people have been hurt by their association with him. I\u2019m saddened to see this happening to Gordon, as it happened to so many people before him.\u201d\n\nIn his role as the Trump administration\u2019s representative to the EU, Sondland has articulated the president\u2019s agenda through forthright, occasionally abrasive statements.\n\nHe has bristled at what he claims is the slow pace of the EU\u2019s executive arm, the European Commission, in trade talks. He\u2019s criticized the EU\u2019s stance on the Iran nuclear agreement and even waded into the chaos surrounding Brexit, saying Britain has \u201cdecided to leave, and we want them to leave in a way that they are free to do business with the United States.\u201d\n\nLen Bergstein, a Portland, Oregon, political consultant who had worked with Sondland, described him as \u201ca self-made man who had gotten where he was by putting together complex deals.\u201d But he said he remained puzzled about how and why Sondland became entangled in the Ukraine matter.\n\n\u201cThe arc of Gordon\u2019s story is of a guy who\u2019s tremendously successful in everything he touches, reaches for the stars here, and gets in the middle of a little bit of a scandal,\u201d Bergstein said.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writers Lorne Cook in Brussels, Eugene Johnson in Seattle, Brian Slodysko in Washington and Andrew Selsky in Portland, Oregon, contributed to this report.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 An envoy wrapped up in a congressional impeachment inquiry was a late convert to President Donald Trump, initially supporting another", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/08/b7a190_trump-impeachment-ambassador-60211-donald-trump-gordon-sondland-in-10-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
