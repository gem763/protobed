It was a particularly violent mass arrest even by Hong Kong standards, where four months of mass anti-government protest have become increasingly turbulent.\n\n\u201cI was there for the teargas and then as everyone started leaving the raptors came in and I just saw black-clad people shoving people to the ground. In the middle of that someone grabbed me by the shoulder and I thought, \u2018I\u2019m just going to keep moving. I\u2019m going to keep running,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nAnna, who has actively participated in protests for the past two years, followed a group of other frontline protesters to safety where they quickly changed from the all-black uniform of Hong Kong protesters into street clothes and tried to look like a \u201cforeigner walking around\u201d.\n\nThe twenty-something Swede is one of a handful of foreigners of European descent, a group still deeply privileged in the former British colony, who participates on the front line of conflicts between police and protesters.\n\nDespite Hong Kong\u2019s large international and multicultural population, the movement has remained a largely Chinese and local affair with foreigners like Anna participating intermittently, although their presence has been largely welcomed.\n\nMany foreign residents participated in the early days of the protest movement in June, as a legislative bill that would have allowed for residents to stand trial in mainland China set off a wave of political anger. On record weekends, 1 and 2 million people participated in mass marches, according to organiser figures, while foreign organisations like the American Chamber of Commerce spoke out against the bill.\n\nAs the weeks have dragged on and arrests have climbed to 2,000 at unsanctioned protests, visible foreigners have become harder to spot beyond the occasional curious onlooker or tourist.\n\nThis might get harder after Hong Kong\u2019s Carrie Lam imposed emergency legislation to ban face masks.\n\nTheir presence, however, is not without its complications. Chinese state media has accused the Hong Kong protests of being orchestrated by \u201cblack hands\u201d from the US and western Europe, while online notable foreigners have been accused of working for the CIA.\n\nWho or what is western can be hard to pin down in a society like Hong Kong, where many residents have multiple passports or may have spent a considerable amount of time overseas and considered themselves somewhere between Asian and western.\n\nDue to Hong Kong\u2019s colonial background, however, white residents, whether born in the city or outside of it, nevertheless continue to experience disproportionate privilege despite representing less than 1 per cent of the population, according to the 2016 census.\n\n'I could say my presence at protests brings up all kinds of postcolonial weirdness and/or issues of espionage, therefore I shouldn\u2019t go but that would please the government\n\nTierney\n\nThey stand out in particular from other residents born abroad, particularly those from south or southeast Asia, who face systemic discrimination even after living in Hong Kong for decades and learning to speak Cantonese.\n\nConcerns about Hong Kong\u2019s postcolonial baggage may be on the minds of many would-be protesters, but there are more mundane concerns as well such as the fear of drawing the attention of an employer or immigration authorities by simply standing out more easily.\n\nWhile many foreigners have permanent residency status, similar to a US green card, getting arrested and charged with illegal assembly or rioting is uncharted territory in what has been a largely peaceful city for the past few decades.\n\nMajor multinationals, key foreign employers in Hong Kong, have come under increasing pressure to either condemn the violence of the protest movement or signal their loyalty to Beijing, with pressure extending down the line to employees\u2019 public participation and social media posting.", "description": "Anna sits on the sidewalk after a particularly violent day of Hong Kong protests, recounting how she narrowly escaped arrest last Sunday after riot police surprised a large group of protesters occupying a major road of the government district.After dozens of rounds of tear gas were fired from behind", "authors": ["Erin Hale"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.AMXWb6jJeqFVxP75IcAug--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/84f5a2d523669e9b4f06b01a7b81d462", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
