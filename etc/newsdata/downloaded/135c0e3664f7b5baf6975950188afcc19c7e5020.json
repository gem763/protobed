Another testimony\n\nA national security official who listened to President Donald Trump's July phone call with the Ukrainian president is expected to tell House impeachment investigators he was so troubled by what he heard that he reported his concerns to a White House lawyer.\n\n\"I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\" says Lt. Col Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council's Director of European Affairs, in a copy of his opening remarks obtained by ABC News.\n\nVindman's expected testimony today comes as House Democrats say there will be a vote Thursday on a resolution outlining the next steps in the impeachment inquiry amid criticism from Trump and Republicans who have blasted their handling of the investigation.\n\n\"This is the latest sign that they're moving into a new phase in this inquiry,\" ABC News' Benjamin Siegel tells \"Start Here\" today. \"They're ready to bring it out from behind closed doors into the public eye.\"\n\n2.
