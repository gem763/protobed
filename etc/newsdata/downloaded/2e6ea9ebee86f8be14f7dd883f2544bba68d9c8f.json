Most people already have trouble calculating the basis of an asset sold. Just think how difficult it would be if an index factor was added. Also please don't tell me it will be simple. By the time Congress got finished marking up the bill it would be virtually unreadable.\n\nPerhaps a more realistic approach would be to have rates for different holding periods. For example:\n\n1) Less that one year = ordinary rates\n\n2) 1 year to under 3 years = 20%\n\n3) 3 years to under 6 years = 15%\n\n4) 6 years to under 9 years = 10%\n\n5) 9 years and over = 5%\n\nI would also like to see a change in the way that distributions for 401k and Traditional IRAs are taxed. I would like to see a set percentage of the distribution taxed as long term capital gains.\n\nCapital", "description": "Trump supports Cruz's effort on this. - 20269", "authors": ["Explorer", "Participant"], "top_image": "https://zwcdr85544.i.lithium.com/html/assets/favicon.ico?15D4DC4041FDD3CD56F6121736C9C68D"}
