At half-time Bulgaria captain Ivelin Popov pleaded with a section of the home support to stop the abuse.\n\nEngland chiefs called on UEFA officials to launch a full investigation following the match and now UEFA have confirmed charges - against both national governing bodies.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe Bulgaria FA have been charged over the 'Racist behaviour' of their fans.\n\nThey have also been hit after supporters threw objects and disrupted the national anthem. They've also been charged for showing replays on the big screen at the stadium.\n\nThe English FA have been hit with two charges, after fans booed the national anthem and for an \"insufficient number of travelling stewards.\"\n\n(Image: Andy Commins / Daily Mirror)\n\nA UEFA statement confirmed: \"Disciplinary proceedings have been opened following the UEFA European Qualifiers match between Bulgaria and England (0-6), played on 14 October.\n\nCharges against Bulgarian Football Union:\n\n- Racist behaviour (chants, Nazi salutes) - Art. 14 of the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations (DR)\n\n- Throwing of objects - Art. 16 (2) (b) DR\n\n- Disruption of national anthem - Art. 16 (2) (g) DR\n\n- Replays on giant screen - Art. 42 of the UEFA Safety and Security Regulations\n\nCharges against English Football Association:\n\n- Disruption of national anthem - Art. 16 (2) DR\n\n- Insufficient number of travelling stewards - Art. 24 (2) of the UEFA Safety and Security Regulations\n\nThe case will be dealt with by the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body with the date of the meeting yet to be confirmed.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: VASSIL DONEV/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nUEFA have been heavily criticised for what occurred in Sofia on Monday night, having previously handed out tame sanctions to the Bulgarian FA following racist actions from supporters at matches.\n\nThe Vasil Levski National Stadium was already operating at a reduced capacity after UEFA ordered a section of 5,000 seats to be closed after fans were found guilty of racist behaviour during their June qualifiers against Kosovo and the Czech Republic.\n\n(Image: Internet Unknown)\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin had released a statement in which he vowed to 'eliminate the disease of racism\u2019.\n\nCeferin, who also defended UEFA\u2019s approach to fighting racism, declared: \u201cThere were times, not long ago, when the football family thought that the scourge of racism was a distant memory. The last couple of years have taught us that such thinking was, at best, complacent.\n\n\u201cThe rise of nationalism across the continent has fuelled some unacceptable behaviour and some have taken it upon themselves to think that a football crowd is the right place to give voice to their appalling views.\n\n\"As a governing body, I know we are not going to win any popularity contests. But some of the views expressed about UEFA\u2019s approach to fighting racism have been a long way off the mark.\n\n\u201cUEFA, in close cooperation with the FARE network (Football Against Racism Europe), instituted the three-stage protocol for identifying and tackling racist behaviour during games.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cUEFA\u2019s sanctions are among the toughest in sport for clubs and associations whose supporters are racist at our matches. The minimum sanction is a partial closure of the stadium \u2013 a move which costs the hosts at least hundreds of thousands in lost revenue and attaches a stigma to their supporters.\n\n\u201cUEFA is the only football body to ban a player for ten matches for racist behaviour \u2013 the most severe punishment level in the game.\n\n\u201cBelieve me, UEFA is committed to doing everything it can to eliminate this disease from football. We cannot afford to be content with this; we must always strive to strengthen our resolve.\n\nMore broadly, the football family \u2013 everyone from administrators to players, coaches and fans \u2013 needs to work with governments and NGOs to wage war on the racists and to marginalise their abhorrent views to the fringes of society.\n\n\u201cFootball associations themselves cannot solve this problem. Governments too need to do more in this area.\n\n\u201cOnly by working together in the name of decency and honour will we make progress.\u201d", "description": "England stars were racially abused in Sofia on Monday night and the Bulgarian FA have been hit by four UEFA charges -", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Reuters", "Pa", "Andy Commins", "Daily Mirror", "Getty Images", "Vassil Donev Epa-Efe Rex", "Internet Unknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20580346.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Euro-2020-Qualifier-Group-A-Bulgaria-v-England.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
