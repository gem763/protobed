I think we have similar styles and I think it\u2019s a good fight for me.\u201d\n\nGadelha (17-4 MMA, 6-4 UFC) has struggled to find consistency in the UFC. She\u2019s fought the biggest names in the division, and even challenged for the strawweight title, but fell short to rival Joanna Jedrzejczyk.\n\nHaving trained with Brazil\u2019s Nova Uniao for 10 years, Gadelha decided to make a change around three years ago. After bouncing around a few gyms, she landed in New Jersey, training under the tutelage of coach Mark Henry, and with the likes of former lightweight champion Frankie Edgar.\n\nShe believed she needed to make a change in her approach to the game.\n\n\u201cI had to change my mentality of like the Brazilian brawler that just goes to the gym and beat each other up to an MMA competitor that understands the strategy, and the technique,\u201d Gadelha said. \u201cSo I feel like these last three years, I\u2019ve been going through all of that, and now being with Mark, and Ricardo (Almeida) in New Jersey and spending time with all these amazing fighters I\u2019ve been training with lately, it\u2019s been bringing me back.\u201d\n\nIn her last outing in July, she defeated Randa Markos, and will look to string back to back wins for the first time since 2017.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more motivated now, I feel like I lost that motivation because I was all over the place and I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Gadelha said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I was doing the right thing. I still have that feeling I wanted to win, but I didn\u2019t have that motivation.\u201d\n\nFor more from Gadelha, click on the video linked above.", "description": "Claudia Gadelha believes she levels up when she faces high-level competition, which is what she expects at UFC on ESPN 7.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan", "Simon Head", "Mike Bohn", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/claudia-gadelha-dominance-media-day-2.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
