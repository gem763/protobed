Parker of the Coopertown Police Department told the Smokey Barn News volunteers can request certain types of alcohol in advance of the late June event, but they shouldn't expect any \"top shelf\" drinks.\n\nThe Kutztown Police Department in Pennsylvania recently put out a call seeking three volunteers willing to \"drink to the point of intoxication\" for a similar training exercise. The department said the April 4 event will help teach officers how to administer Standardized Field Sobriety Tests.", "description": "A Tennessee police department is seeking volunteers willing to get drunk for a training exercise, with drinks and transportation provided.", "authors": ["Ben Hooper"], "top_image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/6031550676509/2019/1/e51ab308b3b152f5a1be6135037cc100/v1.5/Tennessee-police-department-needs-drunken-volunteers-for-training.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-20"}
