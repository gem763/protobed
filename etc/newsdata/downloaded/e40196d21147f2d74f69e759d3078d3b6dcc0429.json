So when I hear her say that, there was a point in my life \u2013 I had so many body issues\u2026 and I was looking at women and I thought, 'Why am I looking at women? I must be gay. ' \"\n\nOsmond added that her \"great brothers\" and \"amazing father\" made her change her opinion of men.\n\n\"Truly, they changed my opinion of men, which made me feel that it was something I was going through,\" she said. \"So I'm not saying anything about anybody, I'm saying that with her statement and my life personally, that changed the way I looked at myself.\"\n\nCyrus took to Twitter Monday to clarify her comments in a NSFW tweet. \"I was talking (expletive) about (guys), but let me be clear, YOU don't CHOOSE your sexuality. You are born as you are. It has always been my priority to protect the LGBTQ community I am a part of,\" she wrote, adding a rainbow emoji.\n\nSome on Twitter expressed their dissatisfaction with the singer's comments from the weekend.\n\nOne critic slammed her remarks as \"a stupid message, from a stupid person, to idiots who think they 'have to' become gay because a gender disappoints them. That's a stupid narrative encouraging the illusion that it's a choice and a flimsy button.\"\n\nAnother user made use of the eye roll emoji in their post: \"Miley Cyrus saying 'you don't have to be gay.' \u201c\n\nCyrus, founder of the Happy Hippie Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to providing resources to LGBT youth, homeless citizens and other vulnerable communities, came out as pansexual in 2016.\n\nShe said in Variety's Power of Women L.A. issue that as far as her gender, she feels \"very neutral.\"\n\n\"Once I understood my gender more, which was unassigned, then I understood my sexuality more,\" she said. \"I was like, 'Oh \u2013 that\u2019s why I don\u2019t feel straight and I don\u2019t feel gay. It\u2019s because I\u2019m not.' \"\n\nContributing: Erin Jensen, Jaleesa M.
