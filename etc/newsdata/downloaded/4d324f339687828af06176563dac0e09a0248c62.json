They\u2019ve gotten lighter, thinner, and ridiculously more powerful. But while all of those advancements have been extremely welcome, most gaming laptops are still heavily compromised for non-gaming activities. They tend to have worse keyboards, bad trackpads, and battery life that\u2019s too short to really make them practical away from an outlet for any stretch of time. That doesn\u2019t even go into the fact that most are adorned with obnoxious lighting effects, garish logos, and styling that would make a Gundam blush.\n\nOf all the gaming laptops on the market, Razer\u2019s Blade 15 is perhaps the closest to straddling the line between a powerful gaming computer and an everyday machine. So when it came time to evaluate the latest refresh, which includes Nvidia\u2019s RTX graphics cards, I got my hands on the most conservative-looking model I could get: an entry-level Blade 15 Advanced in the \u201cMercury white\u201d color scheme that sells for $2,349.\n\nWhile this Blade 15 is certainly a capable gaming laptop, it also looks the part of a more traditional computer for productivity work; most people wouldn\u2019t even guess that it\u2019s a full-fledged gaming laptop when they see it. But as I\u2019ve learned by using this computer over the past few weeks, a great everyday laptop needs more than just good looks.\n\nOur review of Razer Blade 15 Advanced (2019) Verge Score 6.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Solid build quality with understated design\n\nGreat high-refresh rate display\n\nPlenty of power for gaming, productivity, or creative work\n\nWindows Hello login and lots of useful ports Bad Stuff Shallow keyboard with frustrating layout quirks\n\nPoor palm rejection on the trackpad\n\nAbysmal battery life\n\nLoud, constant fan noise Buy for $2,299.99 from Razer Buy for $2,299.99 from Amazon\n\nThis year\u2019s version of the Blade 15 Advanced has the exact same design as the model that debuted last year. Its aluminum chassis has sharper edges and a more squared-off appearance than prior Razer laptops, and it has a very small footprint for a 15-inch gaming laptop. At 0.7 inches (17.8mm) thick and 4.56 pounds (2.07 kg), the Blade 15 Advanced is compact and light enough to cart to the office and back every day without much of a burden. You\u2019ll feel the hefty 230W power brick in your bag, however, and you\u2019re not going to want to really travel without it, as I\u2019ll get into later.\n\nThe Mercury white version (which is really just a light silver) is a little more understated than the traditional matte black Razer laptop. It trades the glowing three-headed snake logo on the laptop\u2019s lid for an unilluminated version, and the finish is far less prone to picking up fingerprints than the black model. This is the only gaming laptop I\u2019ve used that doesn\u2019t scream \u201cI\u2019m a gamer!\u201d in its design, and it\u2019s the only one that isn\u2019t embarrassing to use in front of clients or executives. The silver color carries a $50 premium over the standard black, which I don\u2019t fully understand, given it drops the illuminated logo, but if I were already spending this much on a laptop, I\u2019d probably spring for it anyway.\n\nWhile most gaming laptops have subpar build quality, the Blade 15\u2019s chassis is tight, with no real issues to speak of. It\u2019s a solidly built computer that can hang with the best from Apple and Microsoft in terms of fit and finish.\n\nRazer Blade 15 Advanced specs 8th Gen Intel Core i7-8750H 6 Core (2.2GHz base / 4.1GHz turbo boost)\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 2060 (6GB GDDR6 VRAM)\n\n15.6-inch Full HD 144Hz\n\n512GB SSD (NVMe)\n\n16GB Dual-Channel (8GB x 2) DDR4 2667MHz\n\n0.70 x 9.25 x 13.98 inches / 17.8 x 235 x 355mm\n\n4.56 lbs / 2.07 kg\n\nGamers, of course, are far more concerned with what\u2019s inside that chassis, and the Blade 15 Advanced\u2019s gaming chops are impeccable. The model I\u2019m testing has a six-core Core i7 8th Gen Intel processor, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and an RTX 2060 graphics card. The 15-inch 1080p matte display has a 144Hz refresh rate and covers 100 percent of the sRGB spectrum. As we\u2019ve seen in other gaming laptops with these specs, the Blade 15 Advanced can push most modern games well over 60 fps with all of their graphical settings maxed and will reach over 100 fps in less-demanding titles. Given the high price tag of Nvidia\u2019s RTX graphics cards, the 2060 provides the best balance between value and performance in the lineup and most gamers should be very happy with its capabilities. Should you want more power, the Blade 15 Advanced can be equipped with up to an RTX 2080 Max-Q card and a 9th Gen Core i7 processor.\n\nWhile gamers are often willing to make significant sacrifices in usability to attain the best possible gaming performance, evaluating a laptop for productivity and creative work requires a different set of benchmarks. That is where the Blade 15 Advanced starts to falter.\n\nLet\u2019s start with where the Blade 15 excels. It may be obvious, but the Blade\u2019s gaming-level components make it basically overkill for any productivity or web-based work. I can run as many tabs as I want across as many virtual desktops as I want and switch between them all without the machine ever skipping a beat. Content creators can leverage the Blade\u2019s GPU to accelerate video and photo processing to cut down on how long it takes to complete those tasks.\n\nSimilarly, the high-refresh rate screen is unnecessary for non-gaming work. But that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t greatly appreciated. Everything from cursor movements to scrolling is just so buttery smooth on the Blade 15\u2019s screen that even though I don\u2019t game often, I want this kind of screen on every device I use. It\u2019s also plenty bright enough for use in office environments, coffee shops, co-working spaces, or anywhere else you might need to do work.\n\nThe Blade 15 has other creature comforts that make working on it more pleasant, like its abundance of USB-A ports and video outputs that allow me to leave all of my dongles at home or the Windows Hello-compatible webcam that lets me log in without having to type a password. The speakers are loud and clear, which is great for taking calls from the laptop.\n\nBut while the Blade 15 excels in some areas, it disappoints in many others. The speakers may be loud, but they have to be in order to drown out the laptop\u2019s fans, which are a constant companion at the laptop\u2019s default settings, even when I\u2019m doing relatively \u201clight\u201d work.\n\nThe Blade 15\u2019s keyboard looks fine at first glance, with its per-key backlighting and spacious layout. But even with weeks of using it, I could never become accustomed to the shallow travel of the keys, or the frustrating placement of the arrow keys. I\u2019m constantly selecting text when I intend to type a question mark because the up arrow is to the left of the right shift key, where the forward slash / question mark key is on every other keyboard. It\u2019s not a keyboard that I enjoy typing on, and typing words is a huge part of my workday.\n\nThe Blade\u2019s glass trackpad is smooth and spacious and supports multifinger gestures, but it has poor palm rejection, which causes the cursor to jump around the screen erratically whenever I type.\n\nLastly, the real deal-breaker to using the Blade 15 as an everyday laptop for me is its very poor battery life. Gaming laptops have never had great battery life, with even the best options hitting just five or six hours between charges. The Blade 15 isn\u2019t even that good: with my standard workflow of browsing the web, using Slack, checking email, writing Word documents, watching YouTube videos, and the occasional video chat, the battery lasted an average of three hours between charges across the weeks I\u2019ve been testing the Blade, a far cry from the \u201cup to 6 hours\u201d Razer advertises. (That\u2019s with the display set to about half brightness and Windows 10\u2019s power slider set to better battery life.)\n\nMost gamers would not take issue with any of the things I\u2019ve pointed out, but when Razer is charging as much as it is for the Blade 15 lineup, it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect a little more from the machine. After all, if performance was the only thing I was concerned about, there are plenty of other gaming laptops out there that match or exceed the Blade 15\u2019s performance and do it with even lighter designs and much lower price tags. Even Microsoft\u2019s Surface Book 2, which is more of a regular computer that can also play games as opposed to a gaming laptop that can also do work, offers a bit more bang for the buck than Razer.\n\nSo while I love the looks of the Blade 15 Advanced, especially in the Mercury white finish, and I adore the power on tap and the buttery-smooth display, it\u2019s not a computer I can really recommend for anything other than gaming.", "description": "Of all the gaming laptops on the market, Razer\u2019s Blade 15 Advanced in \"Mercury white\" is the least \"gamer\"-looking one you can get.
