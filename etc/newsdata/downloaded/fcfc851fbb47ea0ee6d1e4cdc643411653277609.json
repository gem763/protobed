Reyes finished him in less than two minutes.\n\nThat would seem to preclude Weidman from light heavyweight rankings. Then there\u2019s the fact that while Weidman has been defiant in the fight\u2019s aftermath, even UFC president Dana White says the pride of Long Island should only be considering retirement or a move back to middleweight.\n\nWith Weidman apparently not considering ending his career, back to middleweight it is.\n\nBut then there\u2019s another uncomfortable fact: Weidman\u2019s loss to Reyes was his fifth knockout in his past six fights, with the other four coming at 185. He does have a nice win over a legit foe in Kelvin Gastelum in that stretch, but that\u2019s his only win since he defeated Vitor Belfort in 2015.\n\nWith that, we\u2019ve decided to keep him in the middleweight rankings at No. 10.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only fight of consequence coming out of Boston, so to see where your favorite \u2014 or least favorite \u2014 fighter might currently rank, scroll up to the rankings above and click on his or her division from the drop-down menu.", "description": "Chris Weidman's fifth loss in his past six fights left more questions than answers.", "authors": ["Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Samano", "Abbey Subhan", "The Blue Corner", "Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "Dan Tom", "Simon Head"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/chris-weidman-ufc-boston.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
