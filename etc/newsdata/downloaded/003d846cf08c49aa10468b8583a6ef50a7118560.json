Thousands of people are estimated to have died in the bombings, designed to sow terror among the civilian population.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch the moment Roger Calver, a World War Two evacuee, returned to his wartime home\n\nAfter the attack, ordered by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, Britain gave Germany an ultimatum to cease military operations.\n\nWhen the ultimatum was ignored, Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September, igniting a six-year conflict that would kill tens of millions of people.\n\nHow is the anniversary being marked?\n\nThree commemorative events were held on Sunday in Warsaw, Wielun and the former military post of Westerplatte, in the coastal city of Gdansk.\n\nIn Westerplatte, where Nazi German battleships attacked a Polish military base on 1 September 1939, Mr Morawiecki and European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans attended a dawn remembrance.\n\nAt the same time, Mr Steinmeier pleaded for \"forgiveness\" at a ceremony held in the Polish city of Wielun, where the first German bombs of the conflict fell.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A view of rubble and ruined buildings covering the streets after the German bombing of Warsaw, Poland\n\nAt the ceremony, which began shortly after 04:00 (02:00 GMT), a minute's silence was observed in memory of the victims.\n\nLater in Warsaw, international leaders rang a bell of peace and laid wreathes at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a central memorial in the Polish capital.\n\nWho is attending?\n\nIn all, around 40 foreign delegations were expected to join the commemorations, according to the Polish presidency. They include German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe.\n\nBut world leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin, US President Donald Trump, France's Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson were not present.\n\nMr Trump had been due to attend but cancelled the visit abruptly, sending Mr Pence in his place, as the US east coast braced for Hurricane Dorian.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Leaders and officials attend the commemorative ceremony in Warsaw\n\nMr Putin was not invited, unlike 10 years ago, when he attended commemorations remembering the estimated 600,000 Soviet soldiers killed driving out the Nazis.\n\nBut on this occasion, Poland changed the criteria, inviting from Europe only members of the European Union or its Eastern Partnership (which includes six former Soviet countries).\n\nRelations between Russia and Poland, always strained by the legacy of Soviet domination after the war, have plummeted since Russia annexed Crimea.\n\nMaria Zakharova, spokeswoman for Russia's foreign ministry, called the decision not to invite Mr Putin \"stupid\".", "description": "Frank-Walter Steinmeier is attending ceremonies in Poland to mark the outbreak of World War Two.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07m5zqw.jpg"}
