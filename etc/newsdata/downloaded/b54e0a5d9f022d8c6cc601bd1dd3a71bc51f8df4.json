Every president is entitled to candid advice. But presidents are also entitled to advisers who devote their energies to advancing the boss\u2019s agenda, not to stymieing it.\n\nHe disserved the country by attempting to disguise the truth about the Trump presidency. His bureaucratic maneuvers may have prevented foreign policy fiascoes in North Korea, Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere, at least for the time being. But presidents usually get their way in foreign policy, especially if re-elected. By sparing Americans from the consequences of Trump\u2019s impulses, Bolton has made re-election likelier \u2014 and, in all likelihood, the very outcomes he labored to prevent.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bret Stephens", "Nytimes.Com Opinion John-Bolton-Fired.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
