Kavanaugh \u2014 a claim that was not investigated at the time but has since become public in an upcoming book chronicling the bitter confirmation fight.\n\nSen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) wrote to FBI Director Christopher A. Wray on Oct. 2, 2018, requesting an \u201cappropriate follow up\u201d with one individual who had come to Coons with information about Kavanaugh. Although the person\u2019s name was redacted in the one-page letter, a spokesman for Coons confirmed Monday that the individual was Max Stier, a classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s at Yale University who now leads a prominent nonpartisan group in Washington.\n\nIn the letter obtained by The Washington Post, Coons said \u201cseveral individuals\u201d contacted his office who had wanted to share information with federal authorities but said they had \u201cdifficulty reaching anyone who will collect their information.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot speak to the relevance or veracity of the information that many of these individuals seek to provide, and I have encouraged them to use the FBI tip portal or contact a regional FBI field office,\u201d Coons wrote to Wray. But Stier, Coons said, \u201cwas one individual whom I would like to specifically refer to you for appropriate follow up.\u201d\n\nThe FBI promptly acknowledged receiving the letter from Coons, according to his spokesman, Sean Coit. The two top senators on the Judiciary Committee at the time \u2014 Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) \u2014 were copied on Coons\u2019s letter to the FBI.\n\nA spokesman for Grassley, who no longer chairs the Judiciary Committee, said Monday that the senator\u2019s staff was unaware of the specifics of the information Stier had.\n\n\u201cNot only were we not aware of the nature of the information referenced in the report, we had no reason to believe any separate allegation existed,\u201d said the spokesman, Taylor Foy.\n\nAides said Coons wrote the letter because he wanted to get relevant information about credible allegations as quickly as possible to the FBI. When Coons wrote the letter Oct. 2, FBI officials were in the middle of conducting a new, supplemental background check on Kavanaugh \u2014 who was facing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct \u2014 ahead of his confirmation vote.\n\nKavanaugh was confirmed Oct. 6.\n\nStier had also requested to remain confidential, aides said, so Coons wanted to send the information directly to the FBI so sensitive details would not become public.\n\nThe new allegation against Kavanaugh was made public Saturday night in a New York Times report \u2014 which was an excerpt from a forthcoming book about the justice from two of its reporters. Stier, the Yale classmate, said he saw Kavanaugh with his pants down at a party, where friends pushed Kavanaugh\u2019s penis into a young woman\u2019s hand, according to the Times.\n\n[Democratic candidates demand Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment after new allegation in Times piece]\n\nAccording to the book, \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,\u201d the woman involved in the alleged incident has told friends she does not recall it.\n\nThe Post last year confirmed that two intermediaries had relayed such a claim to lawmakers and the FBI. The Post did not publish a story in part because the intermediaries declined to identify the alleged witness and because the woman who was said to be involved declined to comment.\n\nAs the FBI was wrapping up its investigation, the intermediaries working on behalf of Stier delivered his account to agency officials. The intermediaries told The Post last year they had relayed that a classmate of Kavanaugh had witnessed the incident while taking a study break at Yale\u2019s Lawrance Hall, a dorm. They declined to give The Post the classmate\u2019s name.\n\nStier was one of several people who went to Yale at the same time as Kavanaugh who reached out to the FBI last year seeking to provide information, but they were not interviewed, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Coons connection was first reported by Jackie Calmes of the Los Angeles Times, who is also writing a book on Kavanaugh.\n\nDevlin Barrett contributed to this report.", "description": "Sen.
