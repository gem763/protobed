It has lurched between escalation and detente in recent weeks. Trade isn\u2019t the only geopolitical wild card: So are the risks from the U.K.\u2019s coming departure from the European Union and an attack on a major Saudi Arabian oil processing hub that roiled global markets on Monday.\n\nMeantime, U.S. hiring and consumer spending haven\u2019t lost significant momentum, suggesting domestic growth remains solid.\n\nSo Fed officials are making policy decisions one meeting at a time\u2014attempting to provide enough stimulus to keep the economy expanding without promising too much. Officials are also more divided over how to set policy with such an uncertain outlook.\n\nBecause investors already expect a quarter-point Fed rate cut this week, the big question at the meeting is how many officials will pencil in another reduction this year. Markets will watch closely how Mr. Powell frames the outlook at his press conference Wednesday.\n\nInvestors see a roughly 58% probability the Fed will lower rates at least once more this year after this meeting, down from 93% on Aug. 20, according to CME Group.\n\nThe Fed voted to cut rates by a quarter percentage point on July 31 to a range between 2% and 2.25%. The next day, President Trump escalated the trade war with China. Bond yields dropped sharply in August after this and signs of continued weak manufacturing that indicated grimmer growth prospects.\n\nEarlier this month, Chairman Jerome Powell cited Fed policy this year as an important reason the U.S. economy has proved resilient despite increased headwinds.

This would threaten the main pillar of the U.S. economy.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr. Powell cited Fed policy this year as an important reason the U.S. economy has proved resilient despite increased headwinds. Officials pivoted first from raising rates to putting them on hold, and then to cutting them as conditions shifted. His comment implicitly acknowledged how failing to deliver now on markets\u2019 expectations of another rate cut could damage the outlook.\n\nAt the same time, Fed officials are wary of predicting how many rate cuts will be needed when most believe geopolitical risks, rather than economic data, are behind recent market tremors.\n\n\u2018When you\u2019re seeing rapid changes in those [trade] policies, it makes me want to\u2026let more cards be dealt and let this play out a little bit more,\u201d said Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan in an interview last month. \u201cIt\u2019s wise to shorten up on the prognostication, because there\u2019s just greater uncertainty.\u201d\n\nThe arguments for cutting interest rates haven\u2019t much changed since July. Global manufacturing has stayed soft. The trade war has worsened. And revisions to U.S. economic data suggest the expansion was on a slower track than previously thought.\n\nLikewise, the case against cutting rates is the same as at the last meeting. There are few signs the manufacturing slowdown has fueled a broader pullback in the larger services sector or in consumer spending. The pace of monthly job growth has slowed. But it has been strong enough to hold unemployment down, and measures of prices and wages have firmed.\n\nMr. Powell faced resistance to the July rate cut from around half of the Fed\u2019s 12 reserve bank presidents. Two of them with a vote on the Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee dissented in favor of holding rates steady and could do so again this week.\n\nLarge moves in the bond market underscore the uncertain outlook. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note, which stood at 2.02% after the Fed announced its rate cut on July 31, fell as low as 1.47% two weeks ago before rising sharply last week. They closed at 1.85% on Monday.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What would you like to hear from Mr. Powell regarding the Fed\u2019s policies and/or rate cuts? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe rebound in yields could weaken the argument for a larger, half-point rate cut from officials who had been nervous that the decline had signaled a deterioration in investors\u2019 expectations for growth and inflation.\n\nSustained declines in market-determined rates would suggest the so-called neutral interest rate that neither spurs nor slows growth has fallen.\n\n\u201cThe risk is they are falling behind the decline in [neutral rates] a little bit,\u201d said Joachim Fels, global economic adviser at bond-fund firm Pacific Investment Management Co. \u201cThis means they have to be running just to stand still. I think they eventually will catch up, but they will take some time.\u201d\n\nIn July, Mr. Powell described the Fed\u2019s turn toward rate cuts as a \u201cmid-cycle adjustment,\u201d a phrase intended to draw parallels to two separate episodes in 1995 and 1998 when the Fed cut rates three times over several months. Both times, the expansion continued.\n\nMr. Powell said officials didn\u2019t believe they were beginning a longer series of rate cuts, and he repeated again two weeks ago that the central bank wasn\u2019t forecasting a recession.\n\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com", "description": "Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is leading his colleagues to cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point at their meeting this week, for the second time in as many months.", "authors": ["Nick Timiraos", "Nick.Timiraos Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-94653/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
