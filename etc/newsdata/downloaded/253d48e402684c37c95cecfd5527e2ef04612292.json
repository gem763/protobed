The attack also likely will heighten tensions further across the wider Persian Gulf amid a confrontation between the U.S. and Iran over its unraveling nuclear deal with world powers. The Houthis are backed by Tehran amid a yearslong Saudi-led war against them in Yemen.\n\nHamad I Mohammed / Reuters Smoke is seen following a fire at an Aramco factory in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia.\n\nOnline videos apparently shot in Buqyaq included the sound of gunfire in the background. Smoke rose over the skyline and glowing flames could be seen a distance away at the Abqaiq oil processing facility.\n\nSaudi state television later aired a segment with a correspondent there as smoke from the blazes clearly rose behind. That smoke also was visible from space. The fires began after the sites were \u201ctargeted by drones,\u201d the Interior Ministry said in a statement carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency. It said an investigation into the attack was underway.\n\nIn a short address aired by the Houthi\u2019s Al-Masirah satellite news channel, military spokesman Yahia Sarie said the rebels launched 10 drones in their coordinated attack on the sites. He warned attacks by the rebels would only get worse if the war continues.\n\n\u201cThe only option for the Saudi government is to stop attacking us,\u201d Sarie said.\n\nSaudi Aramco, the state-owned oil giant, did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press. The kingdom hopes soon to offer a sliver of the company in an initial public offering. Saudi Aramco describes its Abqaiq oil processing facility in Buqyaq as \u201cthe largest crude oil stabilization plant in the world.\u201d\n\n- via Getty Images This AFPTV screen grab from a video shows smoke billowing from an Aramco oil facility in Abqaiq.\n\nThe facility processes sour crude oil into sweet crude, then later transports onto transshipment points on the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. Estimates suggest it can process up to 7 million barrels of crude oil a day.\n\nThe plant has been targeted in the past by militants. Al-Qaida-claimed suicide bombers tried but failed to attack the oil complex in February 2006. The Khurais oil field is believed to produce over 1 million barrels of crude oil a day. It has estimated reserves of over 20 billion barrels of oil, according to Aramco.\n\nThere was no immediate impact on global oil prices as markets were closed for the weekend across the world. Benchmark Brent crude had been trading at just above $60 a barrel. Buqyaq is some 330 kilometers (205 miles) northeast of the Saudi capital, Riyadh.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition has been battling the rebels since March 2015. The Iranian-backed Houthis hold Yemen\u2019s capital, Sanaa, and other territory in the Arab world\u2019s poorest country.\n\nThe war has become the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. The violence has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine and killed more than 90,000 people since 2015, according to the U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or ACLED, which tracks the conflict.\n\nSince the start of the Saudi-led war, Houthi rebels have been using drones in combat. The first appeared to be off-the-shelf, hobby-kit-style drones. Later, versions nearly identical to Iranian models turned up. Iran denies supplying the Houthis with weapons, although the U.N., the West and Gulf Arab nations say Tehran does.\n\nThe rebels have flown drones into the radar arrays of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Patriot missile batteries, according to Conflict Armament Research, disabling them and allowing the Houthis to fire ballistic missiles into the kingdom unchallenged. The Houthis launched drone attacks targeting Saudi Arabia\u2019s crucial East-West Pipeline in May as tensions heightened between Iran and the U.S. In August, Houthi drones struck Saudi Arabia\u2019s Shaybah oil field, which produces some 1 million barrels of crude oil a day near its border with the United Arab Emirates.\n\nU.N. investigators said the Houthis\u2019 new UAV-X drone, found in recent months during the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s war in Yemen, likely has a range of up to 1,500 kilometers (930 miles).\n\nThat puts the far reaches of both Saudi Arabia and the UAE in range.", "description": "Yemen's Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attacks in Buqyaq and the Khurais oil field.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7cbef63b0000039fd30f51.jpeg?cache=k3nq8nlmov&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
