Granit is like a brother to me,\u2019 he told Swiss publication Blick.\n\n\u2018I understand that he did not react well to the booing but if you are a true fan of your club it is like a love affair.\n\n\u2018You have to be there for each other in the bad times as well as the good. There should be no place for booing your own players.\n\n\u2018I spoke on the phone to Granit after the game. He\u2019s not in a good place \u2013 he is grief-stricken.\n\n\u2018He regretted his actions straight away. He is an emotional person.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nDibrani hit out at the Arsenal fans who \u2018abused\u2019 Xhaka at the Emirates and believes the criticism the midfielder has received on social media has been \u2018below the belt\u2019.\n\n\u2018The fans and the English media are quick to bury him. He is at an age when he can make mistakes, and only human\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018I think the fans who slaughter him are tourists. They are not genuine supporters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Granit does everything for his football. He had a personal trainer, and missed out on partying.\n\n\u2018Then he gets abused in the stadium and on social media. The comments are below the belt.\n\n\u2018At Basel he was an undisputed first-teamer aged 18, and he was Borussia Monchengladbach\u2019s youngest ever captain.\n\n\u2018Now he gets slaughtered without mercy. It is not fair.\n\n\u2018Swiss people have to be proud that one of us is captain of one of the world\u2019s biggest clubs but the blame for Arsenal\u2019s entire situation is being placed on Granit\u2019s shoulders.\n\n\u2018I am a Manchester United fan, and both they and Arsenal have been off the top of English football for five or six years.\n\n\u2018Both clubs are simply not as good as Liverpool or Manchester City.\u2019\n\nMORE: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang sends message of unity amid Granit Xhaka controversy", "description": "Granit Xhaka's best mate has lifted the lid on their phone call after the midfielder told Arsenal fans to 'f*** off' during the side's 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace.
