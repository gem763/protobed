Wilson / Getty\n\nExperts recommend saving about 10%-15% of your income each month, but the average American saves more like 3.5%.\n\nTo figure out how much you should have saved for retirement at any age, Fidelity provided estimated benchmarks based on earnings. In your 30s, you should have 1x your salary saved, based on these estimates.\n\nVisit BusinessInsider.com for more stories.\n\nSaving money is easier said than done.\n\nBut there\u2019s no way around it: To set yourself up for a secure financial future, you have to have money in the bank.\n\nFor most people, having a little cash leftover each month is doable. After taxes and expenses, the average American manages to put away 3.5% of their income, according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nThat\u2019s better than nothing, but to get to the expert-recommended 10% or 15% each month, you have to put in effort.\n\nNeed a better place to keep your savings? Consider these offers from our partners:\n\nAt times \u2013 like when you are between jobs or are dealing with expensive medical bills \u2013 saving money won\u2019t be possible, no matter how hard you try. And that\u2019s okay.\n\nBut sometimes, you know you could be saving more than you are. That\u2019s when it\u2019s worth taking a hard look at your spending habits, and cutting back in some areas so you can direct more money to your 401(k), IRA, emergency fund \u2013 or all of the above.\n\nIf you need motivation to kick your goals into gear, check out Fidelity\u2019s recommended retirement savings benchmarks in the chart below.\n\nsource Mike Nudelman/Business Insider\n\nKeep in mind, these are just guidelines. If you\u2019re behind on saving for retirement, you can always take steps today or in the future to catch up as much as possible.\n\nAnd, there is good news. You don\u2019t have to save every penny of the amounts above to get to your goal.\n\nYour savings will grow exponentially if you invest the money you save. Investing can be risky \u2013 sometimes your account balances will dip. But as long as you don\u2019t need the money when it does (and if you\u2019re far from retirement, you won\u2019t), then you have plenty of time to enjoy the flip side of the coin: when the stock market is soaring.\n\nIn fact, missing out on stock market growth spurts is actually riskier than not investing at all.\n\nBy saving a bit more today \u2013 and making sure to invest as well \u2013 you can create momentum toward saving even more in the future. It\u2019ll all be worth it when you\u2019re relaxing on a beach during retirement.\n\nHow much could your savings grow?
