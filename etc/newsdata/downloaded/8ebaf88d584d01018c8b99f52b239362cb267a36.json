Might there be some power in appropriating this process \u2014 in self-inducing panic before fate, politics, etc. can do it for us? Not exactly. But from a biological, look-what-the-brain-can-do perspective, this capacity does seem worth investigating. Can someone \u2014 starting, let\u2019s say, from a position of relative peace/contentment \u2014 actually think their way into a full-on panic attack? To find out, for this week\u2019s Giz Asks we reached out to a number of experts in psychology and anxiety disorders.\n\nAssistant Director of the Columbia University Clinic for Anxiety and Related Disorders and Assistant Professor of Medical Psychology (in Psychiatry) at Columbia University Irving Medical Centre\n\nThere are some important concepts to unpack in order to answer this question. (Before doing so, here\u2019s a friendly reminder: don\u2019t try this at home.) When most people use the term \u201cpanic attack\u201d colloquially, they usually mean \u201canxiety attack.\u201d Unlike mounting anxiety or stress, a panic attack typically comes on out of the blue and is associated with a jolt of intense, visceral, and often terrifying anxiety that is characterised by four or more distressing physical sensations (e.g. heart racing, hyperventilation, feeling dizzy, sweating profusely) and extreme concern associated with the interpretation of these symptoms. Panic attacks can be caused by internal triggers, such as hyperawareness or paying too much attention to internal experiences, which might cause someone to misinterpret his heart racing as a sign of a heart attack, or feelings of unreality as a sign that he is \u201cgoing crazy\u201d or will lose control. Anxiety attacks, on the other hand, can be incredibly distressing as they build, but are usually tied to acute stressors (e.g. try to stay calm after losing your keys!) or chronic stressors (e.g. fear of not meeting a deadline). Contrary to what you might think, when we treat panic disorder in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), we actually deliberately bring on simulated panic attacks, or work to induce common symptoms of panic as best as we can during treatment. This practice is called interoceptive exposure and it is fundamental to the treatment and recovery process. By bringing on uncomfortable or feared sensations in the therapy room (say, for example, spinning in a chair to bring on a feeling of dizziness), we are helping individuals with panic symptoms learn to change how they relate to their symptoms; this way, they are no longer experiencing these physical sensations as threatening or dangerous, but instead as uncomfortable, short-lived, and manageable. Bringing on these simulated panic attacks then allows individuals to learn that they are able to tolerate these sensations across settings, that their worst fears do not materialise, and that they can feel these symptoms and still engage in regular and meaningful activities. I often tell my clients that they themselves have unknowingly brought on panic attacks without even realising it! For example, when they choose to ride on a roller coaster or take a cycling class. These activities induce the same symptoms characteristic of panic attacks, but they do not feel inordinately scared in those scenarios, because they know the cause. The difference with panic attacks is that the sudden and often unexpected onset does not always present with a viable or predictable cause, thereby leaving many feeling stunned. To simulate a panic attack, as we do in cognitive behavioural therapy, you could \u201crev up\u201d your body by bringing on a host of acute and unpleasant physical sensations. Although this might not capture the full scope of a panic attack, it would certainly shake things up.\n\n\u201cContrary to what you might think, when we treat panic disorder in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), we actually deliberately bring on simulated panic attacks, or work to induce common symptoms of panic as best as we can during treatment.\u201d\n\nProfessor, Psychology, University of Queensland\n\nIt is quite possible to bring on the symptoms of a panic attack through, for example, deliberate hyperventilation. However, I would say that it would be more difficult to also have the emotional \u201cout of control\u201d panic feelings when you are intentionally producing the symptoms yourself. In fact this technique of deliberate and controlled induction of panic symptoms is sometimes incorporated into a cognitive behaviour therapy for panic disorder to help the person experience the distinction between the symptoms and their response to the symptoms. It also can be used to demonstrate that symptoms can be controlled by combining the hyperventilation with slow diaphragmatic breathing. This tends to reverse symptoms brought on by the self-induced hyperventilation and helps to give the person a sense of efficacy and control over their symptoms.\n\n\u201c...people with a tendency to panic have different baseline breathing rates than people who don\u2019t have a history of panic attacks.\u201d\n\nAssistant Professor of Psychiatry at the Centre for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety at Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania\n\nIn 1987, a study was conducted called the Carbon Dioxide Challenge; the idea was to look at ways to induce panic attacks in people who were in the laboratory. It turned out that if you had people put on an oxygen mask, and altered the formula in the oxygen machine so that there was slightly more carbon dioxide than normal, most people would have a panic attack. This is important, because it suggests a strong correlation between disruptions in breathing and panic. One of the things we\u2019ve found in many different research studies is that breathing disruptions are really the quintessential feature of panic attacks \u2014 that sense of hyperventilation, of not being able to catch one\u2019s breath, is the feature most often reported by people with panic disorders. Related to that, a researcher named Alicia Meuret, at Southern Methodist University, did some research in the early-to-mid \u201800s showing that people with a tendency to panic have different baseline breathing rates than people who don\u2019t have a history of panic attacks. So the idea is that you can make just about anybody have a panic attack, or symptoms that resemble one, if you make them hyperventilate for long enough. And in fact this is an important part of treating panic attacks: by bringing on some sensations that resemble panic attacks, through strategies like hyperventilation, people can learn that the symptoms themselves aren\u2019t dangerous.\n\nMental health researcher at the University of Cambridge, whose research focuses on anxiety and depression\n\nYes, it is possible to do this. First of all, to briefly define a panic attack: it is a rapid crescendo of intense anxiety that peaks within minutes. You might feel like you are about to have a heart attack, go crazy, lose control, or die. You might also experience symptoms like heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and dizziness. Sometimes panic attacks arise out of the blue \u2014 for no reason \u2014 other times, they are triggered by specific events or situations. So can you bring on a panic attack on your own? Yes, you can do so if you start thinking about your worries. This is especially the case if you are prone to anxiety, and you start catastrophising or thinking about the various ways that things might go wrong in the future and how you are going to fix them. This exercise may seem useful to you, because you are figuring out how to avert potential problems \u2014 this is commonly done by many people with anxiety. But thinking about worries and future problems can lead to a downward spiral \u2014 one worry can lead to a second, and then to a third, and before you know it, a panic attack can take hold. Interestingly, recent research has also linked negative mood with anxiety. Studies have shown that being in a negative mood can make you more prone to generalised anxiety disorder, which is characterised by excessive, oftentimes uncontrollable worrying, among other symptoms. And having generalised anxiety disorder can make it more likely that you develop panic attacks in the future. So essentially, the mood you are in right now can serve as a trigger for later panic attacks. Sometimes we choose the moods we are in, while other times they seem to just take hold of us and there is nothing we can do to escape them. So in those particular instances when we choose to remain in a negative state, then that can be a possible risk factor for a future panic attack.\n\n\u201cStudies have shown that being in a negative mood can make you more prone to generalized anxiety disorder, which is characterised by excessive, oftentimes uncontrollable worrying, among other symptoms.\u201d\n\nProfessor Emeritus, Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences, Stanford University\n\nIt depends on whether or not you have had panic attacks. If you have, it is possible to bring one on by hyperventilating, (or sometimes spinning around) remembering previous situations/thoughts that may have precipitated one or going to places where you know you are likely to have one etc. However, most panic attacks just come out of the blue. If you are not prone to panic, it is pretty much impossible to bring one on, even by hyperventilating.\n\nClinical Assistant Professor, Psychiatry, NYU Langone Medical Centre\n\nI\u2019ve seen folks bring about anxiety attacks by worrying themselves into it \u2014 ruminating, what-if thinking, catastrophising, assuming the worst case scenario happening. It often happens at night, though it can happen anytime. People have insomnia; and when things quiet down outside at night, but the tape is still playing in their heads, they get out of bed and start pacing. Some people dry heave or vomit, out of panic.\n\n\u201cPanic attacks can be triggered but few people would want to bring them on voluntarily and if you experience panic attacks in your life it\u2019s best to accept them or seek professional help in coping with them, rather than getting stuck in worrying about them or starting to live a limited life because of the fear they will return.\u201d\n\nAssistant Professor and Director of the Program for Anxiety Disorders at the Child Study Centre of the Yale School of Medicine", "description": "Aids to relaxation are ubiquitous, abundant: breathing techniques, benzodiazepines, ASMR, mood music, herbals teas, exercise, heavy drinking.
