Addressing a crowded meeting organised by Creasy to discuss a fightback against the emergence of CBR UK in her constituency, Khan confirmed that \u201charassment and targeting\u201d was something that \u201cpossibly goes beyond\u201d the bounds of lawful protest.\n\nDS Matthew Hearing, a public order officer who investigated the targeting of MP Anna Soubry by far-right supporters last year, confirmed police had taken a detailed statement from the MP. He asked the audience if they had any footage or material relating to two recent protests by CBR UK in Walthamstow as well as a billboard that was put up showing an aborted foetus and the words \u201cStop Stella\u201d.\n\nHearing added: \u201cI would like to collect as much evidence as possible, and anybody here who took photographs or were present during previous demonstrations, then please pass them forward, that would be greatly appreciated.\u201d\n\nIf they were making homophobic remarks on their posters, it would not be a matter of debate that it had to be taken down Stella Creasy\n\nThe Met\u2019s intervention followed a tumultuous week in Creasy\u2019s constituency during which the divisive billboard was daubed with white paint before being pulled down by council officials. Creasy lodged complaints with the police, the Speaker of the Commons and the home secretary.\n\nCreasy told Saturday\u2019s meeting at Walthamstow Trades Hall that the actions of the anti-abortion protestors were not just an attack on her, but \u201ccollective harassment\u201d against the women of Walthamstow.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt shows the gaps in the law that if they were showing pictures of the KKK, or making homophobic remarks on their posters, it would not be a matter of debate that it had to be taken down. We have to show that this is a form of harassment.\u201d\n\nShe urged those present to report harassment to the council and police.\n\nAnother speaker was Dr Pam Lowe from Aston University, an expert in reproductive health, who has studied the Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform in the US and described it as promoting \u201cshock tactics.\u201d She said the group had previously targeted the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau in a similar way to Creasy over the Canadian prime minister\u2019s pro-choice position.\n\nLowe added that the group\u2019s strategy was aimed at ensuring phrases such as \u201cbaby murderer\u201d became normalised, warning that such tactics had the potential to radicalise individuals and had incited violence in the US.\n\nOne member of the audience said she had registered a complaint with the Met last week that the anti-abortion protests constituted \u201cgendered hate crime\u201d, although Hearing pointed out that \u201cto be insulted by something is not a crime\u201d.\n\nAnother said the actions of the group were \u201cdebasing our political fabric\u201d and described the tactics as \u201cextremist\u201d and \u201cclearly gendered harassment\u201d.", "description": "Pregnant, pro-choice Labour MP subject to intense campaigning in her London constituency", "authors": ["Mark Townsend"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a20c0fc8cdd02a65b52753437db617fddcd9c1b7/0_261_5047_3028/master/5047.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cd268af6ca01d395fc5915f4aef61e98", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
