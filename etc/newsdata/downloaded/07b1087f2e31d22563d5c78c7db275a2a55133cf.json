The yields for the 2-month Treasury and the 10-year Treasury have inverted, a big red flag for a looming recession.\n\nAs Markets Insider's Carmen Reineke reported last week: Investors are \"struggling to find solid returns in an environment where yields are low all around.\" The yield curve's inversion \u2014 which has come before every recession since 1950 \u2014 \"has increased investor panic,\" she wrote. \"That, in turn, has driven the bond rally further and dragged yields lower.\"\n\nSee More: The yield curve is inverted. Here's what that means, and what the implications are for the economy.\n\nAdded Wilson: \"Real yields in the US have fallen to about zero which has made gold especially appealing given that the opportunity cost to holding gold as a hedge is about zero.\"\n\n\"So while sometimes you see gold as a safe haven play, it doesn't really work or last when yields are higher \u2013 the drop in yields has really been the key.\"\n\nInvestors have also been putting their money into bitcoin for similar reasons, according to analysts at eToro. The e-trading platform said it saw a 284% surge in bitcoin trades in the last three months, compared to the three months before that.\n\nSee More: Investors have been plowing money into bitcoin since the start of the US-China trade war", "description": "Worried investors are plowing into gold due to global uncertainty in markets.\u00a0 Meanwhile, global trade has continued to slow down due to the trade wa...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d6d23b52e22af67e04e37e7-2400/rtr3a9d0.jpg"}
