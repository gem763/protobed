Green has not yet commented on the suit.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe situation is similar to one Jerry Seinfeld recently got into when he auctioned a 1958 Porsche 356 A 1500 GT/GS-- later found to be bogus --for $1.54 million and that he now claims in a lawsuit was originally sold to him under false pretenses.\n\nGreen had long been an avid classic car collector and sometime racer, but told People magazine earlier this year that he started selling some of them, including the Porsche, in favor of more practical cars to accommodate his growing family, which includes wife Megan Fox, their three young children and a 17-year-old son from a previous relationship.\n\nOLDEST 'PORSCHE' FAILS TO SELL AFTER AUCTION HOUSE'S $70 MILLION MISTAKE", "description": "Not as advertised suit claims.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
