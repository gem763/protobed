I have lost weight, therefore I have willpower. I am, it is concluded, morally superior to those who have not; I have some quality they don\u2019t.\n\nWe seem to want the world to be a lot more straightforward than it is. We want \u201cgoodies\u201d and \u201cbaddies\u201d. We want rights and and wrongs that allow us to make simple judgements. But life just isn\u2019t like that.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nI used to weigh 25 stone \u2013 that\u2019s 350lb. It took me a lot of emotional and psychological work to get to the point where I was ready to lose weight. And it still takes a lot of work to keep doing it. And the reality is that I often fail. I went on holiday recently, came off my plan and gained 11lb. So do I still have this famed moral quality of \u201cwillpower\u201d? Or am I now, once again, one of the feckless and fat?\n\nIt\u2019s this grey area that makes the British Psychological Society report into obesity so interesting. The study looks at genetic and environmental factors that cause obesity, and concludes that a \u201clack of willpower\u201d \u2013 whatever that means \u2013 is not a cause of obesity.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. The best diets: according to the experts Show all 10 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. The best diets: according to the experts 1/10 Flexitarian Diet The combination of flexible and vegetarian. This diet is all about adding things to your diet, not taking them away. By adding more tofu, beans, fruits, veggies, eggs, whole grains and seeds to your diet you should feel full on fewer calories. Flickr / Brian 2/10 DASH Diet Ranked at number one, the DASH diet was developed to prevent and lower high blood pressure by reducing salt intake. Flickr / Dubravko Sori\u0107 3/10 TLC Diet Created to cut high cholesterol and endorsed by the American Heart Association. 4/10 Mayo Clinic diet Focuses on everything you were told to eat as a child: whole grains, fruit and vegetables. Flickr / Rochelle 5/10 Mediterranean Diet Eat as the Mediterranean people do: A diet low in red meat, sugar and saturated fats but high in produce and nuts. And lots of olives. Flickr / Meal Makeover Moms 6/10 Weight Watchers Works with a points system where healthy foods have fewer points. Group meetings offer emotional support and encouragement, meaning it has been a successful program since 1963. Flickr / Mike Mozart 7/10 Volumetrics Diet Works on the idea that people eat roughly the same amount every day, regardless of the calories. So this diet is all about the approach to eating rather than a structured diet. It divides food into four groups depending on their energy density. For example, more veggies on top of pasta instead of cheese. Flickr / Jennifer 8/10 Jenny Craig For encouragement, on this diet you get a meal plan and a counselling session every week with a consultant. You get three meals a day, including French toast, but unfortunately you can\u2019t really go out for meals. Flickr / Dennis Wilkinson 9/10 Biggest Loser Diet Eat regular meals with whole grains, fruit, vegetables and lean protein, get more exercise and keep a food journal. Fairly simple. Flickr / Pete Thomas 10/10 Ornish Diet Developed by Dean Ornish in his 2007 book \u201cThe Spectrum\u201d. He categorizes food in to five groups from most (1) to least (5) healthy. He pinpoints emotional support as a powerful tool for weight loss. Flickr / kris kr\u00fcg 1/10 Flexitarian Diet The combination of flexible and vegetarian.

As I have written before, fat-shaming is nothing more than bullies giving themselves a moral licence to be vile and unhelpful. But I do worry about the way we now talk about willpower, because it\u2019s a complicated thing that deserves better understanding, and a more concrete definition. Instead, we are left with a lazy word weighted with moral judgement that\u2019s still being thrown in the direction of larger people.\n\nThe truth is that willpower is needed to lose weight, but it isn\u2019t a consistent quality. I have had the willpower to lose half my body weight. I also recently ate a sausage sandwich for breakfast and drank beer well into the night. Because I am inconsistent, my willpower is inconsistent.\n\nThe absolutely hardest part about losing weight is going back to a weight loss plan once you have come off it. The sense of failure when you break your diet can be overwhelming. The sense that you might as well stay off the wagon is overwhelming and the emotions that come with that guilt and shame often mean that all you want to do is, quite literally, consume to achieve the short term dopamine hit. Choosing not to do that is willpower; choosing to go back to a diet, having done, that is also willpower. It\u2019s not straightforward.\n\nInstead of dismissing the concept of willpower, we should reclaim it from the bullies. It takes willpower to fail and try again. It takes willpower to get halfway.\n\nI am no one\u2019s concept of thin, yet I have lost the weight of a whole adult human being. It took willpower to get this far, and it will take willpower to get the rest of the way. But when I fail \u2013 and I will fail \u2013 it will not be because of a lack of willpower. It will be willpower that will get me back on track.\n\nI\u2019m human. I don\u2019t work like a machine and I shouldn\u2019t be expected to. We shouldn\u2019t stop talking about willpower or determination, which are essential to anyone\u2019s weight loss journey, but we should remember that everyone on that journey is a human \u2013 and start to treat them accordingly.", "description": "Willpower is a strange and complicated concept \u2013 especially when it comes to losing weight.
