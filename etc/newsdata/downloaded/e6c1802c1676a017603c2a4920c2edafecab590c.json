Apple and Disney launch in November.\n\nIn July, Netflix reported a rare erosion of subscribers. The company in the second quarter lost 126,000 subscribers in the U.S., its first such drop since 2011.\n\nAlso this summer, it lost \u201cThe Office\u201d and \u201cFriends,\u201d two of its most popular shows. \u201cThe Office\u201d will leave at the end of 2020 to join NBCUniversal\u2019s new streaming service, and \u201cFriends\u201d will leave at the beginning of 2020 to join the upcoming HBO Max service.\n\nNetflix is armoring up, recently announcing a five-year deal with Sony Pictures Television for the global streaming rights to \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d the Emmy-winning television comedy which aired its final episode in 1998.\n\nBut the competition is already eating away at shares of Netflix, which have given up the 46% in gains this year.\n\nAt the opening bell, shares of Netflix Inc. slipped more than 1% while broader markets climbed.\n\nInvestors will be watching when Netflix posts third-quarter earnings in three weeks.\n\n\u201cWe generally agree with Netflix\u2019s view that it can thrive in a highly competitive world as long as it justifies its own price,\u201d wrote Andy Hargreaves of KeyBanc Capital Markets. \u201cNonetheless, Disney and Apple bring marketing competency and access to capital that Netflix has never faced directly. This could increase customer acquisition costs and content costs, both of which negatively impact subscriber growth.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Shares of Netflix are opening in negative territory for the year - the first time that's happened since 2016 - as major media players step into the stream to fight for subscribers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/netflix_crowded_stream_20906_c0-180-2878-1858_s1770x1032.jpg?860e42559c01ab33345d5e6808df587a5031e3ac", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
