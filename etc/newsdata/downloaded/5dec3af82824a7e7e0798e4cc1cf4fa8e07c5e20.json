Erik Scott told The Associated Press. The cause remained under investigation.\n\nThe fire that started Thursday night burned more than 12 square miles (31 square kilometers), destroyed 17 structures and damaged dozens more. One man died of a heart attack during the fire in the Porter Ranch neighborhood, officials said.\n\nThe fire department had said Friday that a witness saw sparks or flames coming from a power line near where the fire was believed to have started. At least two people told LA TV stations that they saw fire near power lines above Saddle Ridge Road around the time the blaze broke out.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

But it wasn\u2019t clear Monday if the fire originated in an area that could have had the power shut off pre-emptively.\n\nSoCal Edison declined to comment on the fire\u2019s source. The utility reported to state regulators that its system was affected near the reported location and time of the fire, spokeswoman Susan Cox said.\n\nIt filed the report Friday with the California Public Utilities Commission \u201cout of an abundance of caution,\u201d Cox said. She did not have additional details such as the kind of system, how it was affected or what the effects were.\n\nElectric utilities must file reports in four instances: when there is a fatality or injury that involves electric facilities, when there is damage to property over $50,000, when there is significant media coverage, and when there is a major outage to at least 10% of the service territory at once, said Terrie Prosper, a spokeswoman for the commission.\n\nThe report is confidential and not publicly available, Prosper said.\n\nThe fire erupted Thursday night and was rapidly spread by strong Santa Ana winds.\n\nResidents of Saddle Ridge Road said they fled their homes as gusts drove the flames down the hillside and tossed embers into the neighborhood, lighting trees and setting bushes ablaze.\n\nThe neighborhood is bordered by powerlines strung between large towers.\n\nAttorney Gerald Singleton, who has sued utilities for starting wildfires and has investigators looking into the blaze, said the fire\u2019s origin indicates it was probably caused by SoCal Edison\u2019s equipment.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a fire start that close to a piece of electrical equipment, you know, generally that\u2019s what causes it,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t have any definitive evidence that it was their fault, but \u2026 we\u2019re going to keep looking at it.\u201d\n\nThe fire was 43% contained on Monday.\n\nTo the east in Riverside County, a 1.5-square-mile (3.8-square-kilometer) fire that destroyed dozens of mobile homes and left two people dead last week is fully contained.\n\nThat fire ignited when a garbage truck driver dumped a load that had caught fire.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A fire that exploded on the edge of Los Angeles began beneath a high-voltage transmission tower owned by Southern California Edison", "authors": ["Stefanie Dazio", "Brian Melley"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/california-saddle-ridge-fire.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
