They are juveniles who arrived at the border without a parent. Under the law they are to be quickly processed by Homeland Security and released to the federal Health and Human Services Department, which then places them in dorm-like shelters where they await placement.\n\nUsually they are turned over to family \u2014 often-times illegal immigrants themselves \u2014 living in the U.S., but if no match can be made they are placed in foster homes.\n\nThis is different than the Border Patrol holding facilities that have been in the news earlier this year after reports of overcrowding and unsanitary conditions. Those facilities are only meant to hold children for hours or days, until they can be processed and turned over to the Health Department.\n\nWednesday\u2019s audit looked at 45 of the Health Department facilities and found most did have decent documentation of background checks. But 11 facilities lacked at least some records.\n\nInvestigators said they found 10 employees who\u2019d been working with children for at least a year but who\u2019d not been through an FBI criminal history check. That check is meant to screen out predators or others who might pose dangers to the children.\n\nOne facility wrongly granted its employees a waiver from the FBI check, the audit found.\n\nThe shelters reported to the audit that they\u2019re struggling to hire staff, partly because of the strictness of the background checks.\n\nA majority said they have trouble finding qualified mental health clinicians, too.\n\nLow wages, rough working hours and high hurdles, such as bilingualism, compounded matters.\n\nThe 45 facilities checked in the audit employed a total of nearly 10,250 people\n\nOnly four of the 45 facilities achieved a perfect score on the inspector general\u2019s audit.\n\nInvestigators made nine recommendations to stiffen compliance with background check rules.\n\nThe Health Department agreed to all of them, though it pointed out some of the issues the audit found are beyond its control, such as the difficulty of screening workers who lived out of the U.S. at some point, and for whom criminal background information was tough to find.\n\nBut the department said it\u2019s already taken steps to address issues under its control, including issuing new guidance to the contract-run shelters in March.\n\nNow the shelters are to alert HHS if background checks are becoming a hurdle.\n\nHHS also must give final approval to all hires who have direct access to children, and the department expanded its list of disqualifying crimes to include any kind of crime involving children, any violent crime in the last 10 years, or \u201cany kind of inappropriate sexual behavior.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
