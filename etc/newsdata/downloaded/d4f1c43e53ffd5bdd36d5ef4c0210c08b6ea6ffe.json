The Redskins are famously burgundy and gold, the Capitals tell their fans to \u201crock the red,\u201d the Wizards use it as a secondary color, and the Mystics and Nationals generally wear a red-based uniform.\n\nBut in the 2019 Major League Baseball playoffs, the Nationals seem to have found a good-luck charm in their alternate uniforms.\n\nWhen the Nationals rock navy blue jerseys, not red, they\u2019re 8-0 this postseason.\n\nFans were thrilled to find out that they would wear the navy blues for Game 1 of the World Series Tuesday.\n\n.@Nationals indeed sporting their navy blue uniforms tonight. They are 7-0 this postseason when wearing them. To quote the great Michael Scott and Davey Martinez: \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious. I\u2019m just a little stitious.\u201d \u2014 Monica Alba (@albamonica) October 22, 2019\n\nAnd they were right to be excited. Washington did the improbable and beat Houston\u2019s ace pitcher Gerrit Cole on the way to a 5-4 Game 1 win.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
