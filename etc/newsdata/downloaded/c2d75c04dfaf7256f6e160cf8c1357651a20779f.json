As training camps get underway Trysta Krick digests, debriefs and explains all the crazy moves made with a map. Take notes and get ready. USA TODAY\n\nSometimes a fine can be money well spent. Especially when a team is trying to retain an MVP.\n\nJust ask the Milwaukee Bucks, whom the NBA fined $50,000 last month after general manager Jon Horst said the Bucks planned to offer Giannis Antetokounmpo a supermax contract a year from now.\n\nThe Bucks delivered messages.\n\nOne to Antetokounmpo, letting him know they\u2019re willing to pay him a quarter of a billion dollars to continue his career in Milwaukee. And one to other teams, letting them know they\u2019re fixated on keeping Antetokounmpo and extending this run with the goal of winning at least one championship.\n\nAntetokounmpo can become a free agent after the 2020-21 season or he can sign a five-year, $253 million supermax extension next summer. If he waited to sign with another team, the max deal would be for four years, $161.3 million.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo warms up before a 2019 preseason game.

Can Boston improve?\n\nSTAFF PICKS: Who will win NBA title, MVP, ROY?\n\nAt Milwaukee\u2019s media day, Antetokounmpo said it wasn\u2019t fair to the team to ask him questions about the supermax extension or his future.\n\n\u201cI feel like if you have a great team and our goal is to win a championship and be the last team standing and get better every day, I think it\u2019s disrespectful toward my teammates talking about my free agency and what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d he said. \"When the time is right we\u2019re all going to talk about it. I don\u2019t think the time is right right now.\u201d\n\nWhile questions directed at him about that may be kept to a minimum, the topic isn\u2019t going away. Antetokounmpo\u2019s potential free agency is one of the NBA\u2019s most compelling story lines. Will he remain with the Bucks or seek titles elsewhere?\n\nSo far, the Bucks have done everything right, starting with taking a chance on the skinny teen with the No. 15 pick in the 2013 draft. Multiple players in that draft class picked ahead of Antetokounmpo, including overall No. 1 pick Anthony Bennett, aren\u2019t in the NBA anymore.\n\nMilwaukee has surrounded him with talented players, coaches and executives, too. Coach Mike Budenholzer was named Coach of the Year and Horst was named Executive of the Year.\n\nWhile the natural talent is there, the Bucks have also helped develop Antetokounmpo into an MVP and elite defender. At just 24 years old \u2013 not even the prime of his career \u2013 he is in position to win at least one more MVP and could win Defensive Player of the Year, too.\n\nHorst has continued to tinker with the roster to keep the core intact (though they lost Malcolm Brogdon in free agency), adding Wesley Matthews, Kyle Korver and Robin Lopez. Plus, Donte DiVincenzo returns healthy.\n\nKhris Middleton is an All-Star, and Eric Bledsoe and George Hill share point guard duties. Ersan Ilyasova and Brook Lopez are back, too.\n\n\"We brought back a big part of the group; we believe in continuity,\" Horst told reporters. \"... This group looks like they\u2019re growing, looks like they\u2019re getting better, looks like they fit and they make sense and that we can compete and sustain success for a long period of time with this group and that\u2019s been the goal.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s any pressure on the front office and ownership, it\u2019s to at least maintain the status quo \u2013 competing for a championship, which means reaching the conference finals and beyond.\n\nThe Bucks also have another major advantage \u2013 they have created a family and a trustworthy environment in the only American city Antetokounmpo, who grew up in Grece, really knows. There is value in that, though it doesn\u2019t mean Antetokounmpo should have blind loyalty.\n\nBut when you add up what the Bucks have done for Antetokounmpo, including building a championship contender, there are a lot of reasons why signing an extension makes sense for him.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt", "description": "Though Giannis Antetokounmpo doesn't want to talk about his supermax extension right now, the Bucks have done everything right so far.", "authors": ["Jeff Zillgitt", "Published A.M.
