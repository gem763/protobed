Greg Abbott speaks during a Sept. 1 news conference concerning the mass shooting in Odessa, Texas.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott expressed dismay on Monday that the mass shooter who killed seven people in West Texas had managed to buy an AR-style weapon in Texas even though he had a criminal history and didn\u2019t register for a background check.\n\nAbbott recently signed a host of new laws loosening gun restrictions in Texas, following guidelines provided by the National Rifle Association. And the Republican governor once tweeted that he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d that Texas trailed California in the number of gun purchases.\n\nBut in a Monday tweet, Abbott appeared rattled that the mass shooter had been able to purchase the AR-style gun that he used in Saturday\u2019s bloody rampage in Odessa and Midland.\n\nNot only did the Odessa gunman have a criminal history...\n\n\n\n...he also previously failed a gun purchase background check in Texas...\n\n\n\n...& he didn\u2019t go thru a background check for the gun he used in Odessa.\n\n\n\nWe must keep guns out of criminals\u2019 hands. https://t.co/vgrqcHtBtF \u2014 Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) September 2, 2019\n\nTexas Department of Public Safety records show that Seth Ator, 36, pleaded guilty in 2001 to misdemeanor counts of criminal trespass and evading arrest, the Austin American-Statesman reported. However, only felonies and misdemeanor domestic violence convictions block a gun purchase in Texas, according to the Texas Tribune.\n\nAtor had failed to pass an earlier background check to buy a gun and \u201cdidn\u2019t go thru a background check\u201d for the rifle he used on Saturday, according to Abbott\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe governor did not reveal how that gun was obtained. But Texas does not require background checks in most private sales, which includes some purchases at gun shows, according to the Tribune.\n\nAbbott championed the series of laxer Texas gun laws that went into effect the day after the Odessa attack. They allow people to pack weapons in public places such as schools and churches, as well as in foster homes.\n\nHouse Bill 1143, for instance, bars school districts from blocking licensed gun owners from keeping their firearms in vehicles in school parking lots, as long as the vehicles are locked and the weapons are out of sight.\n\nIn June, Abbott also vetoed a bill that would have made it a state crime to bring guns into secure areas of airports.\n\nI'm EMBARRASSED: Texas #2 in nation for new gun purchases, behind CALIFORNIA. Let's pick up the pace Texans. @NRA https://t.co/Ry2GInbS1g \u2014 Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) October 28, 2015\n\nAbbott is a particular favorite of the NRA, which hailed the new pro-gun measures. \u201cGovernor Greg Abbott has now signed all of the NRA-supported legislation which the Texas Legislature sent him during the 2019 session,\u201d the NRA website boasted.\n\nThe last time Abbott addressed a mass shooting in Texas was in early August when another gunman killed 22 people in an El Paso Walmart. The governor acknowledged at a press conference then that \u201cwe did not, as far as I know, evaluate for and plan for an incident like this\u201d in any of the new gun laws. But he emphasized that funding had been provided \u201cfor the state to better address\u201d mental health issues. There has been no indication that either gunman last month suffered from mental illness.\n\nAfter the El Paso attack, Abbott snapped at reporters who quizzed him on gun control, saying: \u201cWe need to focus more on memorials before we start the politics.\u201d\n\nTexas Gov.

But he has since backed down, reportedly after a call from the NRA. He insisted Sunday that stronger background checks wouldn\u2019t have made any difference in Odessa \u2014 though that was before Abbott\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cOver the last five, six, or seven years, no matter how strong you need the background checks, it wouldn\u2019t have stopped any of it,\u201d Trump told reporters.", "description": "Presumably, Gov.
