The new image would feature some subtle changes, with the \u2018O\u2019 in Sport redrawn to replicate the distinctive \u2018O\u2019 in Ineos and a new orange trim pulled from Ineos\u2019s branding.\n\nNaturally Lausanne\u2019s supporters weren\u2019t enamoured with the idea, and their protests eventually forced the redesign to be scrapped. Yet the fact that the plan ever came to fruition seemed at odds with Ratcliffe and his executive put in charge, David Thomas, both of whom professed to be lifelong football fans. They may like or even love sport, but sprucing up the crest of a century-old football club with corporate imagery did not suggest much understanding of the game.\n\nIneos ran into a number of difficulties at Lausanne, who were soon relegated, and it would have been enough to put most people off. Instead Ratcliffe got a taste for it, and if anything his forays into the world of sport have become even more audacious. His company has pledged \u00a3110m to Ben Ainslie\u2019s attempt to bring the America\u2019s Cup back Britain for the first time since 1855, bought cycling\u2019s Team Sky, now Team Ineos, winning the Tour de France in July, and this summer bought the football club down the coast from his Monaco home, Nice.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe grandest of all Ineos\u2019s ambitious plans came this weekend, funding the enormous 1.59 challenge which saw Eliud Kipchoge become the first person ever to complete a marathon in less than two hours. As the world watched, the Kenyan crossed the line in 1.59.41 with Ineos\u2019s name on the his chest, followed by a pack of Ineos-branded pacesetters.\n\nPerhaps we should be grateful that Britain\u2019s richest man is spending his fortune in the world of sport. That is certainly one image of Ratcliffe, the benevolent billionaire, founder of the Go Run for Fun charity and all-round sports enthusiast doing what many of us might if we had his bank balance. As Ratcliffe put it: \u201cWe make six or seven billion dollars a year in profit, so what\u2019s wrong with investing a bit of that in sport?\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

marathon attempt Kipchoge celebrates breaking the two-hour barrier in the marathon EPA\n\nYet there are some common threads in his ventures which aren\u2019t so reassuring. Confrontation and controversy seem to come as part of the deal. One of Ratcliffe\u2019s more petty fallouts was with the British Olympic Association (BOA) over the name of his America\u2019s Cup team, which he wanted to call Team GB, which is owned by the BOA. He said he would be promoting Team GB\u2019s name in a \u201cpatriotic light\u201d, but after being refused he wrote to the BOA inviting them to \u201ctake a long walk off a short plank\u201d, declaring he had changed the name to \u201cTeam UK, which I much prefer\u201d.\n\nRatcliffe\u2019s move to buy Team Sky drew accusations of greenwashing as he plastered his petrochemicals company\u2019s brand over a cycling team \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t really understand what greenwashing is,\u201d he said \u2013 and he brazenly launched the new Team Ineos at the Tour de Yorkshire, where the fracking industry he strongly supports is such a divisive topic for local communities. It drew protesters to the start line but then that seems par for the course: Ratcliffe has fallen out with just about everyone from environmentalists to the government, and even his neighbours.\n\nPerhaps we get another sense of his character from his sporting feats. Ratcliffe has ridden long-distance bike races in his 60s, completed expeditions to both the North and South Poles and pushed himself so hard at the New York marathon needed a drip at the finish. This is someone driven to the point of obsessive when it comes to achieving his goals, and it explains why he would not accept failure at the 1.59 challenge. This wasn\u2019t an attempt, it was a statement of fact: a marathon can be run in less than two hours and Ratcliffe was going to prove it, even if his legs weren\u2019t covering the ground. He found the fastest runner on the planet, the springiest shoes on the market (or off it), on the flattest ground on the mildest morning with a raft of world-class pace-setters and a green laser beam lighting the path, and he succeeded.\n\nThis, it seems, has been the overriding point so far. Grand gestures, big shows of sporting exhibitionism and history written, from cycling\u2019s pinnacle to one of athletics\u2019 great barriers, all played out under the Ineos flag.\n\nWhat comes next? Ratcliffe has looked into buying Chelsea Football Club, near his Knightsbridge headquarters, although that appears unlikely any time soon. In the meantime Ineos will fly its flag up the mountains of the Tour de France and over the oceans of the America\u2019s Cup, and you suspect this is just the start. Success in sport can be addictive, and now Ratcliffe has got the taste, we are likely to be seeing an awful lot more of Ineos in the years to come.", "description": "One of the first moves made by Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s petrochemicals company\u00a0Ineos when it bought the historic Swiss football club FC Lausanne-Sport was to order a rebrand of the club\u2019s crest.
