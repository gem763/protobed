Don\u2019t Betray Them.", "language": "en", "text": "David Petraeus, a retired general and former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and more than 25 American generals and admirals recently wrote to President Trump supporting a robust refugee resettlement program \u2014 especially for people who have served American military and intelligence agencies in their native countries. But the Trump administration has decided to slash the overall number of refugees to be accepted in the coming year to 18,000 from 30,000, which increases pressure on already limited special programs for foreign friends who risk their lives to help America.\n\nThe letter warned that broad cuts could jeopardize the lives of the many foreigners employed abroad by our Defense Department, with a presence in more than 70 countries; by our Peace Corps in over 60; by the United States Agency for International Development in over 100; and by every embassy, where locals are hired as staff. The new quotas ignore that, carving out one meager special program for local people who served the American military in Iraq.\n\nThe United States depends on locals everywhere, for their native language skills, cultural knowledge and relationships to do things and obtain information Americans cannot. When these so-called foreign nationals work in war zones, they risk ostracism, imprisonment or death. If the American military presence is large, it can offer them and their families some protection. But when the troops leave, protection can give way to retribution by adversaries.\n\nThe latest cut for all refugees comes as the Trump administration and Congress, weary of \u201cendless war,\u201d commit inadequate resources to support the foreigners who have worked with us.", "description": "If President Trump\u2019s hopes of withdrawing from war zones are realized, his government has a duty to protect the many foreigners who have helped U.S. forces there.", "authors": ["Philip Caruso"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/03/opinion/03caruso/03caruso-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
