This is her point of view, it's almost always her point of view.\"\n\nThe final season of the show saw Carrie move to Paris to embark on a relationship with artist Aleksandr Petrovsky, leaving her laptop back in New York.\n\n(Image: CHANNEL 5)\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nSarah, who is married to actor Matthew Broderick, pointed out that this was the first time in the show that her character wasn't telling the story, proving that the laptop was \"the conduit\" for her friends to exist.\n\nShe said: \"Think about it for a second, right?\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Sarah has said something that could change fans' view of the show.\n\nIn 2016, she said on CBS Sunday Morning that she thought Carrie was \"immature\".\n\nShe said Carrie felt \"it had to be love, love, love, love all the time\" and that she thought that was \"childish\".\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nAnd in 2015, she told E! News that she's very different to her character in real life.\n\nShe said: \"I think there's not a lot about Carrie that is actually similar to my life. Our choices have been so radically different.\n\n\"There are certain kinds of pillars that fundamentally are different. I like clothing, but I don't have anywhere near a fevered relationship that she does.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
