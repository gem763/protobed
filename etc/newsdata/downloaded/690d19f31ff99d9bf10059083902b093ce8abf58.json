And they blamed then-President Obama, saying he lacked oversight at the time and has failed to speak about it since.\n\n\u201cI think there is a very big reason that Obama is being quiet, because all of this abuse of power, all of this corruption, all happened on his watch,\u201d Hannity said in the exchange, shared by Media Matters above.\n\nTo which Eric Trump replied: \u201cThere is no question it leads right to him. And by the way, it\u2019s not exactly like, you know, he\u2019s a quiet guy. And he has run away from this. He has run away from his vice president. Could you imagine if the roles were reversed, right, and this was Mike Pence, right? I mean they would be killing my father right now.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s father has been pushing the discredited claim of Biden wrongdoing in Ukraine in response to a House impeachment inquiry. The probe was launched after a whistleblower red-flagged President Donald Trump\u2019s July phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, pressuring the foreign leader to investigate Biden and his son Hunter while military aid to Ukraine was being withheld.\n\nEric Trump and Hannity were all too eager to help the beleaguered president by bringing up his predecessor.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the only guy who\u2019s hiding,\u201d Eric Trump said of Obama, railing about the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of the situation (per Fox News). \u201cI mean, Joe Biden was his vice president. Where is Obama? What does he think about this rampant corruption?\u201d\n\nWatch the clip above.", "description": "The Fox News host and Donald Trump's son continued pushing unfounded accusations against Joe Biden amid the Ukraine whistleblower scandal.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9f0997200000da064ff33a.png?cache=1anhnfsnbf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
