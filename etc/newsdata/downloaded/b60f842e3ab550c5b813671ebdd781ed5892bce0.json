And articles were written in which I was harshly criticised.\n\n(Image: FIFA via Getty)\n\nOn the Palace game, in which his errors helped lead to goals for Christian Benteke and Wilfried Zaha, he added: \"I'm self-critical enough to realise that I made those mistakes.\n\n\"I can also deal with tough criticism. But the criticism has become escalated and irrational. I have become a target.\n\n\"At some point, people even blamed me for a defeat I had not played at all.\"", "description": "The German defender has been on the receiving end of much criticism from Gunners supporters", "authors": ["Mark Jones", "Image", "Getty Images", "Fifa Via Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20539342.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-FC-v-Standard-Liege-Group-F-UEFA-Europa-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
