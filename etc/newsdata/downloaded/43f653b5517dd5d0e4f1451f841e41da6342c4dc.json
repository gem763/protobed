Appearing at a midday news conference with Johnson, Trump spent much of his time praising the embattled British prime minister.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a professional,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s just another day at the office.\u201d\n\nBut Trump was dogged by difficult questions pertaining to a phone call with the Ukrainian president in which he allegedly brought up investigating former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nAsked at the news conference why aid was withheld from Ukraine, Trump gave a lengthy answer that pointed the blame at other nations.\n\n\u201cThere was never any quid pro quo,\u201d he said, shortly before ending the news conference.\n\nThe phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been the focus of speculation after it was revealed that a member of the U.S. intelligence community had filed an official complaint about Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\nAs the day went on, the pressure built. At 2:10 p.m., Trump said he would release a transcript of the phone call.\n\n\u201cI am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nWhatever the contents of the transcript, its release is unlikely to placate critics, who have argued that the full whistleblower complaint needs to be released, too.\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chair of the House Intelligence Committee, announced at 2.30 p.m. that the whistleblower was seeking to speak directly to the committee and that he hoped to hear the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s testimony as soon as this week.\u201d\n\nMultiple news outlets reported that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said she planned to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump about 5 p.m. Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we have the facts, we\u2019re ready. Now that we have the facts, we\u2019re ready,\u201d Pelosi said at a forum hosted by the Atlantic on Tuesday. \u201cFor later today.\u201d\n\nPelosi had resisted calls to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump. According to a Washington Post analysis, a section of Democrats who opposed impeachment have come out in favor of an inquiry over the past 48 hours, with more than 150 of 235 House Democrats in favor.\n\nFor both Trump and Johnson, the political scandals overshadowed attempts to set the agenda at the most important gathering of world leaders of the year. The United States and Britain have been trying to find their own common ground on major foreign issues, including the standoffs with China and Iran.\n\nAnd for both the British and U.S. leaders, the day isn\u2019t over. That\u2019s especially true for Johnson, who is expected to get on a flight Tuesday evening to return for the reopening of Parliament on Wednesday.", "description": "The special relationship had a tough day in New York City.", "authors": ["Adam Taylor", "Foreign Reporter Who Writes About A Variety Of Subjects"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/V5SrZTKo-xrD3HRSO9PF6bHgN14=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FHSK7YG65QI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
