(AP Photo/Karim Kadim, File)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 For Georges Salines, whose 28-year-old daughter Lola was killed when Islamic extremists went on a bloody rampage in Paris in 2015, the death of the man who inspired the attack brought a welcome \"sense of satisfaction.\"\n\nBut like other survivors and families of victims of the Islamic State group, Salines stressed that the death of its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, does not mean the fight against terrorism is over.\n\n\"It would have been even better if al-Baghdadi could have been captured and sent to trial,\" Salines told The Associated Press. \"That was probably impossible. We knew that for a long time.\"\n\nAl-Baghdadi was responsible for directing and inspiring attacks by his followers around the world. In Iraq and Syria, he steered his organization into committing acts of brutality on a mass scale: massacres of his opponents; beheadings and stonings that were broadcast to a shocked audience on the internet; and the kidnapping and enslavement of women.\n\nHis death was announced Sunday by U.S. President Donald Trump, who said al-Baghdadi detonated an explosive vest while being pursued by U.S. forces in Syria, killing himself and three of his children. It was another major blow to the Islamic State group, which in March was forced by U.S. and Kurdish forces out of the last part of its self-declared \"caliphate\" that once spanned a swath of Iraq and Syria at its height.\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks on Paris cafes, the national stadium and the Bataclan concert hall that left 130 people dead, including Lola Salines and Thomas Duperron, 30.\n\nDuperron's father, Philippe, who is president of French victims' association 13onze15, which takes its name from the date of the attacks, said al-Baghdadi's death was \"not bad news.\"\n\n\"One major player of the Islamic state group's actions has disappeared,\" he told AP, although he said that his group would not express joy at any death.\n\nA trial of suspects in the Paris attacks is expected to begin in 2021. French prosecutors said this month that the judicial investigation of the attacks has ended and that 1,740 plaintiffs have joined the proceedings. Fourteen people have been charged in the case, including Salah Abdeslam, the only surviving suspect of the group of assailants.\n\nFrench magistrates had recently issued an international arrest warrant for al-Baghdadi in a counterterrorism investigation for \"heading or organizing a criminal terrorist conspiracy.\"\n\nArthur Denouveaux, a Bataclan survivor and president of the Life for Paris victims' group, told the French newspaper Le Parisien \"us, the victims, are not seeking revenge ... but a desire for justice.\"\n\nAl-Baghdadi's death is \"symbolically is a major blow to the operational capacities\" of the IS group, he said.\n\n\"It is essential to continue the fight for the security of the region and also of European countries,\" Denouveaux added.\n\nThe IS group claimed responsibility for three suicide bombings in Brussels on March 22, 2016, that killed 32 people at its airport and in a metro station. Philippe Vansteenkiste, who lost his sister in the airport bombing and went on to become director of V-Europe, an association of victims of those attacks, said he knows the fight is not over.\n\n\"This is a new step in the fight against Daesh, but I'm not naive,\" Vansteenkiste said, using an Arabic acronym for the militant group. \"Their spiritual leader has been hit, but Daesh and many sleeping cells still exist, either in Syria or in our country.\"\n\nThe parents of Steven Sotloff, an American-Israeli journalist who was killed by IS, thanked Trump and the U.S. forces that conducted the raid that led to al-Baghdadi's death.\n\n\"While the victory will not bring our beloved son Steven back to us, it is a significant step in the campaign against ISIS,\" Shirley Sotloff told reporters at their Florida home.\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, the militants held more than 20 Western hostages in Syria and tortured many of them. The group beheaded seven U.S., British and Japanese journalists and aid workers and a group of Syrian soldiers. Sotloff was among them.\n\nIn Jordan, Safi al-Kasasbeh, whose son was slain by the IS group in 2014, said he was \"very happy\" to learn of al-Baghdadi's death.\n\n\"I wished that I killed him with my bare hands,\" al-Kasasbeh said. \"This was one of my dreams, if not to be the one who kills him, at least to witness the moment when he gets killed. But Allah didn't want that to happen.\"", "description": "\"It would have been even better if al-Baghdadi could have been captured and sent to trial,\" Salines told The Associated Press.
