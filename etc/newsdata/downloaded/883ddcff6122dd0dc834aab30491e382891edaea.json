Normally when firms go bust, the fear is diminished competition. Not here. These loans were unneeded, unwanted, unhelpful, destructive and addictive.\n\n\"It's important to understand the payday loan industry was built on the back of marketing, not need. They sold people the concept of a need to create a demand, then pushed their products. These debts for the vast majority of customers were hideously over-expensive and unhelpful.\n\n\"The only problem with QuickQuid\u2019s demise is the potential that this big parent company wangles out of its obligation to pay the compensation to people whose lives were made miserable. I hope that won\u2019t happen, I suspect it will happen. Morality has never been at the forefront of these companies\u2019 minds.\"\n\nI have a loan with QuickQuid - what does this mean?\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"Many QuickQuid customers will be feeling uncertain about what this means for them. While you may be tempted to stop your repayments, it is crucial to keep to your regular schedule, because if you have entered into a loan agreement you must fulfil it,\" Caroline Siarkiewicz, chief executive at the Money and Pensions Service, said.\n\n\"If you miss any repayments you could be hit by fees and additional charges, and it could also harm your credit rating , which could impact your future access to credit, loans, a mortgage and even your phone bill.\n\n\"11 and a half million adults have less than \u00a3100 in savings and investments so lots of people face cash-flow problems which can make quick, short-term credit feel like the only option. If you know you need a specific amount of money for a short while there may be more affordable alternatives out there so it\u2019s a good idea to shop around before you borrow.\n\nThe Money Advice Service website has a guide on alternatives to payday loans. You can also contact its free helpline on 0800 138 7777.\n\nHave I been mis-sold a QuickQuid loan?\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"QuickQuid\u2019s neglect of consumer rights is deplorable,\" explains Aman Johal, at consumer action law firm Your Lawyers .\n\n\"The business, which claimed to provide short-term financial support, is leaving inconceivable numbers of victims out of pocket following its announcement to leave the UK market.\n\n\"An estimated 10,000 complaints from people mis-sold money are outstanding. Based upon recent results from the Financial Ombudsman Service, potentially 6,000 of those would likely have had their complaints upheld and will be left uncompensated with their consumer rights flouted by the loan provider.\n\n\"This unbelievable shirking of responsibility cannot go unchallenged \u2013 QuickQuid must ensure complaints are resolved, and consumer rights are restored.\n\n\"The regulatory measures which have warded off predatory loan firms have created a better environment for consumers \u2013 but before QuickQuid exits the UK, it must do what\u2019s right.\"\n\nIf you think you've been mis-sold a loan, start by putting your complaint in writing to QuickQuid.\n\nIf you're unhappy with its resolution - or you receive nothing in eight weeks - you can then escalate it to the Financial Ombudsman .\n\nAdjudicators will then look at whether the company did everything it was required to do (ie through affordability checks), whether it acted unfairly or unreasonably in any way and whether the customer lost out as a result of any of its failures (ie where it failed to act in your best interests).", "description": "While the company has not quite collapsed, CashEuroNetUK has announced plans to withdraw from Britain - just months after the FCA introduced new affordability guidelines on who and what it can lend to customers", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Getty", "Pa", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article1754522.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Payday-loans.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
