As we head towards summer, this fact is becoming increasingly relevant. Parents can get distracted (it\u2019s a party, after all) or misjudge their children\u2019s swimming capabilities or feel a false sense of security because, look, there are so many adults here.\n\nThe fact is that drowning remains the leading cause of unintentional death among children ages 1 to 4, and the second most common cause of death among children ages 5 to 14, according to U.S. health authority, the CDC.\n\nSome parents set up a \u201cwater watcher\u201d system where adults who are strong swimmers take turns completely focusing their attention on the kids in the pool.\n\nThis is smart, but as we learned, drowning can be surprisingly difficult to spot. If you\u2019re going to have a children\u2019s pool party, I would also do this: Make it a life jacket party.\n\nThe idea comes from drowning investigator Natalie Livingston, who recently wrote a viral Facebook post on water safety (you should read the whole thing \u2014 it\u2019s fantastic).\n\nShe admits that making everyone wear a life jacket might sound supremely uncool, but that\u2019s just because our culture has a negative attitude toward life jackets. (I, too, cannot help but think of the Feegans on South Park.) Let\u2019s end the stigma. \u201cWe just need to make them cool again,\u201d Livingston writes. \u201c ... Having everyone in one makes it much \u2018cooler\u2019 and doesn\u2019t embarrass the littler kids or weaker swimmers.\u201d\n\nLivingston gives ideas for activities that kids can do in life jackets: \u201crolling log\u201d challenges, water balloon tossing contests, and relays where you pass rings from your toes. Sure, your children might want to lose the jackets and show off what they\u2019ve been learning in swim class, but they can do that when they\u2019re with you by themselves. At a pool party, when so much is going on, there needs to be rules.\n\nJust make sure the life jackets are approved as safe, Livingston warns. \u201cNoodles, inflatables, baby circles, tubes, and all other items are not safety related and should not be used or trusted to keep your child safe,\u201d she writes. If you\u2019re hosting the party, you might purchase a basic $15 life jacket for each guest.\n\nAs Livingston explains, even if the kids are wearing life jackets, you still need to diligently supervise them as they can get into positions that obstruct their airways. But having the life jackets on gives them an added layer of protection, and lets them still have some summer fun.", "description": "I hate to be a scrooge, but it\u2019s time to declare that pool parties with lots of kids are typically just not safe.
