If you and I are the same age, weight and gender, and our body fat percentage is the same, our base metabolism \u2014 the stuff that keeps our organs working and our temperature constant \u2014 \u201cmight vary on average 200 calories,\u201d says Eric Ravussin, director of the Nutrition Obesity Research Center at Louisiana State University. \u201cThe extreme can be plus or minus 200 calories; you can be 400 calories apart.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFour hundred calories isn\u2019t chump change. It means you can have a grande Mocha Frappuccino every single day and I can\u2019t. Or vice versa. So I asked whether that difference can account for the obesity epidemic.\n\nRavussin, who seems like a perfectly nice person, didn\u2019t say, \u201cWhat a stupid question,\u201d but he sounded a little incredulous. \u201cI don\u2019t think it explains our obesity epidemic. The genes, the biology hasn\u2019t changed over the past 50 years. Weight gain is the result of interactions of your biology and the environment. What has changed drastically is the environment.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAlthough some part of those 400 calories you and I might vary by is genetic, that\u2019s not what\u2019s mostly at play here. Ruth Loos, a professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, wrote in an email that the contribution of resting metabolic rate to obesity \u201cis small and the genetic component is very likely to be small as well.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOkay then, what is it? \u201cThe brain-regulating hedonic aspects of food intake are very likely to be much bigger,\u201d wrote Loos.\n\nThat \u201chedonic\u201d part needs a little explanation. There are basically two reasons we eat. The first is to live; we respond to internal hunger and satiety cues to regulate our intake. That\u2019s called homeostatic eating. But anyone who\u2019s ever found room for dessert after a big meal knows that there\u2019s being full, and then there\u2019s blueberry pie.\n\nAD\n\nWe don\u2019t just eat for sustenance. We also eat for pleasure \u2014 hedonic eating \u2014 and although the two kinds aren\u2019t completely separate, they are governed in different ways. Hedonic eating involves the reward circuitry in your brain, and deliciousness takes satiety to the cleaners. The 40 to 70 percent of obesity that is thought to be heritable (Loos finds 50 percent to be a reasonable estimate) is operating primarily in deliciousness territory, not in metabolism territory. \u201cWe find the genes are implicated in eating behavior,\u201d says Loos.\n\nAD\n\nNo expert I\u2019ve ever spoken with about this believes we have anything close to all the answers. Giles Yeo, a researcher at the University of Cambridge and the author of \u201cGene Eating: The Science of Obesity and the Truth About Diets,\u201d says more than 300 genes appear to play a role in obesity \u2014 so far \u2014 and researchers are just beginning to figure out what they do.\n\nFrom what we do know, says Yeo, \u201cit\u2019s the brain.\u201d Partly, that\u2019s how we experience hunger. It\u2019s also how we experience the reward element of food. \u201cGenetic propensity to obesity is a propensity to eat more.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the face of our modern food environment (read: tempting, convenient, cheap, calorie-dense food coming at you 24/7), some of us are genetically predisposed to weight gain. We hear the call of food louder. And some of us are also better at resisting it. Both Loos and Yeo told me that willpower probably also has a genetic component (something we can say of \u201cthe vast majority of human traits, plausibly all,\u201d says Yeo), and that, too, comes into play.\n\nAD\n\nBut let\u2019s step away from the genome. The conversation about the 50 percent, give or take, of obesity that\u2019s genetic isn\u2019t complete without the 50 percent that isn\u2019t. It\u2019s \u201clifestyle, different diets, different neighborhoods, different medications,\u201d says Loos.\n\nAll of those things are related to socioeconomic status, and it turns out that matters a lot. Clare Llewellyn, an associate professor at University College London, studies the genetic component of obesity by studying twins, and she has found that the higher you go up the socioeconomic scale, the less your genes matter.\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s happening in homes, with individuals, is a microcosm of what\u2019s happening societally. \u201cIf you\u2019re reared in an environment where you have access to highly palatable food, the child will respond to those food cues by eating. If you\u2019re the same [genetically], but reared in an environment with lots of fruits and vegetables on show, model behavior by parents, you\u2019re not going to have the opportunity for those genes to be expressed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGood to know that growing up in a nice neighborhood with an affluent and well-educated family mitigates a genetic propensity to obesity, but is that really useful information to those of us who fight our weight?\n\nIn a way, it is. In fact, I think it\u2019s key. It tells us the environment is the difference between whether somebody dealt a lousy genetic hand gains weight or doesn\u2019t. Before about 1950, few of us faced an obesogenic environment. Now, we all do, and the further down the socioeconomic scale you happen to be, the worse it is.\n\nAD\n\nSo the food environment has to change. Which pretty much everyone agrees on. But while we continue to argue about a sugar tax and zoning restrictions on fast-food outlets and school lunch standards, is there anything we, the people, can do in the meantime?\n\nI\u2019m sorry to report that neither Llewellyn nor Yeo is terribly optimistic about how successfully individuals can navigate this environment without changes coming from government and corporate sectors, but the direction of the effort we all need to make is clear: Control whatever parts of the environment you can (a strategy I\u2019ve written about before).\n\nAD\n\nOver some 20 years talking to scientists about genes and obesity, there\u2019s one thing I never heard: Try the [fill in the blank] diet. These researchers are definitely not singing out of the diet industry\u2019s hymn book. Nobody mentions leptin or insulin or carbohydrate metabolism. Diets are about biology; geneticists talk behavior.\n\nAD\n\nWhich leaves me very, very skeptical about the future of personalized diets for weight loss. If the genetic component is more about how you respond to food \u2014 how delicious it is to you, how sensitive you are to hunger signals, how effectively you manage temptation \u2014 the genes that control, say, your insulin response may not be terribly relevant. Since all these things are interconnected, never say never, but my crystal ball says personalized diets won\u2019t be any better than garden-variety, unpersonalized diets.\n\nOf course, the personal attention and belief that \u201cthis time, it\u2019s personal\u201d may help strengthen people\u2019s resolve, in which case the diet may indeed be more effective. I eagerly await the controlled trial where half the participants are told the assigned diet is genome-based while the other half are told it\u2019s just another diet.\n\nAD\n\nAs much as I would like to report that understanding obesity\u2019s genetic roots can help us all lose weight, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t. But what it does tell us is that, by focusing so inexorably on biology, we\u2019re missing the boat. \u201cGenes load the gun, and the environment pulls the trigger,\u201d Loos told me. Low-fat and low-carb and South Beach and paleo and Whole30 and keto and vegan are the deck chairs we\u2019ve been rearranging for decades now. Iceberg, dead ahead.\n\nMore from Food:\n\nAD", "description": "UNEARTHED | Do these genes make you (look) fat?", "authors": ["Tamar Haspel", "Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/e5WaM5NJzvCM-dNy_R7DoYpi28I=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UZAKNCHR2UI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
