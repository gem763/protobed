Pearly whites are the new status symbol", "language": "en", "text": "My teeth have been crumbling, like badly fired bricks, for years \u2014 even though I brush rigorously and eat a healthy, low(ish) sugar diet.\n\nI blame it on my childhood dentist, (my siblings and I nicknamed him \u2018Mr Misery\u2019), who inserted huge amalgam fillings into every available molar.\n\nMy teeth suffered further during my first pregnancy at 33. Morning sickness meant sugary carbs were the only foods I could stomach. Pregnancy can lead to dental problems as increased hormones, particularly progesterone, dial up your body\u2019s response to plaque (the germs on your teeth) making it easier for bacteria to grow. In my case it meant eight fillings and a lost tooth.\n\nI saw countless dentists but the sky-high costs were off putting. And I\u2019m not alone. Government figures show the number of us who regularly visit the dentist has dropped to just under 50 per cent of the adult population, thanks in part to an NHS with long waiting times and exorbitant private dental health costs.\n\nAnabel Curtler (pictured) paid \u00a33,640 plus \u00a3660 for travel and four-star accommodation to have dental treatment in Budapest\n\nSo I muddled along \u2014 until last year when another two molars disintegrated. The NHS wouldn\u2019t fund my treatment. Implants are only available to those who can\u2019t wear dentures or whose teeth have been damaged by cancer or an accident, for example. And an initial quote from a Harley Street dentist was a tooth-grinding \u00a38,000.\n\nThat\u2019s when I became a dental tourist \u2014 one of the growing number of Britons travelling to cheaper countries in Europe for work on their teeth.\n\nA friend who\u2019d had treatment in Hungary was ecstatic with the service. I learned that the country\u2019s capital Budapest has a history of dental work.\n\nThe number of UK medical tourists visiting Budapest tripled in 2017, with implants and crowns topping treatment lists.\n\nBut in my case it was a health issue, too. Still, travelling abroad for any treatment was scary. I was conscious that if things went wrong, legally, you can be on shaky ground.\n\nProfessor Ruth Holliday of Leeds University has warned many health tourists \u2018choose doctors in the same way that you choose a tradesman like a plasterer \u2014 on the recommendation of their friends\u2019 rather than their medical credentials.\n\nProfessor Ruth Holliday of Leeds University, found that 16.5 per cent of health tourists have experienced complications\n\nMost, her research found, were happy with their treatment, but 16.5 per cent experienced complications while 8.7 per cent needed further treatment.\n\nMany clinics have Facebook communities of fans discussing their procedures, but it\u2019s vital to check any clinic or doctor before considering treatment.\n\nLook for customers\u2019 recommendations, financial guarantees if anything goes wrong and a solid insurance policy.\n\nAt least I started out in Central London at the Implant Centre \u2014 choosing a business with a UK presence means you can reach them if you need follow up treatment. Implant expert Dr Atilla Kaman \u2014 who wears loafers and bears a resemblance to crooner Julio Iglesias \u2014 flies between European clinics to assess patients before treatment in Hungary. I was told I needed two implants and three crowns, plus a bone graft and another tooth pulled.\n\nThat meant ten months\u2019 work and two visits to Budapest \u2014 a total of 4,000 airmiles \u2014 the first to do the bone graft, the second to fit the crowns.\n\nAnabel met sales trainer Linda O\u2019Donell, 52, from Hertfordshire while travelling to her hotel. Linda spent more than \u00a33,500 on unsuccessful treatments at a UK practice (file image)\n\nI\u2019d also have check-ups in between. It sounded daunting \u2014 but the quote came in at just \u00a33,640 plus \u00a3660 for travel and four-star accommodation. I decided to take the plunge.\n\nAt the airport a driver was waiting to whisk me and two other dental tourists to our hotel. My companions were a Russian lady and a man from Lincolnshire who\u2019d been coming for ten years and had a mouth full of implants and crowns on his ruined teeth, which now gleamed. \u2018I was so ashamed of my teeth,\u2019 he confided. \u2018It was the best investment I ever made and now I come back whenever I need any dental work at all.\u2019\n\nAnother Briton who\u2019s opted for dental tourism in Hungary is sales trainer Linda O\u2019Donell, 52, from Bushy Heath, Hertfordshire. Linda spent more than \u00a33,500 on unsuccessful treatments at a UK practice that later closed.\n\nIn her 30s, she decided she\u2019d have to muddle on as long as she could. By the time she decided enough was enough, she had gum disease and was quoted \u00a345,000 for treatment in the UK. It meant extracting all her remaining teeth and inserting upper and lower implants with bone grafts and porcelain bridges.\n\nAnabel was greeted at the clinic in Budapest by an English-speaking member of staff, while Dr Kaman, one of Europe\u2019s most experienced maxillofacial surgeons was in charge (file image)\n\nShe paid \u00a318,000, plus \u00a31,000 for three round trips to Budapest \u2014 saving around \u00a326,000.\n\nA year on, she says the difference is life-changing. \u2018My teeth made me feel so self-conscious. I knew when I smiled people\u2019s perception changed. There are very few photos of me laughing, pre implants, but that\u2019s different now. I can\u2019t wait to smile.\u2019\n\nNow it was my turn. I was greeted at the clinic by an English-speaking staff in white tunics. In charge was Dr Kaman, one of Europe\u2019s most experienced maxillofacial surgeons.\n\nI was not at all looking forward to my bone graft, which involves a local anaesthetic and fiddly drilling and filling.\n\nThere was some alarming tugging and hammering when the tooth was pulled. I left with an ice pack, strong painkillers, antibiotics and a protocol to help healing. Five months later I was back to have my implants fitted \u2014 and suddenly, I was in possession of a perfect set of gnashers.\n\nForget Hollywood, the Hungarian smile is where it\u2019s at.", "description": "As Government figures show that less than 50 per cent of adults regularly visit the dentist, Anabel Curtler reveals how she was able to obtain the perfect smile by travelling to Budapest.", "authors": ["Anabel Cutler For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/22/20105594-0-image-a-109_1571867850445.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
