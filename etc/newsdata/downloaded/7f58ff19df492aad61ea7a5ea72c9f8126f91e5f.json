REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson\n\nMeng, 47, was arrested at the airport on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States, where she is charged with bank fraud and accused of misleading the bank HSBC about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd\u2019s business in Iran. She has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.\n\nIn the British Columbia Supreme Court, Meng\u2019s lawyers are seeking further documentation from Canada\u2019s Department of Justice (DOJ), the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). They claim they meet the legal standard that there\u2019s \u201can air of reality that there are other documents... that have not been disclosed,\u201d according to the document.\n\nIf they ultimately help prove the Canadian officials abused their authority, her lawyers say, the extradition proceedings should be halted.\n\nThe documents demanded pertain to the Nov. 30 coordination in the lead up to the arrest between the DOJ, the CBSA and the RCMP, and Meng\u2019s arrest on Dec. 1, 2018.\n\nLawyers for Canada\u2019s attorney general started their oral arguments on behalf of the United States in a Vancouver courtroom Monday.\n\nIn their filing last week, they said the Crown already provided extensive documents to Meng, and that contacts between U.S. and Canadian authorities under such circumstances are encouraged.\n\nThat filing also said there was no evidence of any misconduct by border or police officers, or that Meng\u2019s rights were violated, and there was no need for additional disclosure.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t established an air of reality to anything,\u201d Robert Frater, counsel for the attorney general, told the judge last week, speaking of the legal standard.\n\nMeng\u2019s lawyers wrapped up their arguments last week. Oral arguments by counsel for the Canadian attorney general are scheduled to run through Friday this week but could end earlier.\n\nThe extradition proceeding itself is scheduled to begin in January and experts say legal wrangling could go on for years.", "description": "Lawyers for Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou detailed a list of emails, notes and other records they are seeking to prove that her rights were violated before her December arrest at Vancouver's airport, according to a court document released on Monday.", "authors": ["Moira Warburton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435683903&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T1H2", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
