NO COMMERCIAL OR EDITORIAL SALES IN POLAND.\n\nA proposed clause in Britain\u2019s EU divorce deal designed to protect the peace deal by ensuring an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland has become the key sticking point in efforts to agree a managed exit before Britain\u2019s exit date of Oct. 31, raising fears of a chaotic withdrawal.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has demanded that the so-called \u201cbackstop\u201d clause be removed as it could subject Britain to EU rules after exit day, but the Irish government says that can only happen if an alternative mechanism to ensure an open border is agreed.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work closely with our partners in Ireland and the United Kingdom to support a Brexit plan that encourages stability and also one that keeps the strong foundation forged by the (1998) Good Friday Agreement,\u201d Pence told reporters after arriving in Ireland for a two-day visit.\n\n\u201cWe understand these are complex issues,\u201d said Pence after arriving at Shannon Airport from Poland where he commemorated the 80th anniversary of the beginning of World War Two.\n\nOn Thursday Pence is due to visit London and meet with Johnson, who U.S. President Donald Trump last week praised as \u201cexactly what the U.K. has been looking for\u201d.\n\nPence said he hoped talks with the Irish government on this issue would make Washington \u201ceven better equipped to hopefully play a constructive role in ensuring that when Brexit occurs it in turn will reflect stability and addresses the unique relationship between the UK and the Republic of Ireland\u201d.\n\nThe Good Friday agreement, which helped end three decades of violence in Northern Ireland, dismantled all physical border infrastructure between EU member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland, guaranteeing that people and goods on either side can move freely.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi last month said there was no chance Congress would approve a planned U.S.-British trade deal if Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union undermined the landmark 1998 Good Friday peace agreement.\n\nPence, a descendent of Irish immigrants, is visiting Ireland for the first time as vice president.", "description": "The United States wants the terms of Britain's exit from the European Union to protect stability on the island of Ireland and respect Northern Ireland's 1998 peace deal, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Monday.", "authors": ["Alexandra Alper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425454448&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF811DP"}
