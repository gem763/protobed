The prime minister believes he now has enough support for his deal, but it is possible the bill will be amended to add changes suggested by the opposition.\n\nStarmer said Johnson\u2019s deal had a \u201ctrapdoor to no deal\u201d contained within it, but he suggested Labour could back it if it meant achieving a second referendum and the option of remaining in the EU.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, he said: \u201cWe will see what that looks like but it makes sense to say that by whatever means we get that referendum. The spirit of this is clear. We offered this to Theresa May. We said: we don\u2019t think your deal is very good but if it\u2019s up against the safeguard of being able to remain then we will allow it to proceed in that way.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe position we have adopted is whatever the outcome, whether it\u2019s Boris Johnson\u2019s bad deal or a better one which could be secured, it has got to go to a referendum up against remain.\u201d\n\nStarmer said Labour would have to look at the specific circumstances before deciding how to vote and the party would try to amend Johnson\u2019s deal to prevent a no-deal departure and allow the UK to have a closer relationship with the EU in future.\n\n\u201cWe will put down amendments to make sure the future destination is a close economic relationship with the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been arguing for a very long time for a customs union with the EU and single market alignment.\u201d\n\nStarmer added: \u201cThere are other amendments that are important because there is a trapdoor to no deal at the end of 2020 that we need to deal with and close and we can do that in the legislation. And of course we need an amendment saying whatever deal gets through should be subject to a referendum.\u201d\n\nJohn McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, confirmed to Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge that Labour would back a second referendum amendment, probably proposed from the backbenches.\n\nHe said Johnson \u201cmay well be in contempt of parliament or the courts\u201d for having sent an additional letter to the EU arguing against a Brexit extension.\n\n\u201cNot signing the [extension request] letter? He\u2019s behaving a bit like a spoiled brat,\u201d he said.\n\nDominic Raab, the foreign secretary, was optimistic that Johnson had enough support to get his deal passed.\n\n\u201cWe seem to have the numbers in the House of Commons. Why hasn\u2019t parliament pushed this through? That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do this week,\u201d he told the Marr show. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a deal. Why would we have a second referendum?\u201d\n\nMichael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no deal planning, insisted the UK would be leaving on 31 October and an extension would not be necessary.", "description": "Shadow Brexit secretary goes further than party leader in saying Labour could back deal", "authors": ["Rowena Mason", "Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cf5584d2a5941da2a7fe2726fcac156f21ba579/199_158_4101_2460/master/4101.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9d17026c4093f3c05b86ee90bba2f284", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
