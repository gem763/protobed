So clearly it\u2019s come from them, it\u2019s in their style.\n\n\u201cIt reveals that there doesn\u2019t appear to be an actual plan at all. Instead, what they\u2019re doing is angrily, apparently, begging the EU not to support a delay which will be required because of the position that parliament has taken.\n\n\u201cAnd I urgently would ask the prime minister to take control of this and give us some clarity and some dignity and diplomacy on what is taking place.\u201d\n\nRudd added: \u201cFirst of all, government has consistently been saying since the Benn Act was passed that they have a cunning plan.\n\n\u201cAnd many of us have been confused by the idea of saying that they will obey the law but we are definitely leaving on October 31. And I don't think that this memo suggests that there is any plan.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing in fact is going down on one knee and begging EU members not to participate in this.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson is awaiting another ruling by the Court of Session, as it hears a request by campaigners for judges to empower the Scottish court to sign a Brexit extension letter if the prime minister refuses to do so.", "authors": ["Adam Forrest"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/06/23/boris-johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
