Add Interest\n\n\"I don't see a reason to not listen to the science,\" Thunberg told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \"It's not just a thing we should be taking for granted. We listen to the current best-available, united science. It's just something we should do. This is not political opinion or views, this is science.\"\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images\n\nThunberg, who has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, has attracted world-wide attention for encouraging global student-led strikes, known as \"Fridays for the Future.\" She's earned a celebrity reputation in the U.S. among young people, appearing on Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show\" and sharing a fist bump with former President Barack Obama during a visit on Tuesday.\n\nJust 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet\u2019s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she\u2019s unafraid to push for real action.

I wanted to do something about it.\"\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images\n\nRep. Garret Graves, R-La., said the U.S. has made strides in limiting climate emissions and that China was taking the lead in releasing carbon emissions known to contribute to climate change.\n\n\"For everyone one ton of carbon emissions we produce in the United States,\" Graves said during the hearing Wednesday. \"China has increased by 4 tons, more than offsetting all the reductions that we have had in the United States.\"\n\nThunberg responded that China's emissions levels shouldn't be an excuse for the U.S. to back off its own efforts to limit greenhouse gases.\n\n\"I want you to unite behind the science. And then I want you to take real action.\"\n\n\n\nSwedish climate activist Greta Thunberg appeared before Congress to urge lawmakers to \"listen to the scientists\" and embrace global efforts to reduce carbon emissions. https://t.co/Rik2UcuJDt pic.twitter.com/oEgGFdNsTu \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 18, 2019\n\n\"I am from Sweden, a small country. And there, it is the same argument. 'Why should we do anything, just look at the U.S.,' they say. So, just so you know, that is being used against you as well.\"\n\nKevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nThunberg traveled to the U.S. by sailing across the Atlantic Ocean to reduce her carbon footprint. She is expected to attend the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York City later this month.", "description": "Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish climate activist, has implored U.S. lawmakers to", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/greta-thunberg-01-gty-jef-190918_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
