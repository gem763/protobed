Members of the media came in from nearby Washington and from as far away as Germany to file into a packed room at Muhlenberg College to watch how a Democratic member of Congress might handle the fresh scrutiny.\n\nMost of the close to three dozen questions Wild fielded were about issues like health care, education, and the environment, reflecting what Washington Democrats have long insisted\u2014that the public doesn\u2019t care about impeachment as much as it cares about pocketbook issues.\n\nBut the evening\u2019s town hall made clear that in parts of the country like the politically contested Lehigh Valley, perhaps no issue has as much power to spark emotion like the impeachment of Trump.\n\nThin applause, for example, largely met Wild\u2019s emphasis that taking up impeachment was \u201cthe last thing in the world that I wanted\u201d when she won her seat in Congress. And polite silence was the audience\u2019s response to her reminder that when she was campaigning last year, she warned that impeachment would be \u201ca two-year distraction.\u201d\n\nBut loud applause, and a smattering of groans, drowned out Wild before she could finish her point that the precedent it would set for Congress to ignore Trump\u2019s contact with Ukraine would be unacceptable.\n\nThe reactions in the room reflect the tricky balancing act facing Wild and many of her swing-district Democratic colleagues around the country. The American public, as opinion polls show, is evenly divided on the question of impeachment, with few people truly undecided on the question. And there seemed to be few people undecided out of the nearly 300 who showed up on Wednesday night.\n\nAs the impeachment inquiry gains steam and the 2020 election draws nearer, the task of Democrats like Wild is to defend their impeachment inquiry, which many of them never really wanted, while keeping at bay those back home who want to see Democrats do more to go after Trump\u2014or want to see them give it up entirely.\n\nTim Bullard, a 64-year old writer from Allentown, asked Wild point blank if she had seen Trump\u2019s raucous press conference earlier on Wednesday\u2014during which he raged against his enemies\u2014and posited that Trump was obviously crazy. \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on the president\u2019s state of mind,\u201d said Wild.\n\nEarlier, Bullard had said the president needs to be removed from office but declined to go after Wild for not getting on board with impeachment earlier. \u201cEveryone can do a little better,\u201d he told The Daily Beast.\n\nMeanwhile, John Jaffe, a urologist from near Allentown, pressed Wild over Democrats\u2019 focus on impeachment, a question he could barely get through before being drowned out by boos. He later told The Daily Beast he is a longtime liberal who is frustrated with what he sees as Democrats\u2019 relentless, farcical attacks on Trump.\n\nWild, said Jaffe, faced significant risk in either holding off on impeachment or coming out in support of it. \u201cGiven the momentum in the Democrat Party toward impeachment, she couldn\u2019t not get on board,\u201d he said.\n\nLike many of the new crop of majority-making Democrats, Wild had been reluctant to back impeachment on the basis of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s findings, and she told reporters before her town hall that she believed the conduct Mueller outlined did not constitute an impeachable offense. At a town hall in August, she said, \u201cyou don\u2019t want to try a case where the facts are not all lined up and you\u2019re ready with all your evidence that you\u2019re going to introduce.\u201d\n\nBut for Wild, like many of her cohort, the Ukraine story changed the calculus dramatically. She became one of the 21 most vulnerable freshman Democrats to indicate support for impeachment in the wake of the whistleblower story. Her district, which is centered on the former steel country of the Lehigh Valley, was narrowly won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 but is home to areas that swung hard from Barack Obama to Trump in 2016.\n\nWild won by eight points in the 2018 midterms, but she\u2019s already drawn Republican challengers for 2020 and is one of three top GOP targets in the Keystone State, which is crucial to Trump\u2019s re-election hopes.\n\nTo some voters here, Wild\u2019s careful approach to impeachment is less of a political liability and more a reason to send her back to Washington. Sharon Listwa, a retired educator and registered Republican, told The Daily Beast she voted for Wild in 2018 and even knocked on doors for her.\n\n\u201cShe held her ground until she could no longer hold her ground,\u201d Listwa said of Wild\u2019s stance on impeachment. \u201cShe takes her time. None of this is shoot-from-the-hip.\u201d\n\nWhile Democrats publicly and privately worry how a protracted impeachment inquiry might affect their chances at taking the White House and holding the House, Wild said she hadn\u2019t thought about whether all this would make her reelection bid more difficult. But she did suggest that the party focuses on impeachment at its own peril\u2014something that may or may not satisfy devoted liberals here.\n\n\u201cI will tell you that I believe I will get re-elected on the basis of the work that I\u2019ve done for the district and for constituents, and not on how this impeachment issue goes one way or the other,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our job to make sure, No. 1, that it does not overshadow everything else that needs to get done,\u201d she went on, mentioning Democrats\u2019 efforts to pass legislation on infrastructure, prescription drug pricing, and others that have languished in partisan Washington. \u201cThat\u2019s our No. 1 job.\u201d", "description": "Rep.
