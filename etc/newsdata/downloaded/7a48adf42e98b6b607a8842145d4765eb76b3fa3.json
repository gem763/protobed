When I\u2019m not watching telly to review and I ought really to be doing something constructive, like clearing the gutters or fixing the sink, I\u2019ve been binge-watching old series of Richard Osman\u2019s House Of Games (BBC2).\n\nOf all the teatime quizzes, it\u2019s the flimsiest. It lacks the rigorous general knowledge questions of Eggheads or the mounting panic of The Chase.\n\nIt certainly doesn\u2019t have the baffling complexity of the Beeb\u2019s new afternoon quiz game with Rob Beckett, Head Hunter, on BBC1, which couldn\u2019t be more complicated if it came with subtitles in Croatian.\n\nIn fact, getting the answers right on House Of Games barely matters at all. Asked on Monday\u2019s show to guess the height of the tallest sandcastle ever built, former X Factor presenter Kate Thornton suggested three kilometres \u2014 more than a mile and three-quarters.\n\nWhen I\u2019m not watching telly to review and I ought really to be doing something constructive, like clearing the gutters or fixing the sink, I\u2019ve been binge-watching old series of Richard Osman\u2019s House Of Games (BBC2) (pictured)\n\nThat\u2019s what makes the game so relaxing to watch. Playing along at home, you can\u2019t possibly do worse than the celebrity guests.\n\nActor Ade Edmondson, one of the contestants as the series returned this week, started so badly that even punk rocker Vyvyan, his character from The Young Ones, would be ashamed of him.\n\nMost of the conundrums demand wild guesswork or a gift for tongue-twisters. Every day the contest ends with a round called Answer Smash, which involves a picture of someone famous and a trivia question: to score a point, you have to take both answers and squish them into one.\n\nFor example, a photo of the second man on the Moon, plus the question: \u2018Name the most famous dog in silent movies.\u2019 The answers are \u2018Buzz Aldrin\u2019 and \u2018Rin Tin Tin\u2019, so you win by saying: \u2018Buzz Aldrin-tin-tin.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s practically impossible, but not in the way that the fiendishly intellectual Only Connect is impossible. This is more of a party game \u2014 in fact, Osman could probably have a hit with a late-night version by getting his guests drunk first.\n\nBut the silliness isn\u2019t what makes it so addictive. What keeps me coming back is the way Osman subtly goads the players to be competitive, drowning them in charm then lobbing honeyed insults at them as they flounder around.\n\nOf all the teatime quizzes, it\u2019s the flimsiest. It lacks the rigorous general knowledge questions of Eggheads or the mounting panic of The Chase\n\nHe\u2019ll tell the losing players that they\u2019ve been desperately unlucky \u2014 then reacts with incredulity if they get a question right.\n\nWhen celebs are playing well, he\u2019ll praise them mockingly and then urge the others, in the nicest possible way, to gang up on the clever-clogs.\n\nIn his own way, Osman is as smarmy as Hughie Green or Bob Monkhouse ever were...but it\u2019s all a leg-pull and we\u2019re expected to know that. He means it most insincerely, folks.\n\nFor sheer insincerity, Fred Sirieix matches him on Snackmasters (C4). Holding up a Monster Munch crispy puff, he purred: \u2018Look at this work of art, look how beautiful it is.\u2019\n\nFor sheer insincerity, Fred Sirieix (pictured with Chef Daniel Clifford) matches him on Snackmasters (C4). Holding up a Monster Munch crispy puff, he purred: \u2018Look at this work of art, look how beautiful it is\u2019\n\nThen he popped it in his mouth and gasped at the way it dissolved to nothing: \u2018It\u2019s gone, just like the leg of a quail.\u2019 Snackmasters, which challenges two top chefs to replicate cheap, mass-produced packet food, is proving much more entertaining than you might expect.\n\nDaytime Delights Of The Week: Loads of new afternoon formats have launched this week, including the interior design challenge Your Room Or Mine? (C4) and the house-hunt show Escape To The Perfect Town (bbc1). Stay in and tuck in.\n\nThat\u2019s largely due to the demented competitiveness of the cooks.\n\nOne chef, Tristan Welch, who runs the upmarket Parker\u2019s Tavern in Cambridge, was so intent on winning that he bought a corn extruder, a sort of snack-squirting machine, from China . . . then hired a Chinese engineer to get it working.\n\nHe had to run the device in the car park, in case it blew up. You don\u2019t get that problem with quails\u2019 legs.", "description": "CHRISTOPHER STEVENS: When I'm not watching telly to review and I ought to be doing something constructive I've been binge-watching Richard Osman's House Of Games.", "authors": ["Christopher Stevens For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/01/19468598-0-image-a-164_1570581345583.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
