But the Estonian kept his cool, winning the maximum bonus points from the Wolf Power Stage.\n\nThierry Neauville was a close second, chasing Tanak's lead in his Hyundai i20. The Belgian hasn't had a win since April, and the dry spell continued on Sunday, but it was a respectable performance.\n\nMeanwhile, the reigning champion Sebastien Ogier, racing for Citroen, could only muster a third-place finish, a further 12.9 seconds behind. The Frenchman's chances of defending the title are dwindling, now that he trails Tanak by 28 points, with only two rallies left to race it out.", "description": "Ott Tanak is edging closer to his first World Rally Championship after winning the Rally GB in Wales.", "authors": ["Rachid Said Guerni"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/18/88/1000x563_cmsv2_3ae02686-8685-54ac-a8da-c009406e91db-4211888.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
