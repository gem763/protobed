As soon as I learned what happened I rushed to the hospital.\n\n'When I arrived I collapsed in the corridor, I couldn't believe what was happening. My mind was racing. I still feel like I'm in limbo.\n\n'To see your child go from running around and being active to this is heart breaking. Harvey just wants to come home and I'm desperate to make that happen. I just want my son back.'\n\nAfter the fall, Harvey managed to make his way upstairs to bed to rest, only to suffer a seizure moments later.\n\nHearing the commotion, Angela's partner Philip rushed in and called for an ambulance.\n\nIn the seven minutes it took paramedics to arrive, Harvey began struggling to breathe and was unable to communicate.\n\nParamedics blue-lighted him to the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan, where he was placed in an induced coma to relieve the pressure on his body.\n\nHarvey (pictured, on the left, with his brother Bradley, right, and their dogs, with Hugo on the left) was left unable to move from the neck down but has regained control of his right index finger\n\nHarvey was kept in a coma for four days, during which he was transferred to the spinal unit in Salford Royal Hospital.\n\nDoctors were initially unsure about any lasting damage, but after and MRI scan found that Harvey had suffered two mini strokes and one spinal stroke which resulted in injury to his vertebrae.\n\nFor the first couple of weeks, Harvey was even unable to eat, drink or talk by himself, instead relying on a feeding tube.\n\nAngela said: 'I remember the first time he spoke to us after the accident. Nurses removed his tube and he said hello to the whole family.\n\n'I broke down in tears of joy. I thought he would start improving in other areas too, that everything would go back to normal. So to be told that he would be paralysed for life was another blow.'\n\nDespite showing slight improvements, at the start of August, Harvey's body began to reject his catheter. The area became infected and his body went into septic shock.\n\nHis mother said: 'I thought we were going to lose him. It was the worst feeling, I was terrified.'\n\nHarvey has since been moved to Southport, where he remains under observation and receives regular physiotherapy. Four weeks ago, he regained the ability to move his right index finger.\n\nIt gave the family new hope, but after further tests, doctors couldn't find any signals going to the nerves in the left side of his body or legs and believe he'll never regain the ability to move.\n\nHarvey is due to remain in hospital for the next four months until doctors are happy enough with his progress.\n\nBut Angela has been told that her home is inadequate for him to return to and while the council have said they will pay for a hoist, special bed and dedicated wet room Angela believes it isn't enough.\n\nShe said: 'Because of his wheelchair he'd be trapped in his bedroom completely. I can't let that happen to him. He's only 17, it's not fair on him.'\n\nThe mother-of-two wants to convert their garage into a special bedroom for Harvey and convert the ground floor to an open plan design - allowing him to move from room to room by himself in his wheelchair.\n\nThe only other option for the family is to send Harvey to a care home full time but it's something his family are desperate to avoid.\n\nThe family have set up a Go Fund Me page called Bring Harvey home adaptations fund to gather the huge \u00a350,000 needed to adapt their home and have been overwhelmed by the support so far.\n\nAngela said: 'We didn't know something like this was going to happen, so we haven't got the savings to make the changes.\n\n'He's only 17 and because this kind of injury is rare for someone so young, he'd be in a home with older people.\n\n'He needs people his own age - he needs his family around him. Knowing that he might not be able to come home is having a negative effect on his mental health.\n\n'He's a mummy's boy, he's more like a 14 year old at heart and he just wants to come home. It's amazing the help we've received. But we still have a long way to go.'", "description": "Harvey Leyland (pictured) suffered a seizure at his home in Wigan, Greater Manchester, after his American bulldog yanked the cushion from underneath him and his spinal cord was crushed.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/12/19988390-0-image-a-33_1571658256822.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
