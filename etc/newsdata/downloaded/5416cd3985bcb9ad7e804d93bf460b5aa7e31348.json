Unfortunately, he paid the highest price.\"\n\nPHOTO: A father was shot to death by intruders inside his home where his wife and two small children were sleeping overnight in Fort Bend County, Texas, Oct. 16, 2019. (KTRK) More\n\nThe killers remained on the run on Sunday. A $25,000 reward was offered by the Fort Bend County Crime Stoppers for information leading to the arrests and prosecution of the killers.\n\nEstorffe's death sent shockwaves from the Lone Star State to Australia, where the headline in Estorffe's hometown newspaper, The Courier-Mail, screamed, \"Australian man, Brenton Estorffe, shot dead in Texas home while confronting intruders.\"\n\nDad of Brenton Estorffe arrives in Houston tasked with making funeral arrangements for his son https://t.co/YkpgvE0uOZ \u2014 The Courier-Mail (@couriermail) October 20, 2019\n\nFort Bend County Sheriff Troy Nehls requested the public's help in finding the owner of a light-colored, four-door sedan with a sunroof that was spotted on home security video arriving and speeding away from Estorffe's block around the time of the shooting. He said the tail lights on what he described as a \"vehicle of interest\" may not have been operating properly.\n\nNehls said at least a dozen investigators are working around the clock to solve the homicide of a \"loving husband and a loving father.\"\n\n\"He gave his life in defense of his family. What more honor can you bestow upon an individual than that,\" Nehls, a retired Army Reserve major and recipient of two Bronze Star medals, said of Estorffe.\n\n\"They're going to pay for this,\" Nehls said of the killers during a news conference on Friday, attended by Estorffe's widow, Angeleanna.\n\nStaring into a bank of news cameras, he told the killers to surrender, saying, \"You came into the wrong county.\"\n\n(MORE: Dad shot dead by home intruders; wife, 2 young kids survive unharmed)\n\nNehls said there could be more than two suspects involved in the homicide.\n\n\"There could have been another individual inside that vehicle of interest that might have been the getaway driver. We don't know,\" Nehls said.\n\nDet. Thomas Cantu, the lead investigator on the case, described the two intruders Estorffe confronted in his home. He said one was about 5-foot-11, had a medium build, a dark complexion and was wearing a dark-colored hoodie with the hood covering his head. He said the other intruder was about 6 feet tall, had a slender build, a dark complexion and a buzz-cut hairstyle.\n\nThe slaying unfolded just after midnight on Wednesday when Estorffe and his wife were startled awake by glass breaking at the rear of their home, Nehls said. Estorffe's children, 1-year-old Eliana and 3-year-old Asher, were asleep in the house.\n\n\"Try to put yourself through this: somebody breaks the glass. You hear glass breaking at the back of your home. Two individuals enter the home. They startle you. You wake up and then all of a sudden a confrontation takes place and then the next thing you hear are gunshots,\" Nehls said.\n\n\"Brenton gets up, confronts two individuals inside the residence, at which point in time he was shot and killed,\" Nehls said. \"Brenton was there to protect his family.\"\n\nHe said Estorffe's wife and neighbors called 911. Estorffe was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Security video of a car speeding from the Texas home of a father gunned down on his 29th birthday while defending his wife and two young children from intruders was released by authorities desperate to identify the suspects and bring them to justice.
