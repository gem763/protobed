A judge has now ordered the release of 27 of the suspects. Pictured is the police raid\n\nAuthorities have found 42 skulls so far and are still investigating where they came from.\n\nSome of the skulls were covered in blood, which an unnamed specialist believes is the result of a Santeria ritual performed to avoid arrest.\n\nSanteria is an Afro-American religion of Yoruba origin. The word means worship of saints and is influenced by and syncretised with Roman Catholicism. Some rituals linked with Santeria involve praying to and giving offerings to Santa Muerte (Saint Death).\n\nLocal resident Martha N reportedly claimed that the members of the La Union Tepito gang carried out satanic rituals every three days in order to receive good fortune in their alleged criminal activity and become 'immune' to bullets.\n\nInvestigators also discovered knives, 40 jawbones, the fetus and 30 leg or arm bones at the site, the office said. It was not yet clear whether the fetus was human, the spokeswoman said.\n\nThe arrests were made during a raid on five houses in the colonies of Peralvillo and Tepito, in the municipality of Cuauhtemoc, in Mexico City, Mexican capital in a joint operation between the Secretary of the Citizen Security, the General Prosecution of the State and the Army of Mexico.\n\nSome of the skulls were covered in blood, which an unnamed specialist believes is the result of a Santeria religious ritual performed to avoid arrest.
