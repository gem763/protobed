As a member of the cabinet diplomatically described it, \"things are self-evidently bad\".\n\nThe strategy of suspending Parliament to try to stop the anti-no deal legislation didn't work. Then threatening Tory MPs who might vote that way didn't work - they stuck to their guns even though they knew they would be chucked out of their party.\n\nAnd it is far from certain that the Labour Party and the other opposition parties will agree to the next tactic of holding a general election as soon as possible.\n\nAnd we saw Boris Johnson, who normally seems to charge his batteries when he is on the road, struggle to deal with a heckler on a Yorkshire high street.\n\nSeeing that happen was like a premonition of what would happen in an election campaign.\n\nThe PM was challenged, first by a voter who asked politely \"Please leave our town\", then more aggressively by a man furious about Johnson's Brexit plan. But then, within five minutes, the prime minister appealed to the crowd to back him on Brexit, and it was clear in that moment, on that high street, more voters were with him, than against. That is despite the spiky and vocal objections and the trouble that he seems to attract.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boris Johnson says he and his brother Jo \"haven't seen eye-to-eye for a long time\" about the EU\n\nBut there is no way that No 10 can be sure that will be remain the case if he goes on to fight the election he so desires.\n\nAnd there is deep worry in the cabinet that the prime minister has quite simply picked the wrong strategy.\n\nSeveral have warned privately of serious unease about the path that's been chosen by Number 10 - alienating moderates, riding roughshod over any convention, speeding into a strategy that looks like running into a brick wall at 100mph.\n\nTory MPs in the middle, who backed Boris Johnson in the hope that he could unite them at least, fret now that they are all in trouble. One said: \"This was NOT the plan.\"\n\nBoris Johnson has, of course, been written off on so many occasions before. He still seems wedded to the strategy that won over Tory members - stick to the Brexit deadline, pursue clarity at almost any cost, don't worry about what he once described as plaster off the ceiling.\n\nThat was the political calculation that got him to Number 10. That's what, for now, still makes sense in his inner circle. But some Tories, including some of those who backed him, now fear that political strategy might cause more trouble than it was worth.\n\nOne cabinet minister says it is just as feasible that Boris Johnson's fortunes will rise again next week as it is that the mess will get worse.\n\nBut Downing Street must be in no doubt now that they have little on which to rely.", "description": "The strategy was clear - but the cabinet is worried that it might be wrong.", "authors": ["Laura Kuenssberg", "Political Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07ml427.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
