The woman, with whom Mr. Rubin had been having an extramarital relationship, said he coerced her into performing oral sex in a hotel room in 2013, according to two company executives with knowledge of the episode. Google investigated and concluded her claim was credible, said the people, who spoke on the condition that they not be named, citing confidentiality agreements. Mr. Rubin was notified, they said, and Mr. Page asked for his resignation.\n\nGoogle could have fired Mr. Rubin and paid him little to nothing on the way out. Instead, the company handed him a $90 million exit package, paid in installments of about $2 million a month for four years, said two people with knowledge of the terms. The last payment is scheduled for next month.", "description": "The internet giant paid Mr. Rubin $90 million and praised him, while keeping silent about a misconduct claim.", "authors": ["Daisuke Wakabayashi", "Katie Benner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/20/business/20GOOGLE01/00GOOGLE01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-25"}
