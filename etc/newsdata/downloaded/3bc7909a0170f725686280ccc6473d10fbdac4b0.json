Yes, I Still Feel Insecure", "language": "en", "text": "Isabelle Daza is a Filipino actress, model, and social media influencer with almost 3 million Instagram followers. Last year, she talked about her struggle with anxiety and mental health in a speech she shared on her Instagram page. The video went viral and made headlines. Since then, she has spoken about fighting the stigma of mental health in public forums and vlogs.\n\nI start my days with a mental fitness routine. It goes like this: I say three things that I\u2019m grateful for, then look at myself in the mirror and recite affirmations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t devalue myself by constructive self-criticism. I have kind and warm regards for people at all times. I\u2019m inner-directed and I allow others the same freedom. I am enough. I am beautiful. I am happy. I am brave.\u201d\n\nI say them to myself and sometimes to my 1-year-old son before a 10-minute meditation. It\u2019s not always easy. On most days, the first thing I really want to do in the morning is to grab my phone, check my messages, and scroll through Instagram.\n\nPhone addiction is real. And we don\u2019t understand that it\u2019s pounding our mental health. There was a time when I didn\u2019t even open my eyes upon waking up, my hands would just instantly reach for my phone.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize this until I gave birth to my son last year. A lot of my friends visited me at home, poured out their feelings, and talked about what they were going through. It turns out, many of them were struggling with their mental health. I was too.\n\nI watched people on social media as I struggled with the 65 pounds I gained during pregnancy. Fellow models had new endorsements, others were travelling, while I was stuck. I felt anxious and was doubting my new life as a mother. \u201cWhat am I doing here? Is this really what I want?\u201d I thought, fully aware that I had a beautiful family.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Isabelle Daza.\n\nI couldn\u2019t even look at myself in the mirror. I\u2019d be so sad and my husband would tell me that weight is just temporary, that it\u2019s something superficial. \u201cIf you\u2019re not happy about that, just do something about it but also be kind to yourself,\u201d he said.\n\nIt took a while for me to believe this but eventually did when I started to open up about my anxiety. It started when one of my friends whose son went through depression invited me to talk about mental health for an event. I didn\u2019t want to at first because I was scared to go up on stage and show my vulnerability but I did it. It took a lot of courage to say that I\u2019m actually what I\u2019m not on social media. This is the real me.\n\nOpening up so publicly during the talk helped me understand myself but posting a video of my speech on social media was rewarding in a different way. Not because of the likes, but because it has helped others with their struggles too.\n\nOne time while I was out having lunch, a bunch of ladies who were around 60 or 70 years old sent me food. When they were done with their meal, they came up to me and one of them said, \u201cYou know what, your video is the name of our chat group now. \u2018It\u2019s okay to not be okay\u2019,\u201d she said, quoting the title of my speech. She was almost in tears.\n\nI was so shocked to find out that my video transcended generations. I thought I was only speaking to millennials.\n\nThis taught me a lot about humility.\n\nI learned on social media that humility is learned the hard way. Sometimes, when you think you\u2019re on top of the world, just one post can make everyone hate you. But I also found out that humility is not always about putting yourself down, it is acknowledging that you\u2019re beautiful and saying you\u2019re beautiful as well.\n\nDon\u2019t dim your light in order for other people to shine, that\u2019s not humility.\n\nI eventually went to see a therapist. She told me that I have to know I\u2019m enough so that my son will grow up to know that he\u2019s enough. That\u2019s what really changed my attitude. She taught me to look at myself in the mirror again and told me about the importance of morning affirmations.\n\n\u201cYou have to tell yourself \u2018you\u2019re beautiful, you\u2019re enough, you\u2019re happy,\u2019\u201d she said. I found it so stupid but she told me to just do it. So I did.\n\nAfter brushing my teeth, I would tell myself that I\u2019m beautiful, that I\u2019m enough, and that I\u2019m happy. I did it for two weeks and from there I saw the change. Telling myself I was enough made me feel I was enough. I started to have a different perspective on life and slowly became more grateful. I was happier. It may seem so stupid but the power of words is so important.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Isabelle Daza.\n\nSeeing a therapist has taught me a lot and it\u2019s something I now advocate. I\u2019m very open to asking for help because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something to be ashamed about. This goes against Filipino culture, which tells us to always hide our weaknesses and put on a brave face.\n\n\u201cBumili ka nalang ng pizza (Just buy pizza)\u201d or \u201cOK lang \u2018yan, iiyak lang \u2018yan. Tomorrow it will be fine. (That\u2019s OK, just cry it out, tomorrow it will be fine),\u201d is what people usually say when you talk about your mental health. Many forget that anxiety is a real thing. For me, it\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re drowning in a wave that\u2019s constantly keeping you there, and you\u2019re trying to get out of the wave and nobody can help you, because nobody sees the wave and nobody sees the symptoms.\n\nThis is why my friends and I have decided to launch a website about mental health. We want to change the words associated with it. When you say \u201cmental health\u201d people think depression or baliw (crazy) but really, it\u2019s about exercising the brain to become fit. If we\u2019re getting our bodies fit why don\u2019t we do the same thing to our mind?\n\nI\u2019m still constantly on social media looking at what I don\u2019t have, seeing what everyone else has, but going to therapy is a way for me to exercise my mind and go back to what really matters.", "description": "It took a lot of courage to say that I\u2019m actually what I\u2019m not on social media.
