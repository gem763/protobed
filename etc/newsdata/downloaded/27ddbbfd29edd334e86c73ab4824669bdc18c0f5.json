Children and families submit such requests due to severe medical conditions like cancer, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, and cystic fibrosis,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"In many cases, the treatments are life-saving.\"\n\nThey said letters sent out by USCIS in early August summarily denying the requests gave people 33 days to leave the country, and said they face forcible removal and denial of future visas if they did not comply.\n\nThe decision caused fear and confusion, the lawmakers said, warning it could force people to return to countries where lack of necessary medical care threatened their lives. They asked DHS, USCIS and ICE to answer a list of 14 detailed questions about the policy shift.\n\nThe agency sent out letters in early August informing those who had requested deferred action about the new policy, but providing few details on how to submit requests with ICE.\n\nDeferred action is a discretionary determination to temporarily postpone the removal from the United States of a person who is illegally present, and occurs on a case-by-case basis, factoring in medical conditions and other circumstances.\n\nUSCIS said those denied requests that were pending on Aug. 7 did not have removal orders pending, and had not been targeted for deportation.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by David Gregorio)", "description": "The Trump administration, facing criticism over deportations from lawmakers and civil rights groups, said on Monday it would reopen consideration of some deferral requests for compelling circumstances such as medical conditions.
