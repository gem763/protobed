I don't even bother trying [to park in disabled spots] in public,' she said.\n\nThe 27-year-old said that having the distance lessened would make all the difference and that it is 'unfair' they weren't granted disability parking.\n\nShe said it was a 'kick in the guts' when they were denied the pass.\n\n'It is absolute bull***, I have to tell her when there's a step, I have to tell her when there's a ditch or any obstacle in her way, if I don't do that she'll trip and hurt herself,' she said.\n\n'I'm trying to get awareness out there that vision impaired people need the parking even for the safety side of things.'\n\nMs Blennerhassett lives in fear that her daughter could walk into traffic if they are at a distance from where they need to be\n\nCurrently Queensland's disability parking permits are given to people who require 24/7 access to wheelchairs as they can't walk, and people whose ability to walk has been severely restricted due to a medical condition or disability they've had for more than six months.\n\nMedical conditions and disabilities have to be certified by a doctor or occupational therapist.\n\nA Transport and Main Roads Minister told Daily Mail Australia: 'Following community feedback, Transport and Main Roads is currently assessing the feasibility of expanding the Australian Disability Parking Permit Scheme criteria to include people with vision impairment.\n\n'We commissioned an independent consultant to undertake the review, which has involved consultation with community, government and disability sector stakeholders.'", "description": "Despite her daughter's severe condition - which means she has to use a cane to get around - Ms Blennerhassett was denied a permit to use disabled parks in Queensland.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni", "Claudia Poposki For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/21/19805840-0-image-a-2_1571257555328.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
