This operating system is based on Linux, the free and open source operating system that's ubiqitious in server rooms and data centers around the world.\n\nIDC President Crawford Del Prete told Business Insider said Oracle \"needs excitement and developers on its platform.\"\n\n\"This is a smart way to bring development to the platform from enterprise customers who want to develop on Linux,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe announcement highlights a key theme of Oracle's strategy to expand its presence in the cloud, the creation of a new cloud model based on automation technology and AI. Last year, the company unveiled the Oracle Autonomous Database, which it said will not require any human-based management.\n\nAt this year's OpenWorld, Ellison took another jab at Amazon Web Services, quipping that Oracle's autonomous approach to the cloud might protect users from themselves \u2014 as in the case of Capital One, where user error allegedly allowed an attacker to breach an Amazon cloud server and steal personal information from millions of customers.\n\n\"No human labor. No human error. No data loss,\" Ellison said, in an apparent reference to the Capital One hack. \"That's a big difference between us and AWS.\"\n\nEllison capped his presentation by announcing that Oracle is giving free access to its cloud infrastructure and autonomous database. This means, organizations, including developers, students and educators will be able to build networks and use application on the company's platform.\n\n\"This is our best stuff,\" Ellison said.\n\nGot a tip about Oracle or another tech company?
