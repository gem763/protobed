After playing it regularly for two weeks, my colleague Andrew Webster noted in his review that Ring Fit Adventure is an easy way to fit physical activity into your life. But it\u2019s got another perk, one that Nintendo developers probably didn\u2019t intend for (and don\u2019t condone): the mini-games are perfect party games, best played when everyone\u2019s a little tipsy. In my experience, it might even be more fun to play with a crowd than Super Mario Party.\n\nThe issue with Super Mario Party is that it\u2019s not really made for spontaneous play \u2014 if you want to play with more than two people, you have to plan ahead, and someone has to bring extra controllers. But if you\u2019re hosting a party and you own Ring Fit Adventure, all it takes for a good time is to whip out the ring controller and leg strap, which can be passed around to each player when it\u2019s their turn. The mini-games, 12 in all, are each about a minute long, so it doesn\u2019t take long for everyone to have a chance to play. You can quickly adjust the ring\u2019s strength settings while you\u2019re playing the games, to even the playing field for users of different sizes and strengths. There\u2019s no strategy involved, so there\u2019s less of a chance for friendships to be destroyed, as is the risk with Super Mario Party. Instead, Ring Fit Adventure\u2019s mini-games encourage competition at its most basic, physical form, asking, \u201cwho can score the most points by squeezing a ring the best?\u201d\n\nEach game focuses on working out different parts of the body. For example, Bootstrap Tower has you climbing a tower by squeezing the ring and flinging it down to propel yourself up, targeting the chest. Thigh Rider has you sitting down and squeezing the ring between your legs to control a vehicle through an obstacle course, and you start to feel the burn after a while. The games\u2019 objectives are to collect as many coins or points as you can, and at the end, there\u2019s a leaderboard that tracks everyone\u2019s scores. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t let you input new names, but saves the rankings to users on the Switch, so make sure to add everyone to the device if you want to let the records show who\u2019s really the best at blasting their pecs. There\u2019s also an option to connect online, so you can compare your scores with players worldwide.\n\nOf course, Ring Fit Adventure isn\u2019t marketing itself as a party game, and it would need more than 12 mini-games to do so. But the ones that are included are so chaotically fun to play and watch others play, you can\u2019t help but want more. My personal favorite, Squattery Wheel, where you\u2019re given a pottery vase to replicate by squatting while squeezing the ring, could easily be a Super Mario Party mini-game. Robo-Wrecker, a \u201cwhack-a-mole\u201d game that has you smashing little robots all around you by pushing and pulling the ring, is loud and rambunctious in the best way. And then there\u2019s games like Crate Crasher, where you shoot off blasts to destroy as many crates as you can. They\u2019re simple enough that they\u2019d be dull if you were sitting and playing with a controller \u2014 but are great for parties when your body is the controller. You have to be willing to look very silly doing the exercises, running in place or flinging your arms around, but then again, it\u2019s not a real party until everyone\u2019s getting a little silly.\n\nGrid View Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge", "description": "Nintendo\u2019s Ring Fit Adventure, the spiritual successor to the Wii Fit for the Switch, is a genuinely fun way to work up a sweat.
