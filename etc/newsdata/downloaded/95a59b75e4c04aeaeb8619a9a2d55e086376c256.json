The past couple of weeks, I'm having a terrible episode, to where I'm really not sure I want to go on living. I know I need to see a therapist, but I've gone down the list of therapists in my insurance provider's directory and I can't get anyone to return my calls. I've called and left messages for over a dozen so far and I can't get an appointment.\n\nI no longer live in the state where my original doctor was years ago, so I can't see her anymore. I can't afford to pay out of pocket. I don't have any friends or family who can or are willing to help me make calls and find someone.\n\nIt was so hard to get motivated to do this to begin with, and I'm at the verge of just giving up entirely. Is there anything else I can do?\n\n\u2014 At the Verge\n\nAt the Verge: I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re in the midst of a bad episode.\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/for The Washington Post)\n\n\u25cfYou can send a quick text to 741741 \u2014 the Crisis Text Line \u2014 to be connected to a volunteer staffer. There\u2019s a more detailed explanation here: crisistextline.org/texting-in.\n\n\u25cfIf you have suicidal thoughts, then please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, 800-273-8255. Keep the number handy. More information: suicidepreventionlifeline.org.\n\n\u25cfDon\u2019t wait for a therapist; call your primary care doctor. Right away. Request a sick appointment \u2014 i.e., immediate \u2014 get an evaluation, learn what treatment options you have while you look for a therapist.\n\n\u25cfYour regular doctor may also be able to get past barriers to your seeing a therapist. I\u2019ve experienced it myself: I call specialists, and they\u2019re scheduling six months out; my doctor\u2019s office calls for me, and I\u2019m in next week. It\u2019s not true every time, but enough to make it worth trying.\n\n\u25cfIf you haven\u2019t called your out-of-state \u201coriginal doctor,\u201d then do so. Some practitioners will do video consultations with prior patients.\n\n\u25cfIf this is all too daunting \u2014 health care is a lot to manage even for people who aren\u2019t depressed \u2014 pick one contact and try it now: your primary care physician if you have one, the crisis text line if you don\u2019t.\n\nFinally, so important, don\u2019t let yourself forget that depression responds to treatment and you have managed yours successfully in the past. Do not treat as permanent a crisis that is temporary: It is a symptom of depression to believe it won\u2019t go away.\n\nTake care, and trust yourself to get through this.\n\nRe: Depression: I feel for the person struggling to find help because I've been there. Depression has a way of making even the most basic tasks insurmountable. Frustrating tasks like finding a therapist are even worse.\n\nI don't have any silver bullet, or even any actionable advice. I just want them to know they are not alone. That there are people who understand what you are going through. And I hope they can see that every time they make a call is a triumph over the illness. Some days, that's all you can handle, or you might not be able to handle even that much, and that's okay, too. Some days you have more spoons than others.\n\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\nAnonymous: Amen.
