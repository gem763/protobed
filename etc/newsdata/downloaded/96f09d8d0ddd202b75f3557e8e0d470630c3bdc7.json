Hinch will bring back Zack Greinke - creating a rematch of Game 1, won by the Yankees, 7-0.\n\nHouston's Justin Verlander is now scheduled to pitch on regular rest against the Yankees' James Paxton in Friday's Game 5.\n\nIf there's a Game 6, it could be a bullpen battle for both clubs, with the Yankees possibly going to J.A. Happ for length. And a Game 7, if necessary, could be a rematch of Luis Severino and Gerrit Cole on regular rest.\n\nPete Caldera is the Yankees beat writer for NorthJersey.com.
