Fenech, also known as the 'Marrickville Mauler', is one of Australia's most high-profile fighters. He represented Australia at the 1984 Summer Olympics in the United States as boxing captain - the same year he started in the sport. Despite disappointment at the Olympics, Fenech quickly cemented his status as a professional boxer. However by 1987 he started to feel pain in his hands - and wanted to leave the sport. Fenech was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2002. Fenech trained Mike Tyson when the world heavyweight champion decided to come out of retirement.\n\nAlthough her father won't be able to walk her down the aisle, Jessica made it clear in a Twitter post that his health came first.\n\n'Love you so much dad, we are all praying for you and thinking of you every single second that goes by and will be right by your side as soon as you open your eyes! You are so strong ! You are a fighter! Love you to death,' the tweet read.\n\nPhotographs show a loving Fenech smiling with his children and wife.\n\nIn one image, Fenech is seen grinning at the camera with all three of his children.\n\nHe is understood to not have been aware of the severity of his heart problem and had ignored discomfort for several days before falling ill.\n\nHe finally gave in when his boxing colleagues grew increasingly worried and insisted he go to hospital.\n\n'I rang him up and he wasn't going to let me in the room. Then one of us realised we had a spare key and we had to go up there and say: \"Jeff, we rang an ambulance,\"' trainer Basil Nassis said.", "description": "Boxing legend Jeff Fenech underwent surgery on Tuesday night after antibiotics failed to fix an infected valve leading to his heart", "authors": ["Aidan Wondracz For Daily Mail Australia", "Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/00/19466808-0-image-a-3_1570576134968.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
