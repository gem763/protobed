When it was over, Jones had tallied 4 total touchdowns and led a second-half rally to secure a 32-31 victory in his NFL debut.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Bucs looked poised to spoil the moment, but kicker Matt Gay missed a would-be game-winning 34-yard field goal wide right as time expired.\n\nJones leads game-winning drive\n\nJones capped the second-half rally by leading the game-winning touchdown drive that started at the Giants 25-yard line with 3:16 remaining.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nHe methodically marched the Giants down the field before scrambling seven yards for the score on a busted pass play on fourth-and-five to take the lead with 1:16 left.\n\nBucs rally falls short\n\nThe Bucs answered by getting into field goal range thanks in large part to a 44-yard connection from Jameis Winston to Mike Evans. But Gay\u2019s miss ensured that Jones\u2019 debut would be a complete success.\n\nStory continues\n\nJones ended the day with a 112.7 passer rating, completing 23-of-36 attempts for 336 yards and a pair of touchdowns through the air. He also led the Giants in rushing with 28 yards on four rushes that included a pair of touchdowns.\n\nHe lost two fumbles on sacks that amounted to his only blemishes on an otherwise outstanding debut.\n\nDaniel Jones' Giants debut was a rousing success. (Reuters)\n\nBarkley injured\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all good news in New York, as running back Saquon Barkley left the game in the first half and returned to the sideline in a walking boot after halftime, ruled out with a sprained ankle. X-Rays were negative, and he\u2019s scheduled for an MRI on Monday.\n\nBut even an injury to the Giants\u2019 most talented player couldn\u2019t dampen the spirits of Jones\u2019 coming-out party.\n\nJones shows off wheels\n\nJones showed to be an immediate upgrade over Eli Manning in the ground game for his first NFL score.\n\nFacing second-and-goal from the seven-yard line early in the second quarter, the Giants drew up an option play for Jones. He faked a handoff to Barkley and ran to the right past a pair of hopelessly chasing Bucs defenders to find the corner of the end zone.\n\nDaniel Jones showed the Bucs that his mobility is going to be a problem for opposing defenses. (Getty)\n\nThe score cut Tampa\u2019s lead to 12-10 and marked a milestone for Jones with a play that Manning almost certainly wouldn\u2019t have made.\n\nIt was Jones\u2019 second successful run play of the drive after he scrambled for 11 yards on a third-and-five to keep the scoring drive alive.\n\nThere are a lot of questions about what Jones will bring to the Giants after Manning manned the position for 15-plus seasons. But there\u2019s little doubt he\u2019ll add a mobile dynamic replacing a quarterback who\u2019s tallied a total of seven rushing touchdowns over the course of his career.\n\nRookie mistake\n\nJones followed up his touchdown with a costly turnover two possessions later. On first-and-10 at the Giants 45, Jones faced pressure and fumbled on a sack from Tampa Bay linebacker Shaq Barrett. It was one of four sacks on the day for Barrett, two of which forced fumbles from Jones.\n\nTampa Bay recovered and scored three plays later on a 20-yard touchdown pass from Jameis Winston to Mike Evans to take a 25-10 lead.\n\nJones\u2019 1st passing touchdown is a doozy\n\nJones didn\u2019t take any time to log his first passing touchdown in the second half, finding tight end Evan Engram for a 75-yard touchdown on the first first play from scrimmage.\n\nWith Barkley sidelined, the Giants let Jones rip on a play-action fake to running back Wayne Gallman. He found a streaking Engram 15 yards downfield over the middle. Engram did the rest, outracing Bucs defenders down the sideline to secure Jones\u2019 first score through the air.\n\n.@Daniel_Jones10\u2019s 1st career passing TD is a good one. @eazyengram takes it 75 yards to the \ud83c\udfe0! #GiantsPride #NYGvsTB\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: FOX\n\n\ud83d\udcf1: NFL app // Yahoo Sports app\n\nWatch FREE on mobile: https://t.co/qnNxI5gZ8j pic.twitter.com/4SUz5X19kK \u2014 NFL (@NFL) September 22, 2019\n\nA completion to Sterling Shepard for the two-point conversion cut Tampa Bay\u2019s lead to 28-18.\n\nJones shows off big arm to set up second passing TD\n\nJones continued to impress on the next Giants drive, showing off his mobility and big arm on a deep pass to fellow rookie Darius Slayton.\n\nFacing pressure from Carl Nassib on first-and-10 at the 50, Jones stepped up in the pocket to find Slayton streaking down the middle on a post route. He launched a bomb 40 yards in the air that Slayton corralled before being dragged down at the four-yard line.\n\nTwo plays later, Jones found Shepard on the right sideline in the end zone, lofting a perfect pass over double coverage for the touchdown to cut Tampa Bay\u2019s lead to 28-25.\n\nThe Bucs responded with a field goal for their only score of the second half, eventually setting up Jones for the first game-winning touchdown drive of his NFL career.\n\nVindication for Gettleman?\n\nThe drafting of Jones and benching of Manning after Week 2 both arrived with, fanfare, much of it negative.\n\nGettleman, who made the controversial decision to draft Jones at No. 6, has taken a considerable amount of heat, much of it warranted.\n\nBut Jones\u2019 performance on Sunday is a satisfying slice of vindication for the embattled Giants general manager. He\u2019s made his fair share of questionable calls. But with Jones, all signs point to his getting this one right.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Somewhere, Dave Gettleman is smiling.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xUbGJYVAFPM9dQ3vkmZtsA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fdNt_WJWQx2d4hmLhGZsCw--~B/aD0yNTY3O3c9Mzg1MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/c875d870-dd96-11e9-9fbf-463a99530724", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
