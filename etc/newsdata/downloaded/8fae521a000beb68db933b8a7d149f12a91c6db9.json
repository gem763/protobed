The glitch - which was first brought to light by InsideEVs and later reported by Business Insider - appears to not only be preventing the screen from turning on, but also won\u2019t let the car charge.\n\nIt\u2019s more or less a worse case scenario for someone who owns such a digitally-reliant car. Here are the details.\n\nAs evidenced by the army of bot-like social media accounts that yell at anyone who dare criticises Elon Musk or Tesla, many people love their Teslas. But, the caveat there is most people love their new Teslas. The vast majority of Teslas on the road today are less than four years old. So we really don\u2019t know how well they hold up. Which brings us to the aforementioned BI report.\n\nHere\u2019s more detail from Business Insider:\n\nThe issue concerns a flash storage chip, called the eMMC, that\u2019s embedded on a piece of onboard technology called the MCU1. Flash storage is form of computer memory that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed to help a computer perform tasks quickly and efficiently. It is often used in computers, USB drives, digital cameras, and networking hardware. According to multiple repair professionals, Teslas are writing vehicle logs to this flash storage chip so frequently that the chip stops working properly.\n\nFrankly, this sounds a bit like an own goal from Tesla which didn\u2019t consider the long term ramifications of its data hoarding:\n\nExplaining the problem in more detail, [Tesla repair professional Phil] Sadow said: \u201c[Tesla] creates so many logs in the car, they write to [the chip] so fast that it basically burns them out. They have a finite amount of writes; they can only do so many writes. The amount of logging they\u2019re doing is excessive.\n\nTesla did not comment on BI\u2019s story or respond to our inquiry before publication, but according to the experts BI quotes, it sounds like the four year mark is about when the issue crops up.\n\nIn response to a tweet about the issue, Elon Musk issued a cryptic message:\n\nShould be much better at this point \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 12, 2019\n\nWhat is much better? At what point? Who knows!\n\nIn any case, here\u2019s to hoping Tesla resolves the issue quickly, because four years ago they weren\u2019t even selling 10,000 cars a quarter. Obviously, a lot has changed since then, and making sure Teslas are not only impressive cars in Year One, but also in Year Five not to mention Year Ten, could prove one of the biggest questions facing the company going forward.\n\nThis story originally appeared on Jalopnik.", "description": "There are mounting reports of a serious issue affecting the flash storage onboard older Teslas.
