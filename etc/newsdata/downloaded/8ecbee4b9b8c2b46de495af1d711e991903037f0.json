In its announcement, Wells Fargo said Scharf would oversee the bank from New York, where his family is based.\n\nScharf was the CEO of San Francisco-based Visa Inc (V) from 2012 to 2016, when he abruptly resigned from the company, saying that he felt he could \u201cno longer spend time in San Francisco necessary to do the job effectively.\u201d\n\nShortly after leaving Visa, Scharf was recruited to head the Bank of New York Mellon (BK), where he served as CEO.\n\nAlthough Scharf will not have to move across the country for the new job, analysts are wondering if he will be able to run the company effectively from almost 3,000 miles away.\n\n\u201cI think Charlie Scharf is a solid appointment but not a perfect one,\u201d said Portales Partners LLC\u2019s Charles Peabody on Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move. Peabody said Scharf\u2019s issues with Visa, despite the advent of video conferencing and communications, could carry over to his new responsibilities at Wells Fargo.\n\nScharf addressed analysts on a conference call Friday morning, in which the second question was about his cross-country work arrangement. Scharf said Wells Fargo\u2019s presence, with corporate offices across the U.S., means that he would not have spent much time in the San Francisco office even if he relocated there.\n\n\u201cI don't think anyone would ever say in the places I've worked that I've not been present,\u201d Scharf said. \u201cI think it's just the opposite.\u201d\n\nTurnaround effort underway\n\nScharf\u2019s unique challenge with Wells Fargo is repairing the reputation of a company damaged by a series of scandals over the past few years.\n\nIn 2016, Wells Fargo paid fines for opening millions of fake deposit and credit card accounts without customers\u2019 consent. In the time that followed, the company faced other fines for improperly repossessing servicemembers\u2019 cars and squeezing customers on auto insurance policies they had never signed up for.\n\nIn February 2018, the Federal Reserve announced an unprecedented asset cap on Wells Fargo\u2019s growth, citing \u201cwidespread consumer abuses and compliance breakdowns.\u201d\n\nIn July, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wells Fargo\u2019s problems are \u201cdeep-seated\u201d and will not be \u201cfixed quickly,\u201d suggesting that the bank is still some time from having its asset cap lifted.\n\nWells Fargo hopes that hiring Scharf will finally bring some stable leadership to the company, which saw the ouster of CEO John Stumpf in 2016 and then the departure of Tim Sloan in March of this year. Since March, the bank\u2019s general counsel C. Allen Parker had been serving as interim CEO.\n\nBanking background\n\nCharles Scharf, Chairman and CEO, BNY Mellon, speaks at the 2019 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., April 30, 2019.

In 1987 he joined Commercial Credit, the consumer finance company helmed by Jamie Dimon and Sandy Weill (who would go on to head JPMorganChase and Citigroup, respectively).\n\nScharf told analysts Friday that the businesses at Wells Fargo are \u201cextraordinary\u201d and said the company has a \u201cdamn good base\u201d to build from in getting past its regulatory issues.\n\n\u201cWe know we have a series of regulatory issues that we need to complete the work on, that is clearly the first priority,\u201d Scharf said. Per its agreement with regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency gave Wells Fargo the green light on Scharf\u2019s appointment to become the next CEO.\n\nScharf has his work cut out for him.
