She even went as far as to rate one particular sexual encounter a \u2018nine out of ten on the naughty scale\u2019.\n\nShe later alleges that Danny ended up smuggling her into the England rugby team hotel at Pennyhill Park so they could have sex, with her later \u2018hiding behind a plant pot\u2019 so the rest of the team did not notice her leaving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe TV personality also recalled that Danny gave her what she believed to be \u2018the greatest kiss of all time\u2019. Writing in her book, Lizzie said: \u2018I remember thinking I had never ever been kissed like that in my entire life, and in that first initial moment, I realised what I had been missing all those years.\u2019\n\nHowever, Danny\u2019s lawyers have stated that he did not consent for this to be published, and he now wants \u00a350,000 worth of damages from Soho Friday Media.\n\nSoho Friday Media have now hit back at the legal action being taken, claiming that Lizzie was \u2018extremely nice and complimentary\u2019 toward Danny in the book.\n\n\u2018Lizzie was extremely nice and complimentary about Danny and is surprised at his reaction as she only told the half of it,\u2019 they said in a statement. \u2018We are now dealing with it with our lawyers.\u2019\n\nLizzie\u2019s publishers have stated that Lizzie was \u2018extremely nice and complimentary\u2019 toward Danny in her book (Picture: PA)\n\nLizzie also told Mail Online that she supported what the publishers have said, claiming that she and Danny had \u2018great chemistry\u2019 when they were together.\n\n\u2018I was surprised to hear Danny wants to sue my publishers for saying he was good in bed,\u2019 she stated. \u2018I was very complimentary and kind in my book about Danny.\n\n\u2018I helped him tremendously and he got me through a tough divorce. It\u2019s in the hands of lawyers now who have all the proof but as Danny was such a big part of my life at one time I couldn\u2019t not mention him in my book.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe later added that she \u2018only has nice things to say about him\u2019.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted a rep for Danny for further comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
