Their identity is no longer relevant.", "language": "en", "text": "\u00a9 Alex Brandon/AP President Trump in the Oval Office on Thursday. He has continued to demand that the whistleblower who complained about his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky come forward.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The opinions in this article are the author\u2019s, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft.\n\nOur client\u2019s whistleblower complaint about President Trump\u2019s efforts to solicit interference from Ukraine in the 2020 U.S. election was publicly released a month ago, and since then, speculation about the whistleblower\u2019s identity has only increased. As each allegation in the complaint is substantiated by new witnesses, the president and his supporters remain fanatically devoted to bringing our client into the spotlight. But the reality is that the identity of the whistleblower is irrelevant.\n\nIn August, our client lawfully filed a detailed complaint that prompted the intelligence community inspector general to conduct a preliminary investigation. That inquiry, which involved multiple witnesses \u2014 all of whom are also lawfully protected as whistleblowers \u2014 led to a finding that the complaint was both \u201curgent\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d and was legally required to be transmitted to Congress.\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\nOver the past month, we have all learned more facts \u2014 from the White House\u2019s summarized transcript of the July call with Ukraine\u2019s president, from text messages provided to the House of Representatives by the former U.S. special representative for Ukraine, and from congressional testimony by people intimately involved with the circumstances the whistleblower first raised concern about. Much of what has been disclosed since the release of our client\u2019s complaint actually exceeds the whistleblower\u2019s knowledge of what transpired at the time the complaint was submitted. Because our client has no additional information about the president\u2019s call, there is no justification for exposing their identity and all the risks that would follow.\n\nHowever, even as the emerging facts have substantiated our client\u2019s complaint, the president continues to repeatedly ask, \u201cWhere\u2019s the whistleblower?\u201d (He did this as recently as Thursday night.) He has even described our client as a \u201cso-called whistleblower\u201d and suggested that the whistleblower is passing on information from Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Perhaps most concerning is that the president has equated whistleblowers with \u201cspies,\u201d even stating: \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d In the \u201cold days,\u201d spies were executed. It is clear to all what the president was suggesting.\n\nNow Republican leaders in Congress are also focusing their attention on attacking the messenger and demanding public testimony from the whistleblower. This is nothing more than a diversionary tactic. For the record, we have notified both the House and Senate intelligence committees in a bipartisan manner that the whistleblower is willing to respond to any questions in writing and under oath.\n\nIt is outrageous for the president to claim that our client engaged in treason. Nor did our client spy on the president. The whistleblower was the sole drafter of the complaint and followed the letter of the law. As a federal official, our client swore an oath to uphold the Constitution and therefore had a duty to report these serious allegations of government misconduct. Acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire \u2014 himself an appointee of the president \u2014 stated in his public testimony Sept. 26 that our client \u201cacted in good faith\u201d and did \u201ceverything by the book.\u201d We agree entirely.\n\nWe have each handled politically charged, precedent-setting whistleblower cases in the recent past. When Mark Zaid represented the CIA whistleblowers at the heart of the Republican-led Benghazi investigation, that matter was also political and hyper-partisan in nature. But in that case, no one threatened \u2014 let alone attempted \u2014 to expose those whistleblowers as a form of retribution. The focus was getting to the truth of what happened, as difficult as that truth may have been for some to accept. Andrew Bakaj crafted the legal and investigative framework protecting intelligence community whistleblowers, and himself reluctantly became a CIA whistleblower. We intimately understand the professional risk of having identities exposed, and the need to protect the individual whistleblower and the process as a whole.\n\nThe reckless attacks on our client are particularly disturbing because they undermine an already frail system meant to protect honorable whistleblowers who lawfully disclose a reasonable belief that there has been a violation of law, rule or regulation, or an abuse of authority. Exposing the identity of the whistleblower and attacking our client would do nothing to undercut the validity of the complaint\u2019s allegations. What it would do, however, is put that individual and their family at risk of harm. Perhaps more important, it would deter future whistleblowers from coming forward in subsequent administrations, Democratic or Republican. And if the lawful whistleblower system fails, that would encourage other individuals to illegally leak classified information to journalists to hide their identities and guard themselves from political attacks.\n\nMembers of Congress, in particular \u2014 even those who might oppose impeachment \u2014 have a responsibility to the American public to address the substantive facts instead of engaging in a spiteful campaign to expose the identity of someone who used a lawful process put in place by Congress itself to enable oversight of the executive branch.\n\nTwitter: @AndrewBakaj\n\n@MarkZaid", "description": "The public now knows more about the call with Ukraine than what was in the complaint.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAJmyvu.img?h=201&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=2056&y=1338", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
