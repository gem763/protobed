Cabinet ministers are informed by conference call Protests and protestations Tens of thousands protest against prorogation. Cross-party group of MPs steps up preparation for blocking no deal when parliament makes a brief return Parliament returns Parliament returns and the prime minister loses six votes in six days. MPs vote to prevent a no-deal Brexit, and refuse Johnson's attempts to force them into a general election. Gina Miller case fails Legal campaigner Gina Miller vows to continue her \u201cfight for democracy\u201d after the high court dismissed her claim that the prime minister acted unlawfully in giving advice to the Queen to suspend parliament at a time of momentous political upheaval. Parliament dissolved Parliament is dissolved amid chaotic scenes as some MPs hold up signs saying they have been silenced, try to prevent Speaker John Bercow leaving the chamber, and sing the Red Flag. Scottish court ruling The court of session in Scotland rules that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks was unlawful. The case will go to the supreme court. Supreme court hearing The Supreme court begins three-day hearing to join together all the appeals and legal challenges to the prorogation. Supreme court finds prorogation was unlawful The judges unanimously decided that prorogation was justiciable, and it was in the power of the court to rule on it. They additionally found that the prorogation was unlawful, as it had the effect of preventing parliament from being able to carry out its constitutional functions. The court found that the prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen was unlawful, void and of no effect. Their unanimous judgement was that parliament had not been prorogued. Parliament goes back to work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true, but even if it were true the use of language of that sort is completely disproportionate, completely over the top, and feeds into this narrative that anyone who doesn\u2019t agree with No 10\u2019s position is somehow unpatriotic or betraying the country, or an enemy, or wanting the country to surrender.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI am worried about the use of language at the moment. It is incredibly divisive, it is designed to stoke resentment, provoke anger, to nurse grievances, and it is feeding into a toxic atmosphere, not just in parliament but I think more widely.\u201d\n\nGauke, who has said he would like to return as a Conservative MP, also accused Johnson of acting like Trump.\n\n\u201cI think the Conservative party should aim higher than the standards of Donald Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nPlay Video 1:04 'I've been a model of restraint': Boris Johnson defends his language on Brexit \u2013 video\n\nWriting in the Guardian that Johnson needed to produce his Brexit plan, the former cabinet minister Justine Greening also raised concerns over the tone of his language. She wrote: \u201cBoris Johnson is in charge. Failure will be at his door, no one else\u2019s. Offensive and incendiary language intended to distract parliament and Britain won\u2019t distract from the reality that he and his government have produced no detailed plan whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThe former home secretary Amber Rudd said Johnson\u2019s words had been contributing to a \u201cmore aggressive approach\u201d and accused him of using language that could incite violence. She also said No 10 appeared to be trying to \u201cmobilise anger\u201d.\n\nJohnson\u2019s use of the phrase \u201csurrender act\u201d to refer to the Benn Act has been repeatedly criticised by Labour MPs, who said they were receiving more death threats and referenced the murder of Jo Cox by a rightwing extremist. The prime minister provoked outrage by saying this was \u201chumbug\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on the Andrew Marr Show, Johnson has claimed he was just talking about criticism of the term \u201csurrender act\u201d and doubled down on its usage, arguing the language was proportionate.\n\nApart from Gauke, few of the 21 MPs who had the whip removed were present at the Conservative conference, which has a slogan of \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d. Rory Stewart, the former leadership candidate, cancelled an event and suggested he could start his own En Marche! style political movement.\n\nIt was left to Eurosceptic hardliners in the cabinet to dominate the main conference stage. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, accused MPs of holding the public \u201cin contempt\u201d and also described the Brexit party leader as in \u201cmany ways quite admirable\u201d.\n\nDominic Raab, the foreign secretary, also warned his former Tory colleagues that \u201chistory would never forgive you\u201d if they voted to put Jeremy Corbyn even temporarily in Downing Street by backing a no-confidence motion in the prime minister. He told the conference floor: \u201cThere are some things even bigger than Brexit, and keeping that lot out of Downing Street is one of them.\u201d\n\nLater, Morgan, who defended the use of the term \u201csurrender act\u201d, addressed a One Nation rally on Sunday night, urging moderates to stay in the party \u201cand don\u2019t go anywhere over the next few weeks, months, years and beyond\u201d.", "description": "Former minister David Gauke says No 10 should not ape Donald Trump\u2019s tactics and language", "authors": ["Rowena Mason", "Peter Walker", "Kim Leadbeater", "Catherine Anderson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41146a5a43722d792c4424a9a0e30c3961c5865c/401_68_3330_1997/master/3330.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3ac49872cdb04d4f2bb8137835f7b5fd", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
