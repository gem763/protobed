Her adopted mother had died in 2015 and her adopted father passed in 1994, leaving her without any immediate family to tell her anything they knew. And because she was privately adopted, she could not get information from the state.\n\nAbout a month after first taking the test, she heard from 23andMe and learned that she had a first cousin on her mother\u2019s side.\n\nThe two got in touch and Shepherd soon learned that her first cousin's aunt was Shepherd\u2019s birth mother. Shepherd knew that her birth mother had gone to Vallejo to have the baby and the baby\u2019s father was in the military. Her cousin confirmed to her that was the story he also knew of his aunt.\n\nShepherd\u2019s mom died 16 years earlier, but she was told that towards the end of her mother\u2019s life she tried to find Shepherd.\n\n\"She just wanted to tell me that she loved me,\" Shepherd said.\n\nIn February of this year, Shepherd got another message from the genealogy company, notifying her that there was another relative.\n\nThis time, it was on her dad\u2019s side.\n\nCourtesy Christine Shepherd\n\nThe cousin who she was matched with on her dad\u2019s side put her in contact with her three sisters, and they quickly hit it off.\n\n\"Everyone has been so welcoming, so loving. That has been something I truly didn\u2019t expect,\" she said.\n\nShe met two of her younger sisters, 53-year-old Kimberly and 50-year-old Cheryl, in her California home and the three spent hours going through old photos and learning about one another.\n\n\"We just literally hung out and talked because it was such an easy, seamless situation,\" Shepherd said. \"It was just like three sisters hanging out.\"\n\nShe\u2019s looking forward to meeting her youngest sister, 40-year-old Autumn, when she visits her father, Kendell Fors.\n\nIt will also be the first time she celebrates her birthday with her birth family.\n\n\"There\u2019s a party and everyone\u2019s going to meet me,\" she said. \"They have family and friends and their church, so apparently it\u2019s a big to do.\"", "description": "Christine Shepherd took a DNA test to learn more about her family's health history, but came away with finding her whole family.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/christine-1-ht-er-190917_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
