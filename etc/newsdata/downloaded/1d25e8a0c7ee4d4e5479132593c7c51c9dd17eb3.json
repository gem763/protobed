Here are the most critical in the coming weeks:\n\nThe 30-day challenge \u2013 20 September\n\nDuring one of Johnson\u2019s first foreign visits, Angela Merkel suggested a solution to the Brexit impasse \u201cin the next 30 days\u201d. The prime minister immediately took the remark as a challenge, responding: \u201cYou have set a very blistering timetable of 30 days \u2013 if I understood you correctly, I am more than happy with that.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHowever, though Johnson bound himself to the deadline, the German chancellor later issued a clarification. \u201cI did not set a 30-day deadline,\u201d she said. \u201cI said that what one can achieve in three or two years can also be achieved in 30 days. It\u2019s not about 30 days.\u201d\n\nIn any case, the non-deadline falls today, and the negotiations remain at an impasse. Moving on.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It is the last planned meeting of the EU 27 ahead of the Brexit deadline of Halloween.\n\nJohnson claims to be \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the prospect, despite not yet providing any formal proposals in writing.\n\nMPs\u2019 red line \u2013 19 October\n\nThis is the deadline that really matters. The anti-no-deal Brexit alliance at Westminster secured this win before the prime minister prorogued parliament for five weeks.\n\nIf no Brexit deal has been agreed by this deadline, then the prime minister will be forced by law \u2013 the Brexit Extension Act \u2013 to seek an extension to the negotiations. He has previously ruled out doing so, and writing the extension letter could be fatal to his premiership.\n\nIf an extension is requested, it is also likely to result in a general election as the opposition parties have said they will support a public vote under these circumstances.\n\n31 October \u2013 Halloween Brexit deadline\n\nThis is the Brexit deadline extension secured by Theresa May before she resigned as prime minister, and one that has come to define Johnson\u2019s premiership so far. Since running for the leadership, the Tory leader has pledged to the British people to sever the UK\u2019s ties with the EU by the 31 October deadline.\n\nIf Johnson does defy expectations in the coming weeks, and secures a deal with the EU that the House of Commons finds acceptable, this is the date the UK will leave the bloc. But that appears highly unlikely.\n\nUnless the prime minister ignores the law, the Benn Act (mentioned previously) will have prevented Johnson from crashing out of the bloc on 31 October without a deal in place.", "description": "Throughout the Brexit negotiations, \u201cthe clock is ticking\u201d has been a phrase employed by EU officials countless times \u2013 most recently by Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister on Monday as he pointed to the empty podium where Boris Johnson was supposed to be standing.\u00a0But there have also been various \u201cdeadlines\u201d floating around.
