She said the decision seemed arbitrary and faulted officials for failing to carry out a formal notice-and-comment practice required for major changes to federal rules.\n\n\u201cGovernment actors who make policy decisions in their official capacities cannot succumb to whims or passions while rulemaking,\u201d wrote Jackson, an appointee of President Barack Obama. \u201cIf a policy decision that an agency makes is of sufficient consequence that it qualifies as an agency rule, then arbitrariness in deciding the contours of that rule\u2014e.g., decision making by Ouija board or dart board, rock/paper/scissors, or even the Magic 8 Ball\u2014simply will not do.\u201d\n\nImmigration officials said the new policy would ease burdens on beleaguered immigration courts and the Justice Department, as well as freeing up bed space in immigration detention centers, but Jackson said she saw no indication that officials considered the potential disruption in the lives of hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants and their families.\n\n\u201cThere is no evident consideration of the considerable downsides of adopting a policy that, in many respects, could significantly impact people\u2019s everyday lives in many substantial, tangible, and foreseeable ways,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cAn agency cannot consider only the perceived shiny bright spots of a policy that it is mulling\u2014the silver lining, if you will.\u201d\n\nMorning Shift Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

She said that undercut the notion that there was no time to conduct a public-comment process.\n\nThe judge also scoffed at Justice Department arguments that the July memo declaring the new policy was of no direct significance because immigration officials would still have to make case-by-case decisions about who to put into the expedited process.\n\n\u201cThe potential benevolence of individual line-agents is cold comfort from the standpoint of those persons who are located far from the border and are now in the agency\u2019s crosshairs, when, prior to the New Designation, they were not,\u201d Jackson wrote.\n\nAnd despite bitter complaints from Trump, Attorney General Bill Barr and other officials about individual federal judges blocking policies nationwide, Jackson did just that and coupled her decision with a withering attack on the administration\u2019s contention.\n\n\u201cIn sum, and sternly put, the argument that an administrative agency should be permitted to side-step the required result of a fair-fought fight about well-established statutory constraints on agency action is a terrible proposal that is patently inconsistent with the dictates of the law,\u201d wrote Jackson.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, it reeks of bad faith, demonstrates contempt for the authority that the Constitution\u2019s Framers have vested in the judicial branch, and, ultimately, deprives successful plaintiffs of the full measure of the remedy to which they are entitled,\u201d she added.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement: \"Once again, a single district judge has suspended application of Federal law nationwide\u2014removing whole classes of illegal aliens from legal accountability.\"\n\nA Justice Dept. spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cCongress expressly authorized the Secretary of Homeland Security to act with dispatch to remove from the country aliens who have no right to be here. The district court\u2019s decision squarely conflicts with that express grant of authority and vastly exceeds the district court\u2019s own authority. This ruling undermines the laws enacted by Congress and the Trump Administration\u2019s careful efforts to implement those laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s decision to stop the expansion of this process will protect hundreds of thousands of longtime U.S. residents from being deported without a court hearing and prevents the country from becoming a \u2018show me your papers\u2019 regime,\u201d said Trina Realmuto of the American Immigration Council.\n\nJackson\u2019s ruling came on a lawsuit filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Immigration Council on behalf of immigrant rights groups Make the Road New York, LUPE, and WeCount.\n\nTed Hesson contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/95/7e/3c1a69f24924ac075d07aed7c228/19928-border-wall-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
