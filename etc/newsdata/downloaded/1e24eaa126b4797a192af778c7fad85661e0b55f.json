The arrest stems from incidents between 2002 and 2005.\n\n\u201cI rang the doorbell of this incredible mansion, and a butler answered the door,\u201d said Tai, who hails from Padova, a small town near Venice. \u201cIt was astonishing. It was a very beautiful house, and I saw about five models walking around as soon as I walked in. I was so excited.\u201d\n\nTai said she was greeted by a woman with \u201cshort black hair\u201d who showed her into Epstein\u2019s office. She doesn\u2019t remember the woman\u2019s name, although when The Post showed her a photograph of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s gal pal, she confirmed that she looked like the same woman who met her at Epstein\u2019s mansion.\n\nThe British socialite, a daughter of media mogul Robert Maxwell, has not been charged with a crime but has been accused by three women in court papers of recruiting young women for Epstein. Two of them alleged that both Maxwell and Epstein sexually assaulted them.\n\nEpstein, a financier, was close friends with Ohio billionaire Leslie Wexner, who owned Limited Brands \u2014 now L Brands \u2014 the parent company of Victoria\u2019s Secret. Wexner was so close to Epstein that both men shared ownership of the sprawling East 71st Street mansion where Tai went for the meeting. The deed was transferred in 2011 to Epstein\u2019s Virgin Islands LLC.\n\nThe woman with the short hair introduced Tai to Epstein, who was dressed casually in a shirt and jeans, she said. As Epstein started to ask her questions about her background, she noticed a massage table near his desk.\n\nShe said she didn\u2019t think anything of it, and reached for her portfolio to show Epstein her previous modeling work in Italy. Tai had done a few modeling jobs in her native country, \u201cbut nothing big, nothing like I imagined I could do in America,\u201d she told The Post.\n\nAs Tai talked about her experience in halting English, she said Epstein moved to the massage table and began to remove his clothes.\n\n\u201cI thought he was preparing to have a massage, and that someone was about to come in to the room and give him a massage,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Tai said she panicked when Epstein lay down naked on the table and told her to approach.\n\nHe then handed her a vibrator, she said.\n\n\u201cI froze,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\u201cI just grabbed the vibrator and threw it at his head,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know where it landed, I just blacked out and then I ran as fast as I could out of the room.\u201d\n\nShe was so frightened, she didn\u2019t know where to turn to find the front door in the massive house. At one point, she said, she encountered the woman with the short black hair, who grabbed her and asked her what she was doing.\n\n\u201cShe told me that I couldn\u2019t just leave,\u201d said Tai. \u201cShe said that this man is important, that he is a friend of President Clinton.\u201d\n\nTai never told her booker what had happened at Epstein\u2019s mansion.\n\n\u201cI was too scared to tell anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cI was too shy and scared that someone would come after me to blackmail me or maybe worse.\u201d\n\nEpstein, who was an investor in a Manhattan modeling venture, has been accused by prosecutors of using his connections to the modeling company to \u201caudition\u201d girls to give him massages that often ended up in sexual abuse.\n\n\u201cOver the years, it seems Epstein relied on \u2026 [the] modeling business to source underage girls for sex,\u201d writes Conchita Sarnoff, an investigative reporter, in her book \u201cTrafficking.\u201d\n\nA former Manhattan-based model agent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also alleged an Epstein-Victoria\u2019s Secret pimp pipeline.\n\n\u201cHe [Epstein] portrayed himself as the back door to get a girl into Victoria\u2019s Secret. Some of those girls got in,\u201d he said.\n\nHe promised the catalog and ad-campaign jobs, not the supermodel fashion-show gigs, he added.\n\n\u201cIt was still significant cash for a young model doing the catalog,\u201d said the agent. \u201cThey weren\u2019t making hundreds of thousands but they could make about $5,000 a week modeling for the campaigns or the catalog. Not all the girls sent to him got jobs, but a lot of them did.\u201d\n\nAnother Manhattan model entrepreneur told The Post that Maxwell was a constant fixture at Victoria\u2019s Secret events.\n\n\u201cThey were always these really trashy shows full of rich men in the audience,\u201d he said. \u201cGhislaine acted as the kind of Nazi guard, telling everyone where they were sitting in the audience and that she had new \u2018pop tarts,\u2019 which is what she called the young models.\u201d\n\nEpstein\u2019s lawyer, L Brands and Maxwell\u2019s attorney did not return messages seeking comment.\n\nTai said she was so frightened that she returned to Italy, although she did continue to take on a handful of modeling jobs. She said she never went to the police because she feared reprisals and worried that filing a report would ruin her fledgling career.\n\nTai told The Post she wanted to tell her story now because of the recent reports of Epstein\u2019s abuse of girls.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s terrible,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s awful what he did to me, and what he did to those girls. It\u2019s just not right, especially in a young girl.\u201d\n\nHer own run-in had severe consequences.\n\n\u201cIt changed me for life,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I lived in a hateful world. It was shocking to realize that if I wanted to be a model in America, I was expected to work as a prostitute.\u201d\n\nRelated Video Video length 1 minute 16 seconds 1:16 Jeffrey Epstein accusers' attorney supports no bail Jeffrey Epstein accusers' attorney supports no bail", "description": "Jeffery Epstein, a convicted pedophile who was arrested for sexually abusing \u201cdozens\u201d of minor girls was constant fixture at Victoria's Secret events.", "authors": ["July"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/elisabetta-tai.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-07-14"}
