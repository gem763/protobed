Again.\n\nThis time \u2014 the 18th cancellation of the year \u2014 the official explanation was \u201cequipment availability resulting from a mechanical issue.\u201d But these aggrieved riders in Middletown did not seem to care. They had heard all the excuses the railroad had to offer. All that really mattered was that they were not getting to work on time. Again.\n\nThis is the plight of the hundreds of people who depend on what just may be the worst commuter train in America. The railroad they ride, New Jersey Transit, has been plagued for the last two years by a rash of cancellations.\n\nWhile a few other trains New Jersey Transit operates were canceled more often during the first six months of the year, they were either evening trains or morning trains on busier lines. Those riders had better alternatives.\n\nThe regulars on the 2606 had no such luck.\n\nThe next train making the same trip would reach Hoboken Terminal almost an hour later, an eternity in the grinding, daily race to work. By then, it would be 9:17 a.m., at best, and all hope of making the morning meeting or being ready when the financial markets opened would be lost.\n\nInstead, many of them would catch the first train that came and transfer somewhere \u2014 maybe in two places \u2014 to get close to their destinations as early as possible.\n\nNick Giovine knows that drill. He lives in Middletown and dreams of being a regular on the 2606 to get to his job. But he lost faith many months ago.\n\nAfter New Jersey Transit started canceling trains with frustrating frequency last year, Giovine persuaded his boss to let him skip the commute one day a week \u2014 and quit giving $317 to the railroad 12 times a year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve stopped buying a monthly pass because the service is so unreliable,\u201d Giovine, 31, said. \u201cLuckily, my boss is allowing me to work from home once a week to help with the stress of commuting.\u201d\n\nPassengers wait on the platform as a New Jersey Transit train arrives at Middletown Station in Middletown, N.J., on Sept. 26, 2019. (Bryan Anselm/The New York Times) More\n\nAnother rider from Middletown, Kelly Farmer, said this week that she had abandoned the 2606 for a later train, in part because it had been so unreliable. Her new train, which leaves an hour later, has \u201cdefinitely been more reliable,\u201d Farmer said. \u201cThough, I hope I didn\u2019t just jinx it.\u201d\n\nReliability is supposed to be the hallmark of commuter railroads. They may not offer the comforts of an Amtrak cross-country excursion, but they are expected to perform the prosaic duty of transporting people to work and home again.\n\nFor a couple years now, New Jersey Transit has consistently failed in that mission. It has been plagued by cancellations and suspensions of service, most of which its executives blamed on a rush to install safety equipment and a shortage of engineers to drive trains.\n\nGov. Philip D. Murphy has promised to fix the railroad since before he was elected in 2017. But in the first six months of 2019, New Jersey Transit canceled more than 1,300 trains \u2014 more than 50 a week \u2014 according to a New York Times analysis of the agency\u2019s reports on social media.\n\nThe disruption has been spread across the railroad\u2019s 12 lines, but it has not been spread evenly. The Times\u2019 analysis found that six different trains were canceled at least 15 times from January through June.", "description": "MIDDLETOWN, N.J. -- It was only 7 a.m., but for the commuters stewing inside a Spartan train station in this bedroom community, the day was already off to a predictably bad start.Their train, North Jersey Coast Line 2606, which is supposed to depart at 7:06 a.m., had been canceled.
