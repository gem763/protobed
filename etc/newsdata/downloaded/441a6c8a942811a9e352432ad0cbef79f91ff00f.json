This is the 2020 Mazda MX-30, an EV crossover with suicide doors reminiscent of those on the old RX-8.\n\nLike a lot of new high-riding cars, the 2020 Mazda MX-30 sports a coupe-esque design, with a dramatically sloped C-pillar. The B-pillar is integrated into the rear door, allowing for easy access to the back seats and a cool pillarless look when the both doors are open. Combined with a slim front grille that integrates into the headlights, the MX-30 has a handsome, neat look.\n\nThe interior is much of the same story, with a sleek dashboard incorporating cork, and fabrics made from recycled material.\n\nMazda didn't reveal much about the car's electric powertrain, saying only that it's packing a 33.5-kWh lithium-ion battery pack in the floor. No power or range figures have been given. Though the automaker didn't mention it in the initial press release, the MX-30 may eventually receive a rotary range extender, something Mazda confirmed last year.\n\nPre-orders for European customers are already open, with deliveries starting in 2020. Car and Driver predicts the MX-30 will come to America at some point as well.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "This crossover is Mazda's first electric car.
