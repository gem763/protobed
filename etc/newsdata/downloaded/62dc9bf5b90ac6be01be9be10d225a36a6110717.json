REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo\n\nA fund manager in Germany can buy 10-year U.S. Treasuries that offer minimal credit risk at yields of up to 1.6%, more than 2 percentage points more than for German Bunds.\n\nBut that juicier yield is available only if she eschews expensive currency hedging that could wipe out that whole premium \u2014 a vulnerable position that funds have traditionally avoided for fear of adverse exchange rate swings.\n\nHedging dollar exposure is expensive \u2014 at current prices, the German investor\u2019s 2.2% yield pick up on 10-year Treasuries would become a 0.3% loss after hedging.\n\nWith some 40% of non-U.S. debt \u2014 about $15 trillion \u2014 now yielding less than zero, however, it\u2019s a risk that funds \u2014especially those with obligations to insurance policyholders and pensioners \u2014 seem prepared to take.\n\n\u201cFor fixed income investors, the normal habit is to hedge currency risk, but this year we\u2019ve seen a tendency to hedge less,\u201d said Claire Dissaux, head of global strategy at fund Millennium Global, which helps clients manage FX exposures.\n\n\u201cIf you are a euro zone investor, it\u2019s expensive to hedge (dollar exposure) so there has been a temptation to not hedge. And if you didn\u2019t hedge you will have done well.\u201d\n\n(GRAPHIC: Sovereign bond yield heatmap - here)\n\nHedges are usually implemented via currency forwards that specify the rate at which a currency may be exchanged over the contract period \u2014 usually three or six months. That effectively shields the fund if the foreign currency depreciates against its base currency.\n\nFunds rarely disclose their hedging strategies but interviews with money managers and advisors, data on hedged and unhedged bond returns, and exchange rate moves imply the ratio of unhedged debt holdings in portfolios has been rising.\n\nA survey of corporate clients by U.S. bank Wells Fargo showed 35% of FX exposure was hedged in 2018, versus 47% in 2016, indicating a broader decline in hedging appetite.\n\nJapan\u2019s $1.5 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) recently decided to reclassify FX-hedged foreign debt as domestic, giving itself leeway to buy more foreign debt \u2014 including \u201cscope to increase buying of FX-unhedged foreign bonds\u201d, Barclays analysts wrote.\n\nA yen-based investor currently earns a 196 bp yield pickup on 10-year Treasuries \u2014 but a 0.5% loss after hedging costs.\n\nFor an interactive version of the below graphic, click here tmsnrt.rs/31u7eRl.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Losing appeal - here)\n\nJapanese funds bought 2.57 trillion yen ($23.76 billion) of U.S. bonds in July, official data shows, the most in a month since July 2016.\n\nWith little reliable data, investors often use exchange rate moves to draw conclusions on hedge ratios. Because hedging effectively offsets the purchase of an FX asset by selling the same currency in forward markets, a currency may strengthen more if it is not being sold for hedging purposes.\n\nDissaux said the U.S. dollar\u2019s resilience in the face of interest rate cuts and slowing growth is partly due to investors not hedging their dollar exposure.\n\nTohru Sasaki, head of Japan rates and FX research at JPMorgan, says the dollar-yen exchange rate has a fairly stable correlation to the yield gap between 10-year Treasuries and Japanese government bonds.\n\n\u201cBut in September the dollar has shifted about one yen above the usual correlation and it rose further in the last couple of weeks, which suggests unusual factors are driving up dollar/yen,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cUnhedged foreign bond buying by Japanese investors is the most likely culprit.\u201d\n\nFor an interactive version of the below graphic, click here tmsnrt.rs/2ZZ4b6p.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Going West - here)\n\nTRIMMING HEDGES?\n\nThe shift is important because bond investors are a risk-averse bunch. Pension and insurance funds desire slim but steady returns \u2014 and holding bonds unhedged can jeopardize that.\n\nWhen U.S. bonds yielded around 5% and the Treasury yield curve was steep, hedging costs ate less into returns.\n\nBut a flattening of the curve since 2016, so that long-maturity debt yields barely more than short-dated bonds, has crushed post-hedging yields, said Ugo Lancioni, managing director for global fixed income at Neuberger Berman.\n\nFor an interactive graphic, please see tmsnrt.rs/2OE7XvX\n\n(GRAPHIC: BUY AMERICAN - here)\n\n\u201c(Curve flattening) has forced Japanese and other investors to buy bonds on an increasingly unhedged basis ... if you were to hedge your FX risk completely, what you earn on the long end you can lose by hedging on the short end,\u201d Lancioni said.\n\nAlthough it is unusual for hedging costs to eliminate the yield advantage of a foreign security, the gap between U.S. interest rates and those in Europe and Japan \u2014 on which the cost of forwards is based \u2014 mean no change is likely soon.\n\nCollapsing currency volatility is another factor. With big FX swings now relatively rare, it\u2019s become less risky for bond investors to run unhedged portfolios.\n\n\u201cThe Fed has not pushed the button (on U.S. interest rates) and said we\u2019re going to zero, like in Europe and Japan. So if you\u2019re looking to take on dollar exposure, it\u2019s probably still to your advantage to enjoy the full interest rate differential,\u201d said Tim Horan, chief investment officer for fixed income at Chilton Trust in New York.\n\nSome would call the strategy reckless. Dollar positioning, valuations and the low-volatility backdrop have reached extremes, meaning any reversal could be bloody. The dollar meanwhile faces headwinds from Fed rate cuts and President Donald Trump, who blames currency strength for U.S. trade woes.\n\nFILE PHOTO: An employee of a foreign currency company walks past in front of a graph showing recent movements of the exchange rates between the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar at a dealing room in Tokyo, Japan, August 6, 2019.

You may lose the integrity of a fixed income portfolio,\u201d said Ben Popatlal, multi-asset strategist at Schroders.\n\nDo clients usually know what currency risks they face? Popatlal said active managers tend to have discretion over portfolios, with clients kept informed of strategy shifts.\n\n\u201cOur neutral starting point is to be 100% hedged and then take active decisions away from that, such that every currency earns its place in the portfolio,\u201d he added.", "description": "Some European and Japanese bond investors are taking on more currency risk by buying dollar debt without protecting themselves against potentially devastating exchange rate swings as they seek ways to compensate for sub-zero yields at home.", "authors": ["Saikat Chatterjee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439571189&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0DJ", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
