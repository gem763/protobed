Based only on the facts, you could easily make the inference that Jones is a tremendous grinning dipshit who has gone mad with power after what feels like centuries of being paid comically large briefcases full of cash to yell into a microphone about whichever minority group is pissing him off on any given day.\n\nWhat else can you say about a man who was found by Australia\u2019s media watchdog to have used his position to incite racial violence? A lot, actually \u2014 but none of it will capture the essence of just how much he (again) really just fucking sucks. Would calling him a \u2018git\u2019 do it? No, no it would not. A git is someone who almost runs you over when you\u2019re crossing the road because they didn\u2019t indicate. Jones is well beyond that. But apparently calling Jones a git is enough to get News Corp in a tizzy \u2014 even if you did it 7 years ago.\n\nRemember 2012? Things were different back then. The first Avengers movie was released in cinemas, Jacinda Ardern was an Opposition spokesperson for social development, and Jones was busy suggesting that Julia Gillard\u2019s father, who passed away weeks earlier after a protracted illness, actually died of shame because he \u201chad a daughter who told lies every time she stood for parliament\u201d.\n\nArdern, still a while away from becoming the Prime Minister of New Zealand at the time, tweeted this in response:\n\nI know an Alan Jones. Unlike the Aussie version, he isn't a git or intensely disliked by the general population. \u2014 Jacinda Ardern (@jacindaardern) September 30, 2012\n\nThis incredibly mild criticism didn\u2019t cause much of a fuss until just over 7 years later, when Sky News dug it up in an \u2018exclusive\u2019 story this morning:\n\nSky News has unearthed a personal attack \u2013 launched by @jacindaardern \u2013 against @AlanJones in a 2012 tweet where she referred to the broadcaster as a \"git\" and claimed he was \"intensely disliked\".https://t.co/rOMZG3fleW \u2014 Sky News Australia (@SkyNewsAust) October 22, 2019\n\nSky\u2019s dramatic \u2018launched a personal attack\u2019 phrasing might be somewhat more suited to comments Jones made about Ardern back in August of this year, in which he called her a \u201cclown\u201d and an \u201cutter lightweight\u201d and implored Scott Morrison to \u201cshove a sock down her throat\u201d. What a chill guy.\n\nAsked about it today, Ardern did not have much to say. \u201cThis is a reference to a tweet from seven years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cOf late you\u2019ve seen I\u2019ve not been offering up thoughts or opinions on the issue of Alan Jones. I don\u2019t intend to now.\u201d", "description": "Sky News Australia has made a bizarre attempt to drum up controversy about a very mildly insulting tweet Jacinda Ardern made about Alan Jones 7 years ago.", "authors": ["Ben Mcleay"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-474378656-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
