Before it\u2019s even Halloween! -- of the festive season. An apocalyptic rain has descended on us. It\u2019s getting darker in the evenings and the temperature has dropped to \u2018you at least need a light coat\u2019 weather. It is less than three months until Christmas.\n\nOf course, the dread around the festive season is something you develop against your will in adulthood, like council tax bills and worrying about your Uber rating. When you were a kid it was fun, and that was primarily thanks to the invention of the humble advent calendar. The dizzying excitement of rushing to the little cardboard box every morning to eat soapy chocolate for breakfast. The illicit thrill of opening box 15 when it was only the 12th of December and hoping your mum wouldn\u2019t go mad. One of the saddest parts of growing up is losing that thrill, which perhaps explains in part the huge explosion in the popularity of beauty advent calendars over the past few years.\n\nFor as cheap as 20 quid or -- if you\u2019re feeling flush -- several hundred more, you can recreate that childhood excitement, replacing the soapy chocolates you once loved with tiny versions of all your favourite beauty products instead. It\u2019s a big and lucrative business. Beauty calendars, supposedly festive-themed, now go on sale as early as August. Selfridges and Boots sell several different brand offerings, while others, like those from Liberty and Cult Beauty, sell out so quickly that for the honour of owning one, you\u2019ll have to get yourself on a months-long waiting list. Since launching their advent calendar five years ago Jo Malone has increased production from a few hundred to 10,000.\n\n\u201cBeauty advent calendars are good for getting a lot of products at a discounted price,\u201d says Nicole, creator of Vegan Beauty Girl. \u201cWhilst they can be fun and help you discover new products, you\u2019ll often find yourself stuck with a lot of beauty products that you don\u2019t want or need. They are often bought as gifts \u2014 a nice gesture \u2014 but are left unappreciated once the novelty of having something new wears off. If this doesn\u2019t happen day by day, it\u2019ll happen by Christmas. I don\u2019t believe beauty advents are sustainable, they\u2019re a product of over-indulgence which inevitably leads to unnecessary waste.\u201d\n\nAnd the beauty advent calendar boom is growing. Last year Space NK, Debenhams, Fortnum and Mason, and Net-A-Porter all launched their own versions, with Lush joining the fray in 2019. But for beauty fanatics, the environmental impact of their favourite festive purchases could be a little harder to swallow. Many of the leading brands currently selling beauty advent calendars manufacture them in factories based in China or overseas, which means that, even in the cases where they\u2019re packaged in the UK, there\u2019s a lack of transparency over manufacturing practices. Additionally, while many brands told i-D that their advent calendars were recyclable or partly recyclable, not all the elements could be reused. The downside, then, is a huge proliferation of sample-sized, single-use plastic products.\n\nThe worrying aspect of this, though, is that the calendars themselves are sold to us through the rose-tinted glasses of sustainability. Birchbox, for instance, advertises their calendar as recyclable because the structure of the calendar itself, and the paper that sits inside, is. \u201cWe knew we wanted the advent calendar to be recyclable, so we made sure that we had less than the threshold of foiling that made it ok to recycle. This is something we make sure we do with our monthly subscription boxes too,\u201d Birchbox told i-D. But when asked about the products themselves, of which only a selection are full-sized, a representative from the brand explained that not all were recyclable, and that the calendar was produced by a supplier in China.\n\nThere\u2019s also the matter that the point of the advent calendar is by its very design meant to encourage further consumption and spending. Samples lead to sales. In 2018, Liberty\u2019s beauty buyer told Vogue Business that after including a certain fragrance in their advent calendar the previous year, they saw sales figures increase by a massive 90%. But that mentality feels increasingly at odds in a beauty landscape that\u2019s encouraging us to consume less and consume more consciously.\n\nOf course, not every brand has the same practices, and -- rejoice! -- there is a way to consume responsibly if you absolutely must have your beauty advent fix. For Liberty, who sold almost half their stock of advent calendars last year online before the doors had even opened at 8.30am, 19 of their 25 days of goodies are full-sized. That goes some way in explaining both the huge popularity of the calendar, the fastest-selling product Liberty has ever made, and the high price point (it will set you back a cool \u00a3215).\n\nThis year, the calendar is, the brand explains, completely recyclable, and they\u2019ve also launched a \u201cConscious Beauty\u201d campaign, which includes a partnership with Teracycle allowing customers to bring their empties to store to be recycled, rather than going to landfill. \u201cWe have [...] developed a completely recyclable calendar that is both premium product and that is also socially responsible,\u201d said a representative for the brand, who told i-D that while the calendar is manufactured in China, it was with an emphasis on making sure it could be recycled.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s very little regulation of what \u2018sustainable\u2019 means in the beauty industry,\u201d Nicole says. \u201cOften a consumer will think they\u2019re buying something that is kinder to the environment than it really is. Partly-recyclable is always confusing and frustrating for consumers who often give-up and throw all the packaging in the bin. When shopping for gifts this Christmas, try to avoid cardboard gift sets with a glossy cardboard finish or plastic \u2018peep through\u2019 windows as these are more difficult to recycle.\u201d\n\nHolland and Barrett also emphasise their commitment to \u201cclean and conscious beauty\u201d this festive season, with a 2019 \u201cClean Beauty\u201d advent calendar. What this means is that all their products are free of parabens, SLS, microplastics and are made with palm oil that only comes from \u201csustainable, RSPO certified sources\u201d. But dig a little deeper and the same problems persist. \u201cA good selection of the products are in recyclable packaging,\u201d a representative from Holland and Barrett explains, adding that the products are \u201ca mix of full and mini sizes\u201d. And while the calendar itself was packaged within the UK, the supply chain is less clear. \u201cThe calendar was a collaboration with all of our suppliers,\u201d the brand says.\n\nIn fact, if you really want to ensure that your festive beauty is environmentally friendly, your best bet is -- shock -- Lush, famous for its bath bombs and terrifyingly overzealous staff. This year they launched their advent calendar with the interesting step of only producing 500, despite the obvious mass-market appeal. It sold out almost immediately. The Lush calendar, though, (RIP) was a good example of how to do the beauty advent correctly; all the products were full-sized and made in the UK, and all the products either came in recycled packaging or were completely packaging-free. In addition, everything from the chest itself to the ribbon wrapping it up was created in the UK and recyclable (or already recycled itself). This is encouraging, but it seems that the rest of the industry is yet to follow Lush\u2019s lead. And while they can make so much money off importing and mass-marketing mini-products, they might be slow to change.\n\nBut maybe the best thing to do is to save a bit of money, buy the real, full-sized thing and stick to those nostalgic chocolate calendars instead. Vegan chocolate though, obvs, yeah?\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "In the past few years festive calendars selling high-end beauty products have exploded in popularity.
