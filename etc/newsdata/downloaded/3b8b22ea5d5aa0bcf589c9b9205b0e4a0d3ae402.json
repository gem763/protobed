This can often result in pixels interfering with each other and the creation of blurry pictures.\n\nSee also: Galaxy Fold hands-on - I'm almost sold\n\nBut the South Korean tech giant has continued to successfully miniaturise pixels in recent years. The company introduced a 1.0 \u00b5m pixel image sensor in 2015. It then launched image sensors with 0.9\u00b5m and 0.8\u00b5m pixels in 2017 and 2018, respectively.\n\nTraditionally reserved for flagship models, more and more mid-tier smartphones have started to offer double or triple-camera setups, increasing the uptake for image sensors which has been a boon for Samsung's logic chip business.\n\nLike its predecessors, the Isocell Slim GH1 also packs Samsung's Tetracell technology, which makes four pixels act as one to take brighter pictures in dark environments when there isn't enough light.\n\nIt can also take 60 frames per second 4K videos. The sensor will go into mass production sometime this year, Samsung said.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "Samsung continues its efforts in making image sensors smaller with the launch of a 0.7\u00b5m pixel Isocell Slim GH1.", "authors": ["Cho Mu-Hyun"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/18/9710dd9f-0bc2-4c7f-b84b-6cba52fea3c2/thumbnail/770x578/c131b75cca0520f9bb4e9aa678787f6d/samsung-mwc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
