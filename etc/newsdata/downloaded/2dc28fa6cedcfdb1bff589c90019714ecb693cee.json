Dane Coles will start at hooker ahead of Codie Taylor.\n\nCaptain Kieran Read, Ardie Savea and Sam Cane wil again team in the back row, with Savea named on the blindside.\n\nThe midfield and back three selections may have been most problematic for head coach Steven Hansen and his fellow selectors. They have shown immense faith in youngsters Reece and Bridge by leaving Ben Smith among the reserves.\n\n\u201cAny combination of players in our squad could have justified their selection,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cBut in the end we believe the 23 we have selected is the right group for this opposition.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s rugby environment you need to have the mindset that it\u2019s not just about who starts, it\u2019s also about what the players coming off the bench can provide. As an example, we have a great one-two punch with Dane and Codie at hooker and Aaron (Smith) and T.J. (Perenara) at halfback.\u201d\n\nThe match between New Zealand and South Africa will likely decide the winner of their pool. The top-placed team then has a good chance of avoiding a quarterfinal against No. 1-ranked Ireland.\n\n\u201cThe challenge of playing one of our oldest and most respected foes in the opening test has us excited and energized by what lies ahead,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cEach time we play South Africa it\u2019s a tight battle and a real arm wrestle.\n\n\u201cTo perform at our very best we\u2019ll have to play with real clarity, intent, energy and clear heads. Both teams will have their moments and it\u2019ll be our job to ensure we limit theirs and take full opportunity of ours.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand, bidding for a third consecutive World Cup title, was held to a 16-16 draw earlier this season by Rugby Championship winner South Africa.\n\n___\n\nNew Zealand: Beauden Barrett, Sevu Reece, Anton Lienert-Brown, Ryan Crotty, George Bridge, Richie Mo\u2019unga, Aaron Smith; Kieran Read (captain), Sam Cane, Ardie Savea, Scott Barrett, Sam Whitelock, Nepo Laulala, Dane Coles, Joe Moody.
