The meetings touched on confidence-building measures that could include a possible prisoner swap or a reduction in violence, according to the people familiar with the discussions.\n\nPresident Trump last month declared that talks with the Taliban were dead, and abruptly canceled plans to meet Taliban officials at the Camp David presidential retreat to complete an agreement hashed out during a year of bilateral talks, amid opposition from top aides and cabinet members.\n\nAt a rally in Minnesota last week, Mr. Trump appeared to signal openness to return to the table to end the 18-year-old war.\n\n\u201cThe single greatest mistake our country made, in its history, was going into the quicksand,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re pulling people out and we\u2019re trying to make good deals and we\u2019re going to bring our soldiers back home.\u201d\n\nA reduction in violence could be modeled on the cease-fire that took place in June 2018, during the Muslim festival of Eid al-Fitr. The Taliban then announced a three-day cease-fire, leading to extraordinary scenes in which both sides hugged in the streets, ate ice cream and wept.\n\nSince then, the Taliban has refused to agree to any further cease-fires offered by the Afghan government.\n\nAn alternative option, a prisoner swap, could entail the release of Anas Haqqani, a high-ranking member of the Haqqani network, an affiliate of the Taliban, according to the people familiar with the discussions. In exchange, the Taliban would give up two professors, an American and an Australian, who were kidnapped on their way home from teaching at the American University of Afghanistan in 2016, these people said.\n\nMr. Haqqani is the son of the movement\u2019s late founder, Jalaluddin Haqqani, who worked with the Central Intelligence Agency asset in the war against the Soviets. The Haqqani network is now a U.S.-designated terrorist organization.\n\nMr. Haqqani was sentenced to death after the Afghan intelligence agency captured him in 2014, but remains in custody at a maximum-security prison run by the Afghan government. The Taliban\u2019s current second in command, Siraj Haqqani, is his older brother.\n\nThe State Department declined to comment on any aspect of Mr. Khalilzad\u2019s engagement with the Taliban in Pakistan, and wouldn\u2019t confirm whether a meeting took place, but said the trip didn\u2019t represent the start of an Afghan peace process. The Taliban said that no further changes were being made to the previous deal during the talks, and that the group stands ready to sign it.\n\n\u201cThe agreement along with its annexes were finalized after long discussions, now they are ready to be signed,\u201d the spokesman, Suhail Shaheen, said. \u201cNow it is up to the U.S., whether they want the issue resolved through peaceful means or military means.\u201d\n\nThe most recent prisoner swap between the U.S. and the Taliban took place when Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl was exchanged for five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in 2014. Republican lawmakers criticized the Obama administration at the time for failing to notify Congress of the plan. U.S. officials hoped the swap would open the door to a fully-fledged peace process, but it didn\u2019t materialize.\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, left, the top representative for the group in the talks.

The remaining U.S. troops would be pulled out about another year after that. In return, the Taliban would renounce all ties to al Qaeda, a process the U.S. is entitled to verify. There currently are about 14,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.\n\nMr. Khalilzad\u2019s meeting last week with the Taliban\u2019s Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the top representative for the group in the talks, was the first meeting in close to a month since Mr. Trump called off the deal in September. During the hiatus, voters in Afghanistan went to the polls to decide on the country\u2019s future president.\n\nPresident Ashraf Ghani, the incumbent, is seeking a second term. Slightly more than two million Afghans voted in presidential elections last month, a historic low. The election results aren\u2019t expected for weeks.\n\nMr. Ghani\u2019s credentials as a corruption-fighter were dealt a blow last month after the U.S. said it was cutting $60 million in aid due to the Afghan government\u2019s failure to meet transparency and accountability benchmarks. The U.S. also said it was returning $100 million to the U.S. treasury for an energy project because of the Afghan government\u2019s inability to transparently manage resources.\n\nMr. Ghani\u2019s supporters say the government has made significant progress in the fight against corruption during his term.\n\nRick Olson, a former U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said Mr. Trump\u2019s declaration that the talks dead was \u201crhetorical overkill\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe structural conditions\u2014a deteriorating stalemate\u2014have not changed, so both sides need to talk,\u201d Mr. Olson said.\n\nWrite to Jessica Donati at jessica.donati@wsj.com", "description": "U.S. officials and representatives of the Afghan Taliban have begun discussing ways to revive a peace process after talks fell apart last month, according to people familiar with the discussions.", "authors": ["Jessica Donati", "Jessica.Donati Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-116453/social", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
