Andrew Cuomo and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, both Democrats, said during a press conference that they plan to work with counterparts within the northeast corridor to figure out how to go about potentially legalizing pot in the face of federal prohibition.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have, frankly, in my opinion, a federal government that is providing leadership on these issues. We\u2019re getting out of Washington a lot of confusion and a lot of debate, and basically they\u2019re saying to the states, \u2018You are on your own\u2019,\u201d Mr. Cuomo told reporters in West Hartford, Connecticut. \u201cSo If we are on our own, let\u2019s hook our boats together and let\u2019s see if we can find our way through this storm.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we can do that together going forward, I think that would be a priority for both of us,\u201d agreed Mr. Lamont.\n\nThirty-three states and D.C. have passed laws legalizing the medicinal use of marijuana to varying degrees, including New York and Connecticut. Neither are among the 10 states and counting where adults can legally use marijuana for recreational purposes, however, notwithstanding unsuccessful efforts in their legislatures last season to join that list.\n\nLegalizing marijuana \u201ccollective and regionally makes sense,\u201d continued Mr. Cuomo, who said the governors intend to convene a meeting next month with \u201cregional partners and try to talk that through.\u201d\n\nMr. Lamont said the governors planned to work together, \u201cstate by state, and perhaps with our neighboring states in Rhode Island and New Jersey and beyond,\u201d ahead of drafting any proposed regulations for potentially legalizing recreational marijuana.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t agree on everything. We\u2019re not supposed to. We\u2019re supposed to represent the people of our respective states,\u201d said Mr. Cuomo. \u201cBut the conversation is always good. The discussion is always good. And I believe we are going to find many common paths to a better future.\u201d\n\nThe meeting is set for Nov. 5, with Mr. Cuomo hoping to have a legislative proposal ready by the time he delivers his annual state of the state address in early 2020.\n\nSeven of the 10 states with laws in place legalizing recreational marijuana currently allow for adults to purchase pot from regulated dispensaries: Alaska, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington state. Marijuana laws differ state-by-state, however, meaning products sold at licensed dispensaries in Los Angeles, for example, are subject to different rules, regulations and tax rates than to items sold at pot shops in Las Vegas.\n\nDiscussing the patchwork of marijuana laws earlier this week, Mr. Cuomo called them \u201ccounterproductive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said before, people drive across the border, they buy a better product, or they buy a cheaper product, or they buy marijuana with more THC, or they buy marijuana that comes in a different form, and now you have people driving and possibly smoking marijuana at the same time,\u201d he said Tuesday.\n\nRepresentatives for Rhode Island Gov. Gina M. Raimondo and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, both Democrats, did not immediately return messages requesting comment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
