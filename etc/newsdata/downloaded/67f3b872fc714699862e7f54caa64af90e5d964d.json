It is being treated as a double murder investigation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is about a two hour period there that obviously forms part of our inquires trying to work out what happened in that timeslot.\n\n\u201cBut they have definitely changed vehicles and at some stage obviously one met their demise at that location at Tallebudgera Creek Rd and the other person in the motor vehicle.\u201d\n\nDet Supt Johnson also confirmed Mr Martin was found with a puncture wound, which he described as \u201chighly suspicious\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat vehicle hit a tree at a high rate of speed, so he has a number of injuries and trying to sort out what that is,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhether is it a stab wound, gunshot wound, puncture wound, it could be anything. There is a distinctive wound on him and we\u2019ll be making inquiries on that.\u201d\n\nBIKIE\u2019S PLAN TO TURN LIFE AROUND\n\nOne week before a Mr Ross was found dead in Gold Coast bushland he had finalised his court matters in NSW and expressed a desire to spend time with his children.\n\nLawyer Ahmed Dib represented Mr at court in Sydney\u2019s southwest last Monday when he avoided jail for four fraud offences related to luxury cars.\n\nThe vehicles were sourced by a criminal syndicate across NSW and Queensland, which altogether defrauded financial institutions of about $4.5 million.\n\nMr Ross celebrated that night with his wife and Mr Dib before flying home at about midday on Tuesday.\n\nHis body was found at about 1.30pm yesterday.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s tragic news, I\u2019d become close with him,\u201d Mr Dib told news.com.au today.\n\n\u201cHe always talked about taking his family on a holiday, how he wanted to spend more time with his kids growing up and hadn\u2019t recently, and that he\u2019d be allowed to by being on parole.\n\n\u201cHe was going through a number of court matters that he\u2019d finalised. He had nothing left.\u201d\n\nMr Ross\u2019s wife called Mr Dib on Friday to say her husband was missing and they made a joint attempt to contact people, \u201cto see if anybody had heard anything\u201d.\n\nMr Dib received another message from her yesterday after the body was found.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously really disappointing that once he finally had the chance to do it, that opportunity has been taken from him,\u201d he told news.com.au.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going through a really rough period.\u201d\n\nMr Dib said Mr Ross had \u201cabsolutely\u201d been in good spirits and had not expressed any concerns about going back home to Queensland.\n\n\u201cNot at all, he was regularly up and down (to NSW),\u201d he said.\n\nMr Ross\u2019 family and friends had searched desperately for a sign of him across the weekend.\n\nALTERCATION OCCURRED\n\nNine News this morning reported that Mr Ross was found with a gunshot wound to his head.\n\n\u201cObviously some sort of altercation has occurred and as a result, this male person is now deceased,\u201d Acting Superintendent Brendan Smith said.\n\nMr Ross was the founder of MONSTR clothing, and T-shirts have since been left at the scene.\n\nA candle, t shirts and beers laid in tribute for Shane Ross who was found dead in Tallebudgera by a friend yesterday.
