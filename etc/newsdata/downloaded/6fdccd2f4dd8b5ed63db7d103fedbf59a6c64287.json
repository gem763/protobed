Trump announced Thursday that he was canceling his trip to Poland so he could be in the U.S. to monitor Hurricane Dorian\u2019s expected landfall. He spent several hours at his golf resort in Virginia on Saturday before flying to Camp David, then attended a Federal Emergency Management Agency briefing on Sunday.\n\nIn a slightly tortured comparison, Pence said at the ceremony: \u201cWhile the hearts of every American are with our fellow citizens in the path of a massive storm, today we remember how the gathering storm of the 20th century broke into warfare and invasion followed by the unspeakable hardship and heroism shown by the Polish people.\u201d\n\nHonored to join many world leaders tonight to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II. We will never forget the heroes lost and the character, faith and determination of the Polish people during such a dark time of authoritarian rule. pic.twitter.com/OcCYceoy7h \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) September 1, 2019\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda said it was difficult to even imagine now that \u201ccataclysm of history ... which brought the most disastrous consequences in the history of mankind.\u201d\n\nDuda scolded Europe for not standing up to Adolf Hitler sooner, saying, \u201cPerhaps the Second World War would not have broken out in the first place if the states in the west had put up a decisive resistance against \u2026 the imperial ambitions of Hitler.\u201d\n\nThe Polish president also criticized Western leaders who have been soft on Russian President Vladimir Putin after Moscow\u2019s aggression in Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe are still faced, even in Europe, with the return of imperialist tendencies. ... Closing one\u2019s eyes is not a recipe for peace,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a simple way ... to give permission for further attacks.\u201d\n\nPutin was not invited to the events.\n\nTrump clashed with world leaders at the G-7 summit last week as he battled to have Russia reinstated to the association. The country was ousted after Russia illegally annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Merkel and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson argued that Russia had grown even more anti-democratic since then, CNN reported, and Russia was not readmitted to the group.\n\nPence met Sunday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to pledge U.S. support for the nation.", "description": "Frank-Walter Steinmeier joined world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, in Warsaw.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6c911e3b00007902cabfc2.jpeg?cache=w4rdbfjcxe&ops=1778_1000"}
