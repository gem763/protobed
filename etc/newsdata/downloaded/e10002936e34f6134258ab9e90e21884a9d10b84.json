Reactions to reactions to reactions. I am a writer, I come from Tolstoy, from Homer, from Cervantes. Leave me in peace and don\u2019t ask me questions like that.\u201d\n\nAccording to ORF, the playwright and novelist said he would never talk to journalists again.\n\nThe exchange came after he was asked about criticism from Sa\u0161a Stani\u0161i\u0107, a Bosnian-German novelist who won the German Book prize on Monday night.\n\n\u201cI had the good fortune to escape what Peter Handke failed to describe in his texts\u201d, Stani\u0161i\u0107 said in his acceptance speech. \u201cI am able to stand here in front of your because of a reality that this person failed to accept.\u201d\n\nNumerous other writers, including Salman Rushdie and Hari Kunzru, have criticised the Nobel committee for the award of this year\u2019s prize to Handke. In an article in the New York Times, Aleksandar Hemon, a Bosnian-American novelist, called Handke \u201cthe Bob Dylan of genocide apologists\u201d.\n\nThe Swedish Academy has been contacted repeatedly for a response to the criticism but has yet to respond.\n\nHandke, whose best-known works include the novel The Goalkeeper\u2019s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick, the play Offending the Audience and his screenplay for Wim Wenders\u2019 Wings of Desire, was for long one of the most celebrated Austrian writers of the postwar era, alongside Thomas Bernhard and Elfriede Jelinek.\n\nBut during the Yugoslav war of the 1990s, Handke, who has Slovene roots on his maternal side, developed a strongly pro-Serbian stance, resulting in his 1996 book A Journey to the Rivers: Justice for Serbia, in which he painted Serbia as the true victim of the conflict.\n\nIn 2006 he spoke at the funeral of the Serbian war criminal Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, declaring: \u201cI don\u2019t know the truth. But I look. I listen. I feel. I remember. This is why I am here today, close to Yugoslavia, close to Serbia, close to Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107.\u201d", "description": "Writer says he will not talk to media again after repeated questions about his politics", "authors": ["Philip Oltermann"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cebb55a3e687d6916e293d3786764a447abbd9a/0_140_4179_2507/master/4179.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=65b396b3a0198d50f87fb0b958770153", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
