(Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nD.C. public safety agencies will adopt policies to ensure that life-threatening building code violations are promptly addressed, an effort to prevent the kind of missteps that preceded a deadly fire last month in Brightwood Park, officials said Wednesday.\n\nThe policies dictate that District police officers report potential fire code violations to a supervisor, who will relay the complaint to the Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department through the District\u2019s dispatch center. A fire battalion chief will immediately respond to the site to perform an inspection, Fire Chief Gregory M. Dean said.\n\n\u201cThe goal is that we would try to get there within 30 minutes,\u201d Dean said in an interview. \u201cThe idea behind this is that the [police] officer may not know if it\u2019s a building or a fire-code violation. It\u2019s much easier for the fire department go out there.\u201d\n\nDean said he hopes to implement the new policy this week. Police Chief Peter Newsham on Tuesday signed an executive order establishing the procedures for the city\u2019s police force.\n\nThe rapid-response protocols stand in contrast to the handling of a police officer\u2019s report about a rowhouse on Kennedy Street NW, which received a much-criticized response from city housing code inspectors. An investigator from the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs visited the property multiple times but closed the case without action when he could not get inside the rowhouse, DCRA Director Ernest Chrappah said.\n\nPolice say that conditions inside that house \u201ccontributed to the deaths\u201d of 9-year-old Yafet Solomon and 40-year-old Fitsum Kebede in a fire on Aug. 18.\n\n[Rowhouse that burned had no approval for rental units]\n\nThe tenants, mostly Ethio\u00adpian immigrants, described a warren of rooms, each no bigger than a queen-size bed. An application for a search warrant after the fire also identified a metal gate that could not be opened from the inside, as well as an electrical system insufficient for the number of people living in the house.\n\nThe owner of the house, James G. Walker, has not responded to interview requests.\n\nCity officials are conducting multiple internal reviews of how the case was handled. Four District employees have been placed on administrative leave \u2014 two at the fire department and two at DCRA.\n\nThe consumer and regulatory affairs agency is also reviewing nearly 70 cases closed since December \u2014 some involving the same investigator who responded to the report about the Kennedy Street house \u2014 to determine whether those cases should be reopened.\n\nMayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) ordered the new protocols. She also has commissioned an independent study to determine what went wrong and called for a criminal investigation into the fire.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that our agencies should have done more to better protect our residents,\u201d City Administrator Rashad M. Young said last week.\n\nThe deadly fire has focused attention on the dangerously cramped living conditions endured by some District residents desperate for affordable housing in an increasingly expensive city \u2014 and on the effectiveness of the bureaucracy tasked with ensuring that those conditions do not become fatal.\n\n[D.C. mayor calls for criminal investigation into fatal rowhouse fire]\n\nA police officer who visited 708 Kennedy St. NW on an unrelated call in March emailed fire and DCRA officials to warn of potential fire code violations in what appeared to be an unlicensed rooming house.\n\nAn incident report the officer sent described \u201cmake shift doors with locks which would make it difficult to exit in an emergency.\u201d The officer said he would \u201cstrongly recommend\u201d that inspectors visit the property. Portions of his report were written in bold for emphasis.\n\nWhen no action was taken, the police officer followed up with multiple emails. Eventually, an investigator from the DCRA went to the house to determine whether it was being used in an unlicensed manner but closed the case when he could not gain entry.\n\nIt is unclear how many other officials \u2014 at the fire department or the DCRA \u2014 were aware of the police officer\u2019s warning. Dean, the fire chief, said his agency is reconstructing how the complaint was handled and determining why no fire code inspection was performed at Kennedy Street NW.\n\nDean said fire officials tried to visit a second property flagged in the police officer\u2019s report but gave up when they determined that he had provided an invalid address. The officer mistakenly wrote the address as 5410 14th St. NW. The correct address is 5310 14th St. NW.\n\nOn Friday night, city officials used a search warrant to inspect that house, discovering a \u201cjunky and unkempt\u201d single-family residence that had been divided into nine rooms, with nonworking smoke detectors and a sliced power cord, according to a report.\n\nThe owner of that property, Chidi Anyanwutaku, confirmed to The Washington Post that he charged rent but disputed some of the inspectors\u2019 findings.\n\nRead more:\n\nInvestigators examining electronics in fatal D.C. rowhouse fire\n\nInvestigators: Conditions contributed to deaths in unlicensed rental property\n\nPolice flagged dangers at rowhouse months before fatal fire\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The city continues to investigate the handling of an unlicensed rooming house where a blaze killed two people.", "authors": ["Peter Jamison", "Local Enterprise Reporter", "Peter Hermann", "Reporter Covering Crime", "Specifically The D.C.
