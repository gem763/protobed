'20 to 25 per cent of the money has to go to solidarity payments. The historical coefficient would be a good place to look for money.\n\n'The big leagues are prepared to participate in this discussion for something new if they are treated the same. But if you are giving four positions to the Premier League and taking one away from the Bundesliga then you have a problem.'\n\nChelsea receive the most money out of English clubs this season due to recent records\n\nManchester City and Tottenham are the other English Champions League teams this season\n\nThe European Leagues remain locked in a stand-off with the European Clubs Association over proposals to reform the Champions League, with some of the biggest clubs pushing for an expansion to guarantee more games and even the establishment of a closed European league.\n\nJuventus chairman and head of the ECA Andrea Agnelli told Leaders that change is needed to keep football relevant to children due to the threat posed by e-sports and gaming, but he has yet to gain the support of the majority of clubs.\n\n'If we are not progressive, we are simply protecting a system that is no longer there, a system that is made of domestic games that will have little interest for our kids,' Agnelli said. 'We want to see more European matches with higher sporting quality.'", "description": "Premier League clubs could lose an automatic Champions League qualifying places and over \u00a325m of income as the battle to control the future of European football continues to intensify.", "authors": ["Matt Hughes For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/16/19448566-0-image-a-40_1570547958585.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
