You can\u2019t build your way out of a sticky situation. To take control of a fight, you\u2019ll need to close the gap between you and the enemy squad, utilizing cover along the way. If you don\u2019t know the intricacies of movement in this game you are a sitting duck.\n\nAD\n\nJordan \u201cHusKers\u201d Thomas, a professional Apex Legends player with Rogue, said to use the sliding mechanic in Apex Legends to cover more ground. That\u2019s especially important with this new map, World\u2019s Edge, which has more open space.\n\nAD\n\nInstead of running in a straight line, Thomas recommends you slide for half a second, jump and keep sprinting. Repeat this cadence every two to three seconds and you\u2019ll be scooting around the map in no time.\n\nTSM\u2019s Mac \u201cAlbralelie\u201d Kenzie Beckwith also added that you can bounce off walls to gain more momentum and also bunny hop while healing or holding a weapon, making you a harder target to hit.\n\nBunny hopping is best understood when seen, but essentially, you go in and out of a slide, crouched while strafing left and right to gain momentum. It\u2019s faster than sliding with a weapon and gives you speed while you heal or recharge your shields.\n\nAD\n\nBeckwith also pointed to the importance of strafing while looting so you make it harder for the enemy to snipe you when you aren\u2019t looking.\n\n\u201cOne thing that I think is overlooked by a lot of players is just learning the movement, like really in depth getting into the mechanics and learning as much as you can,\u201d Beckwith said.\n\nAD\n\nSelect the right weapons\n\nNot all weapons are created equal in Apex Legends, and the relative strength of them depends on the current patch.\n\nPlayers agree that the best close range weapon is the R-99 submachine gun, as well as the Peacekeeper. With the more open World\u2019s Edge, longer and mid-range weapons like the Wingman, Scout (recently buffed) and R-301 assault rifle will do the trick.\n\nAD\n\nThe newly introduced Charge Rifle also helps close gaps, as the laser has zero bullet drop. If you see one, do your team a favor and pick it up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the strongest gun in the game right now,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to know how to properly use the weapons in your inventory. Apex Predator Zachary \u201cBySovereign\u201d Bent, who is also on the \u201cPlay with Pros\u201d roster of ProGuides, said you should save the best weapons for last. First, break up their armor, then go in with your strong close range weapon while they are healing.\n\nAD\n\nYou\u2019ll want to set your goal for 1,500 damage a game, anything above that, Bent said, is a bonus.\n\nClose the door behind you\n\nUsing the map to your advantage in any battle royale is the key to victory. In Apex Legends, that means closing the door behind you.\n\nAD\n\nMany players forget to close the door, which makes it all the easier for enemies to engage you from outside. If you health drops low and you want to loot while you are safe, it\u2019s important to remember to shut the door. You wouldn\u2019t leave the front door to your house wide open, would you?\n\nYou can also sacrifice the equipment in your legend\u2019s kit to block the door. Caustic\u2019s Nox Gas Trap, Wattson\u2019s Interception Pylon or Lifeline\u2019s D.O.C. Heal Drone can also delay enemies from entering a building.\n\nThomas said there\u2019s more to just opening and closing doors throughout the map. You can \u201csit\u201d right in front of the door to prevent the enemy from entering immediately. The enemy has to take a few seconds to kick down the door (two strikes) or cook a grenade to blow it open, leaving you time to catch your breath and heal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShields before heals\n\nOne quick note while we\u2019re on the subject of healing, Thomas also advises you to pop your shield recharges before your health supplies. One shield cell takes three seconds to complete, while a syringe takes five seconds.\n\n\u201cThat extra second or two could potentially save your life,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nBe aggressive\n\nTaking fights is one of the best ways you can improve because that\u2019s the only way to ensure a win when you reach the final circle. Even if you avoid the rest of the teams for the entire game it will still come down to your mechanics and skill in combat.\n\n\u201cWhen you play, play to fight, don\u2019t play to win the game because the guy that has more experience in combat will always win at the end of the game,\u201d said TSM\u2019s Philip \u201cImperialHal\u201d Dosen.\n\nAD\n\nBeyond just practice, the game rewards you for being aggressive and taking the most advantageous fights, Bent said. At the same time, taking the worst fight as possible improves your ability to think on your feet and perform under pressure. Taking these fights to improve your mechanical ability will mean you are going to die a lot, and the key is to not get frustrated and tilt yourself.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge mental factor,\u201d Bent said. \u201cHaving an open mind is the best.\u201d\n\nOnce your basic mechanics are set, life gets a lot easier.\n\nAt the same time, you need to know when to sit back and hunker down. If you are playing in ranked mode, take fights that you are confident you can win and wait for your moment. Save the bad-odds duels for the public lobbies.\n\nAD\n\nTeamwork makes the dream work\n\nBeyond everything else, Apex is a team game. There isn\u2019t even a standard solo mode option. Communication and trust are key if you want to succeed.\n\nFollowing through with a teammate\u2019s play, even if you don\u2019t agree with the decision, will usually produce a superior outcome than going Rambo on your own. It\u2019s always better to have strength in numbers.\n\nThis works even better with a preformed team. If you can select teammates who are like minded and have the same goals, where everyone is willing to put in the same amount of work, you\u2019re on the right path, said TSM\u2019s Jordan \u201cReps\u201d Wolfe.\n\nAD\n\nDosen said everyone on TSM\u2019s team was willing to carry their own weight. That\u2019s how they won the Preseason Invitational in Poland.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAll three of us want to win and that\u2019s what separates us from everyone else,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd if you are on your own, as many players all in solo queue are, try to communicate as much as possible. The pinging system in Apex can also be a good way to convey information to your teammates and alert them to enemy threats.\n\nRead more from The Post:", "description": "Wanna better yourself in a battle royale?
