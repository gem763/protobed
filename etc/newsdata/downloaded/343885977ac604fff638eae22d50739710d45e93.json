She was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nOfficers had been dispatched to Jefferson\u2019s house about 2:30 a.m. Saturday in response to a non-emergency call from a neighbor who noticed the doors were open and asked for a welfare check. Jefferson\u2019s mother had recently been hospitalized and the neighbor wanted to make sure she was all right, family members and city officials said.\n\nFort Worth interim police chief Ed Kraus appeared to defend Jefferson\u2019s actions in a news conference Tuesday, saying it \u201cmakes sense that she would have a gun if she felt she was being threatened or if there was someone in the backyard.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no excuse for this incident,\u201d he said, \u201cand the person responsible will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTexas has a \u201ccastle doctrine\u201d law that gives people broad latitude to use fatal force to defend themselves in their homes. The controversial law came up in the recent trial of Amber Guyger, a white former police officer in Dallas who fatally shot Botham Jean, her unarmed black neighbor, in his apartment in 2018. Guyger, who killed Jean after mistaking his unit for her own, was convicted of murder and sentenced to 10 years in prison earlier this month.\n\nBody camera footage released by police showed two officers peering into Jefferson\u2019s house through a pair of screen doors, then walking stealthily into the backyard. Dean shined a flashlight into a closed window and, without identifying himself as police, shouted, \u201cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\u201d A split-second later, he opened fire, killing Jefferson. There is no indication in the footage that he saw Jefferson holding the gun.\n\nAD\n\nDean, 34, joined the department in April 2018. He was released from jail Monday on a $200,000 bond. An attorney for Dean could not be reached for comment.\n\nAD\n\nDean declined to allow officers investigating the shooting to interview him, according to the affidavit. But investigators did interview an officer who responded to the call with him. The officer, identified as C.A. Darch, told investigators Dean was standing between her and the house at the time of the shooting and that she could \u201conly see Jefferson\u2019s face\u201d through the window when Dean opened fire, according to the affidavit.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the shooting, police issued a statement saying Dean was searching the outside of the house when he saw someone in the window, and, \u201cperceiving a threat,\u201d fired a single shot. Along with the body camera footage, police released blurry images of a gun they said they found at the residence, but they did not indicate whether Jefferson was holding it or near it.\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price told people to disregard the weapon. \u201cThe gun is irrelevant,\u201d Price said in a news conference. Jefferson \u201cwas in her own home caring for an 8-year-old nephew.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLee Merritt, a civil rights attorney representing the family, said Jefferson had a license to carry the gun. He cried foul on the department\u2019s decision to release images of the weapon, accusing police of trying to \u201cimpute some bad act or blame on the victim.\u201d\n\nJefferson, a graduate of Xavier University who worked in pharmaceutical equipment sales, was an avid gamer who loved playing with her nephew, Merritt said. On the night she was killed, they had left the doors open to let a breeze through the house. They had lost track of time playing the military video game \u201cCall of Duty\u201d when they heard someone outside, according to Merritt.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe and his Auntie Tay experienced the fear of somebody prowling in the backyard,\u201d Merritt said, using Jefferson\u2019s nickname. \u201cHis Auntie Tay did not allow him to check the window. She checked herself. I ask myself what would have happened if that little boy went to window instead of his auntie.\"\n\nAD\n\nJefferson\u2019s nephew will start receiving trauma counseling this week, Merritt said, adding that the boy had spent time consoling his mother after the shooting. \u201cHe has found a way to maintain more composure than the Fort Worth Police Department,\u201d he said.\n\nMerritt and the family are calling for an independent probe of the police department and Jefferson\u2019s killing, saying they think her death was part of a pattern of racial bias. City officials said they are preparing to bring in a third-party panel of national experts to review the department\u2019s policies and training practices, along with an independent police monitor.\n\nAD\n\nKraus, the police chief, acknowledged Tuesday that Jefferson\u2019s killing has shattered trust between law enforcement and the community.\n\n\u201cWe must now work even harder to ensure that trust is restored,\u201d Kraus said at Tuesday\u2019s news conference.\n\nAD\n\nHis voice quavering, he implored the community to not let Dean\u2019s actions reflect on the rest of the department.\n\n\u201cThe officers, they try hard every day to try to make this city better,\u201d Kraus said. \u201cI likened it to a bunch of ants building an anthill, and if somebody comes with a hose and washes it away they just have to start from scratch.\u201d\n\nHe then abruptly ended the news conference and left the podium.\n\nAD", "description": "The Fort Worth police chief appeared to defend Jefferson, saying it \"makes sense that she would have a gun if she felt she was being threatened.\" The officer, Aaron Dean, has been charged with murder.", "authors": ["Derek Hawkins", "National", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/X-4qbIrRkwvzQC0DCojIq19r4FI=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-15-2019/t_35e7026392fc43c3a46de62f182f29b2_name_20191015_Jefferson_presser_Clips_THumb_2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
