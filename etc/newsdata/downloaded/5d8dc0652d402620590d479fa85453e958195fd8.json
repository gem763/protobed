After his helmet banged against Williams' helmet, Barnett was penalized for unnecessary roughness. Williams lay motionless on the field for several minutes while being tended to by a host of medical personnel. He raised his arm to flash the thumbs-up signal as he was being rolled away, and Barnett was the first player to approach him with a pat of encouragement.\n\nThe Packers went on to score on a short touchdown run by Aaron Jones, who was the only healthy tailback left after Williams' departure.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWilliams had feeling and movement in all of his extremities, the Packers announced, but he was ruled out for the remainder of the game while being evaluated for head and neck injuries.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "description": "Green Bay running back Jamaal Williams has been taken off the field on a stretcher, after taking a helmet-to-helmet hit from Philadelphia defensive end Derek Barnett on the first offensive play of the game for the Packers.
