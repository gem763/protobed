(AP Photo/John Locher,File)\n\nTHE KEY\n\nPRINCETON, N.J. \u2014 If Russian hackers seek to disrupt the 2020 election, it will be county election officials on the front lines. And some are diving in to war games so they can be ready for anything Moscow or another U.S. adversary can throw at them.\n\nElection officials from New Jersey\u2019s 21 counties huddled at tables in a hotel ballroom here, hashing out how they\u2019d respond to Election Day cyberattacks. In some attack scenarios, hackers shut down voter registration databases, loaded voter files with phony information, or compromised county social media accounts so they start spreading false information about polling locations. They also prepared for what happens if attackers locked up election office computers with ransomware or shut down cellphone towers across multiple states.\n\nHow the U.S. fares during an Election Day hack is likely to rest on the response of local election administrators in the first few hours, state and federal officials told me.\n\n\u201cThe county level is where all the risk is,\u201d a Homeland Security Department cybersecurity official who was helping one county with its response-planning told me. \u201cThey own it in a way no state official does and certainly no federal official could. It\u2019s always live or die at the county level.\u201d\n\nThe war-games are a sign of how drastically local politics has changed in this new era of cyberwar -- preparing responses to attacks by a powerful nation-state is a far cry from more ordinary tasks of getting poll workers to voting locations on time and planning contingency operations for storms or other physical disasters. And there's no turning back, as federal offiicals have warned Russia is likely to try to repeat its hacking and disinformation campaign in 2020 and other U.S. adversaries, including China, Iran and North Korea, may try as well.\n\n\"I regret to report that I believe it will get worse before it gets better,\" former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson, who oversaw DHS\u2019s response to Russia\u2019s 2016 election operation, told the New Jersey county officials during a lunchtime speech.\n\nMore than a dozen states have held election hacking war games for county officials during the past two years \u2014 many of them with help from the Department of Homeland Security. But the vast majority of those exercises have been done behind closed doors.\n\nDuring the New Jersey exercise, county election officials had five minutes to game out a response plan to each hypothetical attack \u2014 typically getting their ideas by flipping through thick binders where they keep plans for all kinds of contingency scenarios.\n\nEvery time a county didn\u2019t come up with a plan within the five-minute limit \u2013 or came up with a bad plan \u2014 a facilitator made a note in the county\u2019s evaluation. In the coming months, state election officials will be poring over those evaluations and working one-on-one with county officials to fix everything they did wrong, officials said.\n\nIn some cases, county officials told me they\u2019d already worked out detailed responses to numerous types of cyberattacks. In other cases, the counties were only beginning to game-plan out how they might respond to digital attacks.\n\nCounties have trained for years to keep elections running despite physical disasters such as hurricanes and disease outbreaks, but they\u2019ve been on a crash course learning about responding to cyberattacks since the 2016 election, Robert Giles, director of the New Jersey Division of Elections, told me.\n\n\u201cWe've evolved so much since 2016 and I think the counties have a good handle on it now,\u201d Giles told me. \u201cThe point of this exercise is to get them to think about all the potential things that could happen \u2026 Doing their due diligence and having a plan in place so they can be responsive.\u201d\n\nThe exercises also give DHS a better idea of where the agency can offer more help to local election officials, Chris Krebs, director of DHS\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told reporters on the sidelines of the exercise. Krebs\u2019s agency has been racing across the nation to do cybersecurity testing and training for state and local election officials since soon after Russia\u2019s hacking and influence operation undermined the 2016 contest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about both knowing what to do on a bad day but also issue spotting beforehand so we can minimize the chances of those things happening,\u201d he said.\n\nYou are reading The Cybersecurity 202, our must-read newsletter on cybersecurity policy news.

(Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nPINGED: Authorities arrested 281 fraudsters worldwide yesterday as part of an effort to disrupt a growing number of scams designed to dupe businesses and individuals into sending wire transfers for fraudulent reasons, the Justice Department announced in a news release. Dubbed \u201cOperation reWired,\u201d the effort took place over four months and included 74 arrests in the United States plus 169 in Nigeria and others in Kenya, Turkey, France and elsewhere.\n\nThe IRS, which assisted in the investigation, found that conspirators stole more than 250,000 identities and filed more than 10,000 fraudulent tax returns to collect nearly $100 million in refunds. Authorities seized nearly $3.7 million in total.\n\nIn \u201cbusiness email compromise\u201d schemes, criminals impersonate a company\u2019s employees over email to convince other employees to wire them money.

(Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\nPATCHED: President Trump\u2019s firing of national security adviser John Bolton on Tuesday removes one of the administration\u2019s most significant architects of cybersecurity policy.\n\nDuring his tenure, Bolton pushed a new, offensive cybersecurity strategy aimed at ratcheting up pain for U.S. cyber adversaries that included retaliatory cyberattacks against Russia and Iran.\n\nBolton was also responsible for eliminating a key White House cybersecurity coordinator position \u2014 which drew harsh criticism from cyber pros who said it would make it far tougher for the government to make key cybersecurity policy decisions. It's not clear how any of those policies will play out under Bolton's sucessor.\n\nHere\u2019s a take from Politico\u2019s Eric Geller:\n\nBolton's cyber legacy:\n\n\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Eliminating WH cyber coordinator job\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Downgrading homeland security adviser\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Pushing for more aggressive operations to deter & punish\n\n\n\nHe was especially in sync with other officials on 3\ufe0f\u20e3 (see NSPM 13 & CyberCom's \"persistent engagement\" strategy). \u2014 Eric Geller (@ericgeller) September 10, 2019\n\nThe Iowa state flag. (Charlie Neibergall/AP)\n\nPWNED: State election officials are pushing back against a report released by cybersecurity company NormsShield yesterday dinging a number of unnamed state election offices for leaving their systems vulnerable to digital attacks.\n\nVermont Secretary of State Jim Condos pointed to a number of possible discrepancies in the report, including that email accounts that NormShield said were breached did not belong to the office's domain. \"At best it appears to be reflective of the State of [Vermont] IT systems \u2014 not the Secretary of State\u2019s office,\u201d Condos said. \u201cWe operate on our systems separate from the state.\u201d\n\nIowa's Secretary of State Paul Pate said his office stopped using the domain NormShield scanned (state.ia.us) years ago.\n\n\u201cYou would think a firm that claims expertise in cybersecurity could do a simple Google search to find the correct address of a state website,\u201d Pate said.\n\nNormShield's chief security officer, Bob Maley, shot back that his company also scanned the Iowa Secretary of State\u2019s current domain for cybersecurity weaknesses and \u201cfound very little difference.\u201d The erroneous domain came from a list maintained by the National Association of State Election Directors, he said.\n\nPUBLIC KEY\n\n\u2014 Cybersecurity news from the public sector:\n\nTrump extends national emergency on foreign election interference President Trump on Tuesday issued a notice extending a national emergency declaration over foreign interference in U.S. elections.
