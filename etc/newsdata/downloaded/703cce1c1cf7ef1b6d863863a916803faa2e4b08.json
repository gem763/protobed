The majority of the action and travel chaos is likely to be centred around the 12 sites \u2013 which XR aims to \u2018take\u2019 this morning before setting up accommodation there.\n\nAll of Westminster and the surrounding areas seem likely to face severe transport disruption, but each \u2018rebellion\u2019 site has been given a different name and tends to be located near specific government departments or strategic locations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose include actions planned for near the Ministry of Defence (\u2018Peace\u2019); the Ministry for Digital, Culture Media and Sport (\u2018Beyond Politics\u2019); one next to Parliament, at Victoria Tower Gardens (\u2018Global Justice\u2019); two near the Department for Environmental and Rural Affairs (\u2018Rewilding North\u2019 and \u2018Animal City\u2019); and one stretching between the Home Office and Department for Transport (\u2018We Are All Crew\u2019).\n\nThe areas being targeted in a fortnight of activism (Picture: Extinction Rebellion)\n\nMeanwhile, \u2018Burning Earth\u2019 will be stationed around Trafalgar Square, \u2018Global Food Justice\u2019 on Lambeth Bridge and \u2018The Beacon\u2019 on Westminster Bridge.\n\nStrangers raise \u00a3500,000 for boy, 5, to get cancer treatment\n\nAlso being targeted are areas near the Department Of Business, Energy and Industrial strategy (\u2018Power In Truth\u2019); Horse Guards Road, near the Foreign Office (\u2018Love Rebellion\u2019); and The Mall (\u2018The Future Is Here\u2019).\n\nXR \u2013 which says exact timings for its plans could change depending on \u2018the mood of the state\u2019 \u2013 claims around 10,000 volunteers have confirmed they will join the action, compared to 2,000 who said they would join April\u2019s \u2018rebellion\u2019 \u2013 when more than 1,000 people were arrested and various London landmarks saw major disruption.\n\n5,000 say they are willing to be arrested, 2,245 are willing to go to prison and 1,836 are prepared to go on hunger strike, the group say \u2013 adding that they expect their numbers will swell to between 20,000 and 30,000 during the action.\n\nDemonstrations are taking place around the world \u2013 including in Sydney, Australia (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nActivists block an intersection in Melbourne, Australia (Picture: Reuters)\n\nThe group have vowed to stay until the government \u2018tells the truth\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWriting about its plans online, the group say: \u2018We will create a spectacular Rebellion. In addition to a family-friendly blockade of Westminster, there will be non-violent and creative disruptive actions to force the Government to train its focus on protecting the country from risks that have been ignored for decades by those in power.\u2019\n\n\u2018There will be a dizzying display of arts and performances to highlight visions and voices about what our future could be, if only the Government would act. This a future where our cultures are resilient, regenerative, and built on respect for one another, all other forms of life, and the planet that sustains us.\u2019\n\nTomorrow, the group plan to \u2018occupy or block all Government departments around Westminster\u2019 but say they will not prevent civil servants from going about their work.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police did not immediately respond to Metro.co.uk\u2019s questions about their plans for the demonstrations.\n\nTo keep up to date with the events \u2013 which have already seen arrests and road blocks this morning \u2013 click here for updates.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
