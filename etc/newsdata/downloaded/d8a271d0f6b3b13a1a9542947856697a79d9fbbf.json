REUTERS/Edgar Su/Files\n\nEleven economists polled by Reuters late last week all expect the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to loosen policy at a meeting due to take place no later than Oct. 14.\n\nThis compared to seven out of 11 economists calling for an easing in a July Reuters poll.\n\nLast week, Singapore reported disappointing manufacturing production figures for August as electronics output plunged, the latest in a slew of weak data that is fueling fears of a recession in the city-state.\n\n\u201cThe much worse-than-expected August industrial production outturn increases the conviction in our view that the MAS will ease foreign exchange policy,\u201d Nomura said in a note to clients on Thursday.\n\nOne of the world\u2019s busiest ports, Singapore has been hit hard by the escalating Sino-U.S. trade dispute, which has disrupted global supply chains in a blow to business investment and corporate profits.\n\nEarlier this month, economists sharply cut their forecasts for Singapore\u2019s growth in 2019, citing trade tensions and China\u2019s slowdown as the top risks to the financial hub.\n\nAnalysts also expect expansionary measures on the fiscal side, especially as elections are due to be held within months.\n\nSingapore\u2019s finance minister said last week the government would do \u201cwhat needs to be done\u201d to aid the economy.\n\nThe central bank manages monetary policy through exchange rate settings rather than interest rates, letting the Singapore dollar rise or fall against the currencies of its main trading partners within an undisclosed policy band.\n\nThe MAS can use several tools to change policy but most commonly it will adjust the so-called slope of this band, which determines the pace at which the currency can move.\n\nSingapore\u2019s advance estimate for third-quarter GDP growth and MAS semiannual monetary policy statement will be released on the same day in October.\n\nIn the second quarter, the economy contracted 3.3% on a seasonally adjusted and annualised quarter-on-quarter basis. From a year earlier, it expanded 0.1%, the slowest pace in a decade.", "description": "Singapore's central bank is expected to ease monetary policy at its semi-annual meeting in October in a bid to boost a trade-reliant economy being choked by the prolonged U.S-China trade war, economists said.", "authors": ["Fathin Ungku", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435417176&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T0A0", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
