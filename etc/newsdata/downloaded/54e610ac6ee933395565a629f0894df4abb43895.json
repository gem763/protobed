Among a trove of encrypted texts that Mr. Volker turned over to Congress last week, this message is brief and informal. It is also a textbook example of a quid pro quo, one intended to advance not American foreign policy goals but Donald Trump\u2019s re-election.\n\nAs the Ukraine scandal continues to unfold, there has been much disagreement about whether Mr. Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid to the former Soviet republic in an attempt to bully its government into pursuing investigations that would benefit him politically. Mr. Trump had demanded that Ukraine look into whether former Vice President Joe Biden misused his office to protect his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. (There has been no evidence to suggest this.) He also wanted an inquiry into the (debunked) conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016. Democrats say Mr. Trump\u2019s extortion attempt is undeniable, and even a few Republican lawmakers have expressed discomfort. But most members of the president\u2019s party have stuck by him, insisting that a direct connection is not clear.\n\nBut Mr. Volker\u2019s offer of July 25 could not have been more clear: If Mr. Zelensky agreed to give Mr. Trump the investigations he so desperately wanted, then Mr. Trump would give Mr. Zelensky the White House visit he so needed as a sign of the United States\u2019 continued support of Ukraine in its conflict with Russia. It is an exchange so explicit that even Mr. Trump\u2019s fiercest apologists cannot wish it away.", "description": "Republican lawmakers were incensed.
