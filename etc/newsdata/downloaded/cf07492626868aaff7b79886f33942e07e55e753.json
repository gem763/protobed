Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry the next day.\n\nDemocrats in favor of impeachment and outraising GOP challengers\n\nOf those seven Democrats, four represent districts that President Trump won in 2016, and have among the highest amounts raised in the quarter. Democrats Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey have raised a combined $2.29 million dollars in the third quarter alone.\n\nSlotkin won Michigan's Eighth District by four points after President Trump won it by seven points. In the third quarter, she raised more than $686,100 for her re-election bid. While she faces two GOP challengers, both filed in early October and neither reported cash raised for the quarter.\n\nOver in New Jersey, Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill won the Eleventh District by just one point after Trump won it in 2016 \u2014 also by just one point. She raised nearly $669,000 in the third quarter. While two challengers have jumped in the race, they raised just $650 combined by the end of the quarter.\n\nCongresswoman Lucy McBath of Georgia raised over $623,000 in the quarter and has $1.34 million cash on hand after winning the Sixth District seat by just one point in 2018. President Trump won it by 1.5 points two years earlier. None of her four challengers were able to raise more than half of what she raised in the third quarter.\n\nIn all, Democrats in Trump-won districts that have voiced support for the impeachment inquiry have together raised a combined total of around $11 million in direct contributions to their campaigns.\n\nDemocrats walking a fine line on impeachment and outraising GOP challengers\n\nAlternatively, a different set of six House Democrats in Trump districts have either opposed the impeachment inquiry or advocated for continuing investigations that are not an inquiry. All of them have outraised their GOP challengers in total thus far.\n\nIn Maine's second district, President Donald Trump won in 2016 by ten points. Democrat Jared Golden was then able to flip the district in 2018 by just two and a half points. Now, Golden has raised $382,000 raised in the quarter with $793,860 cash on hand. His closest challenger, Republican Eric Brakey, was not too far behind Golden, with $337,740 raised but he does not have the same war chest at his disposal.\n\nIn Oklahoma, Kendra Horn successfully flipped the Fifth District seat held by Republicans since 1975, after President Trump won the district by thirteen points. She raised nearly $510,000 in the third quarter and is sitting on a nearly $2 million war chest. Four of her Republican opponents together raised less than $300,000 in the third quarter; three other challengers have not reported fundraising totals.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Trump might have won Minnesota's Seventh District by 30 points in 2016, but Democratic Congressman Collin Peterson has represented it since 1991. Peterson raised nearly $159,100 in the third quarter while his three Republican challengers combined brought in just shy of $150,000. Republican Michelle Fischbach was able to raise more than $100,000 within 27 days of filing and recently was endorsed by House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nDemocrats being outraised in third quarter\n\nWhile the majority of Democrats representing Trump-won districts outraised their Republican challengers combined in the third quarter, it's not the case in every district.\n\nCongressman Joe Cunningham won South Carolina's First District by 8 points after Trump won it by 13 in 2016. He raised nearly $490,000, compared to his five Republican opponents' combined $536,675 in the third quarter. That said, Cunningham still has them beat overall with $1.3 million cash on hand.\n\nIn New Mexico, President Trump won the Second District by ten points before a Democrat was able to win in 2018 by two points. Congresswoman Xochitl Torres Small raised $557,191 in the third quarter, while her three Republican opponents combined raised nearly $654,233. Like Cunningham, Torres Small has more cash on hand with $1.7 million to their $1 million combined war chest closing September.\n\nCommittee Help\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which helps elects and retain House Democrats, raised $27.4 million from the months of July through September, which is about $6 million more than what the committee had in the third quarter of 2017, and leaves the Democratic campaign arm with a more than $36 million dollar war chest.\n\nBy comparison, the National Republican Campaign Committee brought in $15.8 million from July through September. The NRCC has leaned on the impeachment inquiry to criticize these Democrats in Trump districts, who are all on their 2020 target list to win back the House. Republicans will need at least 19 seats to do this.\n\nNRCC spokesman Michael McAdams said Democrats \"will need every penny to try and explain their unhealthy obsession with impeaching Trump.\" When asked about if he expects Republican challengers to catch up in fundraising as the election cycle continues, McAdams said \"We will see.\"", "description": "This is the case even as Republican opposition to Trump's impeachment remains high", "authors": ["Aaron Navarro", "Sarah Ewall-Wice"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/30/887be93b-b678-45c2-97e3-9bdba1e0c1f7/thumbnail/1200x630/a79f152aa0510b31ff085b9f79a23021/gettyimages-1175942092.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
