Schumer sounded fresh alarms Saturday over new reporting involving President Trump\u2019s Oval Office meeting with Russians in 2017.\n\nMr. Schumer, New York Democrat, raised concerns in a statement issued in response to The Washington Post reporting Friday that Mr. Trump said during the meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and then-Ambassador Sergey Kislyak that he was unconcerned Moscow had meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential race he won.\n\n\u201cIf true, the reports that @realDonaldTrump may have told close associates of Putin that he didn\u2019t mind Russian interference in the U.S. elections are extremely harmful to both our national security and the integrity of our elections,\u201d Mr. Schumer said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most disturbing things we\u2019ve learned yet. The White House should immediately provide the Congressional intelligence committees with all the records of that meeting so we can get to the bottom of it,\u201d Mr. Schumer tweeted.\n\nCiting three former officials familiar with the matter, the Post reported Friday evening that Mr. Trump said during the meeting that he was unconcerned about Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election because the U.S. acts similarly in other countries, alarming some White House officials and prompting them to restrict access to his remarks.\n\nThe White House did not comment for the Post\u2019s report, and the administration did not immediately return a message seeking reaction to Mr. Schumer\u2019s remark.\n\nFederal law enforcement and intelligence officials concluded that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 race. Several current and former members of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration have subsequently asserted that Moscow will meddle in next year\u2019s race.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
