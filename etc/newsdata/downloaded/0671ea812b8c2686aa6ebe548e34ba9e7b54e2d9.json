USA TODAY\n\nAs his Brooklyn Nets teammates were awaiting word on whether they'd end up playing their preseason game in China this week, Kevin Durant appeared on local New York City radio and dropped a harsh truth bomb on the crosstown rival New York Knicks.\n\nSpeaking on Hot 97 early Tuesday, Durant said younger players have not seen the Knicks be successful, and that the perception of the Knicks as a brand is somewhat warped.\n\n\u201cI get it,\" Durant said, \"it\u2019s hard to get the best players to play here.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why, the former MVP elaborated.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of fans look at the Knicks as a brand and expect these younger players, who in their lifetime don\u2019t remember the Knicks being good,\" he said. \"I didn\u2019t grow up with the Knicks being good. Well, I remember the Knicks being in the Finals, but the kids after me didn\u2019t see that. So the brand of the Knicks isn\u2019t as cool to them as, let\u2019s say, the Golden State Warriors or even the Lakers or the Nets now. The cool thing right now is not the Knicks.\u201d\n\nKevin Durant speaks about his decision to sign with the Brooklyn Nets & whether he ever considered signing with the Knicks. \ud83c\udfc0\n\n\n\nHe also discusses why he feels the Knicks aren't as much of an attraction for players today.\n\n\n\nWatch the full convo: https://t.co/P0SOcjH64Ipic.twitter.com/O4XkkL3KIm \u2014 HOT 97 (@HOT97) October 8, 2019\n\nEarlier in the interview, Durant admitted he \"thought about\" signing with the Knicks this past offseason. He ended up picking the Nets along with guard Kyrie Irving.\n\n\u201cI thought about it, yeah,\u201d Durant said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a thought. I didn\u2019t really do any full analysis on the Knicks.\u201d", "description": "Nets star Kevin Durant, in a radio interview Tuesday, said free agents don't go to the Knicks because \"the cool thing right now is not the Knicks.\"", "authors": ["Chris Bumbaca", "Published P.M.
