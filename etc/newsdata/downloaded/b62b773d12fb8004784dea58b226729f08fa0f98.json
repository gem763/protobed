Every day I felt strung out and I quickly spiralled into a deep depression.\n\nTwo weeks later, as my mum Gillian and I sat in the car together, I broke down.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m hearing voices in my head,\u2019 I blurted out through my tears.\n\nShe arranged for me to have an emergency mental health assessment.\n\nThree doctors assessed me and came to the conclusion the voices were a consequence of depression and anxiety, so I was prescribed anti-depressants.\n\nOne doctor told me it\u2019s common for healthy adults to hear voices in times of stress, which was reassuring.\n\nTaking the medication helped my anxiety and depression, but still the voices would come back, usually at night.\n\nBy then they were saying full sentences and chatting together.\n\nOther times they\u2019d make basic statements like \u2018I really like apples\u2019.\n\nAnd within months a third voice joined in, this time a male around the same age as me.\n\n(Image: Supplied)\n\nI soon noticed they had three distinct personalities, and even heard their names.\n\nThe older man was called Eros and was definitely the ringleader.\n\nHis was the voice I\u2019d hear most often, and he loved to talk about himself in an egotistical way.\n\nTerry was the younger man, who tended to chat about college and high school, while Psyche, the female, was the kindest and often asked me about my day.\n\nThat said, they could all be malicious, and when I was anxious they\u2019d enjoy playing on my fears.\n\nIf I was on my way to university in Liverpool, where I was studying Creative Writing, they\u2019d insist the train was going to be late, or if I was just stressed they\u2019d agree something bad was about to happen.\n\nThe lower I felt, the more they\u2019d tell me I was fat and ugly, and over time my self-esteem plummeted.\n\nI knew the voices were a manifestation of my own brain, but hearing over and over again how worthless I was Ieft me believing it.\n\nI went back and forwards to doctors, but they were convinced it was due to depression and anxiety, and I felt reluctant to push for anything more.\n\nI know hearing voices can be symptoms of psychosis or schizophrenia, but sometimes it can be nothing to do with mental illness at all.\n\nBy the Christmas of my second year at university, it had all got too much to bear.\n\nI was still living at home, but I\u2019d withdrawn from my family.\n\nEventually I felt the only way out was to kill myself.\n\nOn 23 December I tried to write a suicide note but I couldn\u2019t concentrate, so to distract myself I scrolled through music videos on YouTube.\n\nI found myself enjoying Korean pop music and discovered that when\n\nI was listening to it the voices stopped, possibly because I was concentrating on another language.\n\nRelieved, I listened to it all night, and the following day I confided in my mum about how low I\u2019d got.\n\nShe was incredibly supportive and together we worked out strategies to cope with my anxiety.\n\nWhen I went back to university after the New Year I decided to try a new approach and befriend the voices.\n\nIt seemed to work, and now they are less malevolent and sometimes include me.\n\nOther times I can hear them chatting about politics or Brexit ; information I\u2019ve absorbed through the day.\n\nHowever when I need some peace, drowning them out with Korean pop seems to work.\n\nI also find if I ignore them they will eventually quieten down.\n\nNow they tend to only start up at night, unless I\u2019m stressed in which case they can materialise at any time and make me jump because I wasn\u2019t expecting them.\n\nThey still are evil occasionally, but most of the time we rub along pretty well together.\n\nTelling my friends was terrifying, as I thought it would change how they felt about me, but they\u2019ve all reacted brilliantly.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t had a negative impact on any friendships \u2013 and I hope in the future the voices won\u2019t stand in the way of me having a relationship either.\n\nAt university, as part of my degree, we had to produce the first chapter of a science fiction novel, and I decided to incorporate my own experiences into my story.\n\n(Image: Supplied)\n\nI started a tale called Nightmare Scenario set in 2047, where everyone has to wear a watch that tracks their every move.\n\nThe main character has voices in her head that force her to play a dangerous game by threatening to hurt her or others if she refuses.\n\nI found writing it cathartic, and felt if people were prepared to believe in this dystopian world they might also be more accepting and understanding of those who hear voices in their head.\n\nOnce I began to write, the words poured out of me, and within a month I\u2019d finished my first draft.\n\nI was stunned and thrilled when a publisher agreed to produce my novel and now I can\u2019t wait until it hits the shelves this month.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to talk about hearing voices because of the stigma, but it\u2019s important to be open about mental health.\n\nIllnesses like psychosis and schizophrenia only make the news when the voices inside someone\u2019s head have urged them to hurt someone or harm themselves.\n\nMine have never done either of those things, and I think it\u2019s important people know there\u2019s another side to the condition.\n\nOf course I hope one day Eros, Terry and Psyche will fade away, but for now I\u2019m managing to live alongside them, and I know they don\u2019t define who I am or what I can achieve.\n\nI\u2019m studying for a PhD and I hope to write more books in the Scenario series.\n\nI\u2019ve learnt to accept there\u2019s much more to me than just the voices in my head.\n\nHearing Voices: The Facts\n\nHearing voices is an auditory hallucination that may or may not be associated with mental illness.\n\nIt\u2019s the most common type of hallucination in people with psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, but a large number of otherwise healthy individuals have also reported hearing them.\n\nAccording to the Mental Health Foundation, between 5% and 28% of the population hears voices that other people do not.\n\nThe voices can be critical, complimentary or neutral, and may make potentially harmful commands or engage the person in conversation.\n\nThey may give a running commentary of the person\u2019s actions.\n\nTraumatic experiences, such as abuse, bereavement or neglect, are considered to be among the most significant triggers of auditory hallucinations, particularly among children.\n\nIn one study, up to 70% of participants reported that hearing voices started after a significant traumatic or emotional event.\n\n- Nightmare Scenario by Hazel Clarke (\u00a37.99, Salad Days) is available in book shops", "description": "Since she was a teenager, Hazel Clarke has been hearing three distinct voices in her head, all with different personalities, who talk about anything and everything, including Brexit - and all of whom are evi", "authors": ["Hazel Clarke", "Talking To Natasha Holt", "Image", "Getty Images", "Supplied"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20635938.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Me22.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
