I sound silly saying it but I believe Sinead is real. I played her for six-and-a-half years. Me and Corrie created this character and I feel like she\u2019s my friend.\u2019\n\nShe continued: \u2018Watching her die was just awful, but it\u2019s raising awareness and I just hope that we are doing that.\n\n\u2018I love this storyline because it covers so many issues. I just wanted to highlight the fact people are dying of cancer.\u2019\n\nSpeaking about filming the devastating last scenes with Katie, Rob Mallard explained: \u2018We spent two weeks in the bedroom set that was built. Eventually we had such emotional attachment in that room, when you were in there you were immediately back where you left it before. It wasn\u2019t difficult to get into, if anything it was difficult to not just cry, it all felt very real.\n\n\u2018Trying to play against that was hard, it\u2019s not hard to think of something to get you to cry.\u2019\n\nCoronation Street is next on Monday 28 October at 7:30pm on ITV.\n\nMORE: Coronation Street spoilers: Daniel Osbourne leaves the street after Sinead Tinker dies\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Sinead had been previously diagnosed with cervical cancer which eventually spread to her liver and lymph nodes.", "authors": ["Aidan Milan"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sinead-Tinker-in-Coronation-Street-213d_1572015793.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
