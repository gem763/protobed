The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%.\n\nFinancials outperformed the broader market as Treasury yields inched higher, pushing prices down. One of the biggest winners was Wells Fargo, whose shares climbed 4.2% after the U.S. bank appointed Charles Scharf president and chief executive. Mr. Scharf is leaving Bank of New York Mellon to succeed C. Allen Parker, interim CEO since Timothy Sloan resigned in late March. Shares of Bank of America added 1.1%.\n\nMeanwhile, investors sold traditionally safer assets like gold and U.S. government bonds, sending the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to 1.711%, according to Tradeweb, from 1.685% Thursday.\n\nFriday's move puts major indexes within an inch of their record highs.
