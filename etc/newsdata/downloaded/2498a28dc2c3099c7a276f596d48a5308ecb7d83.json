Photo: Courtesy of retailer\n\nWhen it comes to insulated, stainless steel water bottles, Hydro Flasks are top of the line, and right now, there\u2019s a bunch of different styles and colors on sale at Backcountry with the code CLIMBCAMP20. But these water bottles aren\u2019t just for those who climb and camp. Jonah Hill has been known to stay hydrated in the city with the 64-ounce growler (and influenced some of our colleagues at the Cut to do the same), Strategist managing editor Maxine Builder takes her currently-on-sale 32-ounce Hydro Flask to hot yoga, and VSCO Girl attire basically requires a sticker-covered one. Hydro Flasks aren\u2019t just for water, either. This sale includes reusable travel mugs for coffee, growlers for beer, even an insulated wine bottle, along with the classic wide- and standard-mouth water bottles. But don\u2019t dillydally: Certain colors are already starting to sell out.\n\nHydro Flask 64oz Growler $52 (was $65, now 20% off) $52 at Backcountry Buy with code: CLIMBCAMP20\n\nHydro Flask 40oz Wide Mouth Water Bottle $34 (was $43, now 21% off) $34 at Backcountry Buy with code: CLIMBCAMP20\n\nHydro Flask 21oz Standard Mouth Water Bottle $26 (was $33, now 21% off) $26 at Backcountry Buy with code: CLIMBCAMP20\n\nHydro Flask 18oz Wide Mouth Water Bottle $24 (was $30, now 20% off) $24 at Backcountry Buy with code: CLIMBCAMP20\n\nHydro Flask 64oz Wide Mouth Growler $48 (was $60, now 20% off) $48 at Backcountry Buy with code: CLIMBCAMP20\n\nHydro Flask 32oz Wide Mouth Water Bottle $32 (was $40, now 20% off) $32 at Backcountry Buy with code: CLIMBCAMP20\n\nHydro Flask 18oz Standard Mouth Water Bottle $24 (was $30, now 20% off) $24 at Backcountry Buy with code: CLIMBCAMP20\n\nHydro Flask 12oz Wide Mouth Water Bottle $18 (was $22, now 18% off) $18 at Backcountry Buy with code: CLIMBCAMP20\n\nHydro Flask 25oz Wine Bottle $36 (was $45, now 20% off) $36 at Backcountry Buy with code: CLIMBCAMP20\n\nHydro Flask 10oz Wine Tumbler $24 (was $30, now 20% off) $24 at Backcountry Buy with code: CLIMBCAMP20\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
