The pipeline started running dry on Saturday, leaving areas such as Kempton Park, Van Riebeeck Park, Spartan Airfield, Bedfordview, Tembisa, President Park and Halfway House without water.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Rand Water announced that, upon accessing and inspecting the O2 pipeline, it had established that the damage was worse than initially expected.\n\nREAD: Rand Water hopes to reconnect residents around Kempton Park on Monday\n\n'Work has been done'\n\nRand Water executive manager Eddie Singo said, by 05:00 on Monday morning, technicians had finished welding the pipe. He said the pipe had been cleared and water was now being allowed to flow through the line.\n\n\"That's a 1.8m pipeline in terms of diameter and vastness of the area, so we will start seeing water being supplied in the late afternoon. The work has been done, and all that is left now is rehabilitating,\" said Singo.\n\nHe said, while many other factors may have caused the burst, vandalism had not been ruled out. Singo added that it was established that there was a loose valve in the pipe.\n\nState of pipelines in Johannesburg\n\nHe said Rand Water was 114 years old and had parts that were over 50 years old, but the company regularly did inspections.\n\n\"Our conditions in comparisons with many other water boards, even internationally, I think we are doing fine. The condition of Rand Water pipelines is relatively good. There is nothing more than 5% of our pipes that we are not happy with,\" said Singo.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Rand Water says a burst pipeline, which left residents in some areas without water for most of the weekend, has been repaired.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8602/2cd423fa20094e2da0035adf9156ff55.png", "published_at": "2019-08-05"}
