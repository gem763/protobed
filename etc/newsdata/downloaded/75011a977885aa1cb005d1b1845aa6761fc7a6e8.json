Kyle Tangney, Herb Schwat, Greysteel The apartment building at 410 Cedar St. in Washington, D.C., is undergoing a multiyear restoration that aims to keep it affordable for its current residents and for generations to come.\n\nJennifer Sumler has lived in her apartment building on Cedar Street in the Takoma section of Washington, D.C., for her entire life, but the sound she heard one late November evening a few years ago was like nothing she\u2019d ever experienced.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden the sky got dark and there was a \u2018Wizard of Oz\u2019 moment,\u201d recalled Sumler, who\u2019s 50. \u201cLeaves started to whip up. There was this ferocious wind. Then there was this noise. It was loud and really otherworldly.\u201d\n\nAs sirens blared, she and several neighbors gathered outside in the leafy courtyard. Through the rain, they could see the source of that horrible noise: a huge portion of the roof had been ripped off.\n\nThe freak storm that night in 2016 displaced more than just the roof. Several neighbors were never to return. But for Sumler and a few others, it marked a turning point. Over the next few years, they\u2019d make the journey from discontented renters to affordable-housing advocates, resolved to keep 410 Cedar St. accessible to people of moderate means for generations to come.\n\nNearly three years later, they\u2019re not done. The financing to repair and renovate the 30-unit building has only now been agreed to and will take another year to finalize. By the time that happens, dozens of parties will have had a hand in the project: developers, community organizers, government workers, bankers, regulators, lawyers, property managers, a historical consultant, lobbyists, investors and more.\n\nThe story of 410 Cedar St. isn\u2019t just the story of one Washington, D.C., building; it\u2019s the story of how America creates \u201caffordable housing\u201d \u2014 and why it\u2019s so incredibly hard. Anytime a project comes together, it\u2019s thanks to a patchwork quilt of the public purse, private funding, regulatory incentives, tax quirks and even exceptional individuals like Sumler. Those involved aren\u2019t necessarily working against gentrification as much as working toward safe, stable, affordable housing, sometimes one neighborhood, one block or one unit at a time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that we have all these millennials and people moving into D.C. and we\u2019re seeing restaurants and night life pop,\u201d said Gerry Joseph, the real-estate developer whom the Cedar Street tenants eventually hired. \u201cBut you can\u2019t do it all at the expense of the people who\u2019ve been here their whole lives. It\u2019s important to try to save as many of [these older buildings] as we can. We\u2019re not going to save them all.\u201d\n\nA \u2018tool of equity\u2019\n\nWashington, D.C., a planned city from inception, is unique in many ways. In particular, it has made a strong public commitment to helping its residents access housing that\u2019s affordable, and providing tools that support tenants.\n\nIts mayor, Muriel Bowser, is \u201cdoing more for affordable housing than any other mayor in the country,\u201d said Kathryn Howell, an assistant professor of urban planning at Virginia Commonwealth University. Bowser committed $100 million a year to affordable housing in her first term, which began in 2015, and has increased the budgeted amount every year since.\n\nSome initiatives, such as city-budget dollars directed toward initiatives like the Cedar Street restoration, are Bowser\u2019s to claim. But the Cedar Street project owes its existence to Washington\u2019s TOPA, or Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, laws, which precede the mayor\u2019s tenure. It\u2019s this program that perhaps best illustrates the opportunity and complexity facing tenants, developers and other investors in the affordable-housing ecosystem.\n\nUnder TOPA, tenants of any building whose owner has decided to sell have the right to buy the building themselves. They can become owners in a condominium or cooperative conversion, or they can transfer their rights to someone they hire, usually a developer like Gerry Joseph, to keep the building operating in its rental format.\n\nD.C. provides the tenants of multifamily buildings resources to organize themselves, including matching them with legal counsel, for example. As long as the tenants (or their own developer) can match the bid that the building\u2019s owner receives on the open market, tenants are given priority.\n\nTOPA is \u201cone of the really unique things about D.C.\u2019s housing landscape. It\u2019s centered on the residents, whom they see as the city\u2019s assets. Most affordable-housing policy looks at rentals as temporary, like [renters are] not really citizens of the city,\u201d Howell said. In contrast, she said, TOPA \u201cgives a lot of agency and control and power to residents.\u201d\n\nIn D.C., these programs are increasingly tapped as the population has surged, adding 100,000 residents between 2000 and 2015, a 16% increase. During roughly that same time frame, rents have jumped anywhere from 14% for the lowest earners to 32% for the highest, while incomes have not grown for the two lowest quintiles, according to an analysis from the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute.\n\nIn fact, the gentrification experienced in the nation\u2019s capital in recent years has been among the most intense in the U.S., in its case resulting in the displacement of mostly African-American residents from low-income neighborhoods, according to a recent study from the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.\n\n\u201cWhile gentrification increases the value of properties in areas that suffered from prolonged disinvestment, it also results in rising rents, home and property values,\u201d the NCRC noted. \u201cAs these rising costs reduce the supply of affordable housing, existing residents, who are often black or Hispanic, are displaced. This prevents them from benefiting from the economic growth and greater availability of services that come with increased investment.\u201d\n\nEven with TOPA in place, when a D.C. landlord gets ready to sell, tenants aren\u2019t always interested in making a bid for the property. Many would rather take a buyout and vacate.\n\nYet Ramon Jacobson, who leads the city\u2019s office of the Local Initiatives Support Corp., a national community-development organization that helps fund projects like Cedar Street, often hears D.C. residents saying they \u201cwant a piece\u201d of the community. It was Jacobson and LISC that provided the developer Joseph and the Cedar Street tenants, led by Sumler, financing to match an open-market bid received by their landlord.\n\n\u201cIt used to be a big concern of ours that there would be tenants who were just interested in flipping the property,\u201d Jacobson told MarketWatch. \u201cI think people see [D.C.] as a much more desirable place to live, and want to stay as long-term residents. This is a property in a lovely neighborhood. You could easily see that someone could buy [Cedar Street], fix it up, and it could be luxury housing, and there would be no place for the residents that had been there for 30 years. We see this as a tool of equity.\u201d\n\nSee: A tax break to hasten gentrification? Housing market\u2019s Opportunity Zones may miss their target\n\nThe best of the worst solutions?\n\nLISC is the linchpin of a system so complicated that it sometimes resembles a Rube Goldberg contraption. Without all the players and all the levers, affordable housing would not be produced.\n\n\u201cCities where they\u2019ve been most successful in really moving the needle forward have some group, whether LISC, or the MacArthur Foundation in Chicago, or other local nonprofits, that are really essential to bringing a lot of people to the table and taking something difficult and figuring out how it works,\u201d said VCU\u2019s Howell.\n\nLikewise, the struggle to preserve and create affordable housing has many local characteristics but a broad outline that looks pretty similar across the country. Developers cobble together funding packages from all levels of government and attract money from private sources whenever and however possible.\n\nLISC borrows most of its money from banks that want to fulfill their obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act, a decades-old federal mandate that requires financial institutions to meet the credit needs of diverse communities.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake about it: Absent CRA, the partnerships that we have with banks would not be anything close to what they are now,\u201d said Maurice Jones, president of LISC\u2019s national organization. \u201cIt is an invaluable tool for us to get loan capital that we can deploy for projects\u201d like Cedar Street.\n\nLISC currently borrows from banks at interest rates averaging about 3.7% to 4%, Jones said, and, to a lesser extent, from \u201cimpact investors\u201d and philanthropic groups at about 2%. They lend to developers like Joseph at a rate of 3% to 6%. The spread pays for LISC\u2019s cost of doing business. (LISC also goes directly to the capital markets to raise money; it has an AA rating with a negative outlook from Standard and Poor\u2019s.)\n\nWith the Cedar Street tenants\u2019 blessing, Joseph and his partners used a loan from LISC to acquire the property. Joseph then applied to the city for permanent financing to pay back the acquisition loan and prep for reconstruction.\n\nRead: The eviction crisis is starting to look a lot like the subprime mortgage crisis\n\nIn early March 2019, one agonizing month behind schedule, Joseph and the tenants learned that the city had approved their proposal for funding. The project had been allotted $5 million earmarked to low-income-housing tax credits, which are sold to investors to raise equity capital for the project.\n\nAs of this writing, Joseph is getting ready to hire a syndicator, an agent responsible for matching interested investors to developers. Those investors \u2014 usually, but not always, banks \u2014 will bid for the right to buy those tax credits, which have a 10-year life span, meaning that every year for the next decade, those investors will see their taxes reduced by $500,000.\n\nThe city also gave Cedar Street a little over $4 million of municipal funds. And several banks have already expressed interest in granting Joseph a $2.7 million mortgage.\n\nBetween finalizing construction plans, ensuring renovations conform to historic-preservation standards for the 1920s building, putting the rest of the financing into place and pulling construction permits, work won\u2019t begin until early 2020, and is forecast to wrap up roughly a year later.\n\nIn all, it will have taken over three years and $13 million to restore 30 units of affordable housing.\n\nMany in the industry liken the process to the messiness of democracy in general: perhaps the worst way to get anything done, except that all the other approaches are even worse.\n\nIn an interview in January, Joseph mused on the complexity of the industry: \u201cEvery time I close one of these projects I take a deep breath and say there\u2019s got to be an easier way to do this, even though if it was easier, I probably wouldn\u2019t make my living doing it. It\u2019s sort of a deal with the devil \u2014 the idea that we can\u2019t produce housing with government money only; we have to get private funds into the transaction. It\u2019s created a whole business sector of people who work in and feed off this \u2026 accountants, lawyers, bankers, consultants \u2026 and the transactions themselves have umpteen documents. You say, if someone just wrote a check you could just build the housing a lot more quickly.\u201d\n\nLISC\u2019s Jones laughed when told about Joseph\u2019s ruminations.\n\n\u201cWe are putting deals together where there may be 15-plus sources of capital, so I agree wholeheartedly there\u2019s got to be a simpler way of doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the notion that the public sector is going to produce enough revenues to build all the housing that we need for everybody, the facts belie that. We\u2019ve got to find a way to get the private and the public sector in the game.\u201d\n\nPaying it forward\n\nJennifer Sumler was born in Washington, D.C., in 1968. Her father spent many years as the chauffeur and bodyguard for the president of Howard University, and her mother sandwiched her years at home taking care of the children between stints at the Federal Reserve.\n\nSumler remembers riding bikes around the neighborhood and swimming in the local pool. She also remembers the Cedar Street building full of families, and how the neighbors would congregate on the wall surrounding the building\u2019s courtyard.\n\nJennifer Sumler Jennifer Sumler and brother Calvin in front of their home on Cedar Street in 1970.\n\n\u201cWe used to all meet up after work or school and sit and talk and gossip and play a little music and catch up,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my fondest memories. I remember the gas lines of the \u201970s,\u201d as the building sits across the street from a filling station.\n\nSumler has been in Takoma longer than the Metro, the sprawling transit system that spans D.C. and its Maryland and Virginia suburbs. \u201cI remember the talk about the Metro coming and the construction. When it did open, I remember when we got off at the stop we would be the only ones. We would always laugh to ourselves getting off, \u2018It\u2019s a secret, nobody knows.\u2019 Boy, has that changed.\u201d\n\nJennifer Sumler Jennifer Sumler in front of her home in 1981.\n\nSumler attended Howard University, majoring in broadcast journalism. She\u2019s worked in television and radio news, and briefly toyed with trying to become on-air talent. But when she learned that would mean leaving Washington to work her way up in smaller news markets, she reconsidered.\n\nAfter a few decades in media, Sumler wanted a new challenge. She had been volunteering as an adult-literacy tutor and \u201cfound it rewarding in ways that I had never imagined.\u201d She went back to school and got a master\u2019s degree in education. But life happened: Her mother became sick, and Sumler put the new career on hold to care for her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of stress and a lot of work, and about 2\u00bd years ago, where I thought [my mother] was stable enough [to] let me try to get my life on track, our owner decided to sell the building,\u201d Sumler said. \u201cThat created a whole \u2019nother set of circumstances. Now we\u2019ve got to organize, a third of our population is homeless, and we\u2019re wondering about the roof.\u201d\n\nSee: This chart shows the haves and have-nots of the housing market, and it\u2019s getting worse\n\nJacobson of the local LISC is of the view that it takes a unique type of individual to execute the implausible task of organizing lower-income tenants into a quasi\u2013real estate development partnership. \u201cIn a lot of places in our society there\u2019s not a lot of venues for people to express themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have people who, if society were structured differently, they would be leaders in other ways.\u201d\n\nSumler\u2019s professional background likely gave her an advantage compared with the typical TOPA organizer. But in other ways, the Cedar Street tenant association faced a mightier challenge than most groups vying for TOPA funds: The building\u2019s post-storm disrepair had discouraged many of the tenants from the get-go. Sumler found herself in a position that\u2019s familiar to the LISC staffers but jarring to a lifelong renter with no professional experience in real estate.\n\n\u201cThe weird thing is that you are in a position to make a decision about who gets your building,\u201d she reflected in January. \u201cYou interview a bunch of developers who all have to come in and kiss the ring. It\u2019s very interesting to see who\u2019s resentful of that. TOPA is a very powerful piece of legislation, and not everyone thinks it\u2019s a good idea that the tenants get to decide who buys the building.\u201d\n\nThe tenants\u2019 attorney had prepared them well, she said. \u201cYou\u2019re making a decision based on who you think you can get along with and who respects you as tenants and who you can respect as an owner.\u201d\n\nThe neighbors found that they had converged on a simple yet profound principle: It wasn\u2019t enough for them to retain affordable rentals for themselves; they wanted to pay it forward, to make sure generations to come had the same options.\n\nRelated: We\u2019re still building the wrong kind of homes for renters\n\n\u201cThis was a very conscientious building,\u201d Sumler said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to become another property that sold out to condos and got the best offer in terms of buyouts.\u201d\n\nIn fact, 12 current tenants did decide to accept the buyout offer of $15,000, including of all those whom the storm had displaced.\n\nUltimately, Joseph\u2019s development company was \u201cthe most aligned\u201d with the tenants\u2019 desires, Sumler said. So far, it\u2019s been a respectful, collaborative process, if risky. \u201cThere were other developers that could come over in 90 days and get construction started, but their commitment to affordable housing was not in line with ours. We chose the harder path. We took the chance, and, quite frankly, we\u2019re not even sure the chance is going to pay off.\u201d\n\nRisks\n\nJoseph, 65, is far from the brash wheeler-dealer that one may associate with big-city real-estate development, but he\u2019s proven to be a genuine partner for this group of tenants striving for housing equity.\n\nGerry Joseph Affordable-housing developer Gerry Joseph in a 1998 photo in Northampton, Mass.\n\nHe began his career in Springfield, Mass., organizing low-income residents and then ran a community development corporation before moving to the nation\u2019s capital to join a nonprofit that included TOPA projects among the developments it undertook. He struck out on his own in 2010, establishing an affordable-housing consulting practice.\n\nThe Cedar Street project is only his second solo turn as a developer, and the first time he\u2019d ever applied for tax credits for a project, a reality that the Cedar Street tenants had to take into account when weighing whether to hire him. And Joseph is also, despite his background in social justice, a for-profit developer, a consideration that gave LISC pause in deciding whether to fund him.\n\nEven more pressing: LISC\u2019s financing was merely keeping the lights on in a building where maintenance had been deferred for years, where one-third of the tenants, and their rental revenues, had left. Interest on LISC\u2019s loan to Joseph cost the developer approximately $20,000 per month. With the building not fully occupied, the rent rolls covered the cost of operating the building and a sliver of that interest.\n\nJennifer Sumler Jennifer Sumler documented poor conditions and repair needs in her apartment and her building that a more responsive landlord would likely have fixed.\n\nEvery resident of Cedar Street who spoke to MarketWatch, as well as Joseph, described chronic problems in the building that a more responsive landlord would have taken care of. Sumler experienced ceiling leaks in both the bathroom and the kitchen, bubbling paint on a bedroom wall, shoddy workmanship in fixing a gas furnace and patching floor tiles, and a gas stove that received a city citation for leaks.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s sad that the city is being given away to the highest bidder. We can at least say we stood up. We want to keep this place low-to-moderate affordable for years to come.\u2019 Lillian Hanger, lifelong 410 Cedar St. resident\n\nMarketWatch reached the former landlord, Brad Gillian, and offered him the chance to comment. Without hearing specifics, Gillian responded: \u201cI don\u2019t have any response to any of that. That\u2019s a bunch of nonsense.\u201d\n\nThe building will see a significant transformation: Its plumbing, heating and electrical systems will be modernized; the portions destroyed during the storm repaired; and it will be made accessible to people with disabilities. Each individual unit, even those not damaged by the storm, will be upgraded. And perhaps most significantly, its mix of apartment configurations will change to make the building more family-friendly, as noted below.\n\nUnit size in bedrooms Current Proposed 1 19 15 2 11 14 3 0 1\n\nRent control\n\nLillian Hanger is, like Sumler, a lifelong Cedar Street resident. Hanger, 56, works on Capitol Hill and has a master\u2019s degree in public administration from Georgetown University. She\u2019s helping Sumler with the TOPA organizing after seeing firsthand the impact of gentrification on her city, as well as what she sees as the value of rent control.\n\n\u201cMy parents retired and moved away, my sister got married and moved away,\u201d Hanger said. \u201cI kind of never left. I\u2019ve had thoughts about moving, but I said, let me stick around here. My father always told me, whatever you do, don\u2019t give the apartment up. I never understood that, but now I do. He foresaw the changes coming.\u201d\n\nLillian Hanger and her sister Clare, left; her father and mother, William and Marika, right, 1966-71.\n\nHanger has withstood several attempts at being moved out, she said, and even a buyout offer by the former landlord. \u201cI was like, uh-uh, no way. They realized that they couldn\u2019t force me out. I was a good tenant, paid my rent, did what I was supposed to.\u201d\n\nEven though the TOPA pursuit has been a lot more work than she bargained for, Hanger is proud of the line the tenants drew. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that the city is being given away to the highest bidder,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can at least say we stood up. We want to keep this place low-to-moderate affordable for years to come so people can come and live in this neighborhood. It was nice to grow up here.\u201d\n\nTenant Don Mosteller, who grew up near Philadelphia and has lived in D.C. since graduating from college, took the buyout offer. He had mixed feelings about leaving Cedar Street but was living there with a girlfriend who was \u201cinsistent\u201d that they take the cash.\n\n\u201cThe long-term economic decision would be smarter to stay here for a rent that is locked in, but I don\u2019t think we saw ourselves staying here for a long time,\u201d Mosteller said. Shortly after coming to that decision, the couple broke up. Each will receive still one-half of the $15,000 buyout.\n\nMosteller mused on the torrid D.C. housing market: \u201cI\u2019m 34, I have a good job, I\u2019m a Yale graduate, I work in energy policy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut almost all of my classmates from Yale in D.C. do not own homes. There are a few people who are married, who\u2019ve managed to get a 600-square-foot condo and are paying condo fees. When the news was announced that Amazon was coming [to nearby Crystal City], most of us in the city were like, \u2018Crap, this is really bad \u2014 how could it possibly get worse?\u2019 \u201d\n\nRelated: Thanks, Amazon: Northern Virginia home sales rocket 90% in November\n\nNow, Mosteller is back out apartment hunting. He believes that living in a three-bedroom apartment with two roommates is \u201cthe monetary hack\u201d for the D.C. housing market.\n\n\u201cEveryone I know knows it: Owning a home is the way to go,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s almost nowhere left in D.C. where owning a home is reasonable. I don\u2019t want to live in a neighborhood that\u2019s incredibly far away, or be dependent on a car, or get a home that\u2019s in disrepair that I\u2019m going to have to put a lot of money into.\u201d\n\nMosteller has found the TOPA process emotionally resonant. \u201cThere are so many people who\u2019ve been displaced because people like me have moved in,\u201d he said.\n\nMosteller has been paying $1,265 a month for the one-bedroom apartment at Cedar Street. It\u2019s very hard to get accurate price data for rentals at the ZIP Code level, but a recent search on Zillow for a one-bedroom apartment in the same ZIP as 410 Cedar St. showed that the least expensive availability cost $1,466. Other options went as high as $2,500 per month.\n\nHanger and Sumler declined to reveal the monthly rents for their apartments.\n\nSee: When the rent isn\u2019t too high \u2014 but the security deposit is\n\n\u2018A challenge for black and brown communities\u2019\n\nFor all the grim statistics about D.C.\u2019s housing challenges, it\u2019s especially daunting in one important respect.\n\nAs of 2017, the most recent data available from the Census Department, black median household income in the city is about $42,000 \u2014 less than a third of the white median household income of $134,000, according to an analysis from the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute. Meanwhile, a 2016 report from the Urban Institute found that a typical white D.C. resident possessed a staggering 81 times the wealth of a black resident.\n\n\u201cWhite incomes have always been significantly higher, but it\u2019s definitely been the case that white income has bumped up as the city has changed, whereas black income has remained stagnant,\u201d the VCU professor Howell said. \u201cIn part that\u2019s because blacks who have the means to buy a home are going out to the counties. They move for the same reason we all do \u2014 schools, services, access to home ownership. They\u2019re voting with their feet.\u201d\n\nLISC staffers often encounter city residents who have few, or no, such choices. Adam Kent, who works with Jacobson at the agency\u2019s Washington office, taught for a time in the Washington public schools.\n\nHe was thoughtful for a moment when asked what drew him to the issue of housing.\n\n\u201cI saw the talent that our society was throwing away. I got into community development work because we are just forgoing so much potential in so many neighborhoods. Everybody needs a place to go home to at the end of the day. I feel like if so many of my kids had more stability, they would have been able to focus on school, focus on realizing their dreams. Having a safe, affordable and stable home is a key part of working toward the rest of your life,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Highways were driven through black communities, isolating them from investment, so what you\u2019re seeing is not something that just organically developed. It developed with the help of public policy.\u2019 Maurice Jones, Local Initiatives Support Corporation\n\nAs president of the national LISC organization, Jones takes a broader view.\n\n\u201cThis is overwhelmingly a challenge for black and brown communities throughout the country,\u201d he said. \u201cHighways were driven through black communities, isolating them from investment, so what you\u2019re seeing is not something that just organically developed. It developed with the help of public policy. We need to own that, and we need to do something about it as a country. You can\u2019t have a policy without race to correct a problem that was created by policies explicitly about race.\u201d\n\nRelated: Life happens: How people on the lower rungs of the economic ladder get help as they pursue the American Dream\n\nOne of the curiosities about 410 Cedar St., though, is how diverse the building and the neighborhood around it are.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very mixed neighborhood in terms of race, ethnicities, economic demographics \u2014 everything,\u201d longtime resident Hanger said. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where people can raise their kids, even if you\u2019re living in an apartment building. There\u2019s a great elementary school within walking distance of the apartment complex.\u201d\n\nShe remembers with a laugh how \u201chippies\u201d used to live together in large Takoma houses, until those hippies grew up and bought the houses themselves.\n\nIn communities all around the country, LISC\u2019s Jones has seen how neighborhoods were purposely cut off from areas of development, or split in two, stripping residents of resources and leaving segregation and economic hardship in its wake.\n\nThe complex at 410 Cedar St., he said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have any of that. This one is a gem.\u201d\n\nWhy not just knock it down?\n\nIt\u2019s a gem that was constructed in 1927, and that\u2019s about all that\u2019s certain about the property\u2019s origins. According to local lore, it was built as hospice housing in association with the Walter Reed Medical Center, which was located a few blocks away until it relocated a few years ago. But in response to a MarketWatch inquiry, a researcher at the U.S. Army Medical Department Museum said that pedigree is doubtful.\n\nBecause of its age and its location within the Takoma Historic District, an official designation from the National Parks Service, the property is eligible to apply for Federal Rehabilitation Tax Credits.\n\nWithin the affordable-housing category, however, the term \u201cpreservation\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily imply historic, as the designation may apply to anything other than new construction. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to just knock it down and build something new?\u201d is a question developers, government officials, consultants and investors hear often.\n\nYet as LISC\u2019s Jacobson puts it, \u201cPeople are rooted in preservation deals. Social fabric takes a long time to develop. You have to go through some snowstorms and people going out to shovel at the same time, someone bringing an infant home. With new housing projects, we just count up the units and the numbers and forget that there\u2019s a community that has to be built.\u201d\n\nWhile the notion of social fabric sounds poetic, as VCU\u2019s Howell likes to point out, it also makes preservation deals \u201ca lot messier\u201d than new construction.\n\nAnd the clock is ticking. The types of financing incentives that the developer Joseph is using to fund his project, and which developers use to build new affordable homes, have expiration dates. A 2015 mayoral task force determined that nearly 14,000 units of affordable housing with such subsidies are \u201cat risk of loss\u201d by 2020 in Washington.\n\nRead: Meet the little bank that\u2019s helping immigrants achieve big American Dreams\n\nCounterintuitively, the complexity of the affordable-housing funding process may be what keeps it going.\n\nA cynical view is that the thousands of people who have a hand in projects like 410 Cedar St. now represent an entrenched constituency for this way of doing business. A more generous take is that the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit has actually become the Holy Grail of public policy: a bipartisan solution that can be leveraged for far bigger impact than the amount of money it requires.\n\n\u201cLIHTC has rehabilitated the reputation of public policy for affordable housing,\u201d Buzz Roberts, the CEO of the industry group the National Association of Affordable Housing Lenders, told MarketWatch.\n\nIn 1986, when a housing tax credit was being considered as part of the massive tax-reform effort then underway, \u201cthere were a lot of skeptics that anyone could manage affordable rental housing effectively,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThere had been all these previous government projects that were poorly managed, poorly located, beset with crime and other social problems.\u201d\n\nBy involving private investors, the LIHTC program established a sense of market stability that helped convince banks to enter the space, too.\n\nThat private-sector involvement \u2014 along with the fact that LIHTC is a tax expenditure, not a direct spending program \u2014 has also kept Republicans, who might not ordinarily support public funding for affordable housing, on board, and has helped LIHTC survive party-rule changes over three decades.\n\nSee: They help thousands of Americans become homeowners every year. Now they face a test of their own.\n\nOnward\n\nIn April, after the city approved the funding that enabled the Cedar Street project to move forward, everyone involved breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nLISC\u2019s Jacobson and Kent had faced an extra layer of scrutiny from their national colleagues over the risk associated with the Cedar Street project: the building\u2019s disrepair, the uncertainty of city financing, Joseph\u2019s comparative lack of relevant experience and, no small matter, rising interest rates. In February, LISC was handed a downgraded outlook by the credit-rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s, which cited a growing debt burden.\n\nThat made the city\u2019s financial boost extremely timely. LISC will get back the money it lent to Joseph relatively quickly, which means that the repaid money can be recycled into another project.\n\nJoseph faces his own version of that dilemma. \u201cThe thing about this kind of work is that it\u2019s all money out for a long period of time, until we get a return,\u201d he said. He got an unpleasant reminder of that \u2014 and of the complex\u2019s recent history of deferred maintenance \u2014 in March. One apartment had a leak severe enough that he temporarily relocated the tenants until the problem was patched, costing time, energy, and about $1,000.\n\nRelated: Blacks make up 13% of the population but only got 6% of the mortgages last year\n\nThe Cedar Street project has what Joseph calls \u201ca double bottom line\u201d: one that pays the bills but also feeds the soul of someone who originally got into housing as a way of affecting social change.\n\n\u201cI believe that the economic forces that are creating displacement in these hot markets will continue. But I also believe that what you\u2019re seeing now is more people in the public and private sectors who are willing to actually get into the game,\u201d LISC\u2019s Jones said in March. \u201cI think that there is the possibility here for us to get more laborers in the vineyard and thus do this work on a bigger scale.\u201d\n\nJennifer Sumler had never expected to be called to any kind of cause. She just wanted to save her home, even as the ground under her feet has continued shifting.\n\n\u201cI love the neighborhood and the location and the history here,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it is going through a transformation right now. It\u2019s just a little scary right now in terms of seeing how this all shakes out. What we will be able to maintain and what we will lose is the scariest part of all.\u201d", "description": "As gentrification sweeps through many U.S. cities, including Washington D.C., more residents have trouble finding affordable housing.
