They are caught in the same status traps as everyone else, even if they react self-consciously.\u201d\n\nWhat is true for class also goes for race, gender, age and a range of other affiliations: the American left are the products of the very society they are trying to change. As Trump has targeted women, black people, Latinos, Muslims and immigrants \u2013 to name but a few \u2013 so those groups have rallied and are asserting themselves while others, within the progressive coalition, have become more sensitized to their condition.\n\nWhen they look to a party, and indeed a candidate, they want to see someone who will challenge the reactionary rhetoric and policies that have come from the White House. This forces conversations and, at time, confrontations that have always been present on the left, but rarely quite so acute.\n\nThis has already become evident among presidential contenders in early primary clashes whether it be over Joe Biden\u2019s intrusively tactile manner and history of opposing bussing, Pete Buttigeig\u2019s mishandling of the police shooting of a black man in his home town or Bernie Sanders inability to sufficiently appeal to African Americans in 2016. There were roughly as many black and Latina women who voted Democrat in 2016 as there were white men, although you wouldn\u2019t know that to hear the commentary or look at the candidates.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Serenity Usman, 15, attends a campaign event for presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren in Seattle.

But we are central. Our demands. Our presence. Our voice. They can\u2019t win without us. And we get worn out having to keep on explaining that to them.\u201d\n\nThese ideological and strategic cleavages are not, as some suggest, simply a product of \u2018identity politics\u2019. They are, to some extent, embedded in material differences that come with being black or poor or female in America.\n\nAt a recent orientation for one Chicago-based progressive group new members related their experiences of the financial crash. The black participants shared stories about losing their jobs and homes and moving back in with their parents. The white ones talked about mounting college debt, graduating from college unable to find a job and moving in with their parents.\n\nThese differences in experience can have a significant political impact. \u201cThere were women with a certain degree of comfort and privilege who see this as a new kind of crisis,\u201d explains Lara Putnam, a professor at the university of Pittsburgh. \u201cBut there are also people who are in more vulnerable and marginalized positions who didn\u2019t. For them this was a logical step change that they were familiar with, but hit them more broadly. In places where there\u2019s an overlap between those two groups there was a real clash of experiences that lead to some really high-profile mistakes being made.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A woman attends the Women\u2019s March in New York in 2018.

In a very segregated city with an almost even split among black, Latino and white, the socialist victories in Chicago came in a range of places, including predominantly black, Latino and white wards as well as a couple that were relatively mixed.\n\n\u201cThe American political project is based upon white supremacy and dividing us so that they can fleece us,\u201d explains Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, a socialist alderman in Chicago. \u201cSo the moments when the left has been the most powerful have been when it has been able to transcend those divisions imposed on us \u2026 The Chicago DSA branch is overwhelmingly white,\u201d he concedes. \u201cBut if you look at the leadership, it\u2019s overwhelmingly people of color. And if you look towards the work we\u2019re doing it\u2019s very intentionally geared towards issues that directly impact people of color and where the solution or the movement is led by people of color.\u201d\n\nJeanette Taylor, the only African American Chicago city council member to be elected with Democratic Socialist of America\u2019s endorsement, believes white people on the left still have some way to go.\n\n\u201cDSA has done some good work,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have enough people of color.\n\n\u201cThey asked me: \u2018How could you work with DSA?\u2019 And I said, \u2018I\u2019m tired of people who advocate for me and my voice is not at the table.\u2019 We don\u2019t need any more spokespeople. We need people to walk with us.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Supporters attend a campaign event for Bernie Sanders in Chicago in March.

But other than a few people that didn\u2019t happen. So what did DSA really do to help me get in office? They didn\u2019t do that much. That\u2019s just the truth. But I don\u2019t take away from the work they\u2019re trying to do. My issue with them is: they had a meeting. We all came. There were two black people there. Me and my chief of staff. But you want to work on black issues. You want to work with us. You got to have black people at the door. Otherwise you\u2019re no different from any of those groups who claim you\u2019re for the people.\u201d\n\nAs embattled as she sounds Taylor is the most confident person I met about the future.\n\n\u201cI think Trump is going to be a one-term president,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to win at all. Unless, the Democratic party fucks up and gets this nomination wrong. Which they could.\u201d\n\nAt which point Taylor paused and laughed to herself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because they call it the United States but it\u2019s as broken as hell.\u201d", "description": "Marginalized groups in America are asserting themselves and, in doing so, making others sensitized to their condition", "authors": ["Gary Younge"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0943c374fa1fe45324db7e5866ac227a3d14197/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ba48c70cd96a99329e8378503e0d6a1", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
