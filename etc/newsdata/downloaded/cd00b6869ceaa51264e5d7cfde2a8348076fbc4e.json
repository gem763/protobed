Joseph took charge of the Cherry Blossoms in 2016, having most recently led the side to victory at the Pacific Nations Cup.\n\nKey player\n\nMichael Leitch: The New Zealand-born full-back returned from injury in time for selection and leads the side for a second successive World Cup. Leitch, who became a Japanese citizen in 2013 after moving to Sapporo aged 15, possesses all the required skills of a modern openside flanker. In particular, his ability to force turnovers will prove invaluable \u2013 as will his all-round experience on the international stage.\n\nPast record\n\nJapan have yet to progress beyond the group stages of the World Cup, coming agonisingly close at the 2015 edition.\n\nPrediction\n\nJapan know how to spring a surprise, as their win over South Africa four years ago shows. Take into account the backing they\u2019ll receive as the hosts, there\u2019s every reason to believe this could be the tournament in which they finally reach the knockout stages. I\u2019m predicting a second-place finish in the group stages and a quarter-final berth for the side.\n\nFixtures\n\nFriday 20 September \u2013 Japan vs Russia (Tokyo), 11:45am BST\n\nSaturday 28 September \u2013 Japan vs Ireland (Shizuoka), 8:15am\n\nFriday 5 October \u2013 Japan vs Samoa (Toyota), 11:30am\n\nSunday 13 October \u2013 Japan vs Scotland (Yokohama), 11:45am\n\nOdds\n\nJapan to win the World Cup: 150/1", "description": "As hosts, there\u2019s an expectation that Japan\u00a0will finally go one better than their previous eight campaigns at the Rugby World Cup and reach the quarter-finals of the tournament.
