(Dan Hamilton/USA Today Sports)\n\nA pair of Philadelphia 76ers fans said they were escorted out of Tuesday evening\u2019s game after they expressed support for the pro-democracy protests underway in Hong Kong.\n\nSam Wachs, 33, claims security ejected him and his wife from Wells Fargo Center after they held up signs reading \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d and shouted the same slogan at the Sixers\u2019 exhibition game against Guangzhou Loong Lions, a Chinese Basketball Association team.\n\nWachs, who lived in Hong Kong before moving to Philadelphia, was seated directly behind the Guangzhou bench and was also sporting a \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d T-shirt. He said security first informed him, \u201cno politics\u201d and later confiscated his signs. He was finally ejected from the game later when he stood up and yelled \u201cFree Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u201cSigns must be in good taste and appropriate for the event,\u201d reads Wells Fargo Center\u2019s policy, but adds that the \u201cpolicy is subject to change based on the Wells Fargo Center management\u2019s discretion and without notice.\u201d\n\nThe incident comes as the NBA continues to weather criticism for apologizing to China over a tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey expressing support for the Hong Kong demonstrators. Morey tweeted and deleted a logo with the phrase, \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe expression of support angered Chinese sponsors of the NBA, some of whom pulled their sponsorships. The NBA then released an apologetic statement distancing itself from Morey\u2019s tweet, saying the Rockets general manager \u201cdoes not represent the Rockets or the NBA,\u201d a move that sparked severe criticism in the U.S.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver attempted to appease both sides Tuesday, saying that Morey enjoys the right to free speech as an NBA employee but that \u201cthere are consequences from his freedom of speech and we will have to live with those consequences.\u201d", "description": "A pair of Philadelphia 76ers fans said they were escorted out of Tuesday's game after they expressed support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "Kevin D.
