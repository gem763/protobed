USA TODAY\n\nWhen NBA Commissioner Adam Silver went to the podium in Tokyo on Tuesday to answer questions about the international crisis his league has found itself in the middle of, he had already made an important choice.\n\nInstead of continuing acquiescence to Chinese political sensitivities that were stirred over a since-deleted tweet from Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey in support of protests in Hong Kong, Silver put his league\u2019s highly lucrative relationship with a country of 1.4 billion potential customers on the block and all but told China to deal with it.\n\n\u201cThe long-held values of the NBA are to support freedom of expression and certainly freedom of expression by members of the NBA community, and in this case, Daryl Morey as the general manager of the Houston Rockets enjoys that right as one of our employees,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWhat I also tried to suggest is I understand there are consequences from that exercise of, in essence, his freedom of speech and we'll have to live with those consequences. It\u2019s our hope that for our Chinese fans and our partners in China they\u2019ll see those remarks in the context of now a three-decade if not longer relationship.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know at this stage whether Silver changed course as a result of the backlash to the NBA\u2019s initial squishiness or whether he had come to the realization over the course of the previous 24 hours that no amount of groveling was going to satisfy the interests that have complete control over how much or how little the league\u2019s product is distributed in China.\n\nEither way, this much is clear: If the red line for China\u2019s relationship with the NBA is this easily crossed \u2014 we\u2019re talking about one comment by one league employee on a web site that is blocked on China\u2019s Internet to begin with \u2014 how can you expect that relationship to last in the first place?\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver speaks at a news conference before an NBA preseason basketball game between the Houston Rockets and the Toronto Raptors Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2019, in Saitama, near Tokyo.

Nation pulls plug on airing games\n\nWARRIORS: Scottie Pippen's 6-foot-10 nephew is signed to bulk up frontcourt\n\nThough there\u2019s certainly an argument to be made that the NBA has a social responsibility as an American cultural institution to stand up for free speech as well as the fragile rights of millions of Hong Kongers \u2014 many of whom also watch the NBA \u2014 you don\u2019t really need to even delve into the politics to see why it\u2019s critical for the NBA to draw its own line in the sand, even if it puts the Chinese market in jeopardy.\n\nThe NBA isn\u2019t the first American entity to bend itself into ethical knots to keep China happy. But unlike an airline or a tech company with anonymous employees who do their jobs and go home, the NBA is uniquely situated in that its employees are public promoters with huge platforms who answer questions every day about all kinds of things.\n\nThough Morey\u2019s tweet was certainly a self-inflicted situation, something like this was bound to happen. And if one tweet that isn\u2019t even controversial to an American audience is enough to provoke the Chinese into suspending television deals and various business arrangements with the Houston Rockets, it\u2019s truly worth wondering whether the NBA can really operate in that kind of environment without walking on political eggshells every time it sends a team over there for a game.\n\nThough there will be a lot of bad-faith criticism of the NBA for being hypocritical from people who don't like the league\u2019s \u201cwokeness,\u201d the reality is that these kinds of uncomfortable arrangements are going to come with the territory of global expansion. And it's not just China.\n\nThe NBA is currently partnering with FIBA to build a professional basketball league in Africa, which makes perfect sense for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that a country like Nigeria is projected to have a population of 400 million by 2050.\n\n\u201cI think ultimately it\u2019s because of (the) transformational nature of digital media where in Africa, a continent of over a billion people, where there are something like 700 million cell phones, 400 million of which are smart phones,\u201d Silver said at this year's NBA Finals. \u201cSo we see enormous growth opportunities both in terms of players and for participation and ultimately an interest for the league.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, though, Nigeria is a country where media are heavily censored by the government. It\u2019s also a country where, for instance, LGBT people have practically no rights and can be imprisoned or executed. In a league where the commissioner and numerous players march in gay pride parades every year, you have to ask whether the NBA can really manage to be one thing here at home and something else to the rest of the world.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not an easy call because the NBA is the only American sports league that is positioned to make an impact on every single continent, and the financial implications of that pursuit are very real. But the compromises are, too, and Silver's news conference was at least some indication that the NBA does have a breaking point.\n\nIt may no longer be up to Silver what that means for doing business in China, but at least the NBA understands it can\u2019t bend any further.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Dan Wolken on Twitter @DanWolken", "description": "The NBA is the only American sports league positioned to make an impact on every continent, and the financial implications of that are very real.", "authors": ["Dan Wolken", "Published P.M.
