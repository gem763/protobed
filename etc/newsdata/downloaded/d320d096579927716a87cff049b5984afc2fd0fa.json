His last filing to the ASX showed he had an interest in 1.62 million shares and performance rights, worth a combined $31 million on paper.\n\nTreasury Wines has been a sharemarket darling since Mr Clarke took over in early 2014, with the share price having risen almost fivefold to around $19 as the company repositioned Penfolds as a luxury brand and sales and profits to China boomed.\n\nHigh targets\n\nTreasury shares gained 3.8 per cent on Wednesday as the company revealed solid trading in the September quarter and reaffirmed full-year profit forecasts that it would deliver earnings growth of between 15 to 20 per cent in 2019-2020.\n\nMr Clarke said he was ''pleased'' with the first-quarter trading of Treasury, but didn't give any more detail.\n\nTreasury held its annual meeting in San Francisco, where Mr Clarke and chairman Paul Rayner took a handful of questions via a web link from Melbourne, where local shareholders gathered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Rayner said there were high targets in place for Mr Clarke, and all shareholders had benefited from the company's strong performance over the past few years.\n\n\"We do set very stretching targets,'' he said.\n\nHigh multiples\n\nMr Rayner fielded questions from shareholder activist Stephen Mayne in Melbourne, and conceded there had been too much turnover in chief financial officers at the company in the past six years.\n\n\"We've probably had too many CFOs in a short time,'' Mr Rayner said. But he said there were reasons for the turnover including retirements and geographic relocations. Treasury Wine has had five chief financial officers since 2013 in Mark Fleming, Tony Reeves, Noel Meehan, Gunther Burghardt and now Matt Young.\n\nTreasury on September 9 revealed Mr Clarke had sold 34,012 shares in another round of share selling, albeit substantially smaller than previous occasions. On August 19 it announced he had offloaded another big parcel, reaping $3.6 million to help meet tax obligations.\n\nIn early May, Mr Clarke offloaded almost $7 million in shares at $17.22 and $17.25 when the stock was trading near a seven-month high. The May sale came amid a broader sharemarket downturn and at a time analysts and hedge fund managers were questioning the high multiples the company trades on.\n\nHe sold $5.7 million of shares in August 2018.", "description": "The boss of Treasury Wines says Australia is a high taxing country and he sold $17m of shares in 15 months mainly to cover tax bills.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_655%2C$y_80/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8dfff8daf9f4f21fbcfa7a6c024b15f2780642b6", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
