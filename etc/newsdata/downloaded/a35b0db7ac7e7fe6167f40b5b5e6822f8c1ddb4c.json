And I knew that if we're gonna fail the task I'm going to be going home.\n\n'I was actually grateful and relieved. I know how this process work before I came in. I'm not arrogant enough to think ''oh I'm gonna not gonna get fired.'' There are 16 candidates, 15 of them are going to get fired. So I was one of them and this was my time to go.\n\n'I'm grateful because I looked like a right t**t for the last four weeks, I'm sure I would have messed up and done something stupid.\n\nHmm: And in an exclusive interview with MailOnline, the finance manager, 33, has admitted that she was 'relieved' to be sacked by Lord Sugar after she 'acted like a t**t.\n\n'I can just relax now and laugh at other people, although I was quiet I still managed to look like a t**t so I'm happy I got fired when I did.'\n\nThe task saw the candidates design and attempt to sell an electric bike, with Thomas put into the position of Project Manager (PM).\n\nLubna was honest from the beginning that she knew very little about bikes, and so focused on the sales aspect when the bikes were put to retailers.\n\nBut this backfired when Lord Sugar insisted that she did not offer enough contribution to the team, and was duly fired from the show.\n\nGoing wrong: The task saw the candidates design and attempt to sell an electric bike, with Thomas put into the position of Project Manager (PM)\n\nHonest: Lubna was honest from the beginning that she knew very little about bikes, and so focused on the sales aspect when the bikes were put to retailers\n\nShe also admitted that her platform of 'honesty and integrity' was used against her during the process to highlight her lack of knowledge during the task.\n\n'I definitely wasn't the reason for the failure of the task, I didn't design the task, and I never said I'm an amazing salesperson,' she exclusively told MailOnline.\n\n'This wasn't my strength, I don't know anything about bikes, I've never learned how to ride a bike..\n\n'I'm not good at blagging and pretending that I know everything when I don't. I said in my audition I'm very honest, and so I was very honest about the fact that I don't know anything about bikes and that was used against me.'\n\n'The only thing I couldn't contribute is throwing people under the bus and shouting and raising my voice, that's the only thing viewers didn't see.'\n\nNo way: She also admitted that her platform of 'honesty and integrity' was used against her during the process to highlight her lack of knowledge during the task\n\nLubna also admitted that she feels her decision to play down her contributions during the process made her somewhat fall into the background when compared to other candidates who could, in her words, 'talk the talk and walk the walk.'\n\nShe went onto say that while Thomas did take responsibility for failing the task as PM, he failed to acknowledge a moment of sabotage that was not aired on-screen.\n\n'I was given one opportunity to make a sale. One from Thomas,' Lubna explained.\n\n'He sabotaged that sale and that part wasn't shown. And Scarlett was given the opportunities to make sales and she didn't make a sale either so she should've been in the boardroom.'\n\n'[Thomas] is not someone who takes responsibility, I'd say he did take responsibility as project manager. He just made the wrong decisions.'\n\nFinal moments: She went onto say that while Thomas did take responsibility for failing the task as PM, he failed to acknowledge a moment of sabotage that was not aired on-screen\n\nBoardroom: Lubna ended up in the final boardroom with Thomas and Marianne Rawlins\n\n'I would say if we base this failure on who is the reason I would say Thomas would be a big reason because he made the wrong decisions as PM.\n\n'But if we look at it from the perspective that it is a TV show I'd say Mary-Anne and Thomas are much more fun to watch. I'm not going to do anything unprofessional or crazy just to be in the limelight.\n\n'If you look at my background and the way I behaved in the process was quite professional. From that point of view I would have been a great business partner for Lord Sugar, but I didn't come across or get that across to him that well.'\n\nBut in a surprise change in view Lubna went onto say that Thomas is her pick to win the show.\n\nU-turn: She said: 'Who I'd like to do well is Thomas, he's very passionate I think he's a gentleman and a great personality to watch on-screen so I wish him well and hope he does well in the process\n\nShe said: 'Who I'd like to do well is Thomas, he's very passionate I think he's a gentleman and a great personality to watch on-screen so I wish him well and hope he does well in the process.\n\n'All of them are capable in some ways. Everyone has a different personality they bring a different skill set and they all do well and flourish in a different task and situation.\n\n'Had I become PM I would have come across really well and strong but I didn't get a chance. There's lots of strong candidates this year but it depends on what Lord Sugar is looking for.'\n\nRespect: Lubna added that she hoped to tell Lord Sugar more about her respect for him, but held back during the process to avoid being seen as 'grovelling'\n\nRegarding her plans after leaving the boardroom, Lubna explained that she's currently working on a business that offers tailored business services, and alongside her full time job as a finance manager and mother, she is hoping to publish a book in the coming months.\n\nLubna added that she hoped to tell Lord Sugar more about her respect for him, but held back during the process to avoid being seen as 'grovelling.'\n\nShe added: 'It's a very tough process mentally and physically as well ,I'm grateful I got a chance to be on but you have to have your heart fully in the process and if you're only there 990% of the time that's not enough to do well in the process.\n\n'I'm a mother I'm not a fame-seeking teenager, I've never been greedy in my life I've been fortunate I've worked hard and good things have happened to me, but my heart and mind wasn't there.'\n\nThe Apprentice continues on Wednesday at 9pm on BBC One.", "description": "In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, the finance manager, 33, has admitted that she was 'relieved' to be sacked by Lord Sugar as she 'acted like a t**t during the process.'", "authors": ["Laura Fox For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/22/20104560-0-image-a-42_1571866389902.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
