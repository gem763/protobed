None of the three had won on the PGA Tour. Hubbard lost the lead with a bogey on the par-5 16th, while Harrington's big rally ended with a three-putt bogey on the 17th.\n\nGriffin's birdie on the 16th was his first since the eighth hole. On the 18th hole, he played it away from the water and into the right rough and hit his approach to 60 feet. His birdie putt ran 6 feet by the hole, and he dropped his putter and raised both arms when it dropped for the win.\n\nHe finished at 14-under 274 and earned a two-year exemption, along with trips to the Masters and PGA Championship.\n\nEUROPEAN TOUR\n\nROME (AP) \u2014 Bernd Wiesberger closed with a 6-under 65 to win the Italian Open and move atop the Race to Dubai standings on the European Tour.\n\nWiesberger rallied from three shots behind Matt Fitzpatrick at Olgiata Golf Club. Fitzpatrick had chances to force a playoff but narrowly missed an eagle putt on the 17th and a birdie putt on the 18th hole. He shot a 69.\n\nWiesberger, who finished at 16-under 268, won for the third time this year on the European Tour following victories at Made in Denmark and the Scottish Open. He now has two victories this year in the Rolex Series.\n\nWiesberger has 4,198 points in the Race to Dubai, ahead of Jon Ram (3,898), British Open champion Shane Lowry (3,535) and Fitzpatrick (2,865).\n\nPGA TOUR CHAMPIONS\n\nCARY, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Jerry Kelly closed with a 7-under 65 and won the SAS Championship on Sunday, allowing him to close the gap in the Charles Schwab Cup as the PGA Tour Champions heads into its postseason.\n\nKelly ran off five straight birdies on the front nine at Prestonwood Country Club to take control. Two birdies late in the final round gave him some breathing room, and he closed with a bogey for a one-shot victory over David McKenzie, who shot 63.\n\nWoody Austin and Doug Barron, who shared the lead going into the final round, each shot 71 and tied for third with David Toms (66).\n\nKelly moved to within $221,430 of Scott McCarron in the Schwab Cup. Points are double in the three playoff events.\n\nOTHER TOURS\n\nJin Young Ko, the No. 1 player in women's golf, returned home and won the Hite Jinro Championship on the Korean LPGA by closing with a 72 for a one-shot victory. ...
