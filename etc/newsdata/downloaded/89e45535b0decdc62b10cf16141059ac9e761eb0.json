People reported that Cardi B is talking candidly about her experience with sexual assault and the #MeToo movement on Untold Stories of Hip Hop set to air Thursday, September 26, on WE TV.\n\nIn the clip from People, Cardi opens up to host Angie Martinez about the time she was sexually assaulted while on the set of a magazine shoot. \u201cI will never forget how I went to shoot for this magazine and the photographer, he was trying to get close to me like, \u2018Yeah, you want to get in this magazine?\u2019 Then he pulled his dick out.\u201d Never one to mince words, Cardi tells a visibly shocked Martinez exactly how she felt about the situation. \u201cI was so fucking mad,\u201d she says, \u201cand I was just like, \u2018This is crazy.\u2019\u201d\n\nCardi ultimately left the shoot because of the incident. \u201cI was like, [You\u2019re] fucking bugging. You know what? I\u2019m out!\u201d In the interview, Cardi goes on to describe how that experience shaped her relationship with the #MeToo movement and how pervasive sexual assault is in the music industry. \u201cWhen I see the #MeToo movement \u2014 there\u2019s girls from the hood I know that went through the same type of treatment, like they make you feel like you got to do a certain type of thing for the most bullshit shit. It happens, really, every day.\u201d\n\nIf you were worried that Bartier Cardi still has to deal with stuff like this on a regular basis, you can rest easy. Cardi B made it exceedingly clear that she still has a zero-tolerance policy for that kind of behavior. When Martinez asked if she faces that same type of harassment today, Cardi said, \u201cOh, hell no. I\u2019ll put you on blast on my Instagram \u2026 I\u2019ll fucking violate.\u201d So just to be clear: Lil\u2019 bitch, you can\u2019t fuck with Cardi if you wanted to, Okurr?", "description": "In an interview airing on WE tv, Cardi B reveals she was once sexually assaulted while on the set of a magazine shoot.", "authors": ["Chris Murphy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/25-cardi-b.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
