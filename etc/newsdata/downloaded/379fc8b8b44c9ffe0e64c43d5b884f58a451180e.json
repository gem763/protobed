Messing claimed she apologized for liking the sign but doubled down on her criticism of the president.\n\n\"NUMBER 1\u2013 I apologized for liking that church sign. I said I regret it. I shud have thought before recklessly supporting,\" she tweeted.\n\n'WILL & GRACE' STAR CELEBRATES SIGN CALLING BLACK TRUMP VOTERS MENTALLY ILL\n\nShe said she supported that sign because of alleged racism on the part of Trump and the Republican Party. \"You won\u2019t accept this but black people are targeted by Trump\u2019s GOP for voter suppression,\" she said.\n\nShe added that \"Charlottesville was about Trump supporters hating POC and Jews\" -- a reference to the protests in 2017 where white supremacists demonstrated in opposition to removing a statue of former Civil War General Robert E. Lee. James Fields plowed into protesters at a white supremacist rally, killing 32-year-old paralegal Heather Heyer and injuring more than 30 others.\n\nERIC MCCORMACK BACKTRACKS, SAYS HE DOESN'T SUPPORT 'BLACKLISTS' AFTER CALLING TO OUT TRUMP DONORS\n\nMessing and \"Will & Grace\" co-star Eric McCormack ignited a media firestorm in recent days when they called for a media outlet to publish the names of people attending a fundraiser for President Trump.\n\nAmid backlash, the two claimed they weren't calling for a blacklist but rather wanted to bring attention to already-public information.\n\n\"I NEVER NOR WOULD I EVER call for a blacklist of anyone for any reason. The info is publicly available. I as a consumer want to know where MY ... Money is going when I pay for entertainment. Just as you have the right to not watch W&G bc I don\u2019t support Trump, I have the right to not go see (pay for) a movie with someone supporting babies in cages,\" the actress said in two separate tweets on Wednesday.\n\nWHOOPI GOLDBERG DISAGREES WITH DEBRA MESSING OVER TRUMP 'BLACKLIST': 'PEOPLE CAN VOTE FOR WHO THEY WANT TO'\n\nMessing also cited the First Amendment, adding that \"there is nothing threatening about asking politely for information.\"\n\nHer initial comments caught widespread attention -- including a condemnation from \"View\" host Whoopi Goldberg -- and a slight from the president himself.\n\n\"I have not forgotten that when it was announced that I was going to do The Apprentice, and when it then became a big hit, helping NBC\u2019s failed lineup greatly, @DebraMessing came up to me at an Upfront & profusely thanked me, even calling me 'Sir.' How times have changed!\" he tweeted on Saturday.", "description": "Actress Debra Messing, on Wednesday, attempted to explain why she promoted an Alabama church sign that called black Trump voters mentally ill.", "authors": ["Sam Dorman", "Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News.
