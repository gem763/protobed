Katie Hill talks about public trust in government's highest-ranked leaders. Tom Kisken, tkisken@vcstar.com, 805-437-0255\n\nFreshman Rep. Katie Hill, D-Calif., faced with allegations she had a sexual relationship with a staff member, announced her resignation on Sunday.\n\nIn a statement posted to Twitter, Hill called her resignation \"the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country.\"\n\nThe House Ethics Committee announced Wednesday it had launched an investigation into allegations Hill engaged in a sexual relationship with a staff member. Hill said claims that she was in a relationship with her legislative director are \"absolutely false.\"\n\n\"This is what needs to happen so that the good people who supported me will no longer be subjected to the pain inflected by my abusive husband and the brutality of hateful political operatives who seem to happily provide a platform to a monster who is driving a smear campaign built around cyber exploitation,\" Hill said in her Sunday statement.\n\nIt is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress. This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country.\n\n\n\nSee my official statement below. pic.twitter.com/nG97RQIwvO \u2014 Rep. Katie Hill (@RepKatieHill) October 27, 2019\n\nHill and her husband are going through a divorce.\n\nThe allegation of Hill's relationship with one of her staffers was first published by conservative website RedState.com. The site also posted a nude photo purportedly of Hill with another person, along with a second allegation that Hill had a relationship with an unidentified campaign staffer.\n\nHill acknowledged the relationship with the campaign staffer, who is not on her congressional staff, in her letter Wednesday and apologized, saying the relationship happened \"despite my better judgment.\"\n\nAllegations: House committee opens investigation into allegations Rep. Katie Hill had relationship with staffer\n\n\"The Committee notes that the mere fact that it is investigating these allegations, and publicly disclosing its review, does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred, or reflect any judgment on behalf of the Committee,\" Chairman Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., and Ranking Member Rep. Kenny Marchant, R-Texas, said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nIn a Tuesday statement, Hill also said she contacted police after a nude photo of her was published online. She reiterated that statement on Sunday and she said is \"pursuing all of our available legal options.\"\n\n\"However, I know that as long as I am in Congress, we'll live fearful of what might come next and how much it will hurt,\" Hill said in her statement.\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci, USA TODAY\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/27/katie-hill-california-congresswoman-resigns-amid-ethics-probe/2481703001/", "description": "Democratic California Rep.
