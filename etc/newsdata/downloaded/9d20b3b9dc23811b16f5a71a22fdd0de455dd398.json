Now, he\u2019s running for Rep. Katie Hill\u2019s seat.", "language": "en", "text": "His seat of choice? The one occupied by Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.), who announced Sunday that she is resigning amid an ethics investigation into allegations that she had been romantically involved with her legislative director. Hill has denied the charge, but admitted to engaging in a consensual three-person relationship with her now-estranged husband and a member of her campaign staff. The freshman lawmaker, who identifies as bisexual, became embroiled in controversy earlier this month after a conservative news site and British tabloid published nude photos of Hill without her consent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Tuesday, Papadopoulos, 32, filed paperwork to run as a Republican in California\u2019s 25th District and is expected to formally announce his candidacy later this week, Fox News reported. The news was met with swift backlash from California State Assemblywoman Christy Smith, who is so far the lone Democrat in the race for Hill\u2019s seat. Three Republicans are also running, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\u201cIf he pled guilty to lying to the FBI \u2014 how do we know he\u2019ll tell us the truth?\u201d Smith tweeted, tagging Papadopoulos. \u201cWe deserve someone from our community serving as our voice \u2014 not @realDonaldTrump\u2019s wannabe political hack!\u201d\n\nSmith later ratcheted up her criticism of Papadopoulos, sharing a video that appeared to mock the former Trump adviser over the short amount of time he\u2019s lived in California. Papadopoulos, who is originally from Illinois, moved west with his wife after he was sentenced in September 2018.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHey, guess what, this is California,\u201d Smith said in Tuesday\u2019s video, slapping her hand on a map of the United States. \u201cAnd as soon as you can identify my district on here, you let us know.\u201d\n\nPapadopoulos did not respond to requests for comment late Tuesday, but has repeatedly mentioned Hill\u2019s congressional seat in recent tweets.\n\nOne day before the photos of Hill were published, Papadopoulos tweeted, \u201cCalifornia\u2019s 25th congressional district looks like it\u2019s for the taking.\u201d\n\nIn another post after the photos came out, Papadopoulos slammed Hill as an \u201cembarrassment to the great people in that district.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone has to step up,\u201d he tweeted Sunday, following Hill\u2019s announcement. \u201cI love my state too much to see it run down by candidates like Hill. All talk, no action, and a bunch of sell outs.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nI\u2019m smelling blood in the water now that Katie Hill has resigned. California\u2019s 25th congressional district is wide open for the taking. Someone has to step up. I love my state too much to see it run down by candidates like Hill. All talk, no action, and a bunch of sell outs. \u2014 George Papadopoulos (@GeorgePapa19) October 27, 2019\n\nPapadopoulos\u2019s political career began in 2015, not long after Trump came down the escalator at Trump Tower, T.A. Frank wrote in a profile published this year in The Washington Post Magazine. His initial attempt to join the Trump campaign didn\u2019t pan out and he ended up briefly serving as an adviser for then-presidential candidate Ben Carson, before taking a job with the London Center of International Law Practice. But Papadopoulos never gave up on his goal of working for Trump\u2019s campaign, and eventually came on as a foreign policy adviser in March 2016, Frank reported.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an oil and energy consultant,\u201d Trump said of Papadopoulos a few months later, according to The Post. \u201cExcellent guy.\u201d\n\nWithin days of starting his new role, Papadopoulos, guided by the campaign\u2019s interest in improving relations with Moscow, was already working to get Trump a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Frank reported. Papadopoulos\u2019s efforts led him to a London-based professor, who told him that the Russians had access to \u201cdirt\u201d on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, namely damaging emails. Papadopoulos stayed in contact with the professor and later communicated with Russian nationals, including a woman he incorrectly believed was Putin\u2019s niece, The Post reported.\n\nAD\n\nThen, in May 2016, the situation took a turn.\n\nThat\u2019s when Papadopoulos made an offhand remark about the Russians and their \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton to an Australian diplomat over drinks at a bar in London, according to The Post. This conversation between Papadopoulos and the diplomat, who promptly relayed the information to American officials, helped trigger the FBI investigation of Trump\u2019s campaign in late July 2016.\n\nAD\n\nAbout a year later, Papadopoulos was arrested at Washington Dulles International Airport \u2014 accused of making false statements to the FBI about his Russia contacts. On Oct. 5, 2017, Papadopoulos admitted to lying, becoming the first Trump official to plead guilty and cooperate with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. He served 12 days in federal prison last year.\n\nAD\n\nSince his release in December 2018, Papadopoulos has participated in a documentary series chronicling his relationship with his wife and the aftermath of the Russia investigation, and wrote a book titled, \u201cDeep State Target: How I Got Caught in the Crosshairs of the Plot to Bring Down President Trump.\u201d\n\nBecoming a politician has also been on his to-do list.\n\n\u201cI will be running for Congress in 2020, and I will win,\u201d Papadopoulos tweeted days after leaving a federal prison in Wisconsin in December. \u201cStay tuned.\u201d\n\nIt is true. I will be running for Congress in 2020, and I will win. Stay tuned. \u2014 George Papadopoulos (@GeorgePapa19) December 14, 2018\n\nAD", "description": "Papadopoulos filed paperwork to run as a Republican in California\u2019s 25th District on Tuesday and is expected to formally announce his candidacy later this week.", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/coenMhQAaCgVUvdCq9FBjdBJzJ8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LR7SU7X2T4I6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
