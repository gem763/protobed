But does Harris actually support federally mandating busing herself? We tried to get the campaigns to share their positions on the issue.\n\nThe school-funding gap.\n\nWhat do candidates intend to actually do about deep-set disparities in how some schools are funded versus others? Kamala Harris, for example, has suggested that she wants to totally overhaul the way that schools are financed through local property taxes, but the details on that approach are gossamer thin.\n\nHigher ed is partisan now.\n\nHow is the right talking about education? One recent poll found that just 39 percent of Republicans reported a great deal of confidence in higher ed. And that sentiment is translating into policy: Some red states have implemented deep cuts to their own university budgets. That\u2019s played out acutely in Alaska, where Governor Mike Dunleavy in July took a chainsaw to the University of Alaska\u2019s budget, which would have cut it by 41 percent.\n\n\u2014Saahil Desai\n\nWhat Else We\u2019re Watching\n\n(Scott Morgan / Reuters)\n\nThe heart procedure Bernie Sanders underwent is one of the most common operations in the U.S. James Hamblin gives a doctor\u2019s read on the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s coronary stenting.\n\nTwitter (threat) assessment: President Trump\u2019s latest threats are part of a strategy to raise the cost of proceedings related to the official impeachment inquiry for Democrats, David Graham argues.\n\nFeatured Read\n\n(Schwarz / AP)\n\nWhy do whistle-blowers choose to blow the whistle? Carl Elliott, author of a forthcoming book about whistle-blowers, takes notes from history:\n\nFor the past three weeks I\u2019ve passed the Watergate complex on my bike ride to the Library of Congress, where I\u2019m working on a book about medical whistle-blowers. To claim a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu would probably be an overstatement. Donald Trump is more Spiro Agnew than Richard Nixon, and the whistle-blower propelling the current scandal hasn\u2019t even been identified yet. But it\u2019s hard to avoid comparisons to Watergate when a paranoid, media-bashing president rants about leaks and hides evidence of wrongdoing. \u201cIt\u2019s not the crime; it\u2019s the cover-up that can get you in real trouble,\u201d John Dean told Nixon, who paid no more attention than Trump would have. History doesn\u2019t repeat itself; it doesn\u2019t even rhyme; but occasionally it cracks a joke.\n\n\u2192 Read the rest\n\nOur Reporters Are Also Reading\n\n\u2023 Nancy Pelosi Says Trump Is 'Scared' of an Impeachment Inquiry (John Parkinson, ABC News)\n\n\u2023 Warren Gets a \u2018Dramatic Shift\u2019 in Support From Black Voters (Maya King, Politico)\n\nAbout us: The Atlantic\u2019s politics newsletter is a daily effort from our politics desk.
