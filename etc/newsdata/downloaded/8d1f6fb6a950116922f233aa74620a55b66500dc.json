I still have my imaginary match with Brock in the back of my head. That\u2019s what I do, with anybody on the roster, I\u2019m thinking about what I could do. That\u2019s how my brain works, it could be anybody!\n\n\u2018When it\u2019s someone new, \u201cwhat could we do?\u201d Of course, I think me and Lesnar would have a pretty good match. Especially with the right build-up, it\u2019d be awesome, and something the fans would want to see.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Cesaro was endorsed by Heyman on-screen after WrestleMania 30, he thought it would be the spark that lit his career and took it to the next level, but the focus shifted back to Brock and the Swiss Cyborg found himself slipping back down the pecking order.\n\n\u2018Of course I wish it had gone different, let\u2019s be honest,\u2019 he candidly admitted during our in-depth conversation.\n\n\u2018But to be fair, I also wish I\u2019d done stuff differently. A lot of people point fingers, but I always try to look at what I could have done. I want to learn from the experience, and I\u2019m also very grateful because I learned a lot from Paul Heyman, I learned a lot about how things work.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m trying to make the best of it! Looking back, I can make jokes about it, and poke fun. But I\u2019m all about climbing the mountains, so let\u2019s get the pickax out and start climbing again!\u2019\n\nBrock Lesnar and Paul Heyman (Picture: WWE)\n\nCesaro takes on Richocet on Raw (Picture: WWE)\n\nFor the 38-year-old star \u2013 regarded by many fans as one of the most talented and versatile performers on the entire roster \u2013 there is some professional frustration when it comes to part-time names like Lesnar, or returning legends like The Undertaker and Goldberg coming back into high profile spots, sometimes at the expense of the current full-time names.\n\n\u2018As a fan, you enjoy the nostalgia moments, but I feel it has to be done in the right way. And here\u2019s the thing, I want to remember my heroes like I remember them! And of course, that doesn\u2019t mean they have to look and be like they were, but they have to be in a certain way,\u2019 he explained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018With [the Saudi Arabia and Australia stadium] shows you can see some spectacular things that you never thought was possible, I just think we also need to focus on people who are here on a weekly and daily basis, who are doing all the work.\n\n\u2018At the end of the day, you will not see Goldberg come to Birmingham, England and do a live event \u2013 you just will not! Sorry to disappoint you, spoiler alert, he\u2019s not coming! But there\u2019s a lot of superstars who are going to be there.\u2019\n\nCesaro explained the need to adapt in an industry where everything changes so quickly \u2013 sometimes even just as a show gets underway.\n\nHe pointed to his rival-turned-team mate storyline with Irish star Sheamus \u2013 who has become his best friend \u2013 as a perfect example of this.\n\n\u2018I was like \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be in another team \u2013 especially with the big Irish fella!\u201d It was one of those, I wanted to carve my own place, and then that happened. I was like, this is so stupid,\u2019 he laughed. The best part of that team was obviously the friendship that grew out of it.\n\n\u2018For the viewer, you can see the team grow from two guys who were literally fighting each other in a best of seven series, to become best friends. That journey, you saw it every week. I feel there\u2019s not that many long term storylines in WWE anymore, but that was a long term story! That wasn\u2019t planned, trust me!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Cesaro, as important as the characters and promos are in WWE, he feels the emphasis should always be on the in-ring action, and the magical escape it can provide for fans.\n\n\u2018To me, the most important part of what we do will always be the wrestling, that\u2019s what makes us different,\u2019 he smiled. \u2018I get it, talking is very important. But to be fair, if I want to see somebody talk for an hour, I\u2019ll go and see a stand-up comedy show. That\u2019s what they do.\n\n\u2018English is my second language, I think I speak it pretty well, but I can go anywhere in the world and wrestle and people understand. That\u2019s it. We go to so many countries and that\u2019s what I love to do, to see them lose their minds \u2013 it\u2019s priceless.\u2019\n\n*Friday Night SmackDown airs every week at 1am on Sky Sports Arena and Main Event.
