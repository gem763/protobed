As one ally said: \u201cKarie had lapsed into thinking she ran Jeremy. Thankfully that era is over.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Karie Murphy.

But friends say Lansman willingly became the fall guy, to shield Corbyn from direct responsibility.\n\nThe Guardian understands that while Corbyn had been infuriated by Watson\u2019s speech calling for Labour to become an out-and-out remain party, and his allies had discussed ways of isolating Watson, the Labour leader had specifically asked for no action to be taken before conference.\n\nMurphy, his tough-minded enforcer, pressed ahead, reportedly telling colleagues it was too late to back out. Afterwards, according to two people present, the mild-mannered Corbyn fumed that the chaos made Labour look like \u201cfucking student politicians\u201d. He was forced to step in publicly and defend Watson.\n\nAnd as he and Watson sat alongside each other on the front bench in Westminster later that week, the deputy leader also showed Corbyn a screenshot of flyers handed out in Brighton calling on delegates to disrupt his speech \u2013 which he believed had the imprimatur of the leader\u2019s office.\n\nIronically, the putsch had the reverse effect to that intended by the plotters, and gave Watson a new lease of life.\n\nHe had seemed to colleagues to be increasingly detached in recent weeks, causing some to speculate that he could follow his friend Luciana Berger to the Lib Dems, perhaps taking 20 or so colleagues with him. Instead, he arrived in Brighton emboldened and invigorated.\n\nThe other factor in Murphy\u2019s departure was the resignation of Andrew Fisher, who lashed out against the leader of the opposition\u2019s office (Loto) in a furious parting email.\n\nExtracts were leaked to the Sunday Times. But after news of the shakeup in Loto emerged on Tuesday, the hyper-partisan website Skwawkbox \u2013 widely regarded in Labour circles as Murphy\u2019s mouthpiece \u2013 published the entire note. The picture it painted was less of ruthless ideological shock troops, more of chaos, division and simmering discontent.\n\nThe revered elections expert David Butler said last week that he had \u201cnever felt more confused and uncertain\u201d about the outcome of the coming election.\n\nCorbyn loyalists hope that as in 2017, Labour will be able to reframe the campaign, away from Johnson\u2019s \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d message, and return to the domestic agenda that worked so well for it in 2017 \u2013 though that may be much less effective when the Tories are talking incessantly about funding schools, hospitals and police officers.\n\nIf Johnson returns with the solid majority he craves, however, McDonnell has conceded that he and Corbyn would have to step aside.\n\nAnd with Brexit cutting across the party\u2019s traditional left-right divide, it is very unclear whether they would be followed by a candidate who shares their political perspective. \u201cIt will be chaos,\u201d says one leftwing MP.\n\nCorbyn\u2019s victory over Brexit policy on the conference floor in Brighton underlined the intense loyalty he still commands from Labour members. \u201cThis is Jeremy\u2019s party!\u201d said one jubilant shadow minister at the time.\n\nBut his longtime allies are also well aware that none of their favoured successors \u2013 Rebecca Long-Bailey, Laura Pidcock \u2013 are likely to inspire the same devotion.\n\nInternal polling earlier this year suggested Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry were the most favoured successors among members, with Watson some distance behind, according to insiders.\n\nMcDonnell: I can't see Corbyn staying on if Labour loses election Read more\n\nEarlier in the year, Starmer was rumoured to have struck up what colleagues jokingly called a \u201cbromance\u201d with McDonnell. It would have seen McDonnell dominate economic policy, while Starmer led the party, a 21st-century version of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown\u2019s Granita pact. But the pair deny they were ever considering a deal, and McDonnell made clear in Brighton that he believed the next leader must be a woman.\n\nFirst, though, the party will have to hold together through a potentially rocky general election, with a carefully constructed compromise policy on Brexit. Corbyn\u2019s allies have allowed themselves to be dragged a long way over the past 12 months by a membership for whom, as one puts it, \u201cremain is a feeling\u201d.\n\nBut Starmer and other remainer MPs fear it may not be far enough. One thing appears certain, as all the major parties fire up the battle buses for this most unpredictable of elections: as one leftwing MP puts it, \u201cit\u2019s shit or bust for project Corbyn\u201d.", "description": "Karie Murphy was quietly moved on as the opposition frets over whether it is ready for government", "authors": ["Heather Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35e360f7b93fee45e54a3a3e6bba6354c592da65/74_0_4235_2542/master/4235.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9feaf7e201e0aba454f1b99ad1973e88", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
