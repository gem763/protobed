We see a fair amount of children that wander away, especially if grandma or grandpa happen to be watching them,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou know, a child will wander out a side door, and it usually takes anywhere from 10 minutes to 45 minutes before the calls start for a missing child, and we have not seen that in this case.\u201d\n\nView photos Nicole Merced Plaud | Buffalo Police Department More", "description": "Buffalo Police Trying to Locate Boy's Parents Amid Burning Car Find", "authors": ["Joelle Goldstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KlDncberx3ccWUqNRlEU2g--~B/aD0xODQ2O3c9MTgwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/f54eb49980136c819ecbaced98baf88f", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
