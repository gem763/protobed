We want to thank all of our employees, members and partners for their ongoing commitment,\u201d the company said in a short statement.\n\nWere We Company to have pressed on with the IPO at such a low valuation, it would have represented a major turning point in the growth over the last decade of the venture capital industry, which has led to the rise of startups such as Uber Technologies Inc, Snap Inc and Airbnb Inc.\n\nIt would have meant that We Company would be valued at less than the $12.8 billion in equity it has raised since it was founded in 2010, according to data provider Crunchbase. And it would have been a blow to its biggest backer, Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp, at a time when it is trying to amass $108 billion from investors for its second Vision Fund.\n\nSoftBank was discussing supporting the IPO by snapping up shares worth between $750 million and $1 billion, the sources said. However, We Company decided on Monday that even with SoftBank\u2019s support, the IPO would have raised a little over than $2 billion, short of its target of at least $3 billion.\n\nThis target is tied to a $6 billion credit line We Company secured from banks last month, that calls for an IPO to take place by the end of the year and raise at least $3 billion, one of the sources said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The WeWork logo is displayed on the entrance of a co-working space in New York City, New York U.S., January 8, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nWere the New York-based company to fail to meet this target by the end of the year, it would need to secure alternative funding.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported on the potential IPO delay.\n\nThe sources who spoke to Reuters requested anonymity because the matter is confidential.\n\nThe last time SoftBank invested in We Company was in January at the $47 billion valuation, injecting $2 billion of cash. It had been pushing the company to delay its IPO.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc had been tasked with leading We Company\u2019s IPO as underwriters.\n\nGOVERNANCE CHANGES\n\nWe Company\u2019s decision to delay its IPO indicates it did not feel confident that the corporate governance changes it unveiled on Friday, slightly loosening CEO and co-founder Adam Neumann\u2019s grip on the company, was enough to woo investors concerned about its lack of a path to profitability.\n\nWe Company had said it was making the changes \u201cin response to market feedback\u201d. It said Neumann\u2019s superior voting shares will decrease to 10 votes per share from 20, though he will retain majority control of the company.\n\nNeumann will also give the company any profit he receives from real estate deals he has entered in to with We Company. He will also limit his ability to sell shares in the second and third years after the IPO to no more than 10% of his stock.\n\nNo member of Neumann\u2019s family will be on the company\u2019s board and any successor will be selected by the board, scrapping a plan for his wife and co-founder, Rebekah Neumann, to help pick the successor.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Adam Neumann, CEO of WeWork, speaks to guests during the TechCrunch Disrupt event in Manhattan, in New York City, NY, U.S. May 15, 2017.
