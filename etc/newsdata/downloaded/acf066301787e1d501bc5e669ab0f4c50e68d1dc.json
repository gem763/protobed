Elite Island Resorts says the resort has been designed around the 'three pillars' of gastronomy, personalised service and uninterrupted luxury\n\nGuests visiting the resort will be able to choose from a selection of neat rums and cocktails that have been specially curated by the sommelier.\n\nThe rum drinks will be available in all of the resort's bars - from Nobody Knows, which overlooks the photogenic natural rock arch at Devil's Bridge, to Chairman's Lounge, an indoor space where visitors can play retro games and play vinyl records.\n\nThe creation of a rum sommelier role is part of the new resort's wider pledge to put gastronomy 'centre stage' when it comes to the guest experience.\n\nThe resort will also feature two restaurants with Michelin-trained chef Chef Marco Festini at the helm. Lighthouse will offer locally sourced dishes in the evenings while Irina's will be open throughout the day for breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner and high-brow snacks like caviar.\n\nThe interiors of the villas will feature a contemporary Caribbean design with a neutral mineral palette, which pays homage to the stone excavated from the property\u2019s actual site, according to Elite Island Resorts\n\nThe bathrooms of the five-star villas will feature dark wood furnishings and spacious showers in natural colour schemes\n\nGuests who over-indulge can avail themselves of the onsite spa's facilities. Highlights of the Tranquillity Spa Body and Soul will include five treatment rooms, a plunge pool and an ocean-facing yoga shala.\n\nThose with a little bit more energy to work off the calories in their cocktails might like to take advantage of a range of fitness facilities, which includes a pickleball court, where a game that's a hybrid of table tennis, badminton and traditional tennis can be played.\n\nHammock Cove will be the fifth Elite Island Resorts property on Antigua. Its portfolio there already boasts St. James\u2019 Club and Villas, Galley Bay Resort and Spa, The Verandah Resort and Spa and Pineapple Beach Club.\n\nElite Island Resorts also operates properties on Saint Lucia, Barbados, The Grenadines and in Panama.\n\nPaula Whitehead, European managing director of Elite Island Resorts, said: 'Hammock Cove Resort and Spa complements our existing resorts perfectly with world-class amenities that will wow our guests.\n\n'The stunning secluded setting will be ideal for special occasions including honeymoons and retreats, while the gourmet food offering will make it an unforgettable culinary experience.'\n\n\n\n", "description": "Hammock Cove Resort and Spa will open in Antigua on December 1 and feature a rum sommelier as well as 42 ocean-view villas, plunge pools and food from a Michelin-trained chef.", "authors": ["Sarah Holt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/12/20128220-0-image-a-54_1571918241607.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
