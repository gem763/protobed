Lori is going to move forward as best as she can, but now she has a little more clarity about what will happen next.\"\n\nLORI LOUGHLIN, MOSSIMO GIANNULLI'S OPTIONS ARE 'LIMITED' AFTER PLEADING NOT GUILTY IN COLLEGE SCAM\n\nHuffman, 56, was sentenced to 14 days behind bars after she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud in May. She confessed to paying an admissions consultant $15,000 to have a proctor correct her older daughter's answers on the SAT. She wrote that she'd considered the same for her younger daughter but decided against it.\n\nMOSSIMO GIANNULLI, LORI LOUGHLIN HATE 'CHEATER' LABEL IN COLLEGE SCAM\n\nFELICITY HUFFMAN ON COLLEGE SCAM: 'NO EXCUSES OR JUSTIFICATIONS'\n\nA judge also ordered Huffman to perform 250 hours of community service and pay a $30,000 fine.\n\nLoughlin, 55, and husband Mossimo Giannulli were accused of paying $500,000 to admissions scam mastermind William \"Rick\" Singer to get their daughters Olivia Jade and Isabella recruited onto the USC crew team despite neither girl ever being a rower. USC put the girls' enrollment statuses on hold amid an internal investigation into the scandal.\n\nLORI LOUGHLIN WAS 'OBSESSED' WITH GETTING DAUGHTERS INTO USC, REPORT CLAIMS\n\nThe pair rejected the plea deal that other parents allegedly involved in the case \u2014 including Huffman \u2014 accepted. Giannulli, 56, and Loughlin then were hit with additional charges of money laundering and conspiracy and would face up to 40 years behind bars if convicted on all charges.\n\nALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ SLAMS JUSTICE SYSTEM AMID REPORTS OF FELICITY HUFFMAN'S POTENTIAL PRISON SENTENCE\n\nCOLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL COMING TO TV\n\n\"If she\u2019s found guilty, she will go to jail; that is clear. And if another deal is offered to her, which I don\u2019t think it will be, she will go to jail,\" the source said.\n\n\"Her only chance of avoiding jail is to beat these charges. Lori is a smart woman; she understands that. She\u2019s scared and upset, but she\u2019s resolved to be strong and to fight this. She will do what she has to do to protect herself and her family.\"\n\nLORI LOUGHLIN, MOSSIMO GIANNULLI'S LAWYERS SLAM 'BASELESS ALLEGATIONS' OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\nThe source admitted that Loughlin \"regrets\" not taking the plea agreement when prosecutors initially offered it but insisted Loughlin had no idea she did anything illegal when making the payments to Singer's Key Worldwide Foundation.\n\n\"She didn\u2019t understand the entire nature of the charges against her, and she wasn\u2019t even sure if or how she had broken the law. It was very early, and she didn\u2019t have all the information that she has now,\" the source said. \"Based on what she understood at the time, she made the best choice for herself. Now there is no deal on the table, and she has to have faith that the courts and the prosecution will move fairly and not make an example out of her.\"\n\nLORI LOUGHLIN 'SHOCKED AND SADDENED' THAT COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL MAY RUIN HER 'LEGACY'\n\nMOSSIMO GIANNULLI LIED TO PARENTS ABOUT USC ENROLLMENT, TOOK THEIR TUITION CASH\n\nLegal experts previously told Fox News that Loughlin's and Giannulli's strategy \u2014 essentially pleading ignorance to the scam \u2014 may not hold up in court.\n\n\"The government doesn\u2019t have to prove that Loughlin and Giannulli knew what the payments were used for,\" said attorney Neama Rahmani. \"The fraudulent application to USC is enough to support the conspiracy charges. And there is more than enough circumstantial evidence to prove that they knew the payments were for an illicit or unlawful purpose.\"\n\nLORI LOUGHLIN REPORTEDLY KEEPING CLOSE EYE ON FELICITY HUFFMAN'S CASE, FEARS BEING 'PENALIZED FOR HER FAME' IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL\n\nWhat may work in Loughlin's favor: the decision from the judge in Huffman's case not to throw the book at the \"Desperate Housewives\" star because of her fame \u2014 though it may end up differently for Loughlin and Giannulli, who didn't immediately take responsibility or show remorse for their alleged actions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Indira Talwani told a tearful Huffman during her sentencing, \"I think this is the right sentence here. You can move forward and rebuild your life after this. Without this sentence, I think the community around you would ask why you got away with this.\"\n\nFox News' Mariah Haas and Jessica Napoli contributed to this report.", "description": "Lori Loughlin may have second thoughts about pleading not guilty in the college admissions scandal following Felicity Huffman's 14-day sentence.", "authors": ["Jessica Sager"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/lori-loughlin-felicity-huffman-college-scandal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
