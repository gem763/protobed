He also cited the \u201cnegative\u201d side of free speech.\n\nWatch:\n\nLeBron comments on Daryl Morey\u2019s China tweet: \"I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand and he spoke.\" (via @BenGolliver)pic.twitter.com/kbUxvRgCO3 \u2014 Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) October 15, 2019\n\nIn an interview with TMZ, Khalilah Ali, who was married to Muhammad Ali from 1967-1976, says that her late husband would have handled the NBA-China situation differently. She also believes that James should support people \u201cwho are standing up for their rights.\u201d\n\nWatch:\n\nOf particular note, is when Khalilah Ali stresses that her late, former husband was a \u201cman of the world.\u201d Implying, or stating, that he would have known how to handle the NBA-China situation.\n\nIn reference to the demonstration in Hong Kong which saw protesters burning LeBron James merchandise, Ali buttressed this point by saying: \u201cThey would not take Muhammad Ali\u2019s shorts and burn them anywhere, it would never happen.\u201d\n\nJames has taken considerable criticism from celebrities, fans, and politicians, on both sides of the political aisle. The star NBA forward who has spent nearly ten years taking stands on a variety of social justice issues and heavily criticizing President Trump, is now being seen by many as a social justice warrior of convenience. More than willing to take a stand for his vision of freedom or human rights when there\u2019s no downside to doing so, but quick to betray those principles when they conflict with his business interests.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s that dynamic that most disturbed Khalilah Ali, given the fact that Muhammad Ali was willing to sacrifice three of his prime boxing years when he refused to join the Army during the Vietnam War. Years where Ali could have racked-up considerable victories and money.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "Muhammad Ali's ex-wife expressed her disappointment with NBA star LeBron James's decision to not back pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Mark-J.-Terrill-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
