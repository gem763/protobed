REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nThailand wants Chevron to pay the full decommissioning costs for the energy infrastructure, estimated by one local newspaper at up to $2.5 billion.\n\nThe dispute has implications for other international energy companies such as France\u2019s Total SA (TOTF.PA) and Japan\u2019s Mitsui & Co (8031.T), which also have stakes in offshore energy concessions in the Gulf of Thailand.\n\n\u201cWe have agreed to temporarily suspend the arbitration process to allow more time for resolution discussions,\u201d a Chevron spokesman told Reuters, adding that the company was \u201cencouraged\u201d by the Thai energy minister\u2019s desire to come to an agreement.\n\nA spokesman for Thailand\u2019s energy ministry on Wednesday said he could not comment on talks with Chevron.\n\nMinister of Energy Sontirat Sontijirawong said in July he wanted to resolve the dispute as a matter of urgency to avoid arbitration, but that the issue was complicated.\n\nThe dispute arose in 2016 when Thailand retroactively enforced a new energy ministry regulation requiring gas field operators to pay the costs to decommission all installed assets even if they no longer operate those assets.\n\nChevron argues that under the terms of its initial contracts dating from 1971, it is only liable for infrastructure that is no longer usable.\n\nChevron is due to hand over operation of the Erawan gas field to Thailand\u2019s state-owned oil firm PTT Exploration and Production Pcl (PTTEP.BK) in April 2022 when its concessions expire. The new law would require Chevron to pay the future costs of decommissioning the assets it has installed, including those it transfers over to PTTEP.\n\nChevron told Reuters in July that moving to an arbitration process provided for by the 1971 contracts was a possibility.\n\nThe company had objected to a request by Thailand\u2019s energy ministry to pay a security deposit for the full decommissioning cost of all of the company\u2019s assets in the Erawan gas field.\n\nNeither Chevron nor the ministry would disclose the amount of the requested guarantee when asked by Reuters. But local newspaper Thansettakij has reported it as around 75 billion baht ($2.5 billion), citing industry sources.\n\nThe Chevron spokesman said arbitration was still a possibility if talks do not succeed.\n\nRETROACTIVE LAW\n\nOther operators in Thailand are watching the dispute closely in case it changes their future liabilities for assets in Thailand. Foreign investors in Thailand in other industries were also concerned about what precedent the case might set for the sanctity of their contracts.\n\n\u201cIt will snowball, as it\u2019s not just Chevron,\u201d said Kornkasiwat Kasemsri, director of the Energy and Resources Policy Research Center at Thailand\u2019s Rangsit University.\n\n\u201cWhat decision is made in this case could affect other cases to follow.\u201d\n\nChevron won the concessions to operate four blocks constituting the Erawan gas field, Thailand\u2019s second largest, from 1972 to 2012, after which the contracts were extended for 10 more years.\n\nThe contracts, for blocks 10-11 and 12-13, were first signed under the Petroleum Act of 1971. The act has been amended six times since.\n\nChevron lost out to PTTEP, a unit of the state-owned PTT Pcl (PTT.BK), in a bidding round for the new concession in December.\n\n($1 = 30.9400 baht)", "description": "U.S. energy major Chevron Corp has decided to continue negotiations with Thailand rather than seek arbitration to resolve a dispute over who should pay the bill for removing offshore oil and gas platforms, the company told Reuters on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Patpicha Tanakasempipat", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433875994&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O1XU", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
