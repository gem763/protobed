Ted Cruz (R-Texas), one of the last candidates to drop out of the pool of Republican presidential hopefuls in 2016 and the runner-up to Donald Trump, still has his eye on the White House.\n\nIn a Thursday breakfast discussion with The Christian Science Monitor, the senator revealed he may one day throw his hat back in the ring.\n\n\u201cLook, I hope to run again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe came very, very close in 2016. And it\u2019s the most fun I\u2019ve ever had in my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe great thing is, every issue I was fighting for in the presidential campaign is front and center in the Senate,\u201d he added.\n\nDuring the 2016 race, Trump infamously insulted Cruz as \u201clyin\u2019 Ted,\u201d propagated an evidence-free conspiracy theory that his father, Rafael, was involved in President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination, and denigrated the senator\u2019s wife on Twitter, threatening to \u201cspill the beans\u201d on her.\n\nCruz, who was one of 17 candidates vying for the nomination, managed to earn the support of more than 7 million voters during his campaign, exiting the race in May 2016. One day later, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich followed suit, leaving Trump the presumptive nominee.\n\nBacking away from an endorsement of Trump, Cruz was met with a chorus of boos at the Republican National Convention months before the election, when he told conservatives to \u201cvote your conscience.\u201d\n\nHowever, Cruz eventually announced he would vote for Trump.\n\nIn 2018, Cruz was narrowly reelected to his Senate seat, beating out former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas), who is now jockeying for the presidency alongside 19 other Democrats.\n\nAs Trump now gears up for 2020, Cruz told the Monitor his state would be a \u201cbattleground.\u201d\n\n\u201cTexas is going to be hotly contested in 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe the president will win Texas. I think it will be closer than last time.\u201d", "description": "The Texas senator was the distant runner-up to Donald Trump in the 2016 Republican primaries.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7baf59230000100552d1f3.jpeg?cache=ek3tqfxqgn&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
