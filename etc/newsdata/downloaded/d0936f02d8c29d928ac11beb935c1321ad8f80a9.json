And they\u2019ve hammered the president more than ever on a range of allegations, from campaign-finance crimes to abuses of power.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPro-impeachment Democrats are hoping that a renewed focus on corruption and self-dealing could give their effort to oust Trump the momentum that former special counsel Robert Mueller never had.\n\n\u201cThe Mueller report has clearly been muddled and I\u2019m not sure that the public really has much of a concept of what that showed,\u201d said Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), who supports impeachment. \u201cAnd corruption is pretty easy to understand.\u201d\n\nWhile they\u2019re not quite admitting defeat on the Mueller report, Yarmuth and other pro-impeachment lawmakers cited efforts by the White House and the Justice Department to slow-walk the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s subpoenas for documents and testimony related to the Mueller probe, many of which are lagging in federal court and could take months to reach a conclusion.\n\nThe White House\u2019s posture has made it more difficult for Democrats to hold a public airing of the allegations contained within the 448-page Mueller report, most notably the president\u2019s efforts to shut down the investigation altogether.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) said.\n\n\u201cPeople understand what it means for the president to be spending millions of dollars in federal government tax dollars at his own business properties,\u201d added Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nCongress is uniquely suited to address potential violations of the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments clauses, which bar a president from profiting off spending by the U.S. or foreign governments. Trump has faced criticism on this issue from Democrats since before he was sworn in as president, in part because he did not completely divest from his business empire.\n\n\u201cI have said from the very beginning that the original sin of the Trump administration is that he\u2019s converted the government into an instrument of self-enrichment,\u201d Raskin added. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt this is the heart of it. When Donald Trump said he was going to blow up the Mueller investigation if they looked at his finances, that told us precisely where we needed to go. And I think we\u2019ve got to follow the money. The Constitution will save us.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats will take their most significant step toward impeachment proceedings later this week when the Judiciary Committee votes on a resolution that underscores the parameters of its impeachment investigation into the president \u2014 a probe that is certain to include the allegations that Trump has repeatedly violated the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments clauses.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s no question that people tend to react more strongly to direct evidence of corruption and financial gain and using the presidency for your own financial benefit,\u201d added Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, a member of the House Judiciary Committee and Democratic leadership.\n\n\u201cWhat they will learn about the obstruction of justice \u2014 coupled with the president\u2019s corruption \u2014 taken together are going to be sufficient for the American people to be persuaded that we should move forward with impeachment,\u201d Cicilline added.\n\nPublicly, Judiciary Committee Democrats argue that they haven\u2019t shifted strategies, pointing to a spate of upcoming high-profile hearings and court battles related to the Mueller probe as they seek to build a public case that Trump obstructed justice.\n\nRep. David Cicilline. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\n\nBut privately, Democrats in favor of ousting Trump have complained about how the process has been handled so far \u2014 from months of jousting with the White House over technocratic process fights to contradictory talking points from top Democrats about meaning of \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d and whether the House had actually launched one.\n\nThe new spate of self-dealing allegations came after Trump openly suggested that his Doral resort in Miami, Fla., should host the annual G-7 summit next year. Such a decision could force foreign governments, as well as the U.S. government, to funnel money to Trump\u2019s business empire to participate in international diplomacy, an apparent violation of the Emoluments clauses.\n\nMore recently, Vice President Mike Pence lodged at Trump\u2019s resort in Doonbeg, Ireland, and commuted back and forth from Dublin. After Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Marc Short, initially said Trump \u201csuggested\u201d that the vice president stay at the Trump-owned hotel, the president said on Monday that he had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with the decision.\n\nAnd last week, POLITICO revealed that the House Oversight and Reform Committee has been investigating an instance in which Air National Guard members stayed at Trump\u2019s luxury waterside resort in Turnberry, Scotland, during a routine stopover from the U.S. to Kuwait. On Monday, Trump said the Turnberry stop, too, has \u201cnothing to do with me.\u201d\n\nThe Judiciary Committee has launched probes into both Trump\u2019s G7 suggestion as well as Pence\u2019s stay at Trump\u2019s property in Doonbeg. Committee members received a list of talking points on Monday that specifically highlighted corruption-related allegations against the president.\n\nIn the meantime, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has remained steadfastly opposed to impeachment. She has argued repeatedly, including in a caucus call late last month, that the public support just isn\u2019t there as nearly 60 percent of Americans still don\u2019t support the idea, according to recent polls.\n\n\u201cWe are legislating, we\u2019re investigating, and we are litigating. We are taking our information to court,\u201d Pelosi told reporters on Monday. \u201c[W]e are on the path of investigation, and that includes the possibility of legislation or impeachment.\u201d\n\nYet Pelosi last week sharply condemned Trump for \u201cviolating the Constitution\u201d for allegedly steering business to his resorts, adding another notch to her lexicon of attacks that inch closer to accusing Trump of impeachable conduct.\n\nDemocrats know that they are running up against a rapidly shrinking calendar. Many acknowledge that the start of the 2020 election season is likely an unofficial deadline for the House to realistically consider impeachment.\n\nTo Republicans, the rhetorical reset is a sign that Democrats are grasping for a strategy to justify potential impeachment when their earlier attempts failed to gain momentum.\n\n\u201cJudiciary Democrats are trying to pull a fast one on Americans,\u201d said Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary panel. \u201cThey know they don\u2019t have the votes for the whole House to impeach, so they\u2019re trying to adopt committee rules to govern an \u2018impeachment investigation\u2019 the House hasn\u2019t even authorized.\u201d\n\nSarah Ferris and Kyle Cheney contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "Lawmakers argue Trump's alleged corruption is easier for the public to understand than \"arcane terms\" like obstruction of justice.", "authors": ["Andrew Desiderio", "Heather Caygle"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c9/64/b63eb425405596a6680717ae8009/190909-raskin-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
