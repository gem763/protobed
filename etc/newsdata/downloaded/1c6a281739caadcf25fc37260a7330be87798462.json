We refuse to believe that it\u2019s all over.\n\nWhile the events surrounding the airing of the final series (cry) earlier this year \u2013 as well as Sophie Turner\u2019s wedding \u2013 gave the cast cause to reunite, they apparently barely see each other post-Thrones.\n\nFor Isaac, who is currently studying neuroscience at University College London, the film industry is a \u2018small world\u2019 and the cast often move in the same circles, but their hectic schedules keep them from hanging out.\n\nThe Stark siblings (Picture: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic for HBO)\n\nWe\u2019re not crying, you\u2019re crying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile 2019 saw us say goodbye to the on-screen world of Game of Thrones (at least until the prequel airs!), we still have two of George R. R. Martin\u2019s books to be written.\n\nCould the books have a totally different ending to the show? Isaac exclusively told Metro.co.uk that he\u2019d be \u2018gutted\u2019 if the books veered away from the TV show and saw someone other than Bran sit on the Iron Throne.\n\n\u2018I will be a bit gutted, I think,\u2019 Isaac confessed.\n\nHowever, the actor was able to see the positives to an alternative ending, saying: \u2018What\u2019s nice is the fact the books and the show were able to evolve as their own thing, so George has no obligations to end it in any of the same ways we did.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018That\u2019s quite cool, you\u2019re going to get two alternative endings to Game of Thrones.\u2019\n\nYou\u2019re telling us, Isaac.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
