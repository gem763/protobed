It\u2019s wide open according to some. And I find that as I go around,\u201d Sestak told Fox News on Friday. \u201cI just need to get in front of them physically and on the air, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing the walk and that\u2019s why the ad\u2019s up,\u201d\n\nThe ad he refers to is a commercial that\u2019s running on local broadcast and cable TV during his trek.\n\nSestak says he\u2019s \u201cstopping everywhere to meet with people\u2026It\u2019s a great learning experience.\u201d\n\nAs he makes stops in roadside cafes or restaurants - to \u201cgo in for a coffee and chat with somebody\u201d - he notes that \u201cto a person, they\u2019re glad when I sit down and just go in\u2026The response is fantastic. I\u2019m not just saying that.\u201d\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Sestak\u2019s taken to walking the roads as he runs for office. He trekked across Pennsylvania in 2014 during his second unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate.\n\nBut he shared that the \u201coriginal idea\u201d came from Pulitzer prize winning decades old book \u2018To Kill a Mockingbird.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe used to read it to our daughter. And there Atticus says to his daughter Scout, who repeats it in the book, \u2018you can\u2019t know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them,\u2019\u201d he explained as he paraphrased the book.\n\nSestak\u2019s long-shot bid isn\u2019t grabbing a lot of national attention, but he optimistically noted it doesn\u2019t get frustrating \u201cbecause I really do believe that there\u2019s a decent chance.\u201d\n\nAnd as he often does, Sestak highlighted his come from behind primary win over incumbent Sen. Arlen Specter in the 2010 Democratic Senate nomination race.\n\nAnd he emphasized that \u201cwe have enough (campaign cash) to keep on going and we\u2019ll continue full operations well into next year.\n\nSestak's far from qualifying for the Democratic presidential primary debates. He jabbed at the Democratic National Committee for using fundraising as one of the two thresholds to qualify for the debates.\n\n\u201cOnce you begin to use money as an indicator of support, it kind of hurts the system. And the Democrats should be about support not measured by money,\u201d he emphasized.\n\nSestak\u2019s walking at a brisk pace, saying on average he treks 3.5 to 3.7 miles per hour. A car with a support staffer or two \u2013 who tweet and post video of the trip along the way - is always within a mile or two of the candidate.\n\nIt\u2019s a non-traditional journey. Sestak will often stop down and jump into the support vehicle to attend an event or make a campaign stop or two before heading back to the spot where he stopped his trip, so he can resume his journey. And each evening he returns to a home in southern New Hampshire, where he stays with friends.\n\nSestak ends his trip Sunday along the harbor in the coastal city of Portsmouth.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to talk about national security as I stand right there, on the harbor that looks east,\u201d he noted. \u201cThat\u2019s where I sailed across to combat in a ship and I\u2019m going to talk about how we really do need today someone who understands \u2013 with breadth and depth of global experience \u2013 how this world needs to be led by America.\u201d\n\nSestak told Fox News that \u201cit doesn\u2019t get lonely\u201d on his walk. He explained that it gives him \u201ca lot of time for thinking.\u201d\n\nBut highlighting the dangers of walking across the Granite State, he noted that he has to stay alert along the journey.\n\n\u201cYou get in some pretty narrow roadways there with heavy trucks going by. No sidewalks,\u201d he stressed.", "description": "Joe Sestak faces an extremely long and uphill march to win the Democratic presidential nomination \u2013 but that\u2019s just what the retired three-star U.S. Navy admiral and former two-term congressman from Pennsylvania\u2019s doing \u2013 taking his challenging journey one step at a time.", "authors": ["Paul Steinhauser", "Paul Steinhauser Is A Politics Reporter Based In New Hampshire."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/JoeSestak-walkNH1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
