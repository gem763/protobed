He hasn\u2019t really deviated from Sessions\u2019s overall policy agenda since taking over DOJ. In some aspects of immigration and criminal-justice matters, he\u2019s even gone further than Sessions ever did. But his greatest achievement so far is doing what his predecessor spent almost two years resisting: transforming the Justice Department from a semi-independent actor into an instrument of Trump\u2019s political interests.\n\nTrump never masked his views on how his attorneys general should act. He believes that the Justice Department should protect him and his friends from legal troubles while inflicting them on his enemies. Multiple White House aides told Mueller that Trump would describe Robert F. Kennedy and Eric Holder as attorneys general who shielded their presidents from political harm, and how he needed to find one like them. To Trump, the attorney general is just another lawyer who should be aggressively advancing his personal interests\u2014another Roy Cohn, or Michael Cohen, or Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThat\u2019s not how it\u2019s supposed to work. Government officials are supposed to act in the public interest. Since Watergate, the Justice Department has also tried to maintain a degree of separation between its investigatory powers and the White House\u2019s political interests. Trump knows this, and he doesn\u2019t like it. \u201cYou know, the saddest thing is that because I\u2019m the president of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department,\u201d Trump said in a radio interview last November. \u201cI am not supposed to be involved with the FBI. I\u2019m not supposed to be doing the kind of things that I would love to be doing. And I\u2019m very frustrated by it.\u201d\n\nIt would be a mistake to think of Barr as one of the supine flunkies with whom the president usually surrounds himself. Barr simply happens to agree with Trump\u2019s views on executive power, the Russia investigation, and the attorney general\u2019s role in American democracy. He made those views clear well before his appointment, drafting an unsolicited 19-page memo in June 2017 that argued Mueller couldn\u2019t lawfully investigate Trump for obstruction of justice. Barr also told a New York Times reporter in November that he had \u201clong believed that the predicate for investigating the uranium deal, as well as the [Clinton] foundation, is far stronger than any basis for investigating so-called \u2018collusion.\u2019\u201d Sessions, for his part, resisted GOP demands to appoint a second special counsel to investigate the Clintons by referring the matter to career federal prosecutors, where it promptly died.\n\nIn a CBS News interview in May, Barr said he was concerned about foreign election interference and had taken steps to prevent it ahead of the 2020 election. Then he said he was equally worried that some sort of federal bureaucratic cadre\u2014a deep state, perhaps?\u2014could undermine American democracy. \u201cI mean, republics have fallen because of praetorian guard mentality where government officials get very arrogant, they identify the national interest with their own political preferences and they feel that anyone who has a different opinion, you know, is somehow an enemy of the state,\u201d Barr explained. \u201cAnd you know, there is that tendency that they know better and that, you know, they\u2019re there to protect as guardians of the people. That can easily translate into essentially supervening the will of the majority and getting your own way as a government official.\u201d", "description": "It takes a special kind of attorney general to make Jeff Sessions seem scrupulous.", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/d469c893090020eddbb7ccb4d95311592b3b0970.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
