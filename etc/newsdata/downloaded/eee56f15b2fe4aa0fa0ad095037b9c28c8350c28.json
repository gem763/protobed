It murdered hostages and massacred civilians \u2013 most of them Muslims in Iraq and Syria.\n\nBorn in the Iraqi city of Samarra in 1971 and radicalised by the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, Baghdadi claimed to have descended from the prophet Muhammad. His background in religious instruction gave him legitimacy in the eyes of his jihadist followers.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In a few short years, he took the organisation from an underground insurgency to a proto-state that ruled over millions of people.\n\nIn a statement delivered from the White House on Sunday morning, US president Donald Trump struck a triumphant tone as he described Baghdadi\u2019s death in grisly detail.\n\n\u201cHe died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place,\u201d he said. \u201cBaghdadi\u2019s demise demonstrates America\u2019s relentless pursuit of terrorist leaders,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd yet, Baghdadi\u2019s death will not be the end of Isis. In fact, his death comes at a time when Trump\u2019s policy in Syria may be assisting its resurgence.\n\nA chaotic partial withdrawal of US troops from the Syrian border earlier this month precipitated a new round of conflict in northeast Syria, just months after the caliphate was defeated there.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Dozens of civilians have been killed and more than 100 Isis prisoners are thought to have escaped.\n\nThe SDF, which worked alongside the US military to defeat Isis in Syria, has slowed its operations against sleeper cells in order to fight Turkey and its Syrian proxies.\n\nThe US troop presence in Syria, while small in number, had acted as a deterrence for a Turkish attack against the SDF, which Ankara views as a terror group for its ties to Kurdish separatists in Turkey.\n\n\u201cEliminating a terrorist leader of this significance and prominence is a major accomplishment for the intelligence and military personnel who made it possible. And it\u2019s a serious step in degrading Isis\u2019s ability to continue radicalising and recruiting,\u201d said Joshua A Geltzer, a former senior director for counterterrorism on the National Security Council in the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cBut the group is bigger than Baghdadi, and this operation alone doesn\u2019t come close to overcoming the strategic error Trump made in abandoning America\u2019s top ground partners in the fight against Isis \u2013 a fight that\u2019s far from over.\u201d\n\nIn its response to Baghdadi\u2019s death, the SDF reiterated that the Turkish operation that Trump gave a green light to has provided \u201ca fertile ground for the revival of Isis and threatens the region and the entire international community\u201d.\n\nAdding to the confusion over his policy in Syria, Trump repeated his desire on Sunday to use US military personnel to protect oil fields in the east of the country, identifying it as a top priority.\n\nAfter leaving the Syria-Turkey border region to get out of the way of Turkey\u2019s military operation, and crossing into Syria, the US sent troops back into Syria again to guard oil fields.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to keep soldiers between Syria and Turkey for the next 200 years,\u201d Trump told reporters after his address on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re out, but we are leaving soldiers to secure the oil.\u201d\n\nIn these conditions, analysts warn, the dangers of an Isis comeback only increase. As the US retreats further from Syria, operations such as the one that killed Baghdadi will be harder to carry out.\n\n\u201cIn the interim, Isis will likely suffer from uncertainty, as the power shift occurs, but ultimately, the extent of instability, vacuums and opportunities presented in Syria and Iraq are of far more advantage than the loss of a leader,\u201d said Charles Lister, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute and author of The Syrian Jihad.\n\n\u201cPerhaps more importantly, Baghdadi\u2019s death gives Trump his best excuse yet to see \u2018Syria\u2019 as a job done and dusted. That would be extremely unwise, as this is precisely the time when the hammer should be placed squarely and intensively on Isis\u2019s head, to better ensure that it can\u2019t recover in the way we all fear,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the meantime, as the war against Isis becomes less of a concern for Trump, the communities that suffered from the terror group\u2019s rise the first time around will be in the firing line again.", "description": "Long before the Isis caliphate met its downfall, before it lost its first battle, when its brutal fighters ruled over a land that spread across two countries and carried out massacres at will, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi knew he was on borrowed time.", "authors": ["Richard Hall"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/27/14/eh48omcwoaelabe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
