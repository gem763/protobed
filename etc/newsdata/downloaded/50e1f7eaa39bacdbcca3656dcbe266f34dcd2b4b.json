Sentiments also improved as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Friday that the central bank will continue to act \"as appropriate\" to sustain the economic expansion in the world's biggest economy.\n\nBut, broader stock market gains were tempered in the wake of lackluster economic data - U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in August, while earlier on Monday data showed Japan's economy grew at a slower pace than initially estimated in the second quarter. I find that this negative aspect of global news flow may prevail over the positive sentiments of Indian equity markets. On analysis of the , in different time frames, I find that the Nifty looks to be facing stiff resistance at the level of 11058; which may result in the sharp downward move if the European equity indices open in the red.
