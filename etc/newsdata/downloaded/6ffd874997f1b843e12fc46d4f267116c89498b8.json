A lot,\u201d she told People. \u201cBut we also talk sports, we talk a lot of sports; we talk a lot about Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 you know, all the things that I am passionate about.\u201d\n\nCHRIS PRATT, KATHERINE SCHWARZENEGGER CELEBRATE BRIDAL SHOWER AT MARIA SHRIVER'S HOME\n\nShe continued: \u201cI\u2019ll talk about politics like, \u2018Did you see the debate last night?\u2019 Not just to talk about politics, but if there is something going on, I\u2019ll talk about it. But I won\u2019t just bring it up to start a fight.\u201d\n\nShriver, a Kennedy niece, would likely have a hard time keeping the discussions away from politics given that her large family is a blend of political scions and Hollywood stars. She has four kids, Katherine, 29, Christina, 28, Patrick, 26, and Christopher, 21, with ex-husband Arnold Schwarzenegger, an actor and former Republican governor of California. In addition, she comes from a large family herself, with four brothers who she tries to gather every year for the holiday. She also prides herself on making invitations to her Thanksgiving table open to anyone who is alone, according to People.\n\nKATHERINE SCHWARZENEGGER SLAMS TROLL WHO SAYS KENNEDY GRANDDAUGHTER DOES NOTHING 'FOR SOCIETY'\n\n\u201cI have four brothers, so I always have to get at least one of my brothers to come,\u201d she explained. \u201cThat\u2019s important to me because we used to always go home to my parents, when they were alive, in Washington. \u2026 My brother Bobby will come with his family, so that makes me feel, you know, grounded and protected.\u201d\n\nThe mother of four has a lot to be thankful for this year as her eldest daughter, Katherine, married \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d and \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d actor Chris Pratt in June.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I'm a mother-in-law now. I started the year kind of just myself, and I became 'Mother of the Bride,' everyone started MOB-ing me,\" she said on the \u201cToday\u201d show at the time. \"And now I'm actually a mother-in-law. It feels different. It feels great!\"", "description": "Unlike most families, politics isn't a taboo topic of discussion at Maria Shriver\u2019s Thanksgiving dinner table.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/maria-shriver-getty-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
