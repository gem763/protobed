(NASDAQ:DGIC.B) A Strong Dividend Stock?", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "Could Donegal Group Inc. (NASDAQ:DGIC.B) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul? Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nA high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Donegal Group. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. Some simple analysis can offer a lot of insights when buying a company for its dividend, and we'll go through this below.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Donegal Group!\n\nNasdaqGS:DGIC.B Historical Dividend Yield, September 3rd 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Donegal Group paid out 102% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, from the perspective of an investor who hopes to own the company for many years, a payout ratio of above 100% is definitely a concern.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on Donegal Group's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Donegal Group's dividend payments. The dividend has been stable over the past 10 years, which is great. We think this could suggest some resilience to the business and its dividends. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.37 in 2009, compared to US$0.51 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 3.3% a year over that time.\n\nWhile the consistency in the dividend payments is impressive, we think the relatively slow rate of growth is unappealing.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. Donegal Group's earnings per share have shrunk at 13% a year over the past five years. With this kind of significant decline, we always wonder what has changed in the business. Dividends are about stability, and Donegal Group's earnings per share, which support the dividend, have been anything but stable.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Donegal Group's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. First, it's not great to see how much of its earnings are being paid as dividends. Second, it has a limited history of earnings per share growth, but at least the dividends have been relatively stable. To conclude, we've spotted a couple of potential concerns with Donegal Group that may make it less than ideal candidate for dividend investors.\n\nYou can also discover whether shareholders are aligned with insider interests by checking our visualisation of insider shareholdings and trades in Donegal Group stock.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Could Donegal Group Inc.
