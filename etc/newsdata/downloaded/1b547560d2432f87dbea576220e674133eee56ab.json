Others have pointed to the hypocrisy of \u201cwoke\u201d NBA celebrities, such as Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich, \u201cbrave\u201d when defending elite morality in America but abject cowards when faced with actual cases of oppression that potentially conflict with their financial interests or contractual obligations.\n\nBut there\u2019s a subtler point that it's easy to miss: The censorious arguments from Beijing\u2019s defenders sound like they could come from the mouths of campus leftists or appear on the pages of America's liberals magazines.\n\nTake the letter from Joe Tsai, the billionaire who owns most of the New Jersey Nets. The first part of the letter conflates, again and again, the demands of the Chinese state to silence opposition with the demands of \"fans.\"\n\n\u201cChinese fans have reacted extremely negatively to a tweet put out by Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey,\" Tsai begins. \"The Rockets \u2026 are now effectively shut out of the Chinese market as fans abandon their love for the team,\" he adds later. \"Fans in China are calling for an explanation,\" Tsai goes on.\n\nTsai then adopts a stance that is very familiar to those who have tried to host a conservative speaker or even a debate on a liberal campus: Free speech isn\u2019t for sensitive topics that affect \u201ccertain cultures.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]he NBA has been very progressive in allowing players and other constituents a platform to speak out on issues,\u201d Tsai writes. \u201cThe problem is, there are certain topics that are third-rail issues in certain countries, societies and communities.\u201d\n\nSupporting Hong Kong independence is out of bounds for \u201call citizens in China,\u201d Tsai claims. \u201cThis issue is non-negotiable.\u201d\n\nHe writes as if increasing Hong Kongers\u2019 rights \u2014 or, by implication, granting independence to Taiwan \u2014 would demolish China\u2019s \u201cterritorial integrity.\u201d\n\nThis echoes the specious left-wing tactic of declaring opinions as intolerable if they \u201cdeny or question my right to exist.\u201d This argument is constantly rolled out against arguments that certainly do not deny or question anyone\u2019s right to exist.\n\nTsai also justifies this censorious mindset by telling the timeworn tale that China's government uses to justify its current belligerence. It all goes back to colonial oppression and China's \"century of humiliation,\" with the blame mostly falling on the British. The Chinese communists use this as their sob story when trying to win sympathy for their own illiberal behavior.\n\nThankfully, it doesn\u2019t seem to be working. The American Left is no warmer to China's strong-arm efforts than is the American Right. American liberals who cheered the political activism of NBA celebrities are now audibly lamenting their silence, and good for them.\n\nThere's plenty of reason to worry that parts of the American Left are abandoning the principles of pluralism, tolerance, and free speech. Here's hoping that some censorious intolerance from China is stirring up these old principles and putting the liber- back into American liberals.", "description": "The embarrassing spectacle of the NBA\u2019s millionaire players and billionaire owners doing the bidding of China\u2019s communist rulers, and even attacking the United States in the process, has forced Americans to ask questions about our national culture.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5eadc28/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5049x2651+0+357/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F94%2Fba%2F51d8ad9b413bac896e4e0a8b2ae9%2Fap-19261664219311.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
