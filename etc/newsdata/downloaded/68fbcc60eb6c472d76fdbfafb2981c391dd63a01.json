We thought it'd be a nice idea to celebrate them all and everything they do.\"\n\nThe funnyman added: \"We have done an over-50s special in the past, but this is the decade. It's celebrating the 80s, so I've gone back to my Miami Vice days. I'll be in a white suit with a pastel vest and all the girls will have big hair.\n\n\"The music and everything about the show will be 80s. I'm really looking forward to that, it'll be a lot of fun.\"\n\nTake Me Out returns to ITV on Saturday 26th October at 7:15pm.", "description": "Tammy from Blackpool is a Close Protection Officer who's looking to find love on Take Me Out's new series", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images For Tyler Perry Stu"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20672725.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Tyler-Perry-Studios-Grand-Opening-Gala.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
