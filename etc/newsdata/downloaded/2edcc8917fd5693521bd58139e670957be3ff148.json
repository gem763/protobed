White House\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump's acting chief of staff acknowledged Thursday that aid to Ukraine at the center of a House impeachment inquiry was withheld because of the president's desire for the country to probe U.S. domestic politics.\n\nMick Mulvaney's assertion was the first time a White House official conceded Trump set up a quid quo pro scenario in which money approved by Congress for Ukraine was used as leverage. Hours after his remarks drew bipartisan criticism, Mulvaney reversed course and said in a statement the money was withheld chiefly over concerns about corruption.\n\nAt a news briefing, Mulvaney said the president told him he was concerned about corruption and the fact that other countries weren't chipping in more to help pay for Ukraine's security. Mulvaney said Trump mentioned \"in passing\" that he considered part of that corruption to involve unfounded claims about the 2016 election.\n\nAmong those claims: Trump sought Ukraine's help in finding out whether a hacked Democratic National Committee server and 33,000 emails from Democrat Hillary Clinton's tenure running the U.S. State Department \"could be\" in the country.\n\n\"Did he also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely,\" Mulvaney said during a briefing at the White House on Thursday, recalling a conversation he had with the president about corruption in Kyiv.\n\n\"That\u2019s it,\" Mulvaney said. \"That\u2019s why we held up the money.\"\n\nMulvaney rows back\n\nActing White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney answers questions during a briefing at the White House October 17, 2019.

A summary of the call released by the White House showed Trump raised the issue of interference in the 2016 election as well as former Vice President Biden soon after discussing aid to Kyiv.\n\nDemocrats suspect Trump was trying to strong-arm Ukraine into an investigation to discredit political rival Joe Biden.\n\nSondland: Trump ambassador 'disappointed' with Rudy Giuliani's influence in Ukraine\n\nMulvaney said there is nothing wrong with threatening to withhold foreign aid to pressure a country to change a policy \u2013 in this case, he said, to fight corruption.\n\n\"We do that all that time with foreign policy,\" Mulvaney said, noting that the White House threatened to withhold money to Central America over immigration policies.\n\nMick Mulvaney, acting White House chief of staff, says the Trump administration also threatened to withhold money from Central American countries. (Photo: Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\nTrump has repeatedly asserted that he did not withhold the money in exchange for Ukraine's help in looking into political foes, and Mulvaney said, \"The money held up had absolutely nothing to do with Biden.\" Mulvaney framed the issue as Trump calling on Ukraine to help Attorney General William Barr with an investigation into 2016 election interference.\n\n\"The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing he was worried about in corruption with that nation,\" Mulvaney said of the president.\n\nA senior Justice Department official speaking on the condition of anonymity sought to distance Barr's probe from Mulvaney's remarks: \"If the White House was withholding aid in regards to cooperation with an investigation at the Department of Justice, that is news to us,\u201d the official said.\n\nTrump sought Ukraine's help in finding out whether a hacked Democratic National Committee server and 33,000 emails from Democrat Hillary Clinton's tenure running the U.S. State Department \"could be\" in the country.\n\nUkraine: Trump's conspiracy theories thrive in Ukraine\n\nThe president's phone call with Zelensky prompted a flurry of subpoenas sent to the Trump administration. Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, told lawmakers Thursday that withholding aid for political reasons would be wrong.\n\nLawmakers react to Mulvaney\n\nWhen reporters told Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, of Mulvaney\u2019s statements, she said, \"That's news to me; I had not heard that. Yes, absolutely it's a concern. You don't hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative.\"\n\nAsked whether it rose to the level of an impeachable offense, Murkowski said she needs to look at exactly what Mulvaney said.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney announces that the G7 will be held at Trump National Doral on Oct. 17, 2019.

Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. \"Doesn't mean he's not entitled to a fair process.\"\n\nContributing: Kevin Johnson\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/17/mick-mulvaney-says-ukraine-aide-held-over-us-domestic-politics/4009147002/", "description": "Donald Trump's acting chief of staff said  aid to Ukraine was withheld because of the president's concerns over Ukrainian corruption.", "authors": ["John Fritze", "David Jackson", "Nicholas Wu", "Published P.M.
