Everyone gets a chance, but the septuagenarians go first. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) rehashes stuff she has said before about the Mueller report and the rule of law. Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), recently recovered from a heart attack, looks well as he explains President Trump\u2019s alleged crimes. Former vice president Joe Biden, coifed and tailored as if he just stepped out of a men\u2019s store catalogue, can\u2019t settle on whether Trump is \u201cthe most corrupt president in modern history\u201d or \u201call of our history.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n5 minutes. Because everyone has basically the same answer on impeachment, the candidates search for ways to define their brands. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) quotes the author Maya Angelou. Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) speaks about feelings and duty. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) says Trump is making \u201cRussia great again.\u201d Former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro talks about Ohio job losses. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg gestures with his hands as he asks America to envision the day after Trump is pushed from office. \u201cIt starts out feeling like a happy thought,\u201d he says. \u201cBut really think about where we\u2019ll be: vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now.\u201d\n\n12 minutes. Gabbard says impeachment should not be partisan. Steyer tries to get applause by calling Trump a \u201ccriminal in the White House.\u201d Yang uses the moment to blame Amazon, a company run by the owner of The Washington Post, for \u201cclosing 30 percent of America\u2019s stores and malls\u201d and paying no taxes. Former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke (Tex.), in his trademark poetry-slam cadence, riffs on how Trump has betrayed those who have served the country in uniform.\n\n16 minutes. Biden gets a question about his son Hunter, who got a job for a Ukrainian gas company while he held elected office \u2014 and whose dealings have become a focus for Trump\u2019s attacks on the former vice president. \u201cI want to point out there\u2019s no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you,\u201d Cooper says, before asking if it was wrong for family members of vice presidents to take jobs like that. Biden doesn\u2019t seem to want to answer. Instead, he says no one did anything wrong and he never talked business with his son. \u201cThis is about Trump\u2019s corruption. That\u2019s what we should be focusing on,\u201d Biden says.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n18 minutes. Cooper tries to get Sanders to bite on Hunter Biden. Sanders responds by talking about \u201cthe pain of the working class of this country.\u201d\n\n20 minutes. Now it is Warren\u2019s time in the frying pan. Marc Lacey, an editor at the New York Times, which is co-hosting the debate with CNN, asks the question Warren won\u2019t answer. Will she raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare-for-all? Warren still won\u2019t answer. Instead, she talks about the \u201c70,000 selfies\u201d she has taken with voters, which really aren\u2019t selfies because someone else is holding the camera.\n\n21 minutes. Lacey tries again, asking if she should acknowledge what is obvious. Warren, a former high school debate champion, responds this time with a double negative. \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families,\u201d she says. She won\u2019t say taxes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n22 minutes. Nearly half the people onstage are ready to pounce. Some want to debate the policy. Others want to turn Warren\u2019s strategy of not admitting what everyone knows into a proxy for her character. \u201cWell, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer,\u201d says Buttigieg. Warren bites back by saying the mayor\u2019s plan \u2014 Medicare-for-all who want it \u2014 is really \u201cMedicare-for-all who can afford it.\u201d Snap.\n\n25 minutes. After a quick rebuttal that notes his plan\u2019s subsidies, Buttigieg deftly pivots back to his opening theme. Warren, he says, wants to disrupt and divide the day after Trump leaves office. \u201cWhy unnecessarily divide this country over health care when there\u2019s a better way to deliver coverage for all?\u201d he asks. Sanders chimes in to say taxes will go up under Medicare-for-all. \u201cWell, at least that\u2019s a straightforward answer,\u201d says Buttigieg, getting in yet another dig at Warren.\n\n26 minutes. CNN cuts to a shot of the four in the center of the stage, Biden, Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren, which is a nice compliment for Buttigieg and a dismissal of Harris, who has recently faltered in the polls. Both Klobuchar and Biden chime in to hit the same points on Warren\u2019s refusal to say what her policy would do. They score blow after blow, and in response, Warren keeps lapsing into her stump speech, talking about how the middle class has been hollowed out. Maybe this strategy worked better in high school.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n31 minutes. Sanders gives Warren a break. He attacks Biden for not backing his bill. He says 500,000 people go bankrupt every year from medical costs, a contested statistic. Then, he accuses Biden of a lack of courage. Biden smiles, but before he can respond Harris breaks the spell by changing the topic. She says its time to talk about \u201cwomen\u2019s reproductive health care.\u201d\n\n33 minutes. The resulting applause serves as a palate cleanser. But the moderators move on. Now everyone is talking about robots taking jobs. Yang disagrees with Sanders about whether the best response is more government employment or cash subsidies. But then, just as the robot conversation gets going, Booker chimes in to sayHarris is right about reproductive health care. \u201cWomen are people. And people deserve to control their own bodies,\u201d he says.\n\n37 minutes. CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett tries to get the topic back on robots and jobs. Warren talks about bad trade deals. Castro talks about infrastructure investment and a Green New Deal. Yang challenges Warren for not adopting his universal basic income plan, which would pay adults $1,000 a month. He mentions the self-driving trucks and self-serve kiosks at McDonald\u2019s. Warren responds by saying she supports increases in Social Security payments. The conversation continues for a while, with several candidates endorsing stronger unions and better trade deals.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n46 minutes. Burnett appears to try to set a trap. She asks Sanders if he thinks billionaires should be taxed into millionaire status. Steyer, a billionaire who has joined the debate stage for the first time, is just a few feet away. \u201cWe cannot afford a billionaire class,\u201d Sanders responds. But Steyer is ready. \u201cFirst of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right,\u201d he says. He flips class politics on its head and makes the case that he is as radical on economic inequality as the Democratic socialist.\n\n49 minutes. But Warren is not ready to give up the class struggle. She asks why everyone on the stage besides Sanders and herself thinks \u201cit is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\u201d Biden takes offense. \u201cNo one is supporting billionaires,\u201d he says. So does Buttigieg, who generally sounds the best in these debate settings. Here, he tries some next-level mental jujitsu. He says people in the Midwest have come to distrust politicians who focus on \u201cwho sounded better on a debate stage or in a committee hearing.\u201d\n\n53 minutes. Klobuchar does not want to lose the pile-on-Warren thread. \u201cI want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires,\u201d she says. \u201cNot even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.\u201d Warren is dismissive, without actually engaging with Klobuchar. \u201cLook, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,\u201d Warren says. Klobuchar is ready. \u201cSimply because you have different ideas doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not fighting for regular people,\u201d she says.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n57 minutes. A discussion continues about the wealth tax embraced by Warren. Yang likes the idea, but he says it has failed in lots of places. O\u2019Rourke says it is part of a solution, but worries that Warren is being \u201cpunitive.\u201d This gives Warren a chance to say she is \u201creally shocked\u201d that anyone would consider her punitive and to lapse into another part of her stump speech, where she says the wealthy got help from public infrastructure and need to \u201cpitch in\u201d to pay some of it back.\n\n63 minutes. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take a quick break,\u201d says Cooper. Only two hours left. Democracy is hard.\n\n68 minutes. We\u2019re back with foreign policy. The focus in on Trump\u2019s recent decision to pull troops out of Syria. Everyone on the stage is against either the withdrawal or the way Trump handled the withdrawal, leaving behind former Kurdish allies to face Turkish forces alone. Biden seems particularly worked up. \u201cThis is shameful, shameful what this man has done,\u201d he says.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n70 minutes. Gabbard, the only candidate who raises doubts about reports of Syrian chemical weapons use on her campaign website, scrambles the conversation by blaming the Turkish slaughter of Kurds on \u201cthe regime change war that we\u2019ve been waging.\u201d The Syrian civil war started before U.S. troops arrived, and the U.S. troops in the country were not focused on changing the Syrian regime. Gabbard goes on to say accusations that she is Russian asset are \u201ccompletely despicable.\u201d She repeats the phrase \u201cregime change war\u201d four more times.\n\n73 minutes. The other candidates work to distance themselves from Gabbard. Warren says she wants to get out of Syria but in a smarter way, and she appears to be reading talking points from a piece of paper on her podium. Buttigieg, who is delivering his most forceful debate performance of the year, calls Gabbard \u201cdead wrong.\u201d This prompts an odd exchange where Gabbard and Buttigieg debate the difference between \u201cregime change war\u201d and \u201cendless war.\u201d \u201cWhat is an endless war if it\u2019s not a regime change war?\u201d Gabbard asks.\n\n78 minutes. The discussion turns to the U.S. standing in the world and the trust of its allies. Candidates agree that Trump has not been good for either. Several also point to growing Russian geopolitical strength.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n91 minutes. Cooper changes the topic to gun violence, pitting O\u2019Rourke and Buttigieg against each other. O\u2019Rourke wants a mandatory buyback of assault weapons, although he offers only vague notions of how it will be enforced. Buttigieg thinks the proposal could prevent other new gun regulations from becoming law by polarizing the debate. The back and forth gets a bit nasty. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg says to O\u2019Rourke, who responds by saying Buttigieg\u2019s position is a \u201cslap in the face\u201d to gun violence survivor groups. The other candidates also weigh in on guns.\n\n105 minutes. The topic changes to opioid policy. Several candidates say they support strong enforcement against pharmaceutical companies that flooded the market with drugs. Yang and O\u2019Rourke says they support decriminalizing small amounts of opiates. When O\u2019Rourke says marijuana should be legalized, Yang chimes in. \u201cYes. Preach, Beto,\u201d he says.\n\n112 minutes. Sanders, 78, gets a question about his age and his health, given the heart attack. He answers by bragging about his youthful allies. \u201cWell, let me invite you all to a major rally we\u2019re having in Queens, New York,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a special guest at that event.\u201d The guest is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), 30, who, The Washington Post later reports, will be endorsing him at the rally. Sanders also thanks all the well-wishers during his illness. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to be back here with you this evening,\u201d he says.\n\n115 minutes. Biden, 76, responds to the age question by saying his experience is one of his best qualities. Warren, 70, basically dares anyone to keep up with her. \u201cI will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone,\u201d she says.\n\n119 minutes. Gabbard, 38, gets the age question and answers by saying that as a military veteran she is ready to be commander in chief. Then she tries to ask Warren to justify her qualifications to lead the military, but the moderators cut her off and go to another commercial break.\n\n124 minutes. And we\u2019re back. The topic is big tech and whether companies like Facebook and Amazon need to be broken up. Most are leaning that way, although the details differ somewhat. Warren is particularly bothered by Amazon\u2019s ability to gather information from vendors on its network and then use that information to compete with those vendors. \u201cLook, you get to be the umpire in the baseball game, or you get to have a team, but you don\u2019t get to do both at the same time,\u201d she says.\n\n132 minutes. Harris takes a question about Facebook and turns it into a question for Warren about Twitter. She asks Warren to join her in demanding that Twitter suspend Trump\u2019s account for violating the rules. Like other platforms, Twitter tends to give public officials more leeway to be abusive. \u201cNo,\u201d says Warren. \u201cNo? Wow,\u201d says Harris, looking shocked. \u201cYou can\u2019t say you\u2019re for corporate responsibility if it doesn\u2019t apply to everyone.\u201d\n\n139 minutes. The previously scheduled reproductive health section of the evening arrives. The candidates support reproductive health and are unhappy with the Trump administration.\n\n145 minutes. Buttigieg has spent much of the night telling other candidates that they are too polarizing, but now he revels in the fact that he was the first candidate to prominently embrace the idea of overhauling the Supreme Court to prevent a conservative majority. \u201cSome folks said that was too bold to even contemplate,\u201d he brags. He hasn\u2019t settled on how he would \u201cdepoliticize\u201d the court, but options include term limits, rotating justices off and increasing the number from 9 to 15. Castro and Warren say they are interested in the ideas.\n\n149 minutes. Biden gets a question about whether his platform is bold enough. He boasts of all he has accomplished and pivots to attack Warren and Sanders. \u201cBoth are being vague on the issue of Medicare-for-all,\u201d he says, trying to bring back the argument from earlier. Sanders is happy to oblige, listing off some of Biden\u2019s less popular accomplishments. \u201cYou got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA,\u201d he says.\n\n152 minutes. Rather than respond on Medicare-for-all, Warren begins listing off all the things she got done while working in the Obama administration fighting for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This leads Biden to praise her. \u201cI agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes,\u201d Biden says.\n\n153 minutes. Warren can\u2019t manage to return the compliment, at least not directly. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it,\u201d she says.\n\n154 minutes. Buttigieg does the meta-thing that politicians do when they want to make it look like they are not politicians, calling the debate between Biden and Warren a \u201cfalse choice.\u201d \u201cIf I had a buck for every argument that I\u2019ve witnessed like this, I could pay for college for everybody,\u201d he says, delivering what is clearly a rehearsed line. \u201cWe need to move past what has been consuming this whole political space for as long as I\u2019ve been alive.\u201d\n\n156 minutes. Klobuchar weighs in to say bold doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t win, and she knows how to win in the Midwest.\n\n157 minutes. Cooper asks Sanders why his approach is more likely to beat Trump. \u201cHere\u2019s the radical reason,\u201d says Sanders. \u201cIt\u2019s what the American people want.\u201d This is not yet clear.\n\n160 minutes. A final break. Almost there.\n\n165 minutes. And we\u2019re back. The final question is for everyone. Each candidate is asked to talk about a surprising friendship. Castro talks vaguely about people he has known who are different from him. Gabbard talks about her friendship with former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.). Klobuchar talks about former senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), who died last year. \u201cI miss him every day,\u201d she says. Steyer talks about a woman he met in South Carolina who is fighting for cleaner water. O\u2019Rourke talks about his former colleague Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.). Booker talks about bible study in the office of Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.). Yang talks about a Trump-voting trucker he met and turned into a supporter. Harris talks about Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). Buttigieg talks about the friends he met serving in Afghanistan. Sanders talks about Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). Warren talks about Charles Fried, a Republican solicitor general who helped her get a job. Biden talks about McCain as well.", "description": "Twelve candidates, three hours and a wide-ranging exchange on issues domestic and foreign.", "authors": ["Michael Scherer", "National Political Reporter Covering Campaigns", "Congress", "The White House"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MDZICpOPZsnycGlQ24lNVJiIHnM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V2XVJIHPXAI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
