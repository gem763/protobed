REUTERS/Mohamed Azakir\n\nSaad al-Hariri also said the policy of keeping stable the Lebanese pound, which is pegged to the dollar, would continue.\n\nCabinet ministers, politicians and lawmakers who met on Monday reached consensus on an outline for a plan that would put public finances and the economy on a more sustainable path, Hariri said.\n\n\u201cThere is agreement to announce a state of economic emergency,\u201d Hariri said.\n\n\u201cThis difficult economic situation requires us taking speedy measures such as finishing the budget on time and reducing the deficit\u201d Hariri told reporters after the meeting that President Michel Aoun also attended to address a worsening economic situation.\n\nThe government would hold more meetings to speed up the work, he said.\n\nLebanon is grappling with one of the world\u2019s heaviest public debt burdens at 150% of GDP and years of low economic growth.\n\nGovernment finances, plagued by corruption and waste, are strained by a bloated public sector, debt-servicing costs and subsidizing the state power producer.\n\nHariri said accelerating reforms would avoid a crisis similar to Greece, which fell into a debt crisis nine years ago and had to adopt tough austerity measures under tight supervision by foreign creditors.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want this to happen to us. So we are taking measures to save the country,\u201d the prime minister said.\n\nHariri said Lebanon\u2019s credit rating downgrade by Fitch to CCC 10 days ago was a warning to take the needed measures to shore investor confidence before it was late.\n\nFitch said its downgrade from B- reflected \u201cintensifying pressure on Lebanon\u2019s financing model and increasing risks to the government\u2019s debt servicing capacity.\u201d\n\nLebanese leaders have warned of a financial crisis without changes. The impetus to enact reforms has grown with the slowdown of deposits into Lebanon\u2019s banking sector, a critical source of finance for the state.", "description": "Lebanon will declare an economic emergency and the government has begun work on a plan to accelerate public finance reforms, its prime minister said on Monday.", "authors": ["Suleiman Al-Khalidi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425509500&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF811KM"}
