(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nJust this week, the same people who insisted that Trump would never collude with a foreign nation for his political interest are now defending collusion with a foreign nation for his political interest.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason people think President Trump has a cult of personality, but it may not be the reason you think.\n\nYes, there are those who think Trump was delivered to us by God and that his decisions and actions are imbued with divine providence and authority. But that sort of stuff is taking the word \u201ccult\u201d too literally. It harkens back to pre-Enlightenment notions like the divine right of kings, the Roman imperial cults, or the Chinese mandate of heaven \u2014 which were mainstream, not cultish, beliefs anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs with so many words and ideas, \u201ccult of personality\u201d in the modern sense probably begins with Karl Marx, who used \u201cpersonality cult\u201d in a letter to a friend in 1877. Nikita Khrushchev cited that passage (and several later ones by Marx) in his famous 1956 \u201csecret speech,\u201d formally titled \u201cOn the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences.\u201d That address began the \u201cde-Stalinization\u201d of the Soviet Union and the de-escalation of Stalin\u2019s terror.\n\nBefore I go on, let me state unequivocally that Trump isn\u2019t Stalin. He\u2019s not even close.\n\nKhrushchev\u2019s speech was monumentally important for numerous reasons, but I\u2019m going to focus on the part that\u2019s relevant to my point. In Marxist lingo, \u201ccult of personality\u201d is synonymous with \u201ccult of the individual\u201d \u2014 indeed, Khrushchev used the phrases interchangeably in his speech. Both terms refer to the idea that a single person can be greater than the party, or wiser than the ideology the party stands for. Think: \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201d Such a mindset is a threat to the power of the party and the legitimacy of its doctrines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStalin didn\u2019t care. He encouraged, often through murder and terror, the idea that his judgment trumped any other authority or doctrine. He was infallible.\n\nAnd it worked. During Khrushchev\u2019s speech, delivered to the cream of the Communist-party leadership, some members of the audience grew physically ill and had to leave the room \u2014 it was that alien to their ears to hear Stalin criticized. There\u2019s still a cult of Stalin in Russian. One might even say that Vladimir Putin is its high priest.\n\nOf course, having dictatorial control over a country and possessing the will to murder and terrorize tens of millions makes it easier to cultivate a cult of personality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of that has much relevance to American politics today. But there\u2019s a simpler reason for a cult of personality: It\u2019s the only sustainable line of defense. Stalin violated party ideology all the time. He contradicted his past positions cavalierly, adopting and discarding ideas on a whim. He would even change his views to test his loyalists. Today, insist that chocolate ice cream is the best flavor and get everyone to agree with you. That way, if anyone disagrees tomorrow when you say it\u2019s vanilla, you\u2019ll know who the potential traitors in your midst are.\n\nThis is where Trump\u2019s cult of personality comes in. For several years there\u2019s been a kind of competition on the right to come up with a coherent intellectual or ideological framework to support Trump\u2019s presidency. Every single one that comes out of the clouds of theory to get close to the reality on the ground has crashed. He\u2019s a nationalist who puts America first but says we\u2019ll await Saudi Arabia\u2019s say-so on a military strike against Iran. He says he wants free trade but also thinks tariffs are good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust this week, the same people who insisted that Trump would never collude with a foreign nation for his political interest are now defending collusion with a foreign nation for his political interest. The people who turn crimson with rage when you point out Trump\u2019s decades of corrupt business practices now insist his only interest in the Bidens is his concern about corruption. They say it\u2019s outrageous that Biden\u2019s son sat on the board of a Ukrainian company when Biden was vice president, but they also say it\u2019s fine to have a daughter and son-in-law duo running vast swaths of foreign and domestic policy while also making a fortune from their business interests around the world. Enemies are sinful or decadent when they lie or cheat on their wives, but who are you to judge Comrade Trump?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s no halfway defensible ideological, intellectual, or moral standard that Trump doesn\u2019t violate, often routinely. A cult of personality that replies \u201cTrump\u2019s right\u201d or \u201chis enemies are worse\u201d before the question is even asked is the only place to hide.\n\nA doctrine of infallibility is the only defense of this deeply fallible man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00a9 2019 TRIBUNE CONTENT AGENCY LLC", "description": "Just this week, the same people who insisted that Trump would never collude with a foreign nation for his political interest are now defending collusion with foreign nation for his political interest.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Andrew C.
