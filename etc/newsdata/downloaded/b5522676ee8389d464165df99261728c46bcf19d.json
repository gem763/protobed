Stock go down, investor... sad?\n\nProbably. In fact, we'd go so far as to say that's probably the ordinary reaction an investor has to a decline in the share price of a stock he or she owns -- but not all the time.\n\nYou see, if the stock is question is a dividend stock, even a decline in stock price can be offset by the value of the dividend you're being paid to own it. What's more, because a stock's dividend yield is calculated by dividing the dividend amount by the stock price, the lower the stock price falls, the bigger the dividend yield becomes -- making the stock increasingly attractive to other dividend investors, and providing a backstop that can prevent the stock falling further!\n\nSo how do you find great dividend stocks, popular on Wall Street, and attractive to dividend investors?\n\nUsing the Stock Screener at TipRanks, you can screen for stocks rated \"strong buy\" by Wall Street analysts, and screen, too, for stocks paying better-than-average dividend yields. Combine these two attributes, and voila! You've got a great dividend stock candidate. Here are three of them:\n\nSanofi (SNY)\n\nOne of Europe's largest drugmakers, Paris-based Sanofi boasts a market capitalization north of $112 billion, more than $40 billion in annual sales, and net profits approaching $4 billion. Sanofi stock's a great cash generator as well, throwing off nearly $6.3 billion in cash over the last 12 months, enabling it to pay a market-beating dividend yield of 3.9%.\n\nJust recently, Morgan Stanley analyst Mark Purcell upgraded Sanofi shares to \"overweight,\" calling the stock a \"defensive\" play in an uncertain market. According to Purcell, the stock is \"largely de-risked\" -- indeed, the analyst says Sanofi has the lowest risk growth outlook of any European Big Pharma stock, due to a lack of big drugs losing patent protection in the near future (the dreaded \"patent cliff\"), and a pipeline of new drugs in late-stage clinical trials that could soon come to market.\n\nWhereas the consensus on Wall Street is that Sanofi stock is worth $52 per share, Purcell thinks Sanofi could go all the way to ... $98 a share! (To watch Purcell's track record, click here)\n\n\"We argue that new CEO Paul Hudson inherits significant optionality to unlock shareholder value alongside the recent CFO and CSO appointments. The management team can draw on their shared experience from the strategic transformations of AstraZeneca and Novartis, the new chapter of innovation at Roche and the cost discipline of Peugeot. The evolution of the GSK equity story, with which Sanofi has much in common, albeit with greater balance sheet flexibility and lower patent risk, offers a further yardstick for investors, we believe. We explore potential strategic options that could in theory help to close the 15% relative P/E multiple discount,\" Purcell said.\n\nSanofi stock hasn't moved much over the past year, up less than 4%. Regardless, Wall Street loves Sanofi stock, rating it \"strong buy\" on average, and with a $52 price target implying 14.5% upside from today's prices. Factor in the dividend, and you're pushing 18.5% potential profit. (See Sanofi stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\nMerck (MRK)\n\nBut you needn't travel all the way to Europe to find an attractive drug stock paying a big dividend. Right here at home, Kenilworth, New Jersey-based Merck & Co. pays its shareholders a very respectable 2.7% dividend yield. (The average stock on the S&P 500 is only paying 2%).", "description": "Stock go up, investor happy. Stock go down, investor... sad?Probably.
