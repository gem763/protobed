Orthosomnia was coined in 2017 by University of Chicago. The researcher said there are growing number of patients who are seeking treatment for self-diagnosed sleep disturbances. They might feel they have insufficient sleep duration or insomnia due to periods of light or restless sleep observed on their sleep tracker data. People become fixated on improving their recorded sleep data in the 'quest to achieve perfect sleep'. 'Ortho' means straight or correct, and 'somnia' means sleep. The researchers said the goal to get perfect sleep is 'similar to the unhealthy preoccupation with healthy eating, termed orthorexia.'\n\nCalled orthosomnia, this condition is may well be worsened by people trying out new products to reach some optimal state of restfulness.\n\nTrying to get better could, in many cases, be making a person worse.\n\nEarlier this year, one woman reported that using sleep tracking software had inadvertently reduced her nightly rest from eight hours to just four.\n\nCBT apps don't just address insomnia but help manage orthosomnia as well.\n\nThere are a number of other options besides Sleepio, including Somryst and CBT-I Coach, a tool from the US Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\n'Within just a couple of sessions, I was sleeping better,' writes Jee.\n\n'I'm no longer obsessing over the number of hours I've slept. In fact, I no longer even know how many hours I'm sleeping. All the trackers are gathering dust in the drawer.'", "description": "Sleep tracking devices can often lead to dysfunction as users obsess over getting a perfect night of sleep.
