LOUIS (AP) - St. Louis manager Mike Shildt tried to find the right words to describe Jack Flaherty\u2019s one-hit effort over eight innings.\n\n\u201cHe was stellar. He was impressive,\u201d Shildt said. \u201cYou can throw a lot of superlatives out there about his performance.\u201d\n\nFlaherty dazzled in another dominant performance, Marcell Ozuna homered and the Cardinals - with a fluky foul ball-turned-base hit - beat the San Francisco Giants 1-0 Tuesday night.\n\nFlaherty (9-7) carried a no-hitter into the sixth inning and cruised with eight strikeouts and a walk. The 23-year-old right-hander threw a career-high 113 pitches, 84 for strikes, and lowered his ERA to 0.90 over his past 11 starts dating to July 7.\n\n\u201cI was in rhythm with Yadi (Molina) all day,\u201d Flaherty said. \u201cI had three pitches for strikes. I\u2019ve been preaching execution.\u201d\n\nHe faced 26 hitters and threw just 29 balls.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s kind of crazy,\u201d Flaherty said. \u201cI don\u2019t think about how many strikes I\u2019m throwing. I just try to fill up the zone and get ahead of guys. It\u2019s more fun to be ahead of guys.\u201d\n\nMike Yastrzemski had San Francisco\u2019s only two hits, the first a soft line drive with two outs in the sixth, and the second a single off closer Carlos Martinez in the ninth.\n\n\u201cI saw it early and I just wasn\u2019t going to get fooled by a pitch that was handleable,\u201d Yastrzemski said about breaking up the no-hitter. \u201cJust tried to be nice and easy and not do too much and get it to find some grass somewhere. He pitched well tonight. Had command of all his stuff and kept everybody off balance.\u201d\n\nSt. Louis only had five hits, including one by Paul DeJong that looked like a trick pool shot. DeJong hit a ball that rolled about 10 feet foul of the first base line before spinning all the way back into fair territory roughly 3/4 of the way to the bag. DeJong raced to first to load the bases with two outs in the first.\n\nShildt said he had seen a hit like DeJong\u2019s before.\n\n\u201cI appreciated Paul\u2019s attention to that play,\u201d Shildt said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it down the third-base line and the guy just gives up on it and a good player, a guy who\u2019s always going to give effort. Paul was aware of it like boom. A heads-up play on his part.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco manager Bruce Bochy laughed when asked about it.\n\n\u201cThat was unbelievable,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that on a pool table.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco right-hander Dereck Rodriguez pitched out of the inning and was nearly as good as Flaherty. Rodriguez (5-8) struck out seven over seven innings, and St. Louis\u2019 only damage came on Ozuna\u2019s shot in the sixth.\n\n\u201cIt was just a curveball that didn\u2019t too much and he made me pay,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\nIt was Ozuna\u2019s 10th solo homer of the season, his 18th go-ahead RBI and his team-leading 13th game-winning RBI.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working on my swing and I feel like I\u2019m getting it going,\u201d Ozuna said.\n\nMartinez stranded Yastrzemski for his 18th save in 21 chances.\n\nSt. Louis has won 20 of its last 25 games. The Cardinals are an NL-best 34-16 since the All-Star break and entered the game leading the NL Central by three games.\n\nSan Francisco has lost seven of its last eight. The Giants were shutout for the 12th time this season. It was their third 1-0 loss.\n\nJUMPING JACK FLASH\n\nShildt had high praise for Flaherty before the game after learning he\u2019d won NL pitcher of the month for August.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of him,\u201d Shildt said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anybody more prepared or more sincere about their dedication to their career and so mature with it so early in their career.\u201d\n\nIN THE HOUSE\n\nSt. Louis Blues coach Craig Berube and his assistant coaches sat in the stands for the game. The Blues won their first Stanley Cup in June.\n\nRECALLED\n\nSt. Louis recalled OF Randy Arozarena from Triple-A Memphis.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nGiants: RHP Johnny Cueto threw a bullpen Tuesday before the game. Cueto has missed the entire season while recovering from Tommy John surgery. After the game, Bochy said Cueto sustained back tightness and the club will wait \u201ca day or two\u201d to see how he feels.\n\nCardinals: C Matt Wieters went to the doctor to get a cortisone shot for a mild calf strain but it was determined he did not need one. There is no timetable for his return.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGiants: Madison Bumgarner (9-8, 3.62) is 4-5 in 11 career starts against the Cardinals. He faced St. Louis in July and was forced to leave after the second inning after Jose Martinez slammed a line drive off the top his pitching elbow in the first inning.\n\nCardinals: RHP Michael Wacha (6-6, 5.07) will be making his first appearance against the Giants since the 2017 season. His 1.50 career ERA versus the Giants is his lowest against any National League opponent.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "St. Louis manager Mike Shildt tried to find the right words to describe Jack Flaherty's one-hit effort over eight innings.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Warren Mayes"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/giants_cardinals_baseball_55377_c0-197-4711-2943_s1770x1032.jpg?71fc5f5a6c56cd1ab299d1afadfd1f7b195a8c36"}
