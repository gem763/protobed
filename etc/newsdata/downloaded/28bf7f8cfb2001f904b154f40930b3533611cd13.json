Most of us, glued to phone screens, in our own world as we amble along the pavement, would be surprised by what we notice simply by glancing up.\n\nWe might think of London\u2019s 2,000 years of history as hiding below ground, ruins, tunnels and sewers. But we should also remember that plenty of our heritage is written into the fabric of buildings that still line our streets.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s an architectural detail that affords a clue to a past function, or a faded sign that hints at old traditions. It might be a sculpture or etched name that reveals previous residents, but on every street across the capital there are stories to discover. If you\u2019re not looking up, you\u2019re missing out.", "description": "", "authors": ["Katie Wignall"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2018/July/london-iStock-814671954-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
