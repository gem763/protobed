Ovenright, Apple added four new games to the Apple Arcade service, including the new game, Pilgrims, from Machinarium developer Amanita Design and the early release of The Bradwell Conspiracy.\n\nIt seems Pilgrims was a complete surprise, being announced and released all at once. It\u2019s described as a \u201cplayful adventure game\u201d where players will have to explore and meet new characters, helping them and learning about their stories. The art style looks lovely. Pilgrims is also now available for PC.\n\nThe Bradwell Conspiracy is a first-person puzzle game with a big focus on telling a story. Following a large explosion at the Stonehedge Museum, you are trapped underground in a secret complex. You have to unravel the secrets of this complex and escape with the help of another survivor. This game was planned to release on Oct. 8, but was released a little early on Apple Arcade. It will still be released in a few days for PS4, Xbox One, PC and Switch.\n\nRedOut: Space Assault is a dogfighting game featuring cool-looking spaceships. The game has a full career mode with ship upgrades and various ways to control your starfighter. You can kill the engines to slow your speed, making it easier to navigate a small opening. RedOut: Space Assault is also coming to PC, though no release date is listed on Steam.\n\nFinally, Nightmare Farm is the new game from the developers behind Neko Atsume: Kitty Collector. Nightmare Farm is described as \u201cThe story of a painful nightmare spinning in a bright world.\u201d Not entirely sure what that means, but players will have to grow and harvest crops while also preparing meals for visitors to keep them happy.\n\nChecking out each game\u2019s publishers and developers, only some of them have formally announced the new releases. I assume, over the next few hours and days, more formal announcements and trailers will launch for these games and their Apple Arcade debut. But hopefully, future additions to Apple Arcade will be handled a bit better and not feel so sloppy and poorly done.", "description": "Surprise!
