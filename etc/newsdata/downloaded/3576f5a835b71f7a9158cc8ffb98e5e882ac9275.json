(Not unfortunate: Lauren and Maggie possibly \u201crekindling\u201d their relationship \u2014 the only recycled storyline I\u2019m on board with at the moment.) It\u2019s because, um, let me check my notes here, oh yes: CHARLES PROPOSED TO LIZA.\n\nThere I was, still catching my breath from Charles inviting Liza on a vacation that included a HARRY POTTER TOUR, when he goes and requests \u201cTake My Breath Away\u201d at Diana\u2019s wedding (you may recall that back in season three, Charles and Liza danced to that song in the Hamptons before promptly smashing their faces together), asks Liza to dance, tells her that he\u2019s only fallen deeper in love with her and cannot live without her, and then gosh dang asks Liza Miller to take him, Charles Brooks, as her lawful wedded husband. Of course I stood up! I was ready for Liza to break that nice, tall man\u2019s heart right there in the middle of the dance floor. But in a fate possibly worse (for us) than an outright no, Liza\u2019s unable to answer and we\u2019re left to imagine how this romantic entanglement is going to shake out for a truly lengthy hiatus. Yes or no, Charles better go on that fucking Harry Potter tour and there better be photos.\n\nThere are three reasons Liza is unable to answer Charles right away. First, there\u2019s a physical barrier created when everyone starts dancing to \u201cWe Are Family\u201d and Liza is surrounded by wedding guests having the time of their lives. Has Liza ever been so thankful for cheesy wedding music? Let\u2019s be honest, if she had really been into the proposal, she could\u2019ve yelled \u201cyes, yes, one thousand times yes\u201d across that dance floor and that giant stud would\u2019ve airlifted her out. But she does not say anything, and being saved by a vertically endowed dreamboat on a wedding dance floor will have to remain a mere fantasy.\n\nAnother thing getting in the way of this proposal is Kelsey. At the start of \u201cForever,\u201d Kelsey is adamant about leaving Millennial. She leaves her letter of resignation on Charles\u2019s desk and informs Liza of her decision. Liza\u2019s done a lot of selfish things on this show, but running away from Kelsey to try and steal her letter before Charles sees it is a new low. I mean, let the woman make her own choices! When Liza wanted to leave Millennial, Kelsey was very upset about it, but she knew Liza had to do what was best for her and they had a good cry in the lobby of a Frankfurt hotel and that was that. Thankfully, Liza\u2019s plan to thwart Kelsey\u2019s resignation falls to pieces since apparently Liza, a woman mostly known for lying, is actually terrible at lying. Charles catches her in the act, and while she fumbles around for a cover story about what she\u2019s doing in his office, Kelsey comes in and tells Charles in person: She\u2019s leaving and there\u2019s no offer he can make to get her to stay. Their hug is very cute!\n\nKelsey\u2019s plan is to start her own company, but she\u2019s finding that thanks to her meme and lack of funding, it might be impossible. She meets with Zane to get his business advice, which is \u201cdon\u2019t do it,\u201d and it ends up turning into a rehashing of their breakup. Zane\u2019s heartbroken that Kelsey wouldn\u2019t let him be there for her, that when things are going poorly career-wise, she refuses to be in a relationship. He tells her that when she decides she wants more out of life, she should tell him. I really hope these two dummies work it out because I honestly don\u2019t want to see either of them with anyone else. Be in love, please!\n\nKelsey heads to Liza\u2019s for advice, but runs into Maggie instead (yes, it\u2019s weird). Maggie reminds Kelsey to believe in herself and also that sometimes to get what you want you have to \u201cget in bed with the devil.\u201d This piece of advice (Mags is always hit or miss on the advice front) leads Kelsey to the boardroom of none other than Quinn Tyler. As terrible as Quinn is, she apparently does not harbor grudges, and is into Kelsey\u2019s resilience. This is happening (again), people!\n\nWell, until Charles hears about it. He knows Kelsey wants to own something that\u2019s hers and when he sits down next to her before Diana\u2019s wedding, he makes her a pretty tempting offer: She built Millennial, and he\u2019ll give her enough shares to make her ownership official \u2014 shares that come with a seat on the board. It\u2019s a family-owned company, and Kelsey is family. He wants her to \u201ccome back home.\u201d She\u2019ll think about it, probably because Charles doesn\u2019t once mention how fabulous her metallic dress and matching headband are. I mean, that\u2019s why I would hesitate on an offer like that.\n\nThis wedding is supposed to be about celebrating Diana and Enzo, but it\u2019s honestly a great day for Kelsey. Not only does she get that huge job offer, but when Zane arrives at her side during the ceremony, she grabs his hand\u2014she wants more, she wants him\u2014and just like that, those two are back on. He probably tells her her dress is perfect later. I\u2019d assume.\n\nBut the celebrating isn\u2019t over for Kelsey Peters! She has an answer for Charles, and she decides to let him know just as he\u2019s asked Liza to marry him. \u201cI do!\u201d Kelsey yells, not realizing what she\u2019s just interrupted. I WILL FORGIVE HER BUT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE DRESS. Okay, and the hand-holding with Zane. You guys, it was so cute and I\u2019m really rooting for them.\n\nLiza\u2019s probably thankful for the interruption and that is because of the third and final reason she hesitates to give Charles an answer: Josh. You didn\u2019t think Josh wouldn\u2019t be playing a part in this whole proposal thing, did you? The love triangle looms! Josh is at Diana\u2019s wedding as Lauren\u2019s plus-one, but also to see Liza. He doesn\u2019t like how they ended things\u2014I mean, I\u2019m still traumatized!\u2014and he wants to ask her if she\u2019s okay with Infinitely 21 licensing the hourglass tattoo Josh gave her when they were together for the Inkburg collaboration. After some thought, she decides she\u2019s not okay with it. It belongs to them, to her.\n\nObviously, Josh is thrilled with this decision because he knows it means what we all know it means: She\u2019s not over Josh. She\u2019s clearly thinking about Josh as \u201cTake My Breath Away\u201d comes on and Charles takes her out on the dance floor. This is all extremely exhausting and I might not even care who she ends up with anymore because GET A GRIP, LADY. At least with a proposal on the table, Liza will have to make a real choice in season seven. I mean, unless we\u2019re headed for Liza leaving Charles at the altar, which like, don\u2019t put that past her.\n\nIt\u2019s Trout Season\n\n\u2022 Honestly, I wanted so much more for Queen Trout\u2019s wedding\u2014we didn\u2019t even get vows to make me weep into a pillow? What kind of wedding is this?!\u2014but Diana and Enzo both look so happy, it\u2019s hard to be disappointed for too long. You guys, he bought her a giant statement necklace as a wedding gift. They are truly meant for each other!\n\n\u2022 Okay, at least we got Uncle Joe and his \u201cTrout Jumping Out of a Toilet\u201d ice sculpture present. Enzo\u2019s godfather (lowercase \u2018g\u2019) is a treasure and I do hope one day Maggie gets his frozen works in a gallery. All the good things for Uncle Joe!\n\n\u2022 Diana and Liza meet with Redmond, our one, true (only) agent, who takes some pretty hard digs at Millennial now that Kelsey\u2019s left and the imprint is being run by, well, not millennials. Although, he does stop short of insulting Diana. He knows she\u2019s a queen to be treasured and calls her \u201cageless.\u201d She still takes it as an insult, though: She think it sounds like he\u2019s describing \u201ca carpet for high traffic areas.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Obviously, the star of the episode is Diana\u2019s wedding gown (see also: her hair), but can we acknowledge her pink and purple suit situation? It deserves a moment.\n\n\u2022 Yes, Diana\u2019s eye does twitch every time someone calls her \u201cMrs. DeLuca\u201d and it isn\u2019t lost on Enzo. See? Meant for each other!\n\n\u2022 No big deal, still tearing up thinking about Diana and Liza\u2019s tearful scene in the car before Diana walks into the church. THOSE TWO ARE MY FAVORITE TWO.\n\n\u2022 \u201cHow can you be so bad at this maid of honor stuff? You\u2019re a thousand years old, this can\u2019t be your first rodeo.\u201d I will never tire of Diana making digs at Liza\u2019s age. NEVER.", "description": "Diana and Enzo\u2019s big day turns out to be a pretty big day for Kelsey and Liza as well.
