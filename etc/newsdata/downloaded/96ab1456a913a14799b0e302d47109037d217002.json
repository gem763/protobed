The tornado, deemed \u201clife-threatening\u201d by Fort Worth\u2019s National Weather Service, struck on the north side of the city, lifting debris 20,000 feet into the air, producing significant damage and knocking out power to tens of thousands of people with evidence showing winds in the 140-mph range. There were no reports of fatalities or missing people as of Monday evening.\n\n\u201cConsidering the path that the storm took, it went across a pretty densely populated part of our city, we should consider ourselves pretty fortunate that we didn\u2019t lose any lives, no fatalities, and no serious injuries,\u201d Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson said Monday (via the Capital Weather Gang). \u201cProperty damage, we\u2019re not concerned about that. \u2026 We\u2019ve dealt with [that] before. Our number one priority is that people are safe.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGiven the severity of the storm, NBC realized it erred by waiting to interrupt the game for six minutes, precious time when a tornado is on the ground.\n\n\u201cDuring Sunday night\u2019s Dallas Cowboys game, we made a mistake by not immediately interrupting the football game with a Tornado Warning,\u201d the station said in a statement. \u201cAlthough our meteorologists were tracking thunderstorms across the area when the National Weather Service issued a Tornado Warning for Dallas County, we delayed breaking into programming for six minutes. Our meteorologists were also streaming live weather coverage throughout the evening on our site, NBCDFW.com. We also alerted the football audience to our weather live stream throughout the game.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to dealing with severe weather, we know that seconds matter. We should have broken into football programming sooner. We apologize and want you to know that we\u2019re doing everything in our power to make sure this does not happen again. We look forward to regaining your trust, and anyone who we may have disappointed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith a 37-10 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, the Cowboys broke a three-game losing streak and improved to 4-3. Fans were watching nervously, their anxiety compounded by what was happening in the skies.\n\nI admit I\u2019m flipping back between Channel 11 and NBC5 because of the tornado. I might\u2019ve missed it. But does NBC just pretend this tornado in Dallas isn\u2019t happening? #cowboysvseagles #cowboys pic.twitter.com/KkYeIAlUT0 \u2014 Dave Lieber, CSP (@DaveLieber) October 21, 2019\n\nWe don't want to interrupt the Cowboys game on NBC 5, but @RickMitchellWX wants to keep you ahead of the storm.
