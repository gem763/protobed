Once inside, he was brutally killed and dismembered by Saudi state agents, according to a United Nations report. His remains have never been located.\n\nKhashoggi's killing touched off worldwide condemnation for Salman, the young ruler who had been viewed by Western nations as a progressive visionary in the deeply conservative kingdom.\n\nThe crown prince did not take responsibility for planning Khashoggi's killing, nor did he admit that he had prior knowledge of it.\n\nWhen pressed on how it could happen without him knowing or giving the OK, he responded: \"We have 20 million people. We have 3 million government employees.\"\n\nSmith pushed back, asking if those government officials had authority to take one of the crown prince's planes from Saudi Arabia to Turkey.\n\n\"I have officials, ministers to follow things, and they're responsible. They have the authority to do that,\" Salman said.\n\nFollowing Khashoggi's killing last October, Saudi Arabia initially denied any involvement.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mohammed al-Shaikh/AFP/Getty Images Mohammed al-Shaikh/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs NPR reported in June, a special U.N. investigator found Salman should be investigated based on \"credible evidence\" that the crown prince and others were culpable.\n\n\"Evidence points to the 15-person mission to execute Mr. Khashoggi requiring significant government coordination, resources and finances,\" the report found, adding, \"Saudi high-level officials planned, oversaw and/or endorsed the mission.\"\n\nCritics of the Trump administration say the U.S. government has not acted swiftly or forcefully enough against the Saudi government.\n\nIn July, a little more than a month after the U.N. report, President Trump vetoed a series of legislative measures aimed at blocking weapons sales to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions on 17 Saudi nationals for their \"role in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.\"\n\n\"The United States continues to diligently work to ascertain all of the facts and will hold accountable each of those we find responsible in order to achieve justice for Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e, children, and the family he leaves behind,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.\n\nThe crown prince was not one of the Saudi individuals sanctioned by the U.S.\n\nAs NPR's Jackie Northam reported at the time, the U.S. sanctions came on the heels of Saudi Arabia's top prosecutor announcing the death penalty for five Saudis connected to the journalist's killing.\n\nA trial for 11 men accused of killing Khashoggi got underway in January and has largely taken place in Saudi Arabia outside the public view.", "description": "In an interview that appears in an upcoming PBS documentary, Mohammed bin Salman denies he had prior knowledge of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.", "authors": ["Brakkton Booker"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/26/gettyimages-1052816394_wide-7d3c5ddc549bc5e150b61ddfeb355b07fc5488de.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
