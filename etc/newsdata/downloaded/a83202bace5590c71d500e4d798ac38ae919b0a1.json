Optimization of fibrous Raw material in different proportion to get the desired quality of pulp without compromising the parameter of the end product.\n\n3. Carrying out oxygen delignification on pilot scale basis in the lab to check the quality of pulp for bleaching like Kappa No., Brightness, Viscosity & characteristic of the effluent generated.\n\n4. Study on the quality of ClO2 & imported pulp received by giving mechanical action (PFI mill) to enhance properties of the fibre.\n\n5. Fiber classification of the pulp on Buer Mc net fiber classifier to check out the retention of fiber on specific screen size and generation of fines so as to minimize fiber loss during papermaking.\n\n6. Bleaching study of pulp to optimize chemical doses in the bleaching process and checking the environment load of the effluent generated.\n\n7. Monitor water holding capacity of pulp before and after mechanical treatment at Tissue machines by Schopper Reigler freeness tester.\n\n8. Determining Chemical Oxygen demand of unbleached pulp from Post ODL process to ensure the efficiency of washing during the process.\n\n9. Moisture determination of all Fibrous Raw material received to arrive at ADMT weight.\n\n10.

Analysis of AOX in the Effluent samples as well as discharge according to the guideline of MPPCB and CPCB.\n\n15. Analysis of pH, C.O.D, B.O.D, S.S, Colour, Chloride, T.D.S, on a daily basis to fulfill the norm of PCB according to standard methods.\n\n16. Checking on a monthly basis the piezo samples received from nearby locations to ensure the quality of groundwater.\n\n17. Analysis of important parameters of soil samples like Ca, Mg, Na & SAR value to check the health of the soil of the nearby area. 18. Analysis of treated water used in HRTS.\n\nWe have seen an increase in allocation of equity shares holdings by Principal Trustee Co.Pvt.Ltd. from 0.65% to 2.52% and by L & T Mutual Fund Trustee Limited from 3.41% to 5.06% for the year ended.\n\nOrient Paper Mills gets a substantial amount of revenue from exports and we expect them to benefit from weaker rupee which is hovering around 72 per Dollar.\n\nTaking the given points into consideration we expect a strong breakout on the positive direction and yield 20% returns within 3 months time horizon.\n\nThe stock is currently range-bound around rupee 30 per share.\n\ntarget - \u20b936 within 3 months.\n\nWe have already seen a strong rally in large-cap paper industry stocks and expect Orient paper and mills to join the party soon.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Yash Shah covering: Orient Paper and Industries Ltd.
