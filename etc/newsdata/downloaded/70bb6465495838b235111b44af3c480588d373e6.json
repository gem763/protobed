(HarperCollins Canada)\n\nIn Bezmozgis's short story collection Immigrant City, a wannabe boxer finds work as a security guard in the Toronto suburbs, a father and daughter end up in a strange rendition of his immigrant childhood and a young man unwittingly makes contact with the underworld.\n\n\"In this wise and assured collection, Bezmozgis has reimagined immigrant lives not simply as marked by displacement and discontinuity, but of immigration as a shared and binding experience that crosses the boundaries of race, nationality, occupation, class, politics and even past betrayals, to serve as a point of connection and compassion between Bezmozgis's characters,\" the jury said in a statement.\n\nBorn in Latvia, Bezmozgis lives in Toronto. He is also the author of the novel The Betrayers and The Free World.\n\nMegan Gail Coles's debut novel Small Game Hunting At The Local Coward Gun Club is out now. (Playwrights Canada Press, House of Anansi Press)\n\nSmall Game Hunting at the Local Coward Gun Club, Megan Gail Coles's debut novel, revolves around a cast of flawed characters who are implicated in each other's hopes, dreams and pains as they try to survive harsh economic times in the province.\n\n\"This is not your traditional Newfoundland novel of social isolation. Instead, Megan Gail Coles portrays the harsh existence of the islanders'as emblematic of the human condition itself. The characters' lives unfold around a fine restaurant. They are physically and emotionally crippled by their society's devastating inequalities, the women psychologically maimed by repeated sexual assault. Coles's narrator storms against the status quo in a kinetic novel that dazzles, challenges and exhilarates,\" the jury said in a statement.\n\nColes is a playwright from St. John's. She previously published the short story collection Eating Habits of the Chronically Lonesome.\n\nMichael Crummey's new book is called The Innocents. (Doubleday Canada, Holly Hogan)\n\nIn Crummey's novel The Innocents, a young brother and sister live in isolation in Newfoundland, surviving alone on the bits of knowledge their parents left behind. Their loyalty to one another is the reason they are able to persist through storms and illness, but their relationship is tested as they grow older.\n\n\"Written in a language that is at the same time fresh and ancient, Michael Crummey's The Innocents is a (mis)creation myth that demands a reconsideration of what we think we know about love and death, family and loneliness, oblivion and wisdom, horror and beauty, bodies and knowledge, violence and desire,\" the jury said in a statement.\n\nCrummey is from Newfoundland. His other books include the novels Sweetland and Galore.\n\nDual Citizens is a novel by Alix Ohlin. (House of Anansi Press)\n\nIn Ohlin's novel Dual Citizens, Lark Brossard is a supporting character in the lives of her artistically talented loved ones: her sister Robin is a wild and brilliant pianist, while her sometime lover Lawrence is a famous filmmaker. When Lawrence tells her he doesn't want children, Lark re-examines her life and takes control of her story.\n\n\"Alix Ohlin's novel, true to its title, quietly refutes monolithic tenets that regard identity as something fixed and singular. Dividing its narrative between Canada and the U.S., the urban and the wild, solitude and solidarity, creativity and caregiving, Dual Citizens is a long-term sororal love story and affecting double-portrait of female self-actualization untethered from established paradigms of ambition\" the jury said in a statement.\n\nOhlin is the chair of the creative writing program at the University of British Columbia. She is also the author of the novel Inside and the short story collection Signs and Wonders.\n\nSteven Price is the author of Lampedusa. (McClelland & Stewart)\n\nIn Price's novel Lampedusa, the last prince of Lampedusa, Giuseppe Tomasi, faces the end of his life in 1950s Sicily. He spends his final days labouring over the manuscript of his novel, The Leopard, which he believes will be his lasting legacy.\n\n\"Lampedusa is a fairy tale about a dying prince, the last of his line, the real-life Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, author of the beloved Italian novel The Leopard. Steven Price powerfully imagines Tomasi's final days as the ailing author struggles to complete and publish his treasured manuscript. Set in a post war Palermo of bombed-out buildings and ruined palazzos, the novel contemplates what values are worth retaining in life and in art,\" the jury said in a statement.\n\nPrice lives in Victoria. He is also the author of the novel By Gaslight.\n\nIan Williams is the author of Reproduction. (Sinisa Jolic/CBC)\n\nReproduction is about Felicia and her teenage son Army. After they move into a basement apartment, they bond with the house's owner and his two children. But strange gifts from Army's wealthy, absent father begin to arrive at their doorstep, inviting new tensions into the makeshift family's lives.\n\n\"Reproduction is many things at once. It's an engrossing story of disparate people brought together and also a masterful unfolding of unexpected connections and collisions between and across lives otherwise separated by race, class, gender and geography. It's a pointed and often playful plotting out of individual and shared stories in the close spaces of hospital rooms, garages, mansions and apartments, and a symphonic performance of resonant and dissonant voices, those of persons wanting to impress persuade, deny, or beguile others, and always trying again,\" the jury said in a statement.\n\nWilliams is a poet, who has previously been shortlisted for the Griffin Poetry Prize for his collection Personals.", "description": "David Bezmozgis, Alix Ohlin, Ian Williams, Steven Price, Megan Gail Coles and Michael Crummey are the finalists for Canada's biggest literary prize.
