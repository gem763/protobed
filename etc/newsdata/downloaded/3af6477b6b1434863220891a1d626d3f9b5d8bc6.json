A young entrepreneur stopped him mid-stride, and introduced himself. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s so great to meet someone from the C100!\u2019\u201d Leckie recounts the man telling him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m just in downtown Toronto, I\u2019m not at an office where you expect to see startups,\u2019\u201d says Leckie. \u201cIt was pretty cool.\u201d\n\nBay Area venture capitalists like Leckie, managing director at Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, rarely get that kind of open-mouthed rock-star treatment in Silicon Valley, although they are a key part of its mystique\u2014the golden-robed men and women who, like ancient Roman emperors in the Colosseum, control pollice verso the fate of companies and the circulation of economy-altering sums of money.\n\nBut together, the charter members of C100 have inspired their own mystique, a coveted stamp of approval. C100 is a small, member-driven non-profit that connects Canadian tech entrepreneurs with the Valley\u2019s top Canadians in the industry. Hundreds of companies apply for 48 Hours in the Valley, its signature program, each year. Only 20 are selected. The pitch session trainings and mentorship that CEOs receive\u2014not to mention introductions to funders\u2014have contributed to the growth of companies like Clearbanc, Frank And Oak, Kik, Wealthsimple, Tulip and Well.ca. All told, more than $3 billion in venture capital was invested in Canada in 2017, and another $3.2 billion the year before that. C100 estimates that the funds companies with a C100 connection since 2010 easily stretches into the billions.\n\nYet the story of Canadian excellence in the Valley is fraught\u2014and not just by conversations at home about \u201cbrain drain,\u201d even as Canadian entrepreneurs continue to derive a net benefit from the training they get from U.S. universities and tech jobs. The other issue is the hidden history of Canadian success itself. In its reluctance to acknowledge the realities of the modern tech diaspora, Canadians\u2014or the Canadian press, at any rate\u2014have inadvertently overlooked the names and diminished the achievements of generations of Canadians who handed the baton to the tech workers transforming our digital economy.\n\nThe resulting lacuna may seem benign, but it has had real consequences for today\u2019s tech talent, according to Canadians I spoke to in the Valley. It\u2019s fostered a hesitation for Canada to celebrate its wins\u2014and has affected Canadian entrepreneurs\u2019 tendencies to see themselves playing a bigger role on the world stage.\n\nTalking Point Canadians have been pouring into Silicon Valley for decades\u2014a phenomenon often disparaged as \u201cbrain drain.\u201d Lost in the narrative is the net benefit Canadian entrepreneurs derive from their experience in the innovation epicentre.\n\n\u201cAmericans are so good at telling the entrepreneurial story and Canadians need to improve. In the mythology of Silicon Valley, we are surrounded by the Elon Musks, the Steve Jobses. Who are those people in Canada?\n\n\u201cMost kids in high school don\u2019t even know who Tobi L\u00fctke is,\u201d says Anthony Lee, a managing director at Altos Ventures and co-founder of C100, referring to the founder of Canadian e-commerce behemoth, Shopify.\n\nPeople here like to say that the longer you live outside Canada, the more fiercely Canadian you become. The charter members of C100\u2014a Who\u2019s Who of Canadian technorati\u2014pay for the privilege of participating in events and volunteering their time, not the other way around. Leckie defines the job as \u201cmaking sure that people know Canada is kicking ass.\u201d\n\nHe meets me at his office\u2014a bright, wood-beamed space whose windows overlook San Francisco\u2019s Pier 33, where tourists queue up along the ferry dock to Alcatraz. In a previous life, before attending Stanford University, Leckie was a member of the Canadian Sailing Team, who represented his home country at the Pan American Games. But the plaque he keeps in his office has nothing to do with sailing competitions. He excuses himself and comes back a minute later to show it to me: a hockey puck mounted on a trophy base, presented to Leckie by C100 to thank him for his work as an inaugural co-chair of the organization.\n\nShare the full article!

They had intended to come to the Bay Area for a year or two before returning home, but ended up staying. They are giving their time (and, sometimes, money) to help Canadian companies succeed. But they are agnostic on the question of where Canadians should locate their startups, at least in the beginning stages.\n\n\u201cWe think people ought to be in the ecosystem here, to be a part of it. If you want to be a giant in tech, you have to spend some time down here. But you don\u2019t have to stay here,\u201d says Lee.\n\nAlbinson cringes at \u201cbrain drain.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a term I find horrifically bad for the country,\u201d he says. \u201cNo, we\u2019ve always been about supporting Canadian entrepreneurs. But if you\u2019re only doing Canadian entrepreneurship in Canada, that gets away from this idea of flow. There should be no barrier for capital, people or information.\u201d\n\nSome of the people I interviewed for this story live in the Bay Area, while some have returned home to Canada. But none of them say their career trajectories would have been possible had they stayed in Canada, rather than coming to the U.S. for work experience. That\u2019s changing now, but there is too much precedent to think it will end any time soon.\n\nThe early 1990s saw a wave of Canadians pouring into the Valley on the crest of the telecom boom. Two cohorts preceded them, but their names and stories are not widely known. This is where the details get sketchy, owing to a lack of published materials. It\u2019s hard to piece together a narrative from the paucity of recorded histories: unlike the volumes of work on Americans (including American immigrants) and their successive technologies, the body of information on Canadian tech achievers is, for the most part, paper-thin.\n\nI\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s noticed, either. \u201cI\u2019ve not come across an historian of Canadian technology. If you find said person, please share their name with me,\u201d John Stackhouse tells me. The former editor-in-chief of The Globe and Mail now works for RBC, and is writing a book on the Canadian diaspora. He helped a bit with the following history.\n\nCanadians at U.S. engineering schools in the \u201840s and \u201850s undertook advanced studies and research as part of the Cold War nuclear academic arms race. Starting in the \u201860s, Canadians are thought to have worked at companies like Fairchild Semiconductor, one of the early chipmakers that helped Silicon Valley get its name.\n\nIn subsequent years, Canadians were among the engineers who developed software programs, modems and routers at companies on both sides of the border. The University of Waterloo\u2019s computer science program was established in 1964, soon becoming one of the biggest of its kind in the world, catching the eye of companies like IBM. Around that time, U.S. companies started hiring Waterloo grads, a tradition that continues today.\n\nSome important names come up in conversations that track the origin story of Canadians in the Valley\u2014people of Canadian descent whom some of today\u2019s tech cohort have claimed as their forebears. Cecil Green, co-founder of Texas Instruments, was born in England and raised in Vancouver, where he studied at the University of British Columbia in the \u201820s. His financial gift helped build the university\u2019s Green College and a visiting professorship program. Gururaj \u201cDesh\u201d Deshpande is an Indian immigrant who studied at the University of New Brunswick (UNB) and Queen\u2019s University in the late \u201870s. He worked at a Motorola subsidiary in Toronto and later co-founded Sycamore Networks, one of the biggest IPOs of the telecoms era, and endowed an innovation centre at UNB. And then there\u2019s James Gosling, the father of the Java computing language, who was born and raised in Calgary and worked at Sun Microsystems for nearly three decades before moving on to Oracle, Google and Amazon Web Services.\n\nBy the \u201890s, Canadians were thick on the ground in early computer software, graphic design, telecoms and mobile. And then they started climbing the masts of the Silicon Valley flagships: Shaan Pruden at Apple, Jeff Skoll at eBay, Don Listwin and Rob Lloyd at Cisco, Jeff Mallett at Yahoo, Doug Roseborough at Oracle and Rob Burgess at Macromedia (now Adobe). The list really does go on\u2014and that\u2019s before you get to today\u2019s top Canadians who occupy the upper ranks at marquee companies like Facebook, Dropbox, Uber, Google, Salesforce, Zynga and Slack.\n\nSilicon Valley Canadians of the late \u201890s and early aughts didn\u2019t have a lot of ways to find each other. There was\u2014and still is\u2014the delightfully-named Digital Moose Lounge, which hosts social gatherings like Canada Day events. Aside from that, people were mostly dispersed, ending up camouflaged among American colleagues at work. Later, when LinkedIn came along, Leckie created a \u201cCanadians in the Bay Area\u201d LinkedIn group, and Canadians started self-identifying. That helped form the basis for C100\u2019s early outreach.\n\nThe Canadian ability to blend in has made it surprisingly difficult to pin a number on the population of expats in the Bay Area; various estimates peg it at somewhere between 250,000 and 350,000. Not even Rana Sarkar, consul general of Canada in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, knows for sure. He says, \u201cA good chunk may have dual passports and\u2026are inadvertent Canadians: either their parents are Canadian, or they moved down here at a young age or they\u2019re laying low and have married an American.\u201d\n\nBut the central question of what constitutes a Canadian is an interesting one, he reckons. What about people like Deshpande and Musk, who passed through Canada and occasionally reference their maple-leaf roots? \u201cIf someone\u2019s mom or dad is a Canadian and they\u2019ve only visited the country a few times, does that mean they\u2019re a Canadian of interest?\u201d Sarkar asks. If the answer is yes, the narrative of the Canadian diaspora will need to be expanded\u2014and many in the Valley think Canada will the better for it.\n\n\u2219\n\nThere\u2019s an expression Albinson, the C100 co-founder, uses often: \u201cWhen the United States catches a cold, Canada catches the flu.\u201d In 2008, Canada\u2019s tech sector had a bad flu in the midst of the financial crisis. \u201cCanada, as an innovation economy, was on death\u2019s door,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThere was no venture capital. There was no angel money. And all over the country, entrepreneurs were losing their companies. Nortel was dead, Research in Motion [known as BlackBerry] was wobbly.\u201d\n\nIt took a crisis for Canadians of the Valley to see themselves as a collective asset.\n\nIn addition to co-founding C100, Albinson is co-founder of Founders Circle and Panorama Capital. A Kingston boy, he was always intrigued by a painting of the Golden Gate Bridge that his grandmother brought home from a trip to San Francisco. He dislikes hierarchy and the East Coast. And he loves the weather and beauty of his adopted home of Larkspur, a little town in Marin County, Calif., where he meets me in the garden patio of a restaurant with fountains and birdsong.\n\nBack in 2002, when he was a venture capitalist at JP Morgan Partners, Albinson was part of a trip to India designed to showcase the country\u2019s goal of becoming a technology leader by 2020. In Delhi, he witnessed the benefits of viewing Indian expatriates not as a lost liability but rather as an asset. The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE) is a Silicon Valley-based non-profit that connects entrepreneurs with South Asian roots around the world with funding, networking, education and mentorship. Founded in 1992, TiE became a model for C100 to emulate in building its own support ecosystem for expats.\n\nBy contrast, in 2008, Canada had few startup incubators. And it had a tax law requirement that made foreign venture funding of Canadian startups so difficult that investors were skipping the country altogether\u2014Crunchbase called it \u201ca leper colony for tech entrepreneurs.\u201d Canada eliminated the tax section in 2010, after lobbying by stakeholders like C100, says Albinson.\n\n\u201cWe realized the Canadian environment was very fractured,\u201d says Albinson. \u201cOne of the reasons why Canada wasn\u2019t having that much success wasn\u2019t that the entrepreneurs weren\u2019t good, but because the ecosystem around them was a mess.\u201d\n\nAlbinson and Lee hatched C100 together just minutes after first meeting at an event in Palo Alto sponsored by the Canadian government. The consul general wanted to recruit them to a business advisory board to stimulate industry connections, but they had a better idea.\n\nIn January 2009, Albinson stood in front of the 85 most successful Canadians in a conference room on Sand Hill Road, the so-called \u201cWall Street of the West\u201d in Menlo Park, Calif.. He cleared his throat and issued a call to action on behalf of their homeland. \u201cI looked them in the eye and said, \u2018You\u2019ve had the privilege of a passport, you\u2019ve had an amazing education. Because you\u2019re in this room, you\u2019ve had a lot of success down here. You have a responsibility. We want to start this. You owe it to these entrepreneurs to do this.\u2019\u201d\n\nLee says they felt inspired by Own the Podium, the national campaign (now a non-profit) to invest in Canadian winter sports that helped make Canada the top gold-medal finisher at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. \u201cIt was very un-Canadian to say, \u2018We\u2019re going to win,\u2019\u201d says Lee, \u201cand I think it was kind of a turning point for the Canadian psyche\u201d (Later, C100 created its own video homage to Own the Podium with a Silicon Valley twist: \u201cIt\u2019s about claiming the podium as ours, painting it red and white, crushing it and sprinkling the dust into the eyes of our competitors\u201d).\n\nAlbinson and Lee weren\u2019t sure if their pitch would work. It was a novel ask, and people inside the room had no reason to contribute, other than their patriotism. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t know was, did the thing that burns inside me about being Canadian, was that in everybody?\u201d says Albinson.\n\nNearly everyone took out a pen and wrote a cheque for US$850.\n\n\u2219\n\nWhat a difference a decade makes. As Canada\u2019s tech sector gains traction, government support and major venture capital from south of the border, the freshly-laid infrastructure convinces top Canadians in the Valley that the growth trend will accelerate. It\u2019s when someone like Montreal native Patrick Pichette moves on from his role as CFO at Google and turns venture capitalist, joining iNovia with the express purpose of elevating Canada\u2019s best startups. Or when homegrown Hootsuite hero Ryan Holmes uses his success to build a national entrepreneurship accelerator to help youth in Canada launch the next big thing.\n\nIn 2017, Canadian companies comprised 14 per cent of the Deloitte Technology Fast 500, which tracks the fastest-growing tech companies in North America, up roughly three per cent from the year before.\n\nToday, it\u2019s U.S. venture firms that are working to get in front of Canadian entrepreneurs. Andrew D\u2019Souza, co-founder and CEO of fintech service company Clearbanc, says he personally hears from at least one U.S. venture capitalist a week, usually from San Francisco or New York, asking him for advice on whom they ought to be meeting with in Toronto. \u201cPeople are starting to wake up and realize there\u2019s great talent and great companies built here,\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s no longer strictly a requirement for Canadian entrepreneurs to knock on Silicon Valley doors for Series A funding, or even to base their companies in the Bay Area, says D\u2019Souza. But you do need a \u201cgood connection\u201d in the Valley, if only to level-set with the competition. \u201cIn Canada it\u2019s very easy to be a big deal before you\u2019ve accomplished very much. You can get in The Globe and Mail and you can get on TV\u2026. It\u2019s helpful to be able to look up and realize you\u2019re actually competing on a global scale.\u201d He co-founded Clearbanc in San Francisco in 2015, but a year later, it was clear the conditions were right for a move to Toronto. Now he recruits from both countries.\n\nAlbinson talks about being Canadian as though it were a superpower. \u201cYou tell people, \u2018I\u2019m Canadian,\u2019 and suddenly you\u2019re into three levels of trust. You need to be very, very careful with that. That\u2019s one of the things I tell the C100 folks: we have this amplification that we\u2019ve been entrusted with, whether we know it or not.\u201d\n\nMore than a decade after Canada\u2019s telecoms era sputtered, the country\u2019s tech economy has all the ingredients it needs to dominate. What\u2019s missing right now may not be something C100 can provide.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost just a matter of confidence,\u201d says Lee. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve noticed is that Canadians working in any industry will pay more attention to Canadians outside the country. Canadians have always needed outside validation. It\u2019s always been part of the culture.\u201d\n\nHe pauses. \u201cPart of what we\u2019re trying to say is, \u2018Stop it, already.\u2019\u201d\n\nAmericans don\u2019t need to name their success stories constantly because they\u2019re all sewn into the mythology. They\u2019ve managed to make all their disparate stories into American ones\u2014to give them an inevitability. But in this case, history is being made in real time by Canadians at home and abroad in an industry that has little narrative of its own.\n\nCanadians will recall getting intermittent history lessons on TV in the \u201890s by way of \u201cHeritage Minutes\u201d\u2014 those iconic national video clips depicting important Canadian moments. They\u2019re how we learned about Canada\u2019s contributions to basketball, Superman and even the real-life bear that was said to have inspired Winnie the Pooh. But why not the father of Java?\n\n\u201cI grew up during the Canadian iconography era,\u201d says Leckie, referring to those film clips. \u201cIt\u2019s always been my goal that Canadian tech would have that moment in the sun.\u201d\n\nIf that happens, it will need to include the Silicon Valley diaspora.", "description": "How a generation of startup pioneers planted Canada\u2019s flag in the Bay Area, putting down roots that would ultimately spur Canadian innovation at home and abroad.", "authors": ["Julia Scott", "Jessica Galang", "The Logic"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/historyOfTech_v2-jpeg.jpg", "published_at": "2018-06-12"}
