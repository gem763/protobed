It has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of inciting the unrest.\n\nHong Kong's economy is on the verge of its first recession in a decade. Tourist arrivals in August dropped by nearly half from the same month in 2018, Commerce Secretary Yau Tang-wah told reporters on Friday.\n\n\"Arrivals in August dropped 49.6 per cent,\" he said. \"Early in September they dropped by 30 per cent to 40 per cent. The situation is severe.\"\n\nCrowds chanting anti-government slogans trapped city leader Carrie Lam in a stadium on Thursday after she held her first \"open dialogue\" with the people in bid to quell the unrest.\n\nMore than four hours after the talks had ended, a convoy carrying Lam and other senior officials left the area under police guard.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [HONG KONG] Hong Kong is bracing for a weekend of unrest with pro-democracy protests likely to mount in the China-ruled territory ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic on Tuesday. .
