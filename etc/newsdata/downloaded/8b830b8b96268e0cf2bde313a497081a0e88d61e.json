Cheri Bustos. | Charlie Neibergall/AP Photo congress House campaign chairs snipe over personal attacks\n\nAUSTIN, Texas \u2014 The heads of the two parties\u2019 House campaign committees sparred over the tone of the battle for control of Congress in 2020 at a heated public event on Saturday.\n\nRep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, accused her counterpart, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Emmer (Minn.) of \u201ccrossing a line\u201d after the NRCC\u2019s staff mocked freshman Rep. Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.) and his wife in press statements and on social media this week.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cAnd this week, it just so crossed a line \u2014 so crossed a line \u2014 that Chairman Emmer and the Republican congressional committee, the NRCC, went after the wife of a member of Congress because she [posted] on her social media about marriage counseling,\u201d Bustos said at a panel discussion with Emmer at the Texas Tribune Festival.\n\nThe joint appearance between the two committee chairs came at the end of a turbulent week in the House, with Democratic leadership announcing support for an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump\u2019s conduct.\n\nFollowing that announcement, Amanda Cunningham, whose husband is a vulnerable freshman Democrat from a South Carolina district Trump carried by 13 points in 2016, posted on Instagram a favorable message about Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s support for impeachment.\n\nCiting a previous Amanda Cunningham post in which she protested that her federally supported health insurance plan does not cover mental health services like therapy or marriage counseling, an NRCC spokeswoman sent a note to reporters.\n\n\u201cLooks like Mrs. Cunningham likes a man who supports baseless impeachment,\u201d the NRCC's Camille Gallo wrote, above a screenshot of Amanda Cunningham\u2019s Instagram story. \u201c[W]onder if this will come up in Joe Cunningham\u2019s marriage counseling?\u201d\n\nEmmer defended the message, which was also posted to the NRCC\u2019s Twitter account.\n\n\u201cThat was already published,\u201d Emmer said Saturday, referencing news outlets that had picked up Amanda Cunningham\u2019s complaint about her health insurance. \u201cSo, if someone\u2019s got a problem with the publisher of the statement, that I think is where that should go.\u201d\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

I don\u2019t talk about people\u2019s children. I don\u2019t talk about if somebody\u2019s in marriage counseling. I don\u2019t talk about those kind of things. I think you can talk about somebody\u2019s voting record, and I think all of that\u2019s fair game. But I don\u2019t believe in getting personal.\u201d\n\nEmmer argued that Democrats are the ones coarsening the political discourse. He made an apparent reference to comments from Rep. Filemon Vela (D-Texas), who last week called retiring Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas) \u201ca racist Christian pretender\u201d on Twitter and later told the Texas Tribune Conaway was \u201ca chicken s--- generally.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re saying today, but what you did a week and a half ago to a member of the Texas delegation, whose family and spouse did not inject themselves into a campaign and get published in a local newspaper,\u201d Emmer said. \u201cYou went after the spouse and children, and they weren\u2019t involved at all in the campaign process.\u201d\n\nBut Vela\u2019s attack didn\u2019t come from Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, and Bustos seemed confused by Emmer\u2019s message.\n\n\u201cCan you elaborate?\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t know at all what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nFrom there, the conversation devolved into heated crosstalk.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t accuse me of anything without \u2026\u201d Bustos responded before she was cut off.\n\n\u201cYou accused me,\u201d Emmer shot back.\n\n\u201cThat was a fact,\u201d said Bustos. \u201cDoes anybody want to call up their tweet?\u201d\n\nLater, during an audience Q-and-A at the end of the hour-long session, an attendee accused the two members of illustrating exactly what is wrong with Washington.\n\nSteven Shepard reported from Washington.", "description": "The joint appearance between the two committee chairs came at the end of a turbulent week in the House.", "authors": ["Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez", "Steven Shepard"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f1/4a/d73030394e8d97bce3fd7cd0e64c/19928-cheri-bustos-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
