Thai authorities presented an Interpol red notice, issued at Bahrain\u2019s request, as the basis for his arrest.\n\nBahrain sought his extradition over vandalism allegations, which al-Araibi has always denied.\n\nInterpol had initially been told by Bahrain that al-Araibi had left Australia on a fraudulent passport.\n\nThe agency \u2013 via the AFP \u2013 was then told by Border Force officials that al-Araibi was travelling on a legitimate travel document and that he was on a protection visa.\n\nBut that crucial email went unread for five days, according to the ABC. AFP deputy commissioner Ramzi Jabbour has previously told Senate estimates the email was missed because the official who received it had gone on leave.\n\nBut the timeline of the emails obtained by the ABC show Border Force responded to the AFP\u2019s request for confirmation of his passport details less than an hour after it was sent at 9.06am on 28 November.\n\nA spokesperson for the AFP explained the bungle to the ABC by saying the AFP official had \u201cworked for a short period on the morning of 28 November 2018, following which they were on leave until 3 December 2018\u201d.\n\nThe emails also reveal that on that same day home affairs looked into cancelling al-Araibi\u2019s protection visa during his incarceration. An email sent by the home affairs character and cancellation branch to Australia\u2019s Interpol branch in Canberra showed an official sought to \u201cdisclose the red notice for the purposes of visa cancellation\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson for home affairs told the ABC any case could be referred to the character and cancellation branch if an Interpol red notice was issued.\n\nThe spokesperson said officers were \u201crequired to assess all circumstances \u2026 and were able to quickly determine that the red notice did not enliven the cancellation provisions\u201d.\n\nIt would eventually be revealed that Bahrain was granted the red notice against Interpol\u2019s policies, which protect refugees from the country they fled. Al-Araibi has lived in Australia for five years and has refugee status based on his fears of persecution in Bahrain.\n\nAl-Araibi was eventually freed when Thailand dropped the extradition proceedings, and he returned to Australia in February after 76 days in jail. In March, he became an Australian citizen.\n\nOn Friday the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, blamed the bungle on \u201chuman error\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs I think the Australian Border Force commissioner, Michael Outram, pointed out in Senate estimates and the now previous federal police commissioner has made note of as well, there was a human error in that case,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Australian federal police and ABF work on thousands of cases each year and in this one case, they made an error. They are looking at the systems and we want to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nBut the case raises questions about communication within the home affairs department.\n\nIn February, former AFP commissioner Andrew Colvin said the AFP \u2013 which acts as Interpol\u2019s national central bureau in Australia \u2013 relied on the home affairs department to access visa information, and to tell them if someone subject to a red notice was a refugee.\n\nJohn Blaxland, a professor at the strategic and defence studies centre at the Australian National University who has been critical of home affairs\u2019 formation because of the potential to erode checks of power between agencies, said al-Ariabi\u2019s case would likely be used by the department to argue for further streamlining.\n\nHakeem al-Araibi: thank you Australia for bringing me home \u2013 but my fight is not over Read more\n\n\u201cI suspect [the department secretary] Mike Pezzullo may well use this as an argument to justify the further consolidation of power because it will point to the need for greater streamlining of IT arrangements, for example,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cClearly there has been a degree of disconnection here. So while the action was embarrassing for all concerned, it will be fuel for his campaign to bring about greater coordination and internal tightness of information.\u201d\n\nBlaxland said there would need to be additional checks in place to prevent abuses of power if the barriers between agencies were broken down further.\n\n\u201cI get that there is utility in streamlining things, particularly to prevent the occurrence of what happened with Hakeem al-Araibi, but with that comes a concern about the all-seeing eye,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhile closer control could have been helpful with Hakeem, it could well be detrimental in other cases and that\u2019s the key thing. I\u2019m OK with additional measures as long as there are safeguards and account measures to ensure that power is not abused.\u201d", "description": "Newly released emails reveal chain of bureaucratic bungles that could have further endangered al-Araibi", "authors": ["Michael Mcgowan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/694ce837fb8790e5b9d0fa2f15bcacd7b78b45ca/0_111_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bd358b4e5a2da76e6c73158e261c49c0", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
