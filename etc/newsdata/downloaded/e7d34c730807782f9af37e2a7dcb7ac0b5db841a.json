That has stopped.\n\nThose same partners, the Syrian Democratic Forces, had also been quietly releasing some Islamic State prisoners and incorporating them into their ranks, in part as a way to keep them under watch. That, too, is now in jeopardy.\n\nAnd across Syria\u2019s porous border with Iraq, Islamic State fighters are conducting a campaign of assassination against local village headmen, in part to intimidate government informants\u2026\n\nNews of the American withdrawal set off jubilation among Islamic State supporters on social media and encrypted chat networks.
