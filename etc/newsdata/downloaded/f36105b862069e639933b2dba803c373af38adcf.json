Perhaps they should; after all, in at least one case\u2014Yemen\u2014there\u2019s blood on Americans\u2019 collective hands. Only don\u2019t expect the public to lose much sleep over the potential for millions of Yemeni deaths. There are Trumpian tweets to dissect and reality TV dramas unfolding for all to see at the helm of the crumbling republic.\n\nFor two full years now, Saudi Arabia\u2014a petro-state of strict, Islamist, Wahhabi extremists\u2014has dropped American-made precision guided munitions on Yemeni \u201crebels\u201d and civilians alike. Saudi fighter-bombers commute daily to the slaughter zone, courtesy of in-flight refueling missions flown by the U.S. Air Force. How nice.\n\nAlmost no one knows the backstory, understands the incessant suffering or contemplates the consequences, both moral and strategic. Why should the American public care? There\u2019s no military draft, no new taxes, no food or fuel rationing on the homefront. Besides, unless one subscribes to the BBC, there\u2019s almost no media coverage of the shadow war in Yemen.\n\nPredictions are always tricky, but here\u2019s one: Americans will come to regret their government\u2019s role in Yemen as millions perish and al-Qaida/Islamic State rise ever more powerfully, like a mythical phoenix. The late Chalmers Johnson and the CIA call it \u201cblowback\u201d: The empire\u2019s proverbial chickens come home to roost.\n\nLet us start from the beginning. What is now northwestern Yemen was, for a thousand years, a Zaydi Shia imamate. It is from this region that the Saudis\u2019 nemeses, the Houthis\u2014named for a prominent, local Shia family\u2014emerged. There were two Yemens, North and South, from the fall of the imamate in the 1960s until a hasty reunification in 1990. North Yemen, the Yemen Arab Republic, boasted most of the population and nearly all of the Zaydis. South Yemen, the People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Yemen, arose as a Soviet client state after pushing out British imperialists in 1967 and consisted mostly of Sunni Arabs. Southern Yemen was, in fact, the ancestral home of the bin Laden family. The post-Cold War unification of Yemen proved an unhappy marriage, rife with a three-decade dictator, widespread corruption, and\u2014occasionally\u2014civil war.\n\nIt\u2019s a long, complex story, but suffice it to say the Arab Spring of 2011 shattered Yemen\u2019s unstable status quo. A strongman stepped down (but not out), a new, weaker president clung to the south, and, sensing opportunity, the disgruntled Houthis seized most of the north. It might have remained a local conflict were Yemen\u2019s powerful northern neighbor\u2014Saudi Arabia\u2014not locked in a regional tug of war with Iran and its own restive Shia minority, which, coincidentally, sits atop the kingdom\u2019s best oil fields. Instead, the high-tech Saudi Air Force quickly pummeled Houthi-occupied cities, and the Saudi Navy blockaded Yemen\u2019s ports\u2014this, in a country that imports much of its food and where just 2.2 percent of the land is arable.\n\nThat\u2019s where the Americans come in. It\u2019s an open secret that Saudi Arabia\u2014a rigid theocracy that beheads women for \u201csorcery\u201d\u2014owes its regional military dominance to generous aid and arms sales from the United States. In return, the U.S. and its allies could long count (usually) on generous supplies of the kingdom\u2019s liquid gold: oil. The reciprocal relationship survived the terrorist attacks of 9/11 (even though 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis), the \u201cWar on Terror,\u201d the invasion of Iraq and the rise of Islamic State. Lest anyone doubt the durability of this devil\u2019s bargain, President Trump spent his first overseas trip in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, and announced a joint \u201cstrategic vision\u201d and a record $110 billion arms deal.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a Trump story, unfortunately. The Saudis launched their ferocious onslaught against north and west Yemen in 2015, under President Obama. Trump is more flagrant, of course\u2014prone to traditional sword-dancing with robed princes\u2014but \u201cno-drama\u201d Obama quietly facilitated the Saudi terror campaign for the better part of two years. Reasons abound, but mainly the U.S. government was bamboozled by a Saudi (and Israeli) propaganda machine veritably obsessed with vilifying Iran. Not that the U.S. needed much encouragement; after all, Iran was labeled a charter member of George W. Bush\u2019s \u201caxis of evil.\u201d\n\nThe scam goes something like this: Iran is Shia. Iran hates Israel and, supposedly\u2014if doubtfully\u2014threatens to \u201cwipe Israel off the map.\u201d The Saudis, our friends, are Sunni. The Yemeni Houthis are Shia (though a completely separate branch from the Iranians). Thus, Iran must be behind the whole Houthi rebellion and the Houthis merely an extension of Iran\u2019s existential threat to Israel. Saudi Arabia must, therefore, be justified in its brutal bombing campaign. Consider it a twisted use of the transitive property of equality.\n\nIt\u2019s not true, of course. Iran has, it seems, attempted to provide limited support to the Houthis, but it certainly wasn\u2019t behind the rebellion, which is an age-old Yemeni problem. Furthermore, in January the United Nations Panel of Experts concluded that \u201cit had not seen sufficient evidence to confirm any direct, large-scale supply from Iran.\u201d And, in March, the U.S. Congressional Research Service noted \u201cmany Western observers agree that Iranian aid to the Houthis does not match the scale of its commitments \u2026 in other parts of the Middle East.\u201d Facts\u2014who needs them? Especially when Iran is such a useful regional boogeyman and scapegoat for Israelis, Saudis and Americans alike.\n\nThat\u2019s the rub. Yemenis are, in reality, merely pawns in a regional cold war; and, given Israeli and Saudi crimes, it is unclear the U.S. is on the right side. Now, with the hawks ascendant, the Iran nuclear deal decertified and Trump\u2019s Iran hysteria reaching fever pitch, matters are likely only to worsen.\n\nTake one look at the tragic, increasingly stagnant battle lines, and it becomes apparent: Yemen appears once again to be fracturing into northern and southern halves. Maybe it\u2019s all but inevitable; maybe Americans can\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t attempt to) change that. It is the same story across the Greater Middle East, at least since America\u2019s ill-advised invasion of Iraq: fracture\u2014regional rupture along sectarian and ethnic lines as the mirage of colonial borders finally splinters. Think Syria, think Iraq\u2014specifically the Kurdish territories. Perhaps American intervention in the form of bombs, fuelers and plenty of cash can only aggravate a regional catastrophe. That may not harmonize with the \u201cfight them over there or we\u2019ll have to fight them at home\u201d crowd, but it appears increasingly likely.\n\nThe humanitarian price of Operation Renewal of Hope\u2014oh, the Saudis do have a flair for euphemism\u2014is difficult to measure. Yemen remains under siege and is, thanks to our Saudi clients, a journalistic dead zone. Yet this much is certain: There are real people\u2014mostly civilians\u2014under all those precision bombs. And they\u2019re dying, starving and suffering in immense numbers.\n\nThe United Nations and various nongovernmental organizations warn of Yemen\u2019s \u201cunprecedented humanitarian crisis.\u201d The official count of civilian dead (10,000 in two years) is a low-ball figure, but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. The World Food Program estimates that 7.3 million Yemenis are in need of immediate food aid. Nearly half a million children suffer from \u201csevere acute malnutrition.\u201d The World Health Organization adds that 14.8 million people lack \u201caccess to basic health care,\u201d including the country\u2019s 2 million internally displaced persons. To make matters worse, a veritable cholera pandemic, the worst in history, has broken out. All the while, the Saudis maintain a tight noose around Yemen, a blockade that, according to the U.N., threatens to starve millions.\n\nThink we\u2019ll see a Trump tweet about this epic mass murder? Don\u2019t count on it; our dear leader is still busy boasting about his victory in the 2016 election.\n\nUndoubtedy, the suffering of Yemeni civilians is the core issue; but it\u2019s not the only problem. America\u2019s enabling of a Saudi terror campaign has left much of Yemen\u2019s rugged provinces all but ungoverned. The result: al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)\u2014once labeled the deadliest AQ franchise\u2014and the nascent Islamic State (IS) faction have been empowered by the war. State collapse in Yemen\u2019s eastern desert has left the jihadis in charge. Make no mistake, if a terrorist attack on the U.S. originates in Yemen (and it might), it will be AQAP or Islamic State\u2014not the Houthis\u2014who are responsible. Ironically, America\u2019s \u201copponents,\u201d Iran and the Houthis, loathe AQAP and IS. It\u2019s all so counterproductive that it borders on the absurd.\n\nThe United States is failing in Yemen (and the entire Middle East, for that matter) ethically and strategically. America is complicit in the collapse of an impoverished, failed state that will undoubtedly breed generations of hopeless, displaced young men of the sort ripe for terrorist recruitment. The U.S. role in Yemen counts not only because millions may die, but because it matters how Americans are viewed on the proverbial Arab street. Even if one is loath to discuss morals or human rights, consider it this way: What if the hawkish status quo only emboldens terrorists and endangers American soldiers? By that logic, withdrawing support from Saudi aggression could save American lives. Doing right can also mean doing well. Surely even political conservatives can get behind that logic, right? Wrong. Count on a broad consensus of U.S. policymakers, Democratic and Republican, to line up behind our Saudi clients and stand by as Yemen burns.\n\nI, for one, long ago lost my First World aptitude for dismissing the wholesale death of brown folks and foreigners. There were just too many dead babies in the Baghdad of 2007, and they looked all too human to these eyes. As the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas wrote after seeing a child\u2019s corpse in post-blitz London: \u201cAfter the first death \u2026 there is no other.\u201d So it is, and so it will forever be for this repentant soldier.\n\nIt matters what is done in our name\u2014or, at least, it should.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author, expressed in an unofficial capacity, and do not reflect the official policy or position of the Department of the Army, Department of Defense or the U.S. government.", "description": "The \u201cFour Famines\u201d: That\u2019s what aid workers call the swell of man-made humanitarian catastrophes replete with disease, hunger and civil conflict\u2014fo", "authors": ["Leslie Lee", "Jacob Bacharach", "Robert Scheer", "Scott Ritter", "Allan Sloan", "Robert Reich", "Jessica Corbett", "Steve Peoples", "The Associated Press", "Cathy Bussewitz"], "top_image": "https://www.truthdig.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/AP_17324392512478.jpg", "published_at": "2017-11-24"}
