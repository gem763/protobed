The claims come amid a battle with the U.S. government, which alleges Huawei works with the Chinese government to steal intellectual property from U.S. companies and that it has illegally done business with Iran. Huawei, a flagship technology company in China, has also become a key bargaining chip in what is a deepening trade war with the U.S.\n\nThe company alleges the U.S. government is relying on \"judicial and administrative powers, as well as a host of other unscrupulous means\" to disrupt its operations. These include claims that the U.S. has instructed law enforcement to \"to threaten, menace, coerce, entice, and incite both current and former Huawei employees to turn against the company and work for them.\"\n\n(1/4) For months, the U.S. has leveraged its political and diplomatic influence to lobby other governments to ban Huawei gear, using every tool at its disposal to disrupt normal business operations of Huawei and its partners.

But Americans can't easily buy its devices because the U.S. House of Representatives and the FBI are concerned that Huawei is a threat to national security.\n\nIn the statement, Huawei also denied stealing technology from Portuguese inventor Rui Pedro Oliveira, who earlier this year claimed the Chinese firm had ripped off his design for a 360-degree camera. Huawei said it began selling its own 360-degree camera in 2017, \"independently designed and developed by Huawei's employees having no access to Mr. Oliveira's information.\"", "description": "Chinese telecommunications company says the U.S. is \"using every tool at its disposal\" to disrupt its business", "authors": ["Aimee Picchi"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/21/977e59b9-3b0e-4b02-a07b-7194d9dbe016/thumbnail/1200x630/fc822cb56c0f4e735b9119364d5be4cd/rtx6vvd8.jpg"}
