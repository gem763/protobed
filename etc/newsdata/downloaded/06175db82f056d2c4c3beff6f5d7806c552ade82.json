Cox, celebrating the 25th anniversary of the debut of Friends this year, is no stranger to finding similarities in her life. Earlier this year, Cox posted a photo on her Instagram of her daughter, Coco, wearing the same dress Cox wore 21 years earlier. The Friends tributes have been everywhere in the last few weeks, with Cox having a mini-reunion with several of her co-stars and even going so far as to recreate specific scenes from the show\u2019s history.\n\nMoore is also having a banner month with the upcoming release of her memoir, Inside Out.\n\nThe memoir is an examination of Moore\u2019s career in Hollywood, as well as her marriages with Bruce Willis and Ashton Kutcher. In an interview with Harper\u2019s Bazaar, Moore discussed her harsh upbringing, having to deal with a mother addicted to drugs.\n\nShe also talked about how she turned to drinking after having a miscarriage during her marriage to Kutcher. It was one of many moments that left her estranged from her family, including her three daughters with Willis: Rumer, 31, Scout, 27, and Tallulah, 25. Thankfully, the mother and daughters share an incredibly close relationship today, with Moore regularly celebrating her daughters on her social media.\n\nCox and Moore may not be real twins, but it\u2019s fantastic to see both a sweet friendship between them that enhances their \u201ctwinning\u201d relationship.\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.
