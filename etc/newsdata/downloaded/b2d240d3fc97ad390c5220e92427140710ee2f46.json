It was likely the final appearance of a Hall of Fame career.\n\nSabathia, 39, entered the game with the Yankees down 7-3 in relief of Adam Ottavino, with two runners on base. A run came home on a fielding error before Sabathia retired Carlos Correa and hit Robinson Chirinos.\n\nTrainers came out to assess Sabathia, though it was unclear to viewers where he was feeling discomfort. He got back on the mound to try one more pitch, but could not continue. Sabathia walked off the field for perhaps the last time of his 19-year career to a standing ovation.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNew York Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia may have thrown the last pitch of his likely Hall of Fame career.
