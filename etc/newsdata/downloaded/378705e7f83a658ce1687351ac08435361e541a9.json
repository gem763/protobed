I am sorry if I offended anyone by singing along to The Fugees, to a song I love, that I grew up on.\n\n\u2018I love Lauryn Hill and I really am sorry if I offended you.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnimpressed fans flocked to Twitter to call the actress out over the video, with her name trending worldwide within minutes.\n\nGina was trending worldwide on Twitter after the video (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018The fact that she thought this was fine and posted it is LAUGHABLE,\u2019 one fumed.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t get it. I really don\u2019t. She claims to be so woke and caring about people\u2019s struggles yet doesn\u2019t even pretend to care about what black people tell her,\u2019 another said.\n\n\u2018I wonder if she\u2019s even going to acknowledge this.\u2019\n\n\u2018All she had to do was NOT say that part,\u2019 an unimpressed fan suggested. \u2018She had the whole verse to rap, with so many other words. All she had to do\u2026\u2026.\u2019\n\nA follower asked: \u2018Why would Gina Rodriguez even post that???\u2019\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Gina has been accused of being \u2018anti-black\u2019, after she sparked outrage with her comments on women\u2019s pay at the end of last year.\n\nDuring a roundtable interview last year \u2013 alongside Gabrielle Union, Ellen Pompeo and Emma Roberts, the Netflix star was met with fury when she claimed black women get paid more than their Latina and Asian counterparts.\n\nHowever, many accused her of being inaccurate and \u2018anti-black\u2019, stating Sofia Vergara is the highest paid actress according to Forbes.\n\nShe later broke down when addressing the wave of intense backlash she faced, revealing: \u2018The backlash was devastating, to say the least.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The black community was the only community I looked towards growing up. We didn\u2019t have many Latino shows and the black community made me feel like I was seen. So to get anti-black is saying I\u2019m anti-family.\n\n\u2018If anything, the black community is my community,\u2019 she continued on Sway\u2019s Universe. \u2018As Latinos, we have black Latinos; that is what we are. I am not, so I think when I speak about Latino advocacy, people believe I mean only my skin colour, little do they know I\u2019m very aware of what my culture is, and the opportunities I create, and who I put in those spaces are both the Latino and the black community.\n\n\u2018When that happened, that was really f**king hard. Because what do you say? Sorry for cheating when you didn\u2019t cheat?\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Gina\u2019s reps for a comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
