Also in the Top 10 were Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg (No. 3), Salesforce\u2019s Marc Benioff (No. 4), Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella (No. 6) and Apple\u2019s Tim Cook (No. 8) made the cut.\n\nBut readers had to scroll down to No. 75 to find the only woman on the list, Ross Stores CEO Barbara Rentler.\n\nSunny Bonnell, co-founder of branding firm Motto, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi AM this week that by not including more women on their list, Forbes sent a message to young women.\n\n\u201cThis is just sending a message that we are less than, we are not equal, we don\u2019t have the right qualities, we don\u2019t have the right attributes, we\u2019re too emotional,\u201d Bonnell said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s just sending a sort of a sinister message to anyone that has those audacious dreams of becoming something.\u201d\n\nThe oversight didn\u2019t go unnoticed by others, either. Throughout the weekend, people took to social media to voice their concerns. \u201cNot even a photo of Barbara Rentler,\u201d one Twitter user pointed out.\n\nThe backlash finally led Forbes editor Randall Lane to tweet: \u201cWe blew it. Now we\u2019re doing what journalists do: figuring out how this happened and learning from it.\u201d\n\nJeff Bezos seen on day two of Summit LA17 in Downtown Los Angeles's Historic Broadway Theater District on Saturday, Nov. 4, 2017, in Los Angeles.

We should not be questioning why are more women not in the forefront of our media, our business landscape, our political landscape. It\u2019s time to change things.\u201d\n\n\u2018A rare breed\u2019\n\nThe optics of this Forbes list still places women in the background, \u201csending a message that women are not good enough,\u201d Hansberger told Yahoo Finance. She and Bonnell co-wrote the book \u201cRare Breed: A Guide to Success for the Defiant, Dangerous, and Different.\u201d\n\nThe title derives from the fact that female CEOs are a \u201crare breed,\u201d Hansberger said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of women at the top, and that needs to change, first and foremost.\u201d\n\nNEW YORK, NY - APRIL 12: Stitch Fix founder and CEO Katrina Lake (R) speaks onstage during Vanity Fair's Founders Fair at Spring Studios on April 12, 2018 in New York City.
