Beijing is exporting its authoritarian values around the world, Ho said.\n\n\u201cThe only way to counter this global suppression is by hitting (China) where it really hurts,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Communist government doesn\u2019t care about any thing other than the economy. They don\u2019t care about human rights and they don\u2019t care about these universal values that we do have.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe see businesses profiting\u201d in China, she said. \u201cThere are a lot of U.S. companies that have been based in Shenzhen, and they have turned a blind eye to this issue, to these human issues.\u201d\n\nChina has denounced the protests and accused the United States and Britain of interfering in its affairs in Hong Kong. It has sent clear warnings that forceful intervention is possible.\n\nHo will testify with Joshua Wong, secretary-general of Hong Kong\u2019s Demosisto party and leader of the \u201cUmbrella Movement,\u201d and other activists in Congress on Tuesday at an event hosted by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC).\n\nU.S. lawmakers are fine-tuning a bipartisan bill that would require an annual review of the special treatment Washington gives Hong Kong, including trade and business privileges, under the U.S. Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992.\n\nThe Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act would also make officials in China and Hong Kong, who have undermined the city\u2019s autonomy, vulnerable to sanctions.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has been waging a tit-for-tat tariff war with China for more than a year, has suggested China should \u201chumanely\u201d settle the problem before a trade deal is reached.\n\nCredit rating agency Moody\u2019s on Monday lowered its outlook on Hong Kong\u2019s rating to negative from stable, reflecting what it called the rising risk of \u201can erosion in the strength of Hong Kong\u2019s institutions\u201d amid the city\u2019s ongoing protests.\n\nHo said the trade war had offered a \u201cprotective shield\u201d for the people of Hong Kong, sheltering them from a violent Beijing crackdown, such as the deployment of troops.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nIndustry groups worry that the bill threatens fragile U.S.-China trade talks, but Ho said passage would send a powerful signal to other countries and reaffirm U.S. leadership in the world.\n\n\u201cI believe that Hong Kong is in the front lines of this very global fight for humanity itself,\u201d she said.\n\n(This story corrects to lowers \u2018outlook\u2019, not \u2018ratings\u2019, in paragraph 11)", "description": "Hong Kong singer and activist Denise Ho wants U.S. lawmakers and companies to criticize Beijing's actions in Hong Kong, to help change the Chinese Communist Party's behavior.", "authors": ["Andrea Shalal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430653239&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G01U", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
