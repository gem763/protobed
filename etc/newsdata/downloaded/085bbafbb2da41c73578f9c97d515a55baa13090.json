Joe Kennedy Will Challenge Ed Markey for Senate Seat", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON\u2014 Rep. Joe Kennedy III, a member of one of America\u2019s great political dynasties, will challenge Ed Markey for his Massachusetts Senate seat, setting up a dogfight between two progressive lawmakers.\n\nMr. Kennedy\u2019s formal announcement is expected on Saturday, according to a person familiar with Mr. Kennedy\u2019s plans. Mr. Kennedy met with Mr. Markey on Wednesday to tell him that he planned to run, the person said.\n\nMr. Markey has served in the Senate since 2013, and has been in Congress since 1976, when he entered the House. He has said repeatedly in recent months that he plans to defend his seat.\n\n\u201cElections are about choices, and Ed looks forward to spending the next 14 months campaigning hard every day to show the people of the Commonwealth why he\u2019s the right choice,\u201d said John Walsh, a senior campaign adviser. \u201cFrom lowering drug prices for our seniors, to expanding opioid treatment and recovery services, to creating green jobs for our workers, Ed Markey is ready to continue the fight for Massachusetts.\u201d\n\nThe Boston Globe first reported that Mr. Kennedy planned to announce his run.\n\nSen. Ed Markey has been endorsed for re-election by a list of state and national lawmakers.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, both Democrats.\n\nBut Mr. Kennedy, who is a grandson of former U.S. senator and attorney general Robert F. Kennedy, is prepared to pitch himself as a younger, newer face to represent the Bay State. The 38-year-old is in his fourth term in Congress, compared with 73-year-old Mr. Markey\u2019s decades of service.\n\nIt remains to be seen what political path Mr. Kennedy will carve, as Mr. Markey is one of the more progressive Democratic senators in the caucus and has been outspoken on energy policy and climate change.\n\nThe person familiar with Mr. Kennedy\u2019s plans said the representative has done at least one poll that showed him ahead outside of the margin of error.\n\nWrite to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com", "description": "Rep.
