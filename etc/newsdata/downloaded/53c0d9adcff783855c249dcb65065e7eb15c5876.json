With the seating set up near the walls, the open space felt hugely generous \u2014 and more than a little symbolic. The designers, Mike Eckhaus and Zoe Latta, were in effect saying, \u201cWe have room to grow; that\u2019s how confident we are in our work.\u201d\n\nThis was Eckhaus and Latta\u2019s 19th collection, and from the start, they have been experimenting with fabrics (initially dead stock), and with conventional notions of beauty and luxury, without modifying the basic forms of clothing. They\u2019re not avant-garde wannabes, concocting jackets with three sleeves. Nor are they ransacking the archives of Margiela for his anti-luxury ideas, though their modest shapes, non-sexy shoes (now made with UGG), and homemade-looking knits fit in that category. And though they are hardly the first designers to cast artist and musician friends as models \u2014 a practice that goes back to the \u201980s \u2014 Latta and Eckhaus have certainly left their mark, especially with models who represent more contemporary attitudes about gender.\n\nSo it was striking to see this independent label, with its clear if quirky aesthetic and alignment with artists and museums \u2014 most recently the Whitney \u2014 take a conspicuous step toward the mainstream.\n\nEckhaus Latta Photo: Shutterstock\n\nThere was a more uniform quality to the manufacture of the knits and tailoring \u2014 not slick and \u201cflat\u201d exactly, but gone was the individual or hand-made feel that had characterized most of Eckhaus Latta\u2019s pieces.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not suggesting this is a disappointing change. Not at all. It is a move that almost every gifted and intelligent designer has to make to survive the horrendous challenges of staying in business.\n\nNonetheless, it was jolting to see how confidently Latta and Eckhaus had made the move, and with their aesthetic not only intact but expanded upon. They made three noteworthy additions. One was the use of girlish ruffles for knit dresses and tops and, best of all, pants with a muted zigzag pattern and a spree of ruffles at the cuffs. The second was to propose knitwear with a wider appeal \u2014 in fit as well as a refined, lightweight quality. The pattern might suggest Missoni\u2019s style, but my impression was that Latta and Eckhaus took care to make theirs distinctive. And finally, the third addition was sequins, for a pair of tank dresses and a sleeveless top, worn with a striped knit skirt. The designers made the glitzy embellishment their own by using two raunchy colors \u2014 royal blue and bright orange \u2014 and then proposing shapes that clearly had nothing to do with sex.\n\nAlso worth noting were the pantsuits. Though not new for the label, they are definitely more refined and particular, in dark jade and white, with oversize pants and a beautifully cut, natural-shoulder jacket.\n\nEckhaus Latta Photo: Shutterstock\n\nAcknowledging the changes backstage, the designers said they wanted their clothes to look more \u201cstraightforward.\u201d \u201cWe still work the same way we always have,\u201d Latta said, \u201cbut it might have gotten more micro in the details.\u201d Today, the scrappy brand that started with dead stock now produces in Portugal, Italy, China, Peru, and the U.S.\n\nThe other big shows of the day, Oscar de la Renta and Proenza Schouler, offer a contrasting view of how to stay relevant.\n\nThroughout his long career, the late de la Renta continually updated his style \u2014 the crisp tailoring in tweed and double-faced wool, the decorative knits, the sumptuous gowns. He had lots of references in his cultivated head, but, at the same time, he was attuned to what women would buy.\n\nCreative directors Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim, who both spent years working for de la Renta, operate the same way. They use references sparingly \u2014 this time, it\u2019s a breezy nod to de la Renta\u2019s Latin roots. They\u2019ve taken the layers and corsetry out of evening clothes in response to modern tastes. Among the best looks were floaty taffeta dresses hiked up in front and wispy, embroidered dresses in shades of blush, taupe, and silver. And they\u2019ve claimed the caftan, once a staple at Oscar (he mostly made them for private clients for entertaining at home). Of course, caftans are hot again. Theirs are in vivid colors, with well-done details, and for night in pleated gold lam\u00e9.\n\nOscar de la Renta Photo: Getty Images\n\nAnd in just a couple of years, Kim and Garcia have revamped Oscar\u2019s day-time image, generally keeping the suits off the runway and spotlighting knits and more versatile separates. Still, the signatures haven\u2019t been lost to change.\n\nThe trouble with Proenza Schouler is that designers Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough never really set down a recognizable signature. They were known for their experiments with novel material, and for themes or flourishes that had a contemporary-art-world connection. And like a lot of youngish designers, they sampled the ideas of others.\n\nBut now, with the retail and fashion industries under pressure, I had the feeling that maybe things are coming home to roost for Proenza. The designers, who have a new backer, said their aim was to evolve their last few collections, with an eye on softness. Hence the long, belted dresses in yellow or printed silk, the draped tops under blazers, and a slim, sleeveless dress with draping down the sides that (to me) looked like air-cooling fins.\n\nProenza Schouler Photo: Getty Images\n\nThe pantsuits were great. Perhaps, as McCollough said backstage when I asked him about Proenza\u2019s direction, it was the show\u2019s styling \u2014 the white stockings, the many belts, the bound ponytails \u2014 that caused things to look complicated, stilted. \u201cIf you strip it all away, it\u2019s pretty soft and simple,\u201d he said.\n\nBut I think he and Hernandez might be kidding themselves if they think the foundations don\u2019t need serious defining.", "description": "Fashion critic Cathy Horyn reviews the spring 2020 collections from Eckhaus Latta, Oscar de la Renta, and Proenza Schouler, for New York Fashion Week.", "authors": ["Cathy Horyn"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/11/cathy-post/11-cathy-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
