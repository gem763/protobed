It can\u2019t for example, unlock secret grand jury information, said Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nWorse yet, said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Mrs. Pelosi has yet to lay out any of the ground rules for impeachment.\n\nHe said until Democrats come up with a plan for calling witnesses, allowing access to evidence and giving President Trump\u2019s lawyers the ability to be part of the proceedings, there can\u2019t be a fair impeachment inquiry.\n\nEven Congress\u2019s own legal team at the Congressional Research Service said Mrs. Pelosi is trodding new ground in pursuing an impeachment path without getting the entire House on record and laying out clear rules of the road.\n\n\u201cIf the House takes no new action on authorizing the investigation, the speaker\u2019s statement that the House is launching an \u2018official impeachment inquiry\u2019 is unlikely to put to rest the debate,\u201d CRS analysts said in a legal memo this week.\n\nMrs. Pelosi last week reversed her longstanding reluctance to pursue impeachment and unilaterally declared that six House committees were now engaged in an inquiry that could lead to articles of impeachment.\n\nThe trigger, she said, was Mr. Trump\u2019s revelation that he asked Ukraine to investigate one of his political opponents, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.\n\nOn Thursday, Mrs. Pelosi rejected the suggestion that she needs to ask the full House to vote, saying her word is good enough.\n\n\u201cThe existing rules of the House provide House committees with full authority to conduct investigations for all matters under their jurisdiction, including impeachment investigations,\u201d she said in a letter to Mr. McCarthy.\n\n\u201cThere is no requirement under the Constitution, under House rules, or House precedent that the whole House vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry,\u201d she said.\n\nLaw professors said she may be right.\n\nThe Constitution says little about how impeachment takes place, only that the actual act of impeaching requires a vote. But there is no guidance on how to get to that point, and the Constitution gives both chambers the power to set their own rules.\n\nJonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University who was on the legal team during a 2010 impeachment trial of a federal judge, said courts may not appreciate Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s approach, which he said was \u201ccasual to the point of being conversational.\u201d\n\nBut he also said a judge is not likely to want to peer too deeply into House procedures.\n\n\u201cA court will make this inquiry and I expect the court is going to ask what determines that a formal impeachment investigation has begun,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the court\u2019s going to be delighted with the informality of the process thus far by the Democratic majority. But that does not mean they\u2019re going to lose.\n\n\u201cCourts have historically avoided dictating the procedures of the House,\u201d he added.\n\nIt turns out that quite a bit is riding on the question of whether an impeachment process is underway or not.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service said committees\u2019 ability to compel evidence is stronger if impeachment is at stake.\n\nPast presidents have voluntarily turned over confidential communications, and an impeachment inquiry could even pierce the veil of secrecy that usually protects grand jury information from release.\n\nThat\u2019s the issue in the case Mr. Collins, the top Judiciary Committee Republican, weighed in on Thursday.\n\nJudiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler has demanded the courts let him see grand jury information gathered by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian election meddling and Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior surrounding the 2016 election.\n\nHe\u2019s been arguing for months to the court that he has been engaged in an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe government had responded by pointing to Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s own words that the House wasn\u2019t pursuing impeachment.\n\nMr. Turley said Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s reversal last week may have been an effort to fix that problem and give new legal heft to Mr. Nadler\u2019s argument.\n\nMr. Collins, in his brief to the federal district court in Washington, said that\u2019s not good enough.\n\n\u201cAn impeachment inquiry was authorized, in explicit terms, by the full House in the two previous cases where presidents were impeached,\u201d Mr. Collins wrote in his brief. \u201cIndeed, in the [Judiciary] Committee\u2019s 206-year history, the committee has never reported articles of impeachment against a president without first conducting an impeachment proceeding authorized by a full House vote.\u201d\n\nMr. McCarthy, in his letter to Mrs. Pelosi, went further.\n\nHe said those impeachment inquiries had rules to make them fair for the president as well as Congress, including giving the president\u2019s lawyers the right to offer evidence and the right to cross-examine witnesses; to give subpoena powers to the minority party as well as the chairman; and to hold a specific vote authorizing the process.\n\n\u201cIf you are indeed sincere about overseeing a fair and objective process, meet the standards of your predecessors by establishing the procedures outlined above. Otherwise, I must again insist that you suspend all efforts surrounding your impeachment inquiry,\u201d the California Republican wrote.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
