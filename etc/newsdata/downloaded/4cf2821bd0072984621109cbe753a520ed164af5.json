This perhaps indicates that the position of LGBT+ people in society is under threat in future generations. \u201c\n\nGalop\u2019s report said the answers may reflect a \u201cthe influence of the rise of anti-LGBT+ rhetoric globally\u201d, following a rise in anti-trans activism among high-profile right-wing groups in the US and UK.\n\n\u201cIt may also be connected to the influence of a growing number of siloed online communities of hate, which exist with different social norms to mainstream society, running counter to inclusion and tolerance,\u201d it added.\n\nProtests that started in Birmingham over the teaching of relationship education in primary schools have sparked angry public debate and abuse on social media.\n\nGalop said the levels of bias against LGBT+ people in Britain may be higher than the findings of the poll, because respondents may have been reluctant to express bigotry.\n\nFigures released by the Home Office on Tuesday showed that a record number of hate crimes were reported to police in 2018-19, with the largest increases for anti-transgender incidents, which rocketed by 37 per cent to 2,333 incidents.\n\nCrimes motivated by sexual orientation rose by a quarter to 14,500 in the year.\n\nMr Antjoule said Galop had also recorded a \u201cstark increase in the severity and scale of anti-LGBT violence and abuse\u201d in recent years.\n\n\u201cThis appears to be a symptom of emergent anti-LGBT attitudes and social division across society,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe fact that anti-LGBT hate crime figures are rising so much faster than race, faith and disability hate crime should be a wake up call for policymakers.\u201d\n\nThe National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council urged people to report attacks and abuse and pledged that officers would take complaints seriously.\n\nAssistant chief constable Mark Hamilton, national lead for hate crime, said: \u201cThe 10 per cent increase reported today is in part due to increased confidence of victims to report to the police and continuing efforts by police to improve recording.\n\n\u201cHowever, these statistics also represent real rises in hate crime, and we are particularly concerned about the sharp increases in LGB and transgender abuse.\n\n\u201cWe also recognise there are real divisions in our society at this time, and there is a responsibility on us all to think carefully and be temperate in how we communicate with each other to avoid escalating tensions or emboldening others.\u201d\n\nA government spokesperson said it was working to improve prosecution rates for hate crime, adding: \u201cAny incident of hate crime is completely unacceptable.\n\n\u201cNo one should be targeted because a hateful minority cannot tolerate the differences that make our country great.\u201d\n\nIf you have experienced homophobic, biphobic or transphobic violence or abuse and need support, you can get in touch with Galop via advice@galop.org.uk, 020 77042040 or via the website www.galop.org.uk", "description": "Homophobia\u00a0is increasing among young British people, new research has suggested amid warnings that \u201conline communities of hate\u201d could be driving the worrying trend.
