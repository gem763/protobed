While the rally has strengthened South Africa\u2019s platinum industry, power and water shortages, rising crime and onerous regulations are deterring investment, the CEO said.\n\nThe plan to move Sibanye\u2019s primary listing isn\u2019t immediate and could still be two years out, after the company has sufficiently paid down its debt. The move is driven by commercial considerations and shouldn\u2019t be construed as leaving South Africa, where some of Sibanye\u2019s platinum mines could operate for more than 40 years, Froneman said.\n\n\u201cLooking offshore for growth is just a logical extension of where we are now,\u201d Froneman said. \u201cNo firm decision has been made, but I think if we are to grow, we would have to change our primary listing because there is no real growth in South Africa.\u201d\n\nShifting Sibanye\u2019s primary listing would expose the miner to a wider pool of investors and could also allow it to tap cheaper capital, said the CEO, who completed the acquisition of Lonmin in May, less than three years after buying Stillwater Mining in the US. Record palladium prices have made the Montana-based asset Sibanye\u2019s \u201ccrown jewel,\u201d Froneman said.\n\n\u201cIf you have a decent international portfolio of assets and you change primary listing, I daresay you get a re-rating because you become more acceptable,\u201d he said.\n\nPalladium broke above $1 800 an ounce on Monday as stricter air-quality rules increase demand for the metal used in vehicle pollution-control devices. Sibanye\u2019s shares have surged more than 160% this year.\n\nFroneman\u2019s deliberations come as AngloGold Ashanti sells its remaining gold assets in South Africa, viewed as a final step before moving its primary listing from Johannesburg. Anglo American Plc CEO Mark Cutifani has said there is no shortage of opportunities in South Africa, but to attract mining investment requires political stability and regulatory clarity.\n\nMiners are challenging aspects of the country\u2019s revised mining charter - which seeks to address inequalities resulting from apartheid - in court. While Sibanye has no intention to exit South Africa, some of the charter\u2019s provisions are sending \u201cinvestors running away,\u201d Froneman said.\n\n\u201cWhile we have the dispute in court, guess what, no one is going to invest,\u201d he said.", "description": "The group's Chief Executive Officer Neal Froneman says the move would be driven by commercial considerations.", "authors": ["Felix Njini"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4310/052c335f2dcc443cbfcfc7634e699a65.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
