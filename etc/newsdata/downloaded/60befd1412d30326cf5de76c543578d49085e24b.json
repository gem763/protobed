I still thought it was a waste of money. Then he made this. It's beautiful.\n\n\"At first when Robin showed me the lampshade, all I saw was this plain white shape and I was thinking 'do I say I like it just to make him feel good?'.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"Then he turned the light on and I was like 'wow that's really pretty'. I wasn't expecting it at all. I think it's brilliant.\n\n\"Robin isn't on social media but I knew it needed to be posted. I knew people would send loads of praise and he needed to see that.\n\n\"He has it set up as part of a lovely memorial to Heidi in his living room.\n\n\"First Robin had it set up in one spot but I suggested he move it near the door so when everyone goes to leave the house it's the last thing they see.\n\n\"They were together for more than 17 years. It's not my place to come in and say 'why is that there?'.\n\n\"I'm completely aware of how petty some people can be but I can't understand why something like this would bother anyone.\n\n\"If your future partner took issue with anything like that then they shouldn't be your future partner.\n\n\"Robin and Heidi had a whole life together and he is proud to show me his past. She is the person who made him who he is and made their kids who they are.\"\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nAfter suffering a stroke in 2013, Heidi was diagnosed with a genetic heart defect.\n\nThe mum had to be rushed to hospital 80 times between 2015 and 2019 with a heart rate so elevated that doctors had to administer an electric shock to reset the rhythm.\n\nDespite being placed on the heart transplant list, Heidi sadly passed away before she could have the life-saving surgery.\n\nAfter nearly three months in hospital, Heidi had texted Robin in the early hours of April 22 to say she was feeling better and would be able to come home in two days.\n\nRobin, of Vlierden, The Netherlands, replied to his partner 10 minutes later but Heidi never received his message as her heart had suddenly given out.\n\nDoctors performed CPR for 50 minutes while a distraught Robin 'put his foot down' for the 100-mile drive to the hospital, telephoning Maxine for comfort on the heartbreaking journey.\n\nFaced with rush hour traffic, it took Robin two and a half hours to get to Heidi and by then it was too late, leaving him riddled with guilt.\n\nThe dad then faced the devastating task of telling his little girls, who were visiting their grandad in England at the time, that their mum had died.\n\nRobin said: \"The doctors don't really know what happened. Heidi was doing really well, she had messaged me to say she could come home on Wednesday.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"Then suddenly she didn't feel well and pressed her button to call the doctors. Ten minutes later she was being rushed to the ICU and 20 minutes later they were performing CPR.\n\n\"They called me as she was being rushed into the emergency room. It's the worst phone call of my life.\n\n\"I dropped everything and put my foot down to get there. They tell you to drive carefully but in that situation you don't drive carefully.\n\n\"I ran into the hospital and about six or seven doctors came to meet me. Before they could say anything, I could already see it on their faces.\n\n\"The main doctor explained to me that Heidi's heart had suddenly started shutting down. He told me they performed CPR for 50 minutes because they didn't want to give up.\n\n\"I called my dad and told him. I asked him not to tell the girls anything yet but to bring them home.\n\n\"They got here the next morning and I'd been up all night thinking about how I was going to tell them.\n\n\"They knew their mum was very sick so it wasn't a shock but it was still so difficult. Nobody should ever have to tell their little girls that they have lost their mum.\n\n\"Every night I put them to bed and five minutes later Nikki will call me back to her and tell me 'papa, I miss mama'.\n\n\"Krissy doesn't cry very often but when she does, everyone cries.\"\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nAfter losing Heidi, Robin went into 'dad mode' and became completely focussed on making sure his daughter's were okay.\n\nAt first, Robin admits it even felt like a weight had been lifted without the constant stress and worry of Heidi being so unwell.\n\nBut when Nikki and Krissy went back to school, the loneliness and devastation of losing his first love properly sunk in and Robin broke down.\n\nTo add to the dad's anguish, his mum Doroth\u00e9 Brandes had also died aged 70 just four weeks before Heidi's passing.\n\nDetermined to channel his grief, Robin set about creating a memorial corner for Heidi and came up with a plan to make a lampshade etched with her photos.\n\nInspired by lithophane maker Thomas Brooks, Robin spent hundreds of pounds modifying, reprogramming and writing new software for the 3D printer Heidi bought him in order to make his masterpiece.\n\nOne hundred hours of printing later and Robin has a stunning lampshade covered with pictures of Heidi and Nikki - and hopes to create a second featuring Krissy and her mum.\n\nAs well as bringing him joy, the light-up memorial is a huge comfort to Robin's daughters who love to look at it before bedtime and bring their friends to see it.\n\nRobin said: \"The aftermath of losing Heidi came quite a lot later.\n\n\"At first, all the stress and worrying about Heidi being so sick was lifted and I went into fullscale dad mode making sure the girls were okay.\n\n\"People were at the house every single day making sure we were all alright.\n\n\"Then after that first month, the girls went back to school and people stopped coming around.\n\n\"Suddenly it was really quiet in the house and I was alone. It started to sink in more and more that I'd lost Heidi.\n\n\"I went really downhill. I started rambling and my thoughts were rampaging through my mind.\n\n\"Everyone tells you 'you can't blame yourself' but you still do. I blamed myself for not being there.\n\n\"I couldn't sleep and I was having really bad nightmares. It breaks you down.\n\n\"I decided I wanted to do something in the house for Heidi. My first thoughts were that I was going to put pictures of her everywhere but I knew deep down that wasn't a good idea.\n\n\"So I decided on a memorial corner in the living room and to make the lampshades.\n\n\"The girls love it. It really helps for them to have that memorial to their mum. So often I catch them stood there. Nikki will stop there every night on her way to bed and look at the pictures.\"\n\nMaxine said: \"Robin and I have known each other and been chatting for years and years.\n\n\"Over the last four years we became best friends and started speaking more and more. We talk every day.\n\n\"When Heidi was going through everything with her condition, I became Robin's shoulder to lean on.\n\n\"I had my own stuff going on and we were there for each other as friends through it all.\n\n\"Then over the summer, our friendship grew into what we are now. It all just fell into place really naturally.\n\nRobin is sure Heidi would be supportive of his relationship with Maxine and thinks that if she is looking down on them, she will be happy to see someone making her family 'smile and laugh'.\n\nRobin said: \"I'm not a religious person but if Heidi is looking down she would see that all three of us are happy when Maxine is around.\n\n\"When Maxine is here, we are able to smile and laugh but when Maxine isn't here we struggle to smile.\n\n\"I think seeing us happy would be enough for Heidi.\"\n\nThe dad is now using the Facebook page Maxine set up for him, Dronky's 3D Prints, to make more customised lampshades for others who've suffered a tragic loss.", "description": "Dad-of-two Robin van Esch dedicated himself to creating a 3D-printed lampshade for partner of 17 years Heidi van Otterdijk after she passed away in April", "authors": ["Kim Reader", "Image", "Kennedy News", "Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20552733.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-KNM_SHRINE_FOR_DEAD_EX_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
