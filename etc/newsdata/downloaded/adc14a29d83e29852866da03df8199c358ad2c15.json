Turn Against Trump?", "language": "en", "text": "I\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use \u201cliberal\u201d as an epithet, but that\u2019s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I\u2019ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.\n\nDavid Leonhardt\n\nImage\n\nI\u2019ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago \u2014 first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I\u2019ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at Businessweek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.\n\nMy politics are left of center. But I\u2019m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today\u2019s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges \u2014 inequality, climate change, the rise of China \u2014 and they\u2019ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.", "description": "Whose armrest is it anyway?
