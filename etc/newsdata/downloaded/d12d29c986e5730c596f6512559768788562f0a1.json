Pythons are members of the Pythonidae family of snakes. There are about 26 different species within this family.\n\nThey kill their prey through constriction, literally by squeezing the animal to death. Venomous snakes, on the other hand, kill their prey by biting and injecting venom through hollow fangs or teeth.", "description": "According to reports, soon after the video went viral Forest Department started an investigation in the matter on the basis of the video.
