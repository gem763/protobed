Which doesn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t so nervous before showing them the script for the first time that he had to go into therapy.\n\n\u201cIt ended up being great, but I was really scared,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a sort of quiet and affable presence in my family, and this felt like such a declaration of how much I\u2019d been listening and absorbing.\u201d\n\nHe grew up in Texas, where his parents ran a cultural organization connected with the University of Dallas, a Catholic institution. It was a home full of art and argument, he recalls, where dinner-table conversation was likely to include discussion of Machiavelli, Shakespeare and St. Augustine.\n\nHe wrote and acted in plays at an all-boys school run by Hungarian monks, and also devoured every movie he could find at the public library.\n\n\u201cI always felt a tension between the very rich, complex, nuanced, passionate hive of ideas and faith that was my household, and all the beauty of everything else and everyone else,\u201d Arbery said. \u201cI was always pulled between those two, and endlessly curious about everyone else.\u201d\n\nHe began the process of \u201cuncoiling,\u201d as he puts it, at the secular Kenyon College , where he majored in English and drama, and attended Mass regularly until about halfway through his junior year.\n\nToday, Arbery \u2014 who wears hipster-nerd glasses and described his plays as partly about \u201cunpacking whiteness\u201d \u2014 might blend in with any number of self-questioning, progressive-minded young artists in Brooklyn. Asked about his current relationship to Catholicism, Arbery, already given to thoughtful pauses, paused even longer.", "description": "Will Arbery has brought the world of ultraconservative Catholic intellectuals to the stage in \u201cHeroes of the Fourth Turning.\u201d He\u2019s pleased that they appreciate being seen, not judged.", "authors": ["Jennifer Schuessler"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/14/arts/13CONSERVPLAY1/13CONSERVPLAY1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
