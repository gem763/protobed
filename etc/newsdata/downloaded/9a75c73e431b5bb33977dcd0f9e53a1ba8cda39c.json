I\u2019m insisting that Donald Trump be given the same rights that any American has if you\u2019re giving a parking ticket to confront the witnesses against you: can\u2019t be based on hearsay. And here\u2019s the point of the resolution: Any impeachment vote based on this process, to me, is illegitimate, is unconstitutional, and should be dismissed in the Senate without a trial.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Mediaite.Com Tv Lindsey-Graham-Plans-To-Introduce-Resolution-Condemning-Illegitimate-House-Impeachment-Should-Be-Dismissed-In-Senate-Without-A-Trial"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
