The move comes as the administration is struggling to combat an intensifying investigation into President Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nEach of the districts on Pence\u2019s itinerary were won by Trump in 2016, making them potent targets for Republicans. The vice president will travel Wednesday to the southwest Iowa district of Rep. Cindy Axne, and Thursday he\u2019s slated to visit the suburban Twin Cities district of another freshman Democrat, Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig. The vice president is then scheduled to barnstorm an array of battleground districts, including those held by Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger.\n\nThe deployment comes as the White House has been flailing for a focused response to the escalating probe into whether Trump improperly pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. The president veered wildly over the weekend, accusing Democrats of \u201cinterfering in the 2020 Election\u201d and calling Republican Sen. Mitt Romney a \u201cpompous \u2018ass\u2019\u201d who failed to understand that \u201cmy conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
