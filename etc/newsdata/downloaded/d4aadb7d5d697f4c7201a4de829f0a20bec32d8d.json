The likes of Lionel Messi, Roger Federer, Virat Kohli, and many other illustrious names.\n\nThese are the sports stars that have mastered the art of winning and dominated their respective fields. Yet, there are some athletes who have not only won laurels, but crafted their way to glory on countless occasions and written an alternate history for themselves.\n\nThere are sports stars who have ridiculous records to their names. What we are talking about are the records, we are making a reference to the unprecedented feats achieved, that look too mythical to be ever broke. It takes a special kind of crazy to do something no one else has done.\n\nThe journey of a record breaker is far from normal, but it produces some spectacular results. The following are a number of insane sports records that defy imagination.\n\nYou don't have to understand them, all you got to do is respect the unexpected.\n\nMichael Phelps\n\nFacebook\n\nDon't Miss 1.8 K SHARES 673 SHARES 1.7 K SHARES\n\nThe sight of Michael Phelps swimming was like someone just walking over water. It looked all too simple to him, he could cross oceans in no time, and come back with a smile on his face.\n\nAt a tender age of 15, Phelps made his Olympic Games bow in 2000. Although he didn't win a medal, it was a beginning of a great love affair between Phelps and Olympics. It was in the 2004 edition of the Olympics that the legend of Michael Phelps was born.\n\nIn an incredible showing at the Athens Olympics, he won a ludicrous six gold medals, and two bronze medals. In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won his first Olympic gold medal in the world record time of 4:08.26.\n\nHe followed it up with another five in the other freestyle and butterfly events. Also, adding two bronze medals to his name. It was the start of a special and glittering career.\n\nThe 2008 Beijing Olympics saw Michael Phelps shatter the record books and canter his name to unprecedented heights, winning an insane eight gold medals.\n\nAnother four gold, and two silver medals followed in the 2012 London Olympics. after the another rich haul of medals, Phelps announced retirement only to return in 2014.\n\nHe went to 2016 Olympics, and did what he did best - win medals a plenty. Five gold, and a silver is what Phelps walked away with. He only targeted gold.\n\nMichael Phelps won a total of 28 Olympic medals - 23 gold medals, 3 silver and 2 bronze. It is carnage and absolutely insane. It is a record that will take some beating. It looks impossible to get close to, but stranger things have happened.\n\n\n\nSimone Biles\n\nAFP\n\nThe 22 year-old gymnast from United States has been the best in the circuit for a few years now.\n\nBiles is a five-time World all-around champion (2013\u201315, 2018\u201319), five-time World floor exercise champion (2013\u201315, 2018-19), three-time World balance beam champion (2014\u201315, 2019), two-time World vault champion (2018-19), a six-time United States national all-around champion (2013\u201316, 2018\u201319), and a member of the gold-medal-winning American teams at the 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.\n\nRecently during World Championships, Biles won her 24th medal surpassing Scherbo's record and making Biles the sole record holder for most World Championship medals won by a gymnast of any gender. She went one better again, when she won her 25th medals at the tournament\n\nBy winning five gold medals at the 2019 championships, Biles tied the record of most gold medals won at a single World Championships with Larisa Latynina and Boris Shakhlin.\n\nIan Millar\u2019s 10 consecutive Olympic appearances\n\nAP\n\nIn 2012, the then 65-year-old Canadian equestrian rider Ian Millar set an Olympic record by making his 10th appearance in the Olympic Games \u2014 a streak that began back in 1972, a Summer Games in Munich.\n\nOnly two other Olympians have made nine appearances: 53-year-old Slovenian sharpshooter Rajmond Debevec, who has eight games under his belt but did not receive a bid for a ninth appearance in Rio.\n\nSachin Tendulkar\n\nGetty Images\n\nOne of the greatest cricketers to ever grace the planet, Sachin Tendulkar is a name you most definitely must have heard. In a career spanning 24 years, he went on to achieve feats nobody had dared to even imagine.\n\nOver 34,000 internationals runs, 100 hundreds, and 164 fifties, he went on to score truckloads of runs and created some insane records on his way to achieve a glamorous and richly successful career.\n\nNo one has quite come close to his career runs and centuries, and there is always a talk about someone like current Indian captain Virat Kohli, to be the man to break Tendulkar's records. It could happen, Virat Kohli might come close or even surpass some of the records set the the Master Blaster.\n\nBut one record that looks impossible to break is the total career runs Sachin Tendulkar has - 34,347. Yes, that is quite a lot. It includes 18,426 in ODIs, and 15,921 in the longest format of the game.\n\nEven at the ridiculous pace at which Virat Kohli is scoring runs, beating 34,347 seems like a very tall order.\n\n\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s 38,387 NBA Points\n\nAP\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar played in the NBA for 20 seasons, which is far longer than the average pro basketball career. But he needed all those years to catch and then break one of the game\u2019s most coveted records \u2014 all-time points scored.\n\nBy averaging an solid 24.6 points per game for his entire career (even more impressive when you consider he dropped 15 ppg for his final two seasons), the six-time NBA champion recorded a massive 38,387 points in those two decades on the hardwood.", "description": "We have witnessed the greatness and class of many athletes over the years.
