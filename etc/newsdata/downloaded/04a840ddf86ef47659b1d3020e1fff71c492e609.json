You have an event you know is coming up, and you had all the notice in the world to book cheap plane tickets months out. For some reason, though, you just haven't done it, and it's crept up on you to the point where prices are now through the roof.\n\nThat problem gets compounded when this event is Thanksgiving, one of the busiest travel days of the entire year and a time when airfare prices are no joke. If you're in my boat \u2014 booking tickets six weeks out or less \u2014 here are some rewards credit card strategies that can help ease the pain.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which will far outweigh the value of any points or miles. It's important to practice financial discipline when using credit cards by paying your balances in full each month, making payments on time, and only spending what you can afford to pay back.\n\n1. Leverage airline partnerships\n\nWith airlines moving to dynamic pricing \u2014 that is, award prices that fluctuate and tend to align more closely to a ticket's cash price \u2014 you're likely to find prices in miles that look pretty steep, particularly on Delta and United. And this is where airline partnerships come in. You can often find the exact same award ticket for fewer points on a partner airline, which is why the ability to transfer points \u2014 earned with credit cards including the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card and the American Express\u00ae Gold Card \u2014 to a range of different partners is so important.\n\nIf Delta is committing highway robbery with its SkyMiles prices, try looking for award space on Virgin Atlantic. If you're striking out on United, see if you can find your flights on Avianca. British Airways, with its distance-based award chart, often fields better award-ticket prices for Alaska and American flights than those airlines do for their own flights (although note that you'll have to call British Airways to book Alaska flights).\n\n2. Look to credit card travel portals\n\nOf course, the easiest thing to do when award space is pricey \u2014 or scant \u2014 is use your points to book a cash ticket for free. Holders of the Chase Sapphire Reserve, for example, can book any flight they want through the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel portal at a rate of 1.5 cents per point \u2014 compared to just 1 cent per point if you don't have a premium Chase card. It's a great strategy for when award prices are off the charts or you just can't find award availability on your route.\n\nWhile it won't yield quite the same value, using the Purchase Eraser feature from the Capital One\u00ae Venture\u00ae Rewards Credit Card is another way to achieve the same result \u2014 you can redeem miles to cover travel purchases on your card statement.\n\nOn the flip side, if you have the Business Platinum\u00ae Card from American Express, you can get even better value, though it's a little more complicated. Cardholders will get a 35% rebate in points for business and first-class tickets booked through Amex, or for economy tickets booked through Amex on a single airline they've preselected for the year\u2014the same airline for which they receive the airline fee credits that come as a perk of the card.\n\nOne bonus of booking through a portal or using your purchase eraser? Since these are revenue tickets, you'll still earn redeemable airline miles when you fly, so you can work toward your next trip booked on miles. You'll also earn qualifying miles and dollars toward airline elite status.\n\n3. Book something flexible\n\nIf you're dragging your feet because you don't quite know what your plans are yet, I have two words for you: Southwest Airlines. Instead of watching award and cash prices tick higher with every passing day, snag an award ticket on Southwest \u2014 you can always change or cancel it later with no penalty.\n\nNo Southwest Rapid Rewards points? No problem. Southwest is a transfer partner of Chase Ultimate Rewards, and you can earn its points through cards including the Chase Sapphire Preferred.\n\nNow, I know what some of you are thinking: Better to save those Ultimate Rewards points for international business class so you can really maximize their value. And it's true that you're definitely not going to be winning any \"best redemption\" awards by transferring to Southwest. But at the end of the day, if what you need is to lock in a flexible ticket without spending cash, this could be the way to go.\n\n(Do take note that if you do transfer from Chase, while Southwest may let you cancel your award ticket and get your points back, you won't be able to transfer them back to Chase. But with Southwest's new-ish flights to Hawaii, you could argue that sitting on a stash of Rapid Rewards points isn't the worst thing in the world!)\n\nSouthwest, of course, isn't the only airline that'll let you change or cancel an award ticket, but with other airlines, you're likely to see some kind of change or redeposit fee associated with the move. Something to investigate before you book!\n\n4. Take a gamble\n\nIt's no secret that you can often find the lowest-priced flights, both in miles and money, at undesirable times. If you're willing to accept the fact that you might end up stuck with it, you can always go for one of the low-priced tickets and try your luck at a same-day flight change.\n\nAirlines differ on what type of changes they allow \u2014 and whether or not they'll charge you, which often depends on your elite status or lack thereof \u2014 so make sure to read up on your airline's policies if you think you might go for it. Also, remember that your ability to move to a different flight depends on availability, which is generally pretty scarce on, say, the Sunday after Thanksgiving. But you never know!\n\n(In case you're doubting that this is actually possible: I've had a friendly gate agent, apparently in the giving mood, make this type of switch for me free of charge on the Sunday after Thanksgiving \u2014 and he even let me change the city I was flying into from Baltimore to Washington, D.C.
