We haven't had a chance to tell our stories on what these allegations say that could have transpired. I put the emphasis on allegations.\"\n\nThe Jayhawks received the NCAA notice of allegations late last month accusing the school of major violations tied to recruiting and a responsibility charge leveled against Self, along with a lack of institutional control.\n\n\"There is still a story that hasn't been told, and that's our story,\" Self said. \"That will be told in a way that is consistent with the NCAA process. When it's the right timing to do that, I very much look forward to that day.\"\n\nKansas coach Bill Self watches his team play against Auburn in the second round of the 2019 NCAA tournament.

Vasquez, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nSelf lashed out at the media for suggesting he had intent to taunt the NCAA for a promotional video and performance by Snoop Dogg at the program's \"Late Night at the Phog\" last week. Self was seen wearing an Adidas shirt in a promotional video. The school apologized for the Snoop Dogg performance which featured dancers with polls.\n\nThe notice from the NCAA last week does not detail what Kansas is accused of doing, but it is among the most prominent to surface during an FBI investigation into Adidas \u2014 the school's longtime sponsor. Among the allegations in that case is that an Adidas employee funneled money from the company to recruits.\n\nMESSAGE SENT: NCAA notice of allegations tell Bill Self: You're a cheater\n\n\u201cThat has actually been a narrative that some people have used since this. \u2026 If you\u2019ve followed us, I do stuff for Late Night every year. This year was no different,\" Self explained. \"I just happened to be wearing an Adidas shirt (in the video), who just happens to be our sponsor for our next 14 years that helped sponsor the event. It was innocently given to me and I just put it on.\n\n\u201cI do not like the narrative that has been said with that concerning me. But I also understand that I can\u2019t control what the media writes or their opinions. I do know and people who know me know that that\u2019s not factually true in any way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nSelf also addressed California's \"Fair Pay to Play\" law that will allow college athletes to profit off their name, image and likeness.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s been long overdue to give student-athletes the same opportunities that general students possess,\u201d Self said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that says a general student can\u2019t go to school, be on scholarship, and go work, make money on the side and do whatever.\"\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom signed California's last month, with the change set to take place by 2023. The law, in direct opposition to the NCAA's longtime amateur model forbidding profit, will allow the state's college athletes to hire agents and be paid for endorsements.\n\nSelf said he hopes there's a ripple effect, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t believe California, and New York, or South Carolina can have it and other states can\u2019t, so it\u2019ll be interesting how that all plays out.\u201d\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "description": "Kansas coach Bill Self said the school and basketball program will fight allegations from the NCAA that the Jayhawks committed major violations.", "authors": ["Scott Gleeson", "Published A.M.
