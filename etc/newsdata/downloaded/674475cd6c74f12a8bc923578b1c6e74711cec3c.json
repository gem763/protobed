UPDATE 1-U.S. natgas futures fall on lower demand forecasts\n\n(Adds closing prices)\n\nOct 7 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures fell on Monday on forecasts for less demand over the next two weeks than previously expected, allowing utilities to put more fuel in storage for the winter.\n\nFront-month gas futures for November delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) fell 4.9 cents, or 2.1%, to settle at $2.303 per million British thermal units.\n\nAs futures fell for a record 12 sessions in a row last week, gas speculators cut their long positions on the NYMEX 3023651MLNG to their lowest since May 2011, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data from Refinitiv. the spot market, power and gas prices for Monday fell to their lowest in years in several hubs, including gas in Chicago NG-CG-CH-SNL at its lowest since November 2001, power in New England EL-PK-NPMS-SNL at its lowest since June 2015, gas in New York NG-CG-NY-SNL at its lowest since September 2016 and gas at Dominion South NG-PCN-APP-SNL in Pennsylvania at its lowest since November 2017.\n\nData provider Refinitiv projected gas demand in the lower 48 U.S. states would reach 82.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) this week and 84.5 bcfd next week, down from its forecasts on Friday of 82.8 bcfd for this week and 84.6 bcfd for next week.\n\nTraders noted demand is expected to rise next week - though not as much as previously thought - as heating and liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports rise faster than power generator cooling demand declines.\n\nGas flows to LNG export plants held at 6.1 bcfd on Sunday, the same as last week's average, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nNext week, however, Refinitiv projected LNG exports would rise close to record highs of around 6.7 bcfd when Dominion Energy Inc's D.N Cove Point plant in Maryland returns to service. said utilities likely added 88 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas to storage during the week ended Oct. 4. That compares with an injection of 91 bcf during the same week last year and a five-year (2014-18) average build of 89 bcf for the period.\n\nIf correct, that increase would boost stockpiles to 3.405 trillion cubic feet (tcf), 0.6% below the five-year average of 3.424 tcf for this time of year.\n\nThe amount of gas in inventory has remained below the five-year average since September 2017. It fell as much as 33% below that in March 2019. But with production close to a record high, analysts said stockpiles should reach a near-normal 3.7 tcf by the end of summer injection season on Oct. 31. NGAS/POLL\n\nGas production in the lower 48 states eased to 92.4 bcfd on Monday due mostly to small declines in the Appalachian region, down from an average of 93.1 bcfd last week, according to Refinitiv data. That compares with an all-time daily high of 93.8 bcfd on Sept. 29.\n\nWeek ended Week ended Year ago Five-year\n\nOct 4\n\naverage\n\n4(Forecast 27(Actual)\n\nOct 4\n\nU.S. natgas storage (bcf):\n\nRefinitiv Heating (HDD), Cooling (CDD) and Total (TDD) Degree Days\n\nTwo-Week Total Forecast\n\nCurrent\n\nPrior Day\n\nPrior\n\n10-Year\n\n30-Year\n\nNorm U.S. GFS HDDs\n\n120 U.S. GFS CDDs\n\n43 U.S. GFS TDDs\n\nRefinitiv U.S. Weekly GFS Supply and Demand Forecasts\n\nPrior Week\n\nCurrent\n\nNext Week This week Five-Yea\n\nlast year\n\nAverage\n\nMonth U.S. Supply (bcfd)\n\nU.S. Lower 48 Dry Production\n\n75.5 U.S. Imports from Canada\n\n7.6 U.S. LNG Imports\n\n0.2 Total U.S. Supply\n\n100.2\n\nU.S. Demand (bcfd) U.S. Exports to Canada\n\n2.4 U.S. Exports to Mexico\n\n3.7 U.S. LNG Exports\n\n1.2 U.S. Commercial\n\n6.6 U.S. Residential\n\n6.8 U.S. Power Plant\n\n25.2 U.S. Industrial\n\n20.5 U.S. Plant Fuel\n\n4.6 U.S. Pipe Distribution\n\n1.9 U.S. Vehicle Fuel\n\n0.1 Total U.S. Consumption\n\n65.7 Total U.S. Demand\n\nSNL U.S. Natural Gas Next-Day Prices ($ per mmBtu)\n\nCurrent\n\nPrior Day\n\nHenry Hub NG-W-HH-SNL\n\nTransco Z6 New York NG-CG-NY-SNL\n\nPG&E Citygate NG-CG-PGE-SNL\n\nDominion South NG-PCN-APP-SNL\n\nChicago Citygate NG-CG-CH-SNL\n\nAlgonquin Citygate NG-CG-BS-SNL\n\nSoCal Citygate NG-SCL-CGT-SNL\n\nWaha Hub NG-WAH-WTX-SNL\n\nSNL U.S. Power Next-Day Prices ($ per megawatt-hour)\n\nCurrent\n\nPrior Day\n\nNew England EL-PK-NPMS-SNL\n\n16.50\n\n21.25\n\nPJM West EL-PK-PJMW-SNL\n\n21.50\n\n32.25\n\nErcot North EL-PK-ERTN-SNL\n\n80.00\n\n42.00\n\nMid C EL-PK-MIDC-SNL\n\n37.75\n\n31.25\n\nPalo Verde EL-PK-PLVD-SNL\n\n40.25\n\n25.00\n\nSP-15 EL-PK-SP15-SNL\n\n41.25\n\n27.50", "description": "U.S. natgas futures fall on lower demand forecasts", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC0E0N3_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
