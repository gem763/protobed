Second in the balloting was Dwight Clark\u2019s TD catch from Joe Montana that lifted San Francisco past Dallas to win the 1981 NFC championship.\n\nHarris\u2019 spectacular play not only lifted the Steelers to their first-ever playoff victory, it was the catalyst for the Steel Curtain dynasty that would win four Super Bowls from the 1974 through the 1979 seasons.\n\n\u201cThat play really represents our teams of the \u201870s,\u201d Harris said.\n\nWith 22 seconds remaining in the first-round matchup, and the ball at the Steelers 40-yard line, quarterback Terry Bradshaw scrambled under heavy pressure on fourth down. He heaved the ball downfield toward running back Frenchy Fuqua, and Raiders safety Jack \u201cThe Assassin\u201d Tatum arrived at the same time. The ball ricocheted wildly toward Harris near the left sideline. Before it hit the turf, he bent deeply and grabbed it before heading to the end zone.\n\nGame officials weren\u2019t sure who deflected the pass; had it gone off Fuqua, rules of the day would make it an incompletion. Referee Fred Swearingen, after consulting with NFL supervisor of officials Art McNally, ruled a touchdown. Pittsburgh kicked the extra point for a 13-7 lead with 5 seconds remaining and won a playoff game for the first time in franchise history.\n\n\u201cThere are moments in life where you know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Harris said. \u201cMe and Frenchy, we had no idea what we were doing.\u201d\n\nNeither did Steelers owner Art Rooney. Known as \u201cChief,\u201d Rooney had abandoned his seat and took the elevator to the locker room to be with his team after another postseason defeat. Chief didn\u2019t see the greatest play in franchise (and league) history pulled off.\n\nHis son, Dan, who would take over administration of the team - and created the Rooney Rule for diversity in NFL job interviews - stayed upstairs and witnessed the drama as Swearingen and McNally spoke on the phone. After Swearingen raised both arms to signal touchdown, and the Raiders could do nothing with the ensuing kickoff, Rooney at last felt relief.\n\n\u201cAfter that, I loafed around the press box. After a while, I went out and down to the dressing room. Everybody was on Cloud 9, cheering each other, all excited,\u201d he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in 2012. \u201cIt may have been the most exciting game I had seen up until that time.\u201d\n\nClearly, the voting panel found the Immaculate Reception as a runaway for best play as part of the NFL\u2019s celebration of its 100th season. Montana to Clark, known as \u201cThe Catch,\u201d received 3,099 points but only four first-place selections. The runner-up in first-place votes was David Tyree\u2019s \u201cHelmet Catch\u201d for the Giants as they rallied to beat the Patriots in the 2008 Super Bowl.\n\nHarris\u2019 catch eventually led to a rules change, too, with offensive players consecutively touching a pass being permitted. That eased officiating decisions on deflected balls, of course.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t ease the angst felt by Tatum or his coach, John Madden - like Harris and Bradshaw, a Pro Football Hall of Famer.\n\n\u201cHere was my point,\u201d Madden told the CBS affiliate in San Francisco in 2012. \u201cThey didn\u2019t call it a touchdown. And they were standing in the end zone, the officials, and discussing the play. \u2026 They talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, and still haven\u2019t said it\u2019s a touchdown. \u2026 This goes on 15 minutes.\n\n\u201cIf you knew it was a touchdown, you should have called it. If you didn\u2019t call it, you didn\u2019t know it was a touchdown. If you didn\u2019t know it was a touchdown, how did you decide that it was? That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Immaculate indeed.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Barry Wilner"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/nfl_at_100_greatest_play_04770_c0-187-4590-2863_s1770x1032.jpg?4ba58377f2e1f86709e60f8a80acef6411ca9d67", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
