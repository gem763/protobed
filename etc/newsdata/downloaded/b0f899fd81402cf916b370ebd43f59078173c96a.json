She always followed her heart. She always had the courage to do what she thought was right.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Internationally known for her lavish lifestyle and glam taste, silver screen siren Elizabeth Taylor also boasted a playful side, and now some of her personal effects that bared it are hitting the auction block.
