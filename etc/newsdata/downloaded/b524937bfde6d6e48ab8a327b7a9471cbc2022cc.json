It includes all of the pricing for things like packages and options, allowing you to estimate how much your ideal 760-horsepower 'Stang will cost. One of the more shocking numbers we've seen in the configurator is the price for painted racing stripes: $10,000. Yep, ten thousand dollars. That is a lot of money for some stripes.\n\nGranted, Ford also lets you option vinyl stripes, which look nearly identical and cost $9,000 less. But still, if you want the stripes painted on, asking used Fiesta ST money to have it done seems like a bit much, even if this is the most capable, powerful Mustang ever.\n\nThe pricing news doesn't stop there. The carbon fiber track pack is nearly twice as much as the stripes, at $18,500. That being said, it does include a good amount of upgrades, including carbon fiber wheels wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires, Recaro front seats, a rear seat delete, a carbon fiber instrument panel, a raised carbon fiber rear wing, and splitter wickers. If you'd rather not add nearly $20,000 to the car's base price, Ford has a more basic handling package for $1500, which gets you a Gurney flap in the rear and splitter wickers, but none of the carbon fiber bits or seating changes.\n\nThere's also a $3000 technology package, which includes a 12-speaker Bang & Olufsen sound system, blind spot monitoring, a voice activated infotainment system with Navigation and satellite radio, and a six-way adjustable driver's seat with three memory settings.\n\nThe configurator is up and running on Ford's website, so head on over if you want to check it out for yourself. Just don't be surprised if you end up with a Mustang priced over the six-figure mark.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "And that's not even the most expensive option.", "authors": ["Brian Silvestro"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DLwxDRIWFNO3U4.yhwSjXQ--~B/aD00Mzg7dz04Nzc7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/road_track_223/ad6aad21c99a6cc0ed526898af9c375f"}
