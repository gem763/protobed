United, and Jamie Vardy, a striker, who used to play alongside Rooney in the English national soccer team.\n\nColeen Rooney explained in a lengthy social-media post that she had set out to uncover the mole in her closed Instagram group who was leaking personal stories to the newspapers. By a process of elimination\u2014she eventually blocked all but one of her followers from seeing her Insta stories\u2014she planted fake stories and waited to see if they would appear in the British tabloid newspaper The Sun.\n\nThe latest of these concerned the basement of her house being flooded; The Sun hastily removed the story from its website today. Another claimed the Rooneys were planning to jet to Mexico for gender-selection treatment.\n\nThe only account left to read these totally false stories belonged to one Rebekah Vardy.\n\nColeen\u2019s next move was to take to Twitter and Instagram to blow the whistle on her fellow WAG\u2014British tabloid slang for the wives and girlfriends of soccer stars.\n\nSocial-media users and British journalists\u2014outside of The Sun newspaper\u2014hooted with delight at the detective work of the D.C. United star\u2019s partner who was soon dubbed \u201cWAGatha Christie.\u201d\n\nRebekah Vardy was quick to launch a speedy counterattack of the kind that made her husband famous on the sports field. She said Coleen was wrong to accuse her of leaking the stories and should have called her first. She suggested that her own Instagram account must have been hacked and accessed by a third party, who was then feeding the private stories to The Sun.\n\nThe meme-loving referees of social media seem to have come down almost unanimously on Rooney\u2019s side.\n\nThere have been persistent rumors that, off the field, they and especially their wives, didn\u2019t get along, despite the women being pictured sitting together in the bleachers cheering on their spouses during England\u2019s unsuccessful Euro 2016 campaign. Those rumors exploded into the public on Wednesday.\n\nThe bad blood is believed to go back to the ill-fated 2016 tournament. At the time, former England boss Roy Hodgson, asked about the alleged rift, said: \u201cI haven\u2019t got a clue what you are referring to. There are absolutely no problems in football terms between Wayne Rooney and Jamie Vardy. In fact quite the reverse, they are very close friends, both on the field and off the field.\u201d\n\nThat supposed friendship now looks about as likely as the U.S. winning the 2022 Men\u2019s World Cup.", "description": "Their husbands are both legends of British sport, but rumors of a difficult relationship off the field burst into the open today with a dramatic online fight between their wives.", "authors": ["Tom Sykes"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_576,w_1024,x_0,y_23/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570618073/GettyImages-173102808_ofryql", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
