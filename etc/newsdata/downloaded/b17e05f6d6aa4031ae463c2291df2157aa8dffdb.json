It will also be free for one year with purchases of new Apple devices. This is relatively rare for a company that has historically charged premium prices to support healthy profit margins.\n\nRod Hall, the Goldman Sachs analyst who covers Apple, cut his price target on Apple shares to $165 from $187, saying the company\u2019s plan to offer a trial period for TV+ was \u201clikely to have a material negative impact\u201d on average selling prices and earnings per share.\n\n\u201cWe do not expect the introduction of Apple TV+, including the accounting treatment for the service, to have a material impact on our financial results,\u201d Apple said in an email.\n\nThe stock jumped after the statement, trimming losses from earlier in the day. It traded down 1.8% at $219 at 2:56 p.m. in New York.\n\nThe TV+ service is entering a crowded video-streaming field that already includes Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Hulu and AT&T Inc.\u2019s HBO. In November, Walt Disney Co. plans to launch a Disney+ streaming service, with a giant catalog of titles, for $6.99 a month. Netflix\u2019s entry-level subscription is $8.99 a month in the U.S.\n\nApple, which doesn\u2019t currently have a back catalog of content for TV+, announced the $4.99-a-month pricing on Tuesday, sparking a rally in its shares and declines in Netflix and Disney stock. In India, the TV+ service will be 99 rupees ($1.40) a month.\n\n(Updates with background on TV+ in final paragraphs.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.net;Nico Grant in San Francisco at ngrant20@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. said a new video service won\u2019t have a material impact on its financial results, seeking to counter research from a Goldman Sachs analyst who cut his share price target on concern that aggressive pricing of the TV+ offering will trim profit.Earlier this week, Apple outlined a", "authors": ["Mark Gurman", "Nico Grant"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yxYQgV55jDYmK_LO2M.dhA--~B/aD0xMjcwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/35e8056e362bef129dad79d2e8bba421", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
