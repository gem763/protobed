The outstanding features and poor features are apparent to everybody,\u201d Southgate told reporters.\n\n\u201cPoor individual mistakes, a poor start. I like the way we showed the composure to recover from that initial mistake and our use of the ball throughout the first half was excellent.\n\n\u201cThe small period after half-time: ridiculous mistakes, poor decisions, lack of covering back. We made the game uncomfortable for ourselves. There were mistakes that were concerning ... they were such basic errors ... that you have to learn from.\u201d\n\nEngland lead Group A with 12 points and can qualify for the finals of the tournament with a win away to the Czech Republic in their next game on Oct. 11.\n\nSeparately, FA technical director Les Reed said it would be difficult to retain Southgate\u2019s services if the former England international decides to manage in the Premier League.\n\nSouthgate guided England to the semi-finals of the World Cup in Russia last year and third place in the Nations League in June, making him a sough-after coach.\n\n\u201cIt would be a tough ask depending on what he was offered,\u201d Reed told Sky Sports.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that we have in the back of our minds all the time but I know that Gareth\u2019s motivation is with this team and developing this team moving forward ... he wants to be an England manager that wins something,\u201d he said.", "description": "England must tighten up at the back by learning from \"ridiculous mistakes\" during their 5-3 Euro 2020 qualifying win over Kosovo on Tuesday, manager Gareth Southgate has said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428580653&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0BH", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
