After 2012, there was a two-year gap before Tales of Zestiria. The following year, Namco Bandai released Tales of Berseria. But since then, there hasn\u2019t been another Tales game. The next one, Tales of Arise, won\u2019t be out until 2020.\n\nSo why has there been such a long gap? During a studio visit last week, I asked producer Yusuke Tomizawa that question. \u201cIt\u2019s been several years since Tales of Berseria,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve switched to Unreal Engine 4. We want to bring in new players. That\u2019s where we are starting from and that\u2019s why it\u2019s taken so long.\u201d Plus, the goal is to release the game simultaneously worldwide next year. That, the producer adds, has also taken time.\n\n\u201cIn the past, there was a period in which we put out lots of Tales games,\u201d Tomizawa admitted. \u201cBut I\u2019m not saying we are only going to do a new Tales game every four or five years.\u201d\n\nTales of Arise appears to be a transitional game from the consecutive run of games in the 2000s but also a rethink of what a contemporary Tales game can be. From what Namco Bandai has shown, that looks promising.", "description": "Between 2002 and 2012, Bandai Namco released a mainline\u00a0Tales game almost every year, save for 2006 and 2010.
