They\u2019re also known to drop the hat themselves if they so feel like. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time talking about Antifa and the threat they represent to the United States and the constitution. In their zealous quest to supposedly combat fascism, they have become everything they swear they hate.\n\nYet right now, little of that matters.\n\nYou see, Saturday, an Antifa member was struck by a car and killed in a hit & run. Ordinarily, that wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. Tragic for his friends and family, sure, but not news worth talking about here at Bearing Arms.\n\nHowever, when the vehicle used then crashes into a Democratic Party office\u2026\n\nPortland Police say a prominent anti-fascist activist was killed early Saturday near Cider Riot, a Northeast Portland club and a popular gathering spot for left-wing protestors. Sean D. Kealiher, 23, was hit by an SUV a little after midnight. Friends drove him to the hospital, where he died. Someone fired shots at the SUV after it hit Kealiher, and the vehicle crashed by the headquarters of the Oregon Democratic Party. The hit and run is being investigated as a homicide, which under Oregon includes any killing another person \u201cintentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence,\u201d and police are asking anyone who has information on the incident to contact them. Rose City Antifa said in a tweet that Kealiher\u2019s death \u201cwas not related to fascist activity.\u201d No arrests have been made so far.\n\nCider Riot is apparently a known Antifa hangout.\n\nSo someone hit an Antifa member with an SUV, then drove it into the office of the political party that backs Antifa. I guess it could all be just a massive coincidence. It\u2019s possible that the driver didn\u2019t know who he or she hit, then just ran from the gunshots\u2013and that requires a bit of explanation\u2013and just smashed into a nearby office and the connections between the person and the office are just pure coincidence.\n\nBut forgive me if I say that this looks targetted to some degree.\n\nThe bar was a known Antifa hangout. I don\u2019t imagine it would be hard to figure out when Antifa members would be there and make a plan.\n\nIf this is an intentional act, I want to go on the record now as saying that this needs to end. Yes, Antifa gets violent. Yes, you have a right to defend yourself from violence. In fact, I encourage you to do just that.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t seem to be the case here. I\u2019ve looked at reports and haven\u2019t found anything where Kealiher was acting aggressively to anyone. This doesn\u2019t look like self-defense. At best, it looks like manslaughter to me, and that kind of thing doesn\u2019t help anyone except maybe Antifa. Now they can justify their violence. Now they can point out that they were right, we\u2019re all just a bunch of violent jackboots waiting for a chance to kill anyone we disagree with.\n\nGranted, they\u2019ll still hold with that even if it turns out the driver was just some drunk with really bad luck, but the last thing anyone needs to do is give them an excuse.", "description": "The car struck the man while he was crossing the street, then left and eventually crashed into a Democratic Party office.
