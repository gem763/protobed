We had some at the start of the season around the United game where he had a little go!\n\n\u2018It\u2019s all good. I\u2019ve sat in the punditry chair for a year so I understand the need to say things so I\u2019m certainly not going to bang on too much. In terms of him, yeah we have a relationship.\u2019\n\nLampard also says he speaks to his uncle, Harry Redknapp, about management. Redknapp has worked at the likes of West Ham, Portsmouth and Tottenham.\n\n\u2018Harry Redknapp is Uncle Harry so it would sound wrong if I didn\u2019t speak to him, but he was great for me in getting me the role at Derby,\u2019 Lampard added.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018He was close to Mel Morris [the chairman].

Guus Hiddink has actually sent me some great messages.\n\n\u2018But you move on a bit and it doesn\u2019t become like you were more acquaintances but I have huge respect for all of them.\u2019\n\nOn Saturday, Chelsea face a Newcastle side who stunned Manchester United prior to the international break but remain 16th in the Premier League.\n\nMORE: Virgil van Dijk reacts to Paul Pogba and David de Gea missing Manchester United v Liverpool", "description": "Frank Lampard has revealed he remains in contact with Jose Mourinho and says he spoke to the legendary manager after he 'had a little go' at Chelsea earlier in the...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Untitled-collage-97b8_1571392019.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
