Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nThe claim that proroguing happens is correct. This does happen all the time before new sessions of parliament. These moments all share a common thread: they last for only a matter of days, not weeks, and pause parliament without much, if any, surprise to open a new session.\n\nEverything is different about this time. If the government simply wanted to start a new session, they could do so by proroguing for one day. Three or more weeks is entirely unnecessary to achieve that goal.\n\nMoreover, suspending parliament was specifically ruled out only a few weeks ago by the prime minister and his chancellor. In June, Javid\u2019s campaign team to see him elected Tory leader tweeted (since deleted) that \u201cyou don\u2019t deliver democracy by trashing democracy\u201d, explicitly rejecting shutting down parliament to achieve Brexit.\n\nAfter winning the contest, a triumphant Johnson wrote to Tory members: \u201cI would like to make it absolutely clear that I am not attracted to arcane procedures such as the prorogation of parliament. As someone who aspires to be the prime minister of a democratic nation, I believe in finding consensus in the House of Commons\u201d.\n\nWithin weeks of taking high office, both Johnson and Javid have broken their promises and so, in their own words, have chosen \u201ctrashing\u201d democracy while making it \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d that they wish to preside over a less-than-democratic nation. Rarely have our most senior politicians either wilfully misled or U-turned so spectacularly on an issue of such fundamental constitutional importance.\n\nUnder the UK\u2019s constitution, the different branches act in light of recognised conventions. One is that the Queen acts on the advice of her ministers, such as in Johnson\u2019s request to suspend parliament. Her role should remain above partisan politics, and she probably had no option but to act on Johnson\u2019s advice or risk entering a political dispute whatever her possible legal entitlement to do other than requested.\n\nAt present, the courts are hearing cases including one brought by Gina Miller with support from former prime minister John Major that seek to find Johnson\u2019s request unlawful. Should they succeed, it would pour gasoline on the fire of constitutional outrage that Bercow and others see. This is because it would mean, on the request of her prime minister, the suspension of parliament by the Queen was unlawful and breached the constitution.\n\nOf course, any self-respecting prime minister thought to have crossed such a constitutional line would resign in shame. However, shamelessness mixed with a contempt for parliament lie at the centre of this government.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, has the notoriety of ensuring the previous Tory administration was found in contempt of parliament for refusing to publish his legal advice about Brexit. No government had ever been found in contempt before. Cox was then forced to do publish anyway.\n\nJohnson not only kept him in post, but it is on Cox\u2019s advice \u2013 will it be published? \u2013 that Johnson made his request to the Queen.\n\nJohnson\u2019s new chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, was found in contempt of parliament for refusing to answer select committee questions. Yet now he directs the political strategy and surely had some hand in the decision to suspend parliament.\n\nA government with senior figures at ease with breaking long-held, almost sacred constitutional conventions for the mere sake of securing victory by any means necessary represent a direct attack on our democracy and the cherished freedoms we enjoy as part of this system. The UK\u2019s constitution is under threat like never before in our lifetimes for the sake of playing a game of no-deal chicken with the EU that everybody outside 10 Downing Street can see for the farce it is.\n\nThe answer though, is not a written constitution which can be inflexible and unable to respond to new problems over time. Instead, our parliamentarians \u2013 in both the Commons and the Lords \u2013 have a duty to stand up and defend our constitution, especially when the government attempts to run roughshod over it. Their moment is next week.\n\n\u201cTake back control\u201d was supposed to be about empowering parliament, not usurping it. Leavers and Remainers might disagree about Brexit, but they must unite around something more important \u2013 our constitution. These are difficult to create and foster, but much easier to decay and destroy.\n\nIf we do not act now, the long-term damage will be felt for many years to come and the worst consequence yet of the division made possible by the rush to Brexit before having any clear idea how to achieve it or what it would look like.\n\nThom Brooks is Dean of Durham Law School and a professor of law and government", "description": "Depending on who you listen to, Boris Johnson\u2019s has either enacted a coup this week, or simply conducted some run-of-the-mill politics.
