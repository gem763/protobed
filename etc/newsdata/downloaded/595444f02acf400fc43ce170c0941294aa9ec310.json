Astros pitcher Brad Peacock fielded the ball and threw to first, hitting Turner in the process and sending the ball past first basemen Yuli Gurriel, whose glove also hit Turner and flew off.\n\nTurner advanced to second base on the error and the Yan Gomes reached third base.\n\nHowever, umpires called interference on Turner, ruling that he affected Gurriel's ability to catch the ball. Turner was called out and Gomes returned to first base.\n\nHere's a replay of Turner's run:\n\nPeople in the baseball world, from players to analysts, disagreed with the call.\n\nWhere was Turner supposed to run?\n\nTrea Turner. Rob Tringali/MLB Photos/Getty Images As seen in the tweets above, many felt that although Turner may have been too far inside the line during his run to first, he was right on target when he reached first base. The ball arrived at the same time Turner reached the bag. Some felt that Turner was punished for a poor throw from Peacock.\n\n\"For me, I mean, what else do you do?\" Turner said after the game (via ESPN's David Schoenfield). \"I don't know. The batter's box is in fair territory. First base is in fair territory. I swung, I ran in a straight line, I got hit with the ball and I'm out. I don't understand it.\"\n\nJoe Torre, the MLB's chief baseball officer, after the game offered a somewhat confusing interpretation. Torre noted that runners cannot be out of the line for the final 45 feet to the base. However, Torre said that's not what Turner was called for \u2014 he said it was for interfering with Gurriel.\n\n\"The call was the fact that [Turner] interfered with Gurriel trying to catch the ball,\" Torre told Fox Sports. \"You notice the glove came off his hand. That's when Sam Holbrook called him out for basically interference ... He made the right call.\"\n\nNationals manager Dave Martinez was ejected after the inning and had to be restrained from umpires. According to Schoenfield, Martinez is the first manager to be ejected from a World Series game since 1996.\n\nWhat about the review?\n\nAnother confusing and controversial aspect of the play was that the umpires gathered and appeared to be reviewing the play. However, the play was not reviewable, according to Torre, who said it was a \"judgment call,\" which umpires cannot review.\n\nTorre said that managers can ask umpires to review the rules if they disagree with a call. The umpires gathered and after four minutes and 32 seconds, they made their decision.\n\nAstros manager A.J. Hinch said after the game that it \"took a really long time for nothing to happen.\"\n\nAdding to the confusion, Martinez said after the game that he played the game under protest \u2014 except that the Nationals could not play the game under protest because the call was a judgment call.\n\n\"I know you can't protest a judgment call. I wanted him to \u2026 just look at the play, and (give) like a rule check,\" Martinez said (via The Athletic's Jayson Stark). \"We were told before the series started that we can ask for a rule check. But part of me just said, 'Hey, we'll protest the game \u2026 Just check the rules.' And they did that.\"\n\nThe Nationals got their revenge\n\nAfter much confusion, the play didn't end up costing the Nationals too much. Two batters later, Anthony Rendon hit a two-run home run to push the Nationals lead to 5-2.\n\nWhile the call on Turner was fairly inconsequential in the end, it only raises the stakes for Game 7. In a series where the umpires have been highly criticized for questionable calls, tensions are only higher heading into the series-deciding contest.", "description": "Between a questionable call, confusing review, ejection, and confusing explanation, Game 6 of the World Series had a lot of focus on the umpires.", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db9adb4dee019784806ca23?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
