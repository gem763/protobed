Business Insider Intelligence\n\nFor context, President Donald Trump stated via an August tweet that the US would impose at least a 10% tariff\u2014 alluding in further tweets that the rate could increase to 25% or higher \u2014 on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports, beginning September 1. The Trump administration has since delayed the proposed tariff increase to December 15 to avoid higher prices on consumer goods during the holiday season.\n\nBut the uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's long-term plans with Chinese imports has put the medtech industry on high alert: The US comprises more than 30% of China's medical device and diagnostics imports, per MedTech Dive. So, if the trade war heats up and China retaliates with increased tariffs on US imports, US companies could have serious difficulties maintaining a business presence in the region.\n\nHere's what the exemption means for healthcare organizations and the patients they serve:\n\nExemptions of Chinese medtech devices should help avoid a hike in the cost of care for routine procedures, like X-rays and MRI screenings. When news of Trump's proposed tariff increases first made impact last month, there were concerns that the increased cost of critical medtech components could significantly increase manufacturing costs.\n\nExecutives on several earnings calls warned about the potential consequences of an increased tariff rate, noting that the increased costs on company supply lines could shrivel their margins and that those costs may end up passed on to consumers as increased out-of-pocket costs and increased prices for basic health supplies, like latex gloves and bandages.\n\nAnd Michael Einhorn, president of medical supply distributor Dealmed, cautioned in an interview with Yahoo Finance that \"The reality is: costs will go up across the board\u2026 Not only because of tariffs, but because what's happening behind the scenes, and [that is] the disruption of the supply chain.\" Exempting many Chinese medtech components, like parts for X-ray machines and MRIs, should help stave off the worst of these potential impacts, at least for now.\n\nBut US medtech companies' future revenues abroad still hinge on the outcome of a US-China trade war that is quickly dissolving into a quagmire with no end in sight. For its part, China announced earlier this month that certain medtech components used in radiation oncology would be exempt from a 25% import tariff that had been slashing US companies' revenue throughout the summer months. For instance, California-based Varian Medical Systems reported that operating earnings plummeted $15 million in Q3 2019 as a result of the Chinese tariffs.\n\nIt's unknown what the primary motivating factor was for China's decision to exempt radiation oncology components. But the huge negative impact that China's tariffs had on US medtech companies illustrates how the US-China trade war has the potential to seriously derail the efforts of pioneering US companies, like Varian: Prior to China's exemption decision, Varian had cautioned its investors over what it predicted would be a $60 million loss due to the ongoing trade dispute.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
