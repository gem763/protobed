Um, why should anyone ever feel guilty about watching THE BEST TELEVISION SHOW OF ALL TIME?\n\nBut I must say, I do feel a bit guilty that I didn\u2019t recognize the star of two of my other favorite reality shows of the past, Celebrity Rehab and Loveline, under the Eagle\u2019s magnificent plumage.\n\nMost people think of addiction medicine specialist and relationship expert Dr. Drew Pinksy as television\u2019s mild-mannered voice of reason, but disguised as the Eagle this Wednesday, he really let his inner rock star take flight. Doing his smarmiest karaoke-crooner renditions of Meat Loaf\u2019s \u201cI Would Do Anything for love (But I Won\u2019t Do That)\u201d and Nancy Sinatra\u2019s \u201cThese Boots Are Made for Walking\u201d in full hippie/biker regalia, Drew was clearly feeling his rock \u2018n\u2019 roll fantasy. Was this Freedom Rock? Well, turn it up, man! And that he did.\n\n\u201cI'm gonna prove I don't just hang out with rock stars. I am one,\u201d this whirly-bird declared as he spread his bespoke wings, referring to the numerous rockers who\u2019ve entered Celebrity Rehab or guested the syndicated radio version of Loveline over the years. Well, the Eagle didn\u2019t quite land all the notes, but his swagger had the judges guessing he was Kid Rock or Bret Michaels (the red bandana threw them off, I guess). I actually thought he sounded a bit like that bonkers new wave album that David Hasselhoff just dropped.\n\nThe judges also thought it the Eagle might be Jimmy Fallon, Jeff Goldblum, Jeff Foxworthy, Craig Ferguson, Jay Mohr, Pauly Shore, or even Howard Stern -- which shows you just how much feather-ruffling attitude Dr. Drew had going on. But no one guessed correctly; the closest the judges got was Adam Carolla, Drew\u2019s former Loveline cohost, even though judge Ken Jeong used to fill in for Drew on Loveline. Now, normally Ken is the worst guesser on the Masked Singer panel anyway, but this character was a true mystery, probably the most surprising reveal of the series yet.\n\nSo, the Eagle had to leave the Masked Singer nest this week, but three other celebrity cosplayers flew to the next round. Let\u2019s try to figure out the identities of this week\u2019s masked menagerie members.\n\nThe Flower, \u201c9 to 5\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't even go to the grocery store without lipstick or pumps on,\u201d bragged this diva \u2013 and honestly, after this episode, she shouldn\u2019t go to the grocery store without this outfit on. I\u2019d never take it off if I ever got a chance to wear it; this exotic purple-rose-of-Cairo costume was like something out of a V.C. Andrews-book-jacket-themed Met Ball.\n\nAnyway, the Flower\u2019s performance was just as stunning. She blossomed onstage and sounded like a legend. The judges shouted, \u201cWe\u2019re not worthy!\u201d while the usually unflappable Nick Cannon seemed awestruck, shaking in his million-dollar shoes. \"I think we're in the presence of greatness,\" Nick proclaimed. As far as clues, the Flower mentioned the word \u201cempire\u201d and said she\u2019s dabbled in \u201ccooking, clothing, and craft.\u201d\n\nJudges\u2019 guesses: Jessie J and Jennifer Hudson (because of the booming voice), Taraji P. Henson, Martha Stewart, Patti LaBelle, and Bjork (come on, going on The Masked Singer would be like a Casual Friday for that swan-lady). A mention of having a \u201cvision of love\u201d had the judges also thinking this might be Nick\u2019s ex, Mariah Carey, and another line, \u201cWhat\u2019s love got to do with it,\u201d brought up Tina Turner and Angela Bassett.\n\nMy guess: The Flower had Mariah\u2019s slow mermaid gait and grand-dame personality, but I think this is Empire regular, baking-empire entrepreneur, and friend of Mariah and Tina, Patti LaBelle. Hey, if Gladys Knight was willing to dress up as the Bee last season, why can\u2019t a soul icon like Patti be a flower?\n\nThe Penguin, \u201cThe Middle\u201d and \u201cWorth It\u201d\n\n\u201cMy whole life, I've been told I'm not pretty enough, not smart enough, not funny enough,\u201d lamented this poor little tuxedo\u2019d creature, who said she\u2019s been told many time her career is \u201cover.\u201d Nope! Sorry, haters \u2013 who, according to the Penguin\u2019s \u201chit list,\u201d include the press, comedy club owners, school bullies, and her exes \u2013 you\u2019ve only really made it until you\u2019ve belted Zedd and Fifth Harmony songs in a penguin costume on national TV. This woman clearly wasn\u2019t a professional singer like the Flower, but she gave a vivacious performance and let her happy feet take her all over the stage.", "description": "This character was a true mystery, probably the most surprising reveal of the series yet.", "authors": ["Lyndsey Parker", "Editor-In-Chief"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/U.GgEWz6Tuk7AWYDqycWZQ--~B/aD05NDc7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/24c93240-eb05-11e9-9fff-7d03ec7c918d", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
