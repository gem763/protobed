And they\u2019ve embraced tax-the-rich proposals that could increase levies on themselves and similarly-situated peers as they look to unseat President Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nUnder Warren\u2019s plan, the Massachusetts senator, who earned $846,000 in 2018, the first year under Trump\u2019s tax cuts, would pay about 15% more.\n\nBiden lived on his public salary until he left the vice president\u2019s office and then joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania and has been on the speaking circuit. He was the highest earner among the candidates in 2018 with income of nearly $4.6 million. Under his plan to raise taxes on top earners, he\u2019d pay about 6% more.\n\nSanders, who earned the least among the group with $519,529 in income, could see his liability climb about 13% from new taxes to fund his government-run health care plan. Harris, who with her husband earned $1.9 million last year, would see her joint tax bill increase 8%.\n\nThe figures are low-end estimates from the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think thank. The foundation\u2019s model about how much the candidates would pay in federal income taxes under their policies is based on their 2018 income. The projections aren\u2019t a complete picture since the candidates haven\u2019t fully fleshed out their tax policy ideas.\n\n\u201cThey are walking the walk in putting out proposals that would indeed tax the wealthy,\u201d said Michael Linden, a fellow at the liberal Roosevelt Institute.\n\nThe calculations didn\u2019t take into account some tax changes the candidates have proposed because they either didn\u2019t apply to them personally or weren\u2019t quantifiable in the model. For example, neither Warren nor Sanders\u2019 have accumulated enough assets to have to pay the wealth taxes they have proposed on households worth more than $32 billion in Sanders\u2019 plan and $50 billion in Warren\u2019s.\n\nTaxes on stock and bond trades also weren\u2019t included \u2013 which Harris, Warren and Sanders have floated \u2013 since those levies depend on the amount an individual buys and sells securities throughout the year, which isn\u2019t reported on a tax return.\n\nDemocratic candidates have focused on taxing the wealthy as a key revenue source to fund such ambitious ideas as universal child care, free college education and government-run health care, which alone would cost around $30 trillion.\n\nThe candidates have proposed offsetting those costs with an expanded estate tax, a wealth tax on assets, a higher tax on capital gains income and increasing income taxes for top earners.\n\nRead More: Sanders, Warren Compete for Who Can Tax Billionaires the Most\n\n\u201cThere is pent-up demand for investing in everything from infrastructure, to free public college education, to addressing climate disruption and helping families address health costs and child care costs,\u201d said Frank Clemente, the executive director for the progressive group Americans for Tax Fairness. \u201cYou cannot do the kinds of things that we need to do in this country unless you\u2019re going to raise the revenue to do that.\u201d\n\nPeople with exceptionally high incomes could see their taxes rise even more than Biden, Warren, Sanders and Harris, because they tend to earn a significant portion of their money from capital gains income, currently taxed at 23.8%, instead of from salaries, currently taxed at a maximum of 37%.\n\nAll the leading candidates have talked about taxing capital gains at the same rates as wage income. That\u2019s not reflected in the tax increase calculations of the candidates because none of them had much capital gains income in 2018.\n\nMost of them got a tax break last year from Trump\u2019s tax overhaul, according to the Tax Foundation\u2019s model. Harris was the only candidate to see her tax liability increase.\n\nHarris was able to deduct only $10,000 of her $225,440 state and local tax bill, because the 2017 law limited write-offs for so-called SALT payments. Democrats have criticized this portion of the law saying it singled out voters in Democratic-led states where taxes tend to be higher.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The leading Democratic presidential candidates are promising to pay for their policy visions with new taxes on the wealthy -- and some of the 2020 contenders would have to pay dearly.The four top-polling candidates \u2013 Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris \u2013 all earned", "authors": ["Laura Davison", "Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UTc9MoDbJ9u2LrtcExLMag--~B/aD05MjQ7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/4e474d7680f407c50e490a984a170a41"}
