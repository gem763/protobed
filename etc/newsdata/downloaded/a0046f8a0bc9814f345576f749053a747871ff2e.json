It was 18%.\n\nGetty Images Apple\u2019s iPhone 11 devices went on sale in late September.\n\nApple Inc. gave an upbeat holiday forecast Wednesday even as the company saw iPhone revenue sink for the fourth quarter in a row.\n\nThe company AAPL, -0.01% handily topped expectations with its fiscal fourth-quarter report, posting revenue of $64 billion, up from $62.9 billion a year earlier, and above the $63 billion that analysts surveyed by FactSet had been forecasting. Net income dropped to $13.7 billion from $14.1 billion, but on a per-share basis, earnings rose to $3.05 from $2.91. Analysts were modeling $2.83 in earnings per share.\n\nFor more coverage of Apple\u2019s earnings and conference call, see our live blog recap\n\nThough management gave some cheery indications about Apple\u2019s iPhone lineup, including that the iPhone 11 has been the best-selling model since its mid-September launch, the real stars of Apple\u2019s quarter were other areas of the business. The company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories unit saw revenue jump 54% to $6.5 billion, while services revenue climbed 18% to $12.5 billion. Both topped the consensus view.\n\nApple disclosed that about three-quarters of Apple Watch purchases during the quarter were to those who had never owned one before, suggesting that there\u2019s still room for Apple to drive further penetration. Management is also optimistic about its new noise-cancelling AirPods, which are expected to mainly appeal to current AirPod owners, at least at first. Apple historically hasn\u2019t broken out the numerical performance of either of these product lines and declined to do so again during Wednesday\u2019s earnings call.\n\nStrength in those areas helped make up for continued declines in the iPhone business. Apple\u2019s numbers for the September quarter contained a few weeks of iPhone 11 sales, as all three of the company\u2019s new devices became available for pre-order on Sept. 13 and officially went on sale Sept. 20. Revenue from iPhones fell to $33.4 billion from $37.2 billion a year before, though the figure came in ahead of the $32.8 billion that analysts were expecting.\n\nOpinion: Two struggling industries could demolish tech\u2019s earnings season\n\nChief Executive Tim Cook told analysts on the earnings call that the company\u2019s pricing moves \u201chave been smart and well-received and do show a level of elasticity,\u201d but that consumers are also attracted to the feature improvements in Apple\u2019s new devices.\n\nThe key metric heading into Apple\u2019s report was its December-quarter outlook, which gives a fuller glimpse into how Apple expects the iPhone 11 family to perform, especially heading into the crucial holiday season. Management gave a revenue forecast of $85.5 billion to $89.5 billion for the fiscal first quarter, whereas analysts were calling for $86.7 billion.\n\nChief Financial Officer Luca Maestri defended Apple\u2019s outlook to an analyst who asked on the call about the magnitude of growth that the forecast implies. Bernstein\u2019s Toni Sacconaghi flagged that the midpoint of Apple\u2019s forecast calls for almost 37% sequential growth, whereas Apple has historically shown revenue increases of 50% or more. But Maestri said that the outlook models an acceleration of growth \u201cfrom the performance that we\u2019ve seen during the course of fiscal 2019\u201d and flagged about $1.1 billion in negative foreign-exchange impacts.\n\nSee also: Facebook shares rise 4% after earnings beat estimates\n\nShares have gained 54% so far this year, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.43%, of which Apple is a component, has climbed 17%.", "description": "Apple Inc. gave an upbeat holiday forecast Wednesday even as the company saw iPhone revenue sink for the fourth quarter in a row.", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR030_iphone_ZG_20190910143453.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
