This places SUVs ahead of trucks and aviation in terms of carbon footprint. The study also found that 100% of the increase in demand for oil for passenger cars was driven by the popularity of larger vehicles.", "description": "According to a new study from the International Energy Agency, SUVs now account for 40% of worldwide car sales, and it's having a big impact on carbon emissions.", "authors": ["Pippa Stevens"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105174459-GettyImages-103157613.jpg?v=1568648995", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
