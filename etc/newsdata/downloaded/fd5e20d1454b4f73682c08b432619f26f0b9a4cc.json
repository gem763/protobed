In addition, the new evidence shows Alani traveled to Iraq in March but did not disclose that to authorities after his arrest.\n\n\u201cYou may be very sympathetic to terrorists,\u201d Judge McAliley told Alani at the hearing. \u201cThat\u2019s very disconcerting.\u201d\n\nAlani is a naturalized U.S. citizen from Iraq who has worked as an airline mechanic for 30 years, with no prior criminal record. He\u2019s not charged with a terror-related crime, but Assistant U.S. Attorney Maria Medetis said the potential links to the Islamic State give rise to the possibility his actions had a darker purpose.\n\nAlani told agents after his arrest earlier this month that, \u201cOut of my evil side, I wanted to do something,\u201d Medetis said, adding that the statement was recorded by the FBI.\n\nAlani is charged with sabotaging a Boeing 737 with 150 passengers and crew aboard at Miami International Airport in July because, he told authorities, ongoing labor negotiations were jeopardizing his chances at earning overtime. The aircraft did not take off and no one was injured. And Alani did work overtime to help fix the plane.\n\nHe faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of the charge of \u201cwillfully damaging, destroying or disabling\u201d an aircraft used in commercial aviation, or trying to do so.\n\nThe sabotage involved gluing a piece of Styrofoam inside the nose of the aircraft that effectively disabled a component pilots depend on to gauge such things as airspeed, the pitch of the plane, and so forth. Authorities say the problem was detected just before takeoff, when an error message appeared on a screen in the cockpit and the jet returned to a gate. It was bound for Nassau, Bahamas.\n\nAirport surveillance video showed Alani working on the aircraft\u2019s nose compartment for seven minutes. He was later identified by co-workers from that video.\n\nAlani attorney Christian Dunham, a federal public defender, said as an experienced mechanic Alani knew the sabotage would keep the aircraft from flying and, even if it did take off, there are redundancies built in that would have kept it safe.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think they are going to be able to prove he intentionally put people in danger,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cThe plane would have been fine to fly.\u201d\n\nDunham asked for Alani\u2019s release on $200,000 bail, secured by family members - many of whom live in the San Francisco area - as well as former co-workers at American Airlines in Miami. Alani has been fired from his job at the airline and the Federal Aviation Administration recently revoked his certificate as an aircraft mechanic, Dunham said.\n\nBut McAliley said she could not grant Alani release on bail because of his ability to travel abroad frequently and because he might still pose a danger to the community. She also noted that Alani admitted his actions to investigators and that the evidence overwhelmingly points to his guilt.\n\n\u201cWhat you did with this aircraft was highly reckless and unconscionable,\u201d the judge said. \u201cCertainly there was a risk of a catastrophic disaster. I think it is likely you will be convicted.\u201d\n\nAlani is expected to enter a plea at another hearing Friday.\n\n___\n\nFollow Curt Anderson on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Miamicurt\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A federal judge cited new evidence of potential terrorism sympathies Wednesday in denying bail for a longtime mechanic charged with sabotaging an American Airlines jetliner that prosecutors say could have caused it to crash with 150 people aboard.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Curt Anderson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/plane_sabotage_95784_c0-134-3931-2425_s1770x1032.jpg?9861819c5719fab7a02a7918a598b6c9486678d2", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
