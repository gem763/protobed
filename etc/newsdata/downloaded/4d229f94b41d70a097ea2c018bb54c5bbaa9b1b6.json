The index climbed just 1% in the third quarter due to the uncertainty generated by the trade war.\n\nIf Kostin's predicted rally materializes, the stocks listed below could be among the biggest beneficiaries on the way up. They are all buy-rated by Goldman. And as of September 30, their prices were furthest from analysts' bullish price targets.\n\nThe list is ranked ranked from stocks with the least to the most upside relative to 12-month price targets.", "description": "More gains are coming to the stock market this year, according to Goldman's analysts \u2014\u00a0and these stocks could be among the biggest gainers.", "authors": ["Akin Oyedele"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9617d6d5985820fd652afd?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
