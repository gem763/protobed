(Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo)\n\nIn person, the difference is obvious. When compared side-by-side with a Samsung Notebook 9 from last year, the Galaxy Book Flex\u2019s display was noticeably brighter and more vibrant. However, I do have to mention that in order to get the Galaxy Book Flex\u2019s full 600 nits of brightness, you have to enable to separate outdoor mode.\n\nSporting a gorgeous blue finish, aluminium chassis, and a 360-degree 2-in-1 hinge, the Galaxy Book Flex is the more premium of the pair. The Galaxy Book Flex comes with a range of 10th-gen Intel Ice Lake processors, up to 16GB of RAM, and 1TB NVMe SSDs.\n\nPhoto: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo\n\nHowever, QLED screens weren\u2019t the only piece of tech Samsung borrow from its other gadget divisions, as the Galaxy Book Flex features a built-in S Pen stylus from Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note line of phones. The Galaxy Book Flex and Ion also come with some more smartphone-centric additions thanks to a dedicated fingerprint sensor for fast and secure biometric logins, and a wireless charging pad located underneath the system\u2019s touchpad.\n\nIt\u2019s sort of weird choice because that means you can\u2019t wirelessly charge a gadget and use the touchpad at the same time, and to even turn on the wireless charger, you need to disable the touchpad using a keyboard shortcut. Samsung says the reason for this is because the Galaxy Book Flex\u2019s metal body blocks wireless charging, which is true, but doesn\u2019t address the issue, especially when it comes to the Galaxy Book Ion which sports a plastic body.\n\nAnnoyingly, because of where the wireless charging coil is located, you can\u2019t charge a phone and use the Galaxy Book Flex or Galaxy Book Ion\u2019s touchpad at the same time.

However, the Galaxy Book Ion also comes with slightly reduced performance thanks to a range of Intel 10th-gen Comet Lake processors instead of Ice Lake-based chips.\n\nThankfully, both the 13-inch and 15-inch versions of both systems come with a healthy selection of ports which includes one Thuderbolt 3 port, two standard USB-A 3.0 ports, a full-size HDMI port, and a microSD card slot.\n\nPhoto: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo The Galaxy Book Ion is even lighter than the Flex thanks to its standard clamshell design and plastic body.
