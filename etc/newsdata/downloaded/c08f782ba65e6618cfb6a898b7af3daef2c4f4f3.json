The complaint alleges that White House officials sought to \u201clock down\u201d all records of Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump offered the help of Attorney General William Barr and Giuliani to investigate the dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter in the country. It also alleges that State Department officials were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about Giuliani\u2019s subsequent conversations with Ukrainian leaders.\n\nEven among the president\u2019s closest allies, Giuliani is now the subject of scorn. When I reached him by phone this morning, following House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s release of the full whistle-blower complaint at the center of the Ukraine scandal, he was, put simply, very angry.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible that the whistle-blower is a hero and I\u2019m not. And I will be the hero! These morons\u2014when this is over, I will be the hero,\u201d Giuliani told me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not acting as a lawyer. I\u2019m acting as someone who has devoted most of his life to straightening out government,\u201d he continued, sounding out of breath. \u201cAnything I did should be praised.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Elaina Plott", "Theatlantic.Com Politics Archive Giuliani-Ukraine-Trump-Biden"], "top_image": ""}
