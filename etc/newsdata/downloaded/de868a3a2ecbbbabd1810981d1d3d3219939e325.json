More of it than they want, even,\u201d Mr. Trump said during remarks at the White House on Sunday morning. \u201cAnd they brought it with them, with lab technicians that were with them. They assumed this was Baghdadi. They thought visually it was him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey did an on-site test,\u201d the president continued. \u201cThey got samples. And to get to his body, they had to remove a lot of debris because the tunnel had collapsed, but these people are very good at that. And as I said, they brought body parts back \u2026 There wasn\u2019t much left. The vest blew up but there were still substantial pieces they brought back.\u201d\n\nAl-Baghdadi, the longtime leader of the Islamic State who oversaw the group\u2019s rise into a major force in the Middle East, died during a U.S. raid on his compound in northwestern Syria on Saturday, the president said. He fled into a tunnel to escape American forces before detonating a suicide vest and killing himself.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
