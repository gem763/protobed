The service we got from Prof Beale was excellent and his communication was second to none.\n\nIt is therefore a surprise to me to see only negative reports about him in the media. I am also sorry for the parents that might have lost their kids after some medical procedures with the Prof. However, I believe proper investigations are always required to understand the causes such unfortunate incidents before blaming the Prof.\n\nIt is also important to seek balanced reporting on such matters. Negative media reports have a negative impact on someone's profession, even if the victim of the negative reporting is exonerated at a later date.\n\n\n\n", "description": "The current reports on the alleged poor conduct of Professor Peter Beale have left me in disbelief and with a lot of questions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3791/6b77e14137144b7e98d10fcad63e93e2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
