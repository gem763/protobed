The forces backing impeachment, meanwhile, are telling us those same defendants are obstructing a lawful impeachment inquiry.\n\nThis latest incident, set against the impeachment mania and the reportedly \u201cexpanding\u201d Russiagate investigation of U.S. Attorney John Durham, accelerates our timeline to chaos. We are speeding toward a situation when someone in one of these camps refuses to obey a major decree, arrest order, or court decision, at which point Americans will get to experience the joys of their political futures being decided by phone calls to generals and police chiefs.\n\nMy discomfort in the last few years, first with Russiagate and now with Ukrainegate and impeachment, stems from the belief that the people pushing hardest for Trump\u2019s early removal are more dangerous than Trump. Many Americans don\u2019t see this because they\u2019re not used to waking up in a country where you\u2019re not sure who the president will be by nightfall. They don\u2019t understand that this predicament is worse than having a bad president.", "description": "", "authors": ["Matt Taibbi", "Taibbi.Substack.Com P Were-In-A-Permanent-Coup"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
