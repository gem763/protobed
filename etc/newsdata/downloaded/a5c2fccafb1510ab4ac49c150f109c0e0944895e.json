Verizon and T-Mobile both said on Twitter that the phone was not supported, as spotted by 9to5Google, and AT&T has yet to say whether it\u2019ll be supported. Only Sprint has said, in an email to The Verge, that it will support RCS, which adds features like read receipts, typing indicators, and higher-quality attachments to the standard Android Messages app.\n\nThe rollout of RCS messaging has been a complete mess. The standard, which is supposed to replace the basic SMS and MMS messaging that\u2019s been around for as long as we\u2019ve used smartphones, has been slated to roll out for years now. Its biggest push came in 2018, when Google settled on RCS as the solution for upgrading messaging on Android. But more than a year later, there\u2019s been very little movement. Google said it would start forcing the change on its carrier partners earlier this year, but that hasn\u2019t happened in the US.\n\nVerizon even supported RCS on the Pixel 3, but not here\n\nSo with the Pixel 4 about to launch, Google finds its flagship phone missing a feature on many networks that was supposed to be widely deployed by now \u2014 and that was even present for some users of its last device.\n\nOn Verizon, RCS support was added to the Pixel 3 a couple months after launch. Verizon didn\u2019t support RCS until December of last year, and the Pixel 3 was its inaugural device. The Galaxy S9 later got support, too (though only when messaging within Verizon\u2019s network), but it\u2019s not clear that other phones have been added since.\n\nThe Pixel 3 didn\u2019t support RCS on most other major networks, but that was understandable: the first three Pixel phones were a Verizon exclusive. Now that the Pixel 4 is available across all the major US carriers, though, it should be expected that RCS support \u2014 something Google has been emphasizing \u2014 would be available on its flagship smartphone. Support could be added later if the carriers choose to, but so far, Sprint is the only major name in the US that\u2019s committed to it.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Google for more information.\n\nCorrection October 18th, 9:00PM ET: This story initially said that the Pixel 3\u2019s RCS support was limited to Verizon, but that was incorrect. Some carriers \u2014 such as Sprint and Google Fi \u2014 have implemented network-wide universal RCS support. That means earlier Pixels would have be able to use RCS when connected to those networks.\n\nThe broader problem here is that the US\u2019s three biggest carriers \u2014 Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile \u2014 don\u2019t yet have network-wide support, which is really the ideal situation so that we\u2019re not asking this question of RCS support phone by phone. For now, Verizon and T-Mobile have been (very occasionally) adding support for devices one by one, such as Verizon did with the Pixel 3.", "description": "Verizon and T-Mobile both said that Google\u2019s Pixel 4 will not support RCS messaging at launch, and AT&T has yet to say whether it\u2019ll be supported.
