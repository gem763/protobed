The process is set to begin later Monday.\n\n\u201cA dedicated support service is being provided by the Civil Aviation Authority to assist customers currently overseas and those in the U.K. with future bookings,\u201d Thomas Cook said on its website. The CAA said it has secured a fleet of aircraft from around the world for the repatriation job, and created a website for Thomas Cook customers seeking information.\n\nThomas Cook has been under pressure from lenders to find an additional \u00a3200 million ($249.5 million) to prevent the collapse of a rescue deal under which Chinese conglomerate Fosun International Ltd. 656 -0.96% was to inject significant funds.\n\n\u201cWe have worked exhaustively in the past few days to resolve the outstanding issues on an agreement to secure Thomas Cook\u2019s future for its employees, customers and suppliers,\u201d Chief Executive Peter Fankhauser said. \u201cAlthough a deal had been largely agreed, an additional facility requested in the last few days of negotiations presented a challenge that ultimately proved insurmountable.\u201d\n\nThe company, which dates back to 1841, has struggled with a decline in tour and flight bookings, higher fuel prices and uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s planned departure from the European Union.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the trends experienced in the first half of the year have continued into the second half, reflecting an uncertain consumer environment, particularly in the U.K., leading to intense competition,\u201d the company said in July.\n\nWrite to P.R.
