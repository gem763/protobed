I hope your week\u2019s been amazing and wishing you a great weekend.\n\n\u201cI appreciate all the positive vibes you\u2019ve sent my way. I haven\u2019t given up, I\u2019m still right here fighting!\u201d.\n\nThe Briton raised eyebrows on Tuesday when he started an Instagram story, which disappeared after 24 hours, with some cryptic comments.\n\n\u201cWhy bother when the world is such a mess and people don\u2019t seem to care,\u201d the 34-year-old said then.\n\nHe later made clear he was talking about the environment and wanted people to follow a plant-based vegan diet, as he has done.\n\nThat post, soon removed, drew supportive comments from concerned fans as well as criticism from those pointing out his global footprint as a racing driver flying around the world for a car manufacturer sponsored by an oil giant.\n\nDamon Hill, the 1996 world champion, sounded a supportive tone on Twitter, while appreciating that Hamilton would get \u201cno end of flak.\n\n\u201cWe are all hypocritical to greater or lesser degrees,\u201d he added. \u201cBut if people like him don\u2019t speak out then we all carry on in the same vein and don\u2019t even try to change. It\u2019s not that bad, eating carrots.\u201d\n\nHamilton, who sold his private jet earlier in the year but still has a collection of supercars, is no stranger to stirring up social media.\n\nIn 2017 he deleted all his instagram posts and apologised after posting a video in which he jokingly chastised his nephew for wearing a princess dress on Christmas Day, saying \u2018boys don\u2019t wear princess dresses.\u2019\n\nHe recently deleted all the accounts he follows on Instagram, saying he \u201cwanted kind of a fresh slate.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Formula One F1 - Japanese Grand Prix - Suzuka Circuit, Suzuka, Japan - October 13, 2019.

You\u2019re always catching up and I just decided to change,\u201d he said then.\n\n\u201cI wake up now and I have a bit of a read, I start my day differently and I\u2019m hardly ever on it and this has made a big difference to my life, personally.\u201d\n\nAt McLaren in 2012 Hamilton tweeted confidential team telemetry, and in 2016 he kicked up another storm by playing around with Snapchat during an official news conference and then taking issue with the media.", "description": "Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton sent his fans a burst of positive energy on Friday after he started the week by saying he felt like \"giving up on everything\" because the world was in such a mess.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442345141&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H1MC", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
