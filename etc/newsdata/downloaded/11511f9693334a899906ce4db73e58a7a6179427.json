She said that's about 30% of Salem's total annual tourists.\n\nWalk the streets of Salem, Mass. (Photo: Morgan Hines / USA TODAY)\n\nBy Oct. 1, the town was fully decked: skeletons in windows, pumpkins everywhere, brooms attached to the backs of bicycles and a zombie playing saxophone for tips on the cobblestones.\n\nA major reason Salem is considered a destination for Halloween lovers is also a dark part of its history: the Salem witch trials.\n\nThe Salem witch trials\n\nIn 1692, in Colonial America's Salem Village, a group of young girls started having \"fits and convulsions.\" Authorities declared it the work of the devil and determined the girls must have been bewitched.\n\nMass hysteria spread throughout the area.\n\nAbout 150 people in Salem and surrounding towns were accused of witchcraft and thrown into jail.\n\nAfter their trials, 20 people were executed in Salem for witchcraft. Nineteen were hanged and one was pressed to death, Jill Christiansen, assistant director of education at the Salem Witch Museum, told me.\n\nStops to make\n\nI started with a zine from NowAge Travel titled \"Walking the Witch Trials: A DIY Tour of Salem History.\"\n\nFrom the guide, I selected a few key stops, including the Witch House and Salem Witch Museum.\n\nThe Witch House: The Witch House is the only building still standing in Salem that has a direct connection to the witch trials. One of the men who served as a judge in the trials, Jonathan Corwin, occupied the house at the time of the trials.\n\nGuests to the Witch House can take a guided or individual tour. Ticket costs vary: $8.25 for adults, $6.25 for seniors and veterans and $4.25 for children. A guided tour costs an additional $2.\n\nI took my own, and it was fairly quick. Visitors can get a glimpse into the lives of people from the era and learn more about the witch trials. I spent about a half-hour reading about the witch trials and perused rooms filled with artifacts of daily life in the late 17th century. The rooms were filled with furnishings, documents, tools, cookware and medicinal objects.\n\nIn Salem's high traffic season, Judy Marshall, a tour guide at the Witch House said the house gets thousands of visitors daily \u2013 the line goes around the block, and it's a two-hour wait to get in, particularly on the weekends.\n\nExplore the Witch House in Salem.

Daily, the museum runs tours every half-hour. Tickets are $13 for adults, $11.50 for seniors and $10 for children.\n\nFirst, guests sit for a stage-set presentation about what happened during the witch trials. Then, Christiansen or another team member leads guests into a room featuring depictions of witches over the centuries, starting with a midwife from pre-Christian Europe to the stereotypical witch we think of today \u2013 with a pointy black hat \u2013 to Wiccans.\n\nIn 2022, Christiansen said, when the museum celebrates its 50th anniversary, the presentation will be updated to reflect evolution in research around the witch trials.\n\nThe Salem Witch Museum displays witch depictions over the centuries.

And it's individualized. Every witch can define for herself what being a witch means, Nierman and her wife, Erica Feldmann, owner of HausWitch: Home + Healing, explained.\n\n\"It's more about feeling empowered, wanting to change the world and connecting to your own intuition,\" Feldmann said.\n\nThere aren't prescribed practices; anyone who wants to hold the title of \"witch,\" can, Feldmann said.\n\n\"If you talk to five different witches, they\u2019re all going to tell you different things,\" Nierman said. \"It's all very personal.\"\n\nIn Salem, there are plenty of shops for witches and tourists alike, each offering its own vibe, Nierman and Feldmann told me. At HausWitch, you can find locally made goods, tarot cards, artwork, crystals, books and more.\n\nThe modern witch may feel at home in HausWitch: Home + Healing.

It goes beyond witches: There are ghost tours, the New England Pirate Museum, a wax museum and more.\n\nI couldn't even make it through my witchy to-do list when I went, which is the perfect excuse to visit again soon.\n\nFollow Morgan Hines on Twitter: @MorganEmHines.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2019/10/07/salem-witch-trials-halloween-perfect-time-visit-witch-city/3839745002/", "description": "Salem, Massachusetts, has a fifth season in its calendar year: Halloween.
