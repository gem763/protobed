The blood of the city\u2019s history soaked into the clay. Quiet hidden corners, conspiratorial whispers in coffee houses, the dirty Thames and the Great Stink. Invasions, bridges, fires and fog. It\u2019s a very human tale told with the verve of a novelist, the detail of a diarist and the grace of a poet.\u201d \u2013 dylan37\n\n\u201cThe one novel I\u2019ve read from the century to date that I am sure will stay with me for the rest of my life, for personal as well as for general reasons, is The Hunger Angel by Herta M\u00fcller (translated by Philip Boehm in 2012). It was published in German as Atemschaukel in 2009, just before she (deservedly) won the Nobel prize for literature. It\u2019s an extraordinarily dense and poetic work and one that seems to transcend language \u2013 so perfectly written that text and idea are fused, yet still overflowing with humanity.\u201d \u2013 nilpferd\n\n\u201cI also rate The City and the City very highly but Perdido Street Station by China Mi\u00e9ville (2000) is the one I\u2019ve reread a couple of times since I first came across it. The world he builds is convincing and immersive, whereas in some of his later work it can feel like the ideas he wants to explore take primacy over character development, plot and setting.\u201d \u2013 Vonnegut\n\n\u201cThe People\u2019s Act of Love by James Meek (2005) is like a classic Russian masterpiece, written by a British author, dark and a bit twisted.\u201d \u2013 BParker\n\n\u201cVery surprised not to see any of Amitav Ghosh\u2019s Ibis Trilogy (2008-2015). Historical writing very much for our time, set in the 1830s when drugs, capital, indentured labour and languages themselves were moving across the seas between Britain, India and China. Ghosh juggles the fates of multiple and memorable British, Indian and Chinese characters with some glorious writing, especially about ships and the sea.\u201d \u2013 bertilek\n\n\u201cWe Need to Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriver (2003) is one of the most disturbing, unstoppable and unforgettable books I\u2019ve ever read. Incredibly well written and a sucker punch twist at the end.\u201d \u2013 MajorJackCelliers\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Matt Haig. Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer\n\n\u201cWas waiting and waiting for Reasons to Stay Alive by Matt Haig (2015) to appear. Very intelligently written, beautiful, heartbreaking and life-affirming and SO important \u2013 it has saved countless lives. Can\u2019t imagine a more important book.\u201d \u2013 gadget\n\n\u201cEast West Street by Phillippe Sands (2016) is a work of startling humanity, timely importance, magisterial prose and emotional depth. Not many laughs, I grant you, but on any measure it beats most of the non-fiction on this list into a cocked hat.\u201d \u2013 MartyPines\n\n\u201cConvenience Store Woman by Sakata Murata (2016, translated by Ginny Tapley Takemori in 2018) and Quiet by Susan Cain (2012). Convenience Store Woman was short but brilliant, with incisive observations about Japanese society, convenience store \u2018culture\u2019 and how \u2018outsiders\u2019 and those with mental health conditions are often maligned and misunderstood by society. Quiet was a fascinating read with eye-opening revelations on how soft-spoken and shy individuals often don\u2019t receive the credit they deserve.\u201d \u2013 piggywigee\n\n\u201cThe Black Swan by Nassim Nicholas Taleb (2007) was the first time I had seen a clear explanation of the two types of statistics that explain clearly \u201cnormal\u201d events and statistically \u201cfractal\u201d ones such as stock-market crashes and delayed projects. It also made me realise how poorly educated we are.\u201d \u2013 Maclon\n\n\u201cThe Rest Is Noise by Alex Ross (2007), his superb survey of 20th -century music, which makes you want to listen immediately to each and every piece he discusses; Anathem by Neal Stephenson (2008), which takes you from monkish cloisters to the stars in bravura style; Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts by Christopher de Hamel (2016), which gives the most illuminating insight into \u2026 illuminated manuscripts (something you never thought you\u2019d find interesting, but read this and you will!); and The Algebraist by Iain Banks (2004). (There has to be something by Banksie in any list of this sort \u2013 perhaps you\u2019d prefer Transition, but anyway, he knocks spots off yer McEwans, Rowlings and Amises.)\u201c \u2013 Dogbertd\n\n\u201cStephen Baxter\u2019s Space (2000). The hardest of hard science fiction authors (save for perhaps Kim Stanley Robinson), and also the one with the most \u201cout there\u201d ideas. Never more epic than the climax of Space. The book is an incredible answer to Fermi\u2019s Paradox \u2026 you\u2019ll remember Space forever. It answers everything.\u201d \u2013 dholliday\n\n'People hope my book will be China's Star Wars': Liu Cixin on China's exploding sci-fi scene Read more\n\n\u201cI\u2019d just add a shout out for Liu Cixin\u2019s Three Body Problem (2008, translated by Ken Liu in 2014). A really different hard science fiction take on \u201care we alone in the universe and why has no one contacted us yet\u201d, made more intriguing by the fact it was originally written in Chinese and therefore has totally different cultural assumptions to our usual western sci-fi.\u201d \u2013 yazbod\n\n\u201cAdrian Desmond and James Moore\u2019s Darwin\u2019s Sacred Cause (2009) is the companion and follow-up to these authors\u2019 1991 biography of Darwin. Once read, all of the attacks on Darwin can be dismissed as you will know far more than any antagonist. But more than dates or facts, you will have the most intimate portrait, fully fleshed out, which really gives an insight into this Victorian gentleman. If you don\u2019t love him after this account, you have a heart of stone.\u201d \u2013 jonniestewpot\n\n\u201cLawrence Wright\u2019s The Looming Tower (2006) is a fascinating and exhaustive account of the background and build-up to the 9/11 attacks, including a fairly comprehensive history of modern Islamic radicalism (or ultra-extreme conservatism, if you prefer) going back to Sayyid Qutb.\u201d \u2013 TempestTargetTug", "description": "After we published our list of the greatest books since 2000, you sent in your own suggestions \u2013 from Chinese sci-fi to a history of music", "authors": ["Guardian Readers"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e01b4e76924239fa180e4667c859bff0ebd00a2d/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b7f66ade7b81d6ffb7d073352e1171c5", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
