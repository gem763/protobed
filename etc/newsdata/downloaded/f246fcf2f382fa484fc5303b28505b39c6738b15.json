But that doesn\u2019t mean he can poo-poo popular films he doesn\u2019t deem worthy enough to share the limelight with his own wonders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArt is subjective, right? Well this is me telling you many deem Marvel to definitely be \u2018cinema\u2019.\n\nOver the weekend Scorsese admitted he\u2019d tried and failed to enjoy the Marvel movies, which include money-spinners like Infinity War, Endgame, Guardians Of The Galaxy and Captain America.\n\nAccording to the director, the genre simply didn\u2019t chime with his own cinematic tastes. Which is fine, sure, but he\u2019s enraged a whole franchise of fans in the process\u2026\n\nHe shared to Empire magazine: \u2018I don\u2019t see them. I tried, you know? But that\u2019s not cinema.\n\nThese are creators of some of the best cinema, IMO (Picture: FilmMagic)\n\n\u2018Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks.\n\n\u2018It isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\u2019\n\nOuch?\n\nThe man is allowed to have his own opinion, but it\u2019s a little rich also admitting he doesn\u2019t even watch the things he\u2019s passing harsh judgement on.\n\nIf Scorsese had managed to sit through Endgame (alright, it was three hours, that movie was tricky for all of us) he\u2019d have realised the whole thing was jam-packed full of human emotion.\n\nYou try not bawling your eyes out as Robert Downey Jr\u2019s Iron Man takes his final bow, I dare you, Marty.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nWe might all be angry at something, always enraged, we are, but you can\u2019t deny Marvel is well and truly what cinema in the modern age is about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe buzz about Endgame was ferocious (for the sake of the word count, I\u2019m going to focus on Endgame, rather than dragging in the other 22 released movies of the MCU) from the get go. Ever since Infinity War wrapped on that epic cliffhanger in 2018 we were enraptured with what would come next, with each theory that emerged piquing our interest further.\n\nIt comes as no great shock the vast amount of eyeballs in the cinema in April when Endgame debuted thrust the film to the top of the list, making it the highest grossing-film of all time.\n\nBox office takings shouldn\u2019t decide what \u2018cinema\u2019 is, but the fact Martin\u2019s highest-grossing film, 2013\u2019s The Wolf Of Wall Street, made $392million (\u00a3317million) compared to Endgame\u2019s $2.7billion (\u00a32.2billion) should show you the punters just aren\u2019t after the same thing these days.\n\nYou try not to feel intense human emotion (Picture: Marvel Studios)\n\nMore than that, but it\u2019s being nominated for the very awards that everyone seems to hold up as the deciding voice on what \u2018cinema\u2019 is. Earlier this year Black Panther became the first Marvel film to be nominated for best picture at the Oscars. It was also Marvel\u2019s first film to win an Oscar with its awards for best original score, best costume design and best production design.\n\nKanye West might say Martin Scorsese made some of the best films OF ALL TIME but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re any more \u2018cinema\u2019 than Endgame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the interest of trying to see all sides of the cinema amid my rage, you could argue the churning behemoth that is the MCU is eating up any chance for smaller films to make a dent in the box office; their chance to tell these \u2018human emotional and psychological stories\u2019 all but thwarted by that fiendish, plotting Kevin Feige and his army of evil Marvel films.\n\nBut, real talk, Martin is diminishing Marvel\u2019s success in humanising characters and bring psychological experiences to another human being.\n\nWe\u2019re all be moved by what we\u2019re moved by. Plain and simple. I think Confucius said that.\n\nTo many it sucks that no longer does the old school model of smaller films moving people more so than a churn and burn superhero tale based off a comic book.\n\nBut we\u2019re not that kind of society anymore. Do we not want to encourage younger audiences to enjoy the cinema experience?\n\nSo, sorry Martin, but it\u2019s foolish and reeks of snobbery to judge such a sample of dedicated moviegoers, minimising their artistic preference \u2013 just because you don\u2019t \u2018get\u2019 it.\n\nMORE: Forget the violence, we need to talk about Joker\u2019s raw and necessary view of mental illness\n\nMORE: From promoting indie music to making geekdom cool, The OC had more impact than any other teen series\n\nMORE: Kat McNamara\u2019s female-centric Arrow spin-off proves DC Comics is one of the most inclusive places on TV", "description": "Marvel is what's keeping people in the cinema amid Martin Scorsese's comments on franchise.", "authors": ["Mel Evans"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88684468_1570377164.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
