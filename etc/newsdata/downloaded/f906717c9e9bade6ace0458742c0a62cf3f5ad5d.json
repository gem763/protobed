Harry & Meghan 26th September 2019.\u201d\n\nThe tribute was written by Meghan in the local language Xhosa.\n\nIt was discovered this weekend that the ribbon had been untied and taken, presumably as a macabre souvenir.\n\nUyineye\u2019s mother Noma told the Weekend Argus: \u201cThe disappearance of the ribbon is quite unfortunate and is actually a reflection of the type of society we have become\u201d.\n\n(Image: Doug Peters/EMPICS Entertainment)\n\nIn the wake of the horrific murder demonstrators across the country hit the streets in opposition to the use of violence against women.\n\nSchoolgirl Aaliah Jacobs, 17, who spotted Meghan tying the ribbon, added: \u201cI am highly disappointed that someone took it.\n\n\u201cBut at least Meghan got the word out all over the world about Uyinene and gender-based violence\u201d.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nA 42-year-old man who cannot be named yet appeared before Wynberg Magistrates in Cape Town charged with rape, murder and defeating the ends of justice.\n\nHe is an employee at the Clareinch Post Office in Claremont, Cape Town, where the student was last seen alive on August 24.\n\nHer body was found dumped 15 miles away a week later.", "description": "The Duchess of Sussex had left the tribute for murdered University of Cape Town student Uyinene Mrwetyana", "authors": ["Jamie Pyatt", "Milo Boyd", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Instagram", "Doug Peters Empics Entertainment", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20525892.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SAFRICA-BRITAIN-ROYALS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
