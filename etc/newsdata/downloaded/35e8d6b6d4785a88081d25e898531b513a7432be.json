(AP) - There\u2019s one thing you can say about Gardner Minshew: He never gives up.\n\nDespite a 34-27 loss to the Carolina Panthers , the Jacksonville Jaguars rookie quarterback turned in another encouraging performance, completing 26 of 45 passes for 374 yards with two touchdowns . The Jaguars offense racked up 507 yards against the league\u2019s fourth-ranked defense, which caught the attention of Panthers coach Ron Rivera.\n\n\u201cThey have a young dynamic quarterback,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a special one in this league I think.\u201d\n\nThe Jaguars never led, but they were never out of the game either in large part due to Minshew\u2019s resilience.\n\nHe seemingly had an answer for everything the Panthers threw at him, finding ways to keep plays alive with his feet while playing with the poise of a veteran quarterback and a never-say-die mentality.\n\n\u201cYou feel like you always have a chance when he\u2019s in there,\u201d said Jaguars coach Doug Marrone. \u201cYou feel like he\u2019s going to make a play. I think sometimes you see him running around and moving around and ducking and going and eventually, that stuff - in this league - is going to catch up to you where they\u2019re going to knock the ball out. Sometimes you\u2019re going to make plays, sometimes you\u2019re not. We just appreciate that the guy is out there giving us everything he has.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean the sixth-round pick isn\u2019t going to make rookie mistakes.\n\nHe made several on Sunday.\n\nHe fumbled three times, twice on sacks and had one returned 56 yards for a touchdown by Brian Burns. But even that wasn\u2019t completely his fault as Panthers defensive end Mario Addison pushed blocker Andrew Norwell into Minshew, causing the ball to come out.\n\nBurns later ran down Minshew from behind late in the fourth quarter, recording a sack and fumble. The other fumble came on a miscommunication on a handoff early in the game.\n\n\u201cThose are all on me, that can\u2019t happen,\u201d Minshew said. \u201cWhen stuff like that happens, sometimes you don\u2019t give yourself a chance to win. That\u2019s what I feel like we did, what I did.\u201d\n\nStill, Minshew didn\u2019t give up.\n\nDown 34-27 with 1:45 left and with only one timeout, he led the Jaguars from their 5 to the Carolina 24 battling plenty of crowd noise and a stiff pass rush. But Minshew calmly converted five first downs, including a 26-yard strike over the middle to DJ Chark on third-and-10. But he eventually ran out of time when his pass toward the end zone was knocked down by Luke Kuechly on the game\u2019s final play.\n\n\u201cKnowing the guys in that huddle, as long as there is time on the clock, we are going to keep fighting,\u201d Minshew said. \u201cWe are going to give all we got, because we know the guy next to us is, and you\u2019re not going to let him down. As long as there is any chance, that is what we are going to do.\u201d\n\nMinshew is the first player in NFL history to throw for at least 200 yards passing with a passer rating of at least 95 in each of his first five career games.\n\nChark, who had eight catches for 164 yards and two scores , said he believes better things are ahead for the Jaguars (2-3), who remain in contention in the unpredictable AFC South.\n\n\u201cI feel like once we get our stride going and we\u2019re feeling it, nobody is going to stop us,\u201d Chark said. \u201cWe got down pretty early and there are some things that the offense has to work on but there\u2019s never been a point this season - and we lost two games - there\u2019s never been a point in any of those games where anyone has given up and that\u2019s huge.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There's one thing you can say about Gardner Minshew: He never gives up.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Reed"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/jaguars_panthers_football_37018_c0-207-4952-3094_s1770x1032.jpg?35a2a25a7696a4c0352eccbbc4d3fd27261abcf3", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
