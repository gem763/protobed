It stopped being fun, it was hurting.\"\n\nJames had to have an awkward conversation with his boss at Barking and Dagenham Council.\n\nHe had one operation to drain the blood from his manhood at University College Hospital, London, but that didn't work.\n\nThen the day before his birthday in November 2017, his stubborn penis refused to go down.\n\n(Image: Triangle News)\n\n\"I called the NHS helpline, as time was ticking on,\" James, of Canning Town, east London, recalled.\n\n\"They said go and get in a freezing cold bath, or run up and down some steps, to get some blood into your thighs and calves.\n\n\"I took aspirin and Ibuprofen to thin my blood but nothing worked.\n\n\"I'm at a stage where I can't even walk, so I have to call an ambulance.\"\n\nJames got taken to two separate hospitals, before being rushed to the specialist unit at UCH.\n\nBy that point he had had an erection for 56 hours.\n\n(Image: Joe Newman/Triangle News)\n\n\"I was angry, I was upset, I was scared,\" James said.\n\nJames said it was the most painful experience of his life.\n\n\"I cannot explain the pain of it, it was like it was going to explode,\" he said.\n\nAfter a seven-and-a-half hour surgery doctors managed to deflate James' erection.\n\nBut they told him he needed a permanent operation.\n\n\"I had so many questions,\" James said.\n\n\"Can I still sleep with women? Can I still have kids? Can I still go to the toilet.\n\n\"God blessed me quite well, what is going to happen?\"\n\nThen a week before the operation, in April 2018, his long term girlfriend left him.\n\n\"Talk about a double kick in the nuts,\" James said.\n\n(Image: Triangle News)\n\n\"We had been together for five years, we were willing to go forward, we were going to get engaged.\n\n\"I'm glad it happened really because it showed what sort of person she was.\n\n\"When the tough got going, she got going. She was the only person I had spoken to, so come to the day of the operation I've got no one.\n\n\"I was too embarrassed to tell my family and friends.\n\n\"I had to face it on my own. I came out of the operation not knowing if it was successful, it was a really stressful time.\"\n\nFortunately for James the operation was a success.\n\n\"I'm over the moon with it,\" he said. \"It has humbled me a lot.\"\n\n(Image: Joe Newman/Triangle News)\n\nFor six weeks he couldn't touch his todger, James says.\n\n\"I was walking like John Wayne. I was terrified it wasn't going to be alright. But it's healed and looks completely natural.\"\n\nHe says doctors told him he was a unique case, telling him he was lucky not to have lost his penis and ended up with a prosthesis.\n\nJames can still go to the toilet and he is able to have more kids if he wishes.\n\nHe revealed girls even ask to pump up his new member.\n\nJames labelled his revamped manhood: a \"blessing in disguise.\"\n\n\"It is absolutely brilliant. It's up to you when you want to stop.\"", "description": "James Mudd, from east London, claims he can now have sex all night after an operation to fix his embarrassing problem", "authors": ["Ralph Blackburn", "Image", "Triangle News", "Joe Newman Triangle News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20542528.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Erection_Jimmy_Mudd_21_TRIANGLENEWSJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
