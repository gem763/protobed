The path is secluded and also crosses over a busy road. I think it is dangerous to ask a child to walk that far by themselves.\"\n\nKiri is worried that something could happen to her son, especially since the death of a teenager in the area this summer.\n\nShe believes that the decision to grant children a free bus pass should not just be based on the distance, but also the age of a child.\n\n(Image: Wales Online WS)\n\nA spokeswoman for Rhondda Cynon Taf said: \"Free school transport is given to pupils living more than two miles from their nearest or catchment school a generous provision in comparison to Welsh Government's statutory provision for this age group, which stands at three miles.\n\n\"The council uses consistent criteria to determine eligibility, measured by the shortest safe walking distance - while additional factors are also considered such as whether it is safe for the pupil to walk along or accompanied by an appropriate adult.\n\n\"The pupil from Abernant has been assessed as living 1.972 miles from the catchment faith school and is therefore not eligible for school transport.\n\n\"The walking route from Abernant to St John Baptist Church in Wales High School is long established and in daily use, in accordance with the Learler Travel (Wales) Measure 2008.\n\n\"Inevitably, there are some pupils who fall just outside the two-mile entitlement limit, but the council must be consistent in its provision for all pupils.\n\n\"The council calculates route measurements using Government-standard Ordnance Survey data, accurate to 1m and generally accepted as the most accurate available.\n\n\"The use of alternative methods of measurement for different children from various addresses would not be appropriate, as it would be less accurate and create inequality between families.\n\n\u201cParents are offered the possibility of purchasing spare seats on our school transport, but it is a discretionary provision subject to seat availability.\u201d", "description": "Hudson Griffiths' mum is terrified something might happen to him as he makes the two-mile walk back from school in the winter", "authors": ["Lydia Stephens", "Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Wales Online Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20645182.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Hudson-Griffiths.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
