Michelle Lujan Grisham says her state will set its own fuel economy and pollution standards for vehicles in a break with federal authorities.\n\nLujan Grisham announced Tuesday while in New York for a climate-panel discussion that New Mexico will implement new restrictions on vehicle emissions starting with model-year 2022 autos.\n\nThe first-year Democratic governor criticized a rollback of federal fuel economy standards from the Trump administration as counterproductive. She says New Mexico fuel-economy standards will increase to an average of 52 mpg.\n\nThe Trump administration last week revoked California\u2019s authority to set its own, tougher emission standards under a waiver from the federal Clean Air Act.\n\nLujan Grisham\u2019s clean-car plan would bring New Mexico into alignment with at least 13 other states that have adopted independent standards.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "New Mexico Gov.
