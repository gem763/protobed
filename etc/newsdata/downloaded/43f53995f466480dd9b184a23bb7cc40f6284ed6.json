Katie Hill vows to battle revenge porn, which critics blame for her downfall", "language": "en", "text": "The California Democrat\u2019s announcement Sunday that she would resign comes after the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation of allegations that she was romantically involved with her legislative director \u2014 a relationship that would violate House ethics rules and that Hill denied. Hill was also accused of having a three-person sexual relationship with a female campaign staff member and her now-estranged husband, which she admitted was improper.\n\nBut the allegations came to light only after a conservative news site and a British tabloid published nude images of Hill without her consent \u2014 circumstances that have led many critics to note that Hill is accused of sexual impropriety and is a victim of sexual exploitation.\n\nHill has acknowledged both aspects of her case, previously saying she knew \u201ceven a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate,\u201d while vowing Sunday to mount a legal fight regarding the leak of intimate photos. She has accused her \u201cabusive husband,\u201d with whom she is undergoing a contentious divorce, of engaging in a \u201csmear campaign built around cyber exploitation,\u201d saying he enlisted \u201chateful political operatives\u201d to help. The nude photos were published by the conservative site RedState.org and the Daily Mail.\n\n\u201cHaving private photos of personal moments weaponized against me has been an appalling invasion of my privacy,\u201d she said Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s also illegal, and we are currently pursuing all of our available legal options.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) supported Hill\u2019s resignation Sunday, saying that Hill has \u201cacknowledged errors in judgment that made her continued service as a Member untenable.\u201d\n\nBut fewer lawmakers have outwardly addressed the problem of revenge porn, or nonconsensual pornography. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) was a notable exception. Last week, Gaetz called the House ethics investigation \u201cabsurd,\u201d questioning, \u201cWho among us would look perfect if every ex leaked every photo/text?\u201d He suggested that the real reason Hill was being investigated \u201cis because she is different.\u201d Hill is also one of the first openly bisexual members of Congress.\n\nThis is just absurd. The only person who seems to have a gripe is @RepKatieHill\u2019s soon-to-be ex.\n\n\n\nWho among us would look perfect if every ex leaked every photo/text?\n\n\n\nKatie isn\u2019t being investigated by Ethics or maligned because she hurt anyone - it is because she is different. https://t.co/Czrc2k8z8X \u2014 Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) October 24, 2019\n\nJill Filipovic, a lawyer who wrote the 2017 book \u201cThe H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness,\u201d pointed out that the dominant focus in Hill\u2019s case appeared to be on the alleged affairs rather than on the revenge porn, which she argued could deter other women from aspiring to public office.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to have consistent standards and say that sexual relationships with underlings are not appropriate, whether the boss is male or female,\u201d she wrote in a Medium essay last week. \u201cBut if we care about gender equality and the ability for women to fully participate in the public sphere, the sexualized attacks against Hill are the most pressing matter.\u201d\n\nOther critics noted that Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.) was accused by federal prosecutors in June of using taxpayer money to fund extramarital affairs with congressional staff members and lobbyists. The House Ethics Committee opened an investigation of Hunter\u2019s conduct in September 2018, after he was originally indicted on charges of wire fraud and misuse of campaign money. But despite pressure from some lawmakers to resign, Hunter has remained in Congress. He has denied wrongdoing, and as The Washington Post reported previously, the ethics panel has deferred taking action as federal prosecutors conclude their own inquiry.\n\nIt may be the right call for Hill to resign. But I\u2019m troubled by the focus on her affair -problematic as it is- and the relative lack of focus on revenge porn, which is many magnitudes worse. Fear of this kind of exposure = why women don\u2019t run for office. https://t.co/aPNDBd6nNc https://t.co/4x59jvRz2C \u2014 Jill Filipovic (@JillFilipovic) October 27, 2019\n\nThe House rule that prompted the ethics panel to investigate Hill\u2019s alleged relationship with congressional staff member Graham Kelly was passed in February 2018, during the peak of the #MeToo movement fallout. For the first time in Congress, the House resolution addressed the improper power dynamics of consensual relationships between members of Congress and their employees by banning any such relationship, while further protecting accusers who come forward with sexual harassment claims.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the time the law passed, nine members of Congress had recently resigned or announced their departures amid allegations of sexual misconduct or related impropriety \u2014 including one case that also involved leaked nude photos.\n\nFormer congressman Joe Barton Tex.) announced he would not seek reelection in 2018 after a nude photo of him circulated on Twitter and across the Internet, leading to revelations that the Republican, who was then married but separated from his wife, was having affairs with multiple women. In a November 2017 statement, Barton apologized for not using \u201cbetter judgment,\u201d saying he let down his constituents while acknowledging consensual sexual relationships he had had with other women.\n\nA recording of a phone call Barton had with one woman, obtained by The Post, revealed him telling the woman not to disseminate the explicit photos or else he would report her to the Capitol Police. Some argued that Barton was a victim of revenge porn, while others questioned whether the nude photo he had sent was unsolicited.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut one notable difference between Barton\u2019s case and Hill\u2019s is that right-wing publications chose to release the photos, especially because they depicted \u201ca politician of the opposing party,\u201d Quinta Jurecic, managing editor of Lawfare, a legal blog, wrote in an op-ed.\n\n\u201cThis is an ugly line to have crossed,\u201d she wrote, adding: \u201cThe United States has not historically had a culture in which political media outlets publish nude photographs of opposition politicians for sport. It\u2019s also a disappointing irony that this is taking place in a period in which legislatures are increasingly recognizing the harm of nonconsensual pornography.\u201d\n\nBy her own account Katie Hill behaved poorly; the question of whether that behavior alone merited resignation is a separate discussion. But the publication of nonconsensual pornography is never justified, and the willingness of right-wing media to post and repost it is troubling. https://t.co/pyJHJumdqO \u2014 Quinta Jurecic (@qjurecic) October 28, 2019\n\nAccording to the Cyber Civil Rights Institute, 46 states and the District of Columbia have revenge porn laws \u2014 and California, Hill\u2019s home state, is among them. Reps. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) and John Katko (R-N.Y.) also reintroduced bipartisan legislation in May that would federally criminalize sharing sexually explicit images of someone without that person\u2019s consent. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), a Democratic presidential candidate, has introduced companion legislation in the Senate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMary Anne Franks, a professor at the University of Miami School of Law who helped draft the first measure against nonconsensual pornography, urged the passage of the bill, known as the SHIELD Act, and spoke out in support of Hill on Twitter.\n\n\u201cOne of the many terrible effects of nonconsensual pornography is how it can be used to drive women out of politics,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs we at [Cyber Civil Rights Institute] have been emphasizing for years, \u2018revenge porn\u2019 very often serves as a tool of abusive partners and a means to silence women.\u201d\n\nHill was elected to Congress in 2018, unseating Republican Steve Knight to become the first woman to hold the seat in California\u2019s 25th Congressional District, near Los Angeles. A spokeswoman for Hill said she is still deciding when her resignation will take effect, while Politico reported that she is expected to leave by the end of the week.\n\nIn the closing of her resignation letter, Hill thanked her supporters for \u201callowing me to turn my focus to this particular battle right now,\u201d referring to the release of the nude photos.\n\n\u201cNow, my fight is going to be to defeat this type of exploitation that so many women are victims to and which will keep countless women and girls from running for office or entering public light,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAD", "description": "The circumstances of the California Democrat's resignation have led many critics to acknowledge the unusual situation in which Hill is both accused of sexual impropriety and a victim of sexual exploitation.", "authors": ["Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Pt__HWvZMTT2PNWHvgOmO4qCySo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FECPNOHZHEI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
