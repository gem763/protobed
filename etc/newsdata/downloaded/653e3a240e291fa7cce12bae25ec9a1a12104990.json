Christopher Stevens, U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith, and CIA contractors and former Navy SEALs Glen \u201cBub\u201d Doherty and Tyrone Woods were killed on Sept. 11, 2012, when the compound was ambushed in a coordinated attack by the Islamic militant group Ansar al-Sharia.\n\nDespite the loss of four lives, more than 20 others were saved because of the \u201cnever quit\u201d attitude of former Army Ranger Kris \u201cTanto\u201d Paronto and other members of the CIA annex security team who fought the attackers for 13 hours.\n\nParonto said he wanted to share that lesson, and more, with whoever's willing to listen.\n\n\u201cI still speak quite a bit about lessons learned from Benghazi and other deployments,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cTo me, it really doesn't seem like that long ago; it's still on the forefront of my mind. Looking back, I\u2019ve always thought of it as a heroic time \u2013 guys laid their lives on the line, and two of our teammates died saving peoples\u2019 lives.\u201d\n\nWhile he's often thought about what happened and the memory of his teammates Doherty and Woods, Paronto says he opted to look for the silver lining rather than stew about what \u201ccould\u201d have happened.\n\nFIRST FEMALE US AIRMAN EARNS RANGER TAB\n\nHe has traveled across the country speaking at various events and to corporate groups, sharing the lessons of Benghazi.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the success of leadership and never giving up, never quitting on yourself in the face of adversity,\u201d Paronto said. \u201cIt\u2019s the failures, too.\u201d\n\nHowever, turning anger and loss into positivity has not been easy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now a positive vehicle to help people,\u201d Paronto said of the attack, noting that his views have changed since that day. Paronto had criticized then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, slamming what he called her inaction and saying it led to the compound's vulnerability.\n\nAn 800-page report that took two years to complete found in 2016 that Clinton and other members of the Obama administration failed to protect the American diplomats at Benghazi. Clinton has claimed there was \u201cno actionable intelligence\u201d to indicate a coordinated attack, but many critics have said she failed to realize the potential risk.\n\nFORMER CIA OFFICER CALLS JAMES COMEY'S HANDLING OF TRUMP INVESTIGATION 'HORRIFYING'\n\n\u201cI still have my views,\u201d Paronto said. \u201cI still support the Second Amendment. I still love God. I still love the flag. I\u2019m still very patriotic. But, I felt like I was becoming the poster child for a group of people that hated everything. I had to stop it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are all Americans,\" he continued. \"I realized I need to try and start helping people with this story and bring people together rather than push them apart.\u201d\n\nWhile he said he still got \u201ca little angry\u201d sometimes when questioning why his team was \u201cleft behind\u201d in Benghazi, those emotions were \u201cfleeting and dissipating because of me realizing I can help people,\" Paronto said. \u201cIt made me happier.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cPlus, you can\u2019t keep ramming your head against a brick wall.\u201d\n\nThe advice he's taught was the \u201cstuff we\u2019ve known for years,\u201d he said, crediting his military training and what he learned from his dad while growing up in west Texas.\n\n\u201cMy dad always said, 'If you fall off that horse, son, you get back up on it,'\u201d he recalled. \u201cPeople have forgotten to get back on the horse.\u201d\n\nAgain, a lesson from Benghazi.\n\n\u201cDo we stop fighting because 'Bub' and Tyrone just got blown up? Or, do we keep fighting through that until we come out the other side?\u201d Paronto asked.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cNever quit \u2013 it's a common theme with a lot of veterans, and it\u2019s especially true of the Special Operations community,\" he said. \"You just don\u2019t give up, no matter what\u2019s going on or what you\u2019re going through. You take steps forward and eventually, you\u2019ll come out of it,\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the strongest person in the room when I talk to groups,\u201d Paronto added. \u201cBut, if I can fight through the death of my teammates, watching them die, then you can push on if something in your life is not what you want it to be.\u201d", "description": "\"I realized I need to try and start helping people with this story and bring people together rather than push them apart.\u201d", "authors": ["Melissa Leon"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Paronto-K-Photo-High-Res-Standing.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
