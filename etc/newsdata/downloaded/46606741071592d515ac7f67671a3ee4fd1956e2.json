Interior Secretary David Bernhardt transferred 560 acres of land to the Army for about 70 miles of barrier in Arizona, California and Texas.\n\nSanford said the partisan debate over the wall has created \u201chyperbole\u201d on both sides of the aisle, making it difficult for lawmakers to pass legislation for even smaller portion of barriers.\n\n\u201cIt's such an overblown argument. You\u2019ve got about 700 miles of secure or quasi-secure border. You\u2019ve got about 1,300 miles of open border presently,\u201d Sanford said before adding, \u201cthis is not about closing the entire border.\"", "description": "Former South Carolina Gov.
