Both of them.\n\n\"I couldn\u2019t marry them, I\u2019m too insecure. I\u2019d be like, \u2018You\u2019re too attractive, you\u2019re never allowed to leave the house.'\"\n\nAfter her date with Liam, this insecurity may have ebbed away, as she becomes the first person to be romantically linked to Liam since his split from Miley.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
