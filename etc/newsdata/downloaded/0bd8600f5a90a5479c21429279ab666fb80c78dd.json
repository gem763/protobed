George & Me, Andrew, 56, wrote: \u201cA terrible additional worry was the emergence of AIDS.\n\n\u201cI know I wasn\u2019t the only friend of George\u2019s who worried about him during that uncertain, frightening period.\u201d\n\nAndrew recalled that he was surprised when George came out, but said he just wanted George to be happy - in an era where homophobia was rife.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nGeorge had called Andrew into a room with his friend and backing singer, Shirlie Holliman.\n\n\u201cWhen I walked across the hallway to George\u2019s room, Shirlie was already there, perched on a large sofa in the suite. George was still in bed. He smiled as I came in\", wrote Andrew.\n\n\u201cThe mood in the room was so relaxed and familiar, yet what George was about to reveal was clearly a big deal for him.\n\n\u201c\u2018I didn\u2019t know whether to tell you this\u2019, he said, looking across at Shirlie, 'but I\u2019m going to. I\u2019m gay\u2019.\u201d\n\nShirlie, who already knew, had reassured George that Andrew would not have an issue with George coming out, after he expressed fears to her.\n\nGeorge's partner Anselmo Feleppa tragically died from AIDs in 1993.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Redferns)\n\nAndrew wrote: \u201cIt had devastated him but he\u2019d been unable to discuss it in public.\n\nHad he spoken out earlier, who knows how differently things might have played out.\u201d\n\nGeorge died from heart and liver disease at age 53, three years ago on Christmas Day 2016.\n\nAndrew said of George's untimely passing: \"He seemed to be in good health at the time and there are conflicting reports surrounding that night that preceded his passing.\n\n\"It now seems as if we may never know what really happened.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like our lives being monitored, so when someone dies alone, perhaps there are always answers that remain out of reach.\n\n\u201cIt still feels uncomfortable though. God knows what it must be like for George\u2019s family.\u201d\n\n(Image: AFP)\n\nIn 1998, the Careless Whisper singer was forced to come out after being arrested in Beverly Hills for soliciting sex in a public toilet.\n\nAndrew also revealed that he and George had a saucy history of reading pornographic magazines together in secret in a field by George's house, when they were teenagers.\n\nGeorge then persuaded Andrew to visit an adult cinema with him, but they were put off by other men in the audience treating the viewing as an \u201cinteractive experience\u201d by attempting to perform sex acts on themselves.\n\nThe pair then tried to watch a live sex show together, but soon changed their minds after realising they had to pay \u00a320 for drinks.\n\nWham! George & Me, by Andrew Ridgeley, is out now.", "description": "George Michael's former bandmate Andrew Ridgeley has spoken out about his fears the star would die from AIDS", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Getty Images", "Redferns", "Afp"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20408206.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Wham.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
