On an inflation-adjusted basis, Americans families are earning just 2.7% more than they did in 1999, when median household income stood at $61,526, or 2007, when the median household income was about $61,000.\n\nThe data illustrate why 4 in 10 Americans sometimes face what economists call \"material hardship,\" struggling to pay for basic needs such as food and housing. While income has barely inched upwards during the past two decades, costs for essentials such as health care and housing has soared, pinching budgets for many Americans.\n\n\"Most families have just barely made up the ground lost over the past decade,\" Elise Gould, a senior economist with the Economic Policy Institute, said in a statement.\n\nOne caveat is that the income figures reflect pre-tax income, which means that any benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump at the end of 2017, wouldn't be reflected in the data.\n\nMore uninsured Americans\n\nThe latest Census figures also show that the ranks of Americans without health insurance jumped last year, rising from 25.6 million uninsured in 2017 to 27.5 million in 2018. On a percent basis, the share of uninsured Americans rose from 7.9% to 8.5%, reflecting the first year-over-year increase since 2008-09, the agency said.\n\nHigh health insurance deductibles are causing financial hardship\n\nThe increase in uninsured Americans is striking partly because of the economy's expansion and increased payrolls. At the same time, the Trump administration has been seeking to weaken the Affordable Care Act, while also approving work requirements for Medicaid, the health care program for low-income workers. Medicaid enrollment fell 0.7% last year, the Census said.\n\nThe nation's poverty rate declined last year to 11.8 percent, 0.5 percentage points lower than in 2017, the Census said. The South was the only region where poverty failed to improve, with the poverty rate in southern states standing at 13.6%, little changed from 2017.", "description": "New Census data show that family earnings were largely flat in 2018 and still haven't surpassed their 1999 peak", "authors": ["Aimee Picchi"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/10/97800bac-f37b-4447-9c02-54492c0f0521/thumbnail/1200x630/1179a467948c2fa865e38420ecab3d6a/rts2ivub.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
