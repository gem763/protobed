Similar scenes were repeated in towns and cities all along the long, narrow South American country of 18 million people.\n\nMillions of students were still unable to attend classes, several subway stations were shut and long lines continued to form outside gas stations and supermarkets after many were torched or destroyed.\n\nThe unrest erupted last week when students began to jump subway station turnstiles to protest against a four-cent subway fare rise that the Chilean government said was needed to cope with rising oil prices and a weaker currency.\n\nMost of the protests have been peaceful, with demonstrators of all ages banging pots to demand reforms. But the unrest also involved riots, arson and looting that have racked Chile for six days, nearly paralyzing a country long seen as an oasis of stability.\n\nHuman rights groups have expressed concerns about how security forces have handled the protests after the government ordered a military curfew. It was the first such curfew \u2013 other than for natural disasters \u2013 imposed since the country returned to democracy in 1990 following a bloody 17-year military dictatorship.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re worried,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, told the Associated Press. \u201cThe images that we\u2019ve received from credible sources, trustworthy sources, show that there has been an excess of force both by police as well as some soldiers.\u201d\n\nAbout 20,000 soldiers are patrolling the streets, nearly 200 people have been injured and about 5,000 have been arrested.\n\nIf Pi\u00f1era wants to wage war in Chile he should fight the real enemy: inequality | Crist\u00f3bal Rovira Kaltwasser Read more\n\nOn Tuesday night, Pi\u00f1era announced economic reforms including an increase in the state pension and a minimum wage hike. But many say the 69-year-old billionaire businessman reacted late and the announcement failed to calm anger in the streets.\n\nThe protests divided Chileans.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what can happen to you,\u201d said retiree Magaly Mu\u00f1oz. \u201cI understand that people are dissatisfied, but they can\u2019t break into your home and loot businesses. I can\u2019t support that.\u201d\n\nAfter the protests erupted, Pi\u00f1era reversed the subway hike while also declaring a state of emergency. He said this week that Chile is \u201cat war\u201d.\n\nHe then took a more conciliatory tone, apologizing and announcing an agenda calling for increasing the lowest monthly pensions from $151 to $181, raising the monthly minimum wage from $413 to $481 and rescinding a 92% rise in electricity rates scheduled to take effect next month. It would also include a tax increase for anyone earning more than $11,000 a month.", "description": "Thousands take to streets of Santiago for sixth day running after Pi\u00f1era scraps fare hike and raises pensions and minimum wage", "authors": ["Associated Press In Santiago"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd177661258d27e27621231e0aae1e038a59a61a/0_109_3870_2322/master/3870.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=28814a22e3751473e23468250b63f3d7", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
