I hope a miracle does happen, but I don't think we'll see her,\" Mr Bambridge told The Guardian.\n\n\"I spoke to her [before her trip] about safety, safety, safety, safety. And she was like, 'Yeah', she knew about all that. She was always reliable, switched on.\n\n\"But I think she still broke her own rules. She had her safety rules, and she let them slip, and she's now paid the ultimate price.\"\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nMr Bamford earlier reviewed CCTV footage of his daughter leaving her hotel at 2am to go to the beach party in order to clear up what had been conflicting timings provided by the authorities.\n\n\"We were getting conflicting times of when she got there,\" he told Sky News.\n\n\"I don't think she's in the sea, I think she's inland somewhere.\n\n\"I think someone's taken her. I don't think she's had an accident, if she'd had an accident she would have been found.\"\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAs the effort to find her continued yesterday around 150 people were split into two groups, with one searching the ocean and the other the jungle.\n\nAmelia set off on her trip on September 27, when she flew to Vietnam, her family said.\n\nThey were alerted to her disappearance after she failed to check out of the Nest Beach Club hostel.\n\nHer passport remained at the hostel.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nStaff at Police Beach, a private venue that stages regular events, found Ms Bambridge's purple rucksack, containing her purse, phone and bank cards, the morning after she went missing.\n\nGeorgie Bambridge spoke to her sister on the phone in the hours before she was last seen.\n\n\"She went to the Police Beach party on Wednesday night - the last time I spoke to her was Wednesday daytime,\" she told Sky News .\n\n(Image: ViralPress)\n\n\"She said it was doing so much for her confidence and she found so many people who were friendly.\n\n\"She said 'Everyone is so cool here' and couldn't be happier.\"\n\nShe went on to say that her \"role model\" sister \"would never drink to excess\" and was \"always in control\", adding: \"She would always be looking out for me, it's not like her to not look after herself.\n\n\"I just don't know what's happened.\"", "description": "Amelia's dad Phil has spoken of how difficult the Worthing, West Sussex, family are finding the search for the backpacker Koh Rong island, Cambodia", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Facebook", "Viralpress"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20748929.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_261019Slug_11136JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
