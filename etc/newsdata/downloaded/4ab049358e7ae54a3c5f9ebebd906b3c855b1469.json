Now it has to decide how to prevent these problems from recurring.\n\nShortages of funds that banks were willing to lend on Sept. 16 and 17 led interest rates in very short-term lending markets to rise sharply. In response, the Fed injected billions of dollars of cash to pull rates down to their target range.\n\nFed officials discussed the issue at their policy meeting on Sept. 17 and 18, and minutes of that gathering -- to be released Wednesday -- will provide some details on their thinking.\n\nAmong the decisions they face: when and how to resume increasing the size of their asset portfolio -- often referred to as the balance sheet -- and whether to create new tools to reduce money market volatility.\n\nThe Fed also will have to clarify that such moves are aimed at smoothing out market operations, not providing new economic stimulus.\n\nFed policy makers set their benchmark federal-funds rate to influence a suite of short-term rates at which banks lend to each other overnight, including in the \"repo\" market for collateralized short-term loans. A sudden shortage of cash in this market cause repo rates to surge on Sept. 16 and 17, prompting the Fed intervention.\n\nThe repo market is an arcane but important part of the financial system. With $1 trillion in funding flowing through it every day, any disruptions -- if allowed to fester -- could influence the rates businesses and consumers pay and also drag on economic growth.\n\nThe Fed's intervention in repo markets, which will continue at least through early November, were standard operating procedure before the 2008 crisis. But today they amount to a temporary Band-Aid, which is why officials must now settle on a permanent fix.\n\nSome analysts say last month's rupture shows how the Fed's delays in finalizing nuts-and-bolts decisions that could have been made months or years ago -- either because officials couldn't reach agreement or didn't feel urgency to do so -- has now forced the central bank to play catch up.\n\nAt issue is some complex monetary plumbing. To boost growth after the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed bought bonds to push down long-term interest rates and drive up asset prices. These purchases flooded the banking sector with deposits held at the central bank, known as reserves.\n\nBefore the 2008 crisis, the Fed kept its balance sheet at less than $1 trillion. The size was dictated primarily by demand for the Fed's liabilities, which include currency, reserves and the Treasury's financing account. The Fed shifted the supply of reserves up and down in incremental amounts to adjust short-term rates.\n\nThe crisis changed everything. With the banking system awash with reserves, the Fed devised new tools to control interest rates. It started paying interest on these reserves directly to banks, raising or lowering the interest rate on reserves to change the interest rates banks charged each other.\n\nLater, the Fed wanted to demonstrate that its crisis-era stimulus could be withdrawn and began shrinking the balance sheet two years ago. Officials stopped the process this past summer and are now holding its portfolio steady at $3.9 trillion, but that means any increases in nonreserve liabilities lead to a one-for-one decline in reserves.\n\nThe Fed now has to decide when to allow the balance sheet to start growing again to keep up with demand for the central bank's liabilities. Officials knew that eventually, reserves would reach a level low enough that banks would charge more to lend to each other in overnight markets, but didn't think they would hit that point this soon.\n\nThe Fed will study whether postcrisis financial rules or informal guidance from regulators changed banks' behavior in a way that amplified recent market stress.\n\n\"Essentially, the Fed underestimated the system's demand for liquidity and allowed its balance sheet to shrink too much,\" said Roberto Perli, an analyst at Cornerstone Macro.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell said last month that officials would consider resuming balance sheet growth at their Oct. 29 and 30 meeting, but many market participants \"are now hoping for something more audacious,\" said Lou Crandall, chief economist at financial-research firm Wrightson ICAP.\n\nSome current and former Fed officials think the easiest fix would be to build a \"buffer\" of reserves $150 billion or $250 billion above mid-September's low watermark by buying Treasury securities.\n\n\"The way to address [reserve scarcity] is to start growing our reserves...and maybe increase [them] enough that we don't have to do as many high-frequency interventions,\" Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said in an interview.\n\nIf Fed officials choose this option, they must also decide how fast to build up reserves and what mix of Treasury securities to buy. One way to limit the perception that such purchases represent new stimulus would be to buy shorter-term Treasury bills instead of the longer-dated notes and bonds the Fed bought after the 2008 crisis.\n\nOfficials believe holding long-term securities boosts the economy and financial markets by lowering long-term rates and driving investors into stocks and bonds. They think a portfolio weighted toward shorter-term securities provides less stimulus.\n\nThe Fed also could add new tools. Officials in June debated creating a so-called standing repo facility that would allow banks to exchange Treasurys for reserves without the stigma of emergency borrowing at the Fed's discount window.\n\nOfficials would have to determine certain details, including which financial institutions would have access and what interest rates to charge. They don't appear to be close to making any decisions.\n\nThe discussions about this tool \"are in their infancy, and there is more work to be done,\" said Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker in a speech last month.\n\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 06, 2019 10:14 ET (14:14 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
