Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsMcConnell: We'll see if Pelosi's impeachment rules resolution 'passes the smell test' The Hill's 12:30 Report: White House official testifies he warned about Trump pressure on Ukraine The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Dems shift strategy on impeachment vote MORE (R-Maine) was the only Republican to vote for the resolution.\n\nDemocrats wanted to overturn a Trump administration rule on so-called 1332 waivers that makes it easier for states to opt out of certain ObamaCare requirements and prioritize cheaper, less-inclusive plans than ones offered under ObamaCare.\n\nMembers of the party have termed the plans \"junk insurance\" because companies can refuse to cover people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nRepublicans argued the rule gives states more flexibility.\n\nRead more here.\n\nLawsuit claims Juul knowingly sold 1 million 'contaminated' pods\n\nE-cigarette company Juul knowingly shipped 1 million \"contaminated\" pods to retailers this year and refused to recall the products or warn consumers, a former executive claimed in a lawsuit he filed against the company this week.\n\nSiddharth Breja, who served as Juul's senior vice president of global finance in 2018 and 2019, is suing the company for damages, arguing he was \"terminated in retaliation\" for being a whistleblower.\n\nIn the lawsuit filed Tuesday in the Northern District of California, Breja said he was fired after objecting to the shipment and raising concerns about other instances of \"illegal and unsafe conduct\" that \"jeopardized\" public health and the lives of consumers.\n\nJuul, which dominates the e-cigarette market in the U.S., has had a tumultuous year as it battles accusations that it purposely marketed to kids.\n\nMeanwhile, federal health officials are investigating an outbreak of lung illnesses among patients that vaped THC and nicotine products.\n\nIn his lawsuit, Breja did not say what the shipped pods were allegedly contaminated with, but he noted they were mint flavored -- one of the company's best-selling products.\n\nWhy it matters: Anti-tobacco advocates have long-argued e-cigarette companies aren't careful enough about what they put in their products. That a former employee is alleging Juul knowingly sold contaminated products is a big deal, especially as health officials try to learn more about the outbreak of lung illnesses associated with vaping.\n\nThe other side: Juul contends Breja is a disgruntled former employee who was fired for being a bad leader.\n\n\"He was terminated in March 2019 because he failed to demonstrate the leadership qualities needed in his role,\" the spokesperson said. \"The allegations concerning safety issues with Juul products are equally meritless, and we already investigated the underlying manufacturing issue and determined the product met all applicable specifications. The company will vigorously defend this lawsuit.\"\n\nRead more on the allegations here.\n\nBiden aide: 'Alarming' that Sanders won't release details of paying for Medicare for All\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenWhite House official says transcript of Ukraine call omitted key phrases: report Biden uses National Cat Day to fundraise for putting a 'pet back in White House' Sondland emerges as key target after Vindman testimony MORE's campaign is attacking Sen.

But beginning in 2017, the number of uninsured children began to rise.\n\nThe report specifically cited the confusion surrounding the administration's failed attempt to repeal ObamaCare, the successful elimination of the law's individual mandate and a months-long delay in funding the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\n\nIn addition, the report cited the Trump administration's decision to dramatically cut ObamaCare outreach and enrollment grants while also shortening the open enrollment period.\n\nWhy it matters: It follows a larger trend of growing uninsured rates under the Trump administration, which the Census has largely attributed to people dropping or losing Medicaid coverage.\n\nRead more on the numbers here.\n\nWhat we're reading\n\nJohnson & Johnson's own expert, working for FDA, found asbestos in baby powder (Reuters)\n\nHow Americans split on health care: it's a 3-way tie (The New York Times)\n\nWarren: 'I'm glad to talk to Bernie' about Medicare for All (CNN.com)\n\nObamaCare tax at issue as Humana cuts hundreds of jobs (WDRB Louisville)\n\nState by state\n\nMaine ACA enrollment expected to drop as state continues its Medicaid expansion (Press Herald)\n\nHealth care is on the ballot in state elections starting next week (Vox)\n\nThe Hill op-eds\n\nCan we afford more unintended consequences?", "description": "Welcome to Wednesday's Overnight Health Care.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/drugs_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
