But it should also make clear that it will not investigate or punish students over subjectively demeaning behavior \u2014 or costumes \u2014 alone.\u201d\n\nIn May 2016, leftist student activists at Yale University infamously yelled at Professor Nicholas Christakis over his decision to defend an open letter that criticized Yale\u2019s decision to play an active role in policing Halloween costumes.\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus updates.", "description": "A policy buried in the Furman University handbook claims that students can be punished for wearing offensive Halloween costumes.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Halloween-costumes-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
