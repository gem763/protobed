That comes with its set of challenges.\n\nCast of \"Victorious\" at Nickelodeon's 23rd Annual Kids' Choice Awards red carpet.

And although she has no plans to stop working in TV, she does enjoy the freedom that comes with YouTube.\n\n\"I think the real reason I got involved with YouTube was because I just wanted a place to have longer-form content that told more of a story,\" she said.\n\nIf you're on TV, people feel like they already know you. But Monet said fans are really more familiar with the character you've played, and not who you actually are.\n\nComing from a traditional acting background, Monet always had a team behind her producing the content she appeared in. That changed with YouTube. At first, she tried outsourcing the editing, but she said she preferred the way a video came out when she edited it herself.\n\n\"It was a learning curve for me to not only create the content, but to finish the content and promote the content,\" she said.\n\nMonet shares life announcements in vlog-style videos on her YouTube channel, like when her boyfriend proposed (2.6 million views) and when she found out she was pregnant (2 million views).\n\nMonet is one of a slew of traditional actors \u2014 like Will Smith, Jennette McCurdy (iCarly), and Jack Black \u2014 who have started sharing their everyday lives on YouTube.\n\nInvesting in eco-conscious and vegan companies.\n\nBecause of her acting career, Monet didn't attend traditional school. She finished her GED online and took business classes later in life at a local college. But she started investing early, she said.\n\n\"I was a young kid, making pretty decent money for my age,\" she said. \"I wanted to learn about different ways of saving your income, so I started investing at about 16 years old.\"\n\nMonet has invested in several eco-conscious companies. Outstanding Foods was her first significant investment, with lead investor and fellow actor Rob Dyrdek, as well as other influencers, actors, and athletes as investors.\n\nRecently, Outstanding Foods \"Pig Out Chips\" went viral on social media and was featured in Whole Foods Market's top 10 trends for 2019.\n\nHer beauty investment, Kinder Beauty Box, is a cruelty-free and vegan monthly subscription box. It ships with 100% recycled and eco-friendly materials \u2014 even the ink used to print the logo is soy-based, not made from petroleum. She often features it on her Instagram.\n\nMonet has also invested in the female-owned Los Angeles vegan taco shop, Sugar Taco \u2014 which she said will plant a tree for every meal sold.\n\n'It's a part of my daily life.'\n\nMonet has been vegan for 17 years and said she chooses only to share and invest in companies that align with her lifestyle.\n\nThis is an especially important topic for influencers, who don't want to alienate their audience by promoting products that don't fit their personality.\n\n\"Anything that I have invested in or cofounded, I have truly tried and tested everything, it's a part of my daily life,\" Monet said. \"People want to know that they can trust you. It's not worth it to take those easy campaigns for X amount of money if it's not something you stand by.\"\n\nYouTube star Alisha Marie, who has eight million subscribers, echoed this sentiment in a recent interview with Business Insider.\n\n\"The audience knows, you can't trick them,\" Marie said. She also said she turns down more brand deals than she accepts.\n\nMonet said she sees her platform both as an opportunity to promote her investments and also to spread the \"eco-conscious\" message she is passionate about.\n\n\"If I can influence anyone just by the way that I live my life, and be a role model, then I've done my job,\" she said.", "description": "From playing a part on Nickelodeon, to sharing her everyday life on YouTube, actress and entrepreneur Daniella Monet shares her experience in media.", "authors": ["Amanda Perelli"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d960640270f2d20b5506f0e?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
