Now they are busy breaking new barriers\n\nThere was a time in the early 2000s when it felt as though no public toilet was safe from the guerrilla stickering of Mooncup fans. Festivals, university loos, clubs and pubs \u2013 if someone could be sat with their knickers down, then the chances are there would be a little white sticker in front of them offering a \u201csafer, greener, cheaper\u201d period.\n\nExcept they didn\u2019t use the word period back then. In 2002, when Mooncup \u2013 the world\u2019s first reusable silicone menstrual cup \u2013 was launched by two women in Brighton, the word was still taboo. \u201cPeople were revolted by what we were doing,\u201d says Eileen Greene, one of the founders and directors of the company. \u201cPeople really weren\u2019t talking about periods at all. We were quite radical. We would do stalls at festivals and trade shows and we would call it the \u2018repulsion zone\u2019 \u2013 this semicircle around the stall where people wouldn\u2019t even want to come near us.\u201d\n\nWhat a difference 17 years make. I meet Greene and Kath Clements \u2013 another of Mooncup\u2019s directors, who joined in 2005, in their Brighton offices. They have outgrown the bedroom in the Whitehawk estate where the company was founded, when a team of two were cramped between piles of leaflets, cups and stickers. Now a 40-strong outfit, Mooncup has a proper office and a kitchen with a long wooden table, which is where the staff cook and eat a vegan lunch together every day. They do yoga here, too, and meditation. \u201cIt\u2019s just what we\u2019ve always done,\u201d says Greene.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with the Mooncup, think of it as a bendy silicone eggcup, that, when inserted into the vagina, collects menstrual blood. You can leave it in for around eight hours, because it holds about three times as much fluid as a regular tampon. When you take it out, you just tip the blood away, give it a rinse (a water bottle will do if you don\u2019t want to use the public sink) and reinsert it. Each Mooncup lasts for about 10 years, so the \u00a322 price tag should recoup itself after six months of saving on other sanitary products. I have a friend who has been using one since her teens and, now in her mid 30s, has only ever spent about \u00a340 on her period in her whole life. Then, of course, there is the environmental benefit of ridding the world of the estimated 200,000 tonnes of sanitary waste that ends up in landfill in the UK each year.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest New look: 17 years after it first appeared, Mooncup has reinvented itself with new packaging\n\nAnd it is finally catching on. In the past five years, sales have risen by 98%. The story of the Mooncup is not just about the power of ethical business, but also word-of-mouth marketing in a sector that is dominated by multinational corporations. It has, after all, gone from a niche product sold in healthfood stores to being stocked in Boots and Asos.\n\nThis month marks a major turning point, too: for the first time since the product\u2019s launch, the packaging has been redesigned to show the cup on the front of the box. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a white box with a flower on it,\u201d says Greene. \u201cWhich was a way of saying: \u2018Look, this isn\u2019t a scary thing.\u2019 Now, we feel able to be more up front.\u201d\n\nIn the past decade there has been a dramatic cultural shift away from the hushed tones and euphemisms used for anything related to a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle. \u201cIn 2015, you could really see the taboo around periods starting to break,\u201d says Clements. She points to the tennis player Heather Watson saying that she performed poorly in the Australian Open because of her period and the musician Kiran Gandhi, who ran the London Marathon free bleeding, as key moments in changing public discourse around menstruation that year. \u201cAnd we\u2019d played our part in that \u2013 very committedly trying to shift the conversation around periods,\u201d she says. But she emphasises that this is a shift restricted to the UK: \u201cBecause in many countries, it is not the case at all.\u201d\n\nThe first menstrual cup was invented by an American actor, Leona Chalmers, who patented her runner cup in 1937. Greene stumbled on the idea in the late 1990s, when a woman on a Critical Mass bike ride through London told her about them. \u201cI was like: \u2018Wow, I\u2019ve never heard of anything like that.\u2019\u201d A year later, Greene went travelling around Australia. \u201cI was camping in Boonoo Boonoo national park and opposite me was this British family. There was a woman washing reusable nappies in a bucket \u2013 which you really didn\u2019t see very often back then, and I was intrigued.\u201d That woman was Su Hardy, whom Greene would tell about the menstrual cup. Hardy was so enthralled that, when she got back to the UK, she managed to track one down in the US. \u201cAt that time, they were fairly rudimentary rubber cups. She started importing them on a small scale, and selling then to friends of friends. They were OK, but some people had a reaction to the latex, so that got her thinking: \u2018How can I improve this? And she came up with the idea of making it from medical-grade silicone instead. She made it a 21st-century product.\u201d\n\nBy this point, Hardy had moved to Brighton and the fledgling business operated out of her house. \u201cIt was so chaotic,\u201d says Clements. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even move your chair.\u201d The stickers were Hardy\u2019s idea. \u201cSu\u2019s one-woman crusade,\u201d laughs Clements. \u201cShe was going around stickering public toilets. Every day, she\u2019d run off to the post office with this wicker basket full of orders. Each Mooncup would come with a sticker, so our users started stickering, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a different concept to the tampons and pads that we\u2019ve all been used to using. People really need to hear it from someone else.\u201d\n\nThe women taking the plastic out of periods Read more\n\nThere was a natural hesitance among consumers, whose relationship with tampon brands is often embedded in their school years. \u201cI remember the Tampax lady coming into our school really fondly \u2013 which shows how clever they are about it,\u201d says Clements. It must be galling, then, to see rival menstrual cups flooding a market that they created. How do they feel about Tampax launching its own menstrual cup? \u201cThey have clearly seen a commercial opportunity, that times are changing, and they\u2019ve jumped on the bandwagon,\u201d says Greene. Tampax\u2019s product, however, not only comes in a plastic container, but plastic packaging, too. \u201cYou would have hoped they would focus on eliminating single-use plastic. That would be a diligent environmental approach, rather than just adding another product to the range.\u201d\n\nAs for the other brands, Clements thinks it is worth cautiously celebrating that their efforts have \u201ctransformed the feminine hygiene aisle\u201d. Yet she warns that companies should also be thinking about \u201cwhere it\u2019s being manufactured and if colours are being added to it. Also, I\u2019ve seen some brands saying they need replacing every year, and some that come in plastic packaging.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An image from the company\u2019s Tampax v Mooncup rap battle advertising campaign from 2013. Photograph: Nathan Harrison\n\nThis distaste for waste is the reason Mooncup will not be expanding its range, says Greene. \u201cWe won\u2019t make wipes or washes \u2013 those paraphernalia of consumerism \u2013 because they are simply not needed.\u201d\n\nWhen Hardy retired in 2014, she transferred ownership of the business to the employees. Even the salaries are shared openly. \u201cI sometimes forget that this is quite radical practice,\u201d says Clements. Has it even been fraught? It can, she admits, be challenging at times. \u201cPeople bring a lot of personal feeling to conversations around money.\u201d\n\nI wonder if there was any disharmony about the decision to sell via Asos, given the criticism of the company\u2019s record on workers\u2019 rights and its warehouses, which have been described as \u201cdark satanic mills\u201d by unions. \u201cThey are clearly striving to improve,\u201d says Greene. \u201cFrom our perspective, it felt like an opportunity to reach a whole new demographic.\u201d\n\nAside from the fact some women may still feel squeamish about the idea of such close contact with menstrual blood (which users say is minimal), there are few criticisms of Mooncup. But it is not advisable for use in places where there is no clean water to sterilise it, or if an internal product is not suitable, says Greene.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest One of Mooncup\u2019s Love Your Vagina posters from 2010\n\nIn recent years, the company has ventured into advertising (working with an advertising agency that had been run as a workers\u2019 cooperative) but the directors are wary of pushing their ethical credentials too far. \u201cThere are so many voices claiming that they believe in a cause,\u201d says Clements. So they took a different approach. Firstly, it was the Love Your Vagina posters \u2013 which got them into hot water after people complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about the word \u201cvagina\u201d being on a poster. Then there was 2015\u2019s \u201cPeriod Drama\u201d \u2013 which poked fun at Poldark, by featuring a weak maiden on the back of a horse with a man, galloping to find her the right tampons when all she really needs is her Mooncup. \u201cThe aim was to allow space for the more complex feminist conversations to happen within advertising,\u201d says Clements.\n\nIn fact, the filming of the advert turned into a feminist drama in itself. \u201cWhen the trainer of the horse realised the job was for a sanitary product advert, he pulled out at the last minute. Because he thought the reputation of his horse would be sullied,\u201d Clements says with a laugh.\n\nI can\u2019t leave without telling the founders the only negative story I managed to extract from the dozens of Mooncup users I spoke to (who were all evangelical about its benefits). It was from a friend who said that, in 10 years, she had only \u201chad one leak,\u201d but described it as \u201capocalyptic\u201d. \u201cWith a tampon,\u201d she pointed out \u201cyou might get a dribble; with a Mooncup it\u2019s a small cupful.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d says Clements, thoughtfully. \u201cLeakage usually happens at the beginning. That\u2019s why we have the phone support service to help people who are new to using the cup. Often people place it too high up the vagina, because it\u2019s instinctively where you would put your tampon. Instead, you wear it lower to form a seal with the vaginal wall.\u201d She seems genuinely perplexed and promises to look into the matter.\n\nAs for the future, what is next for Mooncup is flaunting the new packaging, and trying to reach as many people as possible. Do Clements and Greene ever get bored of talking about periods all day long? \u201cIt\u2019s funny if you\u2019ve been working at a festival for a few days,\u201d says Clements. \u201cAt the end of the week, you often don\u2019t know people\u2019s names. But you know everybody\u2019s gynaecological history.\u201d", "description": "The makers of the silicone menstrual cup had to overcome the taboo around periods when they launched the company two decades ago.
