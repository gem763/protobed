But what do our readers make of it? WARNING: Contains spoilers\n\n\u2018It is a book for our times\u2019\n\nA gripping read, atmospheric and didn\u2019t disappoint! To me it resonates, to some degree, with what is happening in some parts of the World. Populism, treatment of women and the negative view by some of refugees and immigrants. It is a book for our times. I am sad as I feel it is unlikely to be read by those who would have the most to learn from it!\n\nA great novel and brilliant sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\n\nFran Gillam, 65, East Midlands\n\n\u2018It\u2019s poetry, and it\u2019s horror\u2019\n\nThe Testaments is incredible. It\u2019s poetry, and it\u2019s horror. It\u2019s a quick read, and yet it will never leave you. If you read The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, you already know the world Atwood created. If you read the news, you will understand why she has written a sequel.\n\nThe story is split between three main voices, each as true and flawed, as angry and as beautiful, as the others. As we read, we find ourselves understanding, through fiction, how fact is created. We look back into the layers of story. The book reads quite simply \u2013 no fancy, wordy phrases from this Booker nominee \u2013 but there is nothing simple about the tale. The regime is there, as it was in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, but the viewpoint has been changed, and with it, our sight. The true darkness of The Testaments is not just in the words Atwood writes, but the bits she leaves out, the spaces where we write our own nightmares, between the chapters.\n\nAsked what she thinks the world needs at the moment, Atwood says, Hope. The Testaments brings many things to the reader \u2013 sorrow, peace, anger \u2013 and it does indeed, give us hope, but like everything else, that hope comes with a price.\n\nIt\u2019s a brilliant and important book, and I almost wish I had never read it, so I could read it again for the first time.\n\nCath, 46, Ireland\n\nMargaret Atwood: \u2018For a long time we were moving away from Gilead. Then we started going back towards it\u2019 Read more\n\n\u2018Somehow this resonates\u2019\n\nI\u2019ve never read Atwood before. I watched the series, but not all \u2013 I found it grim, tortuous, although the end of season three was somewhat uplifting.\n\nNow I\u2019ve read The Testaments. I am not literary critic, but found it very sharp, very concise. The redemption of Aunt Lydia was a surprise, as was the understatement of the whole Gilead terror in comparison to the TV dramatisation.\n\nSome novels, after you finish them they fade, but somehow this resonates. I will not forget this book and its wider themes and issues.\n\nI was also expecting a feminist slant but never detected it. It is a story about humanity \u2013 thought provoking.\n\nAnonymous\n\n\u2018Perhaps inevitably the sequel couldn\u2019t live up to my expectations\u2019\n\nI\u2019m conflicted. I read The Handmaid\u2019s Tale in high school, when I was 14 or 15, and found it a transformative experience. I\u2019ve read it many times since and each time marvelled at the simplicity and beauty of the prose \u2013 like the words were carved out of stone. When I saw the poster for the sequel for the first time I was overjoyed; when I saw that it had been nominated for the Booker prize already, my hopes were sky high.\n\nSo perhaps inevitably the sequel couldn\u2019t live up to my expectations. I swept through it in a single day, loving the additional insights into Gilead and the horrifying expansion of the world ... even as a quiet but insistent part of me was saying: \u201cBut this isn\u2019t how that character would act,\u201d or \u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t be that easy\u201d, or \u201cBut that\u2019s too much of a coincidence.\u201d The ending was everything I\u2019d wanted but it also felt somehow too good to be true. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale was a warning (one that\u2019s been borne out in some ways) and The Testaments is saying not to worry, everything will work out OK in the end.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to rereading, in a few months. I haven\u2019t seen a single review that isn\u2019t glowing, and I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll like it more on a second time round, because I won\u2019t be so caught up in my own expectations.\n\nEmma Christoffersen, 29, Bermondsey, London\n\n\u2018A joy to read\u2019\n\nI read The Handmaid\u2019s Tale when it was first published and really enjoyed series one of the TV drama. The rest of it? Not so much. It lacked Atwood\u2019s touch and felt more like a TV executive\u2019s vision than hers.\n\nThe Testaments brings us so much more: Aunt Lydia\u2019s narrative casts a clear eye on Gilead and the cultural consequences of misogyny; that of Daisy/Jade/Nicole allows a contemporary take on how it appears from the outside; and Agnes\u2019s childhood and decision to join the Aunts shows us the difficult choices available inside a repressive regime. There are glorious touches of humour \u2013 for example the Aunts have to adopt names of cosmetics brands \u2013 and all of it in Atwood\u2019s perfect prose. A joy to read and, just like its predecessor, worth reading many times over.\n\nLisa Hennessy, 62, Herefordshire\n\nThe Testaments by Margaret Atwood review \u2013 a dazzling follow-up to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale Read more\n\n\u2018There\u2019s nothing new in it\u2019\n\nProfoundly disappointed. I read The Handmaid\u2019s Tale when it was first published; the power of it was that it made us see the world in a new way; made possibilities that seemed unimaginable seem all too imaginable. Like all of Atwood\u2019s work up to that point, it had understated heart to match its cleverness. The Testaments has none of that. There\u2019s nothing new in it; no new insight. The idea that Aunt Lydia was \u201cradicalised\u201d by a bit of torture and turned into the thing she ought to have abhorred is old, old, old. It\u2019s been so very much better done in so very many great novels over a couple of centuries at least. The point at which she suddenly \u201creveals herself\u201d to the young women is unbelievable, verging on plain silly. The other two narrators are callow, verging on plain dull. It\u2019s all plot and no insight. The one pleasure I took in it was the glorious precision of Aunt Lydia\u2019s voice. As for the rest of it: this seemed to be the work of a novelist overly impressed with her own cleverness, and so very lacking in heart. Everything that her clever, but heart-filled, earlier novels were not. Embarrassingly, I find myself looking to the TV series to be challenged and deepened.\n\nSharon Blackie, 58, Galway, Ireland\n\n\u2018Gripping, with good pacing\u2019\n\nAtwood introduces new characters to a familiar setting, so it feels more like a spin-off, or extension, than a direct sequel.\n\nWe hear the private thoughts of more characters from Gilead, which gives a wider range of viewpoints. Overall it\u2019s gripping, with good pacing, subtle plot development and excellent characterisation. It\u2019s also a highly relevant commentary on the oppression of women.\n\nCharlie Anderson, 49, Brighton\n\n\u2018I genuinely felt she was talking to me\u2019\n\nI ordered The Testaments and I was thrilled to find it outside my flat when I got home. I read it over two nights and enjoyed every well-crafted, delicious minute. It answered so many of my questions but also gave rise to a few more. Everything is wonderfully described, striking a perfect balance between painting the scene and the characters, and allowing the reader to visualise themselves in the moment and paint in some of the finer details. I cried near the end when AL describes who she believes her reader to be, I genuinely felt she was talking to me. To Margaret Atwood, I say thank you so very much for writing The Testaments and for answering so many of my questions.\n\nRuth Whitney, 39, Aberdeen, Scotland\n\n\u2018We got a sense of completion from the ending\u2019\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve anticipated a book as much as this since the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The narratives are fantastic and the exploration of the dominating Aunt Lydia is a thing that I\u2019ve wanted for so long.\n\nI felt that we got a sense of completion from the ending and that while it wasn\u2019t about Offred, I cried when I realised that they were all OK.\n\nAtwood has created this incredible universe and to realise that in the end, all the women \u2013 regardless of their status in Gilead \u2013 were on each other\u2019s side gives me hope in a world where we\u2019re pitted against each other.\n\nLauran Hampshire-Dell, 28, Camberley, Surrey\n\n\u2018Fun and fast to read\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s as if someone kidnapped Atwood and forced her to write a beach book \u2013 a thriller with easy-to-read narration and juicy cliffhangers. But I loved it! Fun and fast to read but darkly funny.\n\nRobyn Kemsley, 45, Jakarta", "description": "The sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale has wowed critics and been shortlisted for the Booker prize.
