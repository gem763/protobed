Israeli officials say a substantive part of the talks dealt with the American demand to curb investments from China.\n\nThe big picture: Earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met with Netanyahu and Israel's Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon in Jerusalem. In both meetings, Mnuchin demanded that Israel make good on its promise to form a monitoring mechanism for Chinese investments, Israeli officials tell me.\n\nAccording to the Israeli officials, Mnuchin raised concerns over Chinese investments in Israel's tech industry due to the fact that many Israeli companies are cooperating with U.S. companies or work in the American market.\n\nKahlon told Mnuchin that regulating Israel's tech industry could drive Israeli startups out of the country and badly damage the Israeli economy.\n\nBoth Netanyahu and Kahlon told Mnuchin they would pass a Cabinet decision on Chinese investments to address U.S. concerns.\n\nYes, but: The newly formed committee will only have an advisory role. Government regulators don't have to consult with the committee or accept its recommendations.\n\nThe committee will monitor Chinese investments in the areas of finance, communications, infrastructure, transportation and energy \u2014 but not in the tech industry.\n\nThe new committee will include representatives from Netanyahu's office, the Defense Ministry and the Finance Ministry \u2014 with each of the representatives having veto power on deals with China.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry, which pushed for accepting U.S. demands on the issue, will only have observer status.\n\nThe bottom line: It's still unclear if the new committee's mandate will satisfy the Trump administration, which demanded stronger restrictions on Chinese investments, especially in the tech industry.\n\nIsraeli officials tell me Netanyahu wanted to address U.S. concerns but was also worried that any decision would anger China and drive out Chinese investors completely.\n\nThe officials added that the Cabinet decision was a compromise between national security and relations with both the U.S. and China.\n\nGo deeper: Israel scrambles to avoid Trump blowback over Chinese investments", "description": "But it might not have the teeth the White House had hoped.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/ZH--iyvfCHwh_eili-aZpnm0cQA=/0x37:3000x1725/1920x1080/2019/10/30/1572455011475.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
