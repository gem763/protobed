Drake has finally reached out to Bianca Andreescu.\n\nThe US Open champion went viral earlier this week when she called out the Toronto rapper for not congratulating her on her title. Drake quickly realized the error of his ways and sent Andreescu a text.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually having a conversation with him, this is unreal,\u201d a delighted Andreescu said during a press conference Wednesday before reading off the following message from Champagne Papi himself. \u201cHe\u2019s like \u2018Here I am :) Congrats, we are all so proud of you. I\u2019ve been liking every post with you in it, lol I thought you\u2019d see.\u2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t [see], I was barely on social media, I was just posting things, but yeah, that was cool. I don\u2019t even know what to reply to that, it\u2019s going to take me a while.\u201d\n\nAfter Drake kept her waiting for days, it\u2019s probably fair for the Mississauga Ont., native to leave him on read for a bit.\n\nHere\u2019s what @Drake texted Bianca Andreescu. \u201cHere I am :) Congrats, we\u2019re all so proud of you...\u201d #ShetheNorth pic.twitter.com/Fzu7xKHmov \u2014 Kamil Karamali (@KamilKaramali) September 11, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s been a whirlwind summer for Andreescu, who won the Rogers Cup title on home soil before capturing her first grand slam over Serena Williams. Getting some recognition from one of Canada\u2019s biggest celebrities is a nice cherry on top.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the way the teenage phenom has been rocketing up the WTA rankings, this probably won\u2019t be the last time Drake sends her a congratulatory text. We\u2019re still holding out hope he brings Andreescu and the US Open trophy on stage at a concert in the near future.\n\nMore tennis coverage from Yahoo Sports", "description": "Drake and Bianca Andreescu have finally connected over text message.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6p7PkcnKxGNKoiUBwK0fSA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD02OTkuNzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Mih0SgJqu8qK8L_AA0xydg--~B/aD03Njg7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/97fb0e60-d4b6-11e9-8c7e-f8761b27f142"}
