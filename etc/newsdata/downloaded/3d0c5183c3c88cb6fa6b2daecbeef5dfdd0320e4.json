And they\u2019re angry\u2026", "language": "en", "text": "A spate of large-scale street protests around the world, from Chile and Hong Kong to Lebanon and Barcelona, is fuelling a search for common denominators and collective causes. Are we entering a new age of global revolution? Or is it foolish to try to link anger in India over the price of onions to pro-democracy demonstrations in Russia?\n\nEach country\u2019s protests differ in detail. But recent upheavals do appear to share one key factor: youth. In most cases, younger people are at the forefront of calls for change. The uprising that unexpectedly swept away Sudan\u2019s ancien regime this year was essentially generational in nature.\n\nIn one sense, this is unsurprising. Wordsworth expressed the eternal appeal of revolt for the young in The Prelude, a poem applauding the French Revolution. \u201cBliss was it in that dawn to be alive, But to be young was very Heaven!\u201d he declared. Wordsworth was 19 years old when the Bastille was stormed.\n\nYet while younger people, in any era, are predisposed to shake up the established order, extreme demographic, social and political imbalances are intensifying present-day pressures. It is as if the unprecedented environmental traumas experienced by the natural world are being matched by similarly exceptional stresses in human society.\n\nThere are more young people than ever before. About 41% of the global population of 7.7 billion is aged 24 or under. In Africa, 41% is under 15. In Asia and Latin America (where 65% of the world\u2019s people live), it\u2019s 25%. In developed countries, imbalances tilt the other way. While 16% of Europeans are under 15, about 18%, double the world average, are over 65.\n\nPerhaps these protests will merge into international revolt against injustice, inequality and oppressive powers-that-be.\n\nMost of these young people have reached, or will reach, adulthood in a world scarred by the 2008 financial crash. Recession, stagnant or falling living standards, and austerity programmes delivered from on high have shaped their experience. As a result, many current protests are rooted in shared grievances about economic inequality and jobs. In Tunisia, birthplace of the failed 2011 Arab spring, and more recently in neighbouring Algeria, street protests were led by unemployed young people and students angry about price and tax rises \u2013 and, more broadly, about broken reform promises. Chile and Iraq faced similar upheavals last week.\n\nThis global phenomenon of unfulfilled youthful aspirations is producing political timebombs. Each month in India, one million people turn 18 and can register to vote. In the Middle East and North Africa, an estimated 27 million youngsters will enter the workforce in the next five years. Any government, elected or not, that fails to provide jobs, decent wages and housing faces big trouble.\n\nNumbers aside, the younger generations have something else that their elders lacked: they\u2019re connected. More people than ever before have access to education. They are healthier. They appear less bound by social conventions and religion. They are mutually aware. And their expectations are higher.\n\nThat\u2019s because, thanks to social media, the ubiquity of English as a common tongue, and the internet\u2019s globalisation and democratisation of information, younger people from all backgrounds and locations are more open to alternative life choices, more attuned to \u201cuniversal\u201d rights and norms such as free speech or a living wage \u2013 and less prepared to accept their denial.\n\nPolitical unrest deriving from such rapid social evolution is everywhere. Lebanon\u2019s \u201cWhatsApp revolution\u201d is a perfect example. Yet some protests, such as those in Hong Kong and Catalonia, are overtly political from the very start.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anti-government demonstrators protest in Hong Kong.

But by taking on China\u2019s authoritarian regime, they have assumed pole position in a struggle against autocratic \u201cstrongman\u201d rulers everywhere. Their campaign has international resonance, which is why China\u2019s President Xi Jinping fears it.\n\nIt is difficult, if not perverse, to watch protesters risking torture and death by challenging Egypt\u2019s dictator, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and not relate their daring both to Hong Kong and, say, to Kashmiris\u2019 efforts to throw off the yoke imposed by another \u201cstrongman\u201d, India\u2019s Narendra Modi. When Palestinian youths taunt the Israel Defence Forces with flags and stones, are they not part of the same global fight for democratic self-determination, basic freedoms and human rights espoused by young Muscovites opposing Vladimir Putin\u2019s cruel kleptocracy?\n\nIn this sea of protest, a common factor is the increased willingness of undemocratic regimes, ruling elites and wealthy oligarchies to use force to crush threats to their power \u2013 while hypocritically condemning protester violence. Repression is often justified in the name of fighting terrorism, as in Hong Kong. Other culprits include Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Myanmar and Nicaragua.\n\nAnother negative is the perceived, growing readiness of democratically elected governments, notably in the US and Europe, to lie, manipulate and disinform. Distrust of politicians, and resulting public alienation, is the common ground on which stand France\u2019s \u201cgilets jaunes\u201d, Czech anti-corruption marchers and Extinction Rebellion. As William Hazlitt, the 18th-century essayist and celebrated mocker of Wordsworth might have said, disbelief is the new spirit of the age.\n\nPerhaps these protests will one day merge into a joined-up global revolt against injustice, inequality, environmental ruin and oppressive powers-that-be. Meanwhile, spare a thought for a different type of protest \u2013 the one you never hear about \u2013 and what that may entail. The stifling silence that hangs over North Korea\u2019s gulag, China\u2019s Xinjiang and Tibet regions, and dark, hidden places inside Syria, Eritrea, Iran and Azerbaijan could yet descend on us all. What helps protect us is the noisy, life-affirming dissent of the young.", "description": "From Hong Kong to Chile, young people are rising up to fight injustice and inequality.
