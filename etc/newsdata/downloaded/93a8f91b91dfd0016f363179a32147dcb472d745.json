Add Interest\n\nAs President Donald Trump faced criticism last week over a July phone call with Ukraine, which led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to advance the impeachment inquiry, the Trump campaign's Facebook ad spending ballooned. Trump's reelection team dropped a total of $1.1 million between Sept. 22-28, according to Facebook's political ad transparency reports.\n\nThe Trump team's aggressive anti-impeachment Facebook ad campaign dwarfs its total Facebook ad spending throughout the first three weeks of September, which was just over $640,000, according to digital firm ACRONYM\u2019s analysis of Facebook\u2019s ad data.\n\nThe increase in ad spending also comes on the heels of the end of the third fundraising quarter on Monday.\n\nTrump's ads featured messaging that echoes arguments made by the president and his allies to discredit the impeachment effort, while also fundraising off the president's latest perilous crisis.\n\nOne ad argues the impeachment push has \u201cnothing\u201d to do with the president but is instead a way for Democrats to silence and intimidate Trump voters. \u201cThey want to take YOUR VOTE away,\u201d reads one ad. Other ads launched familiar attacks against the president's 2020 Democratic rivals. \u201cThe BIG GOVERNMENT SOCIALISTS like Sleepy Joe, Crazy Bernie, and Pocahontas know they can\u2019t win,\u201d one ad reads.\n\n\u201cIf Democrats outraise us, they will be able to dominate the airwaves with their crazy IMPEACHMENT WITCH HUNT,\u201d another add reads.\n\nSince Democrats moved forward with an impeachment inquiry, the president has tweeted similar arguments against impeachment. \u201cThe Greatest Witch Hunt in the history of our Country!\u201d the president tweeted Monday.\n\nThe ads also ask supporters to donate to the campaign in order to join an \"Impeachment Defense Task Force\u201d -- a tactic that\u2019s helped the campaign and the Republican National Committee raise $15 million as of Sept. 27.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nLast Friday, the campaign announced a $10 million ad blitz pushing back on impeachment, $2 million of which is coming from the RNC. The RNC told ABC News that this ad is the committee\u2019s first television ad buy in eight years. Ads began airing Sunday in 25 to 50 House districts.\n\nThe latest ad buy trounces any TV ad purchase the campaign has done yet in 2019. So far, the Trump campaign has spent less than $300,000 on network and national cable television ads, according to ad firm CMAG\u2019s television ad data.", "description": "The Trump campaign is spending millions to push counter-messaging around impeachment, dropping more than $1 million on Facebook last week.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-4-gty-er-190930_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
