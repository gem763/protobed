They had not looked like losing one.\n\nYet on this incredible night in Yokohama they were given a rugby lesson by England, who bossed the game throughout to set up a final showdown next Saturday against either Wales or South Africa.\n\nEngland were on a \u00a31.2million team bonus to beat New Zealand for the first in World Cup history but this was not about money.\n\nIt was all about the glory.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFrom the moment Manu Tuilagi struck with a try after just 98 seconds a nation humiliated at the last World Cup on home soil tripped the light fantastic.\n\nEngland could even afford to have two tries controversially chalked off and still bring home the biggest scalp in quite unforgettable fashion. It was a defensive masterclass. No, it was more than that.\n\nNew Zealand had known they were in for a mighty battle the moment they set up for the Haka and saw England advance and adopt a horseshoe formation.\n\n\u201cChallenge accepted,\u201d the All Blacks twitter account noted, but they had seen nothing yet.\n\n(Image: MARK R CRISTINO/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nEngland kicked off and forced New Zealand to clear their lines. Elliot Daly picked up and ran it right, linking with Anthony Watson.\n\nThe ball was recycled and moved infield. First Kyle Sinckler then Courtney Lawes offloaded deliciously as white shirts ploughed forward.\n\nNew Zealand had never in World Cup history conceded a try inside the first two minutes. Tuilagi, with the final touch, changed all that.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nA pause for the shock to set in then the stadium erupted in noise. No time to get used to it though as England came again. And again.\n\nThey might have scored down the right, then they probably should have done up the middle after Tuilagi intercepted Beauden Barrett and offloaded to Jonny May.\n\nThe All Blacks held firm but they still could not get a foothold in the game as England reprised the start that had brought them a 15-0 lead when the sides last met, at Twickenham last November.\n\nThey ended up losing that one but Maro Itoje insisted that this was England\u2019s time. His formidable work at the breakdown and lineout certainly only lent weight to his argument.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nFor all their good work, their possession and territory, England could not add to their score.\n\nThey briefly thought they had when Sam Underhill went over on 25 minutes. But Tom Curry was adjudged to have obstructed the Kiwi defence with his decoy run and TMO Marius Jonker disallowed it on review - just as he had Underhill\u2019s \u2018winning\u2019 try against the All Blacks at Twickenham 11 months ago.\n\nAgain England refused to be downhearted. Even when Owen Farrell took a blow to the leg which briefly disabled them. And when Jones\u2019 men won a penalty just past halfway on the stroke of half-time Ford stepped up and nailed it.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nNew Zealand left the field and ran straight into a horrible stat. This was just the second time in more than 20 years they had been held scoreless in the first half in any Test.\n\nOf greater concern was the one queuing behind it, which showed that the last seven times the All Blacks had been held scoreless at the midpoint they had gone on to lose.\n\nSteve Hansen responded by subbing off flanker Scott Barrett for Scott Cane, England by returning to the field and to their now customary position on the New Zealand try line.\n\nIt was no surprise when six minutes into the new half Ben Youngs saw a gap round the side of a ruck and was over. England fans in the stadium went bonkers, at home the feeling was the same.\n\nBut again referee Nigel Owens hesitated and instead of awarding the try drew a box in the air. That invited TMO Jonker to the party and once again he played the role of killjoy.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nJust how he could rule that the alleged knock-on, off the floor inside a maul was \u2018clear and obvious\u2019, is a mystery. As such, he should have kept his nose out of it.\n\nTo their immense credit England took it on the chin again and came back for a penalty, which Ford converted.\n\nThat might have been that but at 13-0 England made their first real mistake of the match. Jamie George over threw to a lineout on his own line, the ball sailed north of Itoje\u2019s grasp, and Ardie Savea pounced at the tail to claim the softest of tries.\n\nBut England would not be denied. Not this group of men. Not on this night.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFord popped over two more penalties and there was nothing New Zealand could do other than watch the changing of the guard.\n\nENGLAND\n\nTry: Tuilagi.\n\nCon: Farrell.\n\nPen: Ford 4.\n\nNEW ZEALAND\n\nTry: Savea.\n\nCon: Mo\u2019unga.", "description": "ENGLAND 19-7 NEW ZEALAND: Eddie Jones' men hand New Zealand their first World Cup loss since 2007 in convincing style", "authors": ["Alex Spink", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Mark R Cristino Epa-Efe Rex", "Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728739.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_TOPSHOT-RUGBYU-WC-2019-MATCH45-ENG-NZL.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
