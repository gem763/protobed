But by late afternoon, they were down as much as 38.9 per cent.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Trading in the second half has started slowly, not helped by the unseasonably warm weather in September, and this will have an impact on the full-year outcome. If these trends continue, we will achieve a second-half result below that of last year.\u201d\n\nTed Baker, which has 560 stores and concessions around the world, spent \u00a311.8m improving its Asian businesses and \u00a33.5m on its footwear division.\n\nIt also announced a new partnership with Next in the UK to sell some of its ranges, following the administration of Debenhams.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
