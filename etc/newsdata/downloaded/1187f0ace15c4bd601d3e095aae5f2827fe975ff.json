(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nThe suggestion that 'the server' is being hidden in some Ukrainian warehouse is straight-up bonkers.\n\nThe impeachment drama is already a three-ring circus, with a full complement of clowns to the left and the right.\n\nBut if you\u2019ve ever been to a three-ring circus, you know that it\u2019s hard to take it all in at once.\n\nI want to focus on one detail that hasn\u2019t gotten enough attention: the \u201cmissing\u201d DNC server that the president believes might be in Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019ve paid any attention to the impeachment drama, you know the basics. The center-ring story is that President Trump allegedly tried to pressure Volodymyr Zelensky, the new president of Ukraine (by withholding military aid and an Oval Office meeting) to investigate former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nIn his now-infamous phone call with Zelensky, Trump asked for a \u201cfavor\u201d in two parts. The second part, which everyone focuses on, was the request for the Ukrainians to work with Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr in an investigation of Biden and Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first part of the favor is far less controversial. Trump asked Zelensky to look into the status of the DNC email server that the FBI and former special prosecutor Robert Mueller say was hacked by the Russians ahead of the 2016 election. Remember, this is the same Mueller whom the president cites for his \u201ctotal exoneration\u201d from the Russian collusion allegation.\n\nAccording to the rough transcript released by the White House, Trump said, \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike . . . I guess you have one of your wealthy people . . . The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis favor is less controversial because Trump\u2019s defenders don\u2019t controvert it. It\u2019s central to their defense. They concede Trump asked for this favor, contending that by the time Trump got to the \u201cother thing\u201d he wanted from Zelensky \u2014 an investigation of Biden \u2014 he was no longer asking for a \u201cfavor\u201d at all. Trump would never ask for a quid pro quo to smear a political opponent, they insist. But asking for an investigation into the server? That\u2019s entirely appropriate. After all, there\u2019s an official investigation into how the FBI launched its Russia/Trump probe in the first place. Asking for help with that is wholly legitimate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s disastrous press conference last week, he admitted there was an attempted quid pro quo with Ukraine. (\u201cGet over it,\u201d he exclaimed.) But in Mulvaney\u2019s version of events, it didn\u2019t have anything to do with Biden. It did, however, have to do with \u201cthe corruption related to the DNC server.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: This is nuts.\n\nThere\u2019s a conspiracy theory, popular in the Oval Office and the swampier corners of the Internet, that the hacking of the DNC\u2019s email servers wasn\u2019t orchestrated by Russia but by Ukraine \u2014 to benefit Hillary Clinton!\n\nThis makes no sense for countless reasons we don\u2019t have space for. But it\u2019s worth noting that in the most popular version of this story, the DNC hack was an inside job, conducted by a low-level staffer named Seth Rich, who was then murdered to keep him from exposing the plot to frame the Russians.\n\nCrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, was hired to analyze the server \u2014 which was actually more than 140 different servers. Rather than take possession of the server(s), CrowdStrike made digital copies of the whole shebang. This was allegedly a cover-up. As Trump tweeted in 2018, \u201cWhere is the DNC Server, and why didn\u2019t the FBI take possession of it? Deep State?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt gets loopier. As Trump suggested in his call with Zelensky, the theory is that CrowdStrike is a Ukrainian-owned or Ukrainian-connected company. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s based in California, and the alleged Ukrainian co-founder of the company was born in Russia. The suggestion that \u201cthe server\u201d is being hidden in some Ukrainian warehouse, like the Ark of the Covenant at the end of the first Indiana Jones movie, is straight-up bonkers.\n\nIn the words of Trump\u2019s former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, this \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d has \u201cno validity\u201d and \u201chas been completely debunked.\u201d\n\nReasonable people can disagree on what to make of all this. But when you hear Trump defenders talk about the \u201ccorruption related to the DNC server\u201d as a way to deflect from the troubling allegation about the Biden investigation, it makes as much sense as saying \u201cthe corruption related to Jimmy Hoffa\u2019s body in Ukraine\u201d or \u201cthe corruption related to the atomic rabbit prowling the sewers of Kiev.\u201d And that should be troubling, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00a9 2019 Tribune Content Agency LLC", "description": "The suggestion that \u201cthe server\u201d is being hidden in some Ukrainian warehouse is straight-up bonkers.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Ilya Shapiro", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Kevin D.
