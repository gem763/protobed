Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe second-seeded Spaniard was in cruise control as he took the first set behind some superb serving and stout defence but the big-hitting Croatian battled back to snatch the second.\n\nThat was as good as it would get for Cilic, however, the momentum shifting decisively in Nadal\u2019s favour when he jumped in the air to hit a spectacular overhead smash that electrified the crowd.\n\nCilic would double fault later in the game to give Nadal a 3-1 lead and he would never threaten again on a hot and humid night in New York, with Tiger Woods among the star-studded crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium cheering on the Spaniard.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot to me to have him supporting,\u201d said Nadal.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an amazing inspiration, all the things that he accomplish in sport, the way that he managed to keep fighting that hard.\u201d\n\nNadal fired a forehand winner on match point to seal the victory and make his 40th quarter-final at a Grand Slam event.\n\n\u201cFor some moments in the second set I felt there was too many points in his hands,\u201d said Nadal.\n\n\u201cHe was pushing me back ... after (the) second set I thought something needed to change.\u201d\n\nThe 33-year-old has had a relatively stress-free time at the tournament so far, dropping just one set and getting a walkover in the second round.\n\nNext up for the 18-time Grand Slam champion is a meeting with Argentine Diego Schwartzman, who toppled Alexander Zverev in their round of 16 clash earlier in the day.\n\nThe diminutive Argentine has faced Nadal seven times and lost every meeting but has proven a difficult test in the slams, forcing the Spaniard to go four tough sets at the 2018 Australian and French Opens.\n\n\u201cHe is one of the most talented players on our tour,\u201d said Nadal, who sometimes trains with Schwartzman. \u201cHe has everything, amazing control, amazing speed.\n\n\u201cHe has the ability to read very well your shots and to understand very well the game. Is not a surprise he is there.\n\n\u201cI know people can think that Zverev was favoured before that match. Honestly for me, today, Schwartzman was favoured.\n\n\u201cI saw him play a couple of matches during this tournament, he was playing great.\n\n\u201cI need to play my best in the next round to have the chance to be in that semi-finals.\u201d\n\nNadal is on a collision course with third seed Roger Federer and could meet his old rival in Sunday\u2019s final if both players advance. Federer faces Grigor Dimitrov in the quarters on Tuesday.", "description": "Rafa Nadal faced his stiffest challenge yet at the U.S. Open but raised his game to beat Marin Cilic 6-3 3-6 6-1 6-2 on Monday and continue his quest for a fourth Flushing Meadows title.", "authors": ["Rory Carroll", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425672048&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF820J3-OZASP"}
