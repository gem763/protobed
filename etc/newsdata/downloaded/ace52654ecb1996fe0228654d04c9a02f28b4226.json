Tells Us What Love Smells Like", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Courtesy of Tiffany & Co.\n\nScientific studies confirm that, of all the senses, smell offers the best recall. In Scent Memories, the Cut asks people about the scents they associate with different times in their lives.\n\nNext up is Reed Krakoff, designer and chief artistic officer of Tiffany & Co. Today, the iconic brand launched two new fragrances: Tiffany & Love for Him and Tiffany & Love for Her, complementary scents that are a tribute to today\u2019s modern love in its different forms. The launch marks the brand\u2019s first step into dual fragrances and comes with a campaign shot by photographer Cass Bird, and a video scored by Mark Ronson featuring King Princess and a Turtles cover. While each scent each has its own vibe, (For Him is more masculine and citrus-y, For Her, more feminine and floral) both are united with a common, woody note, the blue sequoia. We caught up with the designer to talk sheets, figs, and scents that help you get work done.\n\nMy first scent memory is: Cut grass and old books.\n\nThe scent that inspires me when I\u2019m designing is: Vetiver. It\u2019s funny, I\u2019m very narrow on what I like. If I\u2019m wearing any scent at all, it\u2019s always that. It\u2019s something that\u2019s refined and has a natural kind of sensibility to it, but it\u2019s still complex.\n\nMasculinity and femininity smell like: I don\u2019t think of a specific person when I design anything; I think more of an attitude and sensibility. Femininity and masculinity mean different things to different people, so these fragrances are more of a broad suggestion. It\u2019s so personal, fragrance. People have different interpretations, even of the same notes.\n\nModern love smells like: Similarly, a personal thing; a more intimate thing. I don\u2019t really have a scent for it because I don\u2019t really wear fragrance. I don\u2019t wear any jewelry or anything, nothing. Most people I know who work in design don\u2019t. It\u2019s a clean palette. I have a uniform, I wear the same thing every day. You can\u2019t wear the same thing four days in a row, because then people just think you don\u2019t change. But five days in a row; then they know it\u2019s a uniform. Five days, you know it\u2019s purposeful. I literally have 30 of the same shirt, two different ones. Twenty pairs of jeans. For 25 years I\u2019ve had the same uniform. It\u2019s very liberating, once you do it.\n\nHappiness smells: Effervescent and clean. To me, it\u2019s always an outdoor thing. Maybe because growing up, I was outdoors a lot. But it\u2019s always this sunny cut grass, salt air, dry effervescent warmth. A spring day kind of feeling, and the smells of the earth. Nothing too sweet, nothing too heavy, nothing too citrus-y, and nothing too formal.\n\nSuccess smells like: Something calm, like a sense of calm accomplishment.\n\nMy work space smells like: Occasionally candles, but they\u2019re always white fig, freesia, or cut grass. They help keep you focused on what you\u2019re doing.\n\nMonday morning smells like: Clean sheets. Like clean, crisp linen.\n\nIf I could have one smell on your hands forever, it would be: My wife. What else would it be? Chocolate? [laughs] Some people would say that, right?\n\nTiffany & Love For Him Eau de Toilette $95 at Bloomingdale\u2019s Buy\n\nTiffany & Love For Her Eau de Parfum $135 at Bloomingdale\u2019s Buy\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "Designer Reed Krakoff, chief artistic officer of Tiffany & Co., tells us about the iconic brand\u2019s new fragrances, Tiffany & Love for Her and Tiffany & Love For Him, and shares his favorite scents.", "authors": ["Erica Smith"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/30/30-scent-memories-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
