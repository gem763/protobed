Every bit of the project mapped out and in this plastic tub,\" Downey said. \"I sat on the floor and almost cried [because] I knew I had to buy and finish it but\u2026 it was a massive f---ing undertaking.\"\n\nDowney said that she embroiders, she doesn't quilt. But she bought the project nevertheless, did some research, and discovered that the creator's name was Rita, and that she died aged 99 in August.\n\n\"Now I really had to finish this thing,\" Downey wrote. So she turned to the community of crafters on Instagram.\n\nThe project has turned into a viral sensation, with people using #RitasQuilt to track progress\n\nMore than 1,000 people volunteered, she said, but she chose 100 to embroider the hexagons Rita had left behind \u2014 50 for each state, and another 50 to each stitch a star. She mailed out 100 packages, and has recruited more than 30 Chicago-based quilters to help put the project together once her volunteers turn in their hexagons.\n\nThe project has turned into a viral sensation, with people using the hashtag #RitasQuilt to keep up with the project's progress.\n\nBut even split up 100 ways, the project is no mean feat. Several of the crafters told The Washington Post that they expected their hexagons to take hours to finish \u2014 the woman embroidering her home state of Maine said she expects it to take 20 hours, while the woman working on Alabama said it'll likely take between five and 10 hours.\n\nDowney said her followers had even dug through genealogy records to learn more about Rita, discovering she was a Canadian immigrant who became a nurse, and even finding her son, who is still alive.\n\n\"I spoke to her son and he was telling me that she was a ferocious crafter and would do upholstery, crochet, stitching... sort of everything,\" Downey told CNN. \"Eventually, she stopped to take care of her ailing husband.\"\n\nDowney has estimated that the project should be completed around late January, and she hopes to have it displayed in a quilting museum, where the public can see it.", "description": "Shannon Downey wrote on Twitter that she often visits estate sales and buys unfinished embroidery projects.
