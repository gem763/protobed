I'm sorry.\"\n\nAs Munchetty began her next question, he removed this earpiece and walked off the set.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nMunchetty smoothly concluded the interview without reacting to his premature cutting off of their conversation.\n\nTwitter reactions to Proctor walking off the screen were mixed.\n\nOne viewer wrote: \"Harvey Proctor not too keen to allow a balanced debate there. Accusing Naga of talking across him when he was not letting her get a word in edgeways whilst making quite serious allegations! #bbcbreakfast \".\n\n\"Kicking off because he wasn\u2019t allowed to say what he wanted to say?\n\n\"I do wish she\u2019d asked him about the findings of the search on his property - or why the MET settled with the others but not him.\n\n\"Now that would be newsworthy\", added another.\n\n\"A very difficult and understandingly emotionally charged interview with Harvey Proctor.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\"Very well managed by Naga and very respectful and sympathetic comments made after Mr Proctor felt he couldn\u2019t continue. Powerful piece\", said a third.\n\nBut others disagreed, with another viewer writing: \"Oops Harvey Proctor walks out on interview with Naga Munchetty on @BBCBreakfast Got to say Naga could have handled it with more sensitivity.\n\n\"He is elderly, been through a nightmare at the hands of incompetent police, which she admitted at the end\".\n\n\" @BBCBreakfast you just got owned by Harvey proctor.\n\n\"Maybe Naga will learn to stop talking over everyone all the time\", added another.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nProctor was falsely accused by fantasist Carl Beech of committing historic sex abuse in a VIP paedophile ring.\n\nThis led to police searching the homes of three wrongly accused people, including Harvey, with warrants that were later found to have been \"obtained unlawfully\".\n\nThe Met police spent a total on \u00a32.5 million on the bungled case.\n\nBeech, 51, was jailed for 18 years for these false allegations.\n\nProctor was calling for Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson to resign for promoting the false claims.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nHe also argued that Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick should be brought on to the show to debate their handling of the case.\n\nProctor claims he received death threats and lost his home, job and reputation based on the accusations.\n\nMunchetty recently became the centre of a media storm over her comments on Donald Trump .\n\nThe BBC upheld a complaint against her for offering a personal view on the US president demanding a group of black and minority politicians \"go back\" to their own country.\n\nBut the broadcaster has since reversed its decision following a public outcry.", "description": "Harvey Proctor stormed out of a BBC Breakfast interview with Naga Munchetty which divided opinion on Twitter", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Bbc", "Pa", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20465731.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Naga-Munchetty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
