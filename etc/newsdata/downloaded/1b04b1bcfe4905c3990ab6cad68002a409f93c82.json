Authorities said the gunman used bump stocks to rain fire on concertgoers, killing more than 50 people.\n\nThe Justice Department has resisted releasing the number of bump stocks people have turned in to the federal government, saying it paints an incomplete picture of compliance with the ban.\n\nPeople could destroy the devices themselves or turn them in to other law enforcement agencies, ATF spokeswoman April Langwell said.\n\nAsked whether the numbers have increased or decreased in recent months, Ms. Langwell said, \u201cThe rule went into effect as of March 26th, so obviously April 4th was even a few days beyond the deadline.\u201d\n\nShe said the 98 devices that were held for \u201cevidence\u201d were turned over by people who said they wanted them back if the ban was successfully blocked in the courts.\n\nRW Arms, a Texas firearms company, made a public display of destroying more than 73,000 of the devices in March under the supervision of federal agents.\n\nThe Washington State Patrol reported in late March that about 1,000 bump stocks were turned in as part of a local buyback program before funds were exhausted.\n\nStill, the 582 number suggests many people are simply choosing to hoard their devices, said Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a significant feeling of \u2018will not comply\u2019 with gun confiscation-type laws on one hand, and on the other hand quite honestly, most gun owners probably don\u2019t know that you were supposed to turn them in or destroy them and so they\u2019re just keeping them anyway,\u201d Mr. Gottlieb said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve traveled around the country since this was put into effect, and I don\u2019t know anybody that had one that turned one in,\u201d he said.\n\nGun rights advocates suggested in the run-up to the March 26 deadline that owners hold on to the devices as legal challenges to the rule played out in the courts. The U.S. Supreme Court turned aside several of those challenges near the time the ban took effect.\n\nThe ban could be seen as something of a smaller-scale \u201ctrial run\u201d for what the federal government would have to do under a mandatory ban and buyback of certain military-style, semi-automatic firearms along the lines of what Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke is advocating, said Robert Spitzer, a professor at SUNY Cortland.\n\n\u201cI think it does have some implications for that,\u201d said Mr. Spitzer, who has written extensively on the politics of gun control. \u201cOn its face, it\u2019s not clear how any kind of mandatory program would work.\u201d\n\nMr. Gottlieb agreed.\n\n\u201cIt telegraphs, quite frankly, that if a Beto O\u2019Rourke-type confiscation scheme ever got passed, that at best they\u2019d have a fractional percent of people actually turning them in,\u201d he said.\n\nErich Pratt, senior vice president of Gun Owners of America, predicted that the compliance rate would be even worse if the government ever bans actual firearms, rather than accessories such as bump stocks.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s ban will not garner one vote from the anti-gun left but may work to lose supporters from his base,\u201d Mr. Pratt said. \u201cThe big danger, as we argue in our lawsuit which is now in the 6th Circuit Court, is that this ban opens the door to banning all semi-automatic rifles.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, though they supported a ban on the devices, warned that Congress should pass legislation and that a new administrative rule could get tied up in the courts.\n\nThe administration ruled that bump stocks effectively operated as machine guns, though the ATF ruled during the Obama and George W. Bush administrations that they were not machine guns and therefore fell outside the bounds of what the Justice Department could unilaterally regulate.\n\n\u201cWe kind of did this quickly, sort of by executive fiat, and this is the sort of problem that you would think might crop up when you do that,\u201d said Charles Rose, dean of the Ohio Northern University Pettit College of Law. \u201cThe truthful answer is we just don\u2019t know how many bump stocks were turned in or how many bump stocks were destroyed, and that\u2019s because of the way we went about saying that they were no longer legal.\u201d\n\nHe said law enforcement has largely been at the mercy of bump stock owners acting in good faith.\n\n\u201cAnd the problem with that is that the people who possess them who will follow the new law as it\u2019s interpreted are probably not the folks that you were worried about to begin with,\u201d he said.\n\nLast month, a Houston man was accused of illegal possession of a bump stock in what authorities believe to be the first known federal prosecution of such a charge since the ban went into effect in March.\n\n\u201cATF should continue to publicize the change in law and prosecute where appropriate,\u201d said Andrew Zucker, a spokesman for the group Everytown for Gun Safety.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
