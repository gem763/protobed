(Photo: Ramon Espinosa/AP)\n\nHurricane Dorian technically diminished to Category 2 storm status Tuesday as it slowly turned to the northwest, but the historic and violent storm was growing in size as it punished the Bahamas and inched toward the U.S.\n\nThe latest forecasts put the hurricane farther off Florida\u2019s east coast than previous projections. Still, forecasters said some coastal areas from Florida to North Carolina could see 4 to 10 inches of rain in coming days. Or worse.\n\n\u201cWe still have hurricane warnings up because it\u2019s just too close to call,\u201d said Ken Graham, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. \u201cAny little wiggle, wobble and it could get really close to the coast.\u201d\n\nIn the Bahamas, at least five people have died and thousands of homes are in ruins, Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said. The U.S. Coast Guard was assisting in rescue operations, he said. Relief and rapid assessment teams were standing by and will be deployed as soon as possible, Minnis added.\n\nThe center of the storm, which had completely stalled overnight, was crawling along at about 2 mph Tuesday. The storm was about 45 miles north of Freeport on Grand Bahama Island, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe storm has barely budged since Monday afternoon, triggering severe flooding as parts of the country face the prospects of up to 30 inches of rain. Wind speeds lessened slightly but still roared at 110 mph, with gusts of 140 mph. A storm surge of up to 15 feet was swamping neighborhoods.(AP)\n\nPHOTOS: Florida prepares for Hurricane Dorian \u00bb\n\nSee more news-related photo galleries and follow us on Yahoo News Photo Twitter and Tumblr.\n\nJulia Aylen wades through waist deep water carrying her pet dog as she is rescued from her flooded home during Hurricane Dorian in Freeport, Bahamas, Sept. 3, 2019.
