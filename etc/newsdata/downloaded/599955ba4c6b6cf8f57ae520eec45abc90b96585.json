Okay, not exactly, but in a recent New York Times interview, Edward Norton waxes more than a little nostalgic about his untimely exit from the Marvel cinematic universe following 2008\u2019s The Incredible Hulk, where upon he was replaced by Mark Ruffalo. According to Norton, he pitched two gritty Incredible Hulk films that the studio claimed to love, and boy, they would have been good.\n\n\u201c[W]hat Chris Nolan had done with Batman was going down a path that I aligned with: long, dark and serious,\u201d the actor explained. \u201cIf there was ever a thing that I thought had that in it, it was the Hulk. It\u2019s literally the Promethean myth. I laid out a two-film thing: the origin and then the idea of Hulk as the conscious dreamer, the guy who can handle the trip. And they were like, \u2018That\u2019s what we want!\u2019 As it turned out, that wasn\u2019t what they wanted.\u201d\n\nFollowing Norton\u2019s replacement, Marvel\u2019s Kevin Feige famously issued a statement that suggested it was Norton himself who caused the casting change, publicly announcing the studio\u2019s \u201cneed for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members.\u201d See also: Hulkgate.\n\nSays the actor now of Feige\u2019s \u201ccheap\u201d shot, \u201cIt was brand defensiveness or something. Ultimately they weren\u2019t going for long, dark, and serious. But it doesn\u2019t matter. We had positive discussions about going on with the films, and we looked at the amount of time that would\u2019ve taken, and I wasn\u2019t going to do that.\u201d Also, if Edward Norton can keep it real with you for a second: \u201cI honestly would\u2019ve wanted more money than they\u2019d have wanted to pay me.\u201d\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re tempted to Hulk out on the actor\u2019s behalf, save yourself the price of a new pair of purple cut-offs. He\u2019s over it. \u201cI went and did all the other things I wanted to do, and what Kevin Feige has done is probably one of the best executions of a business plan in the history of the entertainment industry,\u201d Norton concludes. Sounds like there\u2019s only one person left to weigh in at this point.
