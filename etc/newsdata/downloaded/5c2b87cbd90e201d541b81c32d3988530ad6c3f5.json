That pushed up food prices in China by 11.2% in September, accelerating from the previous month's 10% gain.\n\nOverall, China's consumer price index increased 3% year-on-year in September, while producer price index fell by 1.2%, according to Reuters. Economists polled by the news agency had expected consumer prices in China to increase by 2.9% in September, and producer prices to fall by 1.2%.\n\nChina is the world's top producer and consumer of pork. But as much as half of the country's hog population was estimated to have died from the protracted swine fever outbreak, which was discovered more than a year ago. China's pig herd could halve by the end of this year, according to a July forecast by analysts at Dutch bank Rabobank.\n\nChinese authorities have responded with measures such as consolidating pig farms and releasing pork from its strategic reserves, noted analysts from consultancy Capital Economics.\n\n\"But there are few signs that these measures have been effective: pigs continue to die in large numbers and pork price inflation is accelerating,\" the analysts wrote in a report last week.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Weizhen Tan contributed to this report.", "description": "China is the world's top producer and consumer of pork.
