TikTok is mostly home to irreverent, often incredibly bizarre videos, but this one was different from the lip-sync videos Sullivan usually posts \u2014 instead, she wanted to talk about her school district\u2019s failure to give its teachers adequate raises, and call on her peers to support her in a general strike in solidarity with staff.\n\n\u201cHi, this video is for kids who are in Clark County School District,\u201d Sullivan opens, flashing a purple-acrylic-topped peace sign with her fingers, and zooming in on her face \u2014 the TikTok equivalent of italics. \u201cSo if you\u2019re not in CCSD, keep scrolling.\u201d\n\nThese kids on tiktok are organizing a general strike in solidarity with their teachers? Holy shit? pic.twitter.com/h1Rny03xwc \u2014 Klaudia Amen\u00e1bar \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf1 (@kaludiasays) August 27, 2019\n\n\u201cSo, our district is refusing to give teachers who spent the past three years earning enough credits out of their [zoom] own pockets, spending extra hours outside of school to earn credits to get a raise. And our district [zoom out; then in again] won\u2019t give it to them. Like, literally, they won\u2019t pay the teachers what the teachers earned.\u201d\n\nWhen she first posted it, she figured it would get 100 likes, maybe, possibly six or seven comments. That\u2019s what some of her most popular TikToks have gotten so far. Instead, it went viral, racking up over 36,000 likes on TikTok, and 47,000 on Twitter.\n\nThe Foothill High School student uploaded the video last week, after her mom, who\u2019s been a teacher with Nevada\u2019s Clark County School District (CCSD) for over 20 years, told her daughter that the district had denied her a professional-development raise even after she went back to school to earn it. Sullivan\u2019s mother and her fellow CCSD teachers were considering staging a walkout on September 10. Sullivan did her own research on the matter and got upset over what she saw as the school district being \u201cmorally unjust.\u201d So she posted her TikTok the next day, venting her frustrations, and calling on her fellow students to strike on September 5, in solidarity with the teachers. (She chose a different day than the teacher\u2019s strike so the district wouldn\u2019t think students didn\u2019t show up to school because there were no teachers around.)\n\n\u201cIt was just a moment of passion. I just said what was on my mind. I really didn\u2019t expect it to get as popular as it did.\u201d she told the Cut over the phone.\n\nCCSD students are not the first to support their teachers striking. Students also joined picket lines during teacher strikes in West Virginia and Los Angeles earlier this year. But Sullivan and her peers are the first to organize on TikTok, a social media video app originally intended to upload short lip-sync videos, but that, like most social media apps, has evolved to include its own ecosystem. (Previous TikTok trends have included videos of people throwing a slice of cheese in someone\u2019s face to the sound of the Village People\u2019s \u201cYMCA,\u201d creating elaborate paintings that say \u201cThe birds work for the bourgeoisie,\u201d and discovering Peppa Pig in unexpected places.)\n\nSullivan said her mom, who used to make fun of her for how much time she spent on TikTok, was happy with how much positive attention the video has gotten, especially since, as Sullivan says, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of kids who go viral and get popular on TikTok for things that aren\u2019t positive.\u201d\n\n\u201cA couple of people have said I just want a ditch day, and a couple of others have said, \u2018Well, my district is worse,\u2019 or \u2018My district is just as bad,\u2019\u201d she went on. She added forcefully, \u201cIf I wanted a ditch day, I would just stay home. I wouldn\u2019t post anything on TikTok. And I\u2019m not stopping anyone from any other school district from striking, too. Nothing\u2019s stopping them.\u201d\n\nShortly before Sullivan and I spoke on Wednesday night, the CCSD and the Clark County Education Association, the teachers\u2019 union, held a joint-press conference announcing that they had struck a deal to avoid the September 10 strike. The deal includes a 3 percent raise for employees in the bargaining unit, a 4 percent increase in CCSD\u2019s contribution to health insurance, and column advancement for employees like Sullivan\u2019s mom, who complete professional-development courses.\n\nThe students\u2019 strike is also canceled for now, Sullivan says. But, she noted the next day, if the district \u201ccreates issues\u201d or tries to short-change teachers in the future, \u201cI\u2019m prepared to speak out and stand behind teachers again.\u201d\n\nSullivan\u2019s video and the response to it likely has less to do with TikTok itself and more with the generation that\u2019s using it. About a quarter of its users are under 24. And as Gen Z has repeatedly shown, it is not only technologically savvy; it is politically engaged.\n\n\u201cI think my generation realizes that we have a voice, and none of us are really afraid to use it,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cThe best thing I can say about my generation is that I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot that we fear.\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
