The Astros beat New York 4-1 on Tuesday to take a 2-1 series lead.\n\nThe winner will face Washington and its well-rested, talented rotation starting in the AL city on Tuesday night.\n\nWith New York relying so heavily on its relievers this month, the starter-driven Astros may be at an advantage.\n\n\"If we're going to win this series, our bullpen will still play a huge role, obviously,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. \"But we've got to be able to get a little bit of distance out of our starters.\"\n\nWATCH | Cole dominant again in Astros' win over Yankees:\n\nHouston defeats New York 4-1, leads ALCS 2-1. Gerrit Cole earns 19th straight decision. 1:47\n\nHouston will pitch Zack Greinke on Thursday at 8:08 p.m. ET against the Yankees' Masahiro Tanaka in a rematch of Game 1, both on regular rest. Tanaka pitched six sterling innings as New York won 7-0.\n\nThe Astros also announced that Justin Verlander will start Game 5 on full rest. He threw two-run ball into the seventh inning in a 3-2, 11-inning victory in Game 2 on Sunday.\n\nBullpen day for Yankees in Game 6?\n\n\"It was an easy decision,\" Astros manager AJ Hinch said.\n\nNew York plans to counter with James Paxton. The left-hander was pulled after allowing a run over 2 1/3 rocky innings in Game 2, and concerns were raised that he was tipping his pitches.\n\nWe'd like to see us have a more disciplined approach, but that's easier said than done with the stuff he has. \u2014 Astros manager A.J. Hinch on Yankees right-hander Masahiro Tanaka\n\nBoth clubs had planned to use openers Wednesday, and New York will almost certainly still use a bullpen day in the series, probably in Game 6. Boone has ridden his relievers hard, asking them to cover 15 1/3 out of 28 innings in the series \u2014 a tough enough task with October's built-in days off. The rainout leaves Aroldis Chapman, Zack Britton and the rest of that group without some valuable recovery time.\n\nTanaka has been New York's best bet for length this post-season. He needed just 68 pitches to cover six innings in the opener, improving to 5-2 with a 1.32 earned-run average in the post-season.\n\nGreinke in funk\n\n\"Anytime the moment gets really big, he is good at slowing the game down himself and maybe taking even a little bit off of his pitches as opposed to powering through it,\" Hinch said. \"We'd like to see us have a more disciplined approach, but that's easier said than done with the stuff he has.\"\n\nGreinke, a 2009 Cy Young Award winner acquired from Arizona at the July 31 trade deadline, has struggled through two starts this post-season. He allowed six runs and couldn't finish the fourth inning against Tampa Bay in Game 3 of the AL Division Series, and the Yankees hammered two homers and scored three runs against him in six innings in the ALCS opener.\n\nThe Astros may also lean heavily on relievers in Game 6, if necessary, although their bullpen strategy will differ from New York's. While the Yankees probably wouldn't ask any one pitcher for more than two or three innings, Houston could stretch starter Jose Urquidy over four or five innings after an opener. That could keep the rest of the club's arms fresher during this four-day run.\n\n\"How beneficial it is is probably easier to answer after I see how guys perform and how the pitching plays out,\" Hinch said of the rainout. \"But like I said, it's kind of a wait and see.\"\n\nThe previous post-season game to be postponed was Game 4 of the 2017 NL Division Series between the Nationals and Cubs.\n\nStanton's status\n\nBoone remained uncertain Wednesday if slugger Giancarlo Stanton would return to the lineup in Game 4. Stanton was held out of Games 2 and 3 after straining his right quad in the opener.\n\nStanton was set to receive treatment. Boone said he was available to pinch hit Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm not really close to making that decision yet,\" Boone said. \"That will be something that we kind of work through today and possibly even into tomorrow.\"\n\nBoone said it was likely that Aaron Hicks will be in the lineup regardless. The centre-fielder made his first start Tuesday since Aug. 3 due to an elbow injury and went 0 for 2 with two walks.\n\nBoone also doubled down on his vote of confidence for struggling catcher Gary Sanchez, who is 2-for-21 this post-season. Sanchez was booed and criticized Tuesday when he couldn't block a wild fastball from Britton, allowing a run to score.\n\n\"He's been excellent behind the plate from a game-calling standpoint, from a game-plan target, receiving,\" Boone said. \"A lot of people are making a lot of the block. There's a lot of 94 mile-per-hour fastballs that guys don't block. Guys aren't always set up to block a fastball. That's kind of a 50/50 play.\"", "description": "Game 4 of the American League Championship Series scheduled for Wednesday night was postponed a day because of poor weather, with Game 5 pushed to Friday night at Yankee Stadium and Games 6 and 7 in Houston on Saturday and Sunday, if necessary.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5322800.1571242389!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/astros-yankees-alcs-baseball.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
