But even before anything goes astray, putting our faith in the Lord is a great way to get the assurance we need to press onward.

There's so much we don't know about how our lives are going to turn out, but God does know, and He can guide us forward on our journeys if we have faith in Him.\n\nMost of the scripture around trusting the Lord comes in the Psalms section of the Old Testament. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, this section is comprised of lyrical poems and songs. They're often short and memorable, allowing their meaning to stick in our heads all day like any other song might. Hopefully these verses about trusting God do the same, allowing us to have God's word in mind through both the good days and the bad.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AySDjBLrmt7lcRz67Zrt4Q--~B/aD0xNDE0O3c9MjExOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/woman_s_day_132/4aa222f524676fa37513a1c60fbb4d54", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
