We joined our two amazing families, had countless laughs, made wonderful friends and were blessed with incredible opportunities.\n\n\u2018Today we take our next step together, but on separate paths. We will always be grateful for the love we\u2019ve shared and will always work together to raise our two beautiful dogs.\u2019\n\nThe amicable message added: \u2018We will be taking time to rediscover ourselves in this transition and we thank you for your patience and support in giving us the space to do so.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristina and Geoffrey were introduced to each other by her Mad Men co-star Vincent Kartheiser who played Pete Campbell on the hit series.\n\nThe pair did not have children during their marriage and Christina, 46, once recalled how she was praised for being honest about her lack of desire to become a mother.\n\nSpeaking to The Times in 2014, the actress said: \u2018There were a lot of people who came and thanked me for saying it out loud, and I thought, \u201cWell isn\u2019t it sad, that we can\u2019t say it out loud?\u201d\n\n\u2018I really don\u2019t understand the hullabaloo around it. There\u2019s people who have kids and people who don\u2019t have kids. We\u2019re the people who don\u2019t have kids.\u2019\n\nPraising Geoffrey for sharing a similar viewpoint on children, Christina continued: \u2018We\u2019ll celebrate eight years of marriage in October.\n\nThe pair just marked their 10th wedding anniversary (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve been together for almost 10. [It] does not feel that long at all. I just know him so well. I\u2019ve never known anyone that well in my life\u2026 He understands me and listens to my c**p and still somehow loves me and I\u2019m grateful for that.\u2019\n\nHowever in 2012, Christina revealed what happened when they first met and joked to Geoffrey that she wanted to have his children.\n\n\u2018Geoffrey walked in and I was like, \u201cWho is this guy?\u201d He had amazing hair and was all dishevelled \u2013 he was running late and everyone was waiting for him. He just came in with this very high energy,\u2019 the Good Girls actress told Cosmopolitan UK at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He was just charming, funny and very magnetic. I got his number that night under the pretence of, \u201cWe could just be friends.\u201d And of course I immediately went home and Googled him.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018I cracked it out in such a big way. I was like, \u201cYou make me want to have a family.\u201d I freaked him out a bit\u2026Thank God I didn\u2019t spook him enough to make him leave.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
