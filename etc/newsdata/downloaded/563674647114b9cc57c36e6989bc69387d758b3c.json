REUTERS/Philip Brown/File Photo\n\nThe retired England batsman was convicted in France in 1998 of hitting his ex-girlfriend; on Tuesday he was unrepentant over the incident, saying that the allegations were untrue and that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t give a toss\u201d about the criticism.\n\nThe opposition Labour party and campaigners called for Boycott\u2019s nomination to be rescinded.\n\n\u201cCelebrating a man who was convicted for assaulting his partner sends a dangerous message \u2013 that domestic abuse is not taken seriously as a crime,\u201d Adina Claire of the charity Women\u2019s Aid said in a statement.\n\nBoycott, interviewed on Tuesday after the honour was announced, was irritable when asked about the conviction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cross I have to bear \u2013 right or wrong, good or bad, I have to live with it \u2013 and I do because I am clear in my mind, and I think most people in England are, that it\u2019s not true,\u201d Boycott, 78, told BBC radio.\n\nWhen asked about the charity\u2019s criticism, he replied to the female presenter: \u201cI don\u2019t care a toss about her, love. It\u2019s 25 years ago. You can take your political nature and do what ever you want with it ... I couldn\u2019t give a toss.\u201d\n\nBoycott is set to receive a knighthood after previously expressing his frustration with not getting the honour in terms that also attracted criticism.\n\nIn 2017, Boycott apologised \u201cunreservedly\u201d after the Daily Mirror reported that he had said he needed to black up to improve his chances of getting a knighthood given how many West Indian cricketers had received the honour. Boycott said he meant no offence but \u201cwhat I said was clearly wrong\u201d.\n\nQueen Elizabeth grants Resignation Honours at the request of an outgoing prime minister. May nominated Boycott, whose persistence she had vowed to emulate in her ultimately failed efforts to deliver Brexit, among a list of other people.\n\nBoycott scored over 8,000 runs in test cricket and was known for his stubborn and conservative batting style.\n\n\u201cOne of my cricket heroes was always Geoffrey Boycott,\u201d she said in November when quizzed about how long she would stay in office as ministers quit in protest at her strategy for pulling Britain out of the European Union.\n\n\u201cGeoffrey Boycott stuck to it and he got the runs in the end,\u201d said May, who ended up leaving the job in July after repeatedly failing to get her Brexit deal approved by parliament.\n\nRETCHING FEELING\n\nMay previously mocked her predecessor David Cameron\u2019s decision to knight his communications director Craig Oliver, implying that seeing his name on Cameron\u2019s resignation honours list had given her a retching feeling.\n\nHowever, the former Conservative leader has also chosen to honour some of her closest advisers and allies, with her Director of Communications Robbie Gibb, chief Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins, European adviser Peter Storr and de facto deputy David Lidington all receiving knighthoods.\n\nMay\u2019s former joint chiefs of staff, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy, the latter an architect of May\u2019s approach to Brexit who has been outspoken in criticising his old boss\u2019s strategy since he stopped working for her, are in line for lesser honours. Their replacement, Gavin Barwell, has been nominated to sit in Britain\u2019s upper chamber, the House of Lords.\n\nAsked about May\u2019s choices for honours, new Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \u201cit is at the discretion of the former prime minister.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\n\u201cThat particular list - definitely a matter for her.\u201d\n\nKim Darroch, Britain\u2019s former ambassador to Washington who quit in July after a leak of his memos to a British newspaper prompted a stinging attack from U.S. President Donald Trump, has also been nominated to be made a Lord.\n\nAs well as Boycott, May nominated former England cricket captain Andrew Strauss for a knighthood, while Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick will receive a damehood.", "description": "Former British Prime Minister Theresa May has chosen Geoffrey Boycott, one of her cricket heroes, for a knighthood, attracting criticism from domestic abuse charities.", "authors": ["Alistair Smout", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428273439&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890PT", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
