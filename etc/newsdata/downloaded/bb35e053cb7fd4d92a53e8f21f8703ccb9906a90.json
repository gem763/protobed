Photo: Sean Rayford/Getty Images\n\nEveryone knows that Elizabeth Warren has proposals for making child care affordable, reducing carbon-dioxide emissions, improving corporate governance, bolstering organized labor, promoting economic development in rural America, combating corruption, and addressing myriad other policy challenges that our nation faces.\n\nBut surely the senator doesn\u2019t have a plan for everything. For example, imagine if America\u2019s dumbest far-right grifters libelously accused her of engaging in exceptionally violent S&M with a former U.S. marine turned gigolo. Which is to say, imagine if Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman decided that they weren\u2019t content with manufacturing bogus sexual-misconduct allegations against Robert Mueller and Pete Buttigieg, and paid some fellow idiot with a preposterously stupid name \u2014 for the sake of this thought experiment, let\u2019s say \u201cKelvin Whelly\u201d \u2014 to say that Warren hired him for \u201cnot just rough sex but extensive BDSM play,\u201d and that \u201calthough I had a lot of experience in the business, I was shocked by the intensity, duration, and sheer violence of what Senator Warren wanted.\u201d Imagine these allegations were all aired at a driveway press conference in front of this billboard:\n\noh no how will she ever come back from this pic.twitter.com/rw2vfjgXbX \u2014 John Ganz (@lionel_trolling) October 3, 2019\n\nDoes Warren have a plan for how she could slyly wink at such an absurd and unlikely spectacle \u2014 without dignifying it with a direct response \u2014 while somehow simultaneously plugging her plans for higher education and tying it all back to her own uplifting personal story?\n\nDoes she have a plan for that?\n\nIt's always a good day to be reminded that I got where I am because a great education was available for $50 a semester at the University of Houston (go Cougars!). We need to cancel student debt and make college free for everyone who wants it. pic.twitter.com/fHasLm0j9P \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 3, 2019", "description": "In a tweet Thursday, Elizabeth Warren owned Jacob Wohl, promoted free college, and stood up for thirsty cougars everywhere.
