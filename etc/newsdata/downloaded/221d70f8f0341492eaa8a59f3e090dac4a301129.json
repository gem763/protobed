It would be madness,\u201d said Ronan Lavery, lawyer for McCord, whose son was killed during the three decades of violence the peace deal largely ended.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted lawfully when he ordered the suspension of parliament for five weeks before Brexit, London's High Court ruled on Friday, but it allowed the the legal challenge to be taken to the Supreme Court.", "authors": ["Kate Holton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426891203&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850TM", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
