[We] urge other potential venues nationwide to consider the group\u2019s history of Islamophobia and associations with white supremacist and racist organizations.\u201d\n\nACT did not respond to a request for comment but in a statement to the Guardian Malkin attacked \u201ca chilling \u2018cancer culture\u2019 campaign being waged against patriotic journalists and activists \u2013 and apparently not even Mar-a-Lago is a safe space\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe SPLC and CAIR seek to silence and eliminate political opponents by redefining criticism of their agenda and tactics as \u2018hate\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nACT\u2019s website claims it is the nation\u2019s \u201clargest and most influential national security grassroots advocacy organization\u201d with more than a million members. Its mission statement asserts: \u201cAnyone who traffics in prejudice, or advocates violence in any way towards anyone does not speak on behalf of ACT for America.\u201d\n\nYet the SPLC has branded ACT \u201cthe largest anti-Muslim group in America,\u201d which organized a controversial and often violent nationwide series of Marches against Sharia in 2017 that attracted neo-Nazi and other extremist sympathizers.\n\nTrump made more than $22m from Mar-a-Lago in 2018, federal disclosures showed, raising ethics concerns. It represented a $3m drop in revenue from the previous year, but was still a healthy personal profit from a property the president likes to call his \u201csouthern White House\u201d.", "description": "ACT for America booked Trump\u2019s Palm Beach retreat for annual dinner, raising objections Trump was \u2018profiting from bigotry\u2019", "authors": ["Richard Luscombe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0df81668b18ef1f1f4ed3b6838a01ffaa48655d4/0_101_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c066c25452924728ee92ea53483a1467", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
