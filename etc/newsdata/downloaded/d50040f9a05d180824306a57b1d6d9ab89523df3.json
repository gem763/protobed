Elizabeth Warren asserted that only corporations and the wealthiest Americans will see their tax bills rise to pay for her boldest campaign promises \u2013 universal childcare, Medicare for All, and student debt cancellation. Hard-working middle-class families will be spared, she said.\n\nWarren is officially leading the 2020 race \u2013 she overtook Joe Biden in the latest Quinnipiac poll, though by a slim margin (30% vs. 27%) \u2013 and that\u2019s scary to big business, which she has long characterized as having oversize influence on the overall economy.\n\nSectors such as financials, health care, and tech have expressed particular concern at the prospect of a Warren presidency.\n\n\u201cI'm really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive,\u201d Warren said at Tuesday\u2019s debate.\n\n\u201cLook, I don't have a beef with billionaires. My problem is you made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou built that fortune in America. I guarantee you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You built it in part getting your goods to markets on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it at least in part protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay the salaries for. And all I'm saying is, you make it to the top, the top 0.1%, then pitch in two cents so every other kid in America has a chance to make it.\u201d\n\nConvincing the ultra-wealthy, big businesses and investors that paying a higher share of taxes is good for the country will take more than a well-timed soundbite from the debate stage.\n\nA Trump victory is viewed by most investors (61%) as good for stocks, according to a recent RBC Capital Markets survey. Two-thirds of respondents expect President Trump to get re-elected in 2020, but doubts are creeping in. A dwindling share of respondents think Trump will get re-elected, while a growing number think Warren will lead the Democratic ticket.\n\nWarren\u2019s ascent is making many investors nervous because they viewed a Biden 2020 win as a neutral event for markets. Their views on stocks and returns for portfolios turns negative should Warren or another Democratic candidate other than Biden be the victor; 89% of investors said electing a Democrat other than Biden would be bearish or very bearish for U.S. equities, according to RBC Capital Markets.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen.

Warren as her standing in the polling has risen. [Investors] playing a little bit of catch up on getting up to speed on her specific policy proposals,\u201d says Salisbury. Given that Warren\u2019s policies would be a significant departure from Trump\u2019s, investors are beginning to gauge what the risks and opportunities are.\n\nWhile the CEOs of America\u2019s biggest corporations have decried the negative impact of Trump\u2019s tariff policy on sales, hiring and capital investments, Warren has not advocated for a reprieve from the financial pain inflicted on corporate America. Rather, her plans could cut further into profit margins of corporations.\n\nWarren\u2019s plan to reform America\u2019s labor laws is a sharp departure from the status quo for chief executives \u2013 for instance, they would limit the amount of stock executives can sell in their own companies, while raising wages for workers and boosting unions\u2019 bargaining power.\n\nWarren has long sought to weaken big business and boost regulation as a way to protect consumers and workers, and her plans as presidential candidate would arguably do the most to overhaul the way businesses operate.", "description": "Why Wall Street fears Elizabeth Warren as she is shaping up to be the Democratic nominee", "authors": ["Sibile Marcellus"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zQNUYWbltD2rcogEpJKhxA--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/b2d201d0-efb4-11e9-befe-ae20a8d08b63", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
