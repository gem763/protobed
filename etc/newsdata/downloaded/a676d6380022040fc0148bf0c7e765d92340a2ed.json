After about a year of service, the rental company will typically pull the vehicle out of the fleet and sell it as a used car. But in this \u201csecond life,\u201d a former rental vehicle can make for a compelling used car value - if you\u2019re willing to accept a few trade-offs.\n\nEdmunds has researched the pros and cons of buying a rental vehicle. We\u2019ve also gathered a small list of vehicles to keep an eye out for that might prove to be a particularly good value. The choices are based on Edmunds\u2019 data and comparisons to traditional dealership pricing.\n\nPROS:\n\n- A way to save: Rental companies purchase their vehicles in volume and at a discounted rate. In turn, they are able to sell them at lower prices than a traditional dealership would. As seen in the examples below, discounts could be 10% or more.\n\n- A newer vehicle for less money: It is not uncommon to find 1- to 2-year-old vehicles, which could potentially get you the latest body style or safety features. These vehicles would cost thousands more at a franchise dealership\u2019s used car lot.\n\n- Convenient sale process: Avis, Enterprise and Hertz offer no-haggle pricing. Avis and Hertz also offer free two-hour test drives or a three-day \u201crent to buy\u201d program, which gives you more time to decide if you want the car. To alleviate buyer\u2019s remorse, Enterprise and Hertz also have seven-day return policies.\n\n- Well-maintained vehicles: Rental agencies are diligent about maintaining their vehicles. All the scheduled maintenance is performed at the manufacturer-recommended intervals.\n\n- Limited warranty: Most major rental companies will give buyers a 12-month or 12,000-mile limited powertrain warranty. This coverage is more than you\u2019d get at an independent used car lot, where most of the vehicles are sold as-is. At either place, you will inherit any remaining balance on the vehicle\u2019s factory warranty.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Uncertain history: It\u2019s difficult to determine how hard a rental car was driven. While some might be careful with a rental, others may drive the vehicle more aggressively since it isn\u2019t theirs.\n\n- Higher-mileage inventory: The average miles driven per year in the U.S. is about 14,000. But you\u2019ll easily find vehicles in a rental fleet with double or triple that number of miles.\n\n- Potential to be out of warranty: Because of the higher mileage, you might find that the vehicle is past its factory warranty coverage. Any repairs required will likely have to be paid out of pocket.\n\n- Lightly optioned cars: Don\u2019t expect to see top-of-the-line vehicles with a ton of upscale options. Rental companies usually buy base models due to the lower price and simplicity of ordering.\n\nVEHICLES TO CONSIDER\n\n- 2019 Volkswagen Jetta\n\nAverage sales price for rental models with 10,000-20,000 miles: $14,993\n\n(17.2% discount from a dealership)\n\nWhat our editors say: \u201cThe new Jetta offers a roomy cabin and an impressively smooth ride quality. Quick acceleration from a stop is another highlight.\u201d\n\n- 2017 Hyundai Accent SE\n\nAverage sales price for rental models with 40,000-50,000 miles: $10,401\n\n(12.2% discount from a dealership)\n\nWhat our editors say: \u201cThe Accent is a top choice for a small sedan thanks to a satisfying combination of performance, utility, comfort and style.\u201d\n\n- 2019 Kia Optima LX\n\nAverage sales price for rental models with 20,000-30,000 miles: $15,052\n\n(12.1% discount from a dealership)\n\nWhat our editors say: \u201cThe Kia Optima continues to offer some of the most feature-packed models you can buy in the midsize sedan segment.\u201d\n\n- 2018 Nissan Rogue S\n\nAverage sales price for rental models with 40,000-50,000 miles: $15,766\n\n(12% discount from a dealership)\n\nWhat our editors say: \u201cThe Rogue has an expansive cargo space and roomy seating. It\u2019s one of the more versatile small SUVs around.\u201d\n\n- 2018 Toyota Avalon\n\nAverage sales price for rental models with 30,000-40,000 miles: $19,061\n\n(9.9% discount from a dealership)\n\nWhat our editors say: \u201cA cushioned ride and hushed cabin make the Avalon well-suited for commutes and road trips, and its roomy interior offers plenty of room to spread out.\u201d\n\nEDMUNDS SAYS: Consider shopping at a rental car lot the next time you\u2019re in need of a good used car. The streamlined sales process and lower prices may be enough to offset the added miles and history of many drivers.\n\n___\n\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.
