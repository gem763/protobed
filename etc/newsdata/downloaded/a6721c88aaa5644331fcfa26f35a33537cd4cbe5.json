REUTERS/Phil Noble/Files\n\nWith 23 days before the United Kingdom is due to leave the bloc, there is no sign the impasse between London and Brussels could be bridged and both sides are jostling to avoid blame for a delay or a disorderly no-deal Brexit.\n\nBritain\u2019s proposals to replace the Irish \u201cbackstop\u201d - an insurance policy to keep the border open between the Republic of Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland - has been rebuffed by EU leaders.\n\nThe pound tumbled on Tuesday after a Downing Street source said German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had spoken and that she had made clear a deal was \u201coverwhelmingly unlikely\u201d.\n\nThe source said that if the call represented a new position, it meant a deal was impossible \u201cnot just now but ever\u201d.\n\nEuropean Council President Tusk accused Johnson of playing \u201csome stupid blame game\u201d.\n\nBy 1215 GMT, the pound was down 0.5% at $1.2226, having earlier threatened to fall below the $1.22 mark. It weakened more than 0.7% against the euro, touching a low of 89.95 pence - its weakest since Sept. 9 GBP=D3 EURGBP=D3.\n\n\u201cThe pound has taken a lurch lower as (reports say) there is no prospect of a deal,\u201d said Michael Hewson, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.\n\nBut he noted that a law passed last month by parliament requires Johnson to seek a delay to Brexit if a deal with the EU has not been agreed by Oct. 19.\n\n\u201c(Sterling) is reacting to the newsflow, which is negative. But at some point it has to react to the reality, which is that there will be an extension and elections,\u201d Hewson added.\n\nThe opposition Labour party called for lawmakers in parliament to unite to prevent a no-deal Brexit taking place at the end of October.\n\nAnalysts say a Brexit delay leading to a UK election has already been priced in as the most probable outcome.\n\nThere are also signs that markets are not overly perturbed by the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. While Johnson has repeatedly vowed to take Britain out of the EU on Oct. 31 even without a divorce deal in place, sterling-dollar implied volatility gauges maturing around the deadline were little affected by the pound\u2019s moves. GBP1MO=FN\n\nHowever, data has repeatedly highlighted the extent of potential damage from a no-deal Brexit. A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies published on Tuesday said leaving without a deal could double Britain\u2019s budget deficit to around 100 billion pounds ($123 billion).\n\nThe political jitters, and signs of economic deterioration fuelled a rally in British government bonds, with 10-year yields slipping almost 4 basis points to 0.41%, the lowest since early-September GB10YT=RR", "description": "Sterling touched a one-month low against the euro on Tuesday as investors took fright at reports that Brexit talks between Britain and the European Union were close to breaking down.", "authors": ["Olga Cotaga", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438371254&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970GZ", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
