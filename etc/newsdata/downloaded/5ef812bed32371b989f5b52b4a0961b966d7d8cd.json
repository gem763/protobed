While the loan was ostensibly for research and conservation purposes, it was generally regarded as an act of friendship by China, which has sent pandas to many countries.\n\nThe two pandas proved a huge hit with Thais. For three years, a dedicated 24-hour TV channel broadcast their daily lives.\n\nA scheme to encourage Chuang Chuang to mate by showing him videos of pandas getting intimate made headlines in 2007. The couple did produce a baby, Lin Ping, in 2009, though this was done through artificial insemination.\n\nThe zoo said around 15 million visitors have come to see the panda family in the past 16 years, generating 295 million baht (about $10 million) in income.\n\nIt may take some time until the cause of Chuang Chuang\u2019s death is known.\n\nUnder an agreement between the zoo and the Chinese government\u2019s panda conservation project, an autopsy cannot be performed until a Chinese expert is present.\n\nThe zoo is organizing commemorative activities for Chuang Chuang, and all staff have been ordered to wear black or white clothing for a period of mourning.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Zoo staff in northern Thailand donned black and white clothing and observed a minute of silence Tuesday to mourn the sudden death of their popular male giant panda, who was on a long-term loan from China.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Busaba Sivasomboon", "Jerry Harmer"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/thailand_panda_death_05749_c0-623-1864-1709_s1770x1032.jpg?ab7a6f386aff72481b73248e633f5ea2728cd2e0", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
