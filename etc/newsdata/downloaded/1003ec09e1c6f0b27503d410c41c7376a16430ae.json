He arrived on Capitol Hill Friday morning for a briefing behind closed doors in the basement of the Capitol.\n\nThe meeting kicked off another day of fast-moving developments in the House impeachment investigation into allegations that Mr. Trump and his administration worked to bend America's diplomatic apparatus for his own benefit, trying to pressure Ukraine\u2019s government to help dig up dirt on his political rivals.\n\nIn addition to speaking with Mr. Atkinson, lawmakers were expected to subpoena the White House for a vast trove of documents related to the Ukraine matter, and hinted at other requests. A significant subpoena deadline for the State Department to hand over similar material in its possession was also scheduled to arrive by the end of the day.", "description": "Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community who first brought to Congress the complaint that spurred the impeachment inquiry, is meeting privately with lawmakers.", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/us/politics/04dc-impeach/04dc-impeach-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
