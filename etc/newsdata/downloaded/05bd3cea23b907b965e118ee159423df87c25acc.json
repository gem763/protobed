The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.\n\n\n\nAt its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran\u2019s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were lifted in January 2016, reconnecting Iran to global markets.\n\nThe six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with Iran were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council\u2019s five permanent members \u2013 China, France, Russia, the UK and the US \u2013 and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.\n\nOn 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.\n\nSaeed Kamali Dehghan, Iran correspondent\n\n\n\n\n\nBritish officials are relatively certain from intelligence assessments that the oil was offloaded on to smaller boats.\n\nBritish marines seized Grace 1 in July after it entered Gibraltarian waters, claiming the oil was destined for Assad and Syria in breach of EU economic sanctions.\n\nThe Foreign Office says Iranian officials gave as many as five different assurances to British officials \u2013 including one in writing to Gibraltar\u2019s government \u2013 that the ship\u2019s cargo would not go to Syria.\n\n\u201cIran repeatedly gave assurances to the government of Gibraltar that the Grace 1/Adrian Darya 1 would not deliver oil to any EU-sanctioned entity in Syria or elsewhere. It is now clear that Iran has breached these assurances and that the oil has been transferred to Syria and Assad\u2019s murderous regime,\u201d the Foreign Office said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s actions represent an unacceptable violation of international norms and the UK will raise the issue at the United Nations later this month.\u201d\n\nRaab said: \u201cIran has shown complete disregard for its own assurances over Adrian Darya 1. This sale of oil to Assad\u2019s brutal regime is part of a pattern of behaviour by the government of Iran designed to disrupt regional security.\n\n\u201cThis includes illegally supplying weapons to Houthi insurgents in Yemen, support for Hezbollah terrorists and most recently its attempts to hijack commercial ships passing through the Gulf.\n\n\u201cWe want Iran to come in from the cold, but the only way to do that is to keep its word and comply with the rules-based international system.\u201d\n\nThe UK insisted the tanker was seized only in pursuit of EU sanctions policy, and not in support of the US effort to cut off Iranian oil exports, a strategy with which the UK does not agree.\n\nBritain is pursuing a policy of maximum economic pressure on Iran in an attempt to force Tehran to renegotiate the joint comprehensive plan of action, a deal on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme signed in 2015.", "description": "Foreign Office says Tehran breaching assurances with sale to \u2018Assad\u2019s murderous regime\u2019The Adrian Darya 1, pictured late last month, was photographed off the Syrian coast last week.
