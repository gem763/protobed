My instincts failed me.\u201d\n\nPowell, 75, laments that no intelligence officials had the \u201ccourage\u201d to warn that he was given false information that Iraq had such weapons during preparations for his February 2003 speech before the U.S. invasion the following month. Regrets are sprinkled through \u201cIt Worked For Me,\u201d along with lessons gleaned from a career that carried him from foxholes in Vietnam to senior positions at the Pentagon and the State Department.\n\nIn uncorrected page proofs of the book scheduled to be published May 22 and written with Tony Koltz, Powell advises on the virtues of kindness for a leader and a balanced life that shuns an obsession with work. He recommends taking care of and getting to know the \u201ctroops,\u201d citing State Department garage attendants he paid a surprise visit and impromptu chats with employees.\n\nPowell, born in New York City to Jamaican immigrants, served as secretary of state from 2001 to 2005, after 35 years in the military. A four-star general, he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1989 to 1993. A Republican, Powell endorsed Democrat Barack Obama\u2019s campaign for president in 2008.\n\nPowell is now a strategic adviser to Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital firm based in Menlo Park, California, that backed Zynga Inc. and Groupon Inc.\n\n\u2018Cheap Clock Radio\u2019\n\nPowell, who travels giving paid motivational speeches, offers indirect advice to hoteliers with his preferences as a frequent traveler: \u201cPlease give me a cheap clock radio; not one that needs printed instructions and plays my iPod. Please, oh please, don\u2019t get fancy shower controls with handles that give you no clue how to turn it, push it, or pull it on and off. I only need one showerhead, not a sprinkler system.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the quirks of fame, Powell recounts receiving portraits given to him by world leaders over the years.\n\nThe depictions were a \u201cnear-sure giveaway of where they came from,\u201d Powell writes in the book from News Corp.\u2019s HarperCollins. The \u201cone from Romania kind of makes me into Dracula.\u201d\n\nReagan\u2019s Gaze\n\nPowell, who served as national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan, recalls a morning in 1988 when he went to see Reagan and described a problem that needed to be solved that day. Reagan gazed past him at squirrels picking up nuts he had put out for them in the morning by the Rose Garden.\n\nIt was a lesson in delegating authority and trusting his team to make the right decision, Powell says. \u201cThe president was teaching me: \u2018Colin, I love you and I will sit here as long as you want me to, listening to your problem. Let me know when you have a problem that I have to solve,\u2019\u201d Powell writes.\n\nSobering Lessons\n\nPowell lists among the top accomplishments of former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration that \u201cwe got rid of the horrific Hussein\u201d regime in Iraq and ousted the Taliban from power in Afghanistan. Still, he says \u201cthere would have been no war\u201d in Iraq if Bush and his advisers had known that country\u2019s regime had no weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing worse than a leader believing he has accurate information when folks who know he doesn\u2019t don\u2019t tell him that he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Powell writes in a chapter entitled, \u201cTell Me What You Know.\u201d\n\nPowell\u2019s UN speech, part of the Bush administration\u2019s public case for the U.S. invasion of Iraq, with its unsupported assertions of mobile Iraqi biological-warfare labs and a \u201csinister nexus\u201d between Iraq and al-Qaeda terrorists, was based on \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d evidence, Powell writes.\n\n\u201cSo why did no one stand up and speak out during the intense hours we worked on the speech?\u201d Powell writes. \u201cSome of these same analysts later wrote books claiming they were shocked that I have relied on such deeply flawed evidence.\u201d\n\nPowell, who has quarreled over policy for years with former Vice President Dick Cheney, writes that Cheney had his chief of staff, Lewis \u201cScooter\u201d Libby, make the case for Iraq having weapons of mass destruction \u201cas a lawyer\u2019s brief and not as an intelligence estimate.\u201d\n\n\u2018Get Over Failure\u2019\n\nBecause Libby\u2019s material was \u201cunusable,\u201d Powell writes, he enlisted the help of the Central Intelligence Agency to prepare for his UN speech. Powell didn\u2019t know that \u201cmuch of the evidence was wrong,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile Powell returns to Iraq repeatedly in the book, he advises leaders to \u201ctry to get over failure quickly. Learn from it. Study how you contributed to it. If you are responsible, own up to it.\u201d\n\nBush wanted to keep lower-level officials and workers in Iraq who had the education, skills and training needed to run the nation even though he wanted the U.S. to dissolve the ruling Baath party after Saddam Hussein\u2019s fall, Powell writes.\n\n\u201cThe plan that the president had approved was not implemented,\u201d Powell says. Instead, he writes, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Bremer, who headed the Coalition Provisional Authority, eliminated all the officials and institutions \u201cwe should have been building on, and left thousands of the most highly skilled people in the country jobless and angry -- prime recruits for insurgency.\u201d\n\n\u2018Pottery Barn Rule\u2019\n\nPowell says that violated the leadership lesson that has become known as his \u201cPottery Barn Rule.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you break it, you own it,\u201d Powell said in cautioning Bush about the consequences of invading Iraq and its aftermath.\n\n\u201cIt was shorthand for the profound reality that if we take out another country\u2019s government by force, we instantly become the new government, responsible for governing the country and for the security of its people until we can turn all that over to a new, stable and functioning government,\u201d he writes. \u201cFor me the rule is all about personal responsibility; when you are in charge you have to take charge. The rule has nothing to do with Pottery Barn or any other store.\u201d\n\nThe media dubbed it the \u201cPottery Barn Rule,\u201d which Powell says made the home-furnishings retailer owned by Williams-Sonoma Inc. unhappy because it had no such policy.\n\n\u201cTruth to tell, I wasn\u2019t sorry,\u201d he writes.\u201cPottery Barn got spectacular publicity out of their non-policy.\u201d", "description": "Colin Powell Says Iraq Blot Shows Leaders Must Be Skeptical", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsmax.com/app_themes/newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxfblogo.gif", "published_at": "2012-05-03"}
