Earlier, the consortium that oversees production of parmesan said US consumers could expect to pay US$5 per kilogramme more for the hard Italian cheese.\n\nIn the jargon of trade negotiations, cheese is what is sometimes referred to as an \"offensive\" product for the European Union (EU) - one it has a particular interest in selling and thus one that is particularly vulnerable to punitive tariffs.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nWhile sales of dairy products account for less than 5 per cent of EU agri-food exports to the US market, the symbolic importance of European cheeses has made them a target for trade officials seeking to make a point while limiting the hurt to American consumers.\n\nHigh-profile products like parmesan or various kinds of blue veined cheeses have been targeted periodically over the years in trade disputes between the US and Europe.\n\nThe EU exports 133,000 tonnes of cheese to the US every year, according to figures from the European Dairy Association (EDA). Most are what it called \"'typical' European cheeses with unique characteristics\" with particular importance for the regions where they are traditionally produced.\n\n\"It's an enormous market for us. It's our No.1 cheese market outside the EU,\" said Benoit Rouyer, economist at French dairy industry body CNIEL. \"Even for premium products, it creates a problem of accessibility. Our ambition is to reach the broadest possible population in the US, our cheeses are not intended for an elite.\"\n\nMost high-quality cheese can take several months to mature, meaning the immediate impact on producers may not be felt immediately and some may find new markets.\n\nThe US Trade Representative's office told the industry it will not offer a grace period for goods still in transit when the tariffs take effect on Oct 18, the Cheese Importers Association of America said.\n\nFor cheese ready for sale, exporters face a choice of imposing higher prices or accepting a cut themselves.\n\n\"But as 25 per cent is not an insignificant amount, that will be hard to do,\" said David Swales, head of strategic insight at the UK Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board.\n\nWith a final list of what products will be hit not due until Oct 18, the industry was still seeking details. But parmesan and pecorino sheep's cheese from Italy, English cheddar and stilton, as well as emmentaler, gruyere varieties are all likely to be affected.\n\nOther well-known varieties, including French blue-veined roquefort and two Dutch artisanal cheeses - gouda Holland and edam Holland \u2013 were not on the list issued by US authorities.\n\nHowever, the EDA said it was concerned by discrepancies in treatment offered to different member states and said the whole EU area should be treated as a single bloc in WTO terms.\n\nIn broader terms, it said the sector was being made to pay for a battle in which it was not involved.\n\n\"Agri-food products and hence the farming community is now regularly taken as hostage in trade disputes, this is a development that is unacceptable,\" EDA General Secretary Alexander Anton said in a statement.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Consumer - [ROME] European cheese makers complained on Thursday of being held \"hostage\" in a transatlantic trade battle that had nothing to do with them after the US slapped 25 per cent tariffs on the sector in retaliation for state aid to aerospace group Airbus. .
