I used the cream-colored crayons and not the dark ones because I just didn't see that in books. I didn't think we belonged in books.'\n\n'I wrote this to give dark-skin kids a chance to live in the world of imagination and magic.'\n\n'Black Panther was a movie that was imaginative... it dealt with some really serious issues but in a fly and fun way and so that's when I had my ah-ha moment and I was like, 'Yes, this is the way I would like colorism to be experienced. I want for kids to love the book when their younger, and then grow up to understand it later.''", "description": "Lupita Nyong'o made the streets of New York her runway on Tuesday morning following her appearance on Good Morning America where she spoke about her new book.", "authors": ["Shelslaughter At Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/17/19750916-0-image-a-38_1571157141201.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
