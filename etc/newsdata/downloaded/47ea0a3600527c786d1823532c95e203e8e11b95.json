It calls for an election commitment to \u201cintegrate all private schools into the state sector\u201d, including withdrawal of their charitable status. It also wants to limit university admissions for private school students to the same proportion as that of the wider population.\n\nLast week the Daily Telegraph reported that Labour was looking at ending discounted business rates for independent schools, as well as imposing VAT on independent school fees, a policy Labour previously adopted in its 2017 election manifesto. According to a leaked document it estimated that applying VAT to school fees alone would raise about \u00a31.6bn.\n\nMike Buchanan, the executive director of the Headmasters\u2019 and Headmistresses\u2019 Conference (HMC), which represents the most prominent independent schools, said any proposals to abolish private schools \u201cwould tear apart the fabric of education\u201d in the UK.\n\n\u201cIndependent schools have played a vital role in the education system for generations and they are recognised around the world as beacons of excellence. We want to see all pupils getting the same opportunities by pushing up standards everywhere, not by destroying some of the best,\u201d he said.", "description": "Shadow chancellor says private schools \u2018don\u2019t need to exist\u2019 in a society with education equality", "authors": ["Richard Adams"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a515722d951448641ddfa4b9594943e3cfaef8a0/0_92_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b722c0639a5ca8d7b450fe677c064992", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
