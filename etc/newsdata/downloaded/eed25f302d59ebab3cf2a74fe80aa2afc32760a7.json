The contract with Ukraine concludes at the end of 2019 and it is unclear if negotiations to renew it will succeed.\n\nThe other item likely to be high on the agenda is a contract to upgrade Hungary's only nuclear power station, a project largely financed by a Russian line of credit.", "description": "The two leaders, who share a common disdain for western liberal values, have maintained and enhanced their special relationship over the years, even as the EU implemented sanctions against Moscow over Russia's annexation of Crimea.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/81/10/1000x563_cmsv2_85cd1f73-d627-53df-841e-663932c8d26d-4268110.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
