REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nAlmost two years after California began allowing sales of recreational cannabis, Lowell Farms: A Cannabis Cafe opened its doors in trendy West Hollywood, offering farm-to-table cuisine alongside vaping, joints, bongs and prepackaged edibles.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to be that flagship, that benchmark, to show people that a cannabis business isn\u2019t something that is scary,\u201d said general manager Kevin Brady.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that hasn\u2019t been legal for 120 years,\u201d he added of the restaurant venture, which is funded by cannabis farmers Lowell Herb Co, whose backers include the likes of pop star Miley Cyrus, actor Chris Rock and comedian Sarah Silverman.\n\nWhile the food served at Lowell Cafe will not be infused with cannabis, diners will be offered the services of a \u201cflower host\u201d who will advise how to pair different strains of marijuana with menu items and roll a joint at the table.\n\n\u201cEach day we will smell and taste the strains of the cannabis and offer pairings, much as you would do with wine pairings,\u201d said chef Andrea Drummer.\n\nCalifornians have been enjoying cannabis-infused food in private homes and at dinner parties since the state began allowing sales of recreational cannabis in January 2018. But Lowell Cafe is the first to open of eight cafes or restaurants that were awarded licenses by West Hollywood for public consumption, and the first in the United States.\n\nThe restaurant is aimed beyond Hollywood A-listers.\n\nNew Yorker Joy Alison Cohen, who was among the first customers on Tuesday, called the opening a \u201chistoric event.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to fly to Amsterdam to experience this. No more. We have better pot now too, so it is awesome,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe have families that are excited to come in and share it with their relatives and their grandparents. We have people that have reached out from Russia, Tokyo, Italy who want to plan their vacations to come here specifically for the cafe,\u201d said Brady.\n\nThe restaurant has an indoor and outdoor dining space and a high-tech air filtration system that managers say will scrub out the smoke and ensure that no diners go home high for free.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t feel like they are walking into a Korean barbecue or a funny stoner comedy,\u201d said Brady.", "description": "Hollywood's three-martini lunch may be going up in smoke with the opening on Tuesday of the first restaurant in the United States where weed can be openly consumed.", "authors": ["Jill Serjeant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1436022428&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF903IK"}
