Mr. Trump initially expressed interest in helping the Chinese government by deporting Mr. Guo, but other senior officials worked to block any such move, according to people familiar with the matter,\" WSJ reported.\n\nWhat's happening now: Kwok was very active on Twitter until suddenly going quiet in late November. Before his Twitter break, he tweeted about several meetings with Steve Bannon, and his pinned tweet shows him with Bannon.\n\nMy thought bubble: Drudge provides no further evidence beyond the tweet, but I have been hearing similar things. Given Bannon's apparent issues with donors, Kwok and Bannon's convergent views of the PRC, and their love of the spotlight, this could be an interesting partnership.
