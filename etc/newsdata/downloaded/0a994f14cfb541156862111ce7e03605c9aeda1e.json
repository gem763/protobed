How to Play It With Options.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nA trader works ahead of the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nLast week\u2019s unexpected rotation into value stocks, upended the market, especially as growth stocks, which had led the stock market higher for so long, suddenly turned rather unpopular. The violence of the move, which came amid growing concerns around growth and valuations, reportedly surprised some hedge funds, and many lost whatever gains they had this year. The weekend drone attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil fields has exacerbated the worries.\n\nStill, some investors are debating if the recent rotation was too extreme, and if fears of slowing economic growth are similarly a bit bombastic. After all, the European Central Bank just lowered interest rates, and the Federal Reserve is expected to follow on Wednesday. Plus, the economic growth outlook should benefit if the U.S. and China end the trade war, lifting one of the greatest market overhangs from the list of worries.\n\nTo pre-position for stocks to snap higher, and economic sentiment to improve, some investors are buying the out-of-favor iShares Russell 2000 exchange-traded fund (ticker: IWM). The fund is a play on lower rates, improving U.S. economic growth, and attractive upside options pricing. Call options on the IWM are relatively inexpensive compared with the S&P 500 Index.\n\nStuart Kaiser, UBS\u2019 derivatives strategist, told clients to consider buying IWM December $162 calls. He also likes buying the December $160 call and selling the December $170 call spread that entails buying the $160 call and selling the December $170 call. Both trades\u2014the outright call purchase and the spread\u2014cost about the same.\n\nWith IWM at $158.25, the December $162 call was trading at $3.87. The call is worth $8 if the fund is at $170 at expiration. Should IWM be below the strike price at expiration, the trade fails.\n\nThe call spread cost $3.89. If IWM Is at $170 at expiration, investors pocket $6.11\n\n\u201cWe see Russell 2000 as the most attractive upside if growth expectations improve and/or the move up the risk spectrum continues,\u201d Kaiser recently advised clients.\n\nIndeed, on Monday, when the stock market was broadly weaker, IWM traded with vigor, suggesting that investors are taking a trust, but verify stance.\n\nDuring the past 52 weeks, IWM has ranged from $125.81 to $171.82. Should IWM behave as expected, the fund will likely move into a newer, higher trading range.", "description": "To pre-position for stocks to snap higher, and economic sentiment to improve, some investors are buying the out-of-favor iShares Russell 2000 exchange-traded fund.
