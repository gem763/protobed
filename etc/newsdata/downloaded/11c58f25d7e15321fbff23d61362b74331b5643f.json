But there's more:\n\nVideo game company Activision Blizzard, which is partly owned by Chinese company Tencent, censored a professional player and rescinded his competition prize money after he expressed support for the Hong Kong protesters.\n\nThe Chinese government also banned (and virtually scrubbed from its domestic internet) the animated show \"South Park\" after its latest episode criticized the country's censorship.\n\nIt's no surprise that Hollywood is treading carefully around the Chinese government given its large market's importance to Hollywood.\n\nUpsetting the Chinese government can impact U.S. film exports. China has blocked or delayed films in the past. Most recently, it delayed the release of \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" which cut into revenues for Warner Bros.\n\nIn contrast: American companies have a history of bending to China's requests in the name of preserving their access to its market \u2014 but these usually related to censorship for Chinese customers, or other less visible requests.\n\nLast year, China forced Marriott and a number of airlines to explicitly list Taiwan, Macau and Hong Kong as part of China and not separate nations.\n\nEven Apple, which famously sparred with the FBI over consumer privacy rights, has yielded to Chinese requests such as removing VPN apps and certain news apps from its local app store.\n\nThe big picture: This is all happening against the backdrop of an ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China.\n\nAfter months of back-and-forth over tariffs, the U.S. announced on Monday that it was blacklisting 28 Chinese companies \u2014 including its top facial recognition startups\u2014 for their role in human rights violations. The firms won't be able to do business in the U.S.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. said it would impose visa restrictions on Chinese government officials who are believed to be involved in the mass detention and surveillance of Uighurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang province.\n\nWhat's next: Some are calling for U.S. regulators to reconsider TikTok parent company Bytedance's acquisition of Musical.ly, the American short-video app it acquired in 2017 from growing fears it will censor American users in accordance with its political speech preferences.", "description": "The NBA, \"South Park\" and a videogame all run afoul of Chinese authorities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/1O8IFLMEdN0e6uu3cgtY6SdGL2E=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/09/1570598909938.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
