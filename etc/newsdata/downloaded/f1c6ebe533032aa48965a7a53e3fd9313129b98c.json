In the settlement, he transferred his share of their town house \u2014 which still had mortgage on it \u2014 to his wife.\n\nHe agreed to pay the mortgage repayments in lieu of child maintenance for his youngest daughter. He paid the mortgage repayments for about a year when he realized his ex-wife had taken on a new partner and he was living with them.\n\nHe had a daughter, who is now 16 years, with his second partner. They bought a house together 10 years ago which has a mortgage. He put all his money toward the mortgage. He is now separating from his partner and they are selling the house.\n\nAlso see: My father suffers from dementia\u2014and my siblings forced him to sign a new will\n\nHe plans to nominate his youngest daughter as the sole beneficiary of his share (worth about $200,000) and also plans to leave her whatever assets he may have after death. His view is that the assets he has now have been generated in his second life and, therefore, must stay with the child from the second union.\n\nRecommended: My fianc\u00e9\u2019s father treats him like an ATM\u2014how do we protect our financial future?\n\nHe does not think that his three daughters from the first marriage are entitled to any inheritance from him as he gave up everything he had when he left them. Their mother, his ex-wife, still owns the house and gets rental income from it and, unfortunately, has not shared any money with her daughters.\n\nHe asked for my advice and I consider that he has already provided a lavish lifestyle for his daughter from his second relationship. She will inherit a substantial amount from her mother\u2019s share. I consider that whatever assets he ends up with should be shared between all four daughters. He thinks this is not fair.\n\nWhat do you think would be fair?\n\nA concerned friend\n\nDear Friend,\n\nIt seems like he has not seen his ex-wife or children in two decades. He can\u2019t buy that time back. They may not want anything from him. He is, of course, entitled to leave his money to whomever he wishes and, reading between the lines, appears to have a close relationship with his youngest daughter. So why not leave his $200,000 to his favorite?\n\nBecause he can do something in death that he, perhaps, didn\u2019t get a chance to do in life: recognize all four daughters and give them the respect and acknowledgment they deserve. Of course, this has very little to do with money. But a small portion of his estate could help his daughters with a down payment on a house or their education.\n\nAlso see: We plundered our 401(k) to invest in a friend\u2019s business \u2014 now we fear it\u2019s a Ponzi scheme\n\nHe should also talk to his ex-wife and ex-partner or, at the very least, correspond with them. They could come to a mutual arrangement to leave his four children a certain amount. That would give him more clarity to make sure that his children receive an adequate amount after he and their respective mothers have gone.\n\nI once received a letter from a mother about her two daughters. Their father had passed away. But he had sexually abused her two daughters and they didn\u2019t want any inheritance. They were admirably selfless. Again, that was their choice, but I advised her to think again. It could help their education or they could give the money to a charity of their choice.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: My fianc\u00e9 wants to take care of me financially, but I would have to leave my kids\n\nSo I will leave you with this quote from Sherwin Nuland, the late author of \u201cHow We Die,\u201d which I gave another letter writer whose father wanted to cut two of his daughters out of his will: \u201cGetting old is hard and dying ain\u2019t pretty,\u201d he told NPR. \u201cWhat gives dignity to death is the dignity of the life that preceded it.\u201d I love that quote. It speaks to so many issues of inheritance and lives lived with resentment and bitterness.\n\nWith a will, we all have one last chance to make amends and to make a statement that is bigger than any of the missed opportunities or broken relationships during our lifetime. We spend so much time wondering how we would like to be remembered when we are trying to make our mark with our work, friends and family. But we should spend just as much time thinking about how we would like to remember others.\n\nWhatever your friend does, I hope that he at least remembers that.\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?
