I think there's a huge amount of buyer's remorse in the country,\u201d Power told Yahoo Finance\u2019s Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer as part of a wide-ranging interview.\n\nSamantha Power speaks to Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer. More\n\nPower made the comments on Tuesday during a conversation that aired in an episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.\n\nHer comments on Brexit come amid a slew of challenges to the exit strategy of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a Brexit proponent who has threatened to leave the EU without a formal deal.\n\n\u2018My Irish ... soul here is at stake\u2019\n\nA major part of Brexit negotiations has been the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK and was beset by civil war-like violence for decades starting in the 1960s. \u201cThe Troubles,\u201d as Northern Ireland\u2019s years of turmoil were known, finally came to an end in 1998 under a deal known as the Good Friday Agreement, which aims to prevent checkpoints from going up at that border.\n\nIn his Brexit negotiations, Johnson has been accused of trying to violate the Good Friday Agreement. Power, who grew up in Dublin, said an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland is crucial for maintaining peace.\n\n\u201cMy Irish ... soul here is at stake because the one place it can't end up is with a hard border ... There are still a lot of very unresolved issues,\u201d Power said. \u201cAnd the one thing that has kept the peace intact has been just the commonality, people getting to know each other again, crossing from north to south as if you're crossing from New York to Newark. And that's how it has to remain.\u201d\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson gestures as he speaks during the Convention of the North at the Magna Centre in Rotherham, Britain September 13, 2019. Christopher Furlong/Pool via REUTERS More\n\nEU officials have expressed their desire to uphold the Good Friday Agreement, while accusing Johnson of reneging on it. \u201cThe commitment to all aspects and all the provisions of the letter and spirit of the Good Friday agreement recently seems to be taken more lightly than before,\u201d a senior diplomat from an EU member state recently told the Guardian. \u201cThis avoidance of the hard border, it is not just a desire, it is not just about preferences, it is legal obligation.\u201d\n\nIn her interview with Serwer, Power commended the EU for \u201cstanding firm and having the back of Ireland, which of course, has benefited enormously from being part of the EU, both in terms of the peace and in terms of the economy.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Johnson said that he \u201cwon\u2019t be deterred\u201d from exiting the EU, even if he does not get an official deal stipulating the terms of the separation. But Power said this week that a so-called no-deal Brexit would be disastrous for Britain.\n\n\u201cI don't think that a no-deal Brexit is something that you know anywhere near a quorum of parliamentarians or even a plurality of Britons would support. I mean, the economic consequences for that country would be so dire,\u201d she said.", "description": "While 52% of British citizens voted for Brexit in June 2016, former ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power believes some of them regret their decision.", "authors": ["Erin Fuchs", "Deputy Managing Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lAmlZ4PrMJ7hTShiTKYwGQ--~B/aD0zMzM4O3c9NTAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/362975f0-d62d-11e9-9f33-84db931cc872", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
