For the 100th time, land isn\u2019t alive and doesn\u2019t vote.\n\nBy now, this criticism of electoral maps is taught in elementary schools. Or, at least, it should be. Those red counties in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming, for example, are home to 1.6 million 2016 voters \u2014 fewer than half of the number of voters in Los Angeles County. Trump won 1 million votes in those states, beating Hillary Clinton by a 580,000-vote margin. In Los Angeles, Clinton beat Trump by 1.7 million votes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet those four states are 83 times the size of Los Angeles County in area. And, therefore, they occupy 83 times as much space on the map as L.A., despite being the home of half as many voters.\n\nTrump has done this before, so we\u2019ve written about it before. In August 2017, I made this graphic, showing how the votes in Washington, D.C., compared to votes in Roberts County, Tex., where Trump had his largest percentage-point margin of victory.\n\nOn Trump\u2019s map, Roberts County is a larger red block and Washington a smaller blue one.\n\nThe best map to illustrate the distinction here comes from XKCD.\n\nAll that red in the middle is better represented by a few scattered people.\n\nAD\n\nTrump presumably knows this by now. He\u2019s just making a broader point (while trolling his opponents): Look how much support I have!\n\n2. Maybe Trump doesn\u2019t want to go by actual votes for some reason.\n\nThis is the point: The map doesn\u2019t show how much support Trump received. In fact, it obscures how much support he had, which is why he uses it.\n\nAD\n\nTrump received nearly 3 million fewer votes than Clinton did. The margin was only slightly smaller than George W. Bush\u2019s victory in 2004 \u2014 and nearly six times Al Gore\u2019s margin against Bush in 2000, when Bush similarly went on to win the electoral vote.\n\nAt no point in time was Trump above 50 percent in 2016 presidential election polling. He received less than 50 percent of the vote. As president, he has never been above 50 percent in RealClearPolitics\u2019s average of approval polling. Somewhat ironically, he has consistently represented the minority in national polling.\n\nAD\n\n3. Have you seen Richard Nixon\u2019s map in 1972?\n\nCompare that with Richard Nixon. In 1972, Nixon won reelection by 18 million votes. His electoral map looked fairly similar to Trump\u2019s in the middle of the country because, as in 2016, there still weren\u2019t a lot of people living there.\n\nThe difference between Nixon\u2019s landslide and Trump\u2019s good luck is in how red the coasts are on Nixon\u2019s map. He won Los Angeles and even parts of New York City. His was an overwhelming victory, and, in his case, the dearth of blue is actually somewhat revelatory.\n\nAD\n\nAnd guess what happened to Nixon.\n\nThat\u2019s right: Faced with imminent impeachment and probable removal from office, he resigned from office in the summer of 1974. What\u2019s more, the cascade of events that led to his downfall actually stemmed from the 1972 election. The Watergate break-in was part of an effort to spy on the Democratic Party, an effort that was obviously unnecessary, given how broad his victory was.\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s some poetry in it, really. Nixon\u2019s 1972 electoral map represents the mistakes he made that led to his ouster. The nation was all set to try to impeach, but ended up not needing to.\n\n4. Trump\u2019s map isn\u2019t even accurate.\n\nIt appears that Trump\u2019s map captured the results of the 2016 race at some point before vote totals were finalized. There are a number of counties \u2014 including some with a lot of land area! \u2014 that are red on the map but should be blue. For example:\n\nWe didn\u2019t highlight Alaska because, well, look at Alaska.\n\nAD\n\nAgain, though, the point is that this doesn\u2019t matter: These places are mostly places where not many people live. Like that county in Minnesota \u2014 it was home to about 6,500 voters. If we\u2019re playing this game, though, let\u2019s at least play it properly.\n\nIn summary, then, we have this: Trump shared a map meant to show how his support would preempt any impeachment effort, except that it instead obscured how little support he has, was incorrect and is quickly undercut by considering what happened to Nixon 50 years ago.\n\nOther than that, great tweet.\n\nAD", "description": "Some of the reasons are more obvious than others.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ozgeQgZD77-EsydjKv8zZj4LlBc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6IIXGFHEAQI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
