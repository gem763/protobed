It last sold in 1983 for $770,000.\n\nAccording to buyers' agent Rodney McLoughlin, Sydney buyers were fighting over properties within a 10 kilometre radius of the CBD that were priced anywhere between $1.5 million and $10 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's got absolutely crazy,\" he said. \"People are fighting for properties and are missing out on properties left, right and centre.\"\n\nRaine & Horne's Peter Starr, who sold the Bellevue Hill property under the hammer, has also chosen to take a four-bedroom harbourfront home at Kurraba Point to auction next month given competition is heating up.\n\n\"Good properties are hard to price at the moment and in any market the buyers dictate the price, not the sellers, so you don't want to get caught short by not exposing it to the full market,\" Mr Starr said.\n\nVictoria: 1 Stonnington Place in Toorak sold well above the reserve price.\n\n\"With 111 Victoria Road, the underbidder pushed himself more than $1 million more than I think he would have otherwise been willing to pay in a pre-auction situation. He needed to see the competition to know he wasn't doing the wrong thing.\"\n\nIn Melbourne, a three-bedroom house on 590sq m at 1 Stonnington Place in Toorak ended up in a boardroom auction on Saturday evening, with a reserve of $5 million. It sold for $6.005 million.\n\n\"Anything good is going through the roof. And if it's not, it's either overpriced or it's a lemon,\" Melbourne buyers' agent David Morrell said.\n\nKay & Burton's Robert Fletcher and Michael Gibson would not comment on the sale but said heightened competition in the market meant the \"price point opportunity of an auction is climbing\".", "description": "Idyllic spring weather combined with record low interest rates and renewed market confidence has kickstarted the top-end property market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4405%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_140%2C$y_72/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b7904153f658ff794feddd2b9ca37a82bf78d4dd", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
