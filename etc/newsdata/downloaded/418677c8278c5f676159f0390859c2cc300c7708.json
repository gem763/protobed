REUTERS/Jennifer Gauthier\n\n\u201cCanadians will head to the polls on Oct. 21,\u201d Trudeau told reporters after Governor General Julie Payette, the acting head of state, agreed to dissolve parliament.\n\nTrudeau and his main opponent, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, are in a dead heat according to national polls, but smaller parties on the right and left could also play key roles as spoilers or kingmakers on election day.\n\nCanada\u2019s official campaign period has often been fraught with unexpected turns that can lead to unforeseen outcomes. The ruling Liberals were in third place when the 2015 campaign started, but pulled off an outright victory.\n\n\u201cThe formal campaign absolutely has a history of dramatically changing outcomes,\u201d said Paul Adams, a professor at Carleton University in Ottawa and a former political reporter.\n\nThe five upcoming leaders\u2019 debates are important, too, Adams said, with the first scheduled for Thursday, though without Trudeau, who declined an invitation. Trudeau will do only three of the five debates.\n\nAll the candidates had planned appearances at battleground ridings, or districts, to talk about climate change, the economy, and other hotbutton issues.\n\nBut before Trudeau could start his campaign in Vancouver, British Colombia (B.C.) on Wednesday evening, he had to deal with a barrage of questions regarding a long-running scandal involving allegations he tried to influence his former justice minister\u2019s handling of a corporate corruption case.\n\nOn the tarmac before flying to his first rally of the day in Quebec, Scheer said Trudeau \u201chas lost the moral authority to govern\u201d.\n\nThen Scheer\u2019s plane took off only to be diverted by fog, forcing everyone to jump on buses for more than an hour in order to reach his first campaign event on the banks of the St. Lawrence River.\n\nROCK-N-ROLL\n\nTrudeau and Scheer both have campaign jets with their names emblazoned on the fuselage. Only Scheer, however, has an original campaign tune penned by Jim Vallance, the songwriter who helped Canadian rock star Bryan Adams pen \u201cSummer of \u201869.\u201d\n\nThe electric guitar-driven song is called \u201cGet Ahead\u201d and riffs off of Scheer\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to get ahead\u201d campaign slogan.\n\nThe left-wing New Democrat Party (NDP) packed both staff and journalists onto one bus. The party, which led the pack at the start of the 2015 campaign but ended up coming in third place, is dipping in the polls and struggling to raise money this year.\n\nNDP leader Jagmeet Singh kicked off his campaign in London, Ontario, with 85 nominations still to make in order to field a candidate in each of Canada\u2019s 338 ridings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some challenges but are ready to solve that and we will absolutely have candidates in every riding,\u201d Singh said.\n\nFinally, a satirical political group that calls itself the Rhinoceros Party - but which is recognized by Canada\u2019s federal election regulator as a registered party - said it plans to field a candidate to run against Maxime Bernier, the leader of the right-wing People\u2019s Party of Canada (PPC).\n\nThe Rhinoceros Party says it wants challenge the PPC leader in his own riding with their own candidate, also named Maxime Bernier.\n\nThe Rhinoceros Party\u2019s Bernier has made a mandatory vasectomy for men 16 years of age or older one of his campaign promises so that \u201cCanada will be a world leader in the fight against climate change\u201d, according to the website.\n\nThe PPC\u2019s Bernier, on the other hand, does not believe climate change is caused by human activity.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday formally launched a six-week campaign for re-election in which he and his rivals will crisscross the country in planes and on buses to try to win over voters.", "authors": ["Steve Scherer", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428911412&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B04W-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
