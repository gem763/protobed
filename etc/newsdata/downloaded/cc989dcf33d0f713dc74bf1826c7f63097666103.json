Ingram\u2019s job involves helping Airbnb create an inclusive experience for both hosts and users, and fight discriminatory practices. So on any given day, she might be flying off to speak at a conference on the other side of the country \u2014 or possibly the other side of the world.\n\nIt\u2019s a big job, but she\u2019s used to it. Prior to Airbnb, Ingram was the national executive director at National Action Network, a civil-rights organization. She\u2019s also one of the founding members of the Women\u2019s March, where she served as head of logistics for the first march in 2017. And before that, she cut her teeth working at nonprofits across New York and New Jersey.\n\nThe Cut managed to catch up with Ingram recently at Airbnb\u2019s offices in New York. Read on to hear about her best packing tips, the shoe she\u2019ll always wear, and why she doesn\u2019t look to clothes to give her confidence.\n\nOn the shoes she wears every day: I hate overpacking. Shoes take up a lot of space in a suitcase, so I bring one good pair of boots. Last fall, I wore Hudson London\u2019s Crispin ankle booties everywhere. I also found a pair of Seven Dials over-the-knee boots that were so comfortable and versatile that I bought another pair towards the end of the season \u2014 plus pairs for my mom and sister!\n\nOn going out after work: Back when I was in Washington, D.C., I\u2019d go to politico events, and they\u2019re usually the same dress code as what I wore to work. But now that I\u2019m in tech, it\u2019s more relaxed and my outfits skew casual. If I have to go out, I\u2019ll dress for the day and change my shoes and accessories. I love chunky bracelets. While they\u2019re annoying when you\u2019re typing away, they\u2019re great for after-hours.\n\nOn big meeting outfits: I remember speaking on a panel at the White House with Michelle Obama, and one of my friends was trying to help me pick out an outfit. She kept showing me pantsuits, but none of them felt right. They might radiate a certain power but I\u2019m more comfortable in a sleek dress, and that\u2019s what I wound up wearing. I typically shop at department stores with lots of options and don\u2019t look for a specific designer. That said, I find that Amanda Uprichard, Dress the Population, and Black Halo work well for my body and the types of events I attend.\n\nPhoto: Gabriela Herman\n\nOn traveling for work: After I left my job as national executive director at National Action Network, I spent a lot of time hopping between countries. I learned how to pack for longer periods of time in a carry-on. And with my current job, I\u2019m usually going from plane straight to my first meeting. For the sake of efficiency, I have a time-consuming ritual where I try everything on before I pack \u2014 that\u2019s how I know my pieces work well together, especially if I\u2019ve never worn them together before. I also love packing cubes! They help me separate my clothes in a way that also allows me to stay neat while traveling.\n\nOn speaking engagements: When I need to speak, a jumpsuit and a great pair of pumps is my first option. It makes moving around a lot easier and is better for sitting on a stage. I use Rent the Runway a lot. Typically, there are a lot of photos at those types of events and I don\u2019t want to be photographed in the same outfit, so Rent the Runway has been super helpful.\n\nOn who she dresses for: While I dress for me, I know first impressions matter. I don\u2019t want my clothing to be a distraction for me or others, so I try to be slightly more formal than what an occasion calls for. My outfits are also determined by my mood and the weather. I sometimes dress up just because it makes me feel good or because the weather is nice \u2014 even if I don\u2019t see anyone outside of my 15 or so work colleagues.\n\nOn her style evolution: My look is classic but still on-trend. I actually still have pieces in my closet that are over a decade old and they don\u2019t look outdated! But as I\u2019ve grown professionally and personally, my style has become more sophisticated. In high school and college I used to wear a lot of black and my friends would joke that my uniform was a black shirt and jeans. Now, I like to play with colors and patterns. I incorporate pieces that are bolder than what I would have worn previously.\n\nOne lesson that I learned was to invest in certain pieces. I\u2019m a bargain shopper and hate paying full price for anything. When I was younger, I\u2019d buy a lot of disposable, cheap pieces that last a season or less. I\u2019d do it with purses especially. I\u2019d buy a cute handbag that wasn\u2019t made of quality materials and a month in, it would start falling apart. Now I spend a bit more and I have a few Kate Spade and Rebecca Minkoff bags that I really love.\n\nOn the last three things she bought: I recently returned from a trip to Ghana for the Year of Return and I wanted to wear Ankara prints while there, so before my trip I bought some items from a retailer called D\u2019IYANU. The fit was really great and I received tons of compliments. I also ordered Schutz mules and wedges. I love their shoes and even though summer is over, I\u2019d been eyeing the sandals for a while and they were on sale! And then I bought a sparkly dress by Rizzo. It\u2019s for a photo with my sorority sisters in celebration of membership anniversary.\n\nOn the one item that gives her the most confidence: When I was younger, I used to reach for my Louis Vuitton Lussac (with matching wallet!) or my Christian Louboutin Maudissima pumps. But they were gifts and I felt inauthentic in them \u2014 it wasn\u2019t something I thought I could afford. Now that I\u2019m making more money, I\u2019d rather donate to nonprofits or invest it instead of buying luxury accessories.\n\nI think the most impressive thing I can wear isn\u2019t an item of clothing or an accessory but my smile. It sounds trite, but it\u2019s true. I love fashion and I love looking pulled together. But I think I can still be stylish and impressive even if I don\u2019t have the most expensive shoes, bag, or piece of jewelry. If I show up wearing my smile and being true to who I am, I\u2019m hopeful that my inner light will impress people.\n\nShop the Story\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "In the latest In Her Shoes, the Cut talks to Airbnb\u2019s Head of Partnerships, Janaye Ingram.
