Giuliani, his private lawyer, produce communications and other records related to his attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the president\u2019s Democratic rivals.\n\nThe new demands of Mr. Giuliani and separate requests sent to three of his associates said to be involved in the Ukraine matter suggest that Democrats are moving quickly to stand up their investigation, even as Mr. Trump questioned on Monday whether the chairman leading their impeachment inquiry, Representative Adam B. Schiff, should be arrested for treason.\n\n\u201cOur inquiry includes an investigation of credible allegations that you acted as an agent of the president in a scheme to advance his personal political interests by abusing the power of the office of the president,\u201d Mr. Schiff and two fellow Democratic chairmen, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of the Oversight and Reform Committee and Representative Eliot L. Engel of the Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote in a letter to Mr. Giuliani.", "description": "Rudolph W.
