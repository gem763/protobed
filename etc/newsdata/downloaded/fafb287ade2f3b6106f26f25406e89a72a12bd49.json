(Picture: BBC)\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen Martin Fowler (James Bye) in EastEnders for a while since he and wife Stacey (Lacey Turner) went on the run from Walford.\n\nUntil now that is, with Martin making a return to Albert Square in the wake of Bex (Jasmine Armfield)\u2019s suicide attempt, only to get a roasting from Sonia (Natalie Cassidy) for not being there when his daughter needed him.\n\nOf course Martin left Walford under very different circumstances \u2013 so just why have he and Stacey been away?\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know\u2026\n\nWhy is Martin Fowler on the run in EastEnders?\n\nMartin Fowler has fled Albert Square with Stacey in tow in order to escape the clutches of Ben Mitchell (Max Bowden) \u2013 who knew that she was behind the attack which left his dad Phil (Steve McFadden) in a critical condition.\n\nMartin\u2019s there for Bex after her suicide attempt (Picture: BBC)\n\nThe storyline was written to accommodate Lacey Turner\u2019s maternity leave from the show, with the actress having recently given birth to her first child, daughter Dusty Rose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not clear where they\u2019ve been since they left although the Slater have been telling people they\u2019re visiting Stacey\u2019s brother Sean (Robert Kazinsky).\n\nMartin\u2019s return to the Square came on Friday as Sonia was seen desperately trying to get in touch with him, only for his phone to go to voicemail \u2013 leaving her berating him for not caring about his daughter.\n\nExcept, unbeknown to her, he was already back \u2013 and gave Sonia the shock of her life when she found him beside Bex\u2019s hospital bed.\n\nExpect the feud with Ben to continue in coming episodes as Martin agrees to stick around for Bex\u2019s sake \u2013 except his nemesis spots him from across the Square.\n\nAll of which will spell trouble for him as he begs to allow Stacey to come back to Walford \u2013 only to end up being drafted into Ben\u2019s dodgy dealings.\n\nWhat will happen next? You\u2019ll have to keep watching for that one.\n\nEastEnders airs Mondays and Fridays on BBC One at 8pm and on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7.30pm.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
