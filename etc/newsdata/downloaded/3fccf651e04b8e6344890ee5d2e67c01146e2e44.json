(AP) - Tony Jones Jr. rushed for a career-high 176 yards and Jonathan Doerer kicked three long field goals as No. 9 Notre Dame held off longtime rival Southern California 30-27 Saturday night.\n\nThe Fighting Irish (5-1), who rushed for a season-high 308 yards, clinched their third straight victory over the Trojans (3-3) on Ian Book\u2019s 8-yard run with 3:33 left.\n\nBook\u2019s touchdown ended a 14-play, 75-yard drive that took 6:54 off the clock after USC had drawn within 23-20.\n\nThe Trojans\u2019 Markese Stepp, who ran for 82 yards, scored from the 2 with 1:04 left to make it 30-27. But Notre Dame\u2019s Brock Wright recovered the onside kick, and the Irish ran out the clock.\n\nJones\u2019 fourth 100-yard game of the season came on 25 carries. He had 12 runs for 120 yards in the first half.\n\nThe Irish led 17-3 at half after Book threw a 10-yard TD pass to Cole Kmet, wide receiver Braden Lenzy ran 51 yards on a reverse and Doerer kicked a 43-yard field goal. The half ended with the teams engaging in some pushing and shoving before they headed to their locker rooms.\n\nDoerer added field goals of 52 and 43 yards in the second half to keep the Irish ahead.\n\nUSC freshman Kedon Slovis completed 24 of 35 passes for 255 yards in his first game back from a concussion three weeks ago.\n\nSlovis threw touchdown passes of 38 yards to Amon-Ra St. Brown in the third quarter and 5 yards to Tyler Vaughns in the fourth.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nUSC: Slovis completed 10 of 17 passes for 74 yards in the first half but was sacked three times and hurried on four other occasions by Notre Dame\u2019s defense, which switched between three- and four-man fronts. After intermission, Slovis was 14 of 18 for 181 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nNotre Dame: The Irish punted on their first three series but finished the half with 196 yards on the ground. Jones carried the load, bursting up the middle for 43 yards on a nine-play, 97-yard scoring drive that gave his team a 7-3 lead.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nNotre Dame: The Irish likely won\u2019t move up even with South Carolina\u2019s 20-17 double-overtime victory at No. 3 Georgia. That\u2019s because the Irish lost 23-17 at Georgia last month.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nUSC plays Arizona at home on Oct. 19.\n\nNotre Dame has an open date before an Oct. 26 visit to No. 16 Michigan.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tony Jones Jr. rushed for a career-high 176 yards and Jonathan Doerer kicked three long field goals as No. 9 Notre Dame held off longtime rival Southern California 30-27 Saturday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Fineran"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/usc_notre_dame_football_99313_c0-207-4947-3092_s1200x700.jpg?7da1751bb20fea6360a9edd9b8e2d2abb3ef93f3", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
