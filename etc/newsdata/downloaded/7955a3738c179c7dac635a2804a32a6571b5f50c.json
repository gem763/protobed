John Kasich (R-OH) called it \u201cdead wrong for President Donald Trump to ask for \u201cdirt\u201d in his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nHost Jake Tapper asked why Republicans won\u2019t say if it is wrong for a president \u201cto use his office to ask a foreign country to investigate their domestic political rivals.\u201d\n\nKasich said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand it. Of course, it is wrong. And I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re afraid of. Nobody is asking them, are you for impeachment inquiry or impeachment? Nobody is asking them. They just say it is this right or wrong, and they won\u2019t answer it, and it is a mystery to me. When I went through re-election, I had expanded Medicaid. And so I was out there telling people, this is why I did it. I\u2019m not afraid of things. I\u2019m going to tell people what I\u2019ve for. It is true I don\u2019t hold office today. I suspected that this president was going to engage in this kind of behavior, and it is why I didn\u2019t go to the Republican convention. It\u2019s why I didn\u2019t vote for him, and I don\u2019t intend to vote for him again.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cLook in the mirror and figure out how do you want to be remembered later. There is nothing wrong with telling the truth and sharing your real feelings. I have a couple of things the Democrats should do. There should be a vote on inquiry in the House. I don\u2019t understand why they don\u2019t do that. And I\u2019m also looking forward to the testimony of Sondland, the especially envoy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to all of that conversation, all about the text messages that we saw,\u201d Kasich added. \u201cBecause I think we want to get established in our minds whether there really was a quid pro quo. Of course, it is dead wrong for the president to ever talk to another leader to bring up dirt on his political opponent.\u201d\n\nTapper interjected, \u201cWith or without the quid pro quo.\u201d\n\nKasich continued, \u201cIt is just dead wrong. But if you go to another level and there is establishment of a quid pro quo, maybe that many Republicans, if it is established, that Republicans would say, yeah, that is a step too far.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "During Sunday's broadcast of CNN's \"State of the Union,\" former Gov.
