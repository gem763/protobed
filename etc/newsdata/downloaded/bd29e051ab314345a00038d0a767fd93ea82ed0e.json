REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nAn anticipated fiery matchup between Biden, the moderate former vice president, and Elizabeth Warren, a liberal senator who has gained the No. 2 spot in recent opinion polls, did not quite materialize.\n\nU.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, running a close third, sounded hoarse as he expounded on his favorite progressive topics, including healthcare, political corruption and income inequality.\n\nTheir lower-polling rivals vied to make a mark in the race to challenge incumbent Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election, while another 10 Democratic candidates who did not qualify for the debate sat out this round.\n\nHere is a look at how each of the top 10 candidates did in the Houston debate:\n\nJOE BIDEN\n\nThe former vice president\u2019s best moments in Thursday\u2019s debate came early on, when he entered into a spirited exchange with his closest rivals, Sanders and Warren, over healthcare policy.\n\nBiden was able to defend his plan, which would build on President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, while questioning the price tag of Sanders\u2019 and Warren\u2019s more sweeping Medicare for All proposals.\n\nAt one point, a clearly perturbed Sanders began lecturing Biden, an image that probably helped Biden\u2019s pragmatic persona as much as anything.\n\nSanders also seemed to blame Biden for consumers stricken with cancer being unable to afford treatments. That hit Biden too close to home: He lost his son Beau to brain cancer in 2015.\n\n\u201cI know a lot about cancer, let me tell you something,\u201d Biden snapped back. \u201cIt\u2019s personal to me.\u201d\n\nBiden, 76, who has faced questions about his stamina and his misstatements on the trail, avoided significant gaffes on Thursday.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS\n\nThe progressive U.S. senator from Vermont gave a full-throated defense of democratic socialism, sounding painfully hoarse as he explained the viability of Medicare for All and railed against corporate greed.\n\nSince the last debate in July, Sanders has seen his friend and fellow liberal Warren inch past him in opinion polls for the No. 2 spot in the Democratic contest. Still, both senators continued to steer clear of personal attacks, instead stressing policy and ideology.\n\nSanders, at 78 the oldest candidate in the 2020 race, appeared slightly less robust with his voice raspier than usual.\n\nHe was forced to defend his signature Medicare for All legislation early on, with Biden criticizing it as too expensive.\n\n\u201cEvery study done shows that Medicare for All is the most cost-effective approach to providing healthcare to every man, woman and child in this country,\u201d Sanders said, noting as he did in the last debate that he \u201cwrote the damn bill.\u201d\n\nELIZABETH WARREN\n\nWarren has risen to second place in most polls since the previous debate, yet she largely managed to avoid the attacks from fellow candidates that often come with moving into the front of the pack.\n\nInstead, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts assumed one of her favorite positions: pairing up with Sanders to tag-team defending their shared advocacy of Medicare for All, a government takeover of the U.S. healthcare insurance system.\n\nWarren defended accusations from Biden that the proposal would result in raising taxes for the middle class, arguing that working families would see their overall costs go down.\n\n\u201cCosts are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for hardworking families across this country, costs are going to go down, and that\u2019s how it should work under Medicare for All in our healthcare system.\u201d\n\nKAMALA HARRIS\n\nThe U.S. senator from California, who made waves when she attacked front-runner Biden and others in previous debates, turned her attention to a safer target this time.\n\nHarris blamed Trump for cultivating a culture of \u201chate and intimidation\u201d amid recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio.\n\n\u201cObviously he didn\u2019t pull the trigger, but he\u2019s certainly been tweeting out the ammunition,\u201d she said.\n\nShe likened the president to the titular character from the 1939 film \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d \u201cWhen you pull back the curtain, it\u2019s a really small dude,\u201d Harris said.\n\nAt one point, Harris looked directly into the camera and spoke to Trump, \u201cwho we all know is watching,\u201d saying the \u201cAmerican people are so much better\u201d than what he espouses.\n\n\u201cAnd now President Trump,\u201d Harris said, \u201cyou can go back to watching Fox News.\u201d\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG\n\nThe mayor of South Bend, Indiana, had several bright moments and showed his usual firm grasp of policy. But he failed to land a breakout moment that might propel him into the top tier of candidates.\n\nButtigieg, a fundraising juggernaut, has struggled to garner more than 5% support among Democratic voters in national polls over recent weeks.\n\nHe had one of his best moments when the debate turned to the war in Afghanistan, and he said he would require Congress to vote on whether to send troops to war. Buttigieg served seven months in Afghanistan in the Naval reserve.\n\n\u201cIf our troops can summon the courage to go overseas, the least our members of Congress should be able to do is summon the courage and take a vote on whether they ought to be there,\u201d he said to applause.\n\nANDREW YANG\n\nThe entrepreneur\u2019s campaign is centered on his plan to give every American a \u201cfreedom dividend\u201d of $1,000 a month. On Thursday, he offered 10 Americans a taste of it.\n\nYang asked people watching the debate to go to his website and explain how $1,000 a month would help solve their problems. His campaign will select 10 recipients for a total of $120,000 in campaign funds.\n\n\u201cWhen you donate money to a presidential campaign, what happens?\u201d he said. \u201cThe politician spends the money on TV ads and consultants, and you hope it works out. It\u2019s time to trust ourselves more than our politicians.\u201d\n\nThe announcement drew a hearty laugh from U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, who said, \u201cThat\u2019s good!\u201d Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said, \u201cIt\u2019s original, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d\n\nYang also dropped one of the night\u2019s biggest laugh lines during a discussion on healthcare, saying, \u201cNow, I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors.\u201d\n\nBETO O\u2019ROURKE\n\nHaving found new focus in the wake of a tragedy, former U.S. Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke forcefully challenged Trump and called for confiscation of assault rifles across the country.\n\nO\u2019Rourke described the mass shooting last month in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, as a \u201cturning point for this country\u201d and one that was fueled by what he described as unresolved, systemic racism. He again called Trump a white supremacist and said the president \u201cposes a mortal threat to people of color all across the country.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke largely resisted the urge to utter a vulgarity after ABC, host of the night\u2019s televised debate, warned candidates not to swear. The warning came after O\u2019Rourke cursed in an interview on CNN earlier this month.\n\nBut O\u2019Rourke seemed to relish the chance to bend that rule when asked by a moderator if he would support confiscation of certain types of assault rifles that have been used in mass shootings.\n\n\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nCORY BOOKER\n\nU.S. Senator Booker of New Jersey has been mired at roughly 2% in Democratic polls for months, a poor showing that has puzzled many analysts given what they say is his eloquence, wit and command of policy.\n\nThose traits were on display on Thursday night as Booker repeatedly sought to strike a unifying message with his rivals on stage, drawing a positive response from the audience.\n\n\u201cThe differences amongst us Democrats on the stage are not as great as the urgency for us to unite as a party, not just to beat Donald Trump, but to unite America in common cause and common purpose,\u201d he said in his opening statement.\n\nBooker, who is black, has made racism a central issue of his campaign. But he stressed he wants practical solutions to combat it. \u201cRacism exists. The question isn\u2019t who isn\u2019t a racist, it\u2019s who is and isn\u2019t doing something about racism,\u201d Booker said.\n\nBooker, who also is bald, drew one of the biggest laughs of the night when he referred to Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister with a thick head of hair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the only person on this stage that finds Trudeau\u2019s hair very menacing, but they are not a national security threat,\u201d he said, mocking the use of national security grounds by the Trump administration to justify tariffs on Canada.\n\nAMY KLOBUCHAR\n\nThe U.S. senator from Minnesota held fast to her Midwestern roots, stressing her middle-of-the-road politics and painting some rivals as too extreme to win the November 2020 general election.\n\nThis time around, however, Klobuchar had a comeback for rival Sanders\u2019 well-worn \u201cI wrote the damn bill\u201d quip about his Medicare for All plan.\n\n\u201cWhile Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill,\u201d she said, drawing laughter.\n\nShe criticized his plan for eliminating private health insurance, saying 149 million Americans would lose their current health insurance. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bold idea. I think it\u2019s a bad idea,\u201d she deadpanned.\n\nMostly, though, the three-term senator strove to underscore areas of agreement with rivals. During the harshest exchange of the night, when former housing secretary Julian Castro accused Biden of forgetting what he had just said, Klobuchar channeled legendary President Abraham Lincoln, interjecting, \u201cA house divided cannot stand.\u201d\n\nJULIAN CASTRO\n\nThe usually milder Castro went home with the attack dog trophy on Thursday night after taking a couple of pointed jabs at Biden, including questioning the front-runner\u2019s memory in an exchange that did not go over well with the Houston audience.\n\nCastro, President Obama\u2019s housing secretary, clashed with Biden over how the former vice president described a provision in his healthcare plan.\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?\u201d Castro said, drawing a low roar of disapproval from the crowd.\n\nThe Texan later claimed, \u201cI\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be a surprise to him,\u201d Biden retorted.\n\nThe sharp exchange drew criticism from Buttigieg as typical Washington point scoring, but Castro was unapologetic.\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s called the Democratic primary election, Pete,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s called an election.\u201d", "description": "Some of the 10 Democratic presidential candidates meeting in their third debate on Thursday took shots at front-runner Joe Biden, while others called for unity during a night dominated by questions around race, guns and healthcare.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429326703&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0CY", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
