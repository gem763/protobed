They dropped from the sky.\"\n\nA number of unexploded devices were found and removed safely.\n\nCourt records seen by The Morning Call allege that Muzzicato's car had also been \"modified\" with switches for releasing nails, ball bearings, and fluids.\n\nCNET: See creepy deepfake Vladimir Putin interviewed live at MIT conference\n\nMuzzicato's attorney, John Waldron, denied that his client used a drone to drop explosives, saying there is no \"conclusive evidence.\"\n\nMuzzicato has been in jail since his arrest in June when law enforcement searched his property and found objects that potentially connect him to the explosions. In total, the Phantom 3, seven improvised explosive devices, and ten firearms were found, including multiple AR-15s.\n\nThe man was previously restrained from harassing, stalking, or threatening a partner by way of a Protection From Abuse (PFA) order issued in 2017. During the dispute, both former partners filed a PFA order against the other.\n\nMuzzicato has been charged with possessing firearms while subject to this court order -- a federal offense -- and has also been charged as an unlawful user of methamphetamine, possessing improvised explosive devices, and the operation of an unregistered drone.\n\nTechRepublic: Why businesses would rather lose revenue than data\n\n\"It does not take much imagination to conjure up the enormous harm that can result from the combination of illegal firearms, explosives, and drone aircrafts,\" said US Attorney McSwain. \"Adding methamphetamine and a disregard of court orders to the mix only serves to heighten the risk. Here the defendant's alleged behavior violated the law and threatened public safety.\"\n\nIf convicted, Muzzicato faces up to 33 years behind bars, three years of supervised release, and a fine reaching a maximum of $760,000.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
