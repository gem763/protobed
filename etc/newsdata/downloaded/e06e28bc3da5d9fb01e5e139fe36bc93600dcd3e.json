REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\n\u201cWe recognized that North Korea\u2019s rogue behavior could not be ignored,\u201d Pompeo said on Tuesday, while speaking at the American Legion National Convention in the state of Indiana.\n\nPompeo\u2019s comment was unreasonable and provocative, Choe said, according to the news agency.\n\n\u201cPompeo has gone so far in his language and it made the opening of the expected DPRK-U.S. working-level negotiations more difficult,\u201d Choe said in statement.\u201d\n\nChoe also warned that North Korea\u2019s expectations of talks with the United States are gradually disappearing and the country is being pushed to reexamine all measures.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. had better not put our patience to the test any longer with such remarks irritating us if it doesn\u2019t want to have bitter regrets afterwards,\u201d Choe said.\n\nNorth Korea has stepped up its criticism of Pompeo lately, calling him a \u201cdiehard toxin\u201d, and casting doubt on attempts to restart talks\n\nIn Washington, a State Department official indicated on Saturday that the United States remained interested in pursuing talks.\n\n\u201cAs we have indicated, we are prepared to engage in negotiations as soon as we hear from our counterparts in North Korea,\u201d said the official, who asked not to be named.\n\nNegotiations aimed at dismantling the North\u2019s nuclear and missile programs have stalled since a failed second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi in February.\n\nTrump and Kim met again in June at the inter-Korean border and agreed to reopen working-level negotiations, but that has not happened.\n\nSince the Vietnam summit, North Korea has demanded that Pompeo be replaced with a \u201cmore mature\u201d person, while lauding the rapport built between Kim and Trump.\n\nNorth Korea has fired a series of short-range missiles in recent weeks in protest against U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises and the adoption of new weapons, complicating the reopening of the talks.", "description": "A recent remark by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about \"North Korea's rogue behavior\" will make talks with the United States more difficult, the North's KCNA news agency on Saturday quoted its vice foreign minister, Choe Son Hui, as saying.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190831&t=2&i=1424714096&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7U05A"}
