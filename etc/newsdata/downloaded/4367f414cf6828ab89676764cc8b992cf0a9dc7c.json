When Tom Hanks falls down the stairs in a regular movie, you can do what you like with the music, but when Woody falls it's gotta be 'ba-doop-ba-doop-ba-doop-ba-doop'.\"\n\nNewman doesn't mind that the theme to an animated movie franchise is destined to overshadow his edgier work.\n\n\"They've been pretty good pictures, and that song is a big deal to some people at my shows,\" he says.\n\n\"If I'm now the Toy Story guy, that's the way it goes. It's better than, 'Newman, 86, died yesterday, composer of Short People',\" he jokes.\n\nAFR Weekend had sworn not to bring up that song, which is his biggest hit under his own name \u2013 it reached No. 2 in the US and No. 12 in Australia \u2013 and which he has been forced to explain in seemingly every interview since its release in 1978.\n\nA litmus test for whether curious Toy Story fans will dig any further into Newman's back catalogue, Short People has him mockingly playing a lunatic with a disdain for the height-challenged.\n\n\"Short people got no reason to live,\" the weirdo warbles on the hook.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCatchy nonetheless, the song got airplay and spread well beyond Newman's irony appreciating core audience, with outrage inevitably triggered.\n\n\"The news showed people throwing pie at my picture,\" Newman recalls. \"As if I was the leader of some cabal against the diminutive. I mean who could take the guy in that song seriously?\"\n\nPlenty did, like the Maryland legislator who moved to have Short People banned from the state's airwaves. The attorney-general's office replied, memorably, that a ban would not only violate the First Amendment, but also force deejays to blacklist Elton John's Tiny Dancer, and compel Little Richard to change his name.\n\nNewman doubts it would come to that today.\n\n\"Would Short People even be released as a single in 2019? I don't think so. I'm Dreaming Of A White President is one I definitely couldn't get away with now,\" he says, referring to the single he released ahead of Barack Obama's re-election, in which another bigot pleasures himself with thoughts of a return to the status quo.\n\n\"There's been a loss of sense of humour when it comes to parody. People seem to take things more literally and seriously, and that's for the worse.\"\n\nStill, Newman is toying with writing a song about the current US president.\n\n\"My Life Is Good is about egomaniacs like him, but as for a 'Trump song'...it's hard because he's such an easy target,\" he says.\n\n\"Satirising Trump is like kicking the ground after you've skydived on it. I've thought about doing it as a letter from [daughter] Ivanka, asking if he's OK.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe song couldn't be more original than Putin, from Newman's 2017 album Dark Matter, a broadcast from inside the head of that other egomaniac president. \"I dragged these peasants kicking and screaming/ Into the 21st century,\" the Russian fumes over a backing of Stravinsky-meets-jazz, \"these chicken farmers and file clerks gonna be the death of me.\"\n\nRandy Newman is a sharp political satirist. Reuters\n\nBetween these detours into explicitly topical songwriting, and another recent brush with the mainstream via a cameo on a Chance The Rapper album, there is still some chance that Toy Story won't be Newman's defining achievement.\n\n\"I got a song right now that lends itself to the whole autotune, modern pop treatment,\" Newman reveals, before humming a few bars of Dinosaur, a rare autobiographical lyric in his oeuvre.\n\nA knee replacement in August has further refreshed his outlook, to the extent he may even climb the Sydney Harbour Bridge next year.\n\n\"I watched my wife and daughter do it last time, so who knows? I don't wanna live that bad anyway,\" he says, mordant as ever.\n\nRandy Newman's Australian tour starts in Perth on January 30.", "description": "The veteran singer-songwriter retains his sardonic edge, but says satire is getting harder.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.4537%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_39/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e785ad5ef36f7b69634ae22b09c2ed368e5cadaa", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
