Lorenzo passed without major damage.\n\nCan Boris Johnson\u2019s border plan break the Brexit deadlock? Read more\n\nThe other atmospheric disturbance billowed in from England, where Boris Johnson revealed the UK government\u2019s Brexit plan for a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, a potentially chilling prospect for peace and prosperity on the island. The prime minister\u2019s long-awaited proposal sent officials and politicians in Dublin, Belfast and Brussels scrambling for position in the next phase of the UK\u2019s tortuous effort to leave the European Union.\n\nAround Gortmullan, businesses and ordinary people were left wondering if \u2013 and where \u2013 to seek cover, a dilemma dating from the 2016 referendum result that now thrummed with urgency.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re setting up new companies on both sides of the border,\u201d said Liam McCaffrey, CEO of Quinn Industrial Holdings, which supplies building materials.\n\nCustoms checks would be bad enough, but Johnson\u2019s apparent plan to give the Stormont assembly a veto over trading arrangements verged on surreal, said McCaffrey. Power sharing in Northern Ireland collapsed in January 2017 and shows little sign of reviving. \u201cThe future of how we trade is to be decided every four years by an assembly that hasn\u2019t sat in three years? Bizarre.\u201d\n\nSuch was the challenge of Storm Boris. Perhaps it was hot air, a plan destined for oblivion to be superseded by who knows what. Or perhaps it was a blast of what is to come in a no-deal crash-out, or a deal negotiated in the next few weeks or after a general election. The uncertainty was head spinning.\n\nJonathan Powell, Britain\u2019s chief negotiator in Northern Ireland from 1997 to 2007, struck an ominous tone. \u201cBe under no misapprehension, there will have to be checks and there will be a hard border which will undermine the basis on which the Good Friday agreement was built in trying to find a way of dealing peacefully with the different identities of the different communities in Northern Ireland,\u201d he wrote in the Belfast Telegraph.\n\n\u201cBut the danger I fear for Northern Ireland is that it becomes the mouse as the two elephants \u2013 the EU and the British government \u2013 mate, and it is Northern Ireland that will lose out in any agreement they reach with very dangerous long-term consequences.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jonathan Powell, former chief British negotiator on Northern Ireland.

The 1998 Good Friday agreement and the EU\u2019s single market rendered it invisible, helping to seal the peace.\n\nIn Gortmullan \u2013 a patchwork of farms, bungalows and hedgerows \u2013 there are no road markings to indicate the frontier. Jack McGann, 16, who works at a service station just inside the Irish border, hesitated when asked to identify where the UK began. \u201cI\u2019m not 100% sure. I think it\u2019s over there by the shed, the line goes along the middle of it,\u201d he said, pointing at a derelict structure with a tin roof abutting a road. There are about 300 other border crossings.\n\nMcGann has never known customs checks, army searches or terrorist attacks. \u201cMy parents told me stories about the hard border. I heard it was tough.\u201d\n\nEugene McAffrey, who worked at an adjacent service station just inside Northern Ireland, sighed at the mention of Brexit. \u201cIt\u2019s occupying the mind of everyone that walks in here. How could it not?\u201d\n\nIn a pub at Derrylin, a few miles up the road, Shane McBrien, a painter, seethed at the Democratic Unionist party for endorsing Johnson\u2019s plan. \u201cAny physical border will bring back bad memories. It\u2019s just going backwards.\u201d\n\nHis brother, Eugene, said a hard border would compound the fact that Brexit ignored the will of most Northern Ireland voters. \u201cThe north voted to remain. We\u2019re being tossed out of the EU. We\u2019ve no say.\u201d\n\nApplications for Irish passports from Britain and especially Northern Ireland continue to surge, reaching 85,517 by the end of August, outpacing the 79,513 for all of 2018, according to figures released last week.\n\nA complex web connects the economies on both sides of the border. Trade in goods is worth about \u00a35.2bn. About a third of Northern Ireland\u2019s goods and services exports are sold to the Republic, while about a quarter of its imports come from the south.\n\nDowning Street says electronic paperwork and a \u201cvery small number\u201d of physical inspections at traders\u2019 premises would limit disruption. Farmers and business leaders dispute that. Some warn of disaster.\n\nDiageo, which makes Guinness and Baileys, estimates a hard border could cost it \u00a31.3m, based on an estimate of an hour\u2019s delay for each of the 18,000 beer trucks that traverse the border each year. Smaller businesses with tight margins could face ruin. \u201cMy business and family need flexibility,\u201d said Gerard Crowe, a butcher in Ballyconnell, inside the Republic. \u201cBut what\u2019s coming won\u2019t give flexibility. We\u2019ve been through all that before and we don\u2019t want it back.\u201d\n\nDissident republicans have hailed Brexit \u2013 and specifically the prospect of a hard border \u2013 as a historic opportunity to revive an armed campaign. Public support for that seems negligible and attacks remain sporadic.\n\nBut even before Johnson unveiled his plan there was a sense of the police battening down the hatches. Last Monday Irish police established a new armed support unit in Cavan, which borders Fermanagh, to combat a surge in criminality and to prepare for Brexit.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland is planning to deploy hundreds of officers on Brexit-related operations and wants \u00a340m to recruit 300 additional officers. Simon Byrne, the PSNI chief constable, said he told the prime minister in a recent video call that his officers will not police any customs checkpoints or \u201cbe dragged\u201d into another type of policing. A bold assertion. Northern Ireland\u2019s history shows a hard border exerts a powerful drag.", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit proposals are filling those in rural County Fermanagh with dread and confusion", "authors": ["Rory Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51d3590cd0cb05d326e6339d154de7136f670423/0_166_8424_5052/master/8424.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3fc2acd14c1faf2c73959f25da714ce6", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
