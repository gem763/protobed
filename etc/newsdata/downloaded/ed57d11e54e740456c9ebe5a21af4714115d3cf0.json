Rhines, a convict scheduled to be executed in November 2019 in South Dakota for a 1992 fatal stabbing is taking issue with the state's choice of the drug that will take his life. He is asking the state to follow the law on lethal injections at the time he was sentenced to death in 1993 when a protocol of an ultra-short-acting lethal drug and a chemical paralytic were used. Rhines was convicted of killing 22-year-old Donnivan Schaeffer while burglarizing a doughnut shop.(South Dakota Department of Corrections via AP)\n\nSIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) \u2014 The state of South Dakota asked a judge Monday to reject an inmate's objection to the lethal drug scheduled for use in his execution.\n\nCharles Russell Rhines is scheduled to die next week for the 1992 fatal stabbing of a 22-year-old doughnut shop worker during a robbery. Rhines moved last week to block the execution by arguing that pentobarbital, commonly used to euthanize animals, doesn't act quickly enough. His lawyers argue that by using the drug, the state would be violating Rhines' right to choose his manner of execution and his right to due process.\n\nThe state countered that Rhines' argument is based on pentobarbital's performance in a low-dosage setting, and that it works quickly enough when given in high doses. The drug has been used in recent executions in Georgia, Missouri and Texas.\n\nThe state also argued that Rhines' objection could have been brought long ago. A South Dakota circuit court judge is scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday.\n\nPentobarbital was used last year when South Dakota executed Rodney Berget, who killed a prison guard during a 2011 escape attempt. Berget was pronounced dead 12 minutes after the lethal injection began, and a transcript released afterward said Berget asked after the injection was administered: \"Is it supposed to feel like that?\" That prompted a national group that studies capital punishment to call on the state to release more details about the drug used.\n\nRhines was sentenced to death for the 1992 killing of Donnivan Schaeffer, who was stabbed in the skull, stomach and back while Rhines was burglarizing the Rapid City doughnut shop where Schaeffer worked.\n\nRhines lost two other appeals to delay his execution last week. In those appeals, he argued that he should be able to meet with mental health experts to prepare a clemency application and that the state's execution policies don't follow the state's rule-making requirement. Rhines' attorney did not return a request for comment.\n\nAn exact date for Rhines' execution hasn't been announced.", "description": "The state of South Dakota asked a judge Monday to reject an inmate's objection to the lethal drug scheduled for use in his execution.
