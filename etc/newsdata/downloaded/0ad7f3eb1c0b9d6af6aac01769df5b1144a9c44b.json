(In addition to asking Joe Biden if he was losing his memory.) He\u2019s been using this issue as his calling card ever since he declared, staking out positions so far to the left that even the other woke candidates don\u2019t want to stand too close to him.\n\nBut it turns out it wasn\u2019t always this way. The Free Beacon has dug up some of Castro\u2019s golden oldies, focusing on his time as Mayor of San Antonio. Back in 2013, Castro was a big Obama supporter and was called before the House Judiciary Committee to testify on issues pertaining to border security and immigration enforcement. He was questioned by committee chair Bob Goodlatte (R., Va.) and sang a very different tune than the one you\u2019re hearing today.\n\n\u201cDo you think that interior enforcement should play a role to discourage future immigration by those not documented by making jobs to them unavailable? Should that be a part of that comprehensive immigration reform?\u201d Goodlatte asked. \u201cThat\u2019s a great question,\u201d Castro said. \u201cI do believe that enforcement, both in terms of active enforcement on our borders\u2014and under this administration there has been tremendous progress with regard to enforcement. In fact, the triggers in the 2007 proposal have just about all been met. But going forward, of course, enforcement is part of the conversation.\u201d \u201cBoth in terms of border security and interior security, comprehensive immigration reform gives us the opportunity to make this work better at every single juncture,\u201d he added later.\n\nA picture\u2019s worth a thousand words, so here\u2019s the video to help Julian stroll down memory lane with us.\n\nThis is fairly incredible and I can\u2019t help but think that some of the other candidates would be hitting him on this pretty heavily if he were polling anywhere north of zero percent. As things stand today he\u2019s just serving as a convenient tool for those who might stand a chance but don\u2019t want to be seen as slamming Joe Biden too hard.\n\nStill, this sort of reversal is more than just a mere flip-flop. Castro\u2019s current platform on immigration is as far left as one can go without offering to surrender our entire country to Mexico. He\u2019s called for decriminalizing illegal crossings, offering free healthcare and other benefits to illegal immigrants and even removing some existing sections of the border wall. When a conservative in a primary debate calls for extending border barriers, Castro is the equivalent of the Republican who demands in return that we build a moat and fill it with laser enabled sharks.\n\nBut back in 2013, he was all about no jobs for the invaders and better ways to get people locked up and then deported. Think about it for a moment. That was barely six years ago. We\u2019re not talking about some youthful person taking positions that later evolve with more life experience. Castro was already almost forty years old at that point and was the mayor of a major city.\n\nThat only leaves us with one conclusion. Either he was being a phony back then to suck up to Barack Obama or he\u2019s being a phony now to try to woo the furthest left wing of the party in the primary. Take your pick, but neither of these is a good look for him. Might want to pack it in and head back to Texas, Mr. Castro.", "description": "Those were the days", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/JulianCastro.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
