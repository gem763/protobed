I do\u2014I love you. I\u2019m the daughter of a father! But \u2026\u201d\n\nBy now I had watched enough of What the Constitution Means to Me to recognize this as an instance of what one armchair sociologist (me) calls the Ex Post Facto Trumpian Hand Wave. Everybody knows the pattern by now: a sincere opinion followed by an insincere contradiction meant to cancel it out. The president will issue some absurd and tasteless tweet\u2014telling, let\u2019s say, a quartet of congresswomen to go back to the countries they came from, which in most of their cases is the United States. And then, a day later, he will stand before a teleprompter and read a clarion call for national unity, regardless of race or creed or country of origin.\n\nIt\u2019s not convincing, but it\u2019s catching. By the time Schreck insisted she had no intention of vilifying men, she had already told us several revolting tales of male barbarity, with several more to come. Indeed, one of her chief insights into the Constitution is that it was written by men to protect the privileges of men from all persons who weren\u2019t men\u2014which, if true, certainly sounds to me like good grounds for vilification. But seriously, folks: \u201cI love men!\u201d She vilifies because she loves.\n\nThe set of What the Constitution Means to Me is a dystopian riff on an American Legion hall, with a desk and a podium and three walls covered in pressboard wood paneling and hung with black-and-white headshots of middle-aged guys in Legionnaire hats\u2014dozens of them, cheek by jowl. Schreck is surrounded, in other words, by the enemy, whom she loves. As a girl of 15, Schreck appeared in many such halls to give speeches about the Constitution. The prize money she won paid her way through college.\n\n\u201cA few years ago,\u201d she tells the audience, \u201cI was thinking about the Constitution [beat] for various reasons [meaningful glance].\u201d The ironic aside gets a good laugh; no group of New York theatergoers needs to be told why she\u2019s worried about the Constitution. They\u2019re worried too! She wonders why, as a girl, she loved the Constitution so passionately. \u201cBecause I did, I loved it,\u201d she adds, in what may be just another EPF Trumpian Hand Wave. By play\u2019s end, it\u2019s become clear that if the young Schreck did indeed love the Constitution, it\u2019s because she misunderstood it; and if her passion for the document has cooled as she\u2019s gotten older, it\u2019s because she\u2019s transcended her earlier misunderstanding to misunderstand it even more.\n\nSchreck\u2019s view of the Constitution is perhaps too dramatic. We should expect drama from a professional dramatist, needless to say, but how dramatic should we be? \u201cThe Constitution,\u201d she tells the audience, \u201ccan be thought of as a boiling pot in which we are thrown together in sizzling and steamy conflict to find out what it is we truly believe.\u201d", "description": "Heidi Schreck isn\u2019t a fan of America\u2019s founding charter\u2014which may be why her audiences are such big fans of hers.", "authors": ["Andrew Ferguson", "Staff Writer For"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/GettyImages_1134178092/facebook.jpg?1566228625"}
