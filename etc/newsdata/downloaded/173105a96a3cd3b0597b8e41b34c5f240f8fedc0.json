Taco Bell said all of its affected locations confirmed by Monday that they had thrown out the meat, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture said \u201cmay be contaminated with extraneous materials, specifically metal shavings.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs soon as we received the first consumer complaint, we immediately acted to remove the product from the affected restaurants and proactively worked with the supplier to inform the USDA of our steps to protect our guests,\u201d Julie Masino, Taco Bell\u2019s North America president, said in the statement.\n\nTaco Bell\u2019s meat came from Kenosha Beef International, a Columbus, Ohio, packing plant that distributed the product in cases containing eight five-pound plastic bags marked for use in tacos and burritos, the USDA said. The company shipped the meat to distribution centers in Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Virginia, which then sent it to Taco Bell locations.\n\nKenosha told the USDA on Saturday that it had received three customer complaints.\n\n\u201cThere have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products,\u201d the USDA said.\n\nNeither Taco Bell nor the USDA speculated on how metal shavings got into food.\n\nThe recall follows Taco Bell\u2019s July tortilla shortage, which, although short-lived, spurred complaints on social media from irked customers.", "description": "The fast food chain said it realized there was an issue with its seasoned beef when a customer reported finding a metal shaving in food.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da5f3222100001a0e3471ea.jpeg?cache=8ypecde82j&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
