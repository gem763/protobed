In 1990, he was convicted of one count of aggravated sodomy and one count of attempting to commit rape in Georgia.\n\nHe was also convicted of voyeurism in South Carolina in 1989.\n\nOther sexual assault victims and witnesses have severed their attackers\u2019 private parts out of self-defense.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, a Ukrainian man severed an alleged rapist\u2019s penis after he witnessed him allegedly attacking his wife, the New York Post reported. The spouse was sentenced to house arrest for causing grievous bodily harm.", "description": "A registered sex offender is out on bond after an alleged sexual assault where a woman severed the suspect's penis out of self-defense.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Dennis-Glenn-Slaton-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
