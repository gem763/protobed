It\u2019s really hard to understand what it\u2019s like. I know what it seems like it should be, but it\u2019s a very different thing.\u201d\n\nMarkle said she and her husband Prince Harry have had conversations about being in the spotlight and all the negativity that comes with it.\n\n\u201cI have said for a long time to H, that\u2019s what I call him, \u2018It\u2019s not enough to just survive something,\u2019\u201d said Markle. \u201c\u2019That\u2019s not the point of life. You have to thrive. You have got to feel happy.\u2019 I really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a \u2018stiff upper life.\u2019 I really tried, but I think that what that does internally is probably really damaging.\u201d\n\nThe royal went on to tell Bradby she would be more understanding about the scrutiny if it were fair.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY SHARE THROWBACK PHOTO FROM THEIR WEDDING DAY\n\nPRINCE HARRY SAYS MOM PRINCESS DIANA'S DEATH IS A 'WOUND THAT FESTERS'\n\n\u201cI never thought that this would be easy, but I thought it would be fair,\u201d said Markle. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the part that\u2019s really hard to reconcile.\u201d\n\nMarkle said before she tied the knot with Harry, 35, some of her friends warned her that becoming a member of the royal family would mean being under the constant glare of the public spotlight and losing your privacy.\n\n\u201cIn all fairness, I had no idea, which probably sounds difficult to understand and hear,\u201d said Markle. \u201cBut when I first met my now-husband, my friends were really happy because I was so happy, but my British friends said to me, \u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019s great but you shouldn\u2019t do it because the British tabloids will destroy your life.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I, very naively \u2014 I\u2019m American,\u201d continued Markle. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that there \u2014 [I said], \u2018What are you talking about? That doesn\u2019t make any sense. I\u2019m not in any tabloids.\u2019 I didn\u2019t get it. So it\u2019s been, yeah, it\u2019s been complicated.\u201d\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE REVEALS STRUGGLES OF BEING A MOM IN THE PUBLIC EYE: \u2018NOT MANY PEOPLE HAVE ASKED IF I\u2019M OK\u2019\n\nPRINCE HARRY BREAKS DOWN TALKING ABOUT ANXIETIES OF PARENTHOOD, MEGHAN MARKLE'S PREGNANCY\n\nMarkle also pointed out it\u2019s been frustrating to see her name \u2014 along with her family\u2019s \u2014 in headlines concerning stories she stressed just aren\u2019t true.\n\n\u201cIf things are fair, that completely tracks for me if things are fair,\u201d said Markle. \u201cIf I do something wrong I\u2019d be the first one to go, \u2018Oh my gosh, I\u2019m so sorry. I would never do that,\u2019 but when people are saying things that are just untrue and they\u2019re being told they\u2019re untrue but they\u2019re allowed to still say them, I don\u2019t know anybody in the world who would feel that that\u2019s OK. And that\u2019s different than just scrutiny. That\u2019s, what would you call that? That\u2019s a different beast. It\u2019s really a different beast.\u201d\n\nIn a clip previously released by ITV on Friday, Markle got candid with Bradby about the negative attention she has received from the media during her pregnancy and first months with Archie, who was born in May.\n\n\u201cAny woman, especially when they\u2019re pregnant, you\u2019re really vulnerable, and so that was made really challenging,\u201d said the 38-year-old. \u201cAnd then when you have a newborn, you know. ... and especially as a woman, it\u2019s a lot.\u201d\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY SHARE SWEET MOMENT WITH SON ARCHIE IN UPCOMING DOCUMENTARY\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY CONSIDERING MOVING TO CANADA: SOURCE\n\n\u201cSo you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed,\u201d continued Markle while holding back tears. \u201cIt\u2019s um\u2026 yeah. I guess, also thank you for asking because not many people have asked if I\u2019m OK. But it\u2019s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nWhen Bradby asked if it \u201cwould be fair\u201d to say that she\u2019s \u201cnot really OK, as in it\u2019s really been a struggle,\u201d Markle responded, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nStill, Markle said Harry and their son have helped get through tough times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d she said. \u201cThe good thing is that I\u2019ve got my baby and I\u2019ve got my husband and they\u2019re the best.\u201d\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE'S DAD REVEALS WHY HE SHARED HER PRIVATE LETTER: 'I HAVE TO DEFEND MYSELF'\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE SUES BRITISH TABLOID, PRINCE HARRY SPEAKS OUT: 'MY DEEPEST FEAR IS HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF'\n\nIn the documentary, Harry also spoke out against the British tabloids for the \u201cruthless\u201d treatment Markle has received \u201cover the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, part of this job and part of any job, like everybody, means putting on a brave face and turning a cheek to a lot of the stuff,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut again, for me and my wife, of course, there\u2019s a lot of stuff that hurts \u2014 especially when the majority of it is untrue.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll we need to do is focus on being real, focus on being the people we are and standing up for what we believe in,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI will not be bullied into carrying a game that killed my mom.\u201d", "description": "Meghan Markle admitted she wasn\u2019t prepared for the intense media scrutiny that awaited her after marrying into the British royal family.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/19/694940094001_6096033185001_6096034687001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
