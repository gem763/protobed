A recession would wipe out the budget surplus that has propelled new spending on social services in California, and threaten Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election bid in 2020.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Trump has seen California as a perfect foil, a liberal haven rife with problems \u2014 homelessness, income inequality, gun violence \u2014 he can use to taunt his opponents and energize his base. The problems Mr. Trump cites are real: For all of California\u2019s liberal politics and its rhetoric of tolerance and diversity, the state has the highest poverty rate in the nation and there are more homeless people in California than anywhere else in the country.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump was in Japan over the summer for the G20 summit, he drew a contrast between the cleanliness of Japanese cities and the filth and the number of homeless people on the streets of San Francisco and Los Angeles, saying it was a problem that started two years ago even though it has been an issue that has confounded generations of California leaders.\n\nThis week, a delegation of White House aides visited Los Angeles to see the homeless problem up close, and an article in The Washington Post suggested the administration might try to clear the streets of the homeless and move them to federal facilities.", "description": "California Democrats have been energized by a wave of anti-Trump sentiment to enact a sweeping liberal agenda that in almost every way offers a counternarrative to Trump administration policies.", "authors": ["Tim Arango", "Thomas Fuller", "Jose A.
