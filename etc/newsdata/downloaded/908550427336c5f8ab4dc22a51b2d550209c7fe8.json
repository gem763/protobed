Mitt Romney (R-UT) said in an interview published on Monday that he is undecided on support for impeaching President Donald Trump and characterized the behind-closed-doors proceeding as \u201cconfidential.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am making sure that I do everything I can to be unbiased and to keep an open mind,\u201d Romney said in a USA Today report. \u201cI also want to see what the facts of the case are.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd at this stage the investigation is being done in a confidential setting so I don\u2019t know the full array of facts but so I will study the law and the facts and on that basis make an informed judgment consistent with Constitutional duties,\u201d Romney said.\n\nUSA Today painted a glowing picture of Romney, who \u201chas a lot on his mind these days \u2014 and he says he\u2019s feeling freer to open up,\u201d including answering the media outlet\u2019s questions in the \u201clightly edited\u201d transcript it published.\n\nUSA Today also links to a cover story about the Q&A entitled: \u201cMitt Romney: a solitary GOP voice battling Trump for the soul of the Republican Party\u201d\n\nThe outlet asked Romney about his legacy:\n\nI\u2019m driven by following the oath of office and doing what I think is right. There\u2019s a song in my church called \u2018Do What is Right.\u2019 And the first line is \u2018Do what is right. Let the consequence follow.\u2019 I try and do what I think is right. And I\u2019m not going to worry so much about, about the political consequence, or praise or lack thereof. And I hope that my kids down the road will say \u2018Yeah, you know our dad, our grandfather our great-grandfather was a person of integrity and honored his oath of office.\u2019\n\nThe outlet asked if he would vote for Trump in the next election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be weighing in on endorsements or who I would vote for in the presidential campaign,\u201d Romney said.\n\nUSA Today also asked Romney if Trump was worried about his criticism of the president and whether he feels more willing to speak out going forward.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s worried about me, and I certainly don\u2019t think he should be,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI\u2019m not running for national office again. I\u2019ve had my two strikes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not on my way up. I\u2019ve had my life,\u201d Romney said. \u201cMy career, my family, my faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose define who I am,\u201d Romney said. \u201cAnd so I\u2019m really entirely free emotionally to do entirely what I believe is absolutely right. And I said to my kids: \u2018My future is behind me.\u2019\u201d\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "Sen.
