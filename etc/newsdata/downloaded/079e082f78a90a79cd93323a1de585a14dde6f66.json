When used judiciously, it adds just the right amount of raspberry and blackberry, as well as a nice swirl of deep violet. These dark, seductive qualities make it perfect for a slightly spooky, but not overly themed adult beverage.\n\nOne of my favourite Cr\u00e8me Yvette cocktails is the Defender, named after some guy\u2019s yacht. (I find ships of all kinds to be inherently spooky, especially yachts owned by rich dudes. Sinister things happen on rich dudes\u2019 yachts.)\n\nThe Defender is basically a 50/50 martini, where the gin is Old Tom and the vermouth is Italian\u2014I used Carpano Antica Formula, which is honestly good enough to sip over ice. Those two, plus a splash of Cr\u00e8me Yvette, creates a aperitif-style cocktail with fruity and herbal flavours, perfect for enjoying with or without fun-size candy bars. I used a little more Cr\u00e8me Yvette than the traditional recipe, and I urge you to follow my lead. To make the Defender, you will need:\n\n45mL Old Tom gin\n\n45mL Carpano Antica Formula (or another sweet Italian vermouth)\n\n8mL Cr\u00e8me Yvette\n\nAdd everything to a stirring glass filled with ice and stir until the glass becomes very cold. Strain into a coupe glass and sip while handing out candy, watching horror movies, or inhaling a pile of smol candy bars.", "description": "If you search the phrase \u201cHalloween cocktails,\u201d you will find many recipes for green or purple cocktails with names like \u201cwitch\u2019s brew\u201d or \u201cwitch\u2019s heart,\u201d or \u201cmelted witch.\u201d Most of these cocktails are overly sweet, and few of them enticing....", "authors": ["Ronelle Welton", "Bill Nimorakiotakis", "Chris Jager"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/zfykpkibgekkum6ebsnx.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
