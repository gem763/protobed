(AP) - Von Miller has dealt with sack droughts before, but never this early in the season.\n\n\u201cI always get them at the end of the year,\u201d Miller told The Associated Press following his unusually somber weekly appearance at the podium Wednesday. \u201cI guess it bothers you a little bit more at the beginning of the year because the season\u2019s just starting and you want to get in the race, you want to get ahead of the race.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos (0-2) have yet to register a sack or a takeaway under Vic Fangio, who designed the NFL\u2019s best defense in Chicago the last few seasons before earning his first head coaching job this year in Denver.\n\nFangio used his introductory news conference to challenge Miller, with his 98 career sacks and Super Bowl MVP award, to be even better.\n\nMiller quickly accepted the challenge.\n\nAlthough he\u2019s dropping into coverage at different times, Miller told the AP that any notion his creativity is crimped under Fangio\u2019s system is erroneous. He said he still has the freedom to freelance to try to wreck game plans like he did under John Fox, Gary Kubiak and Vance Joseph.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not asking me to do nothing that I haven\u2019t done before in previous years,\u201d Miller said.\n\nHe added that he has his full repertoire of moves available like the duck to the inside with defensive end Derek Wolfe covering for him by containing the edge.\n\n\u201cYeah, I feel I can slip inside more now,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI\u2019m doing the exact stuff that I was doing in previous years. It\u2019s just at different moments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a different system.\u201d\n\nThe sackless streak could end this weekend when the Broncos visit the Green Bay Packers (2-0), whose O-line has allowed seven sacks of Aaron Rodgers so far.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just collapsing the pocket on him,\u201d said Bradley Chubb, Miller\u2019s pass-rushing partner. \u201cAaron is one of those guys that can make plays with his feet and likes to let routes develop downfield while he\u2019s running around. \u2026 That\u2019s our main goal, just keep him in the pocket and allow our coverage to be there and hopefully we get there for the sack.\u201d\n\nBeing without a sack or a takeaway makes Denver\u2019s defense even more dangerous in Packers first-year coach Matt LaFleur\u2019s view.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to try to scheme some stuff up, as well, and those guys are probably champing at the bit to hit home on the quarterback,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cOn the flip side of it, we\u2019ve probably given up too many sacks, so I know those guys are going to see an opportunity in front of them and we know where to get their best shot.\u201d\n\nFangio said he won\u2019t do anything special schematically to spring Miller and Chubb for their first sacks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so, not to the degree you\u2019re alluding to,\u201d Fangio said.\n\nFangio said he\u2019s not overly concerned about the pass rush\u2019s slow start because the Raiders and Bears both ran the ball more than they threw it and the Broncos\u2019 biggest lead so far is three points.\n\nLaFleur said the common denominator with Oakland and Chicago was they made sure to \u201cget the ball out fast. You\u2019re always thinking about that when you\u2019ve got two of the premier pass rushers in the National Football League in Bradley Chubb and Von Miller.\u201d\n\nMiller, who has faced his usual dose of double-teams and chippers, has never entered Week 3 still seeking his first sack. Usually, it\u2019s December before he has a sackless streak, when the wear and tear of the season starts to take its toll and footing gets trickier.\n\n\u201cI always get droughts at the end of the year,\u201d Miller said as he sat alone at a table by his locker, looking up from his phone.\n\nOver his career, Miller has averaged .83 sacks a game in September, .95 in October, 1.0 in November and just half a sack in December.\n\nForty-six times in his 122 career games he\u2019s been held without a sack and 20 of those have come in December (or the regular season finale in early January). By contrast, he has 10 sackless games in September and eight each in October and November.\n\nMiller said he\u2019s more bothered by the Broncos\u2019 0-2 record than by their lack of sacks, which he always says comes in bunches.\n\nHe takes little solace in that, though, as he tries to break out of his slump.\n\n\u201cI grind harder. I just double down,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI put a little bit more into it, a little bit more into film, a little bit more into everything.\n\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t guarantee that it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton ___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Von Miller has dealt with sack droughts before, but never this early in the season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/bears_broncos_football_85411_c0-166-3974-2483_s1770x1032.jpg?777ce8afb39540d8b90db4bec8b0fa1efb197a66", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
