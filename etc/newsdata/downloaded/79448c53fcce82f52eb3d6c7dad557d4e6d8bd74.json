Johnny Isakson\u2019s (R-GA) office told Breitbart News that the senator wants to ensure that the impeachment inquiry remains a \u201cfair process.\u201d\n\nThe three Republican senators that have yet to back the impeachment resolution are Sens. Mitt Romney (R-UT), Lisa Murkowski (R-UT), and Susan Collins (R-ME).\n\nEven though these senators have yet to cosponsor the resolution, this does not mean that they may not cosponsor the resolution in the future or vote for the bill should it come to the Senate floor for a vote.\n\nSen. Murkowski\u2019s office told Breitbart News that the senator has yet to review the Graham resolution.\n\nSens. Romney and Collins did not respond to a request for comment from Breitbart News.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 fight against the House Democrats\u2019 secretive impeachment inquiry practices has quickly become a rallying cry for the GOP.\n\nGraham announced during a press conference Thursday that his and McConnell\u2019s resolution gained 41 cosponsors. Now, the resolution nearly has the backing of the entire Senate Republican conference.\n\nConservative activist groups have also backed the bill. The Club for Growth \u201ckey voted\u201d the Graham-McConnell resolution, and the Tea Party Patriots Honorary Chairman Jenny Beth Martin praised McConnell\u2019s bill.\n\nSenators have backed the resolution Friday, decrying the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry as \u201cone-sided.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have co-sponsored the Graham resolution because in an impeachment process, the American people above all expect it to be fair,\u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) said in a statement Friday, announcing his support for the Graham-McConnell bill. Alexander added:\n\nHouse Democrats might want to stop and take a look at how the House Democratic majority bent over backwards to include Republicans and the President\u2019s representatives in the 1974 Nixon impeachment, and compare that with the one-sided, largely secret inquiry they are conducting today.\n\nSen. Graham said Thursday that the \u201cgrowing\u201d list of Republican senators backing the bill shows that the GOP is fighting back.", "description": "Three Republican senators have yet to back a resolution to condemn House Democrats' secret, closed-door impeachment inquiry practices.", "authors": ["Sean Moran"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/susan-collins-mitt-romney-lisa-murkowski-2-getty-ap-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
