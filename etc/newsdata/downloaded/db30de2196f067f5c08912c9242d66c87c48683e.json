A smaller majority, 53 percent, said Trump\u2019s actions appeared to be an effort to damage Biden politically rather than a sincere effort to expose wrongdoing.\n\nHalf of voters also said they believe the whistleblower filed the complaint in good faith to expose a real abuse of power, while the other half agreed with the characterization that the anonymous member of the intelligence community was \u201cplaying politics to hurt Trump.\u201d\n\nThe intelligence community inspector general found that the whistleblower exhibited \u201carguable political bias\u201d but said the allegations included in his complaint were nevertheless worthy of investigation.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "U.S. voters are split on the question of whether President Trump committed an impeachable offense in asking Ukraine's president to help his administration investigate Joe Biden, the 2020 Democratic presidential frontrunner.Fifty percent of Americans said they think Trump's request to Ukraine", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/u7wARHmQRBhVs1HdDWYQLA--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/5efeb47568191c2a05d6718b1c479378", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
