Photo by China Daily\n\nAmid the escalating violence in Hong Kong, it's time for moderate protesters \u2014 the majority of people taking to the streets \u2014 to draw a line with the radicals resorting to violence, a local political commentator said on Tuesday.\n\nThis is the most effective way to break the current impasse and help end the incessant violence, Paul Yeung, research officer of local think tank, the One Country Two Systems Research Institute, told China Daily.\n\nHe noted that after more than four months of turmoil, many moderate protesters have been disappointed with the radicals.\n\n\"In the beginning, they believed that a certain degree of violence would help improve the situation. But, the current situation has proved that things are not getting better, said Yeung. \"They're getting out of control.\"\n\nRadical protesters have escalated the violence in the past few months with excessive attacks on police officers and indiscriminate assaults on residents. A growing number of people have condemned violent behavior, including some opposition lawmakers.\n\nIn an recent interview, Jeremy Tam Man-ho of the Civic Party said he was \"saddened\" by such violent conduct and urged rioters to consider more about public safety.\n\nCalling himself a \"moderate demonstrator\", Tam said no one is willing to see violence, especially extreme acts such as throwing gasoline bombs that could be life-threatening.\n\nYeung reckoned it's about time moderate protesters stand out and say no to violence. \"Their change of attitude will effectively help bring the situation under control.\"\n\nWays to sap their morale\n\nModerate groups have been offering much support to the radicals, whether in terms of materials or morale, Yeung said. By breaking off with the radicals or weakening such support, it will be increasingly difficult for rioters to carry out large-scale campaigns, he believes.\n\nIf they do so, some radicals who are worried about being isolated may also follow suit and stop resorting to violence, Yeung said.\n\nHe called for joint efforts by residents to end the violence completely and help restore order in the community. \"We all love Hong Kong. We all want a better Hong Kong in future. So, we have to unite and work together to rebuild Hong Kong,\" he said.", "description": "Amid the escalating violence in Hong Kong, it's time for moderate protesters \u2014 the majority of people taking to the streets \u2014 to draw a line with the radicals resorting to violence, a local political commentator said on Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/16/5da66ed3a310cf3e97a16435.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
