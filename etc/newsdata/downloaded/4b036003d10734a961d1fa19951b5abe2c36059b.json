We, at House of Seafood, hope to serve each of you better and thank you for all the feedback,\u201d he added.\n\nThe live crab claw machine was widely criticized after a promotional video was posted Tuesday to lifestyle site SHOUT.\n\nThe Society for the Prevention of Animal Cruelty yesterday urged the public not to use the machine and said it had reported the restaurant to the NParks\u2019 Animal & Veterinary Service. Other animal welfare groups including the Animal Concerns Research and Education also called the restaurant out online for \u201ccruelty.\u201d\n\nFor S$5, people could to try and catch live Sri Lankan crabs from the machine located outside the House of Seafood restaurant in Punggol. Those hapless crustaceans pried free without being dropped, dropped and dropped were then cooked in either black pepper sauce, salted egg sauce, chili or with bee hoon noodles, according to the promotional. Each crab weighs 500 grams to 800 grams.\n\nNg told Coconuts Singapore yesterday that the S$5,000 machine was designed to prevent the crabs from experiencing any pain.\n\nThe opening on the bottom left of the claw machine, where customers claimed the little scramblers, was cushioned to support the animal\u2019s fall, while the claws were wrapped in plastic covering to soften their grip.\n\nNg said using a machine to claw the animals out and on their way to the frying pan was about teaching people to \u201clove them.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m sorry to all animal caregivers. We did not intend to use animals as play things \u2026 we clean the game machine every day and let them survive in a good environment,\u201d he said. \u201cMany children in restaurants like crabs but dare not touch it. I hope that in this way, more people would understand crabs better and love them.\u201d\n\nNg also said there was an educational reason behind the machine \u2013 educating the public on how to identify male and female crabs.\n\nLive crab claw machines can also be found at the restaurant\u2019s two outlets in China. But there have been no complaints there, he said.\n\nIf NParks wishes the machine be removed, Ng said he would respect its decision.\n\nNParks had not responded to Coconuts Singapore\u2019s inquiries as of publication time.\n\nRelated stories:\n\nSingapore restaurant accused of cruelty over live crab claw machine, owner says no pain involved\n\nThis article, Singapore restaurant \u2018sorry\u2019 for crab-claw machine slammed as cruel, originally appeared on Coconuts, Asia's leading alternative media company.
