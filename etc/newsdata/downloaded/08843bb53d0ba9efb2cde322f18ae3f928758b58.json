Over and over again \u2014 eight times, in fact, if you count her verbal and written responses \u2014 teenage Marie (Kaitlyn Dever of Booksmart) has to retell the story of her rape, the complete and total violation of her home and body. She repeats the story so many times that it brands itself on your brain as this first episode unfolds, as you see how plainly she describes the events versus how graphically they unspool in her mind. \u201cWe need you to tell us what happened\u201d becomes the sick, arrhythmic beating heart of this entirely necessary and mesmerizing new show.\n\nSo here\u2019s what Marie says happened. She was talking to her former boyfriend, now friend, Conner on the phone late at night. Around 4 a.m., she went to sleep but must have forgotten to lock the sliding door to her first-floor apartment at the Oakdale, Washington, complex she lives in with other at-risk youths. Suddenly, she was awakened by a man standing over her bed brandishing a knife and threatening to kill her if she screamed. He took a blindfold from his backpack, unlaced a pair of her own shoes, and then tied her wrists with the laces. He also took out a condom, rolled it on, and raped her \u2014 vaginally, not anally, though she can only say \u201cnot his fingers\u201d the first time she\u2019s asked. Then he put something on her stomach (she doesn\u2019t know what), took a picture using a flash, and exited the same way he came in. She untied herself and then called Judith (Elizabeth Marvel), her former foster mom, or maybe she called Judith first, she doesn\u2019t precisely recall. Who would?\n\nWhat we see in the flashbacks that accompany her voice are all the tiny but indelible bits that Marie never explains. How she pants, helpless and face-down on her bed. The way her rapist pinches her hips as he moves on top of her. The numb desperation on her face as she arches her back and clumsily cuts the laces her from own wrists with scissors from the kitchen drawer. Later, when the detectives grill Marie over whether she\u2019s telling the entire story, these moments crept back into my mind. Of course she isn\u2019t sharing absolutely everything \u2014 less than an hour after that kind of attack, who could even determine what \u201ceverything\u201d really is? Policework demands all the details up front, a geyser of tactile horror \u2014 but sensitivity requires discretion, trust, the slow unspooling of a narrative that may be knotted into a hangman\u2019s noose inside a victim\u2019s mind.\n\nThis entire first episode of Unbelievable \u2014 which takes place over a mere couple of days \u2014 is an exercise in sending steam out your ears like an infuriated cartoon character. When we meet Marie, huddled under a down comforter with only a former foster mother there to offer support, she\u2019s immediately interrogated by not one, not two, but three men. They\u2019re all kindly and gentle, but it\u2019s patently obvious to us (though not them) that barging in the door and immediately needling a rape victim for precise details as they stand over her might not be the most victim-centric approach. \u201cHere they come, here comes help,\u201d Judith assures Marie as that first officer comes through the door. But by the end of the episode, it\u2019s clear that the police haven\u2019t offered a single bit of help to Marie.\n\nFor that matter, neither does the staff of the hospital she\u2019s brought to for a rape kit and examination. The nurse conducting the exam offers what she must view as adequate explanations of the multitude of procedures and swabs she\u2019s poking into Marie\u2019s already traumatized body (four of her vagina, four of her rectum, four of \u201cthe area in-between\u201d, and my stomach was in my mouth). But no specialized advocate joins her side. No reassuring hand squeezes her shoulder. Nobody flat out asks what exactly the thing is that she needs. Imagine a stranger covering your vagina in dye and then flashing a giant light on it to determine what areas are \u201cdamaged tissue,\u201d while your knees are floating up in the air and you\u2019re imagining that the last time someone touched you there it was to brutally rape you. Just imagine that.\n\nAnd the process is interminable \u2014 photo after photo, followed by needles, jabs, and more questions. I kept imagining, for some reason, Amanda Knox as she sat in the police station after her arrest for her roommate Meredith Kercher\u2019s murder. She cartwheeled, the tabloids reported. She even \u2014 gasp \u2014 stretched. In serious situations, young women, it seems, are meant to grow hysterical or maintain perfect seriousness. Actually, it seems that no matter what young women do in such situations, they\u2019re deemed, as Judith later puts it to the detective, \u201coff.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all distressingly clinical and dry \u2014 nearly 30 minutes of procedure and questioning. And yet it\u2019s also some of the most moving television I\u2019ve seen in years. Finally, a sexual-assault procedural that doesn\u2019t treat the victims as if catching the perpetrator is the definitive end to any emotional struggles they might have, that whisks police out of their role as saviors, that drills down on the blank space left behind when first responders \u2014 who, in this instance, tell Maria ad nauseam that it\u2019s their job to \u201ckeep people safe\u201d but offer zero sense of safety in their actions \u2014 are crime-solving automatons.\n\nUnbelievable doesn\u2019t stop there in its indictments of how bystanders handle the rape of a friend or loved one. After Marie leaves the hospital and spends the night with her friend and fellow Oakdale dweller Amelia, two of her former foster mothers step in to offer various sympathies and support. Judith, whom Marie most recently lived with, manages to subtly chastise Marie in her first breath, telling her she\u2019d have made her some tea, but there isn\u2019t any, as if Marie has already begun failing independent adulthood by not stocking PG Tips. Colleen is a warmer presence, breaking down in tears as she tells her husband about the rape, pulling Marie into her chest. But she is determined that Marie\u2019s trauma look and sound like what she expects. Marie\u2019s demand for the exact same sheets she already owned \u2014 \u201cgreen with little daisies\u201d \u2014 is most likely an attempt to restructure her life exactly as it looked before the attack, to move past it in a rush. (\u201cIf I were you, I would never want to see those sheets again,\u201d Colleen yells, unable to see that, well, she isn\u2019t Marie.) That\u2019s why later, in the new apartment the complex moves her into, when she pins up her oceanic poster and rehangs the photos of her friends, they also go in the same exact spots they once hung. Marie doesn\u2019t want to live in the reality of her rape.\n\nWhich is what drives Judith, in a logic-twisting bit of verbal gymnastics, to invite over Detective Parker (Eric Lange, whom you\u2019ve seen in a million shows like Lost, Narcos, The Bridge, and The Man in the High Castle, but you have probably never been able to name before this) and offer him what she calls \u201ccontext\u201d about Marie\u2019s upbringing and recent attention-seeking behavior. Her father, we learn, was never in the picture, while her mother\u2019s boyfriends were too often in the picture. The specifics are slim, but in general, this was not the story of a happy childhood. Yet Judith \u2014 also, we learn, a victim of sexual assault \u2014 slowly unfolds her internal debates onto the table. First, with the stories of Marie dancing on a table and (rather funnily, actually) blowing out the candles at a small child\u2019s birthday. Then she begins to interrogate Marie\u2019s reactions to the rape (\u201cThe whole thing felt off\u201d), until finally she picks apart the details, wondering if a shoelace would even hold her, and offers an alternative scenario: Perhaps Marie sent someone naked photos of her and is using this tale as cover lest the photos make their way into the world. It\u2019s cruelty in the guise of kindness, but there\u2019s plenty of blame to go around.\n\nInherent in Unbelievable\u2019s premise is that, well, Marie\u2019s story is unbelievable. Though not for any of the reasons we so commonly associate with disbelieved women. Instead, it\u2019s the simple fact that Marie is already a victim that makes detectives so eager to dismiss her story. She\u2019s poor and young and doesn\u2019t have a stream of lawyers sitting next to her in the interrogation room. Marie has such a long history of abuse (the only specific that we learn is that her parents fed her dog food, a crime of neglect so utterly contemptuous of human life that I shuddered) that for two male detectives, it\u2019s far easier to believe that she would see more stories of abuse as an attention-seeking tactic.\n\nThose final scenes, of the detectives slowly wearing Marie down into a false admission of a made-up rape, are brilliant in the multitude of ways they eff it up to bits. First the detectives come at Marie with her family-services file, brandishing sympathy as a sword. \u201cWe don\u2019t think you\u2019re a bad person,\u201d they tell her, implying (while she shakes and squirms with unrelenting discomfort) that she has, however, done a bad thing. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been cared for or protected,\u201d they say without a hint of awareness. Eventually, Marie lands in the place they\u2019ve been guiding her to and \u201cadmits\u201d that she made the whole story up.\n\nThen, when she stutters through a variety of potential ideas \u2014 that she dreamed the rape and it felt real, that she was hypnotized \u2014 that sympathy converts into guilt and shaming. \u201cThis is a waste of our time,\u201d the detectives say to berate her. \u201cWhat do you think should happen to someone who would lie about something like this?\u201d Until, finally, after taking back her initial statement and then \u201cadmitting,\u201d again, that she made up the tale, Marie has been reduced in just a few days\u2019 time from a young woman whom the police have come to \u201chelp\u201d to a girl clinging to the side of a bridge, perhaps seconds from jumping.\n\nThe two detectives \u2014 old white balding men \u2014 are surely at home shaking their heads at the damaged young lady who wasted their days with her false reports and patting themselves on the back for responding with such compassion. Meanwhile, the young woman they\u2019re meant to be protecting is dangling, physically and emotionally.", "description": "A clinical but moving premiere offers a series of indictments of how first responders and bystanders mishandle rape victims.
