But for the filmmaker Ken Burns, the answer is clear.\n\n\u201cThe fact somebody has walked into country music, that is not of the color that people presume the people of country music are, and just said, \u2018I\u2019m home\u2019 \u2014 that is great,\u201d Burns said in a Pitchfork video in June. \u201cThis is where we need to go.\u201d\n\nBurns\u2019 new 16-hour documentary series, Country Music, arrives Sept. 15 on PBS, and covers a century of the genre with the same painstaking attention to detail seen in his other award-winning series like Baseball and The Vietnam War. He uses archival footage, photographs and extensive interviews to delve into the breakthroughs, tragedies and joys of Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson and many more familiar names.\n\nBut one of the series\u2019 central tenets is that country music has always been home to African-American artists. Burns shows that, just like in rock, jazz and pop, every facet of country \u2014 from its instrumentation to repertoire to vocal and instrumental techniques \u2014 is indebted to African and African-American traditions, but commercial decisions by white industry executives led to their exclusion from the genre for decades.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

But the instrument is a descendant of West African lutes, made from gourds, that were brought to America by slaves and which became a central part of slave music and culture in the South. Soon, the instrument was standardized, appropriated and spread to white audiences through minstrel and blackface shows \u2014 which deeply informed the rise of hillbilly music, a term that would later be rebranded as \u201ccountry music.\u201d (The blackface performer Emmett Miller\u2019s \u201cLovesick Blues,\u201d for example, inspired Hank Williams\u2019 own rendition of the song, which is still one of the most beloved songs in country history.) White banjo innovators like Earl Scruggs and David Akeman later made the instrument integral to the genre\u2019s DNA, and black musicians mostly abandoned the instrument.\n\nMany of the songs that early hillbilly artists played were likewise inherited and adapted from black sources \u2014 like slave spirituals, field songs, religious hymnals or the works of professional black songwriters. In Country Music, Burns traces how \u201cWhen the World is On Fire,\u201d a hymn arranged by a black minister, was turned into the Carter Family\u2019s 1928 hit \u201cLittle Darling, Pal of Mine\u201d \u2014 which was then turned into Woody Guthrie\u2019s quintessential \u201cThis Land is Your Land.\u201d Meanwhile, \u201cCarry Me Back to Old Virginny\u201d was written by James A. Bland, a black New Yorker who would hardly have found himself welcome in parts of Virginia had he still been alive in 1940, when it was named the official state song.\n\nWhile the South remained deeply segregated in the \u201820s and \u201830s, black and white musicians frequently engaged in musical collaboration, even appearing on many recordings together. Country Music details the collaboration between Jimmie Rodgers and Louis Armstrong on 1929\u2019s \u201cBlue Yodel Number 9.\u201d On that song, the \u201cFather of Country Music\u201d yodels and sings the tale of a Tennessee hustler, while Satchmo seamlessly fills the space with jaunty blues licks. Despite the nearly diametrically opposed genre labels they carried, it\u2019s clear that they were pulling from a shared musical tradition.\n\nAnd that collaboration was just the tip of the iceberg, according to Patrick Huber, a history professor at Missouri University of Science and Technology. In his 2013 essay \u201cBlack Hillbillies: African American Musicians on Old-Time Records, 1924-1932,\u201d he details the startling diversity of hillbilly music, which featured a higher frequency of integrated sessions than any other genre except vaudeville blues. Nearly 50 African-American singers and musicians, he writes, appeared on commercial hillbilly records between those years \u2014 because the music was not a white agrarian tradition, but a fluid phenomenon passed back and forth between the races.\n\n\u201cAs a result of exchanges and borrowing and theft and parody, southern music pre-World War I was fundamentally multicultural,\u201d Huber told TIME.\n\nBut as hillbilly music became a commercial product in the 1920s, record labels began dividing their releases into \u201chillbilly records\u201d and \u201crace records,\u201d under the presumption that consumers bought music according to their race. Many of the black performers on hillbilly records went uncredited or were even scrubbed from marketing images in favor of white stand-ins. The genre was quickly positioned as an authentic return to the music of the idyllic rural white Mountain South, in direct opposition to the black \u201cmodern dance music\u201d of the era.\n\nThis marketing ploy meant that many black artists were pushed to the margins of country music, even if they remained influential behind the scenes. Lesley Riddle, a black guitar player, helped A.P. Carter of the Carter Family hone his repertoire of mountain songs and greatly influenced the fingerpicking guitar style of Maybelle Carter, who is considered one of the most influential guitarists of all time. Rufus \u201cTee Tot\u201d Payne mentored a young Hank Williams; Gus Cannon taught a young Johnny Cash. Bill Monroe, called \u201cThe Father of Bluegrass,\u201d talked of his indebtedness to the guitarist Arnold Schultz. But all of those black artists would be vastly eclipsed by their mentees.\n\nAnd the one black star of country music\u2019s first era, DeFord Bailey, was likewise treated with an ambivalence that sometimes bled into contempt. The harmonica player, who was the grandson of a slave, became the most frequent performer on the Nashville radio station WSM\u2019s Barn Dance, with his virtuosic renditions of \u201cPan American Blues\u201d and \u201cThe Fox Chase\u201d riling up audiences across the south. In 1927, one of his performances even provided the backdrop for the genesis of the Grand Ole Opry, the radio program that became country music\u2019s central institution, with Bailey one of its pioneer members.\n\nBut Bailey\u2019s race was mostly hidden from his radio audience, and when he did go on tour with the Opry, he was forced to find separate accommodations in a segregated South. \u201cHe was a mascot \u2014 he was very much treated paternalistically,\u201d Huber said. Bailey was fired unceremoniously in 1941. George D. Hay, the founder of the Opry, wrote four years later that \u201cLike some members of his race and other races, DeFord was lazy.\u201d\n\nDeFord spent the rest of his life shining shoes and renting out rooms in his home to make a living. It would take half a century for the Grand Ole Opry to admit another black member (Charley Pride in 1993); besides those two musicians, Darius Rucker is the only other black member in Opry history.\n\nBurns hopes that Lil Nas and other rising black stars like Kane Brown, Blanco Brown and Jimmie Allen will help return the country genre to its diverse roots, and to a time before an early promise of integration was eclipsed by commercial interests. \u201cYou can\u2019t conceive of this music existing without this African-American infusion,\u201d the historian Bill C. Malone says in Country Music. \u201cBut as the music developed professionally, too often African-American musicians were forgotten.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The new PBS documentary series by Ken Burns delves into the black artists that helped shape country music, and then were left behind.", "authors": ["Andrew R.
