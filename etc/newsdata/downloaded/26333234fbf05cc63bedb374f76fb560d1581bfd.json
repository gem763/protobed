They would see me, and even though I was a child, they\u2019d talk about me and my body like I was an adult -- or, you know, shame me for this or shame me for that \u2013 and it was really difficult,\" she continued.\n\nShe said that she struggled with how to respond to this attention.\n\n\"I spent a lot of years trying to figure out who I wanted to be, what I wanted to look like -- if I did this would people stop...if I did this would people stop,\" she explained. \"Over the years I kind of just learned there\u2019s nothing, with not even just body image, that you will be able to do to please everybody.\"\n\n\u201c \u201d They would see me, and even though I was a child, they\u2019d talk about me and my body like I was an adult.\n\nWinter has spoken out many times in past years against internet trolls. In 2017 she posted a pointed response to critics who made rude comments about her outfit in a photo she shared.\n\n\"Please leave young women alone,\" her note read. \"We're just living our lives. It's really troubling that we even have to deal with this kind of stuff nowadays.\"\n\nIn May 2019, she responded to a commenter on her post who speculated about the star having multiple plastic surgery procedures.\n\n\"I wasn't going to reply but I HAVE to ask...what the f--- is cheek bone and chin shaving????\" she replied. \"You're also wrong about all of it by the way. One breast reductions and I lost weight but you do you boo.\"\n\nShe's clearly not afraid to stand up to those trolling her online. But something she\u2019s realized from these critics? Her own opinion is the only one that matters.\n\n\"The only person that you need to take into account is yourself because at the end of the day, it\u2019s just us,\" she said. \"We have everyone around us -- people that we\u2019re super close to -- but at the end of the day, the opinion that matters most, that should be the most valuable one, is your own.\"\n\n\u201c \u201d There\u2019s nothing, with not even just body image, that you will be able to do to please everybody.\n\nShe added that she\u2019s proud of the impact her transparency on social media has had on young women.\n\n\"I get a lot of messages from people, especially girls, telling me that it\u2019s nice that they see somebody talking about, you know, weight in a positive way,\" she said. \"And talking about how you don\u2019t have to fit in one small box, and that\u2019s something that I believe.\"\n\nAlong with using her platform to promote health and an active lifestyle, she also wants to raise awareness on mental health advocacy.\n\n\"For me that\u2019s a big thing,\" she said. \"People get really scared by the term \u2018mental illness\u2019 and I get it -- nobody wants to think that something is an illness -- for me I like to use \u2018mental health\u2019 instead of \u2018mental illness.\u2019\"\n\nThe cause is extremely personal to her. \"I\u2019ve suffered from depression and anxiety in life, and I know so many people that also suffer from that, or suffer from similar things, but never talk about it,\" she explained.\n\n\"They always talk about it in the way of like \u2018my friend feels this way\u2019 or talk about anybody but themselves in that way, and it\u2019s something that\u2019s like -- it\u2019s real, that\u2019s just who we are, that\u2019s what it is,\" she added.\n\n\u201c \u201d It\u2019s okay to get help, it\u2019s okay to go to therapy, it\u2019s okay to take medication, I\u2019ve done it.\n\nShe hopes to eradicate stigmas attached to mental health by using her voice to tell others that it\u2019s OK to not be OK.\n\n\"If you feel that way, you should be able to talk about it without being judged,\" she said. \"You should be able to feel that it\u2019s okay to feel, it\u2019s okay to get help, it\u2019s OK to go to therapy, it\u2019s OK to take medication, I\u2019ve done it.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s OK to have your life fluctuate, it\u2019s OK to have your body fluctuate,\" she continued. \"That\u2019s growing and learning and that\u2019s life.\"\n\n\"We see everything on Instagram and in the papers, and everything looks so amazing. It looks so fantastic -- everyone looks great, everyone\u2019s doing cool things -- but in reality everyone\u2019s life is just life,\" she added.", "description": "As she\u2019s grown older in the industry, the actress has used her platform to speak out on everything from body shaming and cyber bullying to mental health advocacy.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/ariel-winter-01-as-gty-190920_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
