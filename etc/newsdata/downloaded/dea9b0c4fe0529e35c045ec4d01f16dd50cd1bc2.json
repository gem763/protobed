And on Wednesday she was peppered with questions about a possible NFL future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone from just having fun kicking to, \u2018Will she play in the NFL?\u2019 At first I was just laughing about it but the more that I spoke with my husband, he\u2019s all for it and my friends and family, they\u2019re really encouraging me to potentially take up this opportunity,\u201d said Lloyd, who is in Philadelphia with the national team for a victory tour match against Portugal on Thursday night.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

During the World Cup qualifying tournament last fall, she got a 45-yarder at the Cowboys\u2019 practice facility in Texas.\n\nLloyd is well known for her kicking ability. In the World Cup title match in 2015, Lloyd scored three goals including a blast from midfield to give the United States a 5-2 victory over Japan. But she acknowledged that kicking in the NFL is very, very different from scoring from 50-yards out \u2014 like wearing pads and facing 300-pound opponents.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really touch a kicker, but it happens. I\u2019m not naive to that. But there is that part of it, no doubt. And there\u2019s challenges as far as being with all males and the locker room and there\u2019s a whole range of things, and I get that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not afraid to step up in front of the whole world and actually do it.\u201d\n\nIndianapolis Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri, a veteran of five Super Bowls, said earlier this week that he thought Lloyd\u2019s kick was \u201cpretty cool\u201d.\n\nBut like Lloyd, he also said it\u2019s one thing to kick in practice, and another to perform in a game.\n\n\u201cFor you to go out and hit a ball without a rush and a snap and a hold and no get-off time and stuff, it\u2019s different than doing live stuff,\u201d Vinatieri said. \u201cBut I saw it, it was pretty impressive how far she kicked the ball.\u201d\n\nUS coach Jill Ellis, who is stepping down from the team following the victory tour, joked when asked about it: \u201cDid you hear the next one that I\u2019m going to be her agent?\u201d\n\nEllis said if any woman could break into the NFL, it would be Lloyd.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came on the scene, I saw Carli Lloyd strike a ball and I said, \u2018Holy crap that\u2019s the hardest I\u2019ve ever seen a woman hit a ball,\u201d\u2019 Ellis said. \u201cShe certainly has the velocity, and I think it\u2019s very cool. I think it would be great.\u201d\n\nAP", "description": "Fresh off the United States\u2019 victory in the Women\u2019s World Cup, could Carli Lloyd be entertaining thoughts about a career change?
