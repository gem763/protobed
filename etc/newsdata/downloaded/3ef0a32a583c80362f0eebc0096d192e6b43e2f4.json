They can also order technology companies such as Facebook and Google -- both of which opposed the bill during its fast-tracked process through parliament -- to block accounts or sites spreading false information.\n\nThe act also provides for prosecutions of individuals, who can face fines of up to 50,000 SGD (over $36,000), and, or, up to five years in prison. If the alleged falsehood is posted using \"an inauthentic online account or controlled by a bot,\" the total potential fine rises to 100,000 SGD (around $73,000), and, or, up to 10 years in prison.\n\nCompanies found guilty of spreading \"fake news\" can face fines of up to 1 million SGD (around $735,000).", "description": "Singapore's sweeping anti-fake news law, which critics warn could be used to suppress free speech in the already tightly controlled Asian city state, came into force Wednesday.", "authors": ["James Griffiths"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161031214334-01-fake-news-super-tease.jpg"}
