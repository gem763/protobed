Whether it\u2019s Medicare for All or the Green New Deal, her progressive agenda puts ordinary people first, and is overwhelmingly popular as a result\u201d ~~ But, what has she ACTUALLY done for her constituents? What can she point to and say, \u201cPeople in my district are better off because of my accomplishments\u201d? Does running 25,000 jobs out of your district help your people? How about all of the jobs that would have supported those 25,000 people (local restaurants & other businesses), are they better off from your decisions? Hopefully, people in her district wise up and realize that she only cares about HER Brand and getting as much time in the media as she can.", "description": "President Trump was greeted with loud \"boos\" and a special chant when he attended Game 5 of the World Series at Nationals Park. #Colbert #LSSC #ColdOpens", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6XK6Ow6G3Bh.ZOgwwn3mXQ--~B/aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.cbstv.com/438d54aecb615114667ddbe443346614", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
