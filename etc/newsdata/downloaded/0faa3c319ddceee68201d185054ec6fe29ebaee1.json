The Democrats have gone so extreme across every major issue in this election that you really have to see it for yourself to believe it.\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidates have accused President Trump and conservative commentators of exaggerating their positions, but in reality their far-left stances don\u2019t leave much opportunity for exaggeration. Over-the-top, radical, hair-on-fire progressive socialist \u2014 that only begins to describe the field of 2020 Democrats.\n\nThe radicalism of today\u2019s Democrats is not just a political caricature created by the GOP \u2014 the Party\u2019s most influential members really do believe in extremist policies, the likes of which America has never seen before on this scale.\n\nFor instance, they\u2019ve openly acknowledged that they want to \u201cdecriminalize\u201d illegal immigration, provide taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal aliens, increase government spending by countless trillions of dollars, and even take away private health insurance from millions of American workers.\n\nPredictably, the mainstream media have worked overtime to shield the Democrats from scrutiny, even attacking President Trump for pointing out that his opponents have gone off the political deep-end. As an example, last month The New York Times published a lengthy article \u201cfact-checking Trump\u2019s claims that Democrats are radical socialists\u201d \u2014 and naturally, the notoriously left-leaning publication concluded that the president is wrong.\n\nYet, when the Democrats preach clearly socialist solutions to largely non-existent problems \u2014 e.g., their recession obsession \u2014 the media do not challenge, question, scrutinize, or explore deeper the need or the basis for their proposals.\n\nWhen Sanders was asked recently during CNN\u2019s \u201cClimate Crisis Town Hall\u201d if he would be \u201ccourageous enough\u201d to discuss making abortion \u201ca key feature of a plan to address climate catastrophe,\u201d Sanders openly supported increased access to abortion as a means of population control, as well as the notion of funding abortions abroad with U.S. taxpayer dollars, \u201cespecially in poor countries.\u201d\n\nDuring the same event, Sen. Elizabeth Warren vowed to halt all construction of new nuclear power plants, despite the fact that nuclear energy is the cheapest and quickest way to reduce carbon emissions, as well as an outright ban on any new leases for natural gas fracking nationwide.\n\nSenator Kamala Harris, meanwhile, proposed banning plastic straws, despite acknowledging that the paper-based alternatives are woefully inadequate. For his part, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, suggested that fighting climate change might be \u201cperhaps even more challenging\u201d than winning World War II.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar reluctantly admitted that her climate change plan \u2014 which she\u2019s trying to sell as an \u201caffordable\u201d alternative to the Green New Deal \u2014 would still cost U.S. taxpayers between $2 trillion and $3 trillion. \"You got to be honest with people about how you're going to get the money,\" Klobuchar said with a smirk after describing her plan to impose a nationwide \u201ccarbon tax\u201d that would dramatically raise energy prices for millions of consumers.\n\nThis sort of unrestrained radicalism is what today\u2019s Democratic Party sounds like without a media filter. That\u2019s precisely why all American voters should consider it their civic duty to tune in to the debate on Thursday \u2014 the only way to fathom the true extent of the Democrats\u2019 extremism is to hear it for yourself, in their own words.\n\nCharlie Kirk is the founder and executive director of Turning Point USA, an advocacy group for young conservatives.", "description": "I\u2019m recommending something that I never thought I would \u2014 .09/12/2019 19:37:18PM EST.", "authors": ["Charlie Kirk", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/212/69b8b4c5-96e8-4c78-bf49-0d60c9eedf42.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
