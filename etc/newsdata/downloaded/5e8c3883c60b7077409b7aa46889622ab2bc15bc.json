By \u201canti-Trump fraternity\u201d I mean not only the increasingly frantic Democrats who, like Belshazzar at that memorable dinner party many years back, can see the writing ever more clearly on the wall for 2020, but also the NeverTrump sorority who just cannot get over the fact that someone was elected president of the United States without their permission, indeed, over their explicit objections. How dare they!\n\nI ask how stupid they think the American people are because it has long seemed to me that they must have a very low opinion of our intelligence given the preposterous anti-Trump narrative they keep trying to foist off on us.\n\nAt the same time, it must be said that they have a touching trust in our patience. Fans of P.G. Wodehouse may recall that in the preface to Summer Lightning old Plum adduced the \u201cnasty remark\u201d of one critic who complained that a previous novel contained \u201call the old Wodehouse characters under different names.\u201d Ever looking on the bright side, Wodehouse mused that that critic had probably by then been eaten by bears \u201clike the children who made mock of the prophet Elisha.\u201d But if, he noted, said scribe was still among us he would not have been able to make the same objection to Wodehouse\u2019s new novel because this time he put in all the old Wodehouse characters \u201cunder the same names. Pretty silly it will make him feel, I rather fancy.\u201d\n\nSo it is with the anti-Trump/NeverTrump fraternity. Since the wee hours of November 9, 2016, we have repeatedly, over and over, unremittingly been assured that Donald Trump faced a tipping point, that \u201cthe walls were closing in,\u201d that some new revelation was the \u201cbombshell\u201d that at last, finally, would force his resignation and possibly his arrest, incarceration, and (if the winds were just right) his summary execution. Really, take a look if you don\u2019t believe it.\n\nAn Obvious Smear\n\nA moderately intelligent six-year-old could see that the whole \u201cTrump-colluded-with-Russia-to-steal-the-election\u201d wheeze was just silly. It did, however, illustrate the power of inertia. For once that narrative was set in motion, once the bureaucracy got behind it and the resources of the federal government\u2014lubricated by a complicit media\u2014were mobilized, it just kept rolling along, getting bigger and bigger like some monstrous snowball thundering down an infernal snowclad mountain slope. It crashed into nothingness only because of the dogged work of a handful of public spirited sleuths, primus inter pares being Rep. Devin Nunes (R.-Calif.), whose work as head of the House Intelligence Committee first brought some of the scandalous details of the plot to rig an election and destroy a presidency to light.\n\nThe more we learn about that plot, the more difficult it is to believe that anyone ever could have taken it seriously. Remember when \u201cthe dossier\u201d first surfaced? That was supposed to be one of those \u201cbombshells\u201d that was going to precipitate a tipping point and start the walls closing in. But then it turned out that the dossier was just lurid gossip without any foundation. It also turned out that it was opposition gossip (I won\u2019t say \u201cresearch\u201d), commissioned and paid for by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign. But we were still being asked to take it seriously, just as we were asked to take Peter Strzok and Lisa Page seriously as impartial investigators even though they entertained themselves by larding their love-texts to each other with wild anti-Trump imprecations and fantasies about an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d that either would prevent his election or assure his removal in case the worst happened.\n\nThe thing to remember is that we were never meant to hear about Strzok or Page. Neither were we meant to know about the FISA warrants against Carter Page and others. The whole machinery of the government\u2019s attempted coup was supposed to have proceeded invisibly and, like those tapes left for Jim Phelps at the beginning of episodes of \u201cMission Impossible,\u201d self-destructed without leaving a trace. It would have, too, had only the inevitable happened and Hillary Clinton won the election.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t, and bit by bit the curtain has been drawn back from the Greatest Show on Earth. It\u2019s a dance of 7, or maybe 700, veils however, notwithstanding the fact that one is much like the next. For a couple of years it was collusion with Russia and the investigation by Robert Mueller, who started off like a Canadian Mountie (they always get their man) and ended up like Chauncey Gardiner in \u201cBeing There.\u201d\n\nA Sad Re-Run\n\nThey played essentially the same drama with Brett Kavanaugh\u2014totally fabricated allegations, vicious, round-the-clock hysteria in an effort to destroy a target, and sudden and total deflation when the ploy was exposed. But note that exposure and refutation are never final. Just a few weeks ago, the wretched New York Times wheeled out essentially the same accusation against Kavanaugh, betting, or at least hoping, that no one would notice.\n\nAnd so it goes on. The fabricated, make-believe scandal of Donald Trump\u2019s telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky began unravelling before the ink was dry on the newspapers reporting it. But that didn\u2019t stop the New York Times, reprising their gambit with Brett Kavanaugh, from shouting that a second anonymous \u201cwhistleblower\u201d had been found who was just about to come forward and spew more malign anti-Trump gossip into the cloaca maxima of the effort to rid the world of Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe official,\u201d intoned our fishwrap of record, \u201chas more direct information about the events than the first whistle-blower, whose complaint that Mr. Trump was using his power to get Ukraine to investigate his political rivals touched off an impeachment inquiry.\u201d And just in case the anti-Trump bias of that was not sufficiently patent, the Times helpfully provided this caption to a photo of the President: \u201cPresident Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. during a phone call.\u201d\n\nOh really? In addition to assuming our stupidity and presuming on our patience, the Times apparently believes that we cannot read. That call in July between Donald Trump and the Ukrainian President was about efforts to influence the 2016 election, not the 2020 election. How do we know? President Trump said so in his call. Let me quote from the transcript. \u201cI would like you to do us a favor,\u201d the President said. Smoking gun? No.\n\nI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike\u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people\u2026 The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you\u2019re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.\n\nThe favor is not to investigate Joe Biden and his corrupt coke-head son, but to look into the activities of the private, Ukraine-based cyber security firm CrowdStrike. Who they? Julie Kelly explained:\n\nCrowdStrike is a cybersecurity firm with strong ties to the Democratic Party. After the DNC server was hacked in early 2016, Perkins Coie, a politically connected law firm, hired CrowdStrike on behalf of the DNC to find out who was behind the intrusion. (Perkins Coie is the same law firm that hired Fusion GPS on behalf of the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign to dig up Russia-related dirt on Team Trump before the election.) That isn\u2019t the extent of CrowdStrike\u2019s dubious political ties. Its co-founder, Moscow-born Dmitri Alperovitch, is associated with the Clinton Foundation; in 2015, CrowdStrike received $100 million in funding from Google whose chairman, Eric Schmidt, was a generous supporter of Hillary Clinton. CrowdStrike\u2019s president is Shawn Henry, who headed up the FBI\u2019s cybercrimes division during the Obama Administration when Robert Mueller was director.\n\nRemember the meme that it was the Russians who hacked the DNC server? CrowdStrike is the sole, the only source of that contention. The FBI apparently asked to examine the server but the DNC refused, turning it over to their own their own people who told them and the world exactly what they wanted to hear.\n\nSo, Donald Trump asked President Zelensky to help with the Justice Department\u2019s investigation of efforts to subvert the 2016 election. Donald Trump is the president of the United States. It is part of his responsibility to see that our elections are open and fair. Bottom line: not much to work with there for the anti-Trump fraternity.\n\nBut didn\u2019t he foist his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on the Ukrainians? No, he didn\u2019t. President Zlenesky brought up Rudy. \u201cI will personally tell you,\u201d Zelensky said, \u201cthat one of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nTrump responded that he held Giuliani in high regard and then went on to note that \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. . . It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nIt sounds horrible to me, too. As all the world now knows (though Joe Biden himself hasn\u2019t got round to admitting it yet), in 2013 Hunter Biden travelled to Beijing on Air Force 2 with his father, then vice president. Dear old dad was gracious and accommodating to the Chinese. The Chinese in turn were accommodating to Joe Biden. How? Ten days after Biden p\u00e8re et fils returned to the States, Hunter\u2019s small private equity firm got a $1.5 billion private equity deal with the Chinese government.\n\nThis deal, as the investigative reporter Peter Schweizer wrote, was not with some Chinese corporation, but \u201cwith the government. And what people need to realize,\u201d Schweizer continued, is that \u201c Hunter Biden has no background in China. He has no background in private equity. The deal he got in the Shanghai free-trade zone, nobody else had\u2014Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Blackstone, nobody had this deal.\u201d\n\nThen there was Hunter in Ukraine. In 2014, while Joe Biden\u2014still the vice president\u2014was overseeing America\u2019s Ukraine policy, Hunter became involved with a corrupt Ukraine natural gas company called Burisma. In April of that year, Hunter Biden agreed to join Burisma\u2019s board of directors, ostensibly to advise on legal issues. Here\u2019s Peter Schweizer again: \u201cBiden had no known expertise on the natural gas industry, but Burisma was certainly in need of help.\u201d\n\nEarlier that month, British officials had frozen the London bank accounts of Burisma\u2019s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, and soon after, Ukrainian officials opened their own corruption investigation into Burisma, the Kyiv Post in Ukraine reported. Hunter Biden helped to recruit a legal team for Burisma, including former Obama administration Justice Department official John Buretta and several American consulting firms, the New York Times reported. The younger Biden was well compensated for his efforts. Records obtained by the Government Accountability Institute show he was paid as much as $83,333 per month for his work at Burisma.\n\nYou see what Trump meant by \u201chorrible.\u201d\n\nImpeachment Scam\n\nI have no idea whose bright idea it was to float the Ukrainian scam. Possibly Pinocchio Schiff, since he has been smack dab in the middle of the drama. The ostensible purpose, of course, is to destroy Donald Trump (isn\u2019t everything?). But as I have said previously, one of the certain results will be the destruction of Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy and possibly his son\u2019s career.\n\nOf course, we can\u2019t turn on the television or look at a news report without hearing the word \u201cimpeachment.\u201d Multiple House committees have fallen over one another to shout that they are opening a \u201cformal impeachment inquiry.\u201d But as Andy McCarthy just pointed out, there is no formal impeachment inquiry. \u201cWhat is portrayed as an \u2018impeachment inquiry\u2019 is actually just a made-for-cable-TV political soap opera. The House of Representatives is not conducting a formal impeachment inquiry. To the contrary, congressional Democrats are conducting the 2020 political campaign.\u201d\n\nThat is exactly right. The dispiriting thing is that even now, even at this late date, they cannot acknowledge the obvious: Donald Trump won the 2016 election fair and square. He looks likely to win the 2020 election, too, something the Democrats also know but cannot countenance. Hence their round-the-clock effort to repeal the 2016 election, besmirch the president, and achieve \u201cby any means necessary\u201d the destruction of their political rival.\n\nIt used to be that politics involved compromise and accommodation. The Democrats have radicalized the process, declaring illegitimate anyone who is not themselves. It is profoundly anti-American as well as profoundly anti-democratic. We should all hope that they fail again in their effort to effect an anti-Trump coup, not because it is about Trump but because it is about the survival of our republic and \u201cwe the people\u201d who are supposed to be sovereign.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amgreatness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1173565688.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
