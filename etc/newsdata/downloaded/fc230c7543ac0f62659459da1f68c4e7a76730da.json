This is first class all the way. (Tim Carter)\n\nQ: I want to build a deluxe shed. I\u2019ve just retired and have plenty of time on my hands. I want to stop paying the outrageous offsite storage fees.\n\nFirst and foremost, what do you think of my shed matching my house? Is this a good idea or a waste of time? In your opinion, what are the best things to include in a shed? What are the biggest mistakes homeowners make when they build sheds? \u2014 Daniel P., Lincoln, Neb.\n\nA: You are not the only person who has accumulated so much stuff that you pay to store it at some offsite facility. If you add up what you pay in a year, you can buy quite a bit of material to build a handsome shed in just a few weeks. Ask most real estate agents, and they\u2019ll probably say a nice shed adds value to a home.\n\nMost people consider matching the color of the shed to the color of the house, but that\u2019s where it stops. Only a few take it to the next step and consider building a facsimile of the actual house! Yes, you can create a miniature version of your house in almost all cases. It\u2019s not as hard as you might think \u2014 and, believe me, you\u2019ll get a lot of compliments!\n\n[More Builder: How to dress up your vinyl siding]\n\nThe process of making the shed match the house is simple. The first step is to create a simple plan of the minimum size your shed should be. One of the biggest mistakes homeowners make is building a shed far too small for their needs. I recorded a video a few years ago showing how simple it is to create a perfect shed for your stuff. You can view this \u201cPlanning a Shed\u201d video on my AsktheBuilder.com website.\n\nOnce you have the outer dimensions of your new shed, you need to see how they compare to the shape of your home. If your home is rectangular, then try to mold your shed dimensions to mimic this shape and maintain a reasonable ratio if possible. It doesn't have to be perfect, but you'll achieve the best possible look if you maintain both the shape and size ratio.\n\nMy sheds have always had electric power in them. It\u2019s so nice to have lights and to be able to plug in tools. A simple 30-amp 240-volt circuit is usually plenty of power for just about anything you would do inside a shed.\n\nI discovered about 20 years ago that overhead doors offer the most utility getting things in and out of sheds. A six-foot-wide door allows plenty of room to get a decent-size lawn tractor in and out of the shed.\n\nIf your home is two-story, you get an added benefit. You\u2019ll discover when you do the height ratio that the shed ceiling height will almost always be about nine or 10 feet tall. This allows you to include a small loft along one or two walls for extra storage of larger boxes.\n\nMany sheds have wood floor systems. You'll want to use treated lumber for your floor joists, and I'd highly recommend using treated plywood for the flooring. Treated plywood is readily available from most neighborhood lumberyards, and you never have to worry about the floor getting wet.\n\nThe last shed I built not only had treated floor joists and treated plywood, but it also had four inches of closed-cell foam insulation in between the joists. This foam was flush with the top of the joists, allowing me to finish the shed at a later date and have a toasty warm floor in winter months.\n\n[More Builder: Why you probably shouldn\u2019t flush \u2018flushable\u2019 wipes]\n\nThe biggest blunders made by homeowners shouldn\u2019t surprise you. Don\u2019t forget natural light. You can incorporate simple low-profile skylights or roof windows to let in copious amounts of natural light.\n\nI\u2019ve received countless emails from homeowners who failed to install a normal three-foot-wide normal door in one wall of their shed. They want to know how to add one later. Large swinging shed doors are a pain and can be dangerous on windy days. A normal man-door in addition to a larger opening is a must. Avoid that mistake.\n\nDon't skimp on the foundation. All too many sheds I've seen are just setting on concrete blocks on the soil. Do this and your shed may start to roll around the neighborhood in the next windstorm. Your shed may get twisted out of shape without a great foundation system should you live where the ground freezes. Frost heave can lift the shed unequally and contort it so much you can't open a door or window.\n\nDon\u2019t build the shed too close to the ground. It\u2019s best to have at least a six-inch air space under wood floor joists for air circulation. You can install decorative screening to keep critters from living under the shed. Install a great vapor barrier under a concrete slab that is the floor of your shed. Too many homeowners forget this important step.\n\nSubscribe to Tim\u2019s free newsletter and listen to his new podcasts.
