Adding that this model seeks to have a single integrated plan per district, which integrates various roles for government, communities and civil society working together to ensure the resuscitation of communities.\n\nMagashule said the national executive committee had resolved that entrenching a user-pay mentality among communities was essential in addressing the various problems crippling most municipalities.\n\nRead: Warning shots as ANC tries to save municipalities\n\nHe said when municipalities run into problems, the government should start by using Section 154 of the Constitution, which encourages citizens to pay for what they use, to address problems and support municipalities instead of subsidising these communities.\n\nMagashule \u2013 who was accompanied by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, ANC head of economic transformation Enoch Godongwana, Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, and Minister of Small Business Development Khumbudzo Ntshavheni \u2013 said municipalities should settle old debts that they owe in particular to Eskom and water boards.\n\nHis counterpart, Godongwana, said a culture of paying debts should be cultivated starting from government, municipalities and communities all paying what they owe.\n\nWithout mentioning names, Godongwana said that there was a particular municipality owing billions to Eskom.\n\n\u201cMunicipalities owing Eskom and water boards must settle outstanding debts or make arrangements to do so and Eskom and water boards must refund municipalities where it has overcharged them. National and provincial departments that owe municipalities and Eskom for services must also pay their debts,\u201d said Magashule.\n\nMagashule said that relevant authorities in government would ensure that the funds that were paid back would be managed responsibly.\n\n\u201cThe relevant authorities in government will ensure that money owing are settled in a manageable way over the coming period,\u201d Magashule said.\n\nDlamini-Zuma said that the three spheres of government working together would ensure that there is response to the needs of communities.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll spheres of government will work together to ensure that small businesses improve, we want to ensure that things we see as a potential starts being a reality,\u201d Dlamini-Zuma said.\n\nDlamini-Zuma reiterated that in order to have better economic growth, citizens should adopt the culture to pay what they owe.\n\nMunicipalities owing Eskom and water boards must settle outstanding debts or make arrangements to do so and Eskom and water boards must refund municipalities where it has overcharged them\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a culture of paying when we are supposed to pay, which is why we are asking national government to pay for all they owe. We are also say that Eskom must pay municipalities.\u201d\n\nLast month, President Cyril Ramaphosa endorsed the model, and launched a pilot version of the programme in the OR Tambo District municipality, which will be followed by 44 other districts and eight metros in the near future.", "description": "In a bid to crack the whip on underperforming municipalities and improving service delivery, the ANC\u2019s highest decision-making body, the national executive committee, has endorsed the implementation of a district development model.", "authors": ["Mandisa Nyathi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8812/ba3d519d3eeb43e9aafca2b5b3082808.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
