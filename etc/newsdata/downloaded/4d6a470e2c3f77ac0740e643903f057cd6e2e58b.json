He is focusing on companies such as Boeing Co (N: ) and General Electric Co (N: ) that have strong balance sheets yet are struggling due to issues including a corporate turnaround and the grounding of the 737 MAX airliner.\n\n\"Even if they were to be downgraded, they would be able to tender that debt to create better liquidity,\" keeping their strong balance sheets intact, he said.\n\nTom Atteberry, portfolio manager of the $7.3 billion FPA New Income fund, said negative bond yields in Europe and Japan are prompting more foreign investors to pick up U.S. debt, which will continue to push yields lower throughout the market.\n\nHe is finding opportunities in bonds backed by prime-rated auto leases, loans for equipment ranging from cell phones to service fleets, and 15-year mortgage pools that originated in 2012 and 2013, he said. Each category offers yields between 1.90% and 2.25%, compared with the 1.73% yield the benchmark 10-year Treasury offered Thursday, and should continue to do well if interest rates fall.\n\n\"You should have higher yields, but you've got two large economic blocs with negative yields and central bank interventions on an ongoing basis,\" he said. \"It's almost an unnatural time.\"", "description": "Wall Street Weekahead: Bond fund managers see risk Fed cuts rates to zero", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9O0S9_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
