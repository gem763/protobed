Officers fired tear gas in the busy shopping neighborhood of Causeway Bay where protesters had massed after some started a fire at an entrance to the city\u2019s busiest subway station.\n\nEarlier, tens of thousands marched peacefully to the U.S. consulate, after filling up a park the size of a football field and stretching for blocks in every direction. Separately on Sunday, prominent activist Joshua Wong said he was arrested at the airport for allegedly breaching bail conditions.\n\nOn Saturday, at least 19 people were injured, two seriously, in clashes between police and protesters outside the Mong Kok police station and elsewhere. Chief Executive Carrie Lam last week scrapped the extradition bill that sparked the ongoing wave of demonstrations, which deteriorated last weekend into some of the worst violence in the former British colony since its return to Chinese rule in 1997. The withdrawal of the bill was one of five demands made by protesters.\n\nHere\u2019s the latest (all times local):\n\nTear gas fired (7 p.m.)\n\nPolice fired tear gas to disperse crowds in Causeway Bay, while MTR Corp., operator of the city\u2019s rail network, announced that the Wan Chai station was closed temporarily.\n\nBlazing barricade (6 p.m.)\n\nProtesters set a barricade ablaze at a shuttered entrance to Central station and started another fire on a busy road. Demonstrators also smashed windows and trashed stairwells at other train-station access points in the area. Riot police started clearing streets in the prime business district as firefighters arrived and cleaned up the burning debris.\n\nWong arrested (5 p.m.)\n\nHong Kong activist Joshua Wong said he was arrested on Sunday at the city\u2019s airport for breaching bail conditions. Wong said in a statement through his legal representative that he was being held in custody and expected to be released after a hearing on Monday.\n\nCentral station closed (4 p.m.)\n\nMTR closed the Central station temporarily because of \u201can escalation of the situation\u201d and to ensure the safety of passengers and staff, the company said on its website, without elaborating. There was a heavy riot police presence in the station and officers ordered people to leave. One handcuffed man lay on the ground, surrounded by police.\n\nMarch to consulate (1.pm.)\n\nThousands of protesters walked the two blocks from Chater Gardens in Central to the U.S. Consulate in an authorized march calling for a \u201cHong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act,\u201d proposed by a bipartisan group of American lawmakers. Some of the protesters carried U.S. flags in the peaceful procession, which was guided and monitored by police officers.\n\nOne of the marchers, who would only give his name as Harvey, said: \u201cWe are asking America to pass the Act, so we are carrying American flags. We want to tell U.S. congress that whatever Carrie Lam is doing, it is not satisfying. If the U.S. can sanction China, it might save us.\u201d\n\nBernard Chan, the convener of the city\u2019s Executive Council, said in an interview on Friday that some acts by protesters can be seen as violating the \u201cthree bottom lines\u201d that China has outlined. These are: any acts that harm China\u2019s security of national sovereignty, challenge the power of the central government and the Basic Law, or take advantage of Hong Kong to infiltrate and damage the mainland.\n\n\u201cProtesting is not the issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue is those violent acts ... Now you are asking the U.S. to intervene in Hong Kong. Come on. If you really want to help Hong Kong, stop doing all that. You just give China reason\u201d to intervene. \u201cThat\u2019s not good dialogue.\u201d\n\n19 injured in clashes (12.30 p.m.)\n\nA total 19 people were admitted to hospital after clashes between police and protesters on Saturday night, according to a spokesman for the Hospital Authority who declined to be identified. Two men were in serious condition, he said by phone.\n\n\u2018Media targeted\u2019 (Sunday 1 a.m.)\n\nThe Hong Kong Journalists Association condemned what it said was police\u2019s use of pepper spray on reporters and photographers at close range on Saturday. At least two journalists were sprayed directly in the face, it said. The area in Mong Kok where the incident took place had earlier been cleared of protesters, according to the statement.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong police fired tear gas at protesters who built barricades, started blazes and paralyzed traffic in the city\u2019s prime business area on Sunday as unrest becomes increasingly difficult to contain.Riot police dispersed demonstrators in parts of Central only for them to regather in", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YfXXvwhg1OPVwDSqLxlErQ--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/10ce833dfbb13280a8819251ef4d96af", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
