The company announced Thursday that it raised $27.6 million in a Series A round led by Ibex Investors. The equity round included newcomer Toyota AI Ventures and further investments from Blue Collective, Launch Capital and Maniv Mobility.\n\nRevel plans to use the funds to expand its fleet of scooters within the cities it currently operates as well as into new markets. Reig wouldn\u2019t name where Revel will launch next. However, he provided a few hints.\n\nRevel is targeting about 10 cities by mid-2020, Reig said in an interview earlier this week. He added that likely candidates would be major U.S. cities with temperate weather conditions. That puts cities in Florida, Texas, Arizona and California as likely destinations.\n\nThinknum, which tracks companies and creates data sets that measure hiring, revenue and other factors, charted out job listings at Revel. What the company found was nearly a dozen jobs posted since July that will be based in Texas.\n\nWhile Revel\u2019s job listings point to Texas, the company isn\u2019t ready to talk.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t confirm specific launch timelines right now, but Revel is having productive conversations with markets in Texas among other places,\u201d a company spokesperson said in response to TechCrunch\u2019s inquiry. \u201cWe look forward to bringing our service to new cities in the coming months.\u201d\n\nRevel is different from other shared mobility-as-a-service providers, especially scooter companies, because it doesn\u2019t use gig economy or contract workers. It only employs full-time workers. This would suggest that Revel isn\u2019t merely experimenting with Texas; it has intentions to build out operations there.\n\nThe job listings include openings for a manager, mechanic and customer service support. Some of these jobs actually list Texas City, Texas as the destination. It\u2019s not clear if this is actually where Revel will deploy. Texas City is about 42 miles southeast of Houston.", "description": "Revel, the New York-based shared electric moped startup, appears to be preparing to expand into Texas, according to job listings first spotted and reported by Thinknum Alternative Data.
