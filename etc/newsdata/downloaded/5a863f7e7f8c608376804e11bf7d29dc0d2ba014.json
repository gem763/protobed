It flourished from the 17th century through to the 19th century during the Edo period.\n\nEuronews sat down with the director of the Adachi Foundation, Meguri Nakayama to find out more.\n\n\u201cUkiyo-e was part of popular culture and enjoyed by the general public during the Edo period. The prints were produced by publishing houses and they depict the fashionable beautiful women of the time as well as nature.\u201d\n\nJapan -then and now\n\nBut how is Tokyo\u2019s art scene navigating its past and present, and where does it fit into the high-speed algorithmic age we live in?\n\n\u201cI think that today in a digital era, the fact that what we do is analogue - and each painting is done one-by-one, by hand, that\u2019s what\u2019s attractive\u201d\n\nMany of the scenes illustrated in Ukio-ye can still be found in the city today. Euronews reporter Naomi Lloyd visited the Shin-ohashi bridge, as depicted in the great Ukiyo-e master Utagawa Hiroshige's famous painting.\n\n\u201cIn Utagawa Hiroshige\u2019s famous painting \u2013 people crossing Shin-ohashi bridge are caught in a sudden shower. This is exactly where they would have walked along - although the bridge is no longer wooden - and we're definitely luckier with the weather today.\u201d\n\nWake Me Up (before you Goph Goph)\n\nVan Gogh was so enamoured with the work of Utagawa Hiroshige, he reproduced his own copy in oil paint.\n\nAt the Adachi institute, as well as replicating older, well-known works, the institute collaborates with contemporary artists to create new original pieces.\n\nUkiyo-e: still inspiring newer generations\n\nArtisans are trained in the same age-old techniques, keeping the tradition alive for future generations.\n\nEuronews spoke to artisan Chikura Kishi about how he is inspired by the old art form of Ukiyo-e.\n\n\u201cI was a student at the university of fine arts and by chance I had the opportunity to see the technique of Ukiyo-e. I was fascinated by the high level techniques that had taken generations to achieve and so that was how I got started.\u201d\n\nKishi is one of a new generation of Tokyo artists who uses Ukiyo-e techniques to create a new style of art but other artists like Akira Yamaguchi look a bit closer to home for inspiration. He spent most of his life living in the Chuo neighbourhood.\n\n\u201cYou can see that this neighbourhood is different from other areas. The mix of modernity and the old buildings interwoven together here - that\u2019s what inspires the styles in my paintings.\u201d\n\nIn his cityscapes - old-fashioned Japanese buildings and characters coexist alongside high-rise modern skyscrapers, with elements of fantasy and science fiction woven in. But it doesn't stop there as Yamaguchi is already an accomplished Manga artist in his own right.\n\nTokyo artists are at the forefront of the manga scene and the locations featured in their drawings attract visitors from around the world. Manga expert Nana Midoro sees a both Manga and Ukiyo-e as integral Japanese culture.\n\n\u201cManga is a big part of Japanese culture and art. There are similarities between Manga and Ukiyo-e - Manga artists use the same perspective as in a work of Ukiyo-e to draw the best angles possible to show the action in each frame\u201d\n\nTokyo is a city which definitely offer mounds of inspiration for a new generation of artist. But how it will continue to evolve remains to be seen.", "description": "Euronews reporter Naomi Lloyd discovers that Tokyo is a city of contrasts - where rich traditions sit alongside futuristic innovation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/18/68/64/1000x563_cmsv2_82f0c957-c370-5284-ae7f-1684b215b4d4-4186864.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
