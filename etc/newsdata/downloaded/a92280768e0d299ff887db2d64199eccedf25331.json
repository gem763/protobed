He said in the complaint that it is his \u201csincerely held religious belief that I attend Friday congregational prayer.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I am observing my faith at work, my job is at risk,\u201d he said in the complaint.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe part-time employee was hired at the DMV in January and asked for an accommodation allowing him to attend Friday prayers for an hour by taking his lunch and office breaks at the same time. He received approval for that adjustment in February, allowing him to leave work for prayer, but it expired after three months, according to the complaint.\n\nThe man sent two requests in May asking for an extension of his accommodation and for the time to be pushed back an hour because Muslims use a lunar calendar for prayers. Meaning, the prayer times are altered throughout the year, according to the complaint.\n\nThe DMV rejected both requests, saying it could not accommodate \u201cyour request to leave during the day Friday\u2019s for your religious observance.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn essential function of your position is to work certain hours,\u201d the complaint said the DMV representative told the employee. \u201cAltering your schedule poses an undue hardship on the operational needs of the office.\u201d\n\nThe employee also submitted a request to adjust his schedule for Ramadan from 11:30 p.m. to 3:15 p.m., which was also denied because of the same reasoning, the complaint stated.\n\n\u201cSince May 4, 2019, I have been forced to choose between my religion and my ability to earn a living,\u201d he said in the complaint.\n\nCAIR-NY Litigation Director Ahmed Mohamed said in a statement that the department\u2019s denial of the employee\u2019s accommodation request \u201cis inexcusable and a clear violation of the New York State Human Rights Law.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen our client was hired, he was provided the accommodation for three months, and he was able to do his job without any hardship to the DMV,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cWithout explanation, the DMV arbitrarily decided that our client was no longer permitted to have a reasonable accommodation to observe his religious practices.\u201d\n\nA DMV official told the Religious News Service it would not comment on personnel matters and accommodations are decided case-by-case to avoid \u201cundue hardships\u201d in the office.\n\nThe Hill reached out to the New York DMV and CAIR-NY for comment.\n\nCAIR filed a complaint last week to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of a Muslim woman who was banned from wearing her hijab at work because her supervisor said it made her look \u201clike a terrorist.\u201d", "description": "The New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-NY) announced Monday that an employee filed a discrimination complaint against the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for not ac", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/muslim_congregation.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
