That is equivalent to five cases for every day of the English school year.\n\nIt comes amid a surge in knife crime with offences rising to 43,516 in the year ending March 2019, an 80 per cent increase from the low point in 2014 when there were 23,945 offences. This is the highest since comparable data began being compiled in 2011.\n\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"The scourge of weapons has grown worse in recent years, and while there are a number of complex factors involved, a key issue has been cuts in policing and local support services for vulnerable families.\n\n\"Gangs have filled this vacuum and often pressure and groom young people into dealing drugs and carrying weapons. Schools are doing their best to tackle these problems, but they cannot possibly solve this issue on their own.\u201d", "description": "Children are being caught with knives in schools up to five times a day, figures reveal.", "authors": ["Charles Hymas", "Home Affairs Editor", "Con Coughlin"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/16/TELEMMGLPICT000194414407-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
