Kamala Harris ripped President Trump on NBC\u2019s \u201cLate Night\u201d Monday, saying his press conference announcing the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi sounded like \u201ccommentary on a video game\u201d and lacked the seriousness needed from a commander in chief.\n\nMr. Trump took a victory lap Sunday in announcing that that al-Baghdadi was killed during a U.S. military operation in northwest Syria, bringing \u201cthe world\u2019s number one terrorist leader to justice.\u201d The president said the terrorist leader was cornered by U.S. forces in a \u201cdead-end tunnel,\u201d where he detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and three of what were believed to be his children.\n\n\u201cA brutal killer, one who has caused so much hardship and death, has violently been eliminated,\u201d the president said during the conference. \u201cHe will never again harm another innocent man, woman, or child. He died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with \u201cLate Night\u201d host Seth Meyers, Ms. Harris called the press conference \u201cextraordinary.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would\u2019ve [thought] that he was talking about watching and giving commentary on a video game,\u201d Ms. Harris said.\n\n\u201cHe is the commander in chief. The commander in chief of the United States of America has as her highest priority the responsibility to concern herself with our nation\u2019s security and the security of our homeland,\u201d she said, sparking a wave of applause for her use of \u201cher.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery step becomes clear that he clearly does not fully appreciate the importance of the job, which must be done with integrity, must be done in a way that is solemn, understanding what is at stake,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd \u2014 but I give full credit to our military, to our Special Forces, to our intelligence committee for the work they\u2019ve done and continue to do.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the interview, Ms. Harris praised the U.S. military and intelligence community for \u201ctirelessly and selflessly\u201d doing \u201cincredible work\u201d while receiving little recognition as individuals.\n\n\u201cThese are people who serve our country and die for our country who never get personal acknowledgement,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that it\u2019s really important at this moment to also credit them knowing that you\u2019ve had Donald Trump as commander in chief, who has spent full time attacking the integrity and the professionalism and the sacrifice of those professionals.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
