Photograph: ZUMA Press/Alamy\n\nShot on a Leica 35mm camera, the black-and-white images are considered Frank\u2019s masterwork and focused on figures from the overlooked margins of American life \u2013 from teenage couples and factory workers to bikers. Dubbed the \u201cManet of the new photography\u201d by the New Yorker critic Janet Malcolm, Frank was considered the father of \u201cthe snapshot aesthetic\u201d, which captures a spontaneous moment taken on the fly.\n\nCulled from a collection of around 28,000 pictures, The Americans would influence artists including Jeff Wall, Mary Ellen Mark and Ed Ruscha, who said seeing the book as a young man was \u201ca stunning, ground-trembling experience\u201d that inspired him to make his own art. \u201cI was tired of romanticism,\u201d Frank said of The Americans, \u201cI wanted to present what I saw, pure and simple.\u201d\n\nThat pursuit of purity and simplicity helped Frank find what Sean O\u2019Hagan described as \u201cthe chasm between the American dream and the everyday reality\u201d, with Kerouac saying in his introduction to the US edition of the book, which was released in 1959, that Frank had \u201csucked a sad poem out of America\u201d with the 83 images.\n\nSarah Greenough, senior curator of photography at the National Gallery of Art in Washington \u2013 who compiled a major exhibition dedicated to Frank in 2008 \u2013 said the photographs revealed a people \u201cwho were plagued by racism\u201d, \u201cill-served by their politicians\u201d, and also rendered \u201cincreasingly numb by the rising culture of consumerism\u201d. \u201cBut it\u2019s also important to point out that he found new areas of beauty in those simple, overlooked corners of American life,\u201d she added. \u201cIn diners, or on the street. He pioneered a whole new subject matter that we [now] define as icons: cars, jukeboxes, even the road itself.\u201d\n\nAs well as Frank\u2019s style challenging the rules of photography which had been solidified by the likes of Henri Cartier-Bresson, Frank was also set on challenging the American establishment. \u201cMy mother asked me, \u2018Why do you always take pictures of poor people?\u2019 Frank told the New York Times. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t true, but my sympathies were with people who struggled. There was also my mistrust of people who made the rules.\u201d\n\nFrank\u2019s style was widely credited as opening the door for other photographers such as Diane Arbus, whose work was exhibited at the hugely influential New Documents exhibition at MoMA in 1969 alongside at-the-time up-and-coming artists Lee Friedlander and Garry Winogrand.\n\nIn the 60s and 70s Frank would become a countercultural figure and establish himself as an avant-garde filmmaker. New York Times film critic Manohla Dargis called Frank \u201cone of the most important and influential American independent filmmakers of the last half-century\u201d and his short-form films featured Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and Alice Neel.\n\nAfter being commissioned to take cover photography for Exile on Main Street, Frank went on to make Cocksucker Blues, a documentary about the Rolling Stones\u2019 1972 tour of America, which the band sued him for in order to prevent its release. Described as \u201can ambient Stones movie\u201d it showed the band and groupies involved in drug taking and group sex. It was shelved in favour of another documentary of the 1972 tour, titled Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones.\n\nIn the same year Frank released Lines of My Hand, a book which signalled the artist\u2019s move to more autobiographical work that could also be seen in the 1988 film, Candy Mountain, a road movie directed with Rudy Wurlitzer.\n\nLou Reed, another musician, wrote about how much he admired Frank\u2019s work in The Lines of My Hand, in 2004. \u201cTo wish for the crazy times one last time and freeze it in the memory of a camera is the least a great artist can do,\u201d he wrote. \u201cRobert Frank is a great democrat. We\u2019re all in these photos. Paint dripping from a mirror like blood.\u201d\n\nThere was tragedy in Frank\u2019s personal life: first his daughter Andrea, was killed, aged 20, in a plane crash in Guatemala in 1974, and 20 years later his son Pablo took his own life in 1994 after suffering with schizophrenia. The artist June Leaf, his wife, survives him.\n\n\u201cThe kind of photography I did is gone. It\u2019s old,\u201d Frank told the Guardian in 2004. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in it any more for me, and I get no satisfaction from trying to do it. There are too many pictures now. It\u2019s overwhelming.\u201d", "description": "Frank\u2019s seminal book The Americans, with an introduction by Jack Kerouac, helped to change the direction of photography", "authors": ["Lanre Bakare"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/625f3068028ba566e09dcef35e4d5aa6a0cdc71f/0_44_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=12baf5e5bbba5a2ee3baeeefe7749aa4", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
