It only means it will be an exceedingly difficult task.\n\nAD\n\nNationals come back to shock Brewers in wild-card game\n\nThe Dodgers both scored the most runs and allowed the fewest in the NL this season, producing a run differential \u2014 plus-273 \u2014 that is the third-best of any team this century, behind only the 2001 Seattle Mariners (plus-300) and the 2019 Houston Astros (plus-280).\n\nAD\n\nTheir pitchers posted the lowest ERA (3.37) and WHIP (1.102) in the NL, and their hitters the highest OPS (.810) and most home runs (an NL-record 279). Advanced stats love them no less: Per FanGraphs, both their pitchers and their hitters amassed the most WAR (wins above replacement) in the league.\n\nWhat about defense? By defensive runs saved, as calculated by Baseball Info Solutions, the Dodgers\u2019 figure (135) was the best in the game. (The Nationals, by comparison, were 18th, at minus-2.) They were also tied for first in Baseball Prospectus\u2019s defensive efficiency \u2014 the rate at which balls in play are converted into outs \u2014 at .729. (The Nationals were 15th, at .704.)\n\nAD\n\nThe Dodgers\u2019 defensive numbers were undoubtedly helped by the fact they were the most prolific shifters in the game, employing a shift on 52.5 percent of all pitches, per Statcast. (The Nationals, by contrast, shifted on just 14.6 percent of pitches, ranking 28th in the majors.) Unlike most teams, which shift infrequently against right-handed hitters \u2014 the league average this year was 14.3 percent of overall pitches \u2014 the Dodgers did so at nearly three times that rate (42.3 percent).\n\nAD\n\nIn center fielder Cody Bellinger \u2014 who could also see time at first base, given the Dodgers\u2019 propensity for platoons and multi-positional defenders \u2014 they have the potential NL most valuable player and a hitter who, unlike in years past, can no longer be neutralized (or banished to the bench) by lefties, against whom he hit .280/.386/.596 this season.\n\nOne remarkable aspect of the Dodgers\u2019 lineup is its seeming invincibility against high velocities. As a team, they slugged a major-league-leading .542 against pitches of 95 mph and up in 2019, higher than their overall slugging percentage (.472) and 123 points above the league norm (.419). (The Nationals, meanwhile, ranked sixth in the majors at .462.) What does that mean? Don\u2019t expect right-hander Tanner Rainey, the Nationals\u2019 hardest-throwing reliever, to come in and shut down the Dodgers for large stretches at will.\n\nAD\n\nEven the Dodgers\u2019 perceived weakness \u2014 their bullpen \u2014 wasn\u2019t as bad as advertised: Their relievers\u2019 collective ERA of 3.85 ranked second in the NL, and their WAR of 4.3 ranked third. And that bullpen will be the October beneficiary of the Dodgers\u2019 supreme rotation depth, with Kenta Maeda, Julio Urias, Dustin May, Tony Gonsolin and Rich Hill among the options to shift to the bullpen. Urias and May, in particular, could be high-leverage, high-velocity, late-game options from the left and right side, respectively.\n\nAD\n\nThe Year of the Home Run meets October pitching\n\nWhere the Dodgers appear to be most vulnerable is in the front end and the very back end of games. The rotation looks like a strength on paper, with lefties Clayton Kershaw and Hyun-Jin Ryu and right-hander Walker Buehler combining to go 44-14 with a 2.87 ERA \u2014 better than or equal to, at least on paper, the Nationals\u2019 top trio of Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin (43-20, 3.18). The Dodgers appear to have lined up Kershaw, Buehler and Ryu, in that order, to start the first three games of the Division Series.\n\nBut all three come with question marks, from Kershaw\u2019s diminished fastball velocity (career-low 90.4 mph this season) and checkered postseason track record (9-10, 4.32 ERA), to Buehler\u2019s inconsistency (six starts this season in which he gave up five or more earned runs, and nine in which he gave up zero), to Ryu\u2019s late-summer swoon (a four-start stretch from mid-August to early September in which he went 1-3 with a 9.95 ERA).\n\nAD\n\nIn the case of Ryu, some extra rest down the stretch appears to have set him straight \u2014 he posted a 1.29 ERA in his final three starts, with 21 strikeouts and no walks, but those three starts came on nine, seven and five days\u2019 rest, respectively, calling into question how frequently the Dodgers can use him in October.\n\nAD\n\nKershaw, meanwhile, made a surprise, one-inning relief appearance in Sunday\u2019s season finale \u2014 his first in the regular season in more than a decade \u2014 which may have been a dry run for more such deployments in October.\n\nAnd then there is closer Kenley Jansen, at one time arguably the top closer in the league but now coming off the worst season of his career and testing the faith of Manager Dave Roberts. The Dodgers have enough arms to compensate for Jansen\u2019s diminished effectiveness, but would they actually yank him out of his ninth-inning role? If Jansen was once a terrifying at-bat with the game on the line, nowadays he will almost certainly be an easier one than the pitcher who preceded him.\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals will start left-hander Corbin in Game 1 (and potentially Game 5). Corbin has absolutely owned the Dodgers over the past two seasons, going a combined 2-0 with a 0.59 ERA and 39 strikeouts in 30\u2153 innings, spanning five starts.\n\nAD\n\nFrom March: Patrick Corbin\u2019s tale sits between myth and reality\n\nThe Dodgers, in fact, are a much less potent lineup against lefties in general \u2014 despite Bellinger\u2019s dramatic improvement this year \u2014 with a team OPS that is almost 50 points lower than versus right-handers. That could mean a large role for lefty reliever Sean Doolittle, who has held the Dodgers to a .238/.273/.286 slash line in five appearances against them over the past three seasons. He also did not pitch in the wild-card game. But the Nationals may also wish they had additional lefty options to throw at the Dodgers in the late innings.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 fearsome front three of Scherzer, Strasburg and Corbin was one reason many considered them a scary first-round opponent for anybody, since that trio could start four of the five games on regular or extra rest. So the Nationals\u2019 plan for them coming out of the wild-card game will be interesting to watch.\n\nAD\n\nIf you are one who believes in clutch performance and pressure and intangibles, that might be the Nationals\u2019 best hope to pull off the upset. If there is any team under more pressure to win than the Nationals, who have yet to capture a postseason series since moving to Washington in 2005, it is the Dodgers \u2014 whose championship drought runs to 1988 and who suffered those painful World Series losses in 2017 and 2018.\n\nAs a source of comfort ahead of what should be a difficult series, it isn\u2019t much. But it\u2019s something.\n\nRead more:\n\nCharting the wildest season in Nationals history\n\nHow a humbling sweep set the Nationals straight\n\nMax Scherzer\u2019s catchers have a story to tell\n\nNew York to new life: How a humbling sweep set the Nationals straight\n\nEvery MLB playoff team\u2019s fatal flaw\n\nAD", "description": "Washington isn\u2019t necessarily incapable of beating Los Angeles three times across a span of three to five games.
