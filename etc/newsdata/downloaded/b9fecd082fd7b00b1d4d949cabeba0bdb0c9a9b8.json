It goes without saying that the average user enters this information under the assumption that it\u2019ll remain between them and the app \u2014 which, per a concerning new report from BuzzFeed News, may not hold true.\n\nAccording to new research from U.K.-based advocacy group Privacy International, some period-tracking apps have been directly sharing theirs users\u2019 highly personal data with tech behemoth Facebook and other third-party services. While many of the most popular menstruation apps, like Clue and Flo, were not incriminated by the findings, some of the ones that Privacy International found guilty of this practice have been downloaded millions of times. Maya by Plackal Tech, for example, has been downloaded more than 5 million times on Google Play, according to BuzzFeed News; MIA Fem, another app that has reportedly been sharing users\u2019 information, says on Google Play that more than 2 million people around the world use their services.\n\nWhat, exactly, would Facebook do with information about users\u2019 mood swings and menstruation? As noted by Privacy International, \u201cunderstanding people\u2019s mood is an entry point for manipulating them,\u201d with the manipulators in this scenario being advertisers. This reading is spot-on: According to the report, the menstruation apps share their users\u2019 data through Facebook\u2019s Software Development Kit (SDK), which helps the social-media platform target its users with specific ads. So, if you\u2019re telling you period-tracking app that you\u2019ve missed your period or are pregnant, you may start seeing ads for strollers and baby bottles.\n\nEven before Privacy International released its findings today, its investigation has had a positive impact on one period-tracking app\u2019s practices. In an email to the advocacy group, Plackal Tech said it has \u201chence removed both the Facebook core SDK and Analytics SDK from Maya.\u201d MIA, on the other hand, attempted to intimidate both Privacy International and BuzzFeed out of publishing their respective findings on MIA at all.\n\nWhile Facebook did not make any major promises, a spokesman for the site told BuzzFeed News that they \u201chave begun looking at ways to improve our system and products to detect and filter out more types of potentially sensitive data.\u201d Furthermore, the platform told the outlet that it has reached out to the apps incriminated in Privacy International\u2019s research to start discussions around ways they have potentially violated its terms of service.\n\nIn the meantime, might I suggest my favorite period, sex, and mood trackers: my planner and journal, which I guard with my life.\n\nStay in touch.
