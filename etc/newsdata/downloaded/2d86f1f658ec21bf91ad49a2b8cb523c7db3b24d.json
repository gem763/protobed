It is easy to cook and a great vehicle for robust flavours. Here, I toss fregola with mussels spiced with the pork salumi paste \u2019nduja for a simple, fast supper packed with flavour.\n\nSteamed mussels with fregola, \u2019nduja and baby tomatoes\n\nIf you are struggling to find fregola, the Middle-Eastern brand Zaytoun sell an almost identical sized couscous called maftoul, which is equally delicious.\n\nPrep 15 min\n\nCook 30 min\n\nServes 4-6\n\n3 tbsp olive oil\n\n1 large red onion, peeled and finely chopped\n\n3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped\n\nSalt\n\n250g fregola or maftoul\n\n300g baby tomatoes, halved\n\n200ml white wine\n\n40g \u2019nduja paste\n\n1.5kg mussels, thoroughly cleaned and de-bearded\n\n1 big handful parsley, chopped\n\nCrusty bread, to serve\n\nWarm the oil over a medium heat in a large, wide casserole or pan for which you have a lid (or that an upturned frying pan can snugly cover). Add the onion and garlic, season with a few pinches of salt, and sweat for 10 minutes, until softened.\n\nMeanwhile, bring a pan of salted water to a boil and cook the fregola, shaving two minutes off the cooking time stated on the packet (usually around 10-12 minutes): you are going to cook it again with the mussels and want to maintain some bite to the grains. Drain and set aside.\n\nAdd the tomatoes to the onions, simmer for two minutes, then stir in the wine, fregola and \u2019nduja. Turn up the heat and simmer for another two minutes, to allow the grains to absorb the flavours.\n\nNow add the mussels, put the lid on and cook for a further four to five minutes, shaking regularly, until the mussels have all opened (dead ones won\u2019t open and you must throw these away). Divide between bowls, sprinkle with the parsley and serve at once with crusty bread to mop up any stray juices.\n\nAnd for the rest of the week\n\nAny leftover \u2019nduja will transform many suppers: add to tomato sauces, heat and drizzle over pizzas or breakfast eggs, or even use to sauce a sauteed fillet of fish. Leftover fregola or maftoul can be turned into delicious autumnal salads, to accompany grilled vegetables or slow-cooked lamb.", "description": "A pasta-like grain adds bite to this quick dish of mussels tossed in a sauce made with with the last of the season\u2019s baby tomatoes and spicy pork salumi", "authors": ["Thomasina Miers"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ee0287f4d703f6a2e86c0d93501e26dfdbba5cc/0_290_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4a03ea679beae09ff8cc9937d752d04f", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
