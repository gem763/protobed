PRECIOUS-Gold gains on economic fears; investors focus on jobs report\n\n* Platinum on track for biggest weekly decline since May\n\n* Palladium to post weekly loss after eight weekly gains\n\nrunning\n\n* U.S. non-farm payroll data due at 1230 GMT\n\n\n\n(Updates prices, adds quotes)\n\nBy Diptendu Lahiri\n\nOct 4 (Reuters) - Gold prices rose for a fourth straight\n\nsession on Friday, buoyed by safe-haven sentiment after weak\n\nU.S. data deepened concerns over economic growth, with eyes now\n\nturning to a jobs report that could signal further U.S. rate\n\ncuts.\n\nSpot gold was up 0.3% at $1,508.64 an ounce at 0653\n\nGMT, having climbed in the previous session to its highest since\n\nSept. 25 at $1,518.50.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCcv1 were flat at $1,514.60.\n\nANZ analyst Daniel Hynes said the disappointing economic\n\nindicators from the United States in recent days were supporting\n\nsafe-haven buying.\n\nU.S. services sector activity slowed to a three-year low in\n\nSeptember amid rising concerns about tariffs, a survey showed on\n\nThursday, following a sucession of poor economic data this week.\n\n\n\nFocus now is on the U.S. non-farm payrolls report due at\n\n1230 GMT.\n\n\"If we see weaker than expected non-farm payroll data as\n\nwell, that will support gold prices and the momentum will be\n\npretty strong, provided it is backed up by Fed dovishness,\"\n\nHynes added.\n\nTwo U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers on Thursday signalled\n\nthey are open to delivering another rate cut, while Vice\n\nChairman Richard Clarida said the central bank \"will act as\n\nappropriate to sustain a low unemployment rate and solid growth\n\nand stable inflation\". \"Given the slowdown in the global economy and geopolitical\n\ntensions, if weak data coming out of U.S. prompts the Fed to cut\n\nrates once again, gold will have the potential to touch the\n\n$1,600 mark,\" said Vandana Bharti, assistant vice-president of\n\ncommodity research at SMC Comtrade.\n\nLower interest rates decrease the opportunity cost of\n\nholding non-yielding bullion and weigh on the dollar.\n\nThe U.S. dollar was flat against a basket of major\n\ncurrencies. USD/\n\nOn the trade front, meanwhile, new 25% U.S. tariffs on\n\nItalian cheese, French wine, Scotch whisky and thousands of\n\nother European food products will lead to higher prices ahead of\n\nthe holiday season and cost American jobs, trade groups said on\n\nThursday. Gold is widely considered a safe store of value during\n\neconomic and political uncertainty.\n\nAmong other precious metals, platinum XPT= fell more than\n\n1% to $881.05 an ounce and was down more than 4% this week,\n\nputting it on track for its biggest weekly decline since May.\n\nSilver gained 0.2% to $17.59 and palladium XPD=\n\nrose 0.4% to $1,659.64, set fopr a 1.5% fall on the week after\n\neight weekly gains.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold gains on economic fears; investors focus on jobs report", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED180L9_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
