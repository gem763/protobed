Also, who\u2019s to know what\u2019s actually going on in any individual case? It\u2019s impossible to tell if a person has a mental illness and needs help just by looking at them.\n\nAnd would it ever feel appropriate to approach someone in the gym who appears to be overweight, with concerns about their health? Exactly.\n\nHope developed anorexia when she was just 13 and a fixation on exercise was part of her illness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I had to do it at all hours, and at my worst, I would be running on the spot in my room into the early hours of the morning,\u2019 Hope tells Metro.co.uk.\n\n\u2018When you have an eating disorder so much of exercise is wrapped up in punishment.\n\n\u2018You have a bad day, so you go and work out more and the endorphins make you feel better \u2013 but you get obsessed with that feeling. You panic that if you aren\u2019t doing as much then your weight will increase.\u2019\n\nHope developed anorexia when she was 13 and exercise was always a big part of her illness (Picture: Conan Marshall)\n\nHope thinks that gyms can be incredibly dangerous places for people with eating disorders and says that better strategies need to be put in place to help members who are struggling.\n\n\u2018Gyms need a policy \u2013 but an open one,\u2019 says Hope.\n\n\u2018When I was unwell, my gym just used to call my mum and tell her \u2013 which only annoyed me and made me lie even more.\n\n\u2018With PTs, it is about them having education, getting them to ask the right questions, working out whether their clients are obsessed or exercising for the right reasons.\n\n\u2018Also periods \u2013 trainers should be able to ask these questions around periods. When I was over-exercising, mine stopped, and this happens to others too.\u2019\n\nIf you break your leg falling off a treadmill or pull your back trying to squat with a heavy weight, gyms have a policy. They know how to treat your injury, refer you to the necessary medical care and help you ease back into fitness as you recover.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy isn\u2019t mental illness treated in the same way? Surely duty of care for patrons should include any detrimental effects that can be caused by using the gym \u2013 physical or mental. Particularly when the two are so intricately linked, as with eating disorders.\n\nThe difficulty is that no two eating disorder cases look the same. And being underweight may not be the only warning sign \u2013 in fact, some people with eating disorders or exercise addiction aren\u2019t underweight at all.\n\n\u2018While young girls and women aged 12-25 are most at risk, eating disorders can affect anyone at any age,\u2019 explains Tom Quinn from Beat Eating Disorders.\n\n\u2018Boys and young men are more likely to use exercise rather than extreme dieting to control their body shape and size. Gyms should be aware of these behaviours and realise that it isn\u2019t just about being underweight.\n\nTom says that people with bulimia nervosa can also be over-exercising, and they are most likely to be at normal weight.\n\n\u2018We would like to see gyms and health clubs becoming more aware of eating disorders and put in place policies and safe working practices that would reduce the known risks,\u2019 adds Tom.\n\nGyms have no consistent consensus on how to tackle this problem (Picture: Ella Byworth)\n\n\u2018Policies could look at enrolment or membership systems and the types of health-related information collected; staff training; and ensuring confidential access to information and support for their clients and customers if necessary.\u2019\n\nExercise addiction is more common than you might think. Endorphins produced when you exercise strenuously affect the body in the same way as opioids, a bit like heroin. The resulting \u2018buzz\u2019 can become addictive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou might think that going to the gym all the time isn\u2019t exactly a problem, but it can be incredibly dangerous.\n\nExcessive exercise is hugely stressful on the body and can impair the immune system, lead to increased risk of infection, premature ageing, and injury. Couple that with a pre-existing eating disorder and things quickly become even more serious.\n\nSigns of exercise addiction Signs of exercise addiction include: Excessive training without sufficient breaks\n\nExercising even when injured\n\nPersistent muscle soreness\n\nFrequent exercise-related injuries\n\nExcessive weight loss\n\nPoor appetite\n\nIncreased infections\n\nInsomnia There will also be withdrawal symptoms when the exercise is stopped. These may include anxiety, depression, and restlessness. Dr Clare Morrison, GP and medical advisor at Medexpress\n\n\u2018It is now well recognised that exercise addiction is strongly associated with eating disorders, principally bulimia and anorexia nervosa. There is also an association with body dysmorphic disorder,\u2019 explains Dr Clare Morrison, GP and medical advisor at Medexpress.\n\n\u2018When exercise addiction is combined with an eating disorder, the risk is even greater. These people can appear surprisingly well, especially if they cover their thinness with baggy clothes.\n\n\u2018Those with anorexia can remain active until their reserves are dangerously depleted. In extreme cases, they may suffer fatal heart failure, with very little warning.\n\nDr Morrison says gyms are competitive environments that could \u2018normalise\u2019 excessive exercise behaviour.\n\n\u2018Gyms also make a lot of money from those keen to use their services,\u2019 she adds. \u2018Therefore it is likely that gyms may not try to stop their clients from exercising excessively when perhaps they should.\u2019\n\nNo two eating disorder cases look the same \u2013 being underweight may not be the only warning sign (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nSo, what are gyms doing at the moment?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe spoke to a number of well-known fitness facilities in the UK and found that, while attempts are being made at individual institutions, there is no consistent consensus on how to tackle this problem.\n\nVirgin Active told us that member safety is always top of their list of priorities. They say they work closely with UKActive and \u2018follow their duty of care as a fitness and health provider\u2019, but they were vague about their specific approach to eating disorders and exercise addiction.\n\n\u2018We give every new member a pre-activity health screening, where we work with the member to set an appropriate fitness plan to ensure they receive the best available advice and ongoing support,\u2019 said a spokesperson.\n\n\u2018Where possible and if appropriate, we are advised by a members\u2019 GP, as in certain situations, exercise can be detrimental to a condition. However, removing it from someone\u2019s routine can also hinder recovery.\u2019\n\nWhat to do if you're worried about someone at your gym Over-exercising is one of the signs of somebody suffering from an eating disorder \u2013 if a person is worried somebody is showing a sign of ED they should act quickly and get in touch with Beat or their GP. Our \u2018spot the signs\u2019 poster has been displayed in many GP practices, schools and community centres and gyms are welcome to contacts us if they would like to display one for their customers. We know that it can be very difficult to tell somebody you are worried about them having an eating disorder \u2013 you might feel like you\u2019re accusing the person of doing something wrong, or that it\u2019s insulting to them. But they haven\u2019t done anything wrong, and you\u2019re concerned for a reason. It\u2019s always better to approach the person with compassion and understanding so that they can get the help they need as soon as possible. Beat Eating Disorders\n\nAnytime Fitness told us that they take a detailed assessment of members at the induction stage, which aims to make staff aware of any pre-existing medical conditions \u2013 although that is dependent on members choosing to actually disclose that information.\n\nThey said that staff are automatically alerted if a member is coming to the gym too often \u2013 but they didn\u2019t specify what qualifies as \u2018too often\u2019, or would happen if that were the case.\n\n\u2018Anytime Fitness members can only access the gym via a fob which records when they visit,\u2019 said a spokesperson for the gym.\n\n\u2018All of this information is available electronically to the in-house team and highlights any members attending the gym too frequently. At this stage, clubs are alerted to contact the member.\u2019\n\nTraditional gyms are no longer the only venues for people to develop problematic relationships with exercise.\n\nThe boutique fitness sector is thriving and there are now more than 300 fitness studios in London alone. The good news is that the studios seem to have a more comprehensive approach to tackling mental health than the bigger, traditional gyms.\n\nBarry\u2019s Bootcamp is one of the originals. Its HIIT classes combine weights and cardio and are notoriously challenging. But they say that they are now getting tough on exercise addiction too.\n\n\u2018This year, we introduced mental health first aid training for every instructor,\u2019 says Barry\u2019s co-owner and master trainer Sandy Macaskill.\n\n\u2018It started off as a voluntary exercise but due to its success, and the feedback we got from the team, we have now made it compulsory. The training equips our instructors to be able to spot signs of poor mental health in one another and in clients who come to class.\n\n\u2018Exercise addictions can be difficult to spot because it is not about how much you exercise, it\u2019s about the motives behind it\u2019 (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\n\u2018Our instructors are now better-placed to offer assistance to Barry\u2019s clients who are at risk from a number of mental health issues and disorders and, where required, recommend expert help where necessary.\u2019\n\nBarry\u2019s recently appointed a mental health consultant and psychotherapist, Zoe Aston, who specialises in addiction and eating disorders. Zoe\u2019s job is to advise the company on how they can do better in looking after their team and community.\n\n\u2018Through things like mental health first aid training and bringing in experts such as myself, fitness and wellness brands are becoming increasingly able to spot when someone might be suffering \u2013 and more capable to offer support,\u2019 explains Zoe.\n\nZoe says that it is not the food or the exercise itself that cause the problem, but a build-up of unprocessed emotion that can lead to \u2018self-loathing\u2019 and a \u2018difficulty coping with life events\u2019.\n\nShe says intervention from gyms and studios can only really go so far: \u2018Although exercise communities must be careful not to enable self-destructive behaviour, only the individual and those very close to them can decide that something needs to change.\n\n\u2018Exercise addictions can be difficult to spot because it is not about how much you exercise, it\u2019s about the motives behind it.\n\n\u2018Someone can exercise every day of the week out of self-love and someone else can exercise every day of the week in order to punish themselves \u2013 they would look the same to the untrained eye.\u2019\n\nZoe says that it\u2019s vital that people in the industry are brave enough to have frank, honest conversations about mental health, and a good awareness about the range of different conditions.\n\n\u2018There are eating disorder sufferers of all shapes and sizes in every community and the main thing we can do is to make sure the community is safe enough that, if they want it, they can ask for help.\u2019\n\nBarry\u2019s has chosen to bring mental health support in-house. This feels like a positive step that could connect people to the help they need at the earliest stage possible.\n\nWhen Hope relapsed in 2016, she found that having an understanding PT who wasn\u2019t afraid to engage with her illness was really helpful in helping her manage her approach to exercise.\n\n\u2018She learnt what she had to say to me, to help with the nutrition, everything.\n\n\u2018I still see her, every six months or so, for a few sessions to help me stay on top of my exercise and to ensure I am doing it for the right reasons, and in the right way. She even pointed out last time I saw her that healthy doesn\u2019t mean thin. It is true!\u2019\n\nIf someone is unwell and addicted to exercise, the gym or a studio isn\u2019t the only place they could indulge in unhealthy behaviour.\n\nHope thinks it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to keep these people in safe spaces to give them the chance to get the support they need.\n\nHarsh measures like outright bans, approaching people directly mid-workout, or calling family members, she thinks, could lead to someone falling off the radar entirely and continuing to deteriorate without the possibility of intervention.\n\nBut gyms need to be equipped to cope with these problems sensitively and effectively \u2013 and that means looking at more than just the physical symptoms.\n\n\u2018Exercise can be really helpful in recovery and it is important that people have the chance to learn that and develop a healthy relationship with it,\u2019 says Hope.\n\n\u2018Mental health care in gyms is needed, but I think gyms, and society as a whole, are still too scared to take that responsibility.\n\n\u2018First off, it is about having resources available. We need to find a way to look beyond the physical symptoms and open up the wider discussions around mental health.\u2019\n\nWe also approached David Lloyd, Pure Gym and DW Fitness for comment \u2013 we will update this article if we get a response.\n\nMORE: Forever Aloners want you to know they\u2019re not the same as incels\n\nMORE: Sober October: Meet the people who say giving up alcohol is the best thing they\u2019ve done\n\nMORE: The fitness industry is overwhelmingly white \u2013 and that needs to change\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "What can gyms do if a member is addicted to exercise?
