Memes have become a vehicle for any information \u2015 good or bad \u2015 to be sanitized and launched into the mainstream, and the people making them know it.\n\n\u201cAfter Trump was elected president, you could often hear people in the so-called alt-right talk about how they memed Trump into the White House,\u201d said HuffPost senior reporter Christopher Mathias. \u201cThey were basically claiming a propaganda victory.\u201d\n\nWatch the video above to learn more.", "description": "Learn how internet memes became a super weapon in the propaganda war, morphing Pepe the Frog into a Trump-supporting Nazi.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter", "Senior Producer", "Producer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d82365a2400002e2a7db436.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
