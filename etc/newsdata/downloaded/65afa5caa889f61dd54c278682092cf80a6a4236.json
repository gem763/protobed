On September 20, as the valuation attached to the business tumbled, Galloway posted a follow-up, saying the business had \u201cgone from unicorn to distressed asset in 30 days.\u201d Ten days later, WeWork officially pulled the IPO.\n\nGalloway was back for more last weekend, arguing the WeWork episode had helped the market discern between overvalued unicorns \u2013 a list he says includes Uber, Twitter, Pinterest and Slack \u2013 and companies that could lose 80 per cent of their value or disappear.\n\nHis list of the latter includes WeWork, Indian hotel group OYO, Uber rival Lyft and stock trading app Robinhood.\n\nBut Galloway has also released a Youtube video examining the rapid rise of the buy now, pay later sector in the US, which is trailing a year or so behind the sector\u2019s Australian expansion.\n\nAnd ASX tech darling Afterpay was one of the three businesses under the microscope, along with its US rival, Affirm, and Swedish rival Klarrna (in which Commonwealth Bank has a stake).\n\nWhile Galloway\u2019s claim that the valuation of Afterpay and its two rivals could halve in the next 12 months is the obvious attention-grabber, he is far from dismissive of their success, pointing that 16 per cent of the 75 US retailers he tracks \u2013 including giant Wal-Mart \u2013 have already adopted these payment products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe says there are two key drivers of the sector\u2019s growth. Firstly, younger American consumers particularly cash strapped, with half of 30-year-olds making less than their parents did at their age. In this environment, four instalments of $20 over eight weeks, interest-free, can look less intimidating than one $80 amount on a credit card bill.\n\nThe other benefit is for retailers. \u201c[Credit] approval at the point of purchase increases basket sizes by 20 per cent to 30 per cent,\u201d Galloway says, praising what he describes as \u201csavvy marketing\u201d.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s a big \u201cbut\u201d here.\n\n\u201cAffirm, Afterpay and Klarna have smart businesses that capitalise on key consumer trends, but they have one major problem \u2013 a lack of moats,\u201d he says, referring to the Warren Buffett idea that strong businesses have competitive \u201cmoats\u201d that make them hard to displace.\n\n\u201cThese buy now, pay later have puddles rather than moats, which credit card companies can likely breach and step over.\u201d\n\nStocks 'will likely be halved in the next 12 months'\n\nGalloway argues that Visa\u2019s announcement in July that it would enter the buy now, pay later space later this year was very bad news for Afterpay, Affirm and Klarna.\n\nHe says card companies have strong instalment products in other markets \u2013 Brazil is a good example, where instalment-type products account for 50 per cent of the consumer credit market \u2013 and is it likely that Mastercard quickly follows Visa\u2019s lead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBrand identity goes a long way, and these companies have been explicit in targeting young professionals without credit cards. But they are likely over-valued,\u201d Galloway says, arguing that while Mastercard and Visa are valued at 18 times and 19 times revenue respectively, Afterpay is trading on 37 times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s suspect that Afterpay, whose clientele is Mastercard and Visa rejects, should trade at twice their multiples.\n\n\u201cThese stocks will likely be halved in the next 12 months as Visa rolls out its product and the entire market begins to shudder with yet another duopoly firm crushing competition.\u201d\n\nGiven Galloway\u2019s prescient assessment of WeWork, you\u2019d be silly to discount this view. And clearly, Mastercard and Visa are unlikely to cede this turf to disrupters.\n\nBut Galloway\u2019s prediction for Afterpay\u2019s share price feels more like a general statement his view on the sector rather than a detailed assessment of its business performance.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear to take into account, for example, Afterpay\u2019s growth trajectory in Australia (where an increasing proportion of its transactions are generated in-store rather than online, emphasising its ability to generate precious foot traffic for struggling retailers) or the potential for the business it is building in Britain.\n\nGalloway might also overestimate how easy it will be for Mastercard and Visa to make up ground on established players, even given the power of their duopoly.\n\nBut what\u2019s fascinating is Galloway\u2019s prescription for these disrupters who are about to be disrupted: Go harder and faster.\n\n\u201cThey are trading at exceptional multiples, they should be making acquisitions and massively reinvesting in the business and the relationships and turning those rivers and puddles into real moats,\u201d Galloway says.\n\nIt\u2019s something for Afterpay investors to ponder: Is growth or earnings more important for the company right now?", "description": "NYU professor Scott Galloway slammed WeWork's float and is now targeting the buy now, pay later sector, one with smart businesses and one big problem.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5607%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_127/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/01a63ed07a8aab9066ac3366151ecd790c4ba567", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
