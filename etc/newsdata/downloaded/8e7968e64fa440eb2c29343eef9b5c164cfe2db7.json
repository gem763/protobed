Scott Morrison has suggested unelected international institutions should not be setting the global agenda on issues like climate change and refugees. In a major foreign policy address to the Lowy Institute, Mr Morrison said Australia will lead by example in asserting the sovereignty and self-determination of nation-states over unelected international institutions like the United Nations. He also doubled down on his call for China to shoulder greater responsibility on the international stage. Image: Getty\n\nOne striking word popped up repeatedly during Scott Morrison\u2019s major foreign policy address last night.\n\nThat word was \u201cglobalism\u201d.\n\nThe Prime Minister was criticised during his recent trip to the United States for skipping a United Nations summit on climate change, which was being held in New York.\n\nHe alluded to that controversy in his speech at Sydney\u2019s Town Hall on Thursday night, delivering a quiet but scathing critique of \u201cinternational institutions\u201d that seek to \u201cimpose\u201d their views on sovereign nations.\n\n\u201cPragmatic international engagement, based on the co-operation of sovereign nation states, is being challenged by a new variant of globalism that seeks to elevate global institutions above the authority of nation states to direct national policies,\u201d said the Prime Minister.\n\nHe described it as \u201can era of insiders and outsiders\u201d, in which \u201celite opinion and attitudes have often become disconnected from the mainstream of their societies\u201d.\n\n\u201cAustralia does and must always seek to have a responsible and participative international agency in addressing global issues. This is positive and practical globalism. Our interests are not served by isolationism and protectionism,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut it also does not serve our national interests when international institutions demand conformity rather than independent co-operation on global issues.\n\n\u201cThe world works best when the character and distinctiveness of independent nations is preserved within a framework of mutual respect. This includes respecting electoral mandates of their constituencies.\n\n\u201cWe should avoid any reflex towards a negative globalism that coercively seeks to impose a mandate from an often ill-defined borderless global community. And worse still, an unaccountable internationalist bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nThose are defiant words, reminiscent of the rhetoric one might expect from Brexit advocates in the United Kingdom, or even from US President Donald Trump, who frequently throws around the term \u201cglobalist\u201d as an insult.\n\nIn fact, Mr Trump is arguably responsible for popularising the use of \u201cglobalism\u201d. Before his election win in 2016, you were far more likely to hear relatively neutral words like \u201cmultilateralism\u201d and \u201cinternationalism\u201d.\n\nDuring his speech to the UN last month, Mr Trump claimed globalism had \u201cexerted a religious pall\u201d over some world leaders and caused them to \u201cignore their own national interests\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe future does not belong to globalists. The future belongs to patriots,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Morrison echoed that argument to an extent, but took care to distinguish between what he called \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d globalism.\n\n\u201cGlobalism, in a positive light, it facilitates, aligns and engages, rather than directs and centralises,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOnly a national government, especially one accountable through the ballot box and the rule of law, can define its national interests. We can never answer to a higher authority than the people of Australia. And under my leadership, Australia\u2019s international engagement will be squarely driven by Australia\u2019s national interests.\u201d\n\nTo punctuate his point, Mr Morrison drew inspiration from one of John Howard\u2019s most memorable lines: \u201cWe will decide our interests and the circumstances in which we seek to pursue them.\u201d\n\nMr Morrison was on stage to deliver the Lowy Lecture \u2014 the annual flagship event of the Lowy Institute, a foreign affairs think tank.\n\nThe audience before him included some of Australia\u2019s brightest minds, dressed up for the prestigious occasion.\n\nListening intently among them was Mr Howard, who delivered the first ever Lowy Lecture back in 2005. Mr Morrison became the third Australian prime minister, after Mr Howard and Malcolm Turnbull, to headline the prestigious event.\n\nOther prominent past speakers have included German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, former CIA director David Petraeus and News Corp Chairman Rupert Murdoch.\n\nIn a speech that largely focused on Australia\u2019s place in the world, Mr Morrison also doubled down on his call for China to shoulder greater responsibility on the international stage, in line with its growing power as the world\u2019s second largest economy.\n\nHe further detailed his argument, first made in Chicago last month, that China should no longer be considered a \u201cdeveloping\u201d country under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.\n\nRELATED: Morrison takes aim at China\u2019s \u2018developing\u2019 country status\n\n\u201cChina is a global power making significant investments in military capability as a result of its extraordinary economic success,\u201d Mr Morrison said.\n\n\u201cIt is the major buyer of resources globally. It is having a profound impact on the regional balance of power. It\u2019s now the world\u2019s second largest economy, accounting for 16 per cent of world GDP in 2018. The world\u2019s largest goods exporter since 2009, and the world\u2019s largest trading nation since 2013. The world\u2019s largest manufacturer. The world\u2019s largest banking sector, the world\u2019s second largest stock market and the world\u2019s third largest bond market. Not bad for a developing country! And the world\u2019s largest holder of foreign reserves.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged Australia had benefited from China\u2019s economic rise \u2014 just as China had benefited from our reliable supply of energy, resources, agricultural goods and services.\n\n\u201cChina has in many ways changed the world,\u201d said the Prime Minister.\n\n\u201cSo we would expect the terms of its engagement to change too.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why when we look at negotiating rules of the future of the global economy, for example, we would expect China\u2019s obligations to reflect its greater power status. This is a compliment, not a criticism.\n\n\u201cAnd that is what I mean when describing China as a newly developed economy.\n\n\u201cThe rules and institutions that support global co-operation must reflect the modern world. It can\u2019t be set and forget.\u201d\n\nThink of all that as Mr Morrison\u2019s version of the \u201cwith great power comes great responsibility\u201d speech from Spider-Man.\n\nThe Prime Minister revealed he had directed the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) to conduct a \u201ccomprehensive audit\u201d of global institutions and rule-making processes, particularly those in which Australia has the greatest stake.\n\nThe WTO does not have a framework officially defining which countries are developing and which are already developed. Instead, nations are left to classify themselves as they see fit.\n\nAs a self-defined developing country, China receives a range of perks. For example, it gets more time to implement WTO commitments, benefits from procedural advantages in disputes, and gains access to subsidies in certain economic sectors.\n\nThis is a sore point for some other countries, particularly the United States. Mr Trump believes the size of the Chinese economy should disqualify it from such special treatment \u2014 and it seems he has an eager ally in Mr Morrison.\n\nChina, which is a great economic power, is considered a Developing Nation within the World Trade Organization. They therefore get tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 6, 2018\n\nThe Prime Minister solidified his already strong relationship with Mr Trump during a rare state visit to the United States late last month.\n\nHe was just the second international leader to receive such an honour \u2014 the other being French President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 since Mr Trump assumed office in January of 2017, and the first Australian prime minister since Mr Howard in 2006.\n\nRELATED: Scott Morrison addresses phone call with Trump\n\nRELATED: Trump and Morrison share unusually strong rapport\n\nRELATED: Glitz and glamour at Scott Morrison\u2019s state dinner\n\nMr Morrison was perhaps an appropriate choice for the Lowy Lecture, given how much of his early time as Prime Minister has been spent overseas.\n\nNevertheless, he told the audience at Sydney\u2019s Town Hall that his true interests were domestic.\n\n\u201cDespite my activities of the past year, I am not one who naturally seeks out summits and international platforms. But as Prime Minister, you must always be directed by the demands of the national interest. So much of Australia\u2019s future right now is being shaped by events and relationships well beyond our borders,\u201d Mr Morrison said.\n\nAnd he will be travelling beyond those borders again soon.\n\nThe Prime Minister used his address to confirm he would attend the inauguration of re-elected Indonesian President Joko Widodo later this month. He has also accepted an invitation from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit that country in January, and another from Japanese President Shinzo Abe. That trip is slated for sometime early next year.\n\nDuring a short question and answer session after the speech, Mr Morrison addressed his government\u2019s commitment to Mr Trump to co-operate with a US Justice Department investigation into the origins of the FBI\u2019s Russia probe in 2016.\n\nFormer Liberal leader and foreign minister Alexander Downer, of all people, is a central figure in that investigation, having communicated information he learned from Trump adviser George Papadopoulos \u2014 that Russia had dirt on Hillary Clinton \u2014 back to Canberra.\n\nThat information was then handed to US authorities, sparking the Russia investigation.\n\nMr Downer appears to have simply been doing his job as a diplomat. Some of Mr Trump\u2019s supporters feel his role was more sinister. Mr Papadopoulos himself has accused Mr Downer of being an \u201cFBI spy\u201d.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it inconceivable, the idea that someone like Mr Downer, a former conservative foreign minister, would be in cahoots with the deep state and various allied countries to intervene in the US election? Isn\u2019t it a ridiculous proposition?\u201d asked Michael Fullilove, the Lowy Institute\u2019s Executive Director.\n\n\u201cAlexander\u2019s always been a big lefty. Him and Nick Minchin, big lefties,\u201d Mr Morrison joked, drawing laughter from the crowd.\n\n\u201cI think not.\u201d\n\nFormer Liberal senator Nick Minchin was a prominent leader of the Liberal right for many years.\n\n\u201cLook, putting that to one side, the fundamentals of this are pretty straightforward.\n\n\u201cIt would be extraordinary of any prime minister to deny what was a very straightforward request.\u201d", "description": "One striking word popped up repeatedly during Scott Morrison\u2019s major foreign policy address last night.", "authors": ["Sam Clench"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f12a2e89aa5d4910fb722ee693a91f40?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
