(AP) - The Patriots have released tight end Ben Watson.\n\nThe team announced the move on Monday. It came shortly after Watson tweeted that he didn\u2019t do enough to earn a roster spot.\n\nWatson was eligible to make his debut for the Patriots against Washington on Sunday. But the 38-year-old wasn\u2019t activated after serving a four-game suspension for testing positive for a banned substance following the 2018 season.\n\nWatson planned to retire after last season but was courted by several teams. The Patriots eventually signed him to a one-year, $3 million deal as they looked to fill the hole created by the retirement of Rob Gronkowski.\n\nBut with Watson out the Patriots got by with 27-year-old Matt LaCosse and 23-year-old Ryan Izzo sharing snaps.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Patriots have released tight end Ben Watson.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
