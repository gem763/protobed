The through-line is obvious, even without historian David McCullough\u2019s introduction to the segment.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo me, the Statue of Liberty is like the light that\u2019s left on back home,\u201d he said. Being at the statue, he said, made \u201cyou feel something I think much more than just being an American. You feel the importance of being human. And you feel a kind of fraternal [bond] with everybody who has come here.\"\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s when the film transitions to the twins, identified as having come from the Soviet Union \u2014 at that point, of course, the fiercest international rival to the United States.\n\nAbove that identifier is the twins\u2019 family name: the Vindmans.\n\nBoth of those twins, Alexander and Yevgeny Vindman, ended up working for the White House under President Trump. Both Vindmans served in the U.S. Army, and both rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Each now works for the National Security Council.\n\nAD\n\nTheirs is, in the abstract, the quintessential American story. Migrants who arrived from the former Soviet Union at age 3 who\u2019ve since dedicated their lives to serving their new country. The Vindmans\u2019 experience is a manifestation of the poem at the base of the statue: They are part of the impoverished, huddled masses seeking the chance to breathe free. They did so, deeply.\n\nAD\n\nIn the estimation of the Trump administration, though, that famous poem has often been waved away \u2014 sometimes literally. In August, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ken Cuccinelli, was presented with the poem as an example of how the United States has long approached immigration.\n\n\u201cWould you also agree that Emma Lazarus\u2019s words etched on the Statue of Liberty, \u2018Give me your tired, give me your poor,\u2019 are also a part of the American ethos?\u201d Rachel Martin of NPR asked Cuccinelli.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey certainly are,\u201d he replied: \u201cGive me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s skepticism of immigrants \u2014 or, importantly, some immigrants \u2014 hardly bears reiterating. But that, too, serves as a through-line, in this case from his campaign announcement in 2015 through the campaign and into his presidency.\n\nAD\n\nAs with so many other parts of Trump's politics, that skepticism about some immigrants has permeated his cadre of public defenders and much of his base. And suddenly, Alexander Vindman finds himself the target of that skepticism.\n\nVindman will testify on Tuesday about having heard Trump cajole Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch investigations into former vice president Joe Biden, a possible 2020 opponent of Trump\u2019s. After hearing Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, link a meeting between Trump and Zelensky with those investigations in early July, Vindman raised concerns about the connection to the top attorney for the National Security Council.\n\nAD\n\nWhen news of Vindman's expected testimony broke on Monday night, the reaction from Trump's normal defenders was remarkably uniform: Vindman was suspect because he came from what is now Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nFox News host Laura Ingraham picked out Vindman's background and interactions with the Ukrainian government during her show.\n\n\u201cHere we have a U.S. national security official, who is advising Ukraine while working inside the White House, apparently against the president's interests, and usually they spoke in English,\u201d she said. \u201cIsn't that kind of an interesting angle on the story?\"\n\n\u201cI find that astounding,\u201d said former George W. Bush administration official John Yoo. \u201cAnd some people might call that espionage.\"\n\nAD\n\nYoo, who wrote post-9/11 legal opinions for Bush that were used to justify torturing terrorism suspects, is himself an immigrant from South Korea.\n\nTrump tuned in to Ingraham\u2019s program and offered some thoughts \u2014 including a claim that he\u2019d \u201cnever even heard of\u201d Vindman, a member of his White House team.\n\nAD\n\nWhy are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call. Just READ THE CALL TRANSCRIPT AND THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS OVER! Ukrain said NO PRESSURE. https://t.co/VYmW8bYcgS \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the rhetoric from Trump's defenders was more explicit.\n\n\u201cIf you look at this lieutenant colonel\u2019s background, he\u2019s got a Purple Heart, he got hit by an IED in Iraq,\u201d Brian Kilmeade said on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cWe also know he was born in the Soviet Union, immigrated with his family, young. He tends to feel simpatico with the Ukraine.\"\n\nAD\n\nOn CNN, former Wisconsin congressman Sean P. Duffy (R) suggested that Vindman\u2019s birthplace was important.\n\n\u201cIt seems very clear that he is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that he\u2019s concerned about American policy, but his main mission was to make sure that Ukraine got those weapons.\u201d\n\n(Of course, Ukraine\u2019s defense is still U.S. policy.)\n\n\u201cI understand that. We all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from,\u201d Duffy continued. \u201cLike me, I'm sure that Vindman has the same affinity. \u2026 He's entitled to his opinion. He has an affinity, I think, for the Ukraine. He speaks Ukrainian. He came from the country and he wants to make sure they're safe and free.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAsked whether Vindman was looking out for America first, Duffy demurred.\n\nThis idea of dual loyalty is something that Trump himself has raised. During his attacks on a group of Democratic lawmakers this summer for purportedly being anti-Semitic, Trump suggested that American Jews who support Democrats are being disloyal to Israel. He\u2019d made similar comments in the past.\n\nThe reaction to Vindman, though, reveals a fundamental hypocrisy in the Trumpian approach to immigrants. What Trump prioritizes in migrants who come to the United States is self-sufficiency and assimilation. He prefers migrants from Europe over Africa or the Middle East. What he wants is Alexander Vindmans \u2014 until Alexander Vindman points out where the loyalties of Trump himself might be questionable.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy family fled the Soviet Union when I was three and a half years old,\u201d Vindman\u2019s opening remarks read. \u201cUpon arriving in New York City in 1979, my father worked multiple jobs to support us, all the while learning English at night. He stressed to us the importance of fully integrating into our adopted country. For many years, life was quite difficult. In spite of our challenging beginnings, my family worked to build its own American Dream.\"\n\n\u201cI have a deep appreciation for American values and ideals and the power of freedom,\u201d the statement continues. \u201cI am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics.\"\n\nA phrase that would have been very much at home in that Ken Burns documentary about the Statue of Liberty.", "description": "Vindman is exactly the kind of immigrant Trump claims to like \u2014 until he puts country over president.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AVT6kQisQH4YOQgRDo9BZaWvals=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-29-2019/t_f46fbcba9e654c7eb546caf3c0771a1c_name_ef14c6be_fa4f_11e9_9e02_1d45cb3dfa8f_scaled.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
