This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that\u2019s like a left-wing fever dream,\u201d McCain said. \u201cAnd I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother\u2019s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he\u2019s not giving it back.\u201d\n\nBooker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O\u2019Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, \u201cGood! Because he\u2019s crazy!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should watch the way we talk about each other,\u201d Booker shot back. \u201cSeriously, we can\u2019t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.\u201d\n\nMcCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O\u2019Rourke \u201chas no problem doing it to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was very nasty to me about this,\u201d the ex-Fox News star lamented.\n\nLast month, reacting to McCain\u2019s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to \u201ca lot of violence\u201d from gun owners, O\u2019Rourke said \u201cthat kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful\u201d and it could become \u201cself-fulfilling\u201d and give permission to violence.\n\n\u201cYou and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn\u2019t mean we show the same thing back to them,\u201d Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not running for president, with all due respect,\u201d McCain snapped back. \u201cAnd the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there\u2019s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.\u201d\n\nThe New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that \u201cwhat we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.\u201d\n\nBooker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter\u2019s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he\u2019s going to take her brother\u2019s guns.\n\nAfter a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they\u2019d continue the conversation in the next segment.\n\n\u201cNo we\u2019re not,\u201d McCain grumbled. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
