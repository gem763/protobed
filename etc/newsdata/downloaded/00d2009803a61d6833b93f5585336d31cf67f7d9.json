It is a class designed to stop us falling over, part of the Dance to Health programme being pioneered across England for the over-50s.\n\nBased on physiotherapy exercises and dance routines, it\u2019s supposed to prevent tumbles, and boost mobility and co-ordination. It\u2019s supposed to be fun, too.\n\nAngela Neustatter, 76, (pictured) tried a class from the Dance to Health programme, designed to prevent us from falling over\n\nBut, dear me, what is going on? I had fondly imagined I would be a bit of a star performer. After all, I do a good deal of Pilates and yoga and, at one point, my other half and I went through a craze for tango.\n\nBut here I am being outdone by my Birmingham classmates.\n\nSome are markedly younger than my 76 years, but others have a decade on me, and even the man with acute arthritis and a walking stick seems to be keeping up better than I am.\n\nOur teacher, Jenny Murphy, 38, trained and danced with Birmingham Royal Ballet and has been leading Dance to Health classes since it started in 2017. Classes have since sprung up in Cheshire, Norfolk, Oxfordshire, South Wales and Yorkshire.\n\n\u2018Some people have incapacitating arthritis and are very limited in mobility,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018Some have had one or two hip replacements, others have become increasingly anxious about falling when they go out, so it\u2019s important the exercises build strength and confidence.\u2019\n\nJenny adds: \u2018Music and dance make what we do enjoyable, as well as help spatial sense and co-ordination. Dancing together with music to lift the spirits builds social bonds, too.\u2019\n\nMy session is set to George Gershwin\u2019s hits. We begin with warm up exercises \u2014 shoulder shrugs, leg lifts, arm stretches \u2014 then, before I have time to say pas de deux, we are asked to walk, alternating on toes then heels around the room.\n\nAdded on is a port de bras where we hold our arms out wide in a (hopefully graceful) ballet pose.\n\nThe Dance To Health programme is the brainchild of social enterprise charity Aesop\u2019s chief executive Tim Joss, Victoria (pictured) tried a session taught by dancer Jenny Murphy, 38,\n\nThere are double side-steps across the floor, designed to raise the aerobic heartbeat, and next we are into a swaying motion with a high-stepping march, walking feet directly in front of each other \u2014 much harder than it sounds.\n\nThen we try the flamingo swing: standing on one leg, raising the other and brushing it backwards and forwards. And guess who wobbles the most . . .\n\nA third of people aged 65 and over and half of those aged 80-plus fall at least once a year. Falls result in an annual bill for the NHS of \u00a32.3 billion.\n\nAn evaluation by Sheffield Hallam University showed a 44 per cent reduction in the number of falls among those participating in Dance to Health, along with a growth in confidence and independence, and significant improvement for people who suffer with isolation and loneliness.\n\nAt the end of each session is a 30-minute gathering with coffee and cake, and this is where friendships are often made.\n\nVictoria (pictured) says her session left her wanting to come back for more, bonded groups have been known to put on performances\n\nThe Dance to Health programme, held in six regions around England and in Wales, was the brainchild of social enterprise charity Aesop\u2019s chief executive Tim Joss, who asked the Arts Council to link professional arts organisations with physiotherapy-based classes as a way to make them more engaging and fun than plain exercise classes might be.\n\nAesop\u2019s programmes have had NHS funding for their induction phases, and GPs can refer patients. After this, the maintenance and sustainability phases rely on fundraising by the individual groups. Tim Joss plans the first three years of Dance to Health to be followed by a drive to reach 10,000 people. \u2018I am passionately determined that older people anywhere in the country have the chance to do Dance to Health,\u2019 he says.\n\nSo bonded do groups become that they sometimes put on performances, or \u2018celebrations\u2019, as Jenny calls them. Her group performed a ballroom sequence to Prokofiev\u2019s Romeo and Juliet for an Aesop conference, for example, while a Norwich group were trained for a performance of a short dance piece at the city\u2019s Theatre Royal.\n\nMy hour-long session ends with us each being asked to create a movement to music for others to follow, and as I prance out the room humming to the music, I rather wish I could come back for more.\n\nBEST MOVES TO BOOST YOUR STABILITY AT HOME\n\nFormer Birmingham Royal Ballet ballerina Jenny Murphy takes you through some balance-boosting moves. Until you\u2019ve developed core stability, do not attempt these without someone to support you.\n\n1. WARM UP Always begin with warmup exercises. Stand firmly on both of your feet and try shoulder shrugs, leg lifts and arm stretches.\n\n2. THE STEP OVER Practise stepping over an object like a slipper \u2014 you can support yourself with a chair if necessary. Turn around and do it again.\n\n3. THE TOE-HEEL MOVE Walk around the room, alternating on toes and heels \u2014 use your stomach muscles for support.\n\n4. THE SLOW STROLL Walk in a straight line, placing feet directly in front of each other. It is harder than it sounds. Start slowly and build speed.", "description": "Angela Neustatter, 76, tried out a class from the Dance to Health programme, designed to stop us from falling over.
