Another brother, Jordie Barrett, is on the reserves bench.\n\nThe All Blacks topped Pool B here, opening with a 23-13 win over South Africa, and has been steadily building momentum in its bid for a third consecutive title.\n\n\u201cThe team is exactly where we want to be, mentally and physically,\u201d New Zealand head coach Steve Hansen said. \u201cThe word \u2018pressure\u2019 is bandied around quite readily, however, that pressure is always there. It\u2019s about how you handle that in the moment and not getting distracted by the past or the future.\u201d\n\nHansen said Cane\u2019s move to the reserves was \u201cnot on form \u2026 (he\u2019s) playing lovely rugby.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made some decisions around how we want to play, and we\u2019ve made that change because of it,\u201d Hansen said. Referring to Scott Barrett, he added: \u201cObvious thing, he\u2019s a lineout forward. He\u2019s a ball carrier \u2026 enhances our ball-carrying ability.\u201d\n\nHansen also echoed comments made by England coach Eddie Jones last weekend about rugby now being more than 15-man starting side.\n\n\u201cThe bench is so important in today\u2019s game \u2026 we always talk about 23,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cYou need 23 to get the job done. There\u2019s still a thought process where the best players always start. That\u2019s not always the case. Some guys are better finishers than starters. We\u2019re fortunate we\u2019ve got some big hitters on the bench. They\u2019ll get a great opportunity.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand hasn\u2019t lost a game at the Rugby World Cup since an upset defeat to France in 2007, and has won all three previous meetings against England at the sport\u2019s marquee event.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived at this point with vastly different experiences from previous Rugby World Cups,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cNo doubt, those experiences will resurface throughout the week and even in the game itself.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s extra-time win over Australia in the 2003 final remains the northern hemisphere\u2019s only World Cup title.\n\nNew Zealand captain Kieran Read missed a training session earlier in the week because of a leg soreness but has recovered to take his place at No. 8 in a backrow featuring Ardie Savea and Scott Barrett.\n\n___\n\nNew Zealand: Beauden Barrett, Sevu Reece, Jack Goodhue, Anton Lienert-Brown, George Bridge, Richie Mo\u2019unga, Aaron Smith; Kieran Read (captain), Ardie Savea, Scott Barrett, Sam Whitelock, Brodie Retallick, Nepo Laulala, Codie Taylor, Joe Moody.
