It\u2019s pushing understanding and, to me, that\u2019s not an agenda. That\u2019s what this world should have, anyway, and the fact that we get to do that and I get to be a part of that message is, honestly, really, really awesome,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope one day people can see something like this and it will just be completely normal.\u201d\n\nAfter all, people don\u2019t spend much time talking about Batman\u2019s heterosexuality, she pointed out.\n\nBatwoman is a homecoming of sorts for Skarsten, who starred in Birds of Prey, a 2002-03 show based on another DC Comics property.\n\n\u201cIt was a female-led cast, three very strong women and the three of us joke to this day that had that show premiered now, it would probably be on the air seven years,\u201d Skarsten said in a separate interview.\n\nShe went on to say that having powerful women in the entertainment industry and telling stories about women means men should be excluded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really wonderful to have a place for everyone and I think we can all play into each other\u2019s strengths,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see there are more really strong women doing their thing and I hope Batwoman will be a small part \u2014 or maybe a large part \u2014 in ushering in a new era of strong females.\u201d\n\nTremendous care went into Skarsten\u2019s portrayal of the villain Alice.\n\n\u201cYou can go too far with crazy. It has to be nuanced,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is unnerving and unhinging for us as human beings? For me, it\u2019s when someone seems very normal and, on a dime, can switch. So, I tried to do that with Alice.\u201d\n\nAlice\u2019s relationship with her twin sister has been interesting to explore and develop.\n\n\u201cYou are taking two females who are evenly matched in ever way \u2014 in their physicality, in their intelligence and all these things and now they are foes\u2026 but they can\u2019t really destroy one another because they are family and they love each other and they have this incredible bond that they\u2019ve had from pre-birth to the age of 13,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very fun.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 6 (UPI) \u2014 Teen Wolf alum Meagan Tandy said she was excited to join the cast of Batwoman because it is largely written by women and focuses on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
