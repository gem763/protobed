After seeing parents Vinnie and Tanya\u2019s utter devotion first hand, she is in no doubt of its power.\n\nTanya may have lost her six-year battle with cancer at just 53 but Kaley says her inspiration will live for ever.\n\n\u201cMy parents taught me the meaning of real love,\u201d she says. \u201cThat will never die.\u201d\n\nIn her first interview, the 32-year-old tells of her heartache at looking after her grieving dad \u2013 but also of her vow to marry her partner in honour of her parents\u2019 \u201ctrue love story\u201d.\n\nDespite meeting as teens, they only got together years later. But from that moment, Vinnie and Tanya were smitten and became one of showbusiness\u2019s most enduring romances.\n\nAs a child and a teen, Kaley \u2013 who was adopted by Vinnie \u2013 watched her parents\u2019 love remain as fervent, deep and playful as when they met.\n\nShe says: \u201cThe way those two were, I thought it was normal because it was all I knew. It was good for me. They taught me a lot about what love is and were certainly still romantic.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror Collect)\n\n\u201cI always watched them give each other little love notes, they left cards on each other\u2019s pillows. Mum always said that was really important.\n\n\u201cShe taught me to keep love, she said when you have got something special, the way to hold on to it is to nurture and respect the love. She said you have to lift your partner up and she did that with my dad very well.\n\n\"She was someone he was able to be his complete self with. He talked to her about everything, asked her opinion on everything. If he wasn\u2019t in the country, they were FaceTiming, texting. She looked after him, kept him grounded. It was like she tamed him.\u201d\n\nBut they faced devastating news when Tanya was diagnosed with cancer in 2013. And Kaley was present in their darkest moments, quitting her job as a therapist to give round-the-clock care.\n\n\u201cEven in hospital, she was talking about their upcoming 25th wedding anniversary,\u201d Kaley says. \u201cShe was talking about how in love they were. Every doctor or nurse, she would tell them their love story.\u201d\n\nTanya died in July after the cancer, which began as melanoma, spread to her brain. Despite her own grief, Kaley has focused on 54-year-old Vinnie\u2019s too, reminding him to do even the most basic tasks as he tries to come to terms with the loss of his soulmate.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror Collect)\n\n\u201cHe needs me to look after him,\u201d Kaley says, \u201cdoing everything she would, making sure he is eating, that his clothes are getting dry cleaned, because he has never lived on his own.\u201d\n\nKaley now plans to marry her own partner, chef Lauren Keefe, 32, and hopes they can share the kind of joy her parents knew. She says: \u201cWhen Lauren told Mum her face lit up and she said, \u2018Do you have a ring?\u2019.\n\n\u201cBut Lauren didn\u2019t. So my mum said, \u2018She would like something simple. Nothing like my ring.\u2019 My dad got her a ring last Christmas. It was pink diamonds and Mum kept it by her bed. She would kiss it and pray into it. It\u2019s really blingy, the opposite to what I would want.\u201d\n\nTanya had a heart transplant aged 21, shortly after Kaley was born.\n\nLauren asked Tanya's blessing for Kaley\u2019s hand in marriage just a few days before she passed away.\n\nKaley said: \"Lauren vowed to Mum that she would take care of me the way Mum took care of my dad.\u201d\n\nShe recently found journals her mum wrote during that difficult time.\n\n(Image: Tim Merry)\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\n\u201cMy mum documented the experience of giving birth to me in her diaries,\u201d she says. \u201cShe wrote about how she no longer feared death but had a strong desire to live.\n\n\u201cShe wrote that she looked at the other patients and knew everyone was dying but what she didn\u2019t know is if they had as strong a desire to live as she did because she believed she was supposed to live to be my mum.\n\n\"She wrote a poem to me when I was three saying I was everything she dreamed I could be. It read, \u2018Never be afraid to die because I will be waiting for you in the sky\u2019.\n\n\"She was grateful she got to be my mum as long as she did. When you look at her medical history, she was defying the odds.\n\n\u201cShe never complained or showed that she was afraid.\u201d\n\nAnd Kaley takes solace in knowing Tanya saw her achieve what she always hoped for her.\n\n\u201cThe one thing Mum wanted for me, I know she knows I have found \u2013 true love.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE Kaley Jones, 32, is now starting her own love story as she prepares to marry Lauren Keefe - inspired by her parents powerful devotion to one another", "authors": ["Geraldine Mckelvie", "Halina Watts", "Image", "Daily Mirror Collect", "Tim Merry", "Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20531724.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Vinnie-JonesA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
