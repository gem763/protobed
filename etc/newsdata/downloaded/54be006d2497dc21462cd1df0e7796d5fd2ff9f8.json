My dad is a boxer and my mum is a pub.\"\n\nShe added: \"Just got my lips done. I asked the doctor for an allergic reaction.\"\n\n(Image: NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)\n\nA voice-over tells the audience: \"You've heard an English accent. You've heard an Irish accent. Now here all the little weirdies in between.\"\n\nWhat followed was a collection of terrible Liverpudlian, Irish and Scottish accents.\n\nPhoebe continued, in classic Love Island style: \"I would like to couple up with a guy who's exactly my type on paper.\"\n\n(Image: NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)\n\nShe describes her perfect man: \"He's got tattoos, he's got really great banter, he's proper fit. But at the same time, I;d go with anyone...\"\n\nA fellow contestant introduces themselves as being \"from Murder-Suicide, England,\" while another hails \"from the part of Ireland where the soil is bones.\"\n\nPhoebe's been flying high across the pond, after she scooped up a mighty three Emmys in one night, including Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.\n\nShe's the star of the hugely popular Fleabag, which she brought to a close after the second series.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nDuring her SNL monologue, she laughed: \"Back in the day, horny women were to be feared - now they're given Emmys.\"\n\nPhoebe also mentioned her other hit show Killing Eve , which follows a psychopath played by Jodie Comer.\n\nShe said: \"I'm not a sex addict because I wrote Fleabag - but I did write Killing Eve because I'm a psychopath.\"\n\nWhen asked by talk show host Seth Meyers if Fleabag would make a return, Phoebe admitted that she had considered it - but when she's 50.\n\nPhoebe dished: \"I quite like the idea of coming back to her, well me, when I'm 50.\n\n\"Because I feel like she would have had more life then and God knows what she would have got up to.\n\n\"Actually seeing a character like that in a later stage of life is exciting. But for now she has been through enough, we've got to let her go.\"\n\nThe Fleabag one woman show has been running since 2013, and she's had another wildly successful summer in the West End.", "description": "Phoebe pouted her lips, put on an Essex accent and slapped on the fake tan for the sketch show she was hosting", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Nbcu Photo Bank Via Getty Images", "Pa", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20528452.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Screen-Shot-2019-10-06-at-104911.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
