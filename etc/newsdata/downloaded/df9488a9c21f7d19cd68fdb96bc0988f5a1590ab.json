It also has other offices across China, and globally, including Silicon Valley.\n\nCNBC recently took a tour of the company's main Hangzhou headquarters \u2014 Xixi campus, which is home to about 22,000 of its 100,000 global employees. Its main campus is also where its corporate office, as well as its major e-commerce brands Tmall, Taobao, and AliExpress, are at.\n\nAlibaba was started as an e-commerce platform 20 years ago by Jack Ma, who recently stepped down as the company's chairman.
