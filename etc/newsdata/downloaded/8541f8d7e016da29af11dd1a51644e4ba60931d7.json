He was also perhaps the most wanted terrorist leader in the world and the highest ranking since the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011.\n\nMore: Donald Trump announced an ISIS leader was killed in a U.S. raid. Who was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi?\n\nA spokesperson for the paper, Kristine Coratti Kelly, later tweeted \"Regarding our al-Baghdadi obituary, the headline should never have read that way and we changed it quickly.\"\n\nCritics including members of Trump's family and Republican officials quickly accused The Washington Post of softening its description of al-Baghdadi out of disdain for the president.\n\nEvery day The Washington Post uses harsher words against @realDonaldTrump than they do in writing about one of the world\u2019s most evil terrorists. Yet we\u2019re supposed to take them at face value. Let that sink in. pic.twitter.com/iIWVqI4N8B \u2014 Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) October 27, 2019\n\nEnemy of the people???

Unfortunately, a headline written in haste to portray the origins of al-Baghdadi and ISIS didn't communicate that brutality.
