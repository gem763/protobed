It seems odd, doesn't it?\" said Lemon, who is black. \"Because we have one who doesn't.\"\n\nLater in his program, Lemon added: \"We don't often see that here, especially in a world leader who is saying 'I should've known better and I'm sorry.' You can feel about it however you want, but that, to me, that does mean a lot.\"\n\nBy Thursday morning, after more images had surfaced, the left-leaning Daily Beast site was less upbeat, declaring Trudeau's \"progressive reputation \u2026 in ruins.\"\n\nScant international coverage\n\nThough strong reactions could be found on social media, further abroad the Trudeau story was covered no more than, say, the Israeli election or the death of Tunisian autocrat Ben Ali.\n\nTrudeau was not on the top story page of Israel's Haaretz or Jerusalem Post, and the story merited only \"world\" page coverage on the sites of the Times of India and Italy's Corriere Della Sera (with a stock picture of Trudeau, no less, in the latter case).\n\nNews 24 in South Africa, NDTV in India and Le Figaro in France addressed the story on their main pages, but hardly with what one would call prominent placement.\n\nReporters Salimah Shivji and Aaron Wherry join host \u00c9ric Grenier to discuss how Justin Trudeau's brownface and blackface revelations have changed the campaign. And former N.B. premier Brian Gallant talks about the electoral battlegrounds in Atlantic Canada. 28:05\n\nIn Australia, the scandal ranked fifth or sixth on the Sydney Morning Herald's 10 most viewed stories \u2014 behind both a controversial report a rock singer's alleged bondage club habits, and a story about tensions in the Middle East.\n\nBack in the U.K., the Guardian's international edition rated Trudeau as the No. 2 most viewed story, but it wasn't rating at all on the site's traditional home page (which still features international news).", "description": "The revelation that Justin Trudeau donned brownface for a costume party in 2001 landed too late on Wednesday night to make the print editions of many international publications, but reaction has since picked up around the globe.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5290093.1568924114!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/trudeau-headlines.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
