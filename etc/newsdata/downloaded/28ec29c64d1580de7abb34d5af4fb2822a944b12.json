(Picture: Getty Images)\n\nDiwali is often referred to as the \u2018Hindu Festival of Lights\u2019 but it is also celebrated by Sikhs and it is an important day for those who follow Sikhism around the world.\n\nTo be totally accurate, Sikhs are not actually celebrating Diwali, they are celebrating Bandi Chhorh Divas, which means \u2018Prisoner Release Day\u2019 which happens to be at the same time of year as Diwali, so the two are amalgamated.\n\nEngland rugby fans jubilant after stunning 19-7 semi-final win over New Zealand\n\nPrisoner Release Day is the celebration of the sixth Guru, Guru Hargobind Sahib, being released from Gwalior Prison in India along with 52 princes in 1619.\n\nThe day is seen as a triumph of right over wrong and a tribute to the Guru who saved the lives of the 52 men without violence.\n\nBandi Chhorh Divas is hugely important for Sikhs (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nIt is believed that the sixth Guru, along with hundreds of others, was held as a political prisoner by the Mughals, despite being otherwise innocent of any crimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Mughal Emperor Jahangir met with Guru during his imprisonment and became close to him \u2013 partly because the Guru saved him from a lion whilst out hunting, but also because the Guru\u2019s prayers were thought to have cured the Emperor of a serious illness.\n\nSuch was the debt the Emperor owed Guru Hargobind, he agreed to release him but the Guru refused to accept unless he could take 52 princes (Rajas) with him.\n\nThe Emperor was at first reluctant, but agreed to letting any prisoners free who could hold onto the Guru\u2019s cloak, thinking this would serious limit the number.\n\nHowever, the Guru outsmarted the Emperor by creating a cloak made with 52 tails (reported as pieces of string in some places) so all the Rajas could hold on and walk to freedom with him.\n\nThe Golden Temple in Amritsar, India.
