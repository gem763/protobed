Trump\u2019s surprise decision to abandon the Kurds and sign off on Turkey\u2019s operation in Syria drew condemnation in the West, but was cheerfully welcomed in Russia, and, for those who follow Russia closely, the contrast revived the ghosts of Helsinki, where Trump\u2019s surrender of American values was on full display.\n\nThere in Finland last year, the leader of the most powerful country in the world demonstrated cringeworthy servility toward Vladimir Putin\u2014president of a rogue government sanctioned by the West for a great number of malign activities, including Russia\u2019s brazen interference in the U.S. elections.\n\nThe world\u2019s pariah looked triumphant next to the deflated American president. As Trump stood hunched over, with a blank expression, Putin was practically glowing\u2014and he wanted the world to know just how great the meeting went for Russia. Putin held up a thick stack of his notes with both hands, showing them off for the world to see, in effect giving himself the thumbs-up.\n\nDiscernible portions of the first page, purposely written in abnormally large script, included references to the election interference, Putin\u2019s request that Russia be allowed to interrogate the former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, and also the British businessman Bill Browder, pursuant to the 1999 Treaty with Russia on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters. There was a reference to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. And at the bottom of the first page, Putin\u2019s notes also mentioned Syria, where Russia has been wreaking havoc and committing mass atrocities in concert with Syrian dictator Bashar Assad and Iran.\n\nFor public consumption, the Russian president\u2019s handwriting mentioned \u201cjoint humanitarian operations with the goal of creating conditions for the return of refugees.\u201d The reality on the ground tends to create\u2014not dissipate\u2014the flood of refugees, essentially weaponized by Russia and Syria to destabilize Europe.\n\n\u201c The prevailing talking point in the Russian state media is that Trump\u2019s actions have proven what Russia has been repeating for years: 'Americans can\u2019t be trusted.' \u201d\n\nOn Wednesday this week, President Trump nonchalantly commented that if the thousands of ISIS prisoners that are currently being held by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces escape, \"they will be escaping to Europe.\" Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is also threatening Europe with a flood of refugees, publicly proclaiming, \u201cWe will open the gates and send 3.6 million refugees your way.\u201d\n\nMystery surrounds the rest of the topics discussed by the President of the United States with the Russian leader in Helsinki, since President Trump confiscated the American interpreter\u2019s notes and remains tight-lipped about his exchanges with Vladimir Putin. But one thing is clear: Trump is moving down Putin\u2019s wish list, fulfilling the Kremlin\u2019s aims at a rapid pace. He is chipping away at U.S. sanctions against Russia, deepening America\u2019s internal divisions on the basis of race, faith, sexual orientation and political affiliation, vocally undermining confidence in our elections, intelligence agencies and institutions, all the while empowering our foreign adversaries and undermining NATO alliances.\n\n\u201c Even Russian experts are amazed at the damage Trump is willfully inflicting. \u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s claims that Ukraine\u2014not Russia\u2014 is somehow responsible for the 2016 election interference fall right in line with conspiracy theories the Kremlin has been propagating for years. The Russians have long been promoting the notions that prompted President Trump\u2019s outrageous demands from the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, ultimately leading to the commencement of the impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe ousting of Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, was also in line with the Kremlin\u2019s wishes. She stood up for Ukraine\u2019s interests, opposing Russia\u2019s aggressive posture with respect to Donbas. Ukrainian politician Viktor Medvedchuk, a close ally of Russia's Vladimir Putin\u2014who is the godfather of Medvedchuk\u2019s daughter\u2014has a longstanding grudge against Ambassador Yovanovitch. Medvedchuk cheered for the U.S. Ambassador to be recalled and the Russian state media predicted that Ambassador Yovanovitch would be Trump\u2019s \u201cfirst victim in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s fingerprints seem to appear on every controversial foreign policy decision undertaken by President Trump. Prior to Turkey\u2019s ongoing offensive against the Kurds, Turkish President Erdogan met with his Russian and Iranian counterparts, reaching \"important decisions.\"\n\nAll three leaders avoided providing specifics on the talks. Russian state media proudly boasted that Erdogan secured Putin\u2019s approval for Turkey\u2019s offensive in northern Syria before speaking to Trump. Vladimir Soloviev, the host of the nightly program The Evening With Vladimir Soloviev on Russian state television, said that the Turkish president ran his plans by his Russian counterpart, securing his approval during their personal exchanges.\n\nSoloviev added sarcastically that Erdogan was \u201cnot quite as delicate\u201d with the president of the United States, implying that the American president was simply put on notice as to the deals that were already struck by Turkey, Russia and Iran.\n\nThe prevailing talking point in the Russian state media is that Trump\u2019s actions have proven what Russia has been repeating for years: \u201cAmericans can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d Evgeny Poddubny, a military correspondent for Russian state-owned Channel 1 (VGTRK), said that after being \u201cstabbed in the back by the Americans,\u201d the Kurds have nowhere else to turn except to Russia. Now that the U.S. is seemingly abdicating its influence in the Middle East, Russia is readily stepping into the void, offering to facilitate the negotiations between the Kurds and the Assad regime.\n\n\u201c I never thought I\u2019d live to see this ... Washington is doing everything to break down the foundations of transatlantic alliance and unity. \u201d \u2014 Tatyana Parkhalina, Association for Euro-Atlantic Cooperation\n\nEven Russian experts are amazed at the damage Trump is willfully inflicting. Appearing on Russian state television show 60 Minutes last year, Tatyana Parkhalina, President of the Association for Euro-Atlantic Cooperation, said as if she were incredulous: \"I never thought I\u2019d live to see this\u2014not the USSR nor Russia, who tried many times to drive the wedge between transatlantic allies, but Washington is doing everything to break down the foundations of transatlantic alliance and unity.\" Last year, the idea of the U.S. pullout from Syria seemed too good to be true. Now, the Kremlin\u2019s ambitions are coming to fruition.\n\nPundits and experts appearing on the nightly television show The Evening with Vladimir Soloviev, concurred that anti-American analysts couldn\u2019t even dream of a situation where the umbrella of American influence in Syria would be retracted. They speculated that China will take advantage of this situation and get more involved in the Middle East.\n\nSemyon Bagdasarov, director of the Moscow-based Center for Middle Eastern and Central Asian Studies, asserted that if he were serving in the armed forces of the United States, he would consider President Trump a traitor. Bagdasarov was perfectly blunt:: \u201cTrump is a traitor to the American people.\u201d Host Vladimir Soloviev chimed in: \u201cThen you should support him... If it\u2019s bad for America, you should support him.\u201d Russian expert Vladimir Avatkov added: \u201cLet\u2019s hope that this will lead to Turkey leaving NATO. Let\u2019s hope for that to happen.\u201d Appearing on the same show, analyst Dmitry Drobnitsky suggested: \u201cHere it is, the multipolar world... We\u2019re witnessing the beginning of a new era.\u201d", "description": "Trump tried to keep his talks with Putin at Helsinki last year secret from his staff and the world, but Russia's president held up the checklist for the cameras.
