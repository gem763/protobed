Apple has released iOS 13, iOS 13.1, and iPadOS 13. (updated for iOS 13.1).

These security flaws can be used to execute arbitrary code with kernel and system privileges, respectively.\n\nTwo macOS kernel-based bugs have also been squashed, both of which also relate to memory corruption. CVE-2019-8717 and CVE-2019-8781, if unpatched, can permit attackers to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.\n\nAn interesting logic vulnerability in IOGraphics, CVE-2019-8755, has also been fixed which permits malicious applications to analyze and potentially determine kernel memory layouts.\n\nAnother code execution flaw detected and resolved is CVE-2019-8745, a buffer overflow traced back to the UIFoundation component which could be triggered through malicious text files.\n\nCNET: Court finds FBI use of NSA database violated Americans' Fourth Amendment rights\n\nIn WebKit, Apple's browser engine, both CVE-2019-8769 and CVE-2019-8768 have been resolved. The first vulnerability was present in how the OS drew webpage elements and could be abused by threat actors in the development of malicious websites designed to reveal a user's browsing history, whereas the second prevented users from deleting items from their browsing history logs at all.\n\nThe tech giant also destroyed a bug in PDFKit, caused by how the software handles links embedded within encrypted PDF files and which could be exploited for the exfiltration of content from the encrypted files. This bug has been assigned CVE-2019-8772.\n\nIn the Notes macOS software, CVE-2019-8730 caused some locked notes to appear in search results, and users with local access could potentially view private content. A memory corruption bug in the sips image processing system -- CVE-2019-8701 -- which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code with system privileges has also been patched.\n\nTechRepublic: Only 1 in 5 enterprises have DMARC records set up with an enforcement policy\n\nTwo issues in PHP functions -- CVE-2019-11041 and CVE-2019-11042 -- a memory corruption flaw in CoreAudio, CVE-2019-8705, and a race condition issue in Crash Reporter, tracked as CVE-2019-8757, have also been resolved. A security flaw in SharedFileList, CVE-2019-8770, is a problem that could allow malicious apps to access recent documents and has now been eradicated.\n\nThe iPad and iPhone maker has also released security fixes for iCloud for Windows 10.7 and 7.14, as well as iTunes 12.10.1 for Windows.\n\nSee also: European police arrest Dark Web counterfeit currency traders\n\nApple has thanked researchers from Google Project Zero, Core Development, Computest, SentinelOne, and Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative, alongside Csaba Fitzl, Pi\u00e9rre Reimertz, and Kent Zoya, among others, for assisting with and reporting the security issues.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
