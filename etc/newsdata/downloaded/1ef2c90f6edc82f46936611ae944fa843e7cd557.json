The team brought in a number of notable players through trades and free agency, then firmly established themselves as a contender with a record $330 million contract for former MVP and division rival Bryce Harper.\n\nIn summary, the Phillies made a number of major moves:\n\n$330 million contract for OF Bryce Harper (3.6 bWAR in 2019 entering Tuesday)\n\n$50 million contract for OF Andrew McCutchen (1.4 bWAR)\n\n$23 million contract for RHP David Robertson (0.0 bWAR)\n\ntrading 1B Carlos Santana (4.9 bWAR) and SS JP Crawford (0.8 bWAR) for SS Jean Segura (1.5 bWAR), RHP Juan Nicasio (0.2 bWAR), LHP James Pazos (never played with team)\n\ntrading top prospects C Jorge Alfaro and RHP Sixto Sanchez for C J.T. Realmuto (4.4 bWAR)\n\nTo be fair to McCutchen and Robertson, those two were hurt for much of the year, with Robertson lasting only a couple weeks before an elbow injury requiring Tommy John surgery and McCutchen tearing his ACL in June.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, that\u2019s not a ton value the Phillies got after spending in the mid-nine figures. Realmuto played as advertised, one of the best catchers in baseball, but it\u2019s hard to call any of the team\u2019s other major acquisitions a win so far, especially Harper.\n\nBryce Harper was good in 2019. That wasn't enough for the Phillies. (AP Photo/Nick Wass)\n\nHarper posted a fine enough season, hitting .257/.373/.499 with 33 home runs, 108 RBIs and much-improved defense from last year, but the Phillies aren\u2019t paying him $27.5 million until 2031 for him to be just fine right now.\n\nThe Phillies paid Harper like he was a perennial MVP candidate and culture-setter for the team, and now the team is eliminated and it\u2019s hard to see the player receiving any MVP votes in his age-27 season. That\u2019s not just a disappointment this year, it\u2019s a worry going forward.\n\nPhillies\u2019 problems were more than Harper\n\nAs easy as it is to place blame for the failures of a team onto its biggest names, injuries were also a major problem for the Phillies this year. Of course, that could be seen as a natural byproduct of signing several aging, but still talented players.\n\nBetween McCutchen, Robertson, Nicasio, Jake Arrieta, Corey Dickerson, Pat Neshek, Tommy Hunter and more, the Phillies have more than $70 million in annual payroll tied up on the injured list right now.\n\nA thin rotation and even thinner bullpen didn\u2019t do the team too many favors either, though you wonder if that will be enough to rationalize keeping the man in charge of the team.\n\nWhat does this mean for Gabe Kapler?\n\nWhen it comes to talent-laden teams disappointing, the script is well-known. The manager is often singled out for blame, and that could very well be the case for Phillies manager Gabe Kapler.\n\nWhen asked about his job status, Kapler didn\u2019t have much to say beyond that he loves his job.\n\nWith the Phillies eliminated, Gabe Kapler was asked if he believes his job status is affected by missing the postseason. His response: pic.twitter.com/BeS2mN1Xlh \u2014 Matt Gelb (@MattGelb) September 24, 2019\n\nUnder Kapler, the Phillies are now 159-159 in two seasons with no postseason appearances. They lasted just one day longer in the playoff race this year compared to last season, bowing out in Sept. 23 during the 2018 season and Sept. 24 in 2019.\n\nPhillies general manager Matt Klentak gave Kapler a vote of confidence in June, but plenty could have changed since then. Even if Kapler makes it to the 2020 season, the hot seat will be scorching.\n\nVenue of Phillies elimination adds insult to injury\n\nAs if the day wasn\u2019t bad enough for Harper and the Phillies, their elimination also had to come in the stadium of the team that did just fine without the high-priced outfielder this season.\n\nThe 88-69 Nationals clinched their trip to October in the second game of the doubleheader, overcoming a slow start in April and May to reach the wild card game. They will likely face the Milwaukee Brewers there, with the home field still to be decided.\n\nHarper was at least able to get his own little revenge in the second game, hitting a pinch-hit home run off nemesis Hunter Strickland.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Phillies were one of MLB's most anticipated teams this season.
