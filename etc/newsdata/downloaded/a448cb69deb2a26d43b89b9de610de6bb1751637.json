REUTERS/Susana Vera\n\nPolice urged the government to impose curfews to help curb the escalating violence in the Chinese-ruled city, where officers have become a target of protesters amid accusations of excessive force.\n\nActivists went on the rampage in districts across the Asian financial hub late into the night, setting fires, blocking roads and vandalising shops and metro stations as police fired tear gas to disperse them.\n\n\u201cWherever there are protests nearby I\u2019ll come ... I\u2019m out tonight for a simple reason. You don\u2019t shoot a teenager at point blank range,\u201d said Alex Chan, an interior designer at a protest in the bustling shopping district of Causeway Bay.\n\n\u201cThese protests will continue and we won\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\nThousands took to the streets on Wednesday to denounce the shooting by police of Tony Tsang, an 18-year-old secondary-school student, which police said was an act of self-defence.\n\nTsang was shot at point-blank range as he fought a police officer with a metal pipe on Tuesday, when demonstrators hurled petrol bombs at police who responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon.\n\nHe has been charged with rioting and assaulting an officer, police said.\n\nRail operator MTR Corp closed stations in districts including Po Lam, Hang Hau and Tseung Kwan O just before midnight on Wednesday as violence escalated once again. All affected stations had reopened on Thursday.\n\nLam Chi-wai, chairman of Junior Police Officers Association, urged the city\u2019s leader to impose a curfew to maintain public order, according to a statement released on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe are only an enforcement agency with limited power under the law. When facing such a series of massive rioting incidents, we cannot work alone - clapping only with one hand - without appropriate measures and support from top level,\u201d Lam said.\n\nThe Hong Kong public has become increasingly hostile towards police amid accusations of heavy-handed tactics. Police say they have shown restraint in the face of increased violence.\n\nThe lawyer for an Indonesian journalist injured when police fired a projectile during protests on Sunday said she will be left blind in one eye.\n\nThe European Union said in a statement it was deeply troubled by the escalation of violence in Hong Kong and the only way forward was through \u201crestraint, de-escalation and dialogue\u201d.\n\nThe former British colony has been rocked by months of protests over a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial, but have evolved into calls for democracy, among other demands.\n\nFILE PHOTO: People attend a march in Causeway Bay in solidarity with the student protester who got shot by police with live ammunition in Hong Kong, China October 2, 2019.
