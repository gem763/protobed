According to the Dallas Morning News, pool report referee Ron Torbert said the penalty was for \u201cabusive language toward an official.\u201d Jones appeared to be befuddled over the response.\n\nPITTSBURGH STEELERS' MASON RUDOLPH BRIEFLY HOSPITALIZED AFTER RECEIVING SCARY BLOW TO HEAD DURING GAME\n\n\u201cOh, I hope the little darling didn't hear something he hadn't heard before,\u201d Jones said, according to ESPN. \u201cWe should all stop the wheel over that if he got [a penalty for] abusive language.\u201d\n\nThe interaction between Garrett and Edwards came in the third quarter after Cowboys wide receiver Amari Cooper was ruled out of bounds on a catch he appeared to have made. Garrett was forced to use a challenge and the call was overturned.\n\nHOUSTON TEXANS' DESHAUN WATSON RECALLS TIP HE RECEIVED AS ATLANTA FALCONS BALL BOY\n\n\u201cWe had already challenged a potential pass interference earlier [and] you know in that situation you have to use the flag to get the call corrected and you're not going to have one for later in the game,\u201d Garrett said after the game. \u201cObviously, I didn't handle that situation as well as I should have. I knew we were going to get the play because I saw it and unfortunately we had to use that flag there. And he made the decision to throw a flag on me.\u201d\n\nGarrett also took issue with a pass interference penalty that was called on Anthony Brown earlier in the quarter, for which he also threw a challenge flag.\n\n\u201cThe standard is very high for them to overturn,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was more of a situational challenge. I don't think it was pass interference. If I thought it was pass interference I wouldn't have thrown the flag, but understanding the standard is high because of the situation, you have to give yourself a chance. ... Oftentimes when you slow it down, things look a little more magnified than they are. I know it's hard to get those things overturned, but it's too big of a play not to do it.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nGreen Bay ended up winning the game 34-24, despite a fierce comeback from Dallas.", "description": "Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones took a shot at a referee after the team\u2019s loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
