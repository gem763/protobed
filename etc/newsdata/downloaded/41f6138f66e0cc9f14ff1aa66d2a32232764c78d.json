UPDATE 6-Oil prices ease but are on track for large weekly gain\n\n* U.S. crude stocks fell unexpectedly last week\n\n* OPEC and allies consider deeper oil cuts\n\n* Weak economic outlook drags on prices\n\n* Graphic on U.S. petroleum inventories: https://tmsnrt.rs/2XkQF8e\n\n\n\n(Updates prices)\n\nBy Ahmad Ghaddar\n\nLONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Oil prices eased on Friday but\n\nwere on track for strong weekly gains as support from a surprise\n\ndraw in U.S. inventories and possible action from OPEC and its\n\nallies to extend output cuts outweighed broader economic\n\nconcerns.\n\nBrent crude was down 29 cents at $61.38 by 1359 GMT\n\nbut the benchmark was set for a weekly gain of over 3%. West\n\nTexas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 22 cents at\n\n$56.01 and on track for a gain of more than 4% over the week.\n\nThe strong weekly performance was underpinned by the\n\nsurprise decline in U.S. inventories, with total U.S. crude and\n\noil product stocks dropping by about 10 million barrels last\n\nweek. EIA/S\n\nProviding further price support, officials at the\n\nOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said\n\nextended supply curbs are an option to offset the weaker demand\n\noutlook in 2020.\n\nSaudi Arabia, OPEC's de facto leader, wants to focus first\n\non boosting adherence to the group's production-reduction pact\n\nwith Russia and other non-members, an alliance known as OPEC+,\n\nbefore committing to more cuts, sources told Reuters.\n\nThe shutdown since Oct. 16 of Britain's 150,000 bpd Buzzard\n\noilfield and a brief shutdown in the North Sea's Forties\n\nPipeline System also lent support. Sources told Reuters that\n\nBuzzard would restart over the weekend. Yet concerns over weakening economic growth continued to\n\ndrag on prices.\n\n\"Slowing global activity will see demand drop, so the\n\nreality is that oil rallies will be limited,\" said Jeffrey\n\nHalley, senior market analyst at OANDA.\n\n\"It won't take much too pull the rug out from under oil's\n\nfeet.\"\n\nEconomists in a Reuters poll said a steeper decline in\n\nglobal economic growth remains more likely than a synchronised\n\nrecovery, even as multiple central banks dole out rounds of\n\nmonetary easing. Reuters poll of economists found the recent truce in\n\nthe U.S.-China trade war is not an economic turning point and\n\nhas done nothing to reduce the risk that the United States could\n\nslip into recession in the next two years. \"The recent slowdown in U.S. data has resurrected talk of\n\nU.S. growth 'catching down' to the rest of the world,\" RBC\n\nCapital Markets said in a note to clients.\n\nThere was also more bad news for European powerhouse\n\nGermany, with a survey showing employment in the nation's\n\nprivate sector fell for the first time in six years in October,\n\nsuggesting that a third-quarter slowdown could stretch into the\n\nclosing months of the year.
