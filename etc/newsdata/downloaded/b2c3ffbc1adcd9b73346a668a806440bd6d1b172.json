Jumia\u2019s trading volume on Thursday moved up 19 percent over the daily average since the company went public.\n\nSites that track SEC Form 4 trades, or sales by insiders, aren\u2019t showing anything (at the moment) for Jumia.\n\nWhat does this all mean? It appears there wasn\u2019t an immediate big stock sell by Jumia\u2019s early and large shareholders post lockup expiry. There was some speculation these investors could drop the company after several rough and tumble months for Jumia post IPO.\n\nFounded in Lagos in 2012, Jumia currently operates multiple online verticals in 14 African countries \u2014 from B2C consumer retail to travel bookings.\n\nFor Jumia, going public has been an up and down affair. After becoming the first tech startup operating in Africa to list on a major exchange, the company saw its share price rise 70% after listing on the NYSE in April at $14.50.\n\nThen in May, Jumia\u2019s stock tumbled when it came under assault from a short-seller, Andrew Left, who accused the company of fraud in its SEC filings.\n\nJumia\u2019s latest earnings reporting \u2014 delivered in August \u2014 had some downside beyond losses. The company did post second-quarter revenue growth of 58% (\u2248$43 million) and increased its customer base to 4.8 million from 3.2 million over the same period a year ago.\n\nBut Jumia also posted greater losses for the period, 67.8 million euros, compared to 42.3 million euros in 2018.\n\nOn top of that, Jumia opened up about a sales related fraud (that it has reported in its original SEC IPO filing) committed by some of its employees and members of its JForce program \u201cto benefit from differences between commissions charged to sellers and higher commissions paid to JForce agents,\u201d according to a Jumia statement.\n\n\u201cThe transactions in question generated approximately 1% of our GMV in each of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 and had virtually no impact on our 2018 or 2019 financial statements,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nCollectively, this has added up to influence Jumia\u2019s share-price falling some 50% from its opening price of $14.50 and 80% from its high of $46.99 on May 1.\n\nAs a public company now, the most direct way for Jumia to revive its share-price would be reducing its losses while maintaining or boosting revenues. Of course, that\u2019s the common prescription for many a tech company.\n\nJumia believes expanding and generating more revenue through its JumiaPay product (with better margins than B2C e-commerce transactions) could help close the revenue vs. loss gap.\n\nInvestors and the market at large will be able to track Jumia\u2019s progress during its next (Q3) earnings call, scheduled for November 12, Jumia confirmed to TechCrunch.", "description": "Shares of Africa focused e-commerce company Jumia dropped 4% the day after the lockup period expired for its April IPO on the New York Stock Exchange.
