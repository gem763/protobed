Lou Yuan's threat isn't an empty one. The Chinese military has deployed an array of weaponry that it acquired specifically to target American flattops.\n\nBut a U.S. Navy test in 2005 proved that even if you hit them, carriers are really hard to sink.\n\nLou made his provocative comment on Dec. 20, 2018 at the Military Industry List summit, according to media reports.\n\n\u201cWhat the United States fears the most is taking casualties,\u201d declared Lou, an anti-American author, social commentator and military theorist at the PLA Academy of Military Science.\n\nSinking just one carrier could kill 5,000 Americans, Lou pointed out. Sink two, and you double the toll. \"We\u2019ll see how frightened America is\" after losing 10,000 sailors, Lou crowed.\n\nLeaving aside the likelihood of a full-scale war breaking out between the world's two leading military powers and economies, sinking a carrier is easier said than done. History underscores the difficulty of the undertaking.\n\nIn 1964 Viet Cong saboteurs managed to damage and briefly sink the former U.S. Navy escort carrier Card while the vessel, then operating as an aircraft ferry for U.S. Military Sealift Command, moored in Saigon.\n\nBut the last time anyone permanently sank a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier in combat was during World War II. Twelve American carriers sank during the war, usually following intensive air attacks. The last to sink, USS Bismarck Sea, fell victim to Japanese kamikazes in February 1945.\n\nIn subsequent decades, American flattops suffered serious accidents including collisions and fires, but none sank. It's very difficult to sink a buoyant, thousand-feet-long ship that's mostly made of steel.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "The story starts in 2005.", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3oWYNmFwH7Uq_2FeXqk_mg--~B/aD05MjE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/0a75fcef451dea5abdbcb64a67e7e28e", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
