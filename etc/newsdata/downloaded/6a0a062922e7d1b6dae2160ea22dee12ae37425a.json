Asked about his son in the debate\u2019s opening minutes, Mr. Biden worked to summon the righteous fury and stern statesman\u2019s gaze perfected over his half-century in public life.\n\n\u201cMy son did nothing wrong,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI did nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nAt times, his delivery was wobbly, as it tends to be. He stopped and started a bit. He cited George Washington. But he worked toward the conclusion he has been repeating often on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want me to be the candidate,\u201d Mr. Biden said of the president. \u201cHe is going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.\u201d\n\nBefore the debate, several rivals had come to Mr. Biden\u2019s defense, plainly mindful of the limits and potential downsides of condemning peers so far this year \u2014 and of condemning Mr. Biden on this subject in particular. None made an issue of Mr. Biden\u2019s family on Tuesday.\n\nAt the previous three debates, Mr. Biden had been the focus of attacks both glancing and sharply personal. Yet the candidates who have gone after Mr. Biden frontally \u2014 including Ms. Harris; Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former federal housing secretary; and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who has left the race \u2014 have seen few lasting benefits. In some cases, such as Mr. Castro\u2019s, the effort appeared to backfire with some Democratic voters and officials who are eager to keep the focus on Mr. Trump.", "description": "Her reward for a steady rise in the polls?
