The central bank has forecast growth of 3% for 2019.\n\nJohn Ashbourne, Senior Emerging Markets Economist at Capital\n\nEconomics in London, said in a note that the GDP figures\n\n\"underlined the weakness of Nigeria's economy\" and suggested\n\nthat growth would remain at around 2% in 2019 and 2020.\n\nIn the second quarter, the non-oil sector grew 1.64% and the\n\noil sector expanded 5.15%, according to the statistics office.\n\nBut crude production in the continent's top oil producing\n\ncountry dipped to 1.98 million barrels per day from 1.99 million\n\nin the previous quarter.\n\n\"The recovery in oil GDP looks promising. However given\n\nsofter oil prices in subsequent quarters, this pace of growth...\n\nmay not be sustained,\" said Razia Khan, chief economist for\n\nAfrica and Middle East at Standard Chartered Bank.\n\n\"Weak growth itself should not have been too much of a\n\nsurprise,\" she added, arguing that \"Q2 represented something of\n\na lost, post-election quarter\".\n\nShe pointed to the uncertainty around the government in the\n\nwake of President Muhammadu Buhari's re-election in February.\n\nBuhari was not inaugurated until May 29 and did not appoint\n\nministers until August. Nigeria's stock market has been beset by lacklustre\n\nperformance this year as investors waited for policy signals in\n\nthe wake of the election.\n\nLocal banks have been trading at historic low book values,\n\nweighed down by weak sentiment over the economy.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, South Africa reported\n\nstronger-than-expected 3.1% growth as mining and manufacturing\n\nrecovered. Nigeria and South Africa - the continent's two largest\n\neconomies - have a major impact on regional growth. The two,\n\nwhen combined with Angola, make up about 60 percent of\n\nsub-Saharan Africa's annual economic output.\n\nIn April, the World Bank cut its growth forecast for\n\nsub-Saharan African growth to 2.8 percent, from an initial 3.3\n\npercent, in part due to slower growth in Nigeria and Angola, due\n\nto challenges in the oil sector, and subdued investment growth\n\nin South Africa.\n\n\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 3-Nigeria's economic growth slows for second quarter", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/forex_4_800x533_L_1413209320.jpg"}
