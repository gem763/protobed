I love the blatant double standards.'\n\nAbbie was referencing an incident in which contestant Ryan Anderson took Bachelorette Angie Kent aside to talk privately.\n\nThe blonde said she was vilified for doing the same with Matt Agnew in her season of The Bachelor.\n\nChats: Abbie was referencing an incident in which contestant Ryan Anderson (left) took Bachelorette Angie Kent (right) aside to talk privately\n\nDid it too! The blonde said she was vilified for doing the same with Matt Agnew (right) in her season of The Bachelor\n\nIt's not the first time the beauty has called out what she sees as inequality betweem the shows.\n\nOn a recent episode of The Bachelorette, Ciarran Stott was praised as 'confident' when he stripped off for a 'nude modelling' group date.\n\nBut runner-up Abbie believes a double standard is at play considering she was recently 'sl*t shamed' for posing in a bikini.\n\nAbbie reportedly wrote: 'Interesting that when I merely took Matt away for a chat and said, 'I'm not here to make friends' not even after a single date and not in private, I was a abused online and called a psycho/b**ch/immature/breaking girl code'\n\nShe went on: 'But when Ryan takes Angie away he's a gentleman who is only there for Angie and is more mature than everyone else? I love the blatant double standards'\n\nOn Saturday, Abbie decided 'to do a Ciarran' and posed nude on Instagram to prove a point.\n\nAbbie captioned the provocative snap with a lengthy, self-described 'feminist rant'.\n\nIt begun: 'Last week on The Bachelorette, fan favourite Ciarran stripped down to nothing as part of a group date.

On Thursday night's episode of The Bachelorette, Ciarran Stott (pictured) was praised as 'confident' when he stripped off for a 'nude modelling' group date\n\n'This caused Australia (including me) to fall even further in love with him, admiring his confidence, sense of humour and cheeky behaviour. The fact that he was so open about usually taboo topics was amazing.'\n\nAbbie continued: 'While I love that the majority of the public got behind Ciarran, I couldn't help but wonder what it would be like if the gender roles had been reversed.\n\n'What if I had been on a group date, offered to strip down to nothing and posed nude on National TV? What if in the same week I had shared that I had plastic surgery and had danced in night clubs?' said Abbie.", "description": "Abbie Chatfield has lashed out over what she sees as a double standard on The Bachelorette.", "authors": ["Marta Jary For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/09/20171732-0-image-a-11_1571993429541.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
