His first was delivered, and then retracted, during a memorable episode in November 2017 when he was more-or-less kidnapped by the Saudi Arabian monarchy and forced out of office.\n\nThis time, Hariri resigned to thunderous cheers on the streets of Lebanon, so it looks like he is gone for good.\n\nProtesters have filled the streets for the past two weeks, demanding Hariri\u2019s ouster in a season of discontent that began with a deeply unpopular tax hike proposal and developed into a revolt against the entire Lebanese system of government.\n\nThe surprisingly upbeat protesters have come to describe their movement as a thawra, or revolution, much like the protest movement in Iraq, except with much more beer, dancing, lullabies for children trying to sleep, hugging, and colorful profanity. It might be the first attempt in history to completely overthrow a government with a block party.\n\nThe Lebanese even appropriated the deathless 90s pop hit \u201cBaby Got Back\u201d and adjusted one of the lyrics to say, \u201cYou ain\u2019t got none unless you got funds, hun,\u201d replacing the original song\u2019s celebration of ample female posteriors with a mocking reference to the financial problems of the Lebanese government. Every revolution dreams of a knight on horseback riding in to save the day, but it usually isn\u2019t Sir Mix-a-Lot.\n\nLike every party, the Lebanese protest had some unwelcome guests. One of its major complaints concerns the influence of the Iran-backed Shiite terrorist group Hezbollah. Ironically, the Saudis had the same complaint when they checked Hariri into his extended stay in Riyadh and helped him write a letter of resignation in 2017.\n\nHezbollah did not take kindly to this criticism and dispatched gangs of black-clad thugs to beat protesters and set their camps on fire. Some of the attacks reportedly involved knives and guns. Witnesses claimed Lebanese security forces did not act to protect them from the attackers, who made their identity clear by chanting \u201cShia!\u201d and singing songs that praised Hezbollah and the Shiite political party Amal.\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah warned before Hariri\u2019s resignation that overthrowing the government could lead to \u201cchaos,\u201d \u201ccollapse,\u201d and \u201ccivil war.\u201d He said the protest movement began with legitimate complaints about corruption but became a puppet of Israel and the West, which he accused of seeking to destabilize Lebanon for their own gains.\n\nThe protesters have a broad spectrum of complaints, coupled with the conviction that the usual Lebanese power-sharing deals and tepid gestures at reform will not lead to satisfactory improvements, especially not with Lebanon teetering on the brink of financial collapse.\n\n\u201cThe only real way forward for Lebanon is to appoint a government that can move on from the disruption of this revolution and restore the confidence with the people and the international community,\u201d Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh said on Monday, predicting there are literally only days to act before a fiscal meltdown becomes inevitable.\n\n\u201cI tried to find a way to listen to the people\u2019s demands and to protect the country from security, economic and living risks. Today, I have reached a dead end and we need a positive shock to end the crisis,\u201d Hariri said during his farewell speech on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cPositions come and go, but the dignity and safety of the country remains,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one is more important than their country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t hide this from you. I have reached a dead-end,\u201d Hariri admitted. \u201cTo all my political peers, our responsibility today is how to protect Lebanon and to uplift the economy. Today, there is a serious opportunity and we should not waste it.\u201d\n\nProtesters quickly let it be known they have no intention of halting their activities because Hariri is gone and he took most of the Lebanese government with him. For that matter, they observed Hariri is still the \u201ccaretaker\u201d PM until the parliament votes for a new leader, and there is nothing stopping them from nominating and re-electing Hariri.\n\nThe most popular slogan of the protests is \u201cAll of Them Means All of Them,\u201d which is meant as a demand for all of Lebanon\u2019s party leaders to resign. Most observers find that outcome unlikely and suspect a new government will be formed by many of the same players but with more promises of reform and a few more token independent representatives.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want any part of the ruling class to be part of this government. The most important thing is to get rid of them all, and form a new electoral law that abolishes sectarianism and has Lebanon as one district,\u201d one protester explained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good first step but we\u2019re still going to stay in the streets. Hariri is part of the problem but he\u2019s not all of the problem,\u201d said another. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone thinks we\u2019re done.\u201d", "description": "Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigns, giving protesters a major victory, although they said they aren't finished yet.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/11/Saad-al-Hariri-.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
