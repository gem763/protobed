Tyson Barrie, acquired from the Colorado Avalanche in the off-season trade for Nazem Kadri, added two assists.\n\nWATCH | Leafs defeat Senators in season opener:\n\nMitch Marner set up Auston Matthews for a gorgeous goal in Toronto's 5-3 win over Ottawa. 1:57\n\nMatthews now has nine goals and two assists in the four season-opening games of his young career \u2014 including the four he bagged against the Senators in his debut back in 2016. The 22-year-old is also just the fourth player in NHL history to score in each of his first four career openers.\n\n\"I try to score every game,\" Matthews said in trying to downplay the accomplishment.\n\nBrady Tkachuk, Scott Sabourin and Bobby Ryan replied for Ottawa. Craig Andersen made 37 saves.\n\n\"The guys worked hard for the most part,\" said Senators head coach D.J. Smith, an ex-Leafs assistant making his debut as an NHL bench boss. \"Some people had a little bit of a tough night. In saying that, guys fought right to the buzzer.\"\n\nA native of nearby Oakville, Ont., Tavares fills a captaincy that had been vacant since Dion Phaneuf was traded to the Senators in February 2016. The 29-year-old centre signed with the Leafs in unrestricted free agency on July 1, 2018, and has been everything Toronto could ask for \u2014 and possibly more \u2014 in his 15 months with the team.\n\nWATCH | Where do Leafs, Sens stand among Canadian NHL teams?\n\nRob Pizzo looks at which teams have the best chance to win Canada's first Stanley Cup since 1993. 3:43\n\nTavares put up a career-high 47 goals and 88 points in his first season with the Leafs, and was a calming influence both on and off the ice as a young team with boatloads of skill looks to navigate the tricky NHL waters.\n\n\"Johnny's the perfect guy for the job,\" Rielly said. \"A poised, confident person who carries himself like a true professional.\"\n\nDown 1-0 after the opening period, Gauthier scored Toronto's first goal of the season 2:20 into the second when he beat out former Leafs defenceman Nikita Zaitsev to a loose puck.\n\nMoore made it 2-1 for the home side at 4:42 when he poked a shot home in front of Anderson off a feed from Mikheyev.\n\nBut Sabourin \u2014 like Mikheyev also playing his first NHL game \u2014 finished off a pretty passing play just 1:09 later to tie it up.\n\nOttawa looked to have retaken the lead at 7:28, but Ron Hainsey \u2014 another ex-Leafs blue-liner \u2014 had his goal called back after an offside challenge.\n\nWATCH | 9 things you need to know about the upcoming NHL season...in 90 seconds:\n\nNeed a refresher before the NHL season kicks off? Rob Pizzo has you covered. 1:50\n\nMatthews promptly went to work just 34 seconds later, taking a slick feed from William Nylander on a 2-on-1 and beating Anderson.\n\nTkachuk was then whistled for goalie interference with just over five minutes left in the period, and Matthews made Ottawa pay by burying a one-timer over Anderson's shoulder off a great no-look Marner feed.\n\nThe crowd at Scotiabank Arena followed that laser by chanting Matthews' name the following shift. The top pick in the 2016 NHL draft has had a rough stretch after news broke last week that he's facing a charge of disorderly conduct and disruptive behaviour stemming from an alleged incident \u2014 which he failed to disclose to the team \u2014 in his hometown of Scottsdale, Ariz., back in May.\n\nMikheyev put the game out of reach at 9:43 of the third when he got enough of a pass from Barrie to beat Anderson upstairs for his first in the NHL.\n\nRyan got a consolation goal for Ottawa with 2:15 left in regulation, beating Andersen through the pads from the slot.\n\nMatthews came close to getting his second-career hat trick late into an empty net, but couldn't quite find the range in close before getting checked to the ice.", "description": "Auston Matthews continued his dominance on opening night.
