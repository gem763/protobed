Kyrsten Sinema censured by fellow Arizona Dems: report", "language": "en", "text": "U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema may face a censure vote by Arizona\u2019s Democratic Party because she votes too often in favor of President Trump\u2019s agenda, according to a report.\n\nSince joining the Senate in January, Sinema has opposed Trump 81 percent of the time, The Arizona Republic reported, citing data from the FiveThirtyEight Trump Tracker.\n\nThat\u2019s apparently not often enough to satisfy many of her fellow Democrats in the Grand Canyon State.\n\nTRUMP ENDORSES MCSALLY IN ARIZONA SENATE RACE, TILLIS IN NORTH CAROLINA\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing: We really support Kyrsten Sinema, we want her to succeed, we want her to be the best senator in the country,\u201d Dan O\u2019Neal, state coordinator for Progressive Democrats of America, told the Republic. \u201cBut the way she is voting is really disappointing. We want Democrats to vote like Democrats and not Republicans.\u201d\n\nSinema\u2019s moderate voting record has helped her win some GOP backing in the state, according to the newspaper, but several votes in particular have riled progressive Democrats.\n\nThose votes include Sinema\u2019s support for David Bernhardt, Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of the Interior, and for William Barr, the U.S. attorney general.\n\nSinema also opted not to back \u201cnet neutrality\u201d rules favored by other Democrats, the newspaper reported\n\nIn July, she was one of several Democrats who called for the implementation of a pilot program that would work to quickly identify and deport migrants at the border who are judged not to have a valid asylum claim.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn April she came out firmly against launching impeachment hearings against President Trump in the wake of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia report.\n\nSinema, 43, a native of Tucson, previously served in the U.S. House, where she backed President Trump even more often, according to the Republic.", "description": "U.S. Sen.
