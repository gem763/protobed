He rapidly details his record as a three-term city councilman: falling crime and unemployment rates in his district, coupled with increased graduation rates and high-school STEM achievement. He juxtaposes this record with the way that Ocasio-Cortez has spent her first year in office.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018o\u2019 in Ocasio stands for \u2018zero,\u2019\u201d he says impatiently. \u201cShe has brought home zero money, she\u2019s advanced zero bills.\u201d His frustration is obvious. Cabrera explains that he had no intention of running for the congressional seat. \u201cI would\u2019ve retired,\u201d he says, but then he saw how Ocasio-Cortez derailed Amazon\u2019s plan to bring its headquarters, and 25,000 jobs, to Queens.\n\nCiting her concern for the city\u2019s working class, Ocasio-Cortez joined fellow progressives in Albany to lobby against the tax breaks that the city used to woo the corporate giant. And, having successfully blocked the move, she bizarrely touted the money she helped the city \u201csave\u201d by blocking tax breaks on taxes that will no longer be paid at all.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jack Crowe", "Nationalreview.Com Fernando-Cabrera-Social-Conservative-Democrat-Challenges-Alexandria-Ocasio-Cortez"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
