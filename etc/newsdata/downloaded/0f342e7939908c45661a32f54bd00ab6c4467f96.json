As I rounded up my little ones, I spotted an acquaintance. Antoinette is almost 95 years old and now wheelchair bound, but her incandescent smile inevitably draws people towards her. \u201cHave you had a nice evening?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d she replied, \u201cI spoke for a long time with Father.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d I said in a hushed tone, \u201cI think he is a mystic.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Antoinette said, taking a deep breath, \u201che saw right to my soul.\u201d\n\n\n\nA mystic is not some sort of Catholic tarot card reader. A mystic is, in the eyes of traditional Christianity, someone God has given certain gifts and graces to accomplish a specific purpose for the salvation of souls. Some of the Church\u2019s notable mystics include great saints like St. Padre Pio, St. John of the Cross, St. Teresa of Avila and St. Catherine of Siena. Their extraordinary ability to sense God transformed their hearts. Theirs were hearts moved to quiet and solitude when necessary, but also to action and service to souls and the Church. They were obedient to God and Church, and \u2013 not unrelatedly \u2013 they were profoundly humble.\n\n\n\nNow, we shouldn\u2019t think that the exceptional relationship that mystics had with God is just for an elite, holy few. No, not at all. Mystics walk among us in our everyday lives \u2013 Antoinette\u2019s and my parish priest, for example \u2013 and a mystical relationship with God is open to us all. In fact, God longs to connect with each one of our hearts and transform them for His glory. To that end, National Review\u2019s Kathryn Jean Lopez has just compiled a beautiful daily devotional, A Year with the Mystics: Visionary Wisdom for Daily Living, that can help open our hearts to such prayerful, mystical encounters with God. Lopez\u2019 message is simple: \u201cYou too can be a mystic.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t pretend to either be a mystic or an expert on mysticism,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut I do pray enough to know that so very few us of us have plumbed the depths of what God wants to reveal to us and do in us through prayer.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Year with the Mystics features brief, daily meditations grounded in the writings and prayers of the Catholic Church\u2019s well-known mystics \u2013 Padre Pio, Teresa of Avila, and John of the Cross, for example. Lopez also includes the words of \u201cactive saints in the world,\u201d figures not conventionally thought of as mystics such as Mother Teresa and Mother Angelica.\n\n\n\nThe book is not a formulaic, chapter-by-chapter guide to the interior life. Rather, each day\u2019s reflection invites the reader into a particular contemplation. \u201cEntering into the light,\u201d \u201cDivine friendship,\u201d \u201cLooking in the mirror, seeing light and virtue,\u201d \u201cPray without ceasing? A how-to\u201d are some of my most favorite daily invitations. Lopez follows up with a brief introduction to an inspired writing, the excerpt itself, a consideration and then a final prayer. The reading and daily meditation takes a brief 15 minutes, but it can inspire an entire holy hour or direct your entire day. It\u2019s worth pointing out that the book is beautifully bound and sturdy enough to survive transport in a purse, briefcase, or the door pocket of the car so that not one day of contemplation is missed.\n\n\n\nI have turned to this little volume often in my prayers since receiving my review copy. And I have found great consolation \u2013 the kind of consolation I saw on Antoinette\u2019s smiling face after she spoke with Father John at the parish festival.\n\n\n\nFor most of us, the mystical union with God will be found as contemplatives in an often loud and busy world. Inviting the mystics to accompany us along our journey of contemplation presents an opportunity for incredible growth in our prayerful encounter with God. In A Year with the Mystics, Kathryn Jean Lopez has mapped a lovely and useful path to facilitate this encounter. \u201cBe not afraid as you\u2019ve heard and will read,\u201d she writes \u201cLet him bring you to a peace that surpasses all understanding, even as he brings you into a deeper understanding in the heart of the Trinity.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/St_Teresa_of_Avila_Credit_Bill_Perry_Shutterstock_CNA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
