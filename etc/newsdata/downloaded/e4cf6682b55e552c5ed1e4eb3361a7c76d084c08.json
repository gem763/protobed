'Toto from \"The Wizard of Oz\" will be confirmed to run DHS before Cucinelli.'\n\nDonald Trump has been told he can't name Ken Cuccinelli to be the acting head of the Department of Homeland Security, but the White House is considering a workaround\n\nKen Cuccinelli, who leads U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, could be the beneficiary of a technical maneuver to be put in the top job at DHS\n\nThe Vacancies Act, dating to 1998, got a custom loophole two years ago when the law controlling U.S. defense budgets was reauthorized. In 2017 Congress gave DHS's secretary the power to change its order of succession, which had been limited to just the three top jobs \u2013 the ones whose occupants the Senate must confirm.\n\nAll three of those posts have been vacant since April, when Trump forced out then-secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and other officials who he saw as too soft on immigration.\n\nActing DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan was set to leave his job at the end of Thursday, but he said at the close of a congressional hearing on Wednesday that he will stay on until his replacement is named and takes over.\n\n'I hope a plan for the successor is imminent, but if necessary I will absolutely ensure a smooth transition,' he said.\n\nUnder a plan being considered in the West Wing, according to The Wall Street Journal, before McAleenan leaves he would rewrite the line of succession to include the assistant secretary who runs the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, making it the no. 4 job.\n\nActing DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan submitted his resignation last month but is staying on until at least the end of Thursday; the plan would require him to elevate an obscure job to the no. 4 position in the department, make it part of the line of succession, and then fire the man who holds it\n\nMcAleenan was the temporary replacement for Kirstjen Nielsen, who Trump forced out of the DHS secretary post in April\n\nThat post, an obscure one far down the departmental depth chart, is currently held by Gary Rasicot, a former Coast Guard deputy commandant who has it on an 'acting' basis.\n\nThrowing Rasicot overboard, which Trump can do without cause, would allow Cuccinelli to step in \u2013 and make him eligible to run all of DHS once McAleenan declares a new pecking order.\n\nIt would also allow the president to avoid a vicious confirmation battle.\n\nTrump's White House personnel director has already told him he can't legally name Cucinelli or his other top pick, Customs and Border Protection head Mark Morgan, to lead Homeland Security through more traditional tactics.\n\nFederal regulations that govern the Vacancies Act state that acting officials in those positions must either be next in line for the job or hold a Senate-confirmed position somewhere else. Neither man qualifies.\n\nTrump could also appoint Cuccinelli or Morgan if either had been leading a department for at least 90 days before the last Senate-confirmed DHS secretary \u2013 in this case Nielsen \u2013 departed. But they were both hired after her tenure ended.\n\nWhite House Director of Presidential Personnel Sean Doocey recently gave Trump a list of other officials to consider for the gig, including senior DHS staffer Chad Wolf and Transportation Security Administration chief David Pekoske, Politico reported.\n\nMcAleenan was Nielsen's 'acting' replacement\n\nHe was the fourth person to hold the top job. Before becoming acting secretary, McAleenan served as commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a position that was confirmed by the Senate.", "description": "The plan would see the acting DHS chief elevate an obscure job to the agency's no. 4 slot, make it part of the line of succession, fire the man who holds it, and give Cuccinelli the job.", "authors": ["David Martosko", "U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/17/20388370-0-image-a-4_1572456328483.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
