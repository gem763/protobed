His resignation date is the same as the U.K.'s current date of departure from the EU, but Brexit could be delayed until January 2020 under legislation passed by MPs last week.\n\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Bercow told MPs it had been \"the greatest privilege and honor of my professional life\" to perform the role of Commons speaker. He joked that in defending the rights of MPs to have a say on Brexit he had been \"the backbencher's backstop.\"\n\nBercow said that he was honoring a pledge to his wife at the 2017 election that it would be his last. An early election is being sought by the government and is regarded as likely in the near future. The Conservative party had said that it would break with convention and stand a candidate against the apolitical speaker, in protest at his role in the Brexit process.\n\nBercow said his departure date would fall \"shortly after\" votes on the Queen's Speech expected on October 21 and 22. \"The week or so after that may be quite lively and it may be best to have an experienced figure in the chair for that short period,\" he told MPs, to cheers from opposition benches.", "description": "Bercow said he was honoring a commitment to his wife not to stand at another general election.", "authors": ["Charlie Cooper", "Cristina Gallardo", "Emilio Casalicchio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1146117663-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
