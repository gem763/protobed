Lucas parked and the other two entered the Junior Food Store.\n\nCromartie shot Slysz twice in the head, the summary says. Unable to open the cash register, Cromartie and Clark fled after Cromartie grabbed two 12-packs of beer.\n\nClark and getaway driver, Thad Lucas, both testified for the state, avoiding the death penalty and murder charges. They have been free from prison since the early 2000s, AJC reports.\n\nIn both cases, Cromartie told others he had shot the clerks, the summary says.\n\nLucas and Clark testified against Cromartie at the September 1997 trial that ended with his death sentence. Lucas and Clark each pleaded guilty to lesser charges, served prison time and were released.\n\nClark has been wanted for an alleged parole violation in 2015, AJC said.", "description": "Georgia Supreme Court temporarily halts Wednesday execution of Ray Jefferson Cromartie, 52.
