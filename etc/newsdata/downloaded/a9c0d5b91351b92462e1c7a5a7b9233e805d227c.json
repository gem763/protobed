(Vincent Thian/AP)\n\nHong Kong protesters on Saturday marked the fifth anniversary of the 2014 Umbrella Revolution that awakened the city\u2019s distinct identity in opposition to its masters in Beijing and laid the groundwork for a political crisis now in its 17th week.\n\nThe Umbrella Movement five years ago was triggered by a proposal from Beijing that would grant Hong Kong only limited democracy rather than full ability to choose the city\u2019s leader. But it turned into a 79-day sit-in when police fired tear gas at the crowd.\n\nFive years later, thousands of protesters descended upon a city park nestled between government buildings, armed with stacks of posters, stickers, fliers and cans of glue and spray paint. They rebuilt so-called \u201cLennon Walls\u201d of anti-government graffiti, plastering them with the images that have shocked this city over the past weeks: police pummeling black-clad protesters, spraying commuters in the eyes with pepper spray and injured demonstrators clutching on to their wounds.\n\n[Hong Kong\u2019s embattled leader faces barrage of criticism at \u2018dialogue\u2019 session]\n\nBut protesters were also gathered with a message: covering every blank surface \u2014 walls, sidewalks and street signs \u2014 with posters encouraging mass action on Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Protesters see the anniversary as a climax for their movement, which, both in 2014 and today, centers on the fears that China under its leader Xi Jinping will erase the city\u2019s cherished freedoms and autonomy.\n\n\u201cWithout the experience five years ago, we could not develop such a belief\u201d in importance of our freedoms, said 18-year old Kai Lo, gluing signs down in a city park. \u201cThe experience made us stronger.\u201d\n\nProtesters assembled the \u201cLennon Wall\u201d of posters and graffiti to stretch from Victoria Park to Tamar Park, both significant landmarks for recent protests with historic turnouts. The rally Saturday evening was organized by the Civil Human Rights Front, the group that planned the first march against a now-scrapped bill that would allow extraditions to mainland China.\n\nAs the protest movement has grown in scope and focus, CHRF has facilitated several huge demonstrations denouncing police brutality and calling for universal suffrage for the semiautonomous territory.\n\nJust 15 minutes after the rally began, protesters began to occupy Harcourt Road, the major thoroughfare they took over during the Umbrella Revolution and occupied several times more over the past months of protest.\n\n\n\nA person steps on posters depicting late Chinese Chairman Mao Zedong, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and Chinese President Xi Jinping at Wan Chai district in Hong Kong, China Sept. 28, 2019. (Jorge Silva/Reuters)\n\nProtesters arriving at the rally \u2014 which included children and the elderly \u2014 had to walk over grinning portraits of Xi, the Chinese president, which had been taped to the ground. Some took extra effort to stomp over the pictures and scrape their shoes over his face. Speakers blasted a rotation of protest song that have provided an ever evolving soundtrack of resistance. Attendees sang along to \u201cGlory to Hong Kong\u201d a recently written unofficial national anthem and a version of pop-singer Sia\u2019s \u201cChandelier,\u201d the lyrics reworked to admonish the police.\n\nWhile police fired just 87 canisters of tear gas in 2014, more than 3,000 rounds along with hundreds of rubber bullets and sponge grenades have been used against the demonstrations over the past four months.\n\nThe use of the noxious gas has become so prevalent that protesters have become adept at quickly extinguishing the spewing canisters \u2014 covering them with pot lids or dousing them with water. Police have also deployed specialized trucks that blast demonstrators with high pressure hoses, the water mixed with chemical irritant and blue dye.\n\nOne of protesters\u2019 key demands is for Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to open a fully independent investigation into the police, but she has resisted, arguing that an existing mechanism is sufficient for the task. More people in Hong Kong are increasingly seeing the police as an illegitimate occupying force carrying out Beijing\u2019s repression.\n\n[Unidentified flinching object: In Hong Kong protests, police wage assault on facts]\n\nProtests in recent months have reinvigorated Hong Kong\u2019s civil society, which was crushed and lost at the end of the Umbrella Movement. Jack Hui, a 27-year old administrator at a financial institution, said he felt \u201chopeless\u201d at the end of the 79-day sit-in because it seemed impossible to keep \u201cpushing forward the democratic revolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine our movement now would last for so long, for more than three months,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just seeing the beginning of the emergence of the movement.\u201d\n\nActivists are also making a bid to join Hong Kong\u2019s legislature in elections slated for November. Joshua Wong, who rose to prominence as a leader of the 2014 protests, announced he would run in next month's local elections for the position of district councilor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced that democracy will grow from the ground from our community,\u201d Wong, 22, said at a campaign launch event on Saturday morning where he appealed for a high voter turnout and said the elections were a way to continue pressure on the Hong Kong government and Beijing. \u201cThe battle ahead is a battle for our home and our homeland,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nAn older man shakes hands with a younger one after a discussion next to a new \u201cLennon Wall\u201d by the government offices in the Admiralty area in Hong Kong on Sept. 28, 2019, as activists mark the fifth anniversary of the \u201cUmbrella Movement,\u201d a failed 79-day occupation that called for universal suffrage.
