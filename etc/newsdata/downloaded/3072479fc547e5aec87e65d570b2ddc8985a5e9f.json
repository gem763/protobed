In Parasite, he annihilates the concept of the nuclear family by setting a brood of lower-class con artists against an upper-class family unit. The slum-dwelling Ki-taek family run scams from their filthy, bug-infested hovel. They pose as servants to the wealthy corporate executive Park family \u2014 the son as a tutor, the daughter as an art therapist, the father as a chauffeur, and the mother as housekeeper \u2014 and then exploit their employers\u2019 trust.\n\nThe Ki-taeks scheme to steal the Parks\u2019 envied luxe \u2014 an insensitive joke that admits impolite class resentment. The film\u2019s hidden subject follows the economic-inequality rants by leftists. Bong extends that enmity into a murderous, bloody, mean-to-be-hilarious climax, then maudlin finale.\n\nBong himself is a political con artist. He pits a family of grifters in opposition to elites, as though clarifying the easily exploited social conflicts frequently repeated in the media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParasite \u2014 it\u2019s the year\u2019s most cynical movie title \u2014 kowtows to those privileged progressives who believe the old Communist adage \u201cProperty is theft.\u201d Bong exaggerates this for Millennials by inviting them to enjoy class antagonism through the comedy of the Ki-taeks defrauding the Parks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouth Korean Bong differs from China\u2019s Chow, a people\u2019s artist whose films are extremely popular. Bong wants his politics both ways: targeting and humiliating the wealthy, high-living entrepreneurs while sentimentalizing and sympathizing with the dishonest, corrupt agitators who angle to swindle them. It\u2019s Antifa comedy \u2014 Bong dismantles the idea of family and social unity (symbolized by despoiling a lavish Architectural Digest\u2013style abode) from his own privileged perspective that flatters the self-righteous destructors, sucking up to the armchair radicals in his audience. If you want to know how leftist politics infect the cultural stream as \u201csick fun,\u201d this is it.\n\nWhile Chow is a filmmaker of great visual wit and an endearing common touch (proven in such films as Shaoliln Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle, The Mermaid, and The New King of Comedy), Bong insidiously uses genre tropes to facile, cynical effect \u2014 praised by trendy critics yet never crossing over into real cultural impact. His ecology-themed monster movie The Host, his dystopian action film Snowpiercer, and his global trade farce Okji deservedly \u2014 ideologically \u2014 flopped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt felt bizarre to hear the media gaggle, assembled at Parasite\u2019s press screening, chuckle and giggle as the devious Ki-taek family put their nefarious scheme over on the gullible Parks, laughing as if watching a topsy-turvy version of My Man Godfrey. Seeing one\u2019s enemies attacked and vilified is not just how contemporary media liberals operate; it\u2019s also a feature of the political bias that defines the festival circuit, where progressive ideology is disguised as approved cultural trends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParasite won the Palm d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival, which has become a yearly celebration of films that proclaim progressive, anti-American attitudes. Those politics have overrun and confused traditional respect for cinema humanism, much as the Nobel prizes have done. In 2018, the Cannes Palm d\u2019Or went to Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda\u2019s Shoplifters, a solemn family-disintegration melodrama. But Parasite is sarcastic; Bong copies the same pitiless, poisonous view of human relations as that in Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s The Killing of a Sacred Deer and The Favourite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy doubling social decay with family dysfunction, Bong and Lanthimos lead a decadent rearguard, confirming Millennial nihilism. It must be a global pandemic, because the ugly sarcasm in these international co-productions matches the pessimism of such American features as Jordan Peele\u2019s Get Out and Us. All these movies welcome apocalypse, and that\u2019s supposed to be clever. \u201cIt\u2019s metaphoric!\u201d is the Ki-taek son\u2019s pet phrase.\n\nThe inhumane antagonisms and sociopathic behavior in Parasite bungle class relations just like Get Out and Us but minus racial paranoia as justification \u2014 although the tirade of the ousted housekeeper, imitating North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-il, might convey secret ethnic-power urges and envy for South Korean audiences (it\u2019s the film\u2019s cancel-culture twist).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBong, Lanthimos, and Peele are a long way from classic sociological satire. Their films reveal the millennium\u2019s moral defects, flirting with horror and using videogame-slasher-movie snark, but never rising to truly challenging complexity \u2014 unlike Chow\u2019s pop epics or Teorema (1969), Pier Paolo Pasolini\u2019s art movie about the modern deconstructed family. Teorema was a deliberately schematic analysis of both family and religious structures and of capitalist hierarchy and Communist folly. It was also a bold self-examination by Pasolini, whose scheme tested his own fleshly urges, spiritual regrets, and intellectual theories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMillennial social satirists don\u2019t dare personal revelation. Bong repeats the same self-pleasing psychosis as in Call Me By Your Name when the grifter Ki-taek father advises his son: \u201cLive with no plan. Whether it\u2019s killing someone or betraying your country, nothing matters.\u201d Parasite\u2019s award-winning nihilism proves why Chow is a filmmaker for the ages and Bong is a charlatan for the moment.", "description": "Director Bong Joon-ho annihilates the concept of the nuclear family by setting a brood of lower-class con artists against an upper-class family unit.", "authors": ["Armond White", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Kevin D.
