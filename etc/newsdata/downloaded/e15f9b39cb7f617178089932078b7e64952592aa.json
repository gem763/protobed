We have over 180,000 people under evacuation right now. Some of the evacuations that we added yesterday afternoon and through the night included the areas around Sebastopol and West County.\"Even with more than 30-thousand firefighting personnel pitted against the fire, only 11 percent of the inferno has been brought under control.The National Weather Service says gusts topped 129 kilometers an hour as of early Sunday. And those strong winds are forecast through Sunday night.Authorities are now concerned that the wind will push fires closer to other heavily-populated areas.Sonoma County has been ravaged by the Kincade Fire since last Wednesday.It has turned 12-thousand hectares of land into ash and destroyed almost 80 buildings and structures.There's still no official word on how the fire started.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
