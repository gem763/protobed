The lawmakers set a Friday deadline.\n\nTrump has said Perry teed up the July 25 call, in which Trump pressed Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son, who was employed by a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nPerry did not answer questions about his decision upon arrival in Fort Worth.\n\nA spokeswoman for Perry could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.\n\nThe spokeswoman, Shaylyn Hynes, has said Perry wanted Trump to speak with the Ukrainian leader on energy matters related to U.S. efforts to boost Western energy ties to Eastern Europe. It is part of a long-term effort to lessen the political control Russia wields through its dominance of the fuel supply.\n\nThe Associated Press reported this month that a circle of businessmen and Republican donors touted their connections to Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as they sought to install new management at the top of Ukraine\u2019s state-owned gas company last spring.\n\nThe plan hit a snag after Zelinskiy\u2019s election, but Perry took up the effort to install a friendlier management team at the company, Naftogaz. Perry, a former Texas governor and Republican presidential candidate, attended Zelinskiy\u2019s May 2019 inauguration as the administration\u2019s senior representative and met privately with Zelinskiy. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nPerry had disputed reports that he was planning to leave the administration in an interview Wednesday with The Wall Street Journal. But he reportedly left the door open, saying he expected to be at the Energy Department at Thanksgiving, but giving a less definitive answer when asked whether he\u2019d be there through the end of the year.\n\nResponding to earlier reports of his imminent departure, Perry told a news conference in Lithuania earlier this month, \u201cOne of these days they will probably get it right. But it\u2019s not today, it\u2019s not tomorrow, not next month. Keep saying it and one day you\u2019ll be right.\u201d\n\nPerry, who became energy secretary in 2017, has supported Trump\u2019s call for \u201cenergy dominance\u201d around the world and pushed to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants. He said last year that a rash of coal and nuclear retirements was \u201calarming\u201d and posed a looming crisis for the nation\u2019s power grid.\n\n\u201cIf unchecked, (the plant closures) will threaten our ability to recover from intentional attacks and natural disasters,\u201d Perry said at a speech in Texas.\n\nTrump, who has frequently promised to bring back coal jobs, directed Perry in June 2018 to take \u201cimmediate steps\u201d to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open, calling it a matter of national and economic security.\n\nNo definitive action has been taken since then, and experts said Trump was attempting to solve a problem that doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nA regional transmission organization that oversees the power grid in 13 Eastern and Midwestern states said there\u2019s no immediate threat to system reliability.", "description": "Energy Secretary Rick Perry has notified the president that he intends to leave his job soon.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT554_rickpe_ZG_20191017165327.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
