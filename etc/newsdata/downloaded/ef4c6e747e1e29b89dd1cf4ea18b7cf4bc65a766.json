Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is putting America's security at risk by interviewing State Department officials in secret, and should be \"embarrassed\" by the \"kangaroo court\" he's overseeing, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday.\n\n\"We've got officers going up there to testify about important security-related matters, without a State Department lawyer in the room. And then, we\u2019re not being allowed to know what it says,\" Pompeo said on ABC News' \"This Week.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re not able to protect the State Department. We\u2019re not able to protect the United States of Ameria,\" he continued. \"And, Adam Schiff ought to be embarrassed by the kangaroo court that he's running.\"\n\nPompeo said he hoped those called before Congress will be entirely truthful, and when asked if he'll testify, he claimed he'll do everything he is \"required to do by law.\"\n\n\"I hope those officers who go to Capitol Hill will speak truthfully -- that they'll speak completely... [But] this has been unfair in the nth degree,\" he said earlier in the interview.\n\nREP. KINZINGER: ADAM SCHIFF'S 'SELECTIVE LEAKING' HAS TURNED IMPEACHMENT PUSH INTO A 'CLOWN SHOW'\n\nPompeo's comments came after 135 House Republicans signed off on a motion censuring Schiff for his \"parody\" reading of President Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, during a hearing last month.\n\n\u201cMy summary of the president\u2019s call was meant to be at least, part, in parody,\u201d Schiff said later about the incident. \u201cThe fact that that\u2019s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself. Of course, the president never said, \u2018If you don\u2019t understand me I\u2019m going to say it seven more times\u2019; my point is, that\u2019s the message that the Ukraine president was receiving in not so many words,\" he added.\n\nADAM SCHIFF THREATENS TO DEFUND INTEL COMMUNITY UNLESS TRUMP WHISTLEBLOWER DETAILS DISCLOSED\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, told \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d there was \u201cno evidence of a quid pro quo\u201d in Trump\u2019s phone call and slammed Democrats' efforts to impeach the president.\n\n\"At least have a vote on the House floor to move forward with this. It defies democracy,\" he said. \"All Adam Schiff is doing right now is building a secret record... in a one-sided process to move forward toward impeachment.\"", "description": "Rep.
