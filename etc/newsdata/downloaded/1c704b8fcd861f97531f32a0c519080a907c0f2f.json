He dominates goal-line work and should see scoring opportunities in a game with this week\u2019s highest total (55.5 points) by a wide margin. It makes sense to pay up for Deshaun Watson and DeAndre Hopkins in DFS this week as well.\n\nPringle popped for 103 yards and a score last week, and the Chiefs are likely to be without Sammy Watkins and, at best, will have a less-than-full-strength Tyreek Hill returning to the lineup. The Texans are tough against the run but have been gashed for the second-most fantasy points to outside receivers over the last month, so Pringle, who was in the top quarter-percentile in the 40, speed score, and college dominator, is a cheap DFS ($13) option worth taking a flier on this week.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers @ Los Angeles Rams\n\nStart: Jimmy Garoppolo, Gerald Everett\n\nGaroppolo ranks in the top-seven in TD% (6.2), On-Target% (81.4), sack% (3.4) and YPA (8.1) this season and faces a Rams funnel defense that\u2019s been much easier to beat through the air than the ground. San Francisco\u2019s missing offensive pieces (Mike McGlinchey, Kyle Juszczyk) are more important to its rushing attack, and this game features teams both ranking in the top-five in pace during neutral situations this year, so there are going to be a ton of plays Sunday.\n\n[Play in Yahoo\u2019s NFL $300K Baller. $10 entry fee and $30K to first place]\n\nStory continues\n\nEverett\u2019s seen a major snap% increase over the last two games, has forced more missed tackles than any other wide receiver or tight end in football and could continue to see an uptick in targets with Todd Gurley iffy to play, Brandin Cooks recovering from a concussion, and the team likely to use more 12 personnel against SF\u2019s dominant pass rush. Everett has the upside to be a top-five tight end from here on out.\n\nDallas Cowboys @ New York Jets\n\nStart: Michael Gallup\n\nSit: Robby Anderson\n\nThis should seem obvious for the NFL\u2019s leader in receiving yards per game (113.0), but Gallup\u2019s ECR is WR29 on Fantasy Pros, so it appears his stardom hasn\u2019t been properly recognized yet. He ranks sixth in WOPR and leads the NFL in yards per route run (3.49) by a mile (next best is Michael Thomas at 2.95). Gallup gets a plus matchup against the Jets and should be considered a top-15 wide receiver both this week and rest-of-season.\n\nLike a brilliant episode of \u201cSuccession,\u201d Anderson facing a tough cornerback has been a reliable weekly occurrence so far this year, with dominant Byron Jones the culprit this time. It definitely helps to get Sam Darnold back, but Anderson then gets Stephon Gilmore and Jalen Ramsey the next two weeks, so his epic run of bad luck, unfortunately, won\u2019t be ending soon.\n\nCarolina Panthers @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nStart: D.J. Moore, Ronald Jones\n\nMoore saw eight targets last week and should frequently be opposite Vernon Hargreaves, who\u2019s helped contribute to the Bucs allowing the most fantasy points to Moore\u2019s primary side over the last month.\n\nJones continues to share the backfield with Peyton Barber, but he\u2019s looked much-improved this season and should benefit Sunday from facing a Carolina run-funnel defense that ranks fourth against the pass but 29th versus the rush in DVOA.\n\nCincinnati Bengals @ Baltimore Ravens\n\nStart: Auden Tate\n\nStart in DFS: Mark Ingram ($27)\n\nTate mostly disappointed last week while dropping a touchdown early but added one late to salvage his fantasy day. He quietly has another plus matchup against a Ravens defense that\u2019s allowing the second-most yards-per-play (6.7) in the NFL this year and will likely be shadowing Tyler Boyd with tough corner, Marlon Humphrey.\n\nIngram\u2019s lack of involvement in the passing game remains a disappointment, but he saw a season-high 19 carries last week and is tied (with Aaron Jones and Frank Gore) for the NFL lead with six carries inside the three-yard line this season. Baltimore is 11-point home favorites and enters with a big advantage up front, so Ingram\u2019s setup is favorable.\n\nSeattle Seahawks @ Cleveland Browns\n\nStart: Will Dissly, Baker Mayfield\n\nDissly\u2019s scoring streak ended last week, but he managed a season-high in yards and gets a Cleveland defense that\u2019s ceded the seventh-most fantasy points to tight ends. He\u2019d become even more important if Denzel Ward and/or Greedy Williams are able to return to Cleveland\u2019s secondary this week.\n\nMayfield\u2019s INT% (5.0) and On-Target% (67.7) both rank last in the NFL, so he\u2019s no doubt been one of the bigger busts through the first part of the season. But a big issue has been the offensive line (and a coaching staff that needs to be overhauled). Seattle has struggled mightily pressuring the quarterback this season, so expect a bounce-back game from Mayfield and Odell Beckham Jr. after getting overwhelmed by a dominant SF pass rush.\n\nNew Orleans Saints @ Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nStart in DFS: Alvin Kamara ($29)\n\nStart: Dede Westbrook\n\nKamara\u2019s speed is utilized best at home, but he\u2019ll be tough to pass on in DFS this week assuming his ankle injury isn\u2019t serious. He\u2019s seeing a big workload with Teddy Bridgewater under center (his 22.3 touches over the last three games are four more than he averaged last season), and New Orleans faces a Jacksonville run defense that ranks last in DVOA and was just annihilated for 237 YFS and three scores by Christian McCaffrey last week.\n\nAlvin Kamara hasn't missed too much of a beat with Teddy Bridgewater under center. Mandatory Credit: Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWestbrook saw a season-high 11 targets last week, and while he\u2019s taken a clear backseat to DJ Chark, he\u2019ll benefit from facing a Saints defense that\u2019s yielded the second-most fantasy points to the slot over the last month. Jacksonville would be best off utilizing its short passing attack Sunday entering at a disadvantage in the trenches.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles @ Minnesota Vikings\n\nStart: Jordan Howard\n\nSit: Kirk Cousins\n\nHoward is touchdown-dependent and up against a tough Minnesota run defense, but he\u2019s scored five times over the last three games while outplaying rookie Miles Sanders (4.7 YPC vs. 3.6) and watching 36-year-old Darren Sproles get phased out of the offense. Philadelphia enters this game with a sizable advantage at the line on both sides of the ball.\n\nThe Eagles continue to have problems with their secondary, but don\u2019t talk yourself into Cousins this week, as he\u2019s likely to be overwhelmed by Philadelphia\u2019s pass rush. Cousins finally had a nice fantasy game last week versus a poor Giants defense, but he\u2019s otherwise been incredibly shaky while acting as just a caretaker. He\u2019s averaging 136.0 passing yards at home this year and should remain on fantasy benches.\n\nWashington Redskins @ Miami Dolphins\n\nStart: Adrian Peterson, Preston Williams\n\nNew interim coach Bill Callahan plans on establishing the run, so Peterson is scheduled for a big workload as favorites against a Miami run defense that ranks 31st in DVOA and has allowed the most fantasy points to backs this season.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to overlook Williams with the Dolphins winless and coming off a bye, but he racked up 19 targets over his previous two games and owns a target share (29%) with Josh Rosen under center that would rank second only to Michael Thomas among receivers this season. Williams gets a Washington secondary that\u2019s been struggling badly, allowing the fourth-most fantasy points to wide receivers and the most TD passes (13) in the NFL this year. DeVante Parker is another sneaky play this week (he\u2019s top-15 in air yards this season) against a Washington pass defense that ranks 28th in DVOA. It\u2019s clear, however, that Williams is Rosen\u2019s favorite target, making the rookie wideout an intriguing cheap DFS flier this week.\n\nAtlanta Falcons @ Arizona Cardinals\n\nStart: Mohamed Sanu, Christian Kirk\n\nSanu remains a big part of an offense that\u2019s on pace to approach the NFL record for pass attempts in a season, and he gets an Arizona secondary that\u2019s been shredded for the second-most fantasy points versus the slot, where Sanu has lined up 84% of the time this year.\n\nAssuming Kirk is ready to return this week, he gets an Atlanta defense that\u2019s been torched for the most fantasy points by wide receivers in 2019. The Cardinals are likely to struggle running against Atlanta with a hobbled David Johnson, so expect a ton of passes Sunday in another matchup featuring two teams in the top-five in pace (during neutral situations).\n\nTennessee Titans @ Denver Broncos\n\nSit: A.J. Brown\n\nStart: Emmanuel Sanders\n\nBrown should be rostered in most leagues and is going to be a future monster, but he\u2019s not being treated as the team\u2019s clear WR1 like he should be just yet (there are 75 wide receivers with a higher target share than Brown\u2019s 13%, including Donte Moncrief), and this week he gets a tough matchup with Chris Harris.\n\nTeammate Courtland Sutton is emerging as a star while leading all receivers in broken tackles, and defenses are likely to start focusing on stopping him first. Sanders is still just behind his teammate in target share despite seeing only one last week and should bounce back versus a middling Tennessee secondary.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers @ Los Angeles Chargers\n\nStart in DFS: James Conner ($24)\n\nSit: Philip Rivers\n\nConner has struggled this season with a 3.3 YPC mark, but he\u2019s going to be the focal point of Pittsburgh\u2019s offense Sunday night with Jaylen Samuels out and a second or third-stringer starting at quarterback. JuJu Smith-Schuster is a downgrade facing Casey Hayward and Desmond King, while Conner should benefit from the Steelers\u2019 advantage upfront.\n\nRivers will be missing center Mike Pouncey and should continue struggling with pressure all Sunday night against a Pittsburgh defense that\u2019s been among the toughest on fantasy quarterbacks this season. Moreover, the Chargers own the league\u2019s slowest pace in neutral situations this season, and they\u2019ll once again be playing a home game with more of the crowd cheering against them.\n\nDetroit Lions @ Green Bay Packers\n\nStart in DFS: Kerryon Johnson ($22)\n\nStart: Geronimo Allison\n\nJohnson had racked up 49 touches over his previous two games and should be fresh coming off a bye against a Green Bay run-funnel defense that ranks top-five against the pass and 28th versus the rush in DVOA. The Packers have allowed the third-most fantasy points to running backs, and the Lions enter with a huge edge in run blocking. Johnson should be treated as a borderline top-five fantasy back in Week 6.\n\nDetroit has allowed the fifth-fewest fantasy points to outside receivers but the sixth-most to the slot this season, and Davante Adams is banged up and unlikely to play. Marquez Valdes-Scantling could see a lot of Darius Slay, whereas slot corner Justin Coleman has been targeted a whopping 28% of his pass routes this season (among the highest in the league), so Allison figures to be busier than usual Monday night (when it\u2019s also set up for another big Aaron Jones game).\n\nFollow the Yahoo fantasy football crew on Twitter: Andy Behrens, Dalton Del Don, Brad Evans, Matt Harmon, Liz Loza, Scott Pianowski and Tank Williams\n\nListen to the Yahoo Fantasy Football Podcast", "description": "Dalton Del Don delivers his Week 6 Sits-Starts, including Kerryon Johnson, who should be treated as a top-five RB option vs. Green Bay.", "authors": ["Dalton Del Don"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zizlJDJcR3Mv2PIWoIwTVw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/84VHwUhqA7CaLWdjInE07g--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/669f9eb0-ec4b-11e9-9b77-91847a9d25c0", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
