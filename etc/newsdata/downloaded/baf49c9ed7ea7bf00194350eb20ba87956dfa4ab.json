Naidoo sweep the room Roland Pillay was staying in and where he hanged himself yesterday morning.\n\nPolice just missed finding Roland Pillay alive.\n\nSeven days after the brutal murder of his wife, Verusha Padayachee, police on Wednesday traced Pillay to a lodge in Central Durban where he had hanged himself an hour earlier.\n\nPillay is believed to have beaten and strangled Padayachee to death last Monday at her home in Lincoln Meade, Pietermaritzburg, before fleeing the scene in his wife\u2019s car, which did not have a tracker. The couple had a young child together.\n\nPillay disappeared following the murder of his wife and immediately became a suspect when it came to light that he had been seen leaving the complex in her car, and was later spotted buying painkillers and plasters from a local pharmacy.\n\nPietermaritzburg crime intelligence and Alexandra Road police station detectives took on the case, working around the clock to trace and arrest Pillay. Last Thursday police found Padayachee\u2019s damaged VW Polo in a forest in Hilton called Hilton Farm.\n\nRoland Pillay.\n\nThe sump had been damaged and the car could not move further. Electrical cord was found in the boot.\n\nPolice combed through the forest all of Thursday night and at the weekend, but could not find Pillay.\n\nIt is believed that after the murder, Pillay went to Reshape Gym in Raisethorpe, which he and his wife owned, and took money from the safe. He left his cellphones at the gym so he could not be traced.\n\nIt is believed Pillay may have had help in running from the law.\n\nHe apparently checked into the central Durban lodge last Wednesday.\n\nStaff reported he was very nervous, did not want house keeping to clean his room and was always wearing a big jacket and a hat.\n\nPolice had been in Durban since early Wednesday morning after tracing him to the city, but by the time they entered the lodge room, Pillay had already hanged himself.\n\nCellphones and a note was apparently found in his room.\n\nPillay\u2019s relative, who asked to remain unnamed, confirmed he had been found dead in Durban. The relative said Pillay committed suicide by hanging.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good but at least the family has some closure now because they didn\u2019t know what was going on. No matter what he did he was still family. When your own child dies no matter what the circumstances, it\u2019s just tragic,\u201d said the relative.\n\nPadayachee\u2019s family declined to comment.\n\nKZN police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said an inquest docket had been opened at the Point police station after Pillay was found hanging in the room.\n\nCrime Intelligence Captain Rumen Maistry and Alexandra police detective R. Naidoo spent days and sleepless nights tracking down Pillay.\n\nPeople took to The Witness Facebook page on Wednesday condemning Pillay as a coward and expressing anger that the couple\u2019s child had been left an orphan.", "description": "Police just missed finding Roland Pillay alive.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9322/45db0f864e24407f92141fc64d8678a7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
