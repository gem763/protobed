There were only partial operations during the weekend and limited services through the start of the week.\n\nHong Kong's economy has been hit hard by the protests, with many businesses and stores repeatedly closing as the Asian financial hub faces its first recession in a decade.\n\nLam warned on Tuesday the city's businesses faced \"a severe winter season\", while a police spokesman said more than 200 shops and public utilities had been damaged since Friday's violent clashes.\n\nMore than 100 restaurants have closed over the past month, putting around 2,000 people out of work, a representative from an association of catering professionals told public broadcaster RTHK on Wednesday.\n\nAuthorities have described protesters as \"militant activists\" but many Hong Kong residents are also angry at the emergency powers, fearing their civil rights could be eroded.\n\nMore than 2,300 people have been arrested since June, while two teenagers have been shot and wounded in skirmishes with police. Scores of people, including police, have been injured.\n\nThe political sensitivities involved have been highlighted by a growing row after an executive of the U.S. National Basketball Association (NBA) team the Houston Rockets backed the protests.\n\nOne-time U.S. presidential candidate and former First Lady Hillary Clinton and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver both weighed in to the controversy, drawing the ire of Chinese state media.", "description": "A Hong Kong pro-democracy activist jailed for six years for rioting in 2016 appeared in court on Wednesday to appeal against his sentence, as anti-government protests showed no signs of abating despite new emergency laws and widespread arrests.
