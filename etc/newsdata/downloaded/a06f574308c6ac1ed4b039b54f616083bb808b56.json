It\u2019s an important breakthrough and the first neuroprotective drug for patients with head injury.\n\n\u201cWe believe that, if our findings are widely implemented, they will boost the chances of people surviving head injuries in both high-income and low-income countries around the world.\u201d\n\nPatients were recruited from 175 hospitals across 29 countries.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
