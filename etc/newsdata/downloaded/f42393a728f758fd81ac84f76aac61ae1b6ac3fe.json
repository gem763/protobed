A decision on the law's constitutionality is pending in a federal appeals court, and the Trump administration has supported the case that seeks to overturn the law.\n\n\"The President has delivered lower costs and more options under the Affordable Care Act for two straight years, and this work reflects his overall approach to healthcare: protect what works and fix what's broken,\" Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said in a press release on Monday.\n\nRead more: Obamacare faced another critical moment in court. Over 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance if it's eventually struck down.\n\nThough acknowledging the law's success in helping restrain costs, Azar later criticized it as \"unaffordable\" for a significant slice of Americans.\n\n\"The ACA simply doesn't work and it is still unaffordable for far too many. But until Congress gets around to replacing it, President Trump will do what he can to fix the problems created by this system for millions of Americans,\" Azar said.\n\nAn average 27-year old acquiring a benchmark \"silver plan\" will pay an average premium of $388 a month and a family of four would pay $1,520 a month. However, the federal subsidies would absorb much or most of the cost.\n\nOpen enrollment in the federal exchanges is slated to take place from November 1 to December 15, and the states managing their own often have longer periods of enrollment. Azar said the law would remain in place should the federal panel rule in the plaintiff's favor.\n\nRead more: The number of Americans without health insurance jumped for the first time since the Obamacare debate kicked off in 2009\n\nThe administration also pointed out premiums remain high for those who don't qualify for subsidies, individuals who earn more than $49,960 or families of four earning more than $103,000 next year. CNN reported that 87% of people buying on the exchanges qualify for federal subsidies.\n\nThe additional insurers and falling premiums suggest the law may be stabilizing after several years of turmoil. Over 20 million Americans have gained coverage under Obamacare, according to the Urban Institute, a left-leaning think tank.\n\nStudies have shown that stabilization could have come earlier if the Trump adminstration hadn't sought to gut the law, as it repealed the individual mandate and expanding the number of plans exempt from the law's requirements.\n\n\"In a stable policy environment, average premiums for ACA-compliant plans would likely fall in 2019,\" Brookings Institute health policy fellow Matthew Fiedler wrote in September 2018. Instead, the Kaiser Family Foundation found earlier this year that average premiums stayed largely the same.", "description": "The Trump administration touted the announcement and lauded its own handling of the Affordable Care Act even as it still sought to end it.", "authors": ["Joseph Zeballos-Roig"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d0ce5e3e3ecba25093a8f25?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
