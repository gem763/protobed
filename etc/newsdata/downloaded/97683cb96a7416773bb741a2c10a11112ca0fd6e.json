She had been shot once in the mouth. Hussein had just broken up with her married boss, Daniel Kankam, who owned K-1 Tactical Security Services.\n\nAn Alexandria Circuit Court jury found Kankam, 44, guilty of first-degree murder and recommended he spend 26 years in prison.\n\nKankam initially claimed to police that he had left Hussein\u2019s apartment at about 2 a.m. the morning of her death and that she held onto his gun, according to a transcript of his interview with police. He pointed investigators to text messages he sent later that morning asking where Hussein was.\n\nBut a cellphone video taken by the victim showed Kankam in Hussein\u2019s apartment, with a gun, just before her death, while she tells him she wanted to end the relationship. A selfie on his phone showed that he was there while sending messages as if they were apart.\n\nHussein\u2019s roommate told investigators that she heard them arguing that night and that their relationship was volatile and violent. Kankam sent Hussein threatening messages in the days before her death, and he told a friend he might \u201ccut the head of the snake off.\u201d\n\nPolice found bloody clothing, the gun, and a fired cartridge case in a bag after Kankam\u2019s wife tried to throw them away, according to court filings.\n\nKankam himself maintained he was not in the room when Hussein died and did not know what had happened to her; his lawyers suggested she had killed herself.\n\nRead more:\n\nProsecutors say an alleged member of a white-supremacist group was involved with illegal guns, drugs\n\nA 7-year-old is the key witness against the man charged in her little brother\u2019s death.
