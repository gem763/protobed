Horowitz announced on Thursday his report would be available to the public soon, with \"few\" redactions.\n\nThe investigation's new status means Durham can subpoena witnesses and file charges, as well as impanel fact-finding grand juries. Fox News reported on Tuesday that Durham's probe had expanded significantly based on new evidence uncovered during a recent trip to Rome with Attorney General Bill Barr.\n\nSources told Fox News that Durham was \"very interested\" to question former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA Director John Brennan, an anti-Trump critic who recently dismissed the idea.\n\nGOP REVEALS NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN STRZOK TEXTS DISCUSSING 'CRESCENDO OF LEAKS'\n\nThe two Obama administration officials were at the helm when the unverified and largely discredited dossier, written by British ex-spy Christopher Steele and funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, was used to justify a secret surveillance warrant against former Trump adviser Carter Page.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Thursday that Durham's criminal review has prompted some CIA officials to obtain criminal legal counsel in anticipation of being interviewed.\n\nIn Italy, Barr reportedly told embassy officials he \"needed a conference room to meet high-level Italian security agents where he could be sure no one was listening in.\"\n\nA source in the Italian Ministry of Justice told The Daily Beast earlier this month that Barr and Durham were played a taped deposition made by Joseph Mifsud, the professor who allegedly told ex-Trump aide George Papadopoulos that the Russians had \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton. Mifsud reportedly was explaining to authorities in the deposition why people would want to harm him, and why he needed police protection.\n\nPapadopoulos has suggested he was connected with Mifsud as part of a setup orchestrated by intelligence agencies.\n\nAlso on Thursday, top Republicans revealed never-before-seen texts from fired FBI agent Peter Strzok, in which he apparently discussed systemic leaking at the bureau.\n\nDISPUTE ERUPTS AS BRENNAN, COMEY APPEAR TO DISPUTE WHO PUSHED THE STEELE DOSSIER\n\nSenate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, revealed the texts in a letter to the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) requesting an update on whether the FBI's apparent leaks to the media were being probed.\n\nThe senators pushed to know whether the ICIG was looking into Strzok's email to FBI colleagues on April 13, 2017, when he wrote that an unidentified \"agency\" might be the \"source of some of the leaks\" to the media that he'd been seeing.\n\n\"I'm beginning to think the agency got info a lot earlier than we thought and hasn't shared it completely with us,\" Strzok wrote, according to documents that the senators included in their letter to the ICIG. \"Might explain all these weird/seemingly incorrect leads all these media folks have. Would also highlight agency as a source of some of the leaks.\"\n\nThe senators also asked why Strzok texted bureau colleague Lisa Page on Dec. 15, 2016: \"Think our sisters have begun leaking like mad. Scorned and worried and political, they're kicking in to overdrive.\"\n\n\"What are they worried about, and what are they kicking into 'overdrive?' Johnson and Grassley wrote. \"Who are the 'sisters,' and what does it mean to say that the 'sisters have [been] leaking like mad'?\"\n\nIn a June 6, 2017 email to Page, Strzok mused, \"Think there will be a crescendo of leaks/articles leading up to Thurs.\"\n\nREAD THE FULL LETTER TO ATKINSON, INCLUDING THE NEWLY RELEASED STRZOK TEXTS\n\nAnd, a Dec. 13, 2016 text message apparently showed Strzok trying to set up a Skype meeting with a reporter. \"Text from reporter: retrieving my password for Skype,\" he wrote.\n\nHorowitz, the DOJ watchdog, faulted the FBI last year for repeated violations of its media communications policy, noting that agents had received gifts from reporters and leaked regularly.\n\nThen, on April 6, 2017, Strzok wrote to senior FBI leadership to complain about a New York Times article entitled, \"C.I.A. Had Evidence of Russian Effort to Help Trump Earlier Than Believed,\" claiming it painted the FBI in an unfavorable light and got key facts wrong.\n\n\"Mike, below is inaccurate, favors the CIA at the expense of the FBI in particular, and is at odds with what Apuzzo and Goldman know,\" Strzok wrote. \"Most importantly, it's at odds with the D's [FBI Director's] recent public testimony that we've been looking at links (which necessarily imply favoring Trump) since July '16.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nStrzok specifically objected to the Times' reporting that CIA's briefings with lawmakers \"indicate that intelligence officials had evidence of Russia\u2019s intentions to help Mr. Trump much earlier in the presidential campaign than previously thought,\" and \"reveal a critical split last summer between the C.I.A. and counterparts at the F.B.I., where a number of senior officials continued to believe through last fall that Russia\u2019s cyberattacks were aimed primarily at disrupting America\u2019s political system, and not at getting Mr. Trump elected, according to interviews.\"\n\nFox News' Jake Gibson contributed to this report.", "description": "U.S. Attorney John Durham's ongoing probe into potential FBI and DOJ misconduct has transitioned into a full-fledged criminal investigation, two sources familiar with the investigation told Fox News on Thursday.", "authors": ["Gregg Re", "Gregg Re Is A Lawyer", "Editor Based In Los Angeles.
