It doesn't work,\" marine campaigner Lawrence Chlebeck said in a statement.\n\nDespite tens of millions of visits to the beach in Australia annually, shark attacks remain rare.\n\nThere were 27 attacks in the country's waters in 2018, according to data compiled by Sydney's Taronga Zoo.", "description": "Tourism operators want aerial shark patrols to be introduced in Australia's Whitsunday Islands as they try to stem falling visitor numbers following a spate...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/05/wire-20361988-1572415097-47_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
