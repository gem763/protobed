It's difficult to win in Australia and to do it so comprehensively was a really proud moment in my coaching career. It was wonderful to watch those young men take on that challenge successfully and have a great time doing it.\n\n'The win in India in 2012-13 was a highlight too, to overcome some great players in tough spinning conditions was a special victory.\n\n'So was the T20 World Cup win in 2010. The way we played our cricket, with such freedom and aggression, really was fun to be part of.'\n\nFlower's tenure unravelled in a 5-0 Ashes collapse in 2013-14, stepping down in the aftermath\n\nOn a man who took England to number one in the Test rankings before his tenure unravelled spectacularly with a 5-0 whitewashing by the Australians in 2013-14, Ashley Giles, England's managing director, said: 'Andy moves on with every best wish from all of us at ECB for his outstanding contribution to the English game.\n\n'It has been a pleasure working with Andy, who sets such high standards of professionalism and preparation for the teams he leads. I have no doubt he will enjoy further success in the years to come.'\n\nIronically, it was tension between Flower and Giles in splitting the coaching roles of the Test and limited-overs teams that led to the latter's term being short-lived.\n\nZimbabwean Flower will continue to reside in the UK and intends to move into a life of franchise coaching on the global Twenty20 circuit.", "description": "Three-time Ashes winning coach Andy Flower has left the ECB after 12 years following a reshuffle.
