It could be used to lure police into an area'.\n\nHe told the Daily Telegraph: 'We have seen in the past year that they have carried out a wide range of attacks, such as bombs under cars, secondary devices, rockets have been discovered we have seen the full range of terrorist technology being deployed against officers.\n\n'But they are small in number. Any campaign they carry out will not be on the same scale [as the Troubles].'\n\nSimon Byrne, chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland [PSNI], has already said he will not let officers patrol the border if there is No Deal because of the threat.\n\nBoris Johnson's fresh proposals on how to solve the Northern Ireland border issue were given a warm reception by Irish premier Leo Varadkar last week.\n\nThe PSNI won't patrol border in event of No Deal Brexit as result of security concerns, its chief constable has said\n\nBut Mr Barnier said there had not been 'as much progress' as hoped during a briefing last night to update member states.\n\nHe said Britain had failed to provide enough detail on the issue of customs, which has dogged talks surrounding the backstop, designed to prevent a hard border in Ireland.\n\nMr Barnier stopped short of calling off the talks, which will continue today and tomorrow.\n\nBut his bleak assessment dampened hopes of an imminent breakthrough, which is needed if Britain is to leave the EU on October 31 as Mr Johnson repeatedly promises.\n\nOne senior EU diplomat said: 'It's a kind of Groundhog Day that continues tomorrow on customs.'\n\nAnother added: 'It'll be difficult to have a legal text ready for the summit, but still not impossible if there's some movement.'A third diplomat said: 'There's momentum but probably not enough time. Negotiations are, as expected, not easy. But they are moving forward.'\n\nEU officials had already privately said there was little chance of reaching a deal in time.\n\nMr Johnson's plan involves creating two customs areas on the island of Ireland, which one senior EU source close to the negotiations described as 'mind-bogglingly' complex. They added: 'This requires careful legal work you can't do hastily. That makes it all very tricky.'\n\nThe plan would see Northern Ireland being subject to EU customs tariffs as goods cross the Irish Sea from mainland Britain.But Northern Irish businesses would claim back rebates, meaning it would de facto remain within UK customs jurisdiction.\n\nA meeting of EU foreign ministers will take place tomorrow in Luxembourg, where they ideally want sight of final proposals.\n\nUnder the terms of the so-called Benn Act, Mr Johnson must accept whatever extension is offered by the EU if there is no agreement before October 31.\n\nAny new legal text will have to be translated into all of the bloc's languages and subjected to scrutiny by its legal services.\n\nThe EU parliament must then pass it, where it would have to go through committee hearings before facing a full vote. One EU source said it was 'really unlikely' all these processes could take place by the end of the month.\n\nA UK Government spokesman said there had been 'constructive discussions' but that there is still 'a significant amount of work to be done'.\n\nBorder problem in Ireland? Boris has a plan for that: How journey of a fridge explains how Brexit deal may work\n\nWhat was the original plan?\n\nHow the journey of a fridge explains how the deal may just work\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s original plan would have seen Northern Ireland leave the EU customs union, while remaining part of the single market.\n\nDublin argued this would require a customs border, which would break the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nIn addition, EU said it would not accept Mr Johnson\u2019s call to waive or simplify customs rules to keep cross-border trade in Ireland as frictionless as possible. The British plan had been to have customs checks \u2018away from either side of the border\u2019 but this was dismissed by critics as \u2018vague\u2019.\n\nThe original plan would have given the Northern Ireland Assembly a vote every four years on the new arrangements.\n\nDublin said this was effectively handing a near permanent veto to the Democratic Unionists at Stormont.\n\nWhat has changed?\n\nMr Johnson met Irish premier Leo Varadkar in Merseyside on Thursday with little hope of progress. But after three hours of talks they both agreed on a \u2018pathway to a possible deal\u2019.\n\nWhat they agreed is not yet fully known. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay put an outline to the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier yesterday in a meeting described as \u2018constructive\u2019.\n\nWill it solve customs issue?\n\nSources claimed yesterday that Mr Johnson has agreed to effectively scrap any customs border between NI and the Republic \u2013 and replace it with a scheme under which the province will be in both the EU and the UK customs zones simultaneously.\n\nCustoms checks would take place at a new administrative border on the Irish Sea, with firms paying EU tariffs on goods travelling from the British mainland to Northern Ireland.\n\nIt would mean the UK would collect tariffs on goods on behalf of the EU. Goods to Ireland will then be free to travel there without any stop at the border. If the goods are destined for NI, firms could claim a rebate to take into account a potentially lower UK tariff.\n\nThe single market?\n\nNI would stay \u2018aligned\u2019 to the EU\u2019s rules and regulations. Checks would take place when goods are travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland, obviating the need for checks between Ulster and the Republic.\n\nSounds familiar?\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s plan has its roots in the \u2018customs partnership\u2019 once championed by Theresa May. This also would have seen NI effectively remain in the customs union but still able to take advantage of UK trade deals.\n\nLast year, Mr Johnson described the idea as a \u2018crazy system whereby you end up collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU at the UK frontier\u2019 \u2013 exactly what he is now proposing. The EU also rejected the idea.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s plan relates only to Northern Ireland, while Mrs May\u2019s took in the whole UK. This reduces the level of bureaucracy as the trade between the mainland and Ulster is clearly lower than the huge volumes flowing into ports such as Felixstowe and Dover.\n\nAnd Stormont?\n\nMr Johnson is understood to have dropped the four-yearly Stormont votes plan. Some form of democratic \u2018consent\u2019 is likely if only to honour the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nWhat next?\n\nThe other 27 EU members yesterday agreed to open intensive \u2018tunnel\u2019 negotiations on the latest proposals.Accelerated negotiations will take place over the weekend and could be wrapped up by Wednesday. If a deal is thrashed out in Brussels then it could be put to a vote in Westminster next Saturday, October 19.\n\nWill MPs buy it?\n\nHe\u2019s largely given up on the bulk of Labour MPs who are determined to stop a \u2018Tory Brexit\u2019 at all costs. The Lib Dems and the SNP will also vote against. No 10 will spend the week convincing Tory Remainers who were thrown out to now climb back on board. However, the chances of a deal being rubberstamped remain slim.", "description": "The Republican terrorists remain a 'small but deadly' force despite numbers dwindling to around 100 people and they will try to kill police, Mark Lindsay, head of Northern Ireland's policing union has said.", "authors": ["Martin Robinson", "Chief Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/09/19681140-0-image-a-8_1571040111332.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
