Anibal Sanchez, P\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t already obvious, the Houston Astros are in trouble. They trail the Washington Nationals, 2-0, in the best-of-seven World Series, having lost both games at home. According to MLB.com, teams that have gone up 2-0 in a best-of-seven postseason series have gone on to prevail in 71 of 84 instances. The last team to come back from a 0-2 deficit was the Boston Red Sox against the Yankees in the 2004 American League Championship Series, which they won in seven games after losing the first three. The Red Sox went on to claim the World Series title. The last example in the World Series: The 1996 Yankees, who dropped the first two games and then won four straight to win the crown.\n\nThe Astros need Zack Greinke, a six-time All-Star and the 2009 A.L. Cy Young Award winner, more than ever. They landed him in a blockbuster July 31 trade to fortify their starting rotation with a World Series in mind. He is starting Game 3 and will be opposed by the Nationals\u2019 Anibal Sanchez. While Greinke might be the better pitcher, Sanchez is no slouch; he had a 3.85 earned run average during the regular season and features an array of diving and darting pitches. He has allowed just one run in 12 2/3 innings this postseason. Greinke, on the hand, was torched for six runs in the first round by the Tampa Bay Rays and then allowed four runs in 10 1/3 innings against the Yankees. Perhaps the biggest reason the Astros need Greinke: they have only three starters on their World Series roster. Jose Urquidy and Brad Peacock, who started the Astros\u2019 bullpen game in the last round, have both started games in the regular season, but neither are of the same caliber of Nationals\u2019 Game 4 starter: Patrick Corbin.\n\nIt is Juan Soto\u2019s birthday on Friday. He is the ripe age of 21 now \u2014 much younger than the rest of his team of \u201cviejos.\u201d Soto, the Nationals\u2019 star left fielder, is hitting cleanup in Game 3; he leads all players in the World Series with three extra-base hits. The Astros, on the other hand, had a notable decision to make about Yordan Alvarez, their power-hitting rookie outfielder. He was their main designated hitter during the regular season, but the third outfield spot alongside George Springer and Michael Brantley has been mainly manned this postseason by Kyle Tucker or Josh Reddick, both more capable defenders than Alvarez. Astros Manager A.J. Hinch did not put Alvarez in the lineup on Friday, but said he expected Alvarez to bat in Game 3. Hinch has said Alvarez would man Nationals Park\u2019s large left field at some point.\n\nWashington is hosting its first World Series game since 1933, when the Senators lost the series, 4-1, to the New York Giants. The Senators\u2019 roster included such players as Ossie Bluege, Joe Cronin, Goose Goslin, General Crowder and Heinie Manush.", "description": "Zack Greinke will start for Houston and Anibal Sanchez will be on the mound for Washington as the Astros try to come back from their two-games-to-none deficit.", "authors": ["James Wagner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/sports/25series-live-1/merlin_163313442_45f46a73-dcb8-4262-a0f2-d4909e69e999-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
