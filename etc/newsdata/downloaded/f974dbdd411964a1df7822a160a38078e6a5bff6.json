Pruitt deemed the standards set for model year cars from 2022-2025 were no longer appropriate. The state argued the EPA failed to adequately explain and provide detailed analyses backing up the decision to change the regulations.\n\nThe suit was one of a series of challenges the state and others have lobbed in the past year against the Trump administration over the car emissions rule.\n\nMost recently, California in September sued the EPA for issuing part of a final rule that removes the state\u2019s ability to establish its own pollution standards.\n\nCalifornia has long argued it has the congressional right under the Clean Air Act to establish its own more stringent air pollution standards than federal regulations dictate. California, along with 23 other states, sued the Trump administration over the waiver removal.\n\nThe first part of the EPA's rule comes as it is finalizing changes to the federal tailpipe emissions standards. The administration has not yet released the finalized second part of the rule, which will determine the levels of emissions allowable from passenger vehicles, but it\u2019s expected to be less rigorous than the previous rule established under Obama.", "description": "A federal appeals court on Friday dismissed challenges brought by the state of California against a Trump administration rule on t", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/highway_495_022318gn9_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
