Reid and Associates -- it developed the interrogation technique showcased in the series -- claims that \"When They See Us\" sheds a negative light on the procedure and implies that it involves coercion.\n\n'WHEN THEY SEE US' DIRECTOR AVA DUVERNAY AND 'EXONERATED FIVE' TALK LINDA FAIRSTEIN BACKLASH DURING OPRAH SPECIAL\n\n\u201cDefendants intended to incite an audience reaction against Reid for what occurred in the Central Park jogger case and for the coercive interrogation tactics that continue to be used today,\u201d the suit reads. \u201cDefendants published the statements in 'When They See Us' in an effort to cause a condemnation of the Reid technique.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit refers to a specific instance in which it's alleged that the Reid technique was poorly dramatized. Per Variety, a district attorney's office employee confronts a detective in the case, saying: \"You squeezed statements out of them after 42 hours of questioning and coercing, without food, bathroom breaks, withholding parental supervision. The Reid technique has been universally rejected.\"\n\nAVA DUVERNAY'S CENTRAL PARK FIVE MINISERIES CALLED AN 'OUTRIGHT FABRICATION' BY EX-PROSECUTOR LINDA FAIRSTEIN\n\nThe detective responds: \u201cI don\u2019t even know what the f\u2014ing Reid technique is, OK? I know what I was taught. I know what I was asked to do and I did it.\u201d\n\nReid and Associates also claims the program has caused harm to the company's reputation, and the firm is seeking actual and punitive damages.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFinally, the plaintiff asks for Netflix to stop distributing the show in its current form, and for a disgorgement of Netflix\u2019s profits from the show.\n\nA rep for Netflix and a lawyer for DuVernay had no comment when reached by Fox News.", "description": "Netflix and Director Ava DuVernay have been sued over their portrayal of the Reid interrogation technique in the Emmy-winning mini-series \"When They See Us.\"", "authors": ["Nate Day"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/wrinkle_time3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
