FBI agent questions Russian lawmaker, offers \u2018informal\u2019 meeting", "language": "en", "text": "The Russian embassy in Washington has filed a note of protest with the State Department and the FBI, after parliament member Inga Yumasheva was detained at a New York airport and questioned by a US federal agent.\n\nYumasheva, who travelled to the United States to participate in the annual Fort Ross Dialogue forum, was taken to a separate room upon landing and interrogated for over an hour, asking \u201cobscure and unacceptable questions,\u201d according to Russian ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov.\n\nMoreover, she was offered to meet with the FBI officer in an informal setting to continue the conversation\n\nSo far it remains unclear what exactly Yumasheva was questioned about. Slamming the incident as unacceptable and outrageous attempt to disrupt yet another platform of communication between Americans and Russians, the embassy demanded explanation from the State Department.\n\nCan\u2019t even imagine [what would happen if Russian] security services detained one of US senators or representatives... took them to a private room, interrogated and then invited them to a nearby restaurant for a cup of coffee.\n\nAlso on rt.com Moscow may ban green card lottery after US fails to grant visas to Russia\u2019s UN delegation, MP says\n\nThe annual Fort Ross Dialogue forum will be held in California on October 6 is aimed at finding a common ground through public diplomacy and discussions. Yet some in Washington seem to reject any rapprochement with Moscow whatsoever, as a trip of Russian Foreign Ministry representatives to Fort Ross was disrupted this week.\n\nPreviously, Washington refused to issue visas for nearly a dozen members of the Russian delegation to a United Nations summit in New York, abusing its status as the host of the UN headquarters.\n\nAlso on rt.com Western dominance is on the wane, \u2018we\u2019re liberals so everything\u2019s allowed\u2019 just isn\u2019t working anymore \u2013 Lavrov at UNGA\n\nLike this story?
