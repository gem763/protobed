Curious and concerned, Kathleen took a look at what her husband was doing on the internet.\n\nWhat was he doing online?\n\nShe discovered he\u2019d been visiting adult sites, featuring fetishes such as bondage.\n\nBy now Fifty Shades Of Grey was topping bestseller lists around the world. But there was something darker about one of the websites.\n\nIt featured a picture of a dead woman.\n\nWorried, Kathleen told her husband about what she\u2019d seen.\n\nBut getting her concerns out in the open didn\u2019t help their marriage, and Gilberto became more withdrawn.\n\nSo Kathleen turned detective herself\n\nDownloading spyware, software that can secretly monitor how a computer or phone is being used, she unearthed Gilberto\u2019s hidden email account.\n\nInside were thousands of messages between her husband and some mysterious online contacts.\n\nIf she\u2019d feared he might be cheating on her, the revelations in these emails were even worse.\n\nReading in horror, Kathleen saw messages describing her being tied up and having her throat slit by her husband and these \u2018friends\u2019.\n\nIf she cries out, don\u2019t show her mercy, one of the contacts urged. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll gag her, was his chilling reply.\n\nAs well as her own death, there were messages about Kathleen\u2019s friends too. They talked about stuffing them into suitcases before raping, killing and roasting them on a fire. Her hubby had even shared photos of her with his online friends.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, I\u2019m seeing pictures of me, pictures of our friends,\u201d Kathleen would later tearfully tell a court. And she found photos of severed human feet.\n\nTime to go\n\nShaken and disturbed, Kathleen took her daughter from their apartment to her family home. There, she handed her laptop and apartment keys to the FBI so they could investigate.\n\nExamining Gilberto Valle\u2019s computer, investigators found a chilling file.\n\nNamed Abducting and Cooking, it listed items that could be used to kidnap someone, such as rope and chloroform. And his Google searches showed he\u2019d searched for recipes for \u2018human flesh\u2019.\n\nWas Valle planning to kill and eat his wife?\n\nThey also found details belonging to women Valle knew, including former classmates.\n\nHe wrote about plans to \u2018kidnap, rape, torture, kill, cook and eat body parts\u2019. One of his online user names was Girlmeat Hunter.\n\nBut had Valle actually tried to turn any of these ideas into action? Records showed he\u2019d accessed the police database to get more information about a particular woman. And he\u2019d reached out to some other women, asking about their routines and jobs.\n\nIn February 2012, Valle appeared to offer to kidnap a woman for one of his connections. $5000 and she is all yours, he wrote. Then FBI agents discovered Valle had been using his phone close to where the woman lived.\n\nIn October 2012, Gilberto Valle was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit kidnapping.\n\nThe Cannibal Cop\n\nWhen the sensational case hit the headlines, Valle was dubbed the \u2018Cannibal Cop\u2019.\n\nGiving evidence for the prosecution, Kathleen sobbed in court, convinced her husband planned to kill her.\n\nProsecutors claimed that Valle had meticulously researched potential victims to live out his depraved fantasies of murder and cannibalism.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d lawyer Randall Jackson said. \u201cGilberto Valle was very serious about these plans.\u201d\n\nThe defence team were adamant the messages were not signs of any real-life threat and just role-play.\n\nDefence lawyer Julia Gatto told the court, \u201cThere is no actual crossing the line from fantasy to reality.\u201d\n\nHowever, in March 2013, a jury at Federal District Court in Manhattan found Valle guilty of conspiracy to kidnap and of an offence relating to his misuse of the police database.\n\nValle appealed against the decision, asking the trial judge Paul G Gardephe to overturn the verdict, or grant him a new trial.\n\nFreedom\n\nWhile the judge\u2019s decision was pending, Valle wasn\u2019t sentenced.\n\nAnd in July 2014, Judge Gardephe threw out the conviction, saying there wasn\u2019t enough evidence that Valle was actually planning to harm real-life women.\n\nValle was released after spending 21 months in prison, and his conviction for accessing information was later overturned.\n\nBy March 2015, Valle raised eyebrows again when he set up an online dating profile, listing \u2018cooking\u2019 as a hobby. And last year he defended his depraved messages in a TV interview.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a crime to fantasise about committing crimes against people you know. It\u2019s action [that\u2019s illegal],\u201d he told Inside Edition. \u201cWhat I do at home is my business.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the so-called Cannibal Cop revealed he planned to cash in on his notoriety \u2013 by publishing a violent novel about sadists in New York.\n\n\u201cYou know [the] old clich\u00e9, make lemonade out of lemons,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story originally appeared in That's Life and is republished here with permission.", "description": "When Kathleen checked her husband\u2019s computer, she knew she\u2019d find something bad \u2013 but nothing could have prepared her for this (WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT).", "authors": ["Sarah Firth"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/276425e16ffe190bbce19f85e24151c1", "published_at": "2018-05-02"}
