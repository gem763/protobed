Weekend attacks which took out roughly half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s crude output appear to fit that bill. But even fragile global growth can probably withstand this first cut.\n\nBrent crude prices rose by as much as a fifth on Monday morning, the biggest intra-day percentage gain since the 1991 Gulf War. While prices were up less than 10% in later trading, that\u2019s still a big jump. Sharp hikes in energy costs caused by supply shocks usually hurt global growth. The more consumers and businesses have to pay for oil and oil products, the less they have to spend on other things. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2011 estimated that a sustained $10 jump in the cost of a barrel of oil would knock 0.2 percentage points off its members\u2019 growth in the second year after the shock.\n\nIt may take weeks rather than days to get Saudi production back to normal. However, the kingdom\u2019s reserves can make up for a temporary shortfall. OECD countries, meanwhile, have inventories of oil and oil products that are equivalent to about 60 days of total demand and most of them are above the International Energy Agency\u2019s reserve requirement for 90 days of net imports, according to UBS analysts. U.S. President Donald Trump has already authorised the release of oil from America\u2019s strategic reserves if needed and said this would be enough to keep markets well-supplied. The United States can also ramp up production of shale oil within months in response to higher energy prices. The world is becoming progressively less dependent on Saudi oil.\n\nYet with both the United States and China grappling with a slowdown, there\u2019s little room for complacency. The Iran-aligned Houthi movement said on Monday that Saudi Aramco\u2019s oil processing plants were still a target and could be attacked at \u201cany moment\u201d. United States rhetoric towards Iran is increasingly bellicose. Sustained disruptions to Middle Eastern oil supply \u2013 or anything that heightens the risk of them \u2013 will buoy crude. That will deliver the deepest cut to growth.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - The last thing the slowing world economy needs is a big and unexpected disruption in oil output.
