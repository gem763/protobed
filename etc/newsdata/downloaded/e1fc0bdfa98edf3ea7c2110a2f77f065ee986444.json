Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) announced on Saturday that she is officially endorsing Democratic candidate for president Bernie Sanders. The anticipated endorsement was reported earlier this week by Townhall's Matt Vespa.\n\nOcasio-Cortez tweeted, \"In the end, we must come together to defeat Donald Trump. We should do so knowing he is a symptom of a larger problem - and our greatest hope is a multiracial, working class movement in the United States of America.\"\n\nToday I am endorsing Senator @BernieSanders for president.\n\n\n\nIn the end, we must come together to defeat Donald Trump. We should do so knowing he is a symptom of a larger problem - and our greatest hope is a multiracial, working class movement in the United States of America. pic.twitter.com/9fiTS7FTX9 \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 19, 2019\n\nThe tweet includes a three-minute video from the Sanders campaign, featuring Ocasio-Cortez reminiscing about the first time she felt the Bern.\n\n\"The first time I ever heard about Bernie Sanders, was when I was a waitress in a greasy spoon diner type of restaurant in downtown Manhattan, and I had been working 12 hour days. I didn't have health insurance. I was being paid less than a living wage. And I didn't think that I deserved any of those things,\" Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nThe freshman congresswoman credits Sen. Sanders for inspiring her political career. \"The only reason that I thought running for office was even possible for me was because of his example. Because he proved that you could run for office and not take big money.\"\n\nA self-described democratic socialist, Ocasio-Cortez explains why she is endorsing fellow-socialist Bernie Sanders for president.\n\n\"And when he talks about a political revolution, and when he talks about 'Not me, us', those aren't slogans. This is not about me. This is not about Senator Sanders. This is what we have to accomplish together. This is not about saying everyone should have health care with some asterisks, or that your student loan debt should be forgiven under certain conditions. This is about unconditional, universal, guaranteed advanced standard of living in the United States of America.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez then called for \"a revolution of working class people, and it needs to be multi-racial, multi-gendered, multi-generational.\" Apparently, she couldn't think of any more \"multi's.\"\n\nAlso on Saturday, Ocasio-Cortez joined Sen. Sanders at a campaign rally in New York City. It was the first campaign rally for Sanders since his heart attack earlier this month.", "description": "Rep.
