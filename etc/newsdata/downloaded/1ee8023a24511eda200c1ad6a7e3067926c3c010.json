It took him four days to pull back that proclamation.\n\nThe former Pittsburgh Steelers, Oakland Raiders and New England Patriots wide receiver indicated in a tweet Thursday that he very much plans to keep playing football.\n\nAntonio Brown does not seem to be retiring\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nI\u2019m still the best why stop now \u2014 AB (@AB84) September 26, 2019\n\nThe game need me I\u2019m like test answers \u2014 AB (@AB84) September 26, 2019\n\nOf course, Brown\u2019s willingness to play in the NFL is only half the battle at this point. After Brown was cut by the Patriots, the NFL announced that its investigation into sexual assault allegations against the receiver was still ongoing and signing him before the investigation is completed could result in him being placed on the commissioner\u2019s restricted list.\n\nSo if a team wants to sign Brown before the NFL finishes the investigation, it runs the risk of being unable to play him while still having to pay him.\n\nAmid a forced hiatus from the NFL, Antonio Brown remains quite active on Twitter. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)\n\nBrown naturally indicated he still believes he could land with a new team by the end of 2019.\n\nAntonio Brown remains combative on Twitter\n\nStory continues\n\nA few hours later, because this is Antonio Brown, the 31-year-old also took shots at Nike, which dropped him after the sexual assault allegations emerged, and Sports Illustrated reporter Robert Klemko, whose reporting on Brown receiving another sexual misconduct accusation and his subsequent alleged harassment of the accuser led to Brown\u2019s release from the Patriots.\n\nWith Klemko, Brown referred to a 2014 incident in which the reporter was arrested for a physical altercation with a cab driver that resulted in a four-week suspension from Sports Illustrated.\n\nNo more Nikes \u2014 AB (@AB84) September 26, 2019\n\nsports illustrated reporter who got assault on his record will probably say AB thinks the game needs him then 50 analyst will sprinkle \ud83e\uddc2 https://t.co/f2jLdhSgKJ \u2014 AB (@AB84) September 26, 2019\n\nAntonio Brown vs. Eric Weddle\n\nBrown\u2019s day on Twitter naturally continued with Los Angeles Rams safety Eric Weddle, who played against Brown several times during his stint with the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nThe exchange began when Weddle seemed to disagree with Brown\u2019s assessment of himself, then got in some decent shots against the receiver.\n\nDef dont \u2014 Eric Weddle (@weddlesbeard) September 26, 2019\n\nNot sure bro.
