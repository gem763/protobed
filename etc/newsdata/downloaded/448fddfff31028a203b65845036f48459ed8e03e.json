It's also the only real look we've had so far at the pair's new addition to the family.\n\nI love B.C. \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 I want my daughters to experience the same natural playground I grew up in.

Blake, proud mama, is absolutely beaming up at Ryan, whose hand is seen resting atop his wife's head, with their new baby in between them both.\n\nView photos\n\nReynolds' tweet was part of a politically-charged comment surrounding Canada's upcoming elections and how important it is to ensure we're all doing our part to help reduce the impact of climate change. Given that Ryan likely wanted as many eyes to see it as humanly possible, including the sweet new family photo was a smart way to do just that.\n\nRELATED: Blake Lively's Baby Registry Proves She's Not a Normal Mom, She's a Cool Mom\n\nReynolds and Lively typically aren't very forthcoming when it comes to sharing photos of their children, or offering much information at all. While the the family hasn't officially come out and announced their newborn's sex just yet, it's safe to say from Ryan's caption that he and Blake are now the proud parents of three girls.\n\nRyan and Blake are parents to 4-year-old James and 3-year-old Inez. Their third child arrived earlier this summer, though news only just arrived earlier in October. The actress first debuted her pregnancy after making a splash during May's Detective Pikachu movie premiere in New York City. Decked out in a sunny yellow dress with matching nails to channel the film's titular electric mouse, she made headlines after appearing with Ryan while noticeably pregnant.\n\nRecently, Blake shared her Amazon baby registry in a bid to help other expectant mothers deduce exactly what they might need to prep for their own new additions.\n\n\"I understand how overwhelming it is to be a new parent. What they don't tell you is it never gets less overwhelming, but with each kid I do learn more,\" Lively shared. \"Before I had my first, I was lucky enough to have the parents in my life who I trusted most share their 'must haves' with me. I hope to do the same for you with my baby registry picks. Good luck! You're gonna' need it.\"\n\nAs Baby No. 3 continues to grow alongside her obviously loving parents, hopefully we'll get a better look at the infant in the months to come.", "description": "Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds shared fans' first look at their newborn baby daughter with a sweet family photo on Twitter.", "authors": ["Brittany Vincent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/J5HVhQhvyjDXM0ikkrq6Kg--~B/aD0yNTgyO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/instyle_846/83ef93344d3cef898feef040e238dbb2", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
