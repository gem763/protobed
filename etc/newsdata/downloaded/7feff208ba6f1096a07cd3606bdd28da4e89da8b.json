Stability is essential for Portugal\u2019s international credibility and for attracting investors. We will strive to find solutions that ensure this stability for the entire legislature.\u201d\n\nThe Left Bloc, which held the 19 parliamentary seats it won four years ago, and the unreconstructed Portuguese Communist party, which won 12 seats, five fewer than in the last vote, said they were prepared to back the Socialists again \u2013 but laid down demands for wage increases, greater public spending and improved labour laws.\n\nAlternatively, Costa could seek a tie-up with the People-Animals-Nature party, which rode a wave of increasing environmental concern to capture four seats, and Free, an eco-socialist breakaway from the Left Bloc, which elected a single MP.\n\n\u201cThese negotiations could be more complex than four years ago when the pact on the left was cemented by their common goal to unseat the right,\u201d said one political scientist, Ant\u00f3nio Costa Pinto, who predicted government negotiations could take several weeks and involve more participants.\n\nA strengthened Socialist party has, in any event, a wider array of options to get laws approved in parliament, the political analyst Pedro Norton told the public broadcaster RTP. \u201cThis is an incentive for it to govern alone, by seeking ad hoc agreements\u201d for specific votes rather than sealing a formal alliance, he said.\n\nThe result reinforces something of a recent upturn for Europe\u2019s centre-left. After Sweden\u2019s Social Democrats managed to remain the country\u2019s largest party last year and \u2013 a greater challenge \u2013 to form a government afterwards, the centre-left came first in Finnish elections for the first time in 20 years.\n\nVoters returned the third left-leaning government in a year to the Nordic region as Denmark\u2019s Social Democrats claimed victory in parliamentary elections in June, while in Italy the Democratic party finds itself unexpectedly back in government after a strategic blunder by the leader of the far-right League, Matteo Salvini.\n\nEuropean Socialists were quick to celebrate. \u201cPortuguese society again chooses stability, equality and social justice,\u201d said Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the Spanish prime minister. \u201cWith the victory of the Socialist party, they are betting on a project of the left, progressives and modernisers. Let\u2019s continue working together for a fairer Europe.\u201d\n\nCelebrations were tempered, however, by the election in a country long thought immune to the rise of Europe\u2019s far right of an MP from a new nationalist formation, Chega! or Enough! \u2013 the first time a far-right party has won a seat in Portugal\u2019s parliament since the end of the Salazar dictatorship in 1974.\n\nAfter finishing second in the 2015 election and cobbling together his geringon\u00e7a, Costa reversed unpopular austerity measures, including cuts to public sector wages and pensions, introduced by the previous PSD-led government while still managing to bring Portugal\u2019s budget deficit down to nearly zero.\n\nHe has won praise at home and in Brussels for combining fiscal discipline with successful measures to stimulate the economy, which is growing faster than the EU average helped by rising exports and a booming tourism industry that attracted more tourists to Portugal last year than it has inhabitants.\n\nPolls had suggested Costa might win an absolute majority, allowing the Socialists to govern alone, but his lead was eroded by a series of scandals, including the former Socialist defence minister, Jos\u00e9 Azeredo Lopes, being charged with abuse of power and denial of justice over his role in the alleged cover-up of a 2017 arms theft.", "description": "Socialists now have incentive to govern alone rather than seeking formal alliance", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5395511abd22b227d05a5f5a64c1a507a64815da/0_53_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e88128b7c5ff1f1996dfa84facc45226", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
