He also had powerful enemies and ties to organized crime.\n\nGoldsmith is also O'Brien's stepson.\n\nBettmann Archive via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe conventional wisdom was that O\u2019Brien picked up Hoffa from the parking lot of the Machus Red Fox restaurant in Michigan on July 30, 1975, and drove him to his death, Goldsmith told Detroit ABC affiliate WXYZ in an interview Monday, a day before the book's release.\n\n\"There were good reasons for the FBI to suspect [O\u2019Brien]. He had recently had a break with Hoffa, he was in the vicinity of the Machus Red Fox the morning of the disappearance, and the afternoon of the disappearance,\" Goldsmith told WXYZ.\n\nThe LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images, FILE\n\n\"The last known time, when Hoffa was thought to be alive, did not leave enough time given the other things we know about Chuckie's whereabouts,\" he added, citing unnamed agents who worked on the case.\n\nGoldsmith said federal agents assigned to the case know who the real killer is, but won't reveal the person's name due to embarrassment over accusing the wrong man.\n\n\"They just didn\u2019t want to take the political heat, admitting they had basically accused the wrong person -- or let linger the accusations against Chuckie for 40 years,\" Goldsmith said.\n\nThe author did hint at who he has been told the real killer is, saying, \"That person I learned was a low-level member of the Detroit family in the 1970s who rose to prominence and is no longer alive. Beyond that I\u2019m not going to say anything else.\"\n\nBettmann Archive via Getty Images, FILE\n\nPeriodic searches for Hoffa's body have always turned up empty, including one in a Detroit lumberyard in 2009; a Roseville, Michigan, driveway in 2012; and a farm in Oakland Township, Michigan, in 2013.\n\nA new film about Hoffa's death and disappearance, \"The Irishman,\" written and directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Al Pacino as the labor leader, premieres at the New York Film Festival this week and will be released on Netflix in November. Robert De Niro stars as Frank Sheeran, the titular character, who reflects on his role in Hoffa's murder. The real Sheeran died in 2003.", "description": "Goldsmith, who is O\u2019Brien's stepson, said federal agents assigned to the case know who the real killer is.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/jimmy-hoffa-gty-jc-190923_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
