REUTERS/Jung Yeon-Je/Pool\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea\u2019s prime minister plans to visit Japan next week in what would be the highest-level trip since Japan imposed export curbs in a deepening trade and diplomatic row, officials said on Sunday.\n\nLee Nak-yon, whose trip is scheduled for Oct. 22-24, will attend Japanese Emperor Naruhito\u2019s enthronement ceremony, Lee\u2019s office said in a statement.\n\nLee is expected to take part in a banquet hosted by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday, and hold separate talks with him, which would mark the highest-level dialogue since tension flared up last year over the issue of Japan\u2019s wartime use of South Korean forced labour, officials said.\n\n\u201cWe hope his visit would help, as both sides share understanding that we continue dialogue to improve relations,\u201d a government official said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the ties.\n\nRelations between the neighbours are arguably at their lowest ebb since they normalised ties in 1965, after South Korea\u2019s Supreme Court last year ordered two Japanese companies to compensate some wartime labourers.\n\nJapan says the issue was settled under a 1965 treaty that normalised ties.\n\nThe dispute has since spilled over into trade and security, with Japan slapping export curbs and South Korea scrapping a bilateral intelligence-sharing pact.\n\nAbe and Lee, a former journalist with a stint as Japan correspondent, have built a rapport since their days as politicians and last met during an international forum in Russia in September 2018.", "description": "South Korea's prime minister plans to visit Japan next week in what would be the highest-level trip since Japan imposed export curbs in a deepening trade and diplomatic row, officials said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Hyonhee Shin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440262092&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C04Z", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
