(Mike Blake/Reuters)\n\nFocusing on a damn cartoon as being the thing that needs addressing on behalf of these people seems like it actually minimizes the real atrocities they faced.\n\nAccording to a University of Washington professor, the children\u2019s cartoon SpongeBob Squarepants is actually \u201cinfuse[d] . . . with racist, violent colonial practices.\u201d\n\nIn a piece for The Contemporary Pacific: A Journal of Island Affairs \u2014 titled \u201cUnsettling SpongeBob and the Legacies of Violence on Bikini Bottom\u201d\u2014 Holly Barker claims that the fictional land of \u201cBikini Bottom\u201d depicted in the cartoon is actually \u201cappropriation of\u201d the very real Bikini Atoll, which is a Marshall Islands coral reef that the U.S. military used for nuclear testing during the Cold War, displacing the indigenous people who lived there in order to do so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a piece in Campus Reform, Barker is basically upset that the fictional characters of Spongebob Squarepants (like a talking sponge named Spongebob and starfish named Patrick who wears boardshorts) were able to \u201coccupy\u201d the Bikini Bottom area whereas the indigenous people of Bikini Atoll do not.\n\n\u201cAlthough the U.S. government removed the people of Bikini from the atoll above the surface, this does not give license to SpongeBob or anyone else, fictitious or otherwise, to occupy Bikini,\u201d Barker stated.\n\n\u201cSpongeBob\u2019s presence on Bikini Bottom continues the violent and racist expulsion of Indigenous peoples from their lands (and in this case their cosmos) that enables U.S. hegemonic powers to extend their military and colonial interests in the postwar era,\u201d she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCampus Reform reports that Barker also takes issue with the fact that \u201call of the main characters on the show are male.\u201d She writes:\n\n\u201cThe name \u2018Bob\u2019 represents the everyday man, a common American male, much like a \u2018Joe,\u2019\u201d Barker observes, concluding that \u201cour gaze into the world of Bikini Bottom, as well as the surface of Bikini, is thus filtered through the activities of men.\u201d\n\nNow, I must admit that I am completely ignorant when it comes to whether or not \u201cBikini Bottom\u201d was actually based on Bikini Atoll. Campus Reform states that Barker herself believes that the show\u2019s creators probably didn\u2019t mean \u201cto infuse a children\u2019s show with racist, violent colonial practices\u201d \u2014 which, honestly, makes her decision to write an entire academic article on it anyway especially interesting \u2014 but I did some research and found that Barker was actually not the first person to make this claim. First, I found similar claims made in a June 2018 piece in The Conversation. Then, I saw a Huffington Post interview with Tom Kenny (the voice of Spongebob himself!) in which he actually states that \u201cBikini Bottom is kind of named after Bikini Atoll.\u201d I\u2019m not sure what \u201ckind of named after\u201d means exactly, but it\u2019s still enough for me to concede that there very likely is truth to the idea that that one may have been influenced by the other.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, though: Before I saw the Campus Reform article, I had absolutely never considered it myself, and I don\u2019t think that I\u2019m alone in that. Rather, I\u2019d guess that most of the people who, like me, grew up watching the talking, cackling sponge had never thought of it, either. Which is why I was confused by Barker\u2019s claim that the show actually \u201cshapes global perceptions of the actual place called Bikini.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe cartoon desensitizes viewers to the violence of settler colonialism, normalizes and erases the Bikinian people from their ancestral land, and whitewashes US military rampages on the islands in the history and narratives of Bikini.\u201d\n\nMy question? Just how in the hell could all of this actually happen because of the show\u2019s connection to Bikini Atoll, when pretty much no one actually even recognized that connection (if it does exist) in the first place?\n\nShort answer? It can\u2019t.\n\nMake no mistake: What happened on Bikini Atoll was horrific. The United States threw people out of their homeland so we could nuke the hell out of it more than 20 times. That is completely something to be upset about; I will never argue otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe thing is, though, I actually think that the worst way to communicate that horror is by making sweeping, illogical claims about the impact of a Nickelodeon cartoon. If anything, focusing on a damn cartoon as being the thing that needs addressing on behalf of these people seems like it actually minimizes the very real atrocities that they have faced. I mean, why spend all of that time shaming a cartoon, when you could be shaming the U.S. government? Why accuse a cartoon of some very dubious transgressions (like shaping \u201cglobal perceptions\u201d) when you could be accusing the U.S. government of credible ones? If anything, it makes the issue look like a joke. After all, when you go too far with accusations, it often makes people hesitant to listen to you talk about the issue at all.", "description": "Focusing on a damn cartoon as being the thing that needs addressing on behalf of these people seems like it actually minimizes the real atrocities they faced.", "authors": ["Katherine Timpf", "John Mccormack", "John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
