He\u2019s also renowned for his wife\u2019s name, Eve; Adam and Eve are teased for their failure to name their kids Cain and Abel.\n\nCharles Glovsky, Schiff\u2019s cousin, told me that friends are always advising Schiff to buy nicer suits or less decrepit shoes, but that he isn\u2019t interested. \u201cNot motivated by money at all,\u201d Glovsky said.\n\nThese days, Schiff said, he\u2019s trying to proceed as fast as possible with the impeachment investigation, but he resisted my attempts to pin him to a timeline. \u201cWhen you consider how much we have learned in the last three weeks, it\u2019s breathtaking,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying.\u201d\n\nHe said that his committee is investigating whether there is a recording of the call between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president, either in the U.S. or in Ukraine. \u201cWe are determined to find out,\u201d he said.\n\nSchiff was particularly scathing about Attorney General William Barr. \u201cHe\u2019s the second most dangerous person in the country,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cIn his own way, he\u2019s as much of a threat to the rule of law as the president.\u201d\n\nI asked if the House might, in a bid to compel testimony, exercise its \u201cinherent contempt\u201d authority and send the sergeant-at-arms out to arrest people and lock them up in the Capitol. Schiff said he had ruled this out but was considering fining those who refuse to cooperate.\n\nHe acknowledged some missteps, including misleading comments about his committee\u2019s contact with the whistle-blower. I argued that we might be better off if hearings were public; he responded that initial hearings need to be closed to keep witnesses from knowing what others have said, but he added that \u201call these transcripts are going to be made public.\u201d", "description": "Relentless, yes.
