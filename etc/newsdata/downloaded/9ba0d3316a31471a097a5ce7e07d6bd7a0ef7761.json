Meanwhile, the income gap grew wider in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Kansas, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Texas and Virginia.\n\nEconomists measure income inequality using the Gini Index, which examines the distance between the country\u2019s top and bottom incomes. The index works on a scale of 0 to 1; a score of \u201c0\u201d indicates perfect equality, while a score of \u201c1\u201d indicates perfect inequality, where one household has all the income.\n\nAccording to the survey, from 2017 to 2018 the Gini Index grew from 0.482 to 0.485, a statistically significant jump. Over the past five decades, the index has been rising steadily.\n\nThe 2020 presidential election has put the contentious issue increasingly in the spotlight.\n\nEarlier this month, when Census officials revealed that median household incomes had reached $62,000, the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers praised Trump administration economic policies for helping \u201cthose typically left behind\u201d and increasing wages for \u201clower-income families.\u201d\n\nTwo leading Democratic presidential candidates \u2014 Sens. Bernard Sanders, Vermont independent, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2014 have disagreed. They are proposing to create a \u201cwealth tax\u201d for the nation\u2019s richest citizens as a way to reduce wealth disparities.\n\n\u201cWhile the Census Bureau report shows a welcome increase last year in median family income,\u201d Mr. Sanders said earlier this month, \u201cthe fact is that household incomes still are 1.6% below the 2007 level, the year before the last recession began. The wealthy, meanwhile, have never had it so good.\u201d\n\nIncome inequity factors heavily in the nation\u2019s current rural-urban and red state-blue state schism between conservatives and liberals, pollsters say.\n\nMr. Longworth, author of the 2007 book \u201cCaught in the Middle: America\u2019s Heartland in the Age of Globalism,\u201d told The Washington Times that rural America wrestles with the \u201ceconomic anxiety narrative\u201d which in turn contributes to social segregation across the country.\n\nKey factors of inequality include flattened incomes, reduced employment opportunities and deteriorating housing stock, experts say.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the nation\u2019s wealthiest citizens have seen the value of their stocks, properties and other assets increase dramatically since the great recession in 2008, demographic experts say.\n\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
