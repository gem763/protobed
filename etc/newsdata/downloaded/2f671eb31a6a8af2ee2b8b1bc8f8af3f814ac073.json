In the case of Survation, 33% want MPs to approve what has been agreed, while 25% say they should not.\n\nThat said, voters are not necessarily convinced the agreement would be good for the country.\n\nAccording to YouGov, slightly more (23%) believe it would be a bad deal for Britain than think it would be a good one (17%). As many as 45% feel they do not know enough to give a view either way.\n\nSimilarly, Survation reports while 25% think it would be good for Britain as a whole, 27% believe it would be bad. And just 17% believe the UK would benefit most from the deal, while 28% think the EU would.\n\nIt may be some voters feel the agreement is the best that can be achieved in the circumstances.\n\nEither way, so far at least, it is difficult for either the government or the opposition parties to argue most voters clearly back their point of view on the deal.\n\nDo voters prefer Boris Johnson's or Theresa May's deal?\n\nThe agreement Mrs May struck in November 2018 received a decidedly frosty reception from voters.\n\nFor example, when Survation asked voters whether they supported or opposed what she had brought back from Brussels, just 16% said they backed it. Nearly twice as many (30%) were opposed.\n\nAlthough the balance of opinion on this measure did become somewhat more favourable thereafter, it never tilted decisively in favour of Mrs May.\n\nIn response to exactly the same question, 31% support Mr Johnson's deal while only 25% are opposed.\n\nMore like this\n\nMeanwhile, when YouGov first asked how MPs should vote on Theresa May's deal, just 27% said they should approve it. At that time, 42% indicated they should reject it, figures that never changed dramatically.\n\nThe equivalent figures for Mr Johnson's deal are almost the mirror image of these.\n\nIt was always difficult for Mrs May to argue with MPs that voters were keen for them to back her deal.\n\nOn this score, at least, Mr Johnson appears to have a better case.\n\nSupport for Boris Johnson's deal among Leave and Remain supporters\n\nLeave and Remain voters have very different views.\n\nBoth those who voted Leave and those who backed Remain in 2016 were unhappy with what Mrs May had brought back from Brussels.\n\nNow, it looks as though at least half of those who voted Leave in 2016 - and maybe more - support the prime minister's deal.\n\nBut, conversely, about half of those who voted Remain are opposed to the deal.\n\nVoters have also been asked what they would do if a referendum offered a choice between leaving the EU on the terms proposed by Mr Johnson or remaining in the EU.\n\nTheir responses reinforce the impression Mr Johnson's deal has divided the country.\n\nBoth Opinium and Survation have suggested the outcome of such a ballot would be a tie.\n\nMany Remain supporters appear to believe if Mr Johnson's deal were to be put to a confirmatory vote, a majority would vote to stay in the EU.\n\nHowever, it seems such an outcome is by no means guaranteed.\n\nBut, equally, the deal does not appear to provide a promising foundation for bringing the country together, as the prime minister argues it would.\n\nSo far, at least, he has won over too few Remain voters for that to be the case.\n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\n\nFurther details of the research on which it is based are available here.\n\nSir John Curtice is professor of politics, Strathclyde University, and senior research fellow at NatCen Social Research and The UK in a Changing Europe.\n\nEdited by Duncan Walker", "description": "How voters want MPs to approach Boris Johnson's deal on the UK's departure from the EU.", "authors": ["Sir John Curtice", "Professor Of Politics At Strathclyde University"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E36D/production/_109312285_big_ben_crop.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
