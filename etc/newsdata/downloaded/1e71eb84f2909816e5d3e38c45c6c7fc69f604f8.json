The company said it expects adjusted full-year earnings per share between $1.15 and $1.30. That range is well below the $1.49 per share Wall Street had projected, according to a Refinitiv consensus estimate. For the second quarter, the gaming retailer reported an adjusted loss per share of 32 cents and revenue of $1.29 billion. Wall Street expected an adjusted loss of 21 cents a share and $1.34 billion in revenue, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates.\n\nZscaler shares plunged nearly 20% following weak earnings guidance and a fourth-quarter earnings miss. The company posted an adjusted loss of 7 cents per share compared to expected profit of 1 cent per share. Revenue, however, came in better than expected at $86.1 million, compared with the $82.8 million forecast by analysts polled by Refinitiv.\n\nShares of RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, jumped as much as 6% after posting better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenue. The home-furnishing company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.20 and $707 million in revenue. Analysts had expected earnings of $2.70 a share and $698 million in revenue, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates. The company also raised its third-quarter forecast, saying it now expects adjusted earnings per share between $2.08 and $2.18. Wall Street had projected third-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.82 per share, according to a Refinitiv consensus estimate.\n\nThe stock later lost those gains and was last seen trading about 3% below its closing price. As of their Tuesday close, RH shares have gained more than 32% so far this year.\n\nDave and Buster's shares plunged 13% after the company lowered its outlook \"in light of a competitive environment\" and reported weaker-than-expected same-store sales. The company said comparable store sales declined 1.8% during the second quarter, compared with the 0.5% decline expected by analysts polled by Refinitiv. That news overshadowed earnings and revenue that topped expectations.
