They began with remarkable speed, bring carriers from deep with little deception but relying on their physical runners to get over the gainline, and supporting with two or three clearout men in close proximity to ensure quick ruck ball. For a while, it worked, with Samu Kerevi and a roaming Marika Koroibete prominent, with Jordan Petaia pushed out to cover the latter on the left and also showing promise with a couple of charges.\n\nEngland struggled to reset between phases, leaving softer shoulders around the corner and allowing Will Genia to put his bigger forwards into small spaces.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They are not a naturally effervescent side, particularly in the pack, and don\u2019t look hugely comfortable working offloads and tip-on passes in tighter confines.\n\nAnd yet such was their desire to play with pace, intent and intensity and put themselves on the front foot that they tried to play in that manner. Australia\u2019s tight five and back row can offload \u2013 it is a non-negotiable in rugby, now \u2013 but their spatial awareness and understanding of support and timing is not as good as, say, that of New Zealand, or Fiji, or even this England side.\n\nThe Australians\u2019 exits were consistently poor, too. Attempts to play from deep were not necessarily ill-conceived, with England under-resourcing their forward line at times and leaving space down the flanks, but they were ill-executed. Short passes failed to find hands, offloads put others under pressure rather than open gaps, and the kicks, when they did eventually come, were often hurried and, thus, poor.\n\nThis all contributed to a swing in momentum. Australia, realistically, needed a first quarter lead of ten to fifteen points to assert their early ascendancy \u2013 they got three, and that came from Kurtley Beale\u2019s brilliance in the open field.\n\nEngland\u2019s first try highlighted why Jones opted to drop George Ford and bring back Henry Slade.\n\nOff first phase Manu Tuilagi was released on a crash ball, pinning in the inside Australia defence with a charge up the middle. Quick, efficient service from the base from Ben Youngs brought the rest of the England backs into the space Tuilagi\u2019s charge created, with Henry Slade utilised as a first receiver.\n\nSlade is a deceptively large man, and commands attention as a runner. But he is more a footballer, and superb at taking the ball to the line and timing his pass to bring others in. Here, he pulled back a pass for Owen Farrell, who swiftly got the ball on to Elliot Daly, who in turn slapped on to Anthony Watson. England were beyond the Australia defence, and into the 22.\n\nFrom there the pressure told, with Australia unable to regather and reassemble defensively. Owen Farrell was whipped the ball with Australia actually numbered up well on the right, but a soft overlap was created by the identity of the defenders there \u2013 Reece Hodge, the last man in the line, had tight five forwards inside him in Izack Rodda and Allan Alaalatoa.\n\nFarrell hit Tom Curry in stride to get to the outside of the pair and leave Hodge isolated, and a simple draw and pass put May in.\n\nThere is a school of thought that having your second distributor at 13 is more dangerous. With Tuilagi setting lines and holding defenders, the ball can be worked wider more quickly, while Slade\u2019s versatility throughout the midfield allows England to work different formations off set piece and in phase play.\n\nAgainst Australia, this was particularly effective. Jones could not have predicted Jordan Petaia starting in that 13 channel, but it had been the weak point of the Wallabies\u2019 defence regardless, with James O\u2019Connor\u2019s versatility perhaps hurting his natural nous for defending that corridor. Petaia has played little high-level rugby at outside centre, and while he has the potential to become one of the very best at the position, and innate understanding of how to defend in that region that bodes well for his future, he is inexperienced, and England found joy attacking him.\n\nWith the inside defence loaded up to combat Tuilagi\u2019s threat, and thus Kerevi and Christian Lealiifano so focused on the inside centre, Petaia was left a little exposed, with Slade excellent throughout.\n\nEngland\u2019s second try was a score of Australia\u2019s making.\n\nThe other con of playing such an attacking game is how fatiguing it can be. Australia asked their side to work incredibly hard in attack, sending heavy resources into each ruck and requesting two or three ruck involvements from each player in quick succession. With fatigue comes poor decisions, and into the game came England.\n\nNowhere was this more evident than May\u2019s second score. Maro Itoje disrupts a breakdown, stepping away to invite a player to dive off their feet, and then attacking the two tiring shields and forcing a slow pass from Will Genia.\n\nDavid Pocock takes it but the support coming from the inside is slow, with Rory Arnold ambling and Alaalatoa struggling, too. With Slade, Tom Curry and Manu Tuilagi closing in, Pocock has to force a short offload to Christian Lealliifano in an attempt to keep the movement going.\n\nLealiifano is not anticipating the pass, instead focused on the task of clearing the contact area when Pocock is chopped down, something he, as the team\u2019s fly-half and primary distributor, should not really have to. Pocock\u2019s offload flashes past Lealiifano\u2019s hands, and Slade gathers with green grass in which to run.\n\nA magnificent prod through from Slade, off his wrong foot, and May raced away for his second score, diving over exactly three minutes after scoring his first.\n\nThe game had been turned in 180 seconds.", "description": "One wonders what might have happened had Australia\u00a0managed to convert their early advantage into points.
