In reality, they abducted Mr. Bean on holiday,\" Whelan told the court Thursday, according to the BBC.\n\nWhelan, who has U.S., Irish, Canadian and British citizenship, was arrested while in Russia for a friend\u2019s wedding last December on charges that he had received state secrets.\n\nHe denied the accusations and told the court he believed his arrest qualified as a \u201chostage situation,\" the BBC said.\n\nWhelan told AFP it's possible he's being held as a pawn in a potential prisoner swap between the U.S. and Russia. The Russian Foreign Ministry denied such claims.\n\nWhelan said the Russian government could also be retaliating for sanctions levied against Russia after its interference in the 2016 election.\n\nWhelan has repeatedly claimed he has been assaulted in jail and he believes his life is in danger there. He\u2019s asked for a new judge and prosecutor on the case.\n\n\u201cEvidence that I provided has been ignored. Questions of law are always decided in favor of the prosecutors and the FSB [security service],\u201d Whelan told the judge, per the BBC.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a resolution calling on the Russian government to provide evidence of wrongdoing or else release Whelan from prison. Rep. Haley Stevens, D.-Mich., introduced the resolution.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly asked the Russian government to provide Paul with a fair and transparent judicial process to no avail,\u201d Stevens said, according to The Hill. \"The State Department has been unwavering in their work on Paul's behalf, especially [former] Ambassador [Jon] Huntsman. The Russian government has not provided timely updates about Paul's case.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhelan, the head of global security for a Michigan-based auto parts supplier, has said he was in Moscow to attend the wedding of a friend from the Marine Corps.\n\nWhelan said someone whom he considered a friend handed him a USB stick he believed contained vacation photos. Five minutes later, authorities stormed his hotel and arrested him -- the USB stick reportedly contained a list of names of those working at a classified security agency.\n\nIf convicted, Whelan faces up to 20 years in prison for espionage.\n\nHowever, with the investigation completed, Whelan\u2019s legal team believes they have \"lots in their favor\u201d in the files they\u2019ve been given. Only the supposed \u201cfriend\u201d of Whelan who handed him the flash drive testified against him.\n\nThe rest of Whelan\u2019s Russian friends testified that they did not believe him to be a spy. The man testifying against Whelan \u201cwas a provocateur,\u201d Whelan\u2019s lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, said.", "description": "Paul Whelan likened himself moreso to the dopey buffoon that is the character Mr. Bean than the cunning spy character that is James Bond.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/4b7e5fe5-1000-1.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
