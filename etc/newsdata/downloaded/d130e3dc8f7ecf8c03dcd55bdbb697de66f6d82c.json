She brought down the house at New York Fashion Week with a sexy show for her lingerie line, Savage. But now, she\u2019s turning to workwear for her luxury brand, Fenty. The collection explores women\u2019s power and \u201cexamines the workplace as a concept and the ascent of women within it,\u201d per a release.\n\nBut lest you think that means Rihanna is churning out skirt suits, the campaign suggests otherwise. At least in the photo provided to the Cut this morning, the model wears pointy, lace-up boots, a dark-green anorak with orange lining, and some kind of pink dress. Not exactly Working Girl, and definitely cooler. To capture this collection, Fenty enlisted photographer Sharna Osborne to shoot the campaign, with creative direction by Joshua Glass and Jahleel Weaver. Everything else \u2014 the collection, the campaign \u2014 drops tomorrow, September 26 on the Fenty website.", "description": "The collection explores women\u2019s power and \u201cexamines the workplace as a concept and the ascent of women within it,\u201d per a release.", "authors": ["Sarah Spellings"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/25/LOUD_FENTY_SHARNA_OSBORNE_088_1080x1080.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
