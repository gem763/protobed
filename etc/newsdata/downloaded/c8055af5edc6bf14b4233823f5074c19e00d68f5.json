The Aug. 27 wreck left 19-year-old Harry Dunn dead after the woman allegedly collided with Dunn\u2019s motorcycle near the Royal Air Force Croughton station, which is operated by the U.S. Air Force.\n\nOffering his sympathies to the family for their \u201ctragic loss,\u201d British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday that he hoped the woman, who has been identified as 42-year-old Anne Sacoolas, would return to Britain to face justice.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Johnson said: \u201cI hope that Anne Sacoolas will come back and will engage properly with the processes of law as they are carried out in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t resolve it, then of course I will be raising it myself personally with the White House,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe tragedy sparked widespread outrage after authorities revealed that Sacoolas claimed diplomatic immunity under international law, allowing her to avoid prosecution and leaving British authorities and Dunn\u2019s loved ones to demand that she return to face the consequences of her actions.\n\nIn an emotional plea on Saturday, Dunn\u2019s parents begged President Trump to intervene and to send Sacoolas back to Britain.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump, please listen,\u201d Dunn\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, said in an interview with Sky News. \u201cWe\u2019re a family in ruin. We\u2019re broken. We can\u2019t grieve. Please, please, let her get back on a plane, come back to the U.K. . . . We could understand how she\u2019s feeling, but more importantly, she needs to face justice, see what she\u2019s done.\"\n\nUnder the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, family members of diplomats living in other countries are covered by immunity, allowing them to avoid arrest for virtually any crime and escape civil liability in most circumstances. However, the diplomat\u2019s home country can also choose to waive immunity \u2014 and that\u2019s what British authorities and Dunn\u2019s loved ones are calling for in this case.\n\nNick Adderley, chief constable for the Northamptonshire Police, said Sunday that both he and the police chief have asked the U.S. Embassy \u201cin the strongest terms\u201d to waive the woman\u2019s immunity \u201cin order to allow the justice process to take place.\u201d\n\nThe short answer is yes. Both @Stephen_Mold and I have written, in the strongest terms, to the US Embassy urging them to apply the diplomatic immunity waiver in order to allow the justice process to take place. https://t.co/OKmRXLhJhO \u2014 Nick Adderley (@NorthantsChief) October 6, 2019\n\nIn a statement Sunday to The Washington Post, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that he \u201ccalled the U.S. ambassador to express the U.K.\u2019s disappointment with their decision, and to urge the embassy to reconsider it.\u201d\n\nThe State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Sunday, but it previously told multiple media outlets that immunity is \u201crarely waived.\u201d Officials offered their \u201cdeepest sympathies\u201d to Dunn\u2019s family, confirming that the diplomat\u2019s family is back in the United States.\n\n\u201cAny questions regarding a waiver of immunity with regard to our diplomats and their family members overseas in a case like this receive intense attention at senior levels and are considered carefully given the global impact such decisions carry,\u201d the State Department\u2019s statement said.\n\nFollowing the revelation Saturday that Sacoolas had fled, Dunn\u2019s parents launched a #Justice4Harry campaign that has since drawn the attention of British lawmakers and thousands of supporters. Charles told Sky News that there was \u201cbarely a day that went by where [Harry] didn\u2019t go out riding on his bike,\u201d racking up 50,000 miles of travel on his black Kawasaki.\n\nA fundraising page that was created to help the family with their quest for justice has attracted hundreds of donations, with more than 6,000 pounds ($7,300) raised so far. \u201cHarry\u2019s loss has left an enormous hole in the lives of the family and they are understandably going through a shattering and life changing time,\u201d the page reads.\n\nDunn\u2019s family said he was hit around 8:30 p.m. about 400 yards from the Air Force facility. The collision happened after he rounded a bend, leaving him little time to react to the American driver coming on the wrong side of the road. Dunn sustained serious injuries, then died at a hospital, Northamptonshire Police said at the time of the collision.\n\nDuring the investigation, the American woman cooperated \u201cfully\u201d with police, and even assured them \u201cshe had no plans to leave the country in the near future,\u201d Northamptonshire Police Superintendent Sarah Johnson said in a statement Saturday.\n\nBut then police learned the driver would be claiming diplomatic immunity, and they made an immediate waiver request to the U.S. Embassy in London, a spokeswoman told The Post. That request was denied, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disgusted, appalled, how she could be having this cloak wrapped around her,\u201d Dunn\u2019s father, Tim Dunn, told Sky News. \u201cI\u2019m angry that someone could do this and then get on a plane and go.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s living with herself,\u201d he added.\n\nAmerican diplomats have been involved in numerous overseas deaths in recent decades, but they have largely avoided punishment under diplomatic immunity, even amid tense pressure from the countries where those incidents took place.\n\nIn 2018, a military attache at the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, Col. Joseph Emanuel Hall, ran a red light and killed a 22-year-old man on a motorcycle. Hall left Pakistan after U.S. authorities refused to waive his diplomatic immunity.\n\nIn an infamous case that also took place in Pakistan, Raymond A. Davis, a CIA contractor working in Lahore, claimed he shot and killed two men on motorcycles in self-defense as they approached him in an apparent robbery attempt in 2011. The two nations disagreed on whether Davis could be granted diplomatic immunity \u2014 and so Pakistan released him from jail only after as much as $2.3 million in \u201cblood money\u201d was paid to the families of the dead men, sparking protests.\n\nBut even if diplomats flee prosecution in other countries, that does not mean they cannot face consequences in the United States.\n\nFor example, Christopher VanGoethem, a U.S. Marine heading security at the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest, allegedly drove through a stop sign and smashed into a taxicab in 2004 \u2014 killing a beloved musician named Teofil Peter, who had been likened to a \u201cRomanian Bruce Springsteen,\u201d Newsweek reported. Again, the U.S. government did not waive immunity, but the Marine faced a court-martial upon his return to the United States.\n\nThe consequences were few. In 2006, he was acquitted of negligent homicide, as well as adultery for an alleged affair with an embassy secretary. But he was found guilty of obstruction and making false statements. VanGoethem was sentenced to a letter of reprimand, avoiding up to 10 years in prison.\n\nSome foreign diplomats living in the United States have not been so lucky.\n\nIn 1997, when Georgian diplomat Gueorgui Makharadze slammed his Ford Taurus into a row of cars at a stoplight in Washington\u2019s Dupont Circle and killed a teenage girl, the United States asked Georgia to waive immunity, which the country did. Makharadze was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to seven to 21 years in prison.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether pressure from British lawmakers will sway U.S. officials after they have already facilitated the 42-year-old woman\u2019s return to the country and shielded her identity.\n\nAngela Rayner, a member of Parliament and the Labour Party\u2019s shadow education secretary, said on Twitter that \u201cdiplomatic rules should not be used in this case.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is heartbreaking and nobody can be above the law,\u201d Rayner wrote, using the #Justice4Harry hashtag. \u201cIf you are here in the U.K. then you must abide by our own rules. This family deserve answers and respect shown to their son.\u201d\n\nThis is heartbreaking and nobody can be above the law. If you are here in the U.K. then you must abide by our rules. This family deserve answers and respect shown to their son. #Justice4harry https://t.co/FyhzQMcdBR \u2014 Angela Rayner \ud83c\udf08 (@AngelaRayner) October 5, 2019\n\nFlynn reported from Washington.", "description": "U.S. authorities have rejected British authorities' requests to waive immunity, police say.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hassan", "Social Media Editor For The Foreign Desk", "Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter", "October At Am", "Jennifer Hassan Is The Social Media Editor For The Foreign Desk At The Washington Post.
