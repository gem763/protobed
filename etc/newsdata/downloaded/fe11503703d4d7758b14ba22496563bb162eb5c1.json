Democrats have recently sought to impose the state\u2019s online privacy, auto emissions and corporate-diversity diktats nationwide. Businesses have no choice but to abide by the rules California makes if they want to reach the state\u2019s 39 million residents. Applying those rules nationally makes sense for companies that want to avoid market fragmentation.\n\nNow state lawmakers are trying to force the National Collegiate Athletic Association to do the same. Last week the Legislature in Sacramento unanimously passed the Fair Pay to Play Act, which would require large public and private universities in the state to let student athletes accept compensation for use of their names, likenesses and images.\n\nThis would violate the NCAA\u2019s bylaws, yet the bill forbids the organization from punishing colleges and athletes that break its rules. Letting California\u2019s college athletes pocket endorsement money would put colleges in other states at a competitive disadvantage, so the NCAA would be under pressure to drop its longstanding pay-for-play prohibition.\n\nThat\u2019s what the bill\u2019s supporters are hoping for. Los Angeles Lakers megastar LeBron James, who skirted prohibitions on amateurs accepting gifts as a high-school player and then skipped college, has tweeted an endorsement: \u201cCalifornia can change the game. This is only right waaaayy overdue.\u201d\n\nLetting college athletes cash in appeals both to the free-market right and the social-justice left. Why shouldn\u2019t student athletes get paid for their hard work and talents, which earn tens of millions of dollars for their coaches, colleges and the NCAA?\n\nLiberals view the NCAA as indentured servitude. Before talented football and basketball players can ink seven- or eight-figure contracts in the professional leagues, they first have to pay their dues by playing in the NCAA without remuneration beyond a scholarship covering tuition, room and board, and other educational expenses. Student athletes may forgo millions in potential earnings, and those who flame out in the pros have exhausted their best playing years with no money to show for their efforts. To the left, student athletes are an exploited class of workers.\n\nThis is one reason unions including the AFL-CIO, Afscme, United Steelworkers and Teamsters rank among the bill\u2019s top supporters. Unions also hope that chipping away at the NCAA\u2019s pay-for-play ban will lay the groundwork for turning student athletes into employees. That is to say, dues-paying members. Richard Griffin, who was general counsel to the National Labor Relations Board under President Obama, wrote a 2017 memo to the board\u2019s regional directors arguing that college football players should be treated as employees under federal labor law.\n\nMany conservatives also support the idea of compensating students athletes for their hard work. In their view, the NCAA and the colleges act like socialist governments that confiscate and redistribute student-athlete earnings to support unprofitable programs\u2014especially women\u2019s teams\u2014in the name of advancing equity.\n\nOne irony is that letting student athletes earn money from endorsements would increase inequality between men and women, which Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments Act was intended to remedy. Men\u2019s basketball and football players would score the biggest endorsements, which would no doubt trigger a push by the left to figure out a way to level the gender paying field.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s colleges have joined the NCAA in opposing the Fair Pay to Play Act. Stanford University points out the legislation is \u201cinconsistent with recent court rulings . . . that determined that all student-athlete benefits must be tied directly to education purposes only.\u201d\n\nThe legislation may also violate the Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from burdening interstate commerce. Nevada passed a law during the early 1990s requiring the NCAA to expand due process protections for its colleges. As in California, the Nevada law specifically forbade the NCAA to retaliate against compliant schools. Yet the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated the Nevada law because it would interfere with interstate commerce.\n\nIf every state can supersede the NCAA\u2019s rules, the organization would be rendered impotent and irrelevant. Imagine if North Carolina passed a law that said its student athletes don\u2019t have to meet the NCAA\u2019s academic qualifications. Or if Alabama were to require Crimson Tide football coach Nick Saban to pay players. Each state would try to enact laws to obtain a competitive advantage.\n\nThe California bill will surely get tied up in court and could stymie NCAA rule revisions. The NCAA earlier this year formed a working group to consider letting athletes profit from their names, images and likenesses while maintaining \u201cthe clear demarcation between professional and college sports.\u201d One idea is to let athletes set aside endorsement money in a trust they can tap after graduating.\n\nSo often politicians in Sacramento try to force their views and values on the rest of the country, but policies are more enduring when they are developed through a national public consensus. That\u2019s political science 101.\n\nMs. Finley is a member of the Journal\u2019s editorial board.", "description": "A union-backed law would sow Commerce Clause chaos and render the NCAA irrelevant.", "authors": ["Allysia Finley", "Allysia.Finley Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107261/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
