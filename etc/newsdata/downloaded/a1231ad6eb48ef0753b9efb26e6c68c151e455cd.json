And it found more than half of the schools with the harshest dress codes have a majority black student population.\n\nJasmine Tucker, the NWLC\u2019s director of research, said many schools\u2019 dress code policies target clothing most often worn by girls such as regulating tank top strap width.\n\nShe argued black girls face assumptions about \u201cwho they are and what they are like\u201d built on stereotypes \u2013 adding that many traditionally black hairstyles and head coverings, which often have specific cultural or religious meaning, are sometimes seen to be \u201cunprofessional\u201d.\n\n\u201cMany schools ban head wraps or other head coverings and specify that hair must be \u2018neat\u2019, which is another way of banning certain hairstyles,\u201d she told The Independent.\n\n\u201cNWLC spoke with many DC students who reported that black girls in their schools are being disproportionately targeted for violating dress code policies. This is unacceptable. Black girls deserve to bring their authentic selves to school and should not face unnecessary barriers to participating in the classroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany dress codes specify disciplinary action that will be taken if a student is violating dress code, and includes barring students from class and even in or out of school suspension. They are disproportionately punishing students by standing in the way of learning for what are minor infractions.\u201d\n\nMs Anderson noted high schools which are majority black tend to have more \u201cstringent and harsher\u201d student codes of conduct overall.\n\nRead more\n\nBlack women earn $1m less than white men over lifetime, study finds\n\n\u201cOften times it is black administrators carrying out harsh discipline policies because they believe it\u2019s necessary to prepare black students for a world that already views them as less innocent and more adult,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut in actuality, restrictive dress codes and discipline policies reinforce anti-black stereotypes by telling black girls that their authentic selves are incompatible with academic success. Black girls deserve teachers and school leaders that are willing to challenge systemic racism and misogyny that have created barriers for too many students for too long.\u201d\n\nMs Anderson added: \u201cAny adult sexualising girls\u2019 bodies by policing their clothing is problematic for students and results in negative academic, social, and emotional effects on students. Too often girls recounted stories about administrators implying that girls are inviting sexual harassment because of what they are wearing.\n\n\"Not only is this blaming the victim, it also communicates to boys or other harassers that they are not responsible for their own behaviour.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cboys will be boys attitude\u201d prioritises the \u201cdesires of harassers over the bodily autonomy\u201d of survivors, she added.", "description": "Black girls in the US are being disproportionately pushed out of school over racist and sexist school dress codes and subjected to victim blaming by teachers, a new report has found.Researchers at the National Women\u2019s Law Centre (NWLC) found around half of secondary schools banned hair wraps or other", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/guwfkC3VhjUg3HHvUWTxoQ--~B/aD0zODU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/46df7d0d8e8c7e455b4b0972e6878f1b", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
