Even before Photoshop existed in 1988, the magazine industry collaborated with celebrities to carefully present images that shape our consciousness.\n\nDigital editing takes that to another degree. Now, any celebrity can change their appearance in a photo with the swipe of a finger.\n\nFor many people, it's a serious problem. One major criticism lobbed at celebrities and magazines is that they promote unrealistic body standards - especially for women.\n\nCelebrities often post Photoshopped selfies. And, of course, altered images are common in advertising as well. Sometimes, though, the manipulation is obvious. And that leads fans, critics, and even celebrities themselves to sometimes react harshly.\n\nHere are 46 celebrity Photoshops that turned into disasters.\n\nAly Weisman contributed to a previous version of this article.\n\nLena Dunham was clearly missing something in this 2014 Vogue cover shoot.\n\nLena Dunham in a 2014 issue of Vogue.\n\nLike many things Lena Dunham does, it was controversial.\n\nHer arm mysteriously disappeared.\n\nShe's missing an arm.\n\nOther photos from the shoot were also heavily Photoshopped, but Dunham was OK with it. She told Slate that she saw the Photo shoot as a fantasy, not something that was supposed to emulate real life.\n\n\"Vogue isn't the place that we go to look at realistic women,\"she said. \"Vogue is the place that we go to look at beautiful clothes and fancy places and escapism and so I feel like if the story reflects me and I happen to be wearing a beautiful Prada dress and surrounded by beautiful men and dogs, what's the problem?\"\n\nZendaya was surprised to see her body look different in a 2015 shoot for Modeliste magazine.\n\nZendaya was shocked to find her body was altered. The magazine's version is on the left, the original on the right.\n\n\"Had a new shoot come out today and was shocked when I found my 19-year-old hips and torso quite manipulated,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"These are the things that make women self conscious, that create the unrealistic ideals of beauty that we have. Anyone who knows who I am knows I stand for honest and pure self love. So I took it upon myself to release the real pic (right side) and I love it.\"\n\nThe magazine blamed a third party editor and posted the original photo.\n\nModeliste published the original photo after blaming an editor for the modifications.\n\nThe magazine's editor blamed \"an independent editing company,\" pulled the issue, and restored the original photo for publication.\n\n\"Modeliste advocates positive body image, self love and the empowerment of women,\" Amy McCabe, the Editor in Chief, wrote in an open letter. \"We are all beautiful and unique in our own way, and it is through these differences that make us who we are as individuals.\"\n\nFans called out this Kylie Jenner selfie for Photoshop.\n\nOne of Jenner's many selfies.\n\nThe image seems to have a glaring issue.\n\nThe wall in the background appears to curve right around where her stomach bends in.\n\nFor what it's worth, Jenner took to Snapchat not long after to explain that it wasn't Photoshop, it's simply the way her curtain looks.\n\nIn 2016, Meghan Trainor posted a side-by-side image of what she looks like in real life and how she was made to appear in her \"Me Too\" music video.\n\nMeghan Trainor wasn't happy about her image in the video.\n\n\"They Photoshopped the crap out of me and I'm so sick of it, so I took it down until they fix it,\" she explained on Snapchat.\n\nIt was fixed within a day.\n\nMeghan Trainor in her 'Me Too' music video.\n\nAfter Trainor took the video down, she got the studio to release a version of the video without body manipulation.\n\nKaty Perry appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone in August 2010.\n\nKaty Perry on the cover of Rolling Stone.\n\nShe was interviewed at length about how she went from a singer in a church to a sex icon.\n\nPre-Photoshop photos appeared on Tumblr.\n\nThe unedited photo.\n\nRolling Stone drew criticism for making changes to her body . Perry's skin had been smoothed over, her thighs thinned, hand modified, and had several moles removed.\n\nVogue posted this photo of Miranda Kerr on Instagram after the 2012 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.\n\nMiranda Kerr and other Victoria's Secret angels\n\nBut when Kerr posted the same photo in November, fans noticed a huge difference.\n\nKerr's waistline in her Instagram post is noticeably smaller than it is in the original photo.\n\nTake a look at her hips compared with the first photo.\n\nShe claimed she pulled it off the internet and didn't know it was Photoshopped, but it's not the only photo she's posted with those issues\n\nAdam Levine appeared in the November 2011 issue of Vogue Russia with his then-girlfriend, model Anne Vyalitsyna.\n\nLevine and Vyalitsyna.\n\nSomething's not right.\n\nHe lost half his torso.\n\nSomething went seriously wrong when the image was edited.\n\nJennifer Lawrence appeared on the June 2011 cover of Flare magazine.\n\nJennifer Lawrence on the cover of Flare.\n\nThe original photos show that Lawrence's cover image was modified heavily.\n\nHer body looks different in the original photos.\n\nThese were all pronounced to look more 'idealised' in editing.\n\nHer waist was thinned and her cheekbones and collarbone are noticeably more pronounced.\n\nLawrence has been outspoken on her dislike of altered images.\n\nKerry Washington's 2016 Adweek cover didn't thrill the actress.\n\nKerry Washington on April 2016's Adweek cover.\n\nShe expressed her unhappiness on Instagram.\n\nShe said it looks very different from what she sees when she looks in the mirror.\n\nKerry Washington in 2017.\n\n\"I just felt weary,\" Washington wrote on Instagram. \"It felt strange to look at a picture of myself that is so different from what I look like when I look in the mirror. It's an unfortunate feeling.\"\n\nAdweek's editorial director at the time said the magazine made \"minimal adjustments.\"\n\n\"Kerry Washington is a class act. We are honored to have her grace our pages,\" James Cooper said in a statement. \"To clarify, we made minimal adjustments, solely for the cover's design needs. We meant no disrespect, quite the opposite. We are glad she is enthusiastic about the piece and appreciate her honest comments.\"\n\nKim Kardashian West wore a tight black getup in the April/May 2009 issue of Complex Magazine.\n\nKim Kardashian in a 2009 issue of Complex.\n\nBut Compex made a huge mistake.\n\nThe original photo was accidentally uploaded on the Complex website.\n\nIt's not the only time Kardashian West was Photoshopped.\n\nKardashian West was made to look like she has smoother, lighter skin, and a thinner appearance in the retouched version.\n\nShe was fine with it.\n\n\"So what: I have a little cellulite,\" she wrote on her website. \"What curvy girl doesn't!?\"\n\nIt's far from the only timeKim has been in a photoshop fail.\n\nPriyanka Chopra's armpit was Photoshopped out of existence in her 2016 Maxim cover.\n\nPriyanka Chopra on the cover of Maxim.\n\nHer arm seems to just stick out of her torso.\n\nAfter her armpit went viral, the actress joked about it on Twitter.\n\nAt least she had a sense of humour about it.\n\nChopra took the mistake in stride.\n\nBritney Spears looks fitter than ever in her \"Work B**ch\" music video from October 2013.\n\nBritney Spears in her 'Work B**ch' music video, singing the praises of Bugatis and Masaratis.\n\nAnd her dancing in the music video remained as energetic as ever.\n\nBut it looks like her body was edited.\n\nBritney is already fit in real life.\n\nThe Daily Mail obtained pre-edited photos from editing service HOAX Films, where Spears' already-thin waist and thighs were further slimmed digitally.\n\nLook at this photo of Selena Gomez that was posted by her makeup artist.\n\nSelena Gomez.\n\nHung Vanngo does makeup for a lot of different celebrities.\n\nThe door appears warped \u2014 it may have been manipulated to make her hair look more volumized.\n\nThere's something wrong here.\n\nThe doorway is warped right above her shoulder, indicating that's where it was Photoshopped . The effect may have been to make Gomez's hair look more full than it actually is.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow graces the March 2012 cover of Harper's Bazaar.\n\nThe March 2012 cover for Harper's Bazaar.\n\nPaltrow wore a dress designed by Anthony Vaccarello.\n\nInside the magazine, something seemed wrong.\n\nThe placement of Paltrow's legs don't seem right.\n\nPaltrow seems to be pulling the hem of her dress around one of her legs, but the placement of that leg seems totally wrong.\n\nDoes this 2009 W magazine cover with Demi Moore look off to you?\n\nDemi Moore on the cover of 'W.'\n\nSome people thought it was Photoshopped.\n\nMoore denied any Photoshopping, but her hips appeared narrower than her thigh.\n\nNotice the width of her hips compared to her thigh.\n\nMoore defended the image on Twitter and shared what she said was the original unedited photo. But critics say the proportions are impossible.\n\nTennis player Andy Roddick appeared on the June/July 2007 cover of Men's Fitness.\n\nAndy Roddick on the cover of Men's Fitness.\n\nHe looked really buff, but he noticed something wrong.\n\nEven Roddick didn't recognise his huge arms in the retouched photo.\n\nFormer tennis player Andy Roddick at a 2016 benefit event.\n\nMagazine Photoshops disproportionately modify the appearance of women, but men aren't exempt.\n\n\"Little did I know I have 22-inch guns and a disappearing birthmark on my right arm,\" Roddick wrote on his blog post.\n\nThis 2013 ad for \"Pretty Little Liars\" wasn't popular with stars of the show.\n\nThe stars of 'Pretty Little Liars.'\n\nTwo of them criticised it for changing how they look.\n\nAshley Benson and Troian Bellisario both called it out.\n\n\"We all look ridiculous. Way too much photoshop.\" Benson wrote in a now-deleted Instagram post. \"We all have flaws. No one looks like this. It's not attractive.\"\n\nBellisario agreed with Benson's criticism.\n\n\"I couldn't agree more,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"Very cool concept as always. But aren't we attractive enough women as we are? Why can't we just look like us?\"\n\nIn another \"Pretty Little Liars\" ad, one actress seemed to be missing a leg.\n\nA 'Pretty Little Liars' poster from 2016.\n\nWho is it?\n\nIt's another case of a mangled leg.\n\nActress Sasha Pieterse lost her left leg somewhere.\n\nHello! magazine nabbed Prince William for the cover of its February 22, 2010 issue.\n\nPrince William on the cover of Hello!\n\nDo you see what's been modified?\n\nIt looks like the magazine filled out his hairline.\n\nPrince William in 2010.\n\nA receding hairline is always hard to deal with, and William's pose only emphasised it, so the magazine may have filled it in for that reason. He also usually has blonde-ish hair, but it was turned brown for the cover\n\nKristen Stewart appeared on the cover of Glamour's November 2011 issue.\n\nKristen Stewart on Glamour's cover.\n\nDo you see what looks Photoshopped?\n\nUpon closer inspection, Stewart seems to be missing her left forearm.\n\nWhere'd it go?\n\nIt could be carefully placed behind her leg, but it seems to have disappeared altogether while Stewart contorted herself into that pose.\n\nCountry music singer Faith Hill appeared on the July 2007 cover of Redbook.\n\nFaith Hill on the cover of Redbook.\n\nBut her proportions don't seem right.\n\nHer arms are totally wrong.\n\nThat arm seems way too big.\n\nSome retouch work left Hill with a nonexistent right arm, a left arm that's too big yet too thin in strange places, and a back that seems to collapse into an isosceles triangle.\n\nDrew Barrymore looked great in her white dress on InStyle's February 2012 cover.\n\nDrew Barrymore.\n\nBut something's missing.\n\nWhere's her left hip?\n\nHow did that happen?\n\nHer mouth also looks like it may have been Photoshopped to look more like a smirk than a smile.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker landed the March 2013 cover of Harper's Bazaar China.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker.\n\nShe doesn't look like herself, though.\n\nHer skin seems totally different in the magazine.\n\nThe real Sarah Jessica Parker.\n\nThe magazine gave her piercing, otherworldly eyes and perfect, glowing skin. High contrasting also makes her cheekbones really sharp.\n\nFans took issue with Kelly Clarkson's figure on Self's September 2009 cover.\n\nKelly Clarkson on the cover of Self.\n\nThe magazine distorted her figure.\n\n\"Do we retouch? Yes!\"\n\nKelly Clarkson in 2009.\n\nThe magazine digitally shed pounds off of Clarkson to make her look \"her personal best,\" according to then-editor-in-chief Lucy Danziger.\n\n\"Do we retouch? Yes! Did we alter her appearance? Only to make her look her personal best,\" Danziger said. \"Did we publish an act of fiction? No. Not unless you think all photos are that.\"\n\nIn the interview the magazine published, Clarkson said she was happy with her weight.\n\n\"My happy weight changes ... Sometimes I eat more; sometimes I play more. I'll be different sizes all the time,\"Clarkson said. \"When people talk about my weight, I'm like, 'You seem to have a problem with it; I don't. I'm fine!' I've never felt uncomfortable on the red carpet or anything.\"\n\nTime's June 27, 1994 cover featured O.J. Simpson's mugshot.\n\nO.J. Simpson on the cover of Time.\n\nIt was shortly after he was arrested for the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Simpson, and Ron Goldman.\n\nThe cover made his skin look much darker.\n\nIt's impossible to ignore the difference.\n\nCritics attacked the magazine, saying that it made him look darker to emphasise his skin colour and make it more \"menacing.\"\n\nCompare it, for example, to a Newsweek cover from the same time with the same photo. Newsweek didn't retouch the photo, making Time's cover look much worse by contrast.\n\nLindsay Lohan forgot to take care of one crucial feature in this shot.\n\nLohan posing for a photo.\n\n\"My feet look red lol-had to take that out. Only real red is my hair,\" she wrote in her now-deleted Instagram post.\n\nThe door behind her is warped, indicating that some parts were curved.\n\nDoors shouldn't look like that.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 definitely doesn't need any Photoshop.\n\nBut in this 2014 photo posted to her website, fans noticed something was amiss.\n\nThis stair isn't straight.\n\nHow are you supposed to walk down those?\n\nIt's not the first time she's been accused of manipulating her thigh gap in pictures.\n\nStrange stairs have also haunted other celebrities, like Lindsay Lohan.\n\nAriana Grande counted down the days until the release of her single \"Focus.\"\n\nAriana Grande in a promo for her 2015 single 'Focus.'\n\nLook carefully at her right hand.\n\nHer right hand looks bizarrely long.\n\nNot sure what happened there.\n\nIt could be because of the camera lens . Or maybe someone decided to make Grande's hand twice its usual size in Photoshop.\n\nModel Martha Hunt is selling a swimsuit with another model in this Victoria's Secret Instagram post.\n\nThere's something wrong here.\n\nBut something isn't right.\n\nDid something happen to her arm?\n\nIn this image, it looks like her left arm disappeared somehow , with an elbow impossibly far away from her body.\n\nThis Instagram photo from Taylor Swift got a lot of attention.\n\nTaylor Swift and Haim.\n\nIt was one of the few times Taylor Swift showed off her belly button on Instagram.\n\nBut the metal guardrail behind her and the band Haim shouldn't look like that.\n\nGuardrails shouldn't be flexible.\n\nAs with doorways and walls, there's a curved background feature that should appear straight. It's a dead giveaway for photoshopping\n\nJordyn Woods posted a photo with her BFF Kylie Jenner in May 2017.\n\nJordyn Woods and Kylie Jenner.\n\nBoth of them have huge followings on social media.\n\nLook closer at the carpet.\n\nThat doesn't look right.\n\nThe lines should be straight, but they have been distorted, indicating some digital work has been done\n\nKris Jenner has also been called out for Photoshop. Here's a selfie Gordon Ramsay posted.\n\nJust two cooks in the kitchen.\n\nThey met in 2014.\n\nAnd here's the version Jenner posted to her own Instagram page.\n\nThis looks different.\n\nThis John Mayer selfie was supposed to be a joke, right?\n\nThey look like cartoon characters.\n\nIn 2014, the singer posted a photo of himself with his friend Ricky Van Veen, who co-founded College Humour.\n\nNeedless to say, their skin is usually not that smooth.\n\nVan Veen and Mayer hanging out in 2011.\n\nMayer has a reputation as a prankster, and that Photoshop wasn't convincing.\n\nLupita Nyong'o graced the November 2017 issue of Grazia UK, but she looked a little different than expected.\n\nDoes her hair normally look like that?\n\nNyong'o wasn't happy with the result.\n\nThe magazine photoshopped off a lob of her natural hair.\n\nThe original images compared to the magazine cover.\n\nNyong'o posted unedited images on Instagram that revealed the magazine took off a chunk of her hair and smoothed out the rest.\n\nThe actress wasn't happy.\n\n\"I am disappointed that @graziauk invited me to be on their cover and then edited out and smoothed my hair to fit their notion of what beautiful hair looks like,\" Nyong'o wrote on Instagram. \"Had I been consulted, I would have explained that I cannot support or condone the omission of what is my native heritage with the intention that they appreciate that there is still a very long way to go to combat the unconscious prejudice against black women's complexion, hair style and texture.\"\n\nThe magazine later apologised for publishing a modified image.\n\nSolange Knowles had a similar situation with London's Evening Standard magazine. Notice anything weird about this image?\n\nSolange on the cover of the Evening Standard.\n\nThe issue was published in October of 2017.\n\nThey also chopped off a bunch of her hair.\n\nWhere's that loop go?\n\nSolange wasn't happy about it, referencing her song\"Don't Touch my Hair\" in an Instagram post. It's also a bizarre twist from the story, where she talks about the importance of being proud of natural hair. The article's writer also disowned the piece, unhappy with the edits made.\n\nRepresentatives for the Evening Standard later said they edited out her hair \"for layout purposes\" but apologised for the whole thing.\n\n\"Plainly we made the wrong call and we have offered our unreserved apologies to Solange,\" the magazine said in a statement.\n\nThere's a problem with Oprah in this Vanity Fair photo.\n\nOprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, and Tom Hanks in Vanity Fair.\n\nShe's featured in Vanity Fair's 2018 Hollywood issue , alongside other celebrities. Here's an \"outtake\" where Winfrey is hanging out with Reese Witherspoon and Tom Hanks.\n\nShe has an extra hand.\n\nSo that's how Oprah is so productive. Vanity Fair acknowledged the error and fixed the photo online.\n\nIn another photo published in the issue, it looks like Reese Witherspoon has three legs, but the magazine says it just appears that way because of a shadow from the draping of her dress.Decide for yourself.\n\nThere's something weird going on here with Emma Watson in a 2010 Burberry ad.\n\nHint: Look down.\n\nSomething's off here.\n\nShe's missing her right leg.\n\nAs you can see, it seems to disappear into nowhere.\n\nThis 2009 ad with the model Filipa Hamilton has a serious problem.\n\nFilipa Hamilton in a 2009 Ralph Lauren ad.\n\nIt's pretty obvious.\n\nThe proportions are completely wrong.\n\nThe advertisement's editors drastically distorted her proportions. After it was released, Hamilton stopped working with the brand.\n\n\"They fired me because they said I was overweight and I couldn't fit in their clothes anymore,\" Hamilton told the New York Daily News.\n\nA representative for Ralph Lauren said the image was published by mistake.\n\n\"The image in question was mistakenly released and used in a department store in Japan and was not the approved image which ran in the US,\" the company said. \"We take full responsibility.\"\n\nElizabeth Olsen appeared as Scarlett Witch with a few other Marvel characters on a cover of \"Empire\" in 2018.\n\nOlsen appeared on the cover alongside Benedict Cumberbatch.\n\nThe magazine released six different covers with different Marvel Cinematic Universe characters.\n\nOlsen didn't approve.\n\nThis is what Elizabeth Olsen normally looks like.\n\nElizabeth Olsen didn't recognise herself in the photo.\n\n\"Does this look like me?\" she asked in a now-deleted Instagram post.\n\nAllure pointed out that Olsen's cheekbones were sharpened and her skin darkened. Her hair, too, went from a blonde to something more brassy.\n\nA lot seems wrong with this Kim Kardashian West's Instagram post from March.\n\nSomething doesn't seem right.\n\nThe image was supposed to promote the March For Our Lives rallies against gun violence.\n\nThe entire world is wobbly.\n\nAs many people noticed, a parked car behind her looks like it's been squished into a thin triangular shape and the ground seems to bend behind her, as if there's a seam in the concrete running across the parking lot. The shadows behind her legs also look artificial.\n\nThough the photo has more than 1.6 million likes, it has no comments. The Daily Mail reported that Kardashian West disabled comments after she was called out for Photoshopping.\n\nIn a post on her website, Kardashian West said the photo was cropped from an image a fan made with a mirror effect, which is why there seems to be a seam on the image's right side.\n\nLady Gaga didn't like her 2013 Glamour cover.\n\nLady Gaga on the December 2013 edition of Glamour.\n\nShe had an issue with a common Photoshop technique.\n\nAt Glamour's \"Woman of the Year\" awards, she told her fans to \"fight back against the forces that make them feel like they're not beautiful.\"\n\nLady Gaga at the 2013 Glamour annual Women of the Year awards ceremony.\n\nOn the magazine cover, her face looked airbrushed.\n\nWhen the magazine honored her at their \"Woman of the Year\" event, she used her platform at the event to criticise the modification of women's bodies in media.\n\n\"It is fair to write about the change in your magazines. But what I want to see is the change on your covers,\" Gaga said. \"When the covers change, that's when culture changes.\"\n\nKate Winslet, too, was displeased with her February 2003 GQ UK cover.\n\nKate Winslet on the cover of GQ UK.\n\nParts of it had been retouched.\n\nWinslet disparaged it in another magazine interview.\n\nHer legs are all wrong.\n\nTalking to Hello! magazine, Winslet said her legs were totally changed.\n\n\"The retouching is excessive. I do not look like that and more importantly, I don't desire to look like that,\" Winslet said. \"I actually have a Polaroid that the photographer gave me on the day of the shoot ... I can tell you they have reduced the size of my legs by about a third. For my money, it looks pretty good the way it was taken.\"\n\nGQ UK's editor at the time, Dylan Jones, said the Photoshop was fine.\n\n\"We do that for everyone, whether they are a size six or a size 12,\" he told the BBC. \"It hasn't a lot to do with body size. Practically every photo you see in a magazine will have been digitally altered in this way.\"\n\nJake Paul posted a photo of himself flexing before an upcoming boxing match.\n\nJake Paul in a promo for an upcoming boxing match.\n\nBefore his boxing match with fellow YouTube celebrity KSI,Jake Paul has been posting several photos of himself shirtless and ready to fight. But there's something off about this one.\n\nThose muscles look weirdly transparent.\n\nJake Paul's muscles are probably not see-through.\n\nIn other photos, his shoulder muscles are much smaller.\n\nBrad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio look fit in this \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" promo shot.\n\nBrad Pit and Leonardo DiCaprio in a publicity still for 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.'\n\nIn August 2018, Sony uploaded a picture of Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio in Quentin Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,\" dressed in 1970s-era outfits.\n\nTheir necks don't look right.\n\nBut Sony uploaded the wrong version of the photo to its publicity site. Anyone with the right software, Page Six reported, could see the image's edit history, which showed that both of their necks had been modified. DiCaprio normally has a bigger chin, too, and some of Pitt's wrinkles had been removed.\n\nThis Calvin Klein ad with Kourtney Kardashian had a lot of people talking in August.\n\nA Calvin Klein ad featuring Kourtney Kardashian.\n\nThe Kardashian-Jenner family do a lot of ads with the underwear brand, but there's something wrong about this one.\n\nPeople said her arm looked way too slim to be real. Calvin Klein said it was just the lighting.\n\nIs it just the lighting?\n\nA number of people said Kourtney's arm was unrealistically slim in the photo, Photoshopped to look thinner than humanly possible.\n\nBut according to Calvin Klein, the effect is a combination of poor lighting and low-resolution social media images. The sunlight is making part of Kardashian's arm light enough to blend in with the background, the company told INSIDER.\n\n\"As you'll see from the high-res version of the image, there are no issues with Kourtney's arm,\" Calvin Klein, Inc. wrote in a statement. \"However, the light is hitting it which makes it slightly less defined. Unfortunately, when the image is posted to social media in a lower-resolution format, the shape of her arm loses its definition, creating the effect which social media users have commented on.\"\n\nThis story originally appeared on Business Insider.", "description": "Magazines have always been in the business of crafting celebrity appearances.
