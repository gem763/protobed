Cohen, for payments he made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels, who had said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has denied having an affair with her.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers sued last month to block the subpoena. The lawyers acknowledged that their constitutional argument had not been tested, but said presidents have such enormous responsibility and a unique position in government that they cannot be burdened with investigations, especially by local prosecutors who might be politically motivated.\n\nThe case also drew in the Justice Department, which did not take a position on the merits of the president\u2019s argument but supported his request to delay enforcement of the subpoena because of the \u201csignificant constitutional issues.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for the president and a spokesman for Mr. Vance both declined to comment on Monday, as did a spokeswoman for the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cThis case presents momentous questions of first impression regarding the presidency, federalism and the separation of powers,\u201d a lawyer for the president, Patrick Strawbridge, wrote to the appeals court in requesting that the judges block the subpoena. He said the losing party should be given time to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe decision was a victory for Mr. Vance, whose office had asked Judge Marrero to dismiss Mr. Trump\u2019s suit, saying the president was intentionally delaying the subpoena.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have called the investigation by Mr. Vance, a Democrat, politically motivated. Mr. Vance has accused the president and his team of trying to drag out the investigation until the statute of limitations runs out on any possible crime.", "description": "A judge rejected the president\u2019s argument that he was immune from criminal investigations.", "authors": ["William K.
