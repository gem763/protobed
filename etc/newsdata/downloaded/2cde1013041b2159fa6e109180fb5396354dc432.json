We are all hypocritical to greater or lesser degrees,\" wrote Damon Hill, now a pundit. \"But if people like him don't speak out then we all carry on in the same vein and don't even try to change. Its not that bad, eating carrots #f1 #carrots\"\n\nHamilton is used to flak.\n\nIn November 2015, he drew the ire of animals rights groups for posts on Twitter and Facebook that he felt expressed his love of cute, furry animals.\n\nThe Facebook photos showed him cuddling a jaguar cub and a new-born lion at the Black Jaguar White Tiger Foundation in Mexico, with hashtags including #cutestthingever and #animallover. A Twitter video showed him creeping up on a larger tiger and scaring it.\n\nThe posts drew ferocious criticism on social media.\n\nThe director of People for the Ethical Treatment Of Animals (PETA), Elisa Allen, released a long statement that started: \"Seeing big cats used for photo ops promotes the idea that wild animals are here for human amusement.\"\n\nIn 2011, complaining on the BBC that he was being victimised by stewards, Hamilton jokingly borrowed a line from British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen: \"Maybe it's because I'm black, I don't know. That's what Ali G says...\"\n\nHamilton had to write a letter of apology to Jean Todt, the president of the governing body of motor sports.\n\nIn 2018, Hamilton backed the return of grid girls at that year's Monaco Grand Prix by posting a grab from another Instagram user showing five buxom grid girls, and adding \"Thank you Jesus\".\n\nThat drew the ire not only of feminists but also of Christians. Hamilton, whose Instagram self-description contains the line \"Spread LOVE and God above all\", deleted the post.\n\nBefore the 2016 Japanese Grand Prix, he switched apps and got in trouble for using Snapchat during an official press conference. He posted bunny-ear photos, with the caption: \"This is s---- killing me.\"\n\nBritish tabloids let rip, labelling Hamilton \"Snap-Prat\" and the \"Berk in the Merc\" -- slang terms for \"fool\".\n\nHamilton responded by saying journalists had been \"disrespectful\" and walking out on a media event.\n\nHe also provoked contrasting reactions with two posts about princesses in 2017.\n\nAt Christmas, Hamilton posted a video showing his young nephew sporting a blue and pink dress as they visited Disneyland.\n\n\"I'm so sad right now. Look at my nephew,\" the British driver wrote. The video contains an exchange which ends with Hamilton shouting: \"Boys don't wear princess dresses\" which led to the youngster covering his ears.\n\nHamilton took the post down, describing his outburst as a \"lapse of judgement\". He also designed a kilt in collaboration with Tommy Hilfiger and wore it in a fashion shoot for GQ, telling the magazine \"I want to make amends\". GQ used that line in a promotional Instagram post.\n\nEarlier that year, he paid tribute to Princess Diana, who had died 20 years earlier, by posting a poem he had written, \"England's Rose\", on Instagram.\n\nThe poem may have lacked literary merit and resembled Elton John's \"Candle in the Wind\", but this time many on social media gushed over it.\n\nIn a separate tribute on Twitter, Hamilton acknowledged the anniversary with a quote often attributed to the Princess. \"I don't go by the rule book,\" he wrote. \"I lead from the heart, not the head.\"", "description": "Even though he deleted the pro-vegan post that started the trouble, Lewis Hamilton continued to be the centre of social media debate.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7520/01f8e26bfa36457d97f166f7a8b68f0e.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
