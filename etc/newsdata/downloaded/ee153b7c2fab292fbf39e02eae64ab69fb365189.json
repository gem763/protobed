Goods imported to the province from outside the EU will be subject to UK duties, as usual.\n\nBut if goods from non-EU countries come into the EU via Northern Ireland, it will be up to Britain to apply EU customs \u2014 which could pose problems.\n\nNorthern Ireland business leaders have already asked London to help them absorb the cost of the extra paperwork.\n\nValue Added Tax is another sensitive issue. To protect the integrity of the single European market, EU rules concerning sales tax on goods will continue to apply to Northern Ireland.\n\nAs it stands, businesses are cautious about the deal until parliament votes for it, particularly given opposition from lawmakers.\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t pass, Johnson is legally bound to ask Brussels for an extension, which will again prolong uncertainty surrounding the economy and revive the prospect of a feared no-deal Brexit.\n\nApproval will only mean the start of a process to negotiate a trade agreement between Britain and the EU, which could also be no easy task.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, which was welcomed by business with a sigh of relief, could limit the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/ef025f_hard-brexit-but-doesn-it-good-business-johnson-brexit-lesser-evil-uk-economy-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
