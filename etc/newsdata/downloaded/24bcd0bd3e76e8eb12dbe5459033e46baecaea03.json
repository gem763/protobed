It stopped after a while and returned when she was 12 so she dismissed it as a migraine.\n\n\u201cI attributed the pain to migraines, but the pain became debilitating when I was 15 and I knew it wasn\u2019t just migraines anymore.\n\n\u201cI was putting makeup on so touching my face when the pain was triggered. I was terrified and I had no idea what was happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I had a brain tumour and that I was dying because I didn\u2019t think that such a level of pain was possible without me knocking on death\u2019s door,\u201d she recalls.\n\nThe young woman went to see her doctor, who admitted he had no idea what the problem was. Mackenzie was then prescribed migraine medication, antibiotics and allergy medication.\n\nA few months later, in October 2013, a flare-up occurred and Mackenzie was kept in hospital for a week to be monitored. Doctors performed blood tests, a CT scan, an MRI scan and a lumbar puncture.\n\nBut all of the tests and scans came back negative and Mackenzie was then referred to the complex pain clinic.\n\nShe was seen at the clinic in April 2014 and Mackenzie recalls the doctor turning pale and asking if he could have a couple of minutes to discuss her case with his colleagues before confirming the diagnosis.\n\nMackenzie was diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN), a rare form of nerve damage whereby even the faintest of facial stimulation, such as brushing teeth, eating, talking and kissing, can cause excruciating pain.\n\nMackenzie tried numerous medications and in March 2015 she underwent microvascular decompression surgery to relieve the pressure on her brain in the hopes that it would reduce the pain.\n\nThe surgery appeared to have been a success until three months later when she her condition exacerbated and she had to be admitted to the ICU.\n\nAs the pain returned, Mackenzie had to undergo physical, mental and occupational therapy to cope with TN.\n\nThe disease has halted Mackenzie\u2019s life as she\u2019s had to give up on her dreams of studying medicine because any slight movement or stimulation to her face leaves her in crippling pain for days.\n\nDespite this, Mackenzie is thankful that her boyfriend, Jon, knew her before the illness took hold of her. He saw her before it left her housebound. She does admit that her condition can make it painful to kiss each other.\n\n\u201cBefore, I was planning on going to med school and I was a dancer too but all of that stopped,\u201d Mackenzie says.\n\n\u201cThe side effects from medication and the pain itself makes it too hard to focus and learn. I can barely move without being overwhelmed by pain, so working isn\u2019t an option. There are things I wanted in the future, like having children, which may not be possible anymore.\n\n\u201cI feel lucky that my boyfriend knew me before my illness and he got to see me at my full capacity. He\u2019s seen what I\u2019m capable of in both an able and disabled body,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cOne of the hardest things is feeling like a burden as he\u2019s young and I worry about holding him back. It also sometimes hurts to kiss him, which can be really frustrating for us.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019d love to show people that being dealt a bad hand doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have a fulfilling life.\u201d\n\nSource: Magazine Features", "description": "\u201cI attributed the pain to migraines, but the pain became debilitating when I was 15 and I knew it wasn\u2019t just migraines anymore.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9520/13302c6592bf4cccbdcfa0f7ca4f1f0a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
