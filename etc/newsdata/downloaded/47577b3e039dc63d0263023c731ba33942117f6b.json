(Photo: Gabi Zietsman)\n\nIt grows in the highest altitudes of the world-famous rocky landscape, highly susceptible to fires due to its combustible oil. Unlike the fynbos that surrounds it, the cedar tree doesn't regrow or resprout after a fire - once burnt all that remains is a prophetic skeleton that eerily juts out on the rocky outcrops\n\nClimate change has also impacted heavily on its germination rate. The cedar tree seed needs a lot of moisture to germinate, and the reduced rain in the region means it will lie dormant in the soil for too long, eaten by rodents and birds before it can finally bloom. And it takes 30 years for a cedar tree to bear its bounty.\n\nBut the species has one saving grace - efforts made by Bushmans Kloof Wilderness Reserve and provincial conservation authority CapeNature has a planting project that will hopefully ensure its survival. They collect seeds and then grow them in nurseries until they're strong enough to be replanted in the wilderness, full of hope of growing a sizeable forest.\n\nALSO WATCH: Bouldering fun for all ages in the Cederberg\n\nCedar trees.

The small Cederberg village of Heuningvlei becomes a hive of activity, with children using their small fingers to plant the seeds and the seedlings from the nurseries are driven on dusty roads to their final home.\n\nElizabethfontein Primary School's rieldans troupe puts on a show for the planters. (Photo: Gabi Zietsman)\n\nSome seedlings get a Waterboxx - a Dutch invention that traps the little water offered to the parched earth and drips into the young tree's roots to increase its survival rate. Once they are big enough, the Waterboxx is removed and used again on a new saplings.\n\nThis small cedar tree is naturally occurring - it was never planted by humans. (Photo: Gabi Zietsman)\n\nEveryone gets a chance to plant their own in the slow-growing forest, and return enthusiasts check on the ones they have planted before, seeing if they managed to survive the harsh conditions of the Cederberg.\n\nMany however do not make it - but that doesn't mean we should stop trying.\n\nREAD: The nicest damn cave I\u2019ve ever slept in!\n\nThe outskirts of the cedar tree forest that CapeNature and Bushmans Kloof is trying to grow.

The family-friendly event is free, but accommodation in Cederberg might fill up fast around that time. You would need a 4x4 to get to the event, but some transport arrangements can be made ahead of time.\n\nFind Your Escape by searching and comparing flight prices here.
