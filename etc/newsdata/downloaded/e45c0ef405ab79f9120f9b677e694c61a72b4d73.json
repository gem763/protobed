McDonald\u2019s Already Knows the Answer", "language": "en", "text": "So far, however, Domino\u2019s has stopped short of the latest McDonald\u2019s play: acquiring entire tech start-ups. (Pizza Hut, however, recently acquired a company that produces online ordering software.) In March, McDonald\u2019s spent more than $300 million to buy Dynamic Yield, the Tel Aviv-based company that developed the artificial intelligence tools now used at thousands of McDonald\u2019s drive-throughs.\n\nThe deal \u201chas changed the way the high-tech industry thinks about potential M&A,\u201d said Liad Agmon, a former Israeli intelligence official who co-founded Dynamic Yield. \u201cWe\u2019ll see more nontraditional tech companies buying tech companies as an accelerator for their digital efforts. It was genius on McDonald\u2019s side.\u201d\n\nAlready, the recommendation algorithms built into the drive-through menu boards have generated larger orders, the McDonald\u2019s chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, said during an earnings call in July. (Mr. Henry, the chain\u2019s information executive, declined to reveal the size of the increase.) By the end of the year, the new system is expected to be in place at nearly every McDonald\u2019s drive-through in the U.S.\n\nIn September, McDonald\u2019s purchased a second tech company, Apprente, a start-up based in Mountain View, Calif., that develops voice-activated platforms that can process orders in multiple languages and accents. In recent months, McDonald\u2019s has tested voice recognition at some of its restaurants, seeking to replace the human workers who take orders with a faster system.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s insists that the rollout of the voice technology will not cost jobs. But at a time when it faces renewed protests from workers over low wages and sexual harassment, the chain\u2019s new focus on technology could intensify scrutiny of how it treats its workers and how they might be affected by automation. While McDonalds has reported impressive growth over the last couple of years, some employees at its restaurants make less than $10 an hour.\n\n\u201cTry raising a family on that,\u201d said Adriana Alvarez, an employee in Cicero, Ill., who has helped lead the high-profile campaign for a $15 hourly wage at McDonald\u2019s. \u201cThe company should be able to balance tech and other investments and, in the process, ensure workers like me are safe on the job and have a seat at the table.\u201d", "description": "The fast-food chain is turning to artificial intelligence and machine learning in the hopes of predicting what customers want before they decide.", "authors": ["David Yaffe-Bellany"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/07/business/07mctech/00mctech-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
