When Questioned About Trump Tweets\n\nThe audio and an article outlining the context of the conversation dropped Thursday after Conway, according to the piece, took issue with a Tuesday write-up that mentioned her husband George Conway, a conservative lawyer who frequently publicly criticizes her boss, President Trump.\n\nIn the call, which reporter Caitlin Yilek says was initiated by Conway\u2019s assistant without mention of the fact that Conway herself would take over once the assistant established the chat was off-record, the top White House aide says, \u201cSo I just am wondering why in God\u2019s earth you would need to mention anything about George Conway\u2019s tweets in an article that talks about me as possibly being chief of staff. Other than it looks to me like there\u2019s no original reporting here, you just read Twitter and other people\u2019s stuff, which I guess is why you don\u2019t pick up the phone when people call from the White House because, if it\u2019s not on Twitter or it\u2019s not on cable TV, it\u2019s not real.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Kellyanne Conway Chides George Conway Over Trump Criticism: 'Air Grievances Like That in Private'\n\nIn her own statement posted to Twitter, Conway pushed back on the description of how the call came to be, writing she \u201cgrabbed the phone from a colleague\u201d and \u201cdid NOT indicate the call was off-the-record, but the reporter certainly thought it was.\u201d\n\nIn the call, Conway sarcastically told Yilek the reporter is \u201creally going places,\u201d and said, \u201cLet me tell you something, from a powerful woman. Don\u2019t pull the crap where you\u2019re trying to undercut another woman based on who she\u2019s married to. He gets his power through me, if you haven\u2019t noticed. Not the other way around. And if these are the quote standards unquote at the Washington Examiner, then yes I\u2019d be happy to talk to your editor. But I\u2019ve known your editor since before you were born.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: President Trump Rips 'Mr Kellyanne Conway' as a 'Husband From Hell,' 'Stone Cold Loser'\n\nIn her statement on the call and its release, Conway said part of her job duties includes engaging with reporters to \u201canswer substantive questions about the business of the White House,\u201d but she has been \u201csubjected to personal questions which seem gossipy, inappropriate and irrelevant.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cI\u2019ve previously noted that it is unusual \u2014 especially in Washington and especially in Republican politics \u2014 for a man to gain newfound fame and power through his wife, following his own storied, decades-long career as a respected and outstanding litigator in New York, which I have long admired. Like every couple I know, George and I disagree on many big things and agree on many big things. Exactly none of it affects my position as Counselor to the President. Exactly none of it is anyone\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nA representative for the Examiner did not immediately return a request for further comment.\n\nRead original story Washington Examiner Top Editor Defends Release of Kellyanne Conway Audio: No Excuse for \u2018Abusing\u2019 Reporters At TheWrap", "description": "On Thursday, the Washington Examiner released audio of presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway berating a reporter.Examiner editor-in-chief Hugo Gordon said that even \u201coff the record conversations \u2026 are not, and never have been, blanked coverage to shield people who pull a bait and switch, peremptorily", "authors": ["Lindsey Ellefson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.wyn2ZM783od18EDUI1VlQ--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thewrap.com/97efaf1fea0a2da98b5f3124ba6c819e", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
