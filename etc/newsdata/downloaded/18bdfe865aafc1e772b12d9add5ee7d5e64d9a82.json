I think you're wrong.\n\nSTELTER: So give me some evidence.\n\nZUCKER: Watch it. ... I think it's doing a disservice to the country. But that's the path that the Murdochs have decided to go down.\n\nThe big picture: CNN and Fox News have butted heads in the Trump era, with both networks consistently attacking each other for alleged bias.\n\nZucker acknowledged that there are talented, news-focused journalists within Fox, but argued that those figures alone \"don't make it a news organization.\"\n\nZucker also commented on the departure of Fox anchor Shep Smith, who was viewed as a moderate and Trump critic within the conservative-leaning network, saying that it's \"not a place where somebody like Shep Smith could work.\" He called Smith \"talented\" and said he would be \"very open to talking to him\" when he becomes available.\n\nThe CNN president also argued the Murdoch family, which runs Fox News, is responsible \"for a lot of problems in this country\" by helping spread conspiracy theories.\n\nThe other side: Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst shot back at Zucker on Twitter, listing a lengthy thread of Fox stories that he says have held those in power accountable over the past year.\n\n\"If you don't think Fox News is a 'journalistic organization,' I'd encourage you to take a look at the work my colleagues have done over the past year. Holding those in power accountable, risking their lives to get the story and reporting the facts.\"\n\nFox News did not provide a comment.\n\nGo deeper: Conservative news goes to war over impeachment", "description": "\"I think it's doing a disservice to the country.
