House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) accused Maguire of violating the law.\n\nAs tensions between Congress and the Trump administration mount, intelligence whistleblower laws are under a national spotlight.\n\nAre intelligence whistleblowers protected by law?\n\nA whistleblower is a person who exposes information or activities that are unlawful, unethical or in violation of a company\u2019s policy. Federal whistleblower protection laws and most states\u2019 laws make it illegal to retaliate against an employee who reports employer violations or misconduct.\n\nIntelligence whistleblowers face additional hurdles and more severe consequences \u2014 not only termination of employment but also the threat of criminal prosecution \u2014 because of the confidential nature of information that their concerns could include.\n\nThe Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, passed by Congress in 1998 and incorporated at the creation of the Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General in 2010, fashioned a special set of procedures for employees to report misconduct that guarantee classified information remains classified.\n\nUnder the statute, an intelligence whistleblower is protected from retaliation so long as he or she follows the protocol when filing a complaint.\n\nHow does an intelligence whistleblower file a complaint?\n\nThe employee submits the complaint to the inspector general of the intelligence community. The inspector general is required to review it within 14 days and then determines whether the complaint is of \u201curgent concern,\u201d which is defined as involving conduct \u201crelating to\u201d the \u201cadministration or operation of an intelligence activity within the authority of the Director of National Intelligence involving classified information.\u201d\n\nIf the complaint appears credible, the inspector general is required to forward it to the director of national intelligence, who then has seven days to send the complaint and any accompanying information to congressional intelligence oversight committees. If the inspector general decides it\u2019s not credible, or if he or she does not act on the complaint, the whistleblower can contact the congressional intelligence committees directly but must tell the inspector general and seek guidance from the director of national intelligence to contact the committees securely.\n\nTrump\u2019s acting intelligence chief told to turn over whistleblower complaint or face public questioning by Congress\n\nWhat happened here?\n\nOn Aug. 12, an intelligence community employee submitted a complaint to acting inspector general Michael Atkinson, who concluded the report was urgent and credible and forwarded it to Maguire.\n\nMaguire, however, did not send it to the intelligence committees within seven days, as the statute requires, and failed to give the whistleblower guidance on how to securely contact the committees directly. Since then, Maguire has also refused to comply with a subpoena issued by the House Intelligence Committee, compelling him to produce an unredacted copy of the whistleblower complaint.\n\nIn a Sept. 17 letter to Schiff, Maguire\u2019s general counsel, Jason Klitenic, said the whistleblower complaint was determined not to be an \u201curgent concern.\u201d\n\nThe law did not require the director of national intelligence to forward it to Congress because it involved \u201cconduct by someone outside the Intelligence Community and did not relate to any \u2018intelligence activity within the responsibility and authority of the DNI,\u2019 \u201d he claimed.\n\nKlitenic also said the complaint involved \u201cconfidential and potentially privileged communications.\u201d Disclosure would violate the president\u2019s authority to control classified information and the whistleblower and inspector general were barred from sending the information directly to Congress, he said.\n\n9 questions about the Trump whistleblower complaint, answered\n\nCan he do that?\n\nThe Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act has no provision for what should happen if the inspector general determines something is of urgent concern but the director of national intelligence refuses to forward it to Congress. The scenario has never come up before.\n\nBut some legal experts say that, because the law doesn\u2019t directly address this issue, it means the inspector general has the final say.\n\n\u201cThe DNI cannot countermand the inspector general\u2019s determination,\u201d Jesselyn Radack, a national security lawyer known for her defense of whistleblowers, told The Post.\n\nHere, though, there\u2019s an additional wrinkle: The director of national intelligence also consulted the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel\n\nRobert Litt, former general counsel to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, explained in a piece published by Lawfare: \u201c[Office of Legal Counsel] opinions are considered to be binding and authoritative interpretations of law within the executive branch. So if OLC in fact formally opined that this complaint was not an \u2018urgent concern\u2019 as defined in the statute, the DNI could take the position that the IG must follow that interpretation.\u201d\n\nWhat about the Trump administration?\n\nThus far, The Post reports, the White House has stopped short of asserting privilege over the complaint, though Klitenic suggested in his letter that it would try to prevent Maguire from complying with committee subpoenas.\n\nA hallmark of past administrations has been vast presidential power to control disclosure of classified information; Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both championed whistleblower protections yet reiterated that the Whistleblower Protection Act did not undercut the president\u2019s authority.\n\n\u201cThe executive branch has always asserted the right to withhold deliberative material or presidential communications from Congress,\u201d Litt wrote, concluding that it\u2019s possible the privilege could protect the president\u2019s communications with foreign leaders.\n\n\u201cThe extent of such a privilege \u2014 and in particular whether it would protect communications that might constitute bribery \u2014 is untested,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the White House asserted such a privilege, the ODNI would be bound to honor it.\u201d\n\nIn a Twitter thread Thursday, Jack Goldsmith, a former assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel, similarly said that this was the \u201cstandard executive branch position\u201d of many administrations and \u201cshould control here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s power to act in confidence is at its absolute height when he has a classified conversation with a foreign leader,\u201d Goldsmith wrote. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a defense of Trump; it\u2019s a defense of the presidency.\u201d\n\nTop Democrat threatens legal action if intelligence chief doesn\u2019t share whistleblower complaint\n\nCan the whistleblower or inspector general disclose the complaint to Congress anyway?\n\nEmployees of the executive branch aren\u2019t required to follow the White House\u2019s guidance.\n\nStill, legal experts are divided on whether the whistleblower and/or the inspector general could be prosecuted for sharing the complaint with congressional oversight committees, which are qualified to receive classified information.\n\nGoldsmith said criminality depended on what was in the complaint, calling the decision to disclose \u201cpolitical and personally risky.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the IG or the [U.S. government] employee believes the president has engaged in an act of national treachery, they can leak the information, which is a crime, and suffer the consequences,\u201d he wrote, adding that unless Trump\u2019s conduct rose to the level of objective betrayal \u2014 where leaking information would be warranted, justifiable and forgivable \u2014 then it should remain within the executive branch.\n\nSusan Hennessey, a Brookings Institution fellow in national security law and general counsel of the Lawfare Institute, wrote Thursday that it would \u201calmost certainly not be a crime\u201d if it was done in a secured space.\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be prosecuted; they\u2019d just be fired,\u201d she added.\n\nMarty Lederman, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel, agreed, saying\u201cit probably wouldn\u2019t be criminal for the whistleblower or IG to leak.\u201d\n\nThe real risk, he said, is being fired for breaching terms of employment.\n\nThe disagreement between respected members of the legal community highlights the unprecedented challenges posed by this complaint. What\u2019s clear, though, is that the whistleblower would assume some risk. When facing possible retaliation or criminal prosecution, \u201calmost certainly not\u201d and \u201cprobably wouldn\u2019t be\u201d are less-than-adequate reassurances.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nIn his letter, Klitenic said the Office of the Director of National Intelligence was willing to work with Congress in the accommodation process. Still, it\u2019s unclear whether he and Schiff will be able to reach an acceptable resolution.\n\nMany have surmised that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into the Bidens by threatening to withhold U.S. military and financial aid.\n\nIf the complaint contained that information, a former intelligence official told The Post, \u201cit\u2019s hard to imagine this White House agreeing to its release in any form.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nCongress doesn\u2019t have a lot of options to get this whistleblower complaint\n\nRudolph W.
