So we need to start thinking about how we're going to do this otherwise what happens is AEMO has to intervene.\n\nPrioritising clear channels of energy transmission is important too. Investors spending hundreds of millions to build a plant isn't a strong investment if the power can't be transmitted to the customer.\n\n\"We need to look at these renewable energy zones\" to ensure the amount of power generated can reach a customer, she said.", "description": "\"We can\u2019t afford to run economy where people are worrying about keeping the lights on a hot day,\" says energy market regulator.
