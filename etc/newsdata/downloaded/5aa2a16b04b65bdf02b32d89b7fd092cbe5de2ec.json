And given the number of shootings in recent times, the frustration and fear of the citizenry and the all-courts-press of the Democrats and left to crack down on gun rights, come heck or high water, the fact is America, on Second Amendment freedoms, is marching toward tough times.\n\nWe\u2019ve let business stick its nose where it doesn\u2019t belong.\n\nWe\u2019ve let the left redefine the narrative of the Second Amendment to the point where it\u2019s become a right of recreation, not protection.\n\nWe\u2019ve lost sight of the fact that a government that fears the people, at least to a degree, is a government that\u2019s controlled by the people \u2014 and that the single most fearful means a people possesses to control the government is guns.\n\n\u201cOnce World War II came to an end, Eastern European countries took after their Soviet overlords and started implementing gun confiscation,\u201d the Mises Institute wrote, back in mid-2018.\n\nAs Mises then detailed, these regimes took to disarming their people. Bulgaria\u2019s communists seized firearms. East Germany\u2019s government banned private ownership of guns. Hungary\u2019s communist leaders shuttered clubs and organizations tied to gun activities.\n\nIn the late 1950s, when Fidel Castro rose to power in Cuba, one of his first acts was to confiscate guns \u2014 using the firearms registration list put in place by the island nation\u2019s former dictator, Fulgencio Batista.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget current conditions in downtrodden Venezuela, where the government, already drunk with power and emboldened by its property seizures, outright banned the sales of firearms in 2012.\n\nThe rationale? To fight crime.\n\nTo fight the massive crime the Venezuelan government itself has stoked because of its age of burdensome, soul-killing socialism.\n\nDemocrats argue the anti-crime angle, too. And they do so all the while scoffing at the histories of dictatorial countries, and how curbs on private gun ownership enable the dictators.\n\nStill, on the Second Amendment, it\u2019s been a hard slog for the left.\n\nNow comes Big Business. Doing the dirty work that Second Amendment-curbing deeds the Democrats can\u2019t get done themselves.\n\n\u201cWe are joining other retailers in asking our customers to no longer openly carry firearms into our stores other than authorized law enforcement officials,\u201d Walgreens posted, echoing what Walmart and Kroger, CVS and Wegmans, put out this week as well.\n\nIt comes as a request. But its tone is a ban. Either way, this is bad, bad policy.\n\nGiving law enforcement a pass creates a two-tier system that sets government above the private citizen \u2014 a dangerous thing in itself, because in this country, in America, it\u2019s government that holds the role of servant; the people who hold the title of employer. It\u2019s citizens\u2019 rights first \u2014 government\u2019s, second.\n\nPretending, once again, that curbing the abilities of legal gun owners to possess, purchase and carry weapons will somehow reel in gun-related crimes in America is the second danger, as it feeds a delusion that\u2019s been allowed to go on far too long. A delusion that\u2019s been debunked by layer upon layer of empirical data. A delusion the determined Democrats nonetheless won\u2019t let die.\n\nAs for the third danger?\n\nThe third danger comes by way of letting businesses step in and take a bite out of the Second Amendment \u2014 particularly in those states where the Constitution\u2019s right to carry has been underscored and highlighted and emphasized via additional codes and laws passed by those states\u2019 governments. By those states\u2019 duly elected government officials.\n\nDo we really want a country with a Constitution In Name Only?\n\nDo we really want a country where rights don\u2019t actually come from God \u2014 they come from Big Business?\n\nThis is the path America\u2019s treading right now.\n\nBut it\u2019s not too late to stop.\n\nStates have in their powers the ability to make clear that businesses that do business within their borders must abide the constitutional rights of the citizens \u2014 else make their money elsewhere. This is not difficult to impose. After all, state governments wouldn\u2019t accept a free market argument against serving, say, blacks at restaurants owned by Ku Klux Klan members, would they?\n\nNeither should states \u2014 neither should citizens \u2014 accept that businesses automatically, without challenge, have the right to dictate the confines of the Second Amendment.\n\nCapitalism is great. But not when it chokes the Constitution. Not when it comes cloaked as Big Government intent on stealing God-given individual rights.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
