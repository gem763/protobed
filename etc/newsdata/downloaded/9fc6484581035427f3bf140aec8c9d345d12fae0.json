We sustained double-digit growth in service revenue led by growth in voice and data revenue,\u201d MTN Nigeria CEO, Ferdi Moolman.\n\nThe firm said the remaining quarter of the year would be focused on expanding the 4G network coverage and increasing active data subscriber growth.\n\n\n\nVoice and data revenue is expected to continue to grow on the back of subscriber growth and increasing demand for data services.\n\nMTN operates in 21 countries in Africa and the Middle East.
