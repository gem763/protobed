Then the song started moving units in the millions and climbed its way up the US Billboard charts, peaking at number 36 in 1980, and at number three on the UK Singles Chart. Rapper\u2019s Delight wasn\u2019t the first hip-hop song, but it was the genre\u2019s commercial Big Bang, and a sign that this music born in the housing project hallways and public parks of the Bronx was more than a passing fad.\n\nHip-hop is pop culture now. The genre\u2019s dominance of radio waves, streaming numbers, and billboard charts is undeniable, not to mention its influence on everything from avant-garde electronica to the DNA of mainstream pop music from artists like Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran and Ariana Grande.\n\nBut it\u2019s more than that. Hip-hop has become a dominant cultural force, driving conversations about music, literature, and entertainment forward. Cardi B and Common are movie stars. Young Thug has created a wake of imitators that span genres and sounds. Kendrick Lamar won a Pulitzer Prize for his 2018 album DAMN. And it has become a truly global phenomenon, crossing ethnic, linguistic, and geographical boundaries. The journey from the turntables of DJ Kool Herc to the addictive, meme-ified sounds of Megan Thee Stallion and Lil\u2019 Nas X was long, but hip hop is here to stay.\n\nWe asked 108 critics, artists, tastemakers, producers, and photographers from 15 different countries to name their personal top five hip-hop tracks of all time. There were more than 280 different songs named, a testament to the breadth and depth of the genre, and how the term \u2018greatest\u2019 can be interpreted in various ways.\n\nThe results are dominated by the so-called \u2018Golden Age\u2019 of hip-hop between the mid-80s and mid-90s, though there are some surprises from a more recent vintage with Kanye West\u2019s Pusha T-assisted Runaway taking 12th place. There was a remarkable lack of women in the Top 25; only Queen Latifah\u2019s 1993 hit \u201cU.N.I.T.Y.\u201d and Lauryn Hill\u2019s supremely catchy \u201cDoo Wop (That Thing)\u201d appear in the list. (You can read more on the dearth of female MCs in our list here.) Rapper\u2019s Delight, the track that arguably started it all, came in at number 14.\n\nThe full list of critics\u2019 picks is below. One more thing to add: The purpose of polls like these should be to generate debate as well as encourage discovery. And we are aware that no list can be definitive or will please everyone \u2013 so get in touch using the hashtag #GreatestHipHopSongs, and let us know what\u2019s missing.
