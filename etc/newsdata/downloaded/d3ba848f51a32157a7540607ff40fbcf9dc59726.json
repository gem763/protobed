But two key things call into question his version of how it went down \u2014 including Bolton\u2019s own comment.\n\nTrump tweeted around noon: \u201cI informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore \u2026 I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week.\u201d\n\n....I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2019\n\nBut just an hour before the announcement, the White House announced that Bolton would be appearing at a 1:30 p.m. news conference alongside Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. If Bolton was on his way out as of Monday night, why did the White House press office not seem to know about it at 11 a.m. Tuesday?\n\nAdding to the intrigue is Bolton\u2019s comments. His tweets Monday night and Tuesday didn\u2019t indicate anything had changed, and shortly after Trump\u2019s tweets, he chimed in by saying, \u201cI offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about it tomorrow.\u2019 \u201d\n\nI offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \"Let's talk about it tomorrow.\" \u2014 John Bolton (@AmbJohnBolton) September 10, 2019\n\nBolton went on to tell The Washington Post\u2019s Robert Costa: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, I resigned, having offered to do so last night.\u201d Pressed further, he said: \u201cI will have my say in due course. But I have given you the facts on the resignation. My sole concern is U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nBolton, who is apparently already talking to several media outlets, offered a fuller and more direct contradiction to the Daily Beast. After it quoted White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, who backed up Trump\u2019s account, Bolton responded in a text: \u201c[White House] press secretary statement is flatly incorrect.\u201d\n\nThose statements don\u2019t necessarily add up to a complete contradiction of what Trump said, but they are pretty close. Trump implied he initiated the resignation, but Bolton says he offered it. Bolton also suggests that Trump didn\u2019t make a final determination Monday night, even as Trump claims he had already decided and made the request.\n\nThe plot thickens as you look at Bolton\u2019s previous tweets. On Monday night and again Tuesday morning, Bolton tweeted remembrances of 9/11. That could simply be because this week is the 18th anniversary of the attacks, but they could also be read to suggest discord with Trump over the president\u2019s aborted plans to meet with the Taliban at Camp David.\n\nAs we reflect this week on the horrific 9/11 attack, it\u2019s important to remember how far we\u2019ve come in combatting radical Islamist terrorist groups but also how much work is left. We stand strong against regimes that sponsor terror & encourage violence against the US & our allies. \u2014 John Bolton (@AmbJohnBolton) September 10, 2019\n\nTrump announced this weekend that he canceled the secret planned meeting after 12 people, including an American, were killed in Afghanistan. Bolton is extremely hawkish on foreign policy and has generally abhorred negotiating with antagonistic foreign leaders. The Washington Post has reported that Bolton has been fighting against the negotiations, while Pompeo has been supportive of them.\n\nBolton certainly has reason to argue that he resigned rather than that he was effectively fired -- most notably, for his own personal pride. But it\u2019s highly unusual for former aides to so directly challenge Trump upon their departure, with the notable exception of former veterans affairs secretary David Shulkin, who maintained that Trump fired him rather than that he resigned.\n\nEven when departed aides have left Trump\u2019s White House or Cabinet on bad terms, they have generally been wary of even the perception of criticizing the president. Former defense secretary Jim Mattis, for instance, resigned in protest over Trump\u2019s later-aborted plan to completely withdraw from Syria. But even on a recent book tour, he has declined to disagree directly with Trump.\n\nBolton, though, has always been extremely outspoken about his foreign policy, rarely shying away from taking unpopular positions. In contrast to the growing number of yes-men and -women who surround Trump, Bolton\u2019s a true believer who logic suggests could ruffle some feathers in the weeks and months ahead \u2014 particularly if he views Trump as capitulating to America\u2019s enemies.\n\nA source close to Bolton just said this: \u201cSince Ambassador Bolton has been National Security advisor over the last 17 months, there have been no bad deals.\u201d \u2014 Eamon Javers (@EamonJavers) September 10, 2019\n\nA source close to Bolton was talking in the White House shortly after the news broke, playing up the idea that he had prevented \u201cbad deals\u201d from being made with the likes of the Taliban, North Korea and Iran, according to CNBC reporter Eamon Javers.\n\nIt will be a fascinating dynamic, judging by Bolton\u2019s willingness to engage on the matter less than an hour after his departure was tweeted.", "description": "Trump said he asked for Bolton's resignation Monday night and got it Tuesday morning.
