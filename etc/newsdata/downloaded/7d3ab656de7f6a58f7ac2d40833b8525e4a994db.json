The latest manifestation of Warhol\u2019s prediction is one Robert F. \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke. The former Texas Democratic congressman\u2019s 15 minutes of fame were up last November after he lost a U.S. Senate race to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, but apparently, no one thought to tell him.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke didn\u2019t need to find a real job after losing the Senate contest (in which he became a liberal media darling for nearly upsetting Mr. Cruz, whom they loathe) because he\u2019s married to the daughter of a billionaire, so this \u201c1 percenter\u201d by marriage instead opted to fail upward.\n\nDespite serving three terms in the House that were at best undistinguished, Mr. O\u2019Rourke surveyed a weak Democratic presidential field for 2020 and concluded that his closer-than-expected Senate contest entitled him to serious consideration for the party\u2019s nomination for president.\n\nDespite his Kennedy-esque (as in \u201cRobert F.\u201d) looks, Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s presidential bid has thus far failed to generate much traction. In polls, he\u2019s languishing among the also-rans in the field of 12 candidates who took part in the Oct. 15 Democratic presidential debate just outside of Columbus, Ohio, only narrowly ahead of novelty candidate Andrew Yang.\n\nIn a desperate bid to stand out in a crowded field all pandering, to a greater or lesser extent, to the party\u2019s far-left base, Mr. O\u2019Rourke has hitched his wagon to the most fanatical of the anti-Second Amendment gun grabbers with a call last month for a mandatory government \u201cbuyback\u201d of all AR-15 and AK-47 semi-automatic weapons owned by private citizens.\n\nCiting the mass shooting in Odessa and Midlands, Texas, two weeks earlier that left seven dead and 25 injured, Mr. O\u2019Rourke fired a rhetorical blunderbuss at a Sept. 12 Democratic debate. \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d he thundered. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow it to be used on fellow Americans anymore.\u201d\n\nThat Mr. O\u2019Rourke had not thought through the logistics \u2014 much less the legality \u2014 of his proposed ban and \u201cgovernment buyback\u201d of what he called \u201cweapons of war that have no place in our homes\u201d is self-evident.\n\nNever mind that the 99-plus-percent of Americans who own AR-15s and AK-47s and don\u2019t go on shooting rampages didn\u2019t buy them from the government in the first place. As such, how can the government buy them \u201cback?\u201d Semantics aside, what about owners who have no desire to sell them \u201cback\u201d at what the government decides to pay \u2014 or at any price, for that matter?\n\n\u201cI fully expect my fellow Americans to follow the law,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said, when asked about that on CNN on Oct. 16. Some would comply, of course, but it also raises what should be an obvious question: What would a President O\u2019Rourke do about those who don\u2019t \u2014 or won\u2019t \u2014 voluntarily surrender their AR-15s or AK-47s?\n\nWould he order armed federal agents to go door to door to confiscate those guns? Would he attempt to dragoon state and local law enforcement officials to assist in the police-state effort? What if the lawmen refused on constitutional grounds? And as CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota reminded Mr. O\u2019Rourke, mass shooters \u201cdon\u2019t follow the law, by definition.\u201d\n\nThe backlash to Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s ill-conceived pronuncimento was as swift as it was deserved. The owner of Alpha Dog Firearms in Tempe, Arizona, put the weapons on a \u201cBeto Special\u201d sale and reportedly sold out within four hours. The National Rifle Association awarded him the distinction of \u201cAR-15 Salesman of the Month\u201d adding, \u201cPossibly even of the year.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s anti-gun jihad calls to mind then-NRA President Charlton Heston\u2019s broadside at the gun rights group\u2019s convention in May 2000. Holding up a Revolutionary War-era flintlock rifle, Heston taunted that year\u2019s Democratic presidential nominee-to-be, Al Gore \u2014 and others of like mind \u2014 that if the government sought to confiscate his gun, it would have to be pried from his \u201ccold, dead hands.\u201d\n\nBut it was a conservative website that had the best riposte for Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s risible proposal. It has produced for sale a T-shirt that reads, \u201cNobody needs an AR-15? Nobody needs a whiny liberal either, yet here you are.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
