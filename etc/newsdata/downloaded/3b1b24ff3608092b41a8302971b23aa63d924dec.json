When the earthquake struck, my wife who is nine months pregnant, fell right in front of me.\n\nI saw women and children lying dead as I helped pull them out of collapsed houses.\n\nSome people shouted at me for taking pictures and their reactions were fair enough. One man told me to just help carry bricks rather than taking pictures - I did as he said, because he was right. Tears rolled down my face as I saw the bodies of the dead. Many historical sites have been reduced to debris and small earthquakes are still going on as I am typing.\n\nMy country is devastated and hurting, but people are standing up for each other.\n\nI am numb thinking about everything. Right now I can't enter my house and am taking refuge in a school ground behind my home. My prayers are with all the Nepalese people. I don't know exactly how many people are dead or trapped but with the first light I will go and help them. I hope this ends soon.", "description": "A powerful earthquake struck Nepal and sent tremors through northern India, killing thousands of people, touching off a deadly avalanche on Mount Everest and toppling a 19th-century tower in the capital Kathmandu.", "authors": ["Navesh Chitrakar", "Reuters Photographers"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ3yiGILJ1pZvLn141Giu74JAENvsYoeOOujzVRy9jCBZf_LkqUmcDze9hacmEnmEG2o-SqppCEGE4YEPtSkbW1NbnuC5c2p36g5Y3JjaZszN", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
