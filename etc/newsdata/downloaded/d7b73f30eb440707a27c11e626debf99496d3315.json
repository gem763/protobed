Jordan has spent his time attacking the impeachment proceedings, bizarrely suggesting that the Democrats have something to hide.\n\nOf course, when they were investigating Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, Pompeo and Jordan made \u201cnote of the disappointing fact that the administration did not cooperate with our committee\u2019s investigation from the very beginning. In fact, they obstructed our work from day one.\u201d\n\nDuring the Obama years, obstruction of Congress was a great concern among House Republicans, many of whom have become Trump\u2019s chief public defenders. Representative Doug Collins is the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, but when he was a member of the Oversight Committee in 2014, he defended congressional investigations as being \u201cnot about partisan politics, it\u2019s not about witch hunts, this is about the people.\u201d\n\nAnother one of Trump\u2019s fiercest defenders, Representative Mark Meadows, was singing a very different tune in 2014, when Republicans opened a barrage of investigations targeting the Obama administration in the run-up to the midterm elections saying, \u201creally what most Americans want is that justice is served.\u201d\n\nFive years later, a top diplomat was testifying that the president saw aide to Ukraine as a mechanism to extract a promise from a foreign leader to investigate one of his top political opponents. The acting head of the Office of Management and Budget is refusing to testify about why the White House chief of staff blocked the release of the aid. And Pompeo, Jordan, Meadows, and Collins aren\u2019t saying a word about obstructing Congress. They aren\u2019t on cable news defending our constitutionally protected system of checks-and-balances. They aren\u2019t demanding that members of the Executive who ignore Congress\u2019s oversight authority be held in contempt. They aren\u2019t calling for the creation of a special select-committee to investigate aide to Ukraine. Instead, they are burying their collective heads in the sand, hoping to avoid the smoke.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
