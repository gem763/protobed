Then his own brother quit, saying he was torn between family loyalty and the national interest.\n\nSaturday\u2019s resignation of Rudd - who backed remaining in the EU in the 2016 referendum when Britain voted 52%-48% to leave - over what she called the government\u2019s disproportionate focus on preparing for a no-deal Brexit has only heightened the sense of crisis.\n\nOn Sunday, Rudd denied she was accusing the government of lying over its efforts to negotiate a Brexit deal, saying she was just reporting what she had seen.\n\n\u201cI am saying that 80 to 90% of the work that I can see going on on the EU relationship is about preparation for no deal. It\u2019s about disproportion,\u201d she told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this resignation is to make the point that the Conservative Party at its best should be a moderate party that embraces people with different views of the EU.\u201d\n\nBut foreign minister Dominic Raab rebutted her view, describing continuing \u201cintense negotiations\u201d in Brussels, and emphasised that Johnson\u2019s government would not be deterred from what some describe as a hardline strategy on Brexit.\n\n\u201cI do also think that on some of these key issues, people need to understand, and the voters get it, that we\u2019ve got to keep to the plan,\u201d Raab told Sky News.\n\nBoth he and finance minister Sajid Javid also contradicted EU officials who have said Britain has yet to come up with new suggestions for changes to the Withdrawal Deal agreed by Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May.\n\nJohnson, Javid said, would go to an EU summit on Oct. 17 to try to secure the new deal. May failed in three attempts to get her deal ratified by parliament, where many lawmakers balked at the so-called Northern Irish backstop.\n\nJohnson\u2019s government has promised to get rid of the backstop, an insurance policy to prevent the return of a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. The EU says the backstop must stand.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, the prime minister will go to the council meeting on the 17th and 18th (of October), he\u2019ll be trying to strike a deal. He absolutely will not be asking for an extension in that meeting,\u201d Javid told the BBC.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson addresses the media outside Downing Street in London, Britain, September 2, 2019. REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT?\n\nBut France said Britain was failing to say what it wanted, and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said that, as things stood, an extension would not be granted even if Britain asked for one next month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very worrying. The British must tell us what they want,\u201d Le Drian told Europe 1 radio.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said if an agreement were to be reached between Britain and the rest of the EU, it would most likely happen at the October summit and not at a meeting with Johnson on Monday.\n\nBritain\u2019s political crisis escalated last week when parliament passed legislation to try to force Johnson to secure a Brexit extension if parliament has not approved either a deal or consented to leaving without agreement by Oct. 19.\n\nQueen Elizabeth is expected to sign it into law on Monday, but Johnson said on Friday he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than request such a delay - something opposition parties say could mean seeing the British prime minister breaking the law.\n\nRaab said the government would examine the Brexit delay bill \u201cto test to the limit what it does actually lawfully require\u201d.\n\nJohnson instead wants a new election on Oct. 15, but opposition parties, led by the Labour Party, said they could not trust him to stick to his word by holding the new vote before Britain is due to leave the EU.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\n\u201cUntil we\u2019ve ruled a no deal off the agenda, I can\u2019t risk, with Boris Johnson being in power, that he wouldn\u2019t somehow impose that on the country,\u201d Labour\u2019s finance policy chief, John McDonnell, told the BBC.\n\n\u201cSo we can get no deal off the agenda, then I\u2019d like a general election and part of that would be saying let\u2019s have a (second) referendum.\u201d", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson is sticking to his Brexit plan and will not seek a delay to Britain's departure from the European Union at a summit next month, two ministers said on Sunday despite the latest resignation from his government.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427559023&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870DA", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
