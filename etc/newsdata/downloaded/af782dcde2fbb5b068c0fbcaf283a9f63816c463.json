This made him the first openly gay CEO of a Fortune 500 company.\n\nIn an interview with People en Espa\u00f1ol published Thursday, the 58-year-old spoke about a range of topics related to sexual orientation and young people.\n\nDiscussing his 2014 coming out, he said: \"What was driving me was [that] I was getting notes from kids who were struggling with their sexual orientation. They were depressed. Some said [they] had suicidal thoughts. Some had been banished by their own parents and family.\n\n\"It weighed on me in terms of what I could do,\" he continued. \"Obviously I couldn't talk to each one individually that reached out, but you always know if you have people reaching out to you that there's many more that don't, that are just out there wondering whether they have a future or not, wondering whether life gets better \u2026 From there I really decided.\"\n\nThough Cook said he \"didn't worry\" about how Apple staff would react to his coming out, he did acknowledge worrying about the reaction \"outside of Apple,\" and noted that \"the world is still not friendly to gay or trans people in many countries but also within our country.\"\n\nIn a direct message to kids struggling with their sexual orientation, he said that \"life gets better, that you can have a great life filled with joy.\" He continued: \"Gay is not a limitation. It's a characteristic that I hope they view, like I do, that it's God's greatest gift.\"\n\nCook added that being gay gave him a lens into how other people think and feel. \"I'm not saying that I understand the trials and tribulations of every minority group, because I don't,\" he said. \"But I do understand for one of the groups. And to the degree that it helps give you a lens on how other people may feel, I think that's a gift in and of itself.\"\n\nCook's comments come at a challenging time for Apple and Cook, with the Apple CEO accused of pandering to Chinese state demands.\n\nEarlier this month, Apple removed an app from its App Store that let Hong Kong residents track police movements, with the app having received heavy criticism in Chinese state media the previous day.\n\nCook and Apple drew heavy criticism from US lawmakers including Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nIn a memo sent to Apple employees first obtained by Bloomberg, Cook defended his decision on the grounds that the app was being used to \"maliciously target individual officers for violence.\"\n\nMore recently, Cook accepted a chairman role at a prestigious Chinese university whose board members also include Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.", "description": "In an interview with People magazine, Tim Cook discussed coming out in 2014 and sent a message to children struggling with their sexual orientation.", "authors": ["Charlie Wood"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db2d0cedee019611d72be23?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
