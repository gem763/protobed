Foxconn picked Wisconsin over struggling Illinois and other states for the proposed site of a $10 billion LCD panel factory that will employ up to 13,000 people. These mega-projects don\u2019t happen every day, so Foxconn\u2019s decision hurts because job growth is the only way to solve Illinois\u2019 fiscal crisis: More jobs means more tax revenue.\n\nWhat really stings, though, is how the winning site is just across the state line in southeast Wisconsin. It\u2019s as if Foxconn settled on the Midwest as a location and then decided: We want to be as near as possible to Illinois without actually being there.\n\nFoxconn Chairman Terry Gou gave an interview to Steve Jagler, the business editor of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Gou gave Jagler eight reasons why Foxconn chose Wisconsin. Two of them were \u2013 literally \u2013 proximity to Illinois: First, Wisconsin is conveniently located in the central U.S., \u201cclose to Chicago, a global hub,\u201d the Journal Sentinel reported. Second, Wisconsin has the transportation and logistics to accommodate Foxconn\u2019s growth, and is \u2026 near O\u2019Hare International Airport. Feel free to smack your forehead.\n\nCNBC: In Weary Wisconsin Town, a Billionaire-Fueled Revival\n\nWhen Diane Hendricks sees something she doesn\u2019t like here, she buys it.\n\nA bankrupt country club. A half-empty mall. Abandoned buildings. The rusting foundry down by the river.\n\nBeloit used to be a town that made papermaking machines and diesel engines. Ms. Hendricks thinks it can be a place where start-ups create the next billion-dollar idea, and she is remaking the town to fit her vision. She can do so because she is the second-richest woman in the United States, behind only Marian Ilitch of Little Caesars Pizza.\n\n\u201cI see old buildings, and I see an opportunity for putting things in them,\u201d says Ms. Hendricks, 70, who got her start fixing up houses here as a single mother and made her billions selling roofing felt, copper gutters and cement with her late husband, Ken.\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel: UW System office seeks charter school proposals; Milwaukee market may be tapped out\n\nMore than two years after it was created as part of the state\u2019s 2015-\u201917 budget, the University of Wisconsin System\u2019s Office of Educational Opportunity is taking steps to authorize its first charter schools.\n\nThe office issued two requests for proposals this week, one for a pilot for an addiction recovery school, which could be located anywhere in the state; and another for potential charter schools in Madison and Milwaukee.\n\nGary Bennett, the former chief of staff for Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills) who was tapped last year to lead the office, said some municipalities and Cooperative Educational Service Agency, or CESA, networks have voiced interest in the recovery school.\n\nAs for the traditional charters, if there is interest at all, he said, it\u2019s more likely to be in Madison than Milwaukee.", "description": "Chicago Tribune opinion: The next Foxconn and Illinois: Here\u2019s why .09/02/2019 3:19:38AM EST.", "authors": ["Watchdog News", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
