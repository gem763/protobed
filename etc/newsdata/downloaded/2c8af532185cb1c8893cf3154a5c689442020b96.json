You will hear a great deal from Donald Trump directly, for there is no better witness to his character than his own words and no better evidence of the danger he poses than his own conduct,' reads the back cover of 'A Warning' - the forth-coming tome by the same person that wrote last year's 'resistance' op-ed in The New York Times.\n\nThe author was frequently in meetings with the president and will recount specific conversations with him, Axios reports.\n\nThe author, who plans to keep his or her identity private, has extensive notes that will be shared in 'A Warning,' which is out November 19.\n\nAnonymous author was in many meetings with President Trump and will reveal those conversations in tell-all book 'A Warning'\n\nThe book, written by the author of last year's 'resistance' op-ed, is out Nov. 19\n\nBack cover image and text from 'A Warning'\n\nIt is unclear whether or not the author remains a government employee.\n\nBut the person calls on others in the administration to speak out about President Trump.\n\n'The truth about the president must be spoken, not after Americans have stood in the voting booth to consider whether to give him another term and not after he has departed office. Hopefully others will remedy the error of silence and choose to speak out,' the back cover reads.\n\nThe author has agreed to at least one interview that will come out around the time of the book's publication but details about the sit-down - including the format and who will conduct the interview - have not been revealed.\n\n'A Warning' is 'an unprecedented behind-the-scenes portrait of the Trump presidency,' according to the unnamed author's literary agent.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham slammed the forth-coming tome.\n\n'Takes a lot of conviction and bravery to write a whole book anonymously,' she told DailyMail.com earlier this week.\n\nThe author plans to 'substantially' donate royalties 'to non-profit organizations that focus on government accountability and on supporting those who stand up for the truth in repressive countries around the world,' according to a press release.\n\nOne organization identified by Matt Latimer of Javelin - one of the author's agents - is the White House Correspondents Association, which hosts a famed annual gala dinner where comedians and historians have excoriated Trump since before he ran for president.\n\nLatimer told CNN that the author 'refused the chance at a seven figure advance.'\n\nAmazon is pre-selling the book for $30.00. The Kindle e-book version is priced at $15.99.\n\nLatimer and Keith Urbahn, co-agents for 'A Warning,' also represented former FBI Director James Comey and former Trump aide Cliff Sims in their tell-all book deals.\n\nA source with knowledge of the publishing deal said Tuesday that Javelin has '100% confidence' in the writer.\n\nThe author of the New York Times column, published in September 2018, was identified at the time only as a 'senior official' from inside the Trump administration, a broad category that became the basis of a guessing game inside the capital beltway.\n\n'There obviously will be those who want the author to reveal themselves publicly, but there are good reasons for that not to happen,' Latimer told The Washington Post.\n\n'The author feels their identity is almost irrelevant because there is scarcely a sentiment expressed in this book that is not shared by numerous others who have served and continue to serve this administration at its highest levels.'\n\nThe president attacked the author last year, suggesting alternatively that the op-ed might be an act of treason, and that the author might be a fictitious creation of the Times rather than a real person.\n\n'Does the so-called \u201cSenior Administration Official\u201d really exist, or is it just the Failing New York Times with another phony source?' he tweeted at the time.\n\n'If the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist, the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!'\n\nAn hour earlier Trump had tweeted a single word: 'TREASON?'\n\nAuthor of 'A Warning' plans to keep their identity private\n\nTrump blasted the unnamed author after the op-ed sent Washington into a dizzying guessing game\n\nThe president tweeted a single word to sum up his leanings about the essay last year\n\nThe Times op-ed described the president as 'impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective' in the way he manages the government, and says the author is part of an organized 'resistance' whose goal is 'to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Trump's more misguided impulses until he is out of office.'\n\nDuring a White House event with a group of sheriffs at the time of the op-ed's publication, Trump said the writer was 'probably... failing and probably here for all the wrong reasons.'\n\nSarah Sanders, then the White House press secretary, said in a statement at the time that the essay was 'pathetic, reckless, and selfish' and challenged the Times to 'issue an apology.'\n\n'This is just another example of the liberal media's concerted effort to discredit the President,' she said then.", "description": "The anonymous author of the upcoming tell-all book about Donald Trump will reveal his or her private conversations with the president along with conduct that shows Trump is a 'danger' to the country.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/14/20179906-0-image-a-14_1572008563120.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
