Elizabeth Warren have gained support since the summer in their fight for the Democratic presidential nomination and are beginning to separate themselves from the rest of the party\u2019s sprawling 2020 field, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds.\n\nMr. Biden was the top choice of 31% of Democratic primary voters, while Ms. Warren was favored by 25% in the poll, which was conducted after the party\u2019s third primary debate, in Houston, last week. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was the only other candidate with double-digit support, at 14%.\n\nMr. Biden and Ms. Warren were the only candidates whose support grew meaningfully since a July survey. But measures of voter enthusiasm for Ms. Warren have risen during the year while declining for Mr. Biden.\n\nA few of the Democratic presidential candidates had big moments during the third debate.

In a sign of her support, Ms. Warren attracted 20,000 people to a rally in New York City\u2019s Washington Square Park Monday night.\n\nThe survey underscored Mr. Biden\u2019s strength among voters age 50 and older, as well as among African-Americans, two voting groups that often play influential roles in Democratic primaries.\n\nRepublican pollster Bill McInturff noted that only three contenders have double-digit support even after Democratic voters have been exposed to a large field through televised debates and other media events.\n\n\u201cThe race isn\u2019t getting broader. There aren\u2019t more people in the mix. There are fewer people,\u201d said Mr. McInturff, who conducted the survey with Democrat Jeff Horwitt.\n\nPeter Hart, a Democratic pollster who also worked on the survey, cautioned that past presidential campaigns have often fluctuated ahead of the first nominating contests. \u201cWhat we see in September isn\u2019t what we see in December,\u201d Mr. Hart said. The first 2020 contest, in Iowa, will be held next February.\n\nMs. Warren struggled with fundraising and lagged behind some opponents at the start of her candidacy. But enthusiasm for her has surged in recent months. The 70% of Democratic primary voters who said they were enthusiastic about or comfortable with Ms. Warren compared with 57% who said so in March.\n\nDemocratic enthusiasm has declined, by contrast, for Mr. Biden. The 64% who said they were enthusiastic about or comfortable with him in the new survey compared with 73% who said so in March.\n\nSome 62% said they were enthusiastic about or comfortable with Mr. Sanders\u2019s candidacy. Some 37% said they had reservations about him or were uncomfortable with him, compared with 35% who said so of Mr. Biden and 21% who said so of Ms. Warren.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Which 2020 presidential candidate has caught your attention in recent weeks?

Eleven percent said Mr. Biden was their second choice.\n\nThe Journal/NBC News poll surveyed 506 registered voters who said they would vote in a Democratic caucus or primary. The poll was conducted from Sept. 13-16 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.36 percentage points.\n\nBoth Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren have built upon their support compared with the Journal/NBC News poll in July, when Mr. Biden received 26% and Ms. Warren was at 19%. Mr. Sanders was at 13% in that July poll.\n\nThe latest poll underscored the challenge for the long slate of Democratic candidates who are trying to break into the top tier.\n\nThe survey found weaker support than in July, for example, for California Sen. Kamala Harris. She had the backing of 13% of Democratic primary voters in the prior survey, conducted shortly after she drew wide attention for confronting Mr. Biden over racial issues in a televised debate. In the new survey, she registered 5% support.\n\nMr. Buttigieg received 7% support in the new survey, while entrepreneur Andrew Yang had 4%. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey garnered 2% each.\n\nSeven candidates registered at 1%: Former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro.\n\nMr. Biden has sought to tie himself closely to former President Obama, defending their administration\u2019s signature health law and running advertising that emphasizes the two men\u2019s partnership on economic and social issues while in the White House.\n\nThe survey shows Mr. Obama as overwhelmingly popular within the party, with 90% holding a positive view of the former president. That compares with 64% who have a positive view of former President Bill Clinton.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s presidency receives high marks in the poll, with 78% saying they are satisfied that he did as much as possible to address the issues facing the country. Twenty percent said they were unsatisfied with Mr. Obama\u2019s record.\n\nThe poll also offers a window into the party\u2019s ideological divide as it seeks to define itself after the Obama years.\n\nSlightly more than half of Democratic primary voters\u201456%\u2014want a nominee who will propose larger-scale policies that would cost more and might be harder to pass into law but would bring major change. Ms. Warren is the leading choice for presidential nominee among this group.\n\nForty percent want someone who proposes smaller-scale policies that would cost less and might be easier to pass into law but would bring less change to these issues. Mr. Biden is the leading choice among this group.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s more centrist views have faced a critique from liberals in the race such as Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, who have pressed for a more expansive role of government in the nation\u2019s health-care and tax system.\n\nWrite to Ken Thomas at ken.thomas@wsj.com", "description": "Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren are beginning to separate from the rest of the Democratic 2020 field, with the former vice president earning 31% support and the Massachusetts senator at 25% in the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.", "authors": ["Ken Thomas", "Ken.Thomas Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108026/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
