I don't know if it's true. I can't verify it, but if it's as it came out in the media, that a lawyer says Guzman wants his wealth to be given to Mexico's indigenous communities, I think it's good,\" he said.\n\n\"Also, we have started a process because we want everything that's confiscated in the United States from criminals or suspected criminals from Mexico is returned to Mexico,\" he added.\n\nMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in Mexico City, July 15, 2019. Reuters\n\nLopez Obrador, a veteran leftist who took office in December, gave few details on the initiative beyond saying that his government would undertake \"all necessary legal actions\" to go after such money in the United States due to Mexicans.\n\nThe initiative may raise eyebrows in the administration of US President Donald Trump, who ran for office vowing to close the border to criminals and drugs from Mexico, and accused the country of taking advantage of the United States on trade.\n\nIn July, US authorities sought a court order requiring Guzman to forfeit $12.7 billion made from his drug-running career after his conviction this year for racketeering and drug trafficking crimes.\n\nLawyer Gonzalez Meza told Reuters that while Guzman, 62, had never admitted to having earned the billions, he was of the view that whatever money the US authorities were referring to should be sent back to Mexico and distributed there.\n\n\"He says, well, if that money exists ... that money does not belong to the United States; it belongs to Mexico,\" he said, arguing that because the cultivation and harvesting of the drugs had taken place in Mexico, the proceeds belonged there.\n\nGuzman, who is being held in a maximum security prison in Colorado, put forward the idea during phone calls with his mother and sisters in August, Gonzalez Meza said. \"And he asks for President Lopez Obrador to allocate (the money) to the indigenous communities,\" he added.\n\nMexico's indigenous population is among the poorest in the country, and a cause close to Lopez Obrador's heart.\n\nIn the 1970s, the president worked among the indigenous people of his native state of Tabasco in southern Mexico. He has vowed to give priority to the poor in his administration.\n\n(Reporting by Dave Graham; editing by Richard Chang)", "description": "Mexico's president welcomed a proposal to give Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman's alleged fortune to the country's indigenous people.", "authors": ["Dave Graham"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7153522e22af6e716f961c-2560-1280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
