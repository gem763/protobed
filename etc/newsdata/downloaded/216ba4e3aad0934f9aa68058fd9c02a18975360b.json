The move should make the digital streamer even more sticky as its competitors attempt to take share away from the fast-growing company.\n\nIn this article we'll look at the terms of the deal and what it could mean for the long-term growth prospects of ROKU.\n\nTerms\n\nRoku entered into an agreement to acquire Dataxu for $150 million in cash and stock. Roku CEO, Anthony Wood, said the \"acquisition of Dataxu will accelerate our ad platform while also helping our content partners monetize their inventory even more effectively.\u201d\n\nDataxu offers marketers the ability to automate the bidding process with software they can use to manage their ad campaigns across a variety of digital platforms.\n\nRoku management said the acquisition will be complementary to its existing ad platform, which will allow users to plan, acquire and optimize ad spend with OTT and TV providers.\n\nThe boards of both companies have approved the deal, which is expected to close by the end of 2019.\n\nPotential for Roku\n\nRoku noted in the announcement that traditional TV generates over $70 billion in ad revenue, citing Magna Global. While OTT makes up 29 percent of overall TV viewing, it only accounts for three percent of the total TV ad budgets.\n\nThe company believes that by adding robust automated media buying options, it will \"unlock more advertising investment into OTT.\" With that being the probable outcome, it positions Roku for significant long-term growth as it captures more of the ad spend.\n\nIn June, comScore said that Roku is, as of June 2019, the market leader in ad-supported streaming hours. At the end of June it also had over 30.5 million active accounts.\n\nThis comes at an opportune time for Roku, as it has been increasingly transitioning from its Player segment being the primary driver of revenue, to its Platform segment producing the most sales.\n\nThis is of course important because the Player segment, which represents the hardware side of the business, has limitations after market saturation. Platform on the other hand has a lot of room for growth, as that segment includes revenue from sources including licensing and advertising.\n\nPlatform generates revenue from subscriptions and advertising, with advertising having a lot of long-term potential for sustainable growth.\n\nThe company offers ads within the videos, on its screen saver, and on its home screen, providing various touch points to the viewers.\n\nTaking into account in the last quarter the Platform segment of Roku represented over two-thirds of overall sales, and advertising is the largest part of that segment, it's apparent that this is a part of the company that has a lot of legs to it.\n\nRevenue from Platform jumped to $167 million, up 86 percent year-over-year. Total revenue reached $250.1 million, confirming the increasing importance of ad revenue to Roku's performance.\n\nThe major challenge for Roku is in regard to competitors like Comcast offering alternative hardware such as the Xfinity Flex box. The idea is that if that is how it plays out, other competitors will follow suit, threatening the growth potential of Roku.\n\nWhile it definitely could slow down Roku, the company does have a strong connection with users via its Roku TV, which represent over a third of all smart TV sales in the U.S. That should allow it to remain sticky in that part of the business.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Roku (ROKU) announced it has acquired ad-management platform Dataxu for $150 million.
