I\u2019m Karina.\"\n\nThat was a text message Dr. Zyad Younan received in late 2013.\n\nThe wealthy cardiologist from New Jersey had met an attractive woman one night at a restaurant six months earlier when they were both out separately with friends. They chatted briefly and exchanged numbers that night. But Younan hadn\u2019t heard from her until now, months later.\n\nSo, he said he was a little skeptical.\n\n\"I said, 'Well, can you remind me?\u2019\" Younan told \"20/20.\" \"She was like, 'Oh we met at that restaurant. \u2026 I\u2019m studying to become a nurse, and I really am looking for a nice guy and I would love to go out to dinner with you.\u2019\"\n\nWatch the full story on \"20/20\" TONIGHT at 10 p.m. ET on ABC.\n\nABC News\n\nYounan, who has never been married and has no children, said he agreed to take her out to dinner and arranged to meet Karina at a restaurant in New York City\u2019s West Village neighborhood.\n\nWhat he didn\u2019t know, as Karina Pascucci told \u201c20/20,\u201d was that although she had indeed met Younan previously, the person actually texting him about dinner was Samantha Barbash, a former stripper who was running an elaborate scam, along with another former stripper named Roselyn \u201cRosie\u201d Keo and their team of women, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nOver texts with Younan, Barbash was posing as Pascucci, one of her recruits.\n\n\"Samantha had texted him\u2026using my picture,\" Pascucci told \"20/20,\"\n\nDuring the Great Recession, the clientele at New York City\u2019s gentleman's clubs stopped spending like they used to, and these women started looking for new legitimate ways to make money.\n\nAuthorities said Barbash recruited beautiful club dancers and workers to lure wealthy men back into Manhattan\u2019s gentleman\u2019s clubs, where they would get their \"marks\" to spend as much money as possible and run up enormous credit card charges. Acting essentially as club promoters, the women would walk away with a cut of what the men spent -- all perfectly legal.\n\nBut it was under the guise of promotion that the women\u2019s scam took shape and crossed the line into something illegal.\n\nBarbash arranged for Pascucci, who worked as a waitress and a massage girl at one of the clubs, to go on the date with Younan. Pascucci said she was given a storyline to follow and was coached to say she was a nursing student.\n\nBy agreeing to this dinner date in 2013, Younan had just set himself up.\n\nA dinner date with a bizarre end\n\nOn the night that they had planned to meet up, Younan said he texted Pascucci to let her know he had arranged for a friend and his wife to meet them for a double date.\n\n\"And she was like, 'OK, you know, I\u2019m running a little late. You know, I wanted to spend some time alone with you,'\" said Younan. \"And I was like, 'Just, don\u2019t worry, just come.' So she showed up over two hours late.\"\n\nWhen Pascucci finally arrived, the other couple was finishing up their meal and they left shortly after. Younan and Pascucci stayed and shared some wine. Then Younan said he excused himself to go to the men\u2019s room. When he returned to the table, he drained the last few sips of wine left in his glass.\n\n\"I started feeling warm, flushy and [my] vision was a little blurry and cloudy,\u201d Younan said. \u201cI really didn\u2019t think twice\u2026and then I don\u2019t remember much after that.\"\n\nThe next thing he knew, Younan said he was waking up the next morning in bed alone and had no idea what had happened after the restaurant. He said Pascucci had left him a note thanking him \"for an unbelievable time.\"\n\n\u201cThat could happen when you drink too much alcohol. It's called blacking out,\" Pascucci said. \u201cHe was very intoxicated.\u201d\n\nWhen Younan texted her asking what had happened that night, he said she told him that he had too much to drink but that they \"had a great time together\" and she wanted to see him again.\n\nYounan decided to meet up with Pascucci a second time, and then, he said, \"I went to the bathroom and then I signed the bill and then I don\u2019t remember the events.\"\n\nAgain, Younan said he texted Pascucci the next day, who told him once again that he had too much to drink but that they had a great time together. On both occasions, Younan said that he woke up with his wallet, his credit card and his bearings, and didn\u2019t suspect anything.\n\n\"I was na\u00efve and foolish,\" Younan said. \"I believed her, I trusted her. \u2026 I mean who hasn\u2019t done a stupid thing or two for a beautiful girl in life.\"\n\nYounan agreed to a third date with Pascucci.\n\n\"He had texted me almost religiously and I kind of felt bad,\" Pascucci said. \"And he said he had gotten concert tickets.\"\n\nFor their third date, Younan took her to a Van Morrison concert at Madison Square Garden. Right away, he said there seemed to be an issue.\n\n\"All she kept asking was for wine,\" Younan said. \"But at Van Morrison concerts, once the concert starts, they don\u2019t serve alcohol.\"\n\n\"That was a dreadful night,\" Pascucci said. \"There was no alcohol that night, so I actually had to talk to him. \u2026 Sometimes you get tired of pretending and fake laughing all night, so that was rough. \u2026 It's emotionally draining to do this.\"\n\nABC News\n\nAfter the concert, Younan said they decided to go out for drinks with some of Pascucci's friends. He said he remembered drinking the last half-glass of wine at the end of the night. But once again, the next thing he knew, he said he was waking up in bed alone with little memory of the night before. But he found a voicemail that gave him a clue.\n\n\"There was a message left by American Express,\" he said. \"They said, there was excessive charges on your credit card. It was close to $100,000\u2026on a place called Robert's Steakhouse. 'Can you please call us?\u2019\"\n\nWhile the charges were from Robert\u2019s, the steakhouse is affiliated with Scores, a famous gentleman\u2019s club in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood.\n\n\u201cI had never been to Scores,\u201d Younan said. \u201cI had never had an account with Scores. I had never stepped foot into Scores\u2026 and American Express knew I had no history with that vendor.\u201d\n\n\"[American Express] said it was three separate nights, and then I put it together\u2026 It was every time I went out to dinner with her,\" he continued. \u201cAnd I even saw the receipts. They were all forged receipts and they weren\u2019t even my own handwriting.\u201d\n\nYounan said he confronted Pascucci, who \"turned immediately red\" when he asked her about the charges and then she tried to blamed it on other people in her circle.\n\n\"And I told her, 'You're nothing but a thief, you're nothing but a swindler... I don't want to see you, I don't want to talk to you ever again,'\" he said.\n\nPlay\n\nPascucci told \"20/20\" she was \"definitely apologetic\" after Younan confronted her.\n\n\"I definitely 100% felt bad, because I didn't even know his bill was that high until I had found out from [the] Scores' manager and from Samantha,\" Pascucci said.\n\nAmerican Express launched an investigation and agreed with Younan that the charges were fraudulent. But it turned out that Scores had Younan on its surveillance footage inside the club, which Younan said he didn\u2019t remember setting foot in.\n\nWhat Pascucci, Rosie Keo, Barbash and others involved in the scam didn't know was that by the time Younan was disputing the Scores charges, the New York City Police Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration were already onto them.\n\nAgents and detectives had interviewed other victims and suspected the women were luring and then drugging their marks. Another woman, whose name has never been revealed, had given investigators a detailed road map.\n\nThe sting operation that almost brought the women down in one night\n\nIn November 2013, the same month that Younan took Pascucci on those three dates, the NYPD and DEA set up a sting operation at the Gansevoort Hotel, a luxury hotel in Manhattan\u2019s trendy meatpacking district. They rented a room, wiretapped it with audio and video recording devices, set up a surveillance shop next door and had an undercover DEA agent pose as a rich man sitting alone at the hotel bar in order to make him an attractive target.\n\n\"We did our investigation ahead of time...so we knew they were going to come to this...high-end hotel bar,\" the undercover agent told \"20/20.\"\n\nOn that night, after about an hour-and-a-half of the undercover agent waiting at the bar, one of the women in on the scam approached him, asked him if he wanted to party and then accompanied the agent to his hotel room.\n\nUnbeknownst to her, the room next door to his was full of detectives and DEA agents watching and listening to everything.\n\nThe undercover agent said he and the woman had bought drinks at the bar and she brought them up to the room. He knew \u201cthat these drinks would possibly be drugged,\" he said. Then the undercover agent said he pretended to pass out as if the drug cocktail had been too strong for him.\n\nPascucci, who was downstairs, said Keo called her and told her to join her in the room.\n\n\"I actually wasn't supposed to be there that night,\" Pascucci said. \"I was home in my apartment by myself sleeping, and Rosie called me...she told me to wait downstairs and she went up [to the room] with another girl -- another dancer.\"\n\nABC News\n\nWhen she walked in, Pascucci said she saw \"a gentleman on the bed passed out.\"\n\nSurveillance video and audio obtained exclusively by ABC News captured the frenzy.\n\n\"They were trying to wake me up using various methods,\" the undercover agent said. \"They grabbed a beer from the hotel fridge...and they had me drink that.\"\n\nOne of the women is heard asking, \"Did you give him something?\" Another woman is heard saying, \"I gave him a bump of blow and he fell asleep. He was like dead.\" And then another one is heard saying, \"I've never seen anyone go to sleep after a bump.\"\n\n\"It just didn't make sense to me,\" Pascucci said. \"I had went up to him and I had taken his pulse...he was breathing completely normal...I knew he wasn't blacked out. I knew he wasn't sick. His heart was fine.\n\nThe undercover agent was acting the entire time, but the other agents listening in the room next door started to worry that he had actually been drugged.\n\n\"There was a point where...the girls had crawled on the bed [and] they had a wet cloth and it looked like they put the cloth over his mouth,\" said DEA Agent JC Mannick, of the lead investigators on the case.\n\n\"I had actually several times given the order to move in,\" said Eric Triana, the assistant special agent in charge of the DEA\u2019s New York field office, who oversaw the probe. \"And it was only a split second [later] that [another investigator] would stop them, stop me, and say, 'No, no, not yet, he just gave a signal.'\"\n\nThe undercover agent said he shook his leg to let his counterparts next door know he was fine. Meanwhile, the surveillance footage showed the women seeming to grow more agitated. They started slapping his face to try to wake him up.\n\n\"We were just hoping the girls would take his credit card and leave and go swipe it,\" Detective Danny Politoski said.\n\nUntil that moment, investigators didn\u2019t realize that these women needed to get the men into a strip club, where they would be recorded on the club\u2019s cameras, so there could be no doubt they were on the premises when their credit cards were charged.\n\nKeo told \u201c20/20\u201d that the scam usually worked because a lot of the men they targeted \"had wives and high-power positions.\"\n\n\"They didn't want any problems. They just wanted to pay the bill and move on,\" Keo said. \"We would tell [our marks], 'Listen, it's a losing battle. Just give it up. We have you on camera.'\"\n\nBut the women couldn\u2019t rouse the undercover agent. The DEA\u2019s surveillance video inside the hotel room showed the women, in their desperation, started to get physical with the agent, grabbing and groping him, trying to get him on his feet.\n\n\"I felt like they were like vampires hovering over me,\" the undercover agent told ABC News. \"My blood was the credit card. They needed to get me to this strip bar with my credit card to do their business.\"\n\n\"It got a little intrusive,\" Politoski said. \"It was getting to the point where they weren't leaving...they just wanted him to get to this club...so we kind of came to the decision that this is going to go on all night.\"\n\nTriana then had some agents pose as hotel security and knock on the door. When they came in, they asked the women if there was a problem and if the man on the bed needed an ambulance. The women told them no.\n\n\"They had no regard for his health -- if he was dead or alive,\" Politoski said.\n\nIn the end, the agents were not able to make any arrests that night because the women never ran the agent\u2019s card. But Triana said the operation wasn't a failure because they had gathered incriminating evidence. They had recorded these women talking about drugging their mark, and they said they had retrieved the agent\u2019s glass with the spiked drink and sent it to a DEA lab to find out if the women were drugging their marks, and if so, what the women were drugging their marks with to cause the memory loss. It was critical to their case.\n\nThey had recorded these women talking about drugging their mark. Detectives had also retrieved the undercover agent\u2019s glass that held the spiked drink and sent it to a DEA lab to find out if the women were drugging their marks and with which substances to cause memory loss. This was critical to their case.\n\nAccording to detectives, the lab determined the women were using a mixture of MDMA, commonly known as \u201cMolly,\u201d and ketamine, or \"Special K,\" which is used for general anesthesia.\n\nThe doctor decides to help law enforcement bring down the scammers\n\nIn April 2014, Scores sued Younan in an attempt to force him to pay the $135,000 in bills charged during those three nights. The lawsuit prompted screaming headlines in the New York City newspapers.\n\nBut the women had picked the wrong mark when they targeted Younan. He was ready for a fight and refused to pay for charges he said he never authorized.\n\nHowever, when NYPD detectives contacted him after running down lists of men who had high New York City strip club bills, Younan said he was skeptical, thinking he was being set up by Scores\u2019 pretending to be law enforcement.\n\n\"I ID\u2019d myself as a detective at the NYPD [and told him] we're investigating a case of fraud credit card charges,\" Politoski said. \"He was definitely apprehensive at first. \u2026 I asked him, 'Can we meet, you know, we\u2019ll meet in a public place.' We agreed upon a hotel lobby in New Jersey.\"\n\n\"At this point in time, I don\u2019t want to talk to anyone, and I\u2019m like, 'You know, who\u2019s calling me?'\" Younan said. \"I just didn\u2019t want to deal with anyone at that point.\"\n\nWhen Politoski and Mannick finally met Younan for their first interview, Politoski said it took a while for Younan to open up to them. But once Politoski explained that they had heard stories like his before, he said, \"that made him feel better.\"\n\n\"When I told [Politoski] my story...he believed me right away,\" Younan said. \"[We] started working together and trying to help with the case.\"\n\nYounan said he shared with detectives the various text messages, emails and voicemails he had exchanged with Pascucci and Scores.\n\nWeeks later, Younan\u2019s name was plastered across the New York City tabloids when Scores filed a lawsuit against him. Yet, he continued to keep quiet about working with law enforcement, hoping they would soon take action.\n\nWhen the crime ring came to an end\n\nWithin a few months, the authorities had enough evidence to make arrests.\n\nIn June 2014, Keo, Barbash, Pascucci and a fourth woman, Marsi Rosen, were arrested, along with Carmine Vitolo, the manager of a different gentleman's club, RoadHouse NYC, in Queens.\n\nU.S. Dept. of Justice\n\nBarbash, Keo, Pascucci and Rosen were charged with conspiracy, grand larceny and other charges.\n\n\"The day of my arrest, they come to my house early in the morning, and I was taken in handcuffs,\" Keo said. \"It's like, 'Oh my God, the whole world -- everybody -- knows what I did.' ... All types of emotions are running through you. ... I think I was shocked.\"\n\nPascucci said she was at work at a clothing store in Manhattan when three DEA agents showed up to arrest her.\n\nU.S. Dept. of Justice\n\n\"So when they had come to get me -- to apprehend me -- I was really surprised,\" she said. \"When you get arrested, the whole world goes black and everything just goes silent.\"\n\nEventually, the four women and Vitolo all accepted plea deals. Barbash pleaded guilty to conspiracy, assault and grand larceny in exchange for five years' probation. Keo pleaded guilty to grand larceny and assault.\n\nVitolo pleaded guilty to petit larceny and was sentenced to three years' probation.\n\nU.S. Dept. of Justice\n\nPascucci and Rosen pleaded guilty to conspiracy and grand larceny and served 16 weekends in New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail complex and five years probation.\n\n\"I definitely feel responsible for just luring people in and, you know, manipulating them,\" Pascucci said.\n\nIn July 2014, Younan countersued Scores, alleging in his lawsuit that he had been drugged and should not be responsible for charges he never authorized, as well as that Scores and the women had later defamed him.\n\nAlmost four years later, in January 2018, a judge ruled in Younan\u2019s favor on not having to pay the six-figure Scores tab, ruling that the charges were the result of \u201ccriminal conduct\u201d on the part of Barbash, Keo, Pascucci, Rosen and other women involved in the scam. Younan\u2019s lawsuit against the strip club and the women was dismissed.\n\nNone of the clubs where the scam took place were charged. Scores declined repeated requests for comment from ABC News.\n\nThere is another element to this saga, though.\n\nKeo, Barbash and Pascucci\u2019s true story was the inspiration for the new movie \"Hustlers,\" starring Cardi B., Jennifer Lopez, Constance Wu, Keke Palmer and Lili Reinhart. \u201cHustlers\u201d opens in theaters on Friday.\n\n\"I\u2019m sure in the movie they\u2019re all going to be like super heroes. The truth is, in this story\u2026these women were running a criminal enterprise -- period,\" said New York Daily News columnist Linda Stasi.\n\nBarbash, who also says she's working on a book, declined ABC News' request for an interview and declined to comment except to say she wanted to tell Keo, \"Make the money, don't let the money make you.\" Barbash told the New York Post in April that she plans to sue STX Entertainment, the production company behind \"Hustlers.\"\n\nKeo said she is working on a memoir to tell her story in her own words.\n\n\u201cPeople make mistakes,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you do does not define who you are. It's what you learn from it. It's what you do after it. It's who you become later on.\u201d\n\nPascucci is working on her associate\u2019s degree in criminal psychology and also wants to write a book about her experience at a later date.\n\nReflecting on it now, Younan said the ordeal has affected him \"tremendously.\"\n\n\"I'm not a trusting as I used to be. ... But yeah, I always stand up for what's right...and someone had to stand up and stop it,\" Younan said, \"They need to be accountable for their responsibilities and their actions.\"", "description": "Dr. Zyad Younan was a key witness in the case against the real-life", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/ht_barbash_le_190911_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
