We have talked about this repeatedly with sensitive people in Ivory Coast during our campaigns by talking about the abuse of migrants and the abuse of women in particular.\n\n\u201cWe have made a big issue of the fact that it is high time that, in our country, we open our eyes and we understand that irregular migration is not only about the tragedy of deaths, it is about other tragedies.\u201d\n\nThe revelations have brought yet more scrutiny on a country already in crisis. Demonstrations sprung up outside Libyan embassies in France, Mali, Guinea and other sub-Saharan African states. Burkina Faso recalled its ambassador to Libya, while the UN General Assembly president Peter Thomson condemned the \u201cappalling\u201d slave auctions.", "description": "Migrants returning to the Ivory Coast to be repatriated reveal the horrors of the migrant slave trade.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/406429/1000x563_406429.jpg", "published_at": "2017-11-21"}
