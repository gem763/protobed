Oil May Jump as Much as $10 a Barrel After Saudi Arabia Attack\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Oil analysts expect prices to jump at least $5 to $10 a barrel Monday after a strike on a key facility cut Saudi Arabia\u2019s production by half, pulling some 5% of world supply off the market.\n\nSaudi Aramco lost about 5.7 million barrels per day of output after several unmanned aerial vehicles on Saturday struck the world\u2019s biggest crude-processing facility in Abqaiq and the kingdom\u2019s second-biggest oil field in Khurais. It could take weeks to restore normal production, according to people familiar with the matter. The Trump administration is ready to deploy the nation\u2019s emergency oil reserves and help stabilize markets if needed.\n\nOil sank 2.1% in London to $60.22 a barrel last week and 3% in New York to $54.85, amid concerns that slowing demand growth may augur another supply glut. Geopolitics wasn\u2019t much of a concern in traders\u2019 minds, but that\u2019s all changed now.\n\n\u201cThere is almost no geopolitical risk priced into oil markets that are focused solely on the macro and trade narratives,\u201c Joseph McMonigle, senior energy analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management LLC, said in a note.\n\nWhile analysts agree that prices will spike initially, the duration of the outage is key. Saudi Arabia has millions of barrels stored in locations around the world, which they can draw down to replace the lost production. A rally could also be tempered if the U.S. and other countries release oil from their strategic reserves to ease the shortfall.\n\n\u201cWe can expect prices to be $5/bbl higher when it opens,\u201d said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. \u201cThe events over the weekend show the vulnerability of oil facilities in the Mideast.\u201d\n\nClearView Energy Partners LLC sees potential for prices to rise $10 a barrel, assuming a three-week shutdown, according to a note to clients. If damage turns out to be extensive and the outage is extended, they expect a loosening of OPEC+ supplies and a coordinated release of strategic reserves from the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\n\u201c could go to $80 tomorrow, while WTI could go to $75,\u201d said Sandy Fielden, director of research for Morningstar Inc. \u201cBut that would depend on Aramco\u2019s 48-hour update. The supply problem won\u2019t be clear right away since the Saudis can still deliver from inventory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe initial move higher will depend on the strength of short-covering,\u201d Ole Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in Copenhagen, said by email. \u201cWe finished last week on a weak note after monthly oil market reports pointed to a prolonged supply glut.\u201d\n\nBrent may rise more than West Texas Intermediate, as the potential for release from theStrategic Petroleum Reserve and growing domestic production could restrain the U.S. benchmark. Bloomberg Intelligence sees Brent climbing back toward levels last seen in April.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\n\u201cBrent should regain much of the premium lost to West Texas Intermediate over the past few months. Rapidly increasing U.S. supply, the likelihood of releasing crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and potential for a ban on exports should provide a greater boost to the benchmark.\u201d\n\nMike McGlone, commodity strategist\n\nHeavy, high-sulfur crudes will also likely be in demand due to the type of oil that was taken off the market:", "description": "Oil May Jump as Much as $10 a Barrel After Saudi Arabia Attack", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPED4G0W4_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
