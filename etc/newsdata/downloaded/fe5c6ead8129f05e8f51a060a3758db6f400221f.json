Some of it's great, but a lot of it, well, isn't.\n\nTo figure out which current shows are worth watching or avoiding, we turned to the reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes to select the most critically acclaimed or loathed scripted show that each network and service is currently producing. We made some exceptions for shows that were canceled this year.\n\nWe excluded children's shows, talk shows, and docuseries, and we selected only from networks with multiple scripted shows that had enough reviews to receive a \"fresh\" or \"rotten\" designation. The critic score had to be designated \"fresh\" to be considered the best show and had to be below 75% to be the worst.\n\nHere are the best and worst current TV shows on 17 networks, according to critics:", "description": "We turned to Rotten Tomatoes to select the best and worst current TV show on all the major networks.
