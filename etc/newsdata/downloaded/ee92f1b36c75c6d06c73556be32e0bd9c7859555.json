She is believed to have been driving the car, and met Northamptonshire police afterwards but no investigation followed after the force was advised by the UK government that she had the protective status granted to foreign diplomats.\n\nDunn\u2019s parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, flew to the US on Sunday to \u201ccontinue our fight for justice\u201d. A family spokesman said on Monday that they would only meet Sacoolas if she agreed to return to the UK.\n\nCharles said before boarding her flight she had received a letter from Sacoolas expressing her \u201cdeepest sympathies and apologies\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo be perfectly honest, yes, it\u2019s the start of some closure for our family,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving said that, as it\u2019s nearly seven weeks now since we lost our boy, sorry just doesn\u2019t cut it.\u201d\n\nAfter six weeks of silence, Sacoolas issued a statement through her legal representative on Sunday to say she was \u201cdevastated by the tragic accident\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn\u2019s family,\u201d she said.\n\nHer lawyers said she had cooperated fully with the police. \u201cShe spoke with authorities at the scene of the accident and met with the Northampton police at her home the following day. She will continue to cooperate with the investigation,\u201d the statement continued.\n\n\u201cAnne would like to meet with Mr Dunn\u2019s parents so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident. We have been in contact with the family\u2019s attorneys and look forward to hearing from them.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Sky News on Monday, Radd Seiger, a spokesman for the parents, said Sacoolas needed to come back to the UK, present herself to Northamptonshire police and \u201clet the process go where it may\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very clear there\u2019s not much point in meeting and having pleasantries if that commitment isn\u2019t there,\u201d he said.\n\nLawyers advising Dunn\u2019s family have disputed whether or not Sacoolas ever had a right to diplomatic immunity. But the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, wrote to them on Saturday to say that Sacoolas\u2019s immunity was now irrelevant as she had returned home.\n\n\u201cWe have pressed strongly for a waiver of immunity, so that justice can be done \u2026 Whilst the US government has steadfastly declined to give that waiver, that is not the end of the matter,\u201d the letter read.\n\n\u201cWe have looked at this very carefully \u2026 the UK government\u2019s position is that immunity, and therefore any question of waiver, is no longer relevant in Mrs Sacoolas\u2019s case, because she has returned home. The US have now informed us that they too consider that immunity is no longer pertinent.\u201d\n\nDunn\u2019s parents are considering pursuing Sacoolas in the US courts for a civil claim. In a statement released before they travelled to the US, they said they \u201ccontinue to live in a nightmare\u201d and have so far been unable to grieve after his death.\n\n\u201cAs if losing Harry was not enough, they now find themselves having to expend enormous time and energy, which they can ill afford, generating sufficient publicity to garner public support to persuade the US government to help achieve closure and return the driver, Mrs Sacoolas, to England to face the consequences of her actions,\u201d it said.", "description": "Wife of US official apologises over fatal crash but mother says \u2018sorry just doesn\u2019t cut it\u2019", "authors": ["Frances Perraudin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d568ea4d9795dfdb855454cb5b482251f8aa85fc/855_478_2248_1349/master/2248.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=32c14734d51459762690c7343ca9efe2", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
