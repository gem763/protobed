The C5ISR Center and the system operators \"don't take any disposition on that but once we make that linkage we're able to have that person be nominated to watchlists and whatever action needs to be taken,\" Riser said.\n\nSince July 2018, CENTCOM, which operates in North Africa, the Middle East, and Central and South Asia, has been using the tech to wrangle the \"growing database\" of individuals in areas of operation using publicly available information. Some of that media comes from internet sources, such as publicly facing websites, and \"other forensic media that's been collected\" he said.\n\n\"I don't want to make this sound like we're going out there and scraping the internet because that's a huge problem in its own right. That's not really what we are. We're a face-matching system, providing the analyst a way to match faces against media that they have,\" Riser said. \"For the most part, it's something that they've had and want to be able to say 'who is this person' or they are out there in the field. You might not always be able to [collect] a fingerprint but this way we can check against the face.\"\n\nBut the rise of deep fakes does raise concerns for the Army. \"As we're collecting data, the potential for those images that we received to be a deep fake is becoming more and more of a possibility,\" Riser said. \"In some of our analysis, it's something that we've identified that we want to pursue more. Right now, when we have data against the watchlist we have pretty good confidence that it's not.\"\n\nIn the next two years or so, C5ISR wants to make VICE/VIBES a program of record. Decisions that determine whether that will happen will begin to take place in early 2020, Riser said.\n\nThe present focus, however, is on improving the Biometric Examination Services workflow that \"allows analysts to have a more accurate first pass on facial recognition,\" he said.\n\nRiser said he personally thinks the systems' \"capabilities will be able to persist and grow throughout the DOD and agency\" and wants to improve them, clean up data, and make it more shareable with other DOD systems.\n\nAbout the Author Lauren C.
