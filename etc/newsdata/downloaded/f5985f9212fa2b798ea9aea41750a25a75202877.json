The furry drivers were taught to navigate a custom-built rat car and the findings suggest rats may possess a greater ability to learn tasks than previously thought.\n\nThe experiment, first reported on by New Scientist, was the brainchild of the University of Richmond neuroscientist Kelly Lambert. Lambert and her colleagues created a tiny car out of an empty food container and retrofitted it with an aluminum bar and three copper bars for a steering wheel. The copper bar steering wheel and aluminum floor create an electrical current that can propel the car forward. The rats, when properly trained, could control the direction of the car by gripping the left, middle, or right copper bar with their tiny little paws.\n\nRat in a little car.

Eventually, the scientist went a step further and created a four square meter rectangular box for the rats to drive around in. The team gradually placed the Fruit Loops further and further away, encouraging the rats to fine-tune their driving.\n\n\"They learned to navigate the car in unique ways and engaged in steering patterns they had never used to eventually arrive at the reward,\" Lambert told New Scientist.\n\nNot all of the 11 male and six female rats in the experiment learned the same way. In an email sent to Insider, Lambert said the type of environment the rats were surrounded by affected the way they learned. The rats that lived in a complex, stimulating environment learned how to drive significantly faster than those living in dreary, boring laboratory settings.\n\n\"Those data suggest that we gain \"experiential capital\" if we have challenging, dynamic lifestyles that transfer to learning acquisition,\" Lambert said.\n\nDr. Kelly Lambert of the University of Richmond with one of her rat friends.

Like humans, Lambert said the rats seem to have received some satisfaction out of mastering a difficult task. But then again, unlike humans, the rats didn't have to deal with traffic.\n\nTwo rats outside of car. Kelly Lambert / University of Richmond\n\nWhile you won't find rats driving around on city streets anytime soon, Lambert and her fellow scientists said the experiment was significant because it suggests that rats' neuroplasticity \u2014the ability for their brain to adapt and learn new tasks \u2014 may be far greater than people once thought.\n\nThe driving test is just the start. Lambert told New Scientist she believes the tests could be made more complex and that the data gathered from observing the rats could potentially be used to help study the effects of Parkinson's disease and depression. Above all else, the findings were a win for team rat.\n\n\"I do believe that rats are smarter than most people perceive them to be and that most animals are smarter in unique ways than we think,\" Lambert said.\n\nYou can watch a video of the driving rodents here.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "If you think you can\u2019t get your driver\u2019s license, these rats did.", "authors": ["Mack Degeurin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5daf2683695b58558b054a38?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
