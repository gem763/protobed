There is a large Uighur refugee community in Turkey, and plenty of routes for desperate people to enter Europe from there. Beijing's embassy in London has yet to respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment.\n\nThe only reason why criminal gangs and people traffickers are making so much money out of all of this is that the refugee resettlement programme in the EU is absolutely destroyed Laurence Lee, Al Jazeera correspondent\n\n\"The National Crime Agency in this country is noting is that it is now a favoured option by these criminal gangs to put asylum seekers and refugeees inside these refrigerated lorries - it seems to me for the simple and horrific reason that it's much more difficult for the heat-seeking equipment used by border guards to work if they're in a fridge,\" said Al Jazeera's Laurence Lee, reporting from London.\n\n\"The main focus is that they're treating this as a criminal investigation - and all the politicians are saying 'oh, isn't it awful, these gangs exploiting people in this way' - which entirely diverts from the point that the only reason why criminal gangs and people traffickers are making so much money out of all of this is that the refugee resettlement programme in the EU is absolutely destroyed.\n\n\"There's this thing called the Dublin regulation under law, which insists a refugee or asylum seeker has to seek asylum in the first EU coiuntry they get into - and if you want to come to the UK, that automatically means you'll have to get yourself smuggled, otherwise everyone would have to apply for asylum in Greece or Bulgaria or one of these EU border countries.\n\n191023171201830\n\n\"And European countries repeatedly break the law by refusing these asylum claims. If that refugee policy under law was obeyed inside the EU, then these criminal gangs wouldn't make any of this money, and people wouldn't be dying in the way they are.\"\n\nMurder probe\n\nParamedics and police found the bodies early on Wednesday in a truck container on an industrial estate at Grays, about 20 miles (32 km) east of central London.\n\nBelgian prosecutors confirmed the container was shipped from the port of Zeebrugge on Tuesday.\n\nThe tragedy recalls the deaths of 58 migrants in 2000 in a truck in Dover, England, who had undertaken a perilous, months-long journey from China's southern Fujian province. They were discovered stowed away with a cargo of tomatoes after a ferry ride from Zeebrugge.\n\nEssex Police continue to question a 25-year-old man from Northern Ireland over the latest tragedy.\n\nHe was arrested on suspicion of murder, the police said, adding that raids had been carried out at three properties in Northern Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland police searched properties in the Northern Irish village of Laurelvale, County Armagh, where the driver and his family lived, late on Wednesday, reported the Belfast Telegraph.\n\n'Permeable borders'\n\nThe vehicle has been moved to a secure site at nearby Tilbury Docks where the bodies can be recovered and further forensic work undertaken to begin what police said would be the lengthy process of identifying the victims.\n\nThe National Crime Agency said it was assisting the investigation and working to \"urgently identify and take action against any organised crime groups who have played a role in causing these deaths\".\n\nShaun Sawyer, the national spokesman for British police on human trafficking, said many thousands of people were seeking to come to the United Kingdom. While they were able to rescue many of those smuggled into the country, Britain was perceived by organised crime as a potentially easy target for traffickers.\n\n\"You can't turn the United Kingdom into a fortress. We have to accept that we have permeable borders,\" he told BBC radio.", "description": "Essex Police are still questioning a 25-year-old man from Northern Ireland who was arrested on suspicion of murder.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/23/f3d39f6a7141425ca2726759af31db31_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
