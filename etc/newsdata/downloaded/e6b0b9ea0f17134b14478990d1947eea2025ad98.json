I get that flying around inside the eye is calm and serene but how did you get in there? How do you plan on getting out?\n\n\n\nAre you insane? \u2014 Travis Cummings (@Darth_CreecH) September 1, 2019\n\nAmazing and breathtaking and omnious and terrifying at the same time. \u2014 Lisa (@615_Goddess) September 1, 2019\n\nWow. People who fly into these things are incredible. \u2014 Dave Perrino (@DavePerrino) September 1, 2019\n\nI knew I had seen this before...#DayAfterTomorrow pic.twitter.com/QjZPvgKdXO \u2014 Scott From Scotland (@ScottDuncanWX) September 1, 2019\n\nNature is beautiful. Nature is terrifying \u2014 Aaron Faubel (@thegodfaubel) September 1, 2019\n\nAnd what\u2019s more mind boggling, a plane flying in it. \u2014 Dwayne Ramirez Etura Sa \ud83e\uddd4\ud83c\udffd (@hormigaatomika2) September 2, 2019\n\nBalls of steel. I salute you ! \u2014 Project Ace (@Mr_Kev_G) September 1, 2019\n\nThat is a badass photo shot. I have so much respect for the Air Force pilots, who risk their lives to keep us all safe. Thank you for your service. \u2014 Kikiki (@tiakiki246) September 1, 2019\n\nBoth terrifying and beautiful! This storm is nothing short of perfection. #Dorian \u2014 meh\u2022liss\u2022ah (@themelosophy) September 1, 2019\n\nIts structural perfection is matched only by its hostility. \u2014 SaltyDog (@thesaltydog42) September 1, 2019\n\nLove HuffPost?
