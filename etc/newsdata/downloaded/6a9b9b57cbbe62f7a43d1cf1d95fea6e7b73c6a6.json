Here\u2019s where else gay rights are a battleground in the world.", "language": "en", "text": "They are not alone.\n\nAt least 68 countries \u2014 including Iran, Saudi Arabia and Singapore \u2014 have laws on the books criminalizing same-sex relations involving consenting adults, according to New York-based Human Rights Watch. At least nine others have criminal laws that target transgender and gender-nonconforming people.\n\nAD\n\nEven in some countries with no criminal laws against same-sex relationships \u2014 such as Russia and Hungary \u2014 there\u2019s a \u201creal hostility based on a fear that an increase in gender equality writ large will destabilize the patriarchy,\u201d said Neela Ghoshal, senior researcher for LGBT Rights at New York-based Human Rights Watch.\n\nAD\n\nHere\u2019s a look at five countries engaged in high-profile battles over LGBTQ rights.\n\nUganda\n\nThe east African country of Uganda has one of the world\u2019s harshest laws for gay sex (life imprisonment). That\u2019s even after the government in 2014, responding to international pressure, nullified a bill known in Uganda as \u201cKill the Gays,\u201d making homosexuality a capital offense.\n\nAD\n\nThe law in Uganda \u2014 which bans \u201ccarnal intercourse against the order of nature\u201d \u2014 is a holdover from British colonial rule.\n\nAsia Russell, the Uganda-based executive director of Health GAP, an organization that campaigns for access to HIV-medications, noted that there\u2019s been \u201cimportant progress\u201d in neighboring countries and other former British commonwealths in repealing similar British colonial laws, citing Botswana, Angola, Mozambique and India.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cUganda is resisting doing that, despite the fact that its exploring penal code reform in other areas and that the criminalization of homosexuality is not a priority for ordinary Ugandans,\u201d she said.\n\nRussell also connected the recent arrests with an \u201cuptake in civic unrest\u201d happening in Uganda. \u201cCivic space is shrinking,\u201d she said. \u201cPolice and the military are cracking down harder and harder on dissent. And at the same time, they are deploying a playbook of trying to scapegoat minority communities,\u201d LGBTQ people included.\n\nAD\n\nShe compared the situation to Egypt, where LGBTQ people, long stigmatized, have become a particular scapegoat and target of state violence amid an ongoing crackdown.\n\nPoland\n\nPoland\u2019s constitution explicitly prohibits marriage not between a man a woman, which is legal in the rest of the European Union. (There\u2019s no law criminalizing same-sex relations.)\n\nAD\n\nPoland\u2019s far-right Law and Justice party won a majority in the 2015 election on an anti-immigrant agenda. In campaigning this October, the party emphasized another agenda: homophobia. They prevailed again.\n\nThe party leader, 70-year-old Jaroslaw Kaczynski, has called \u201cLGBT ideology\u201d an imported \u201cthreat to Polish identity, to our nation, to its existence and thus to the Polish state,\u201d The Post reported in July.\n\nAD\n\nKenya\n\nIn much of Africa, homosexuality remains a major taboo. In May, Kenya almost became one of a handful of countries on the continent to legalize homosexual relations. Instead, the Supreme Court ruled to keep the colonial-era law, which includes jail terms of five to 14 years. The judges said they \u201cwere not persuaded by the petitioners that the offenses against them are overboard.\u201d\n\nNPR reported at the time, \u201cThe measures have not been widely enforced \u2014 Human Rights Watch said it was aware of just two prosecutions against four people in the last decade. Instead, the organization says, the laws have served as a pretense to mistreat LGBTQ people, who report harrowing accounts of being forced into sex, discriminated against at work, suspended from schools, pressured into paying off authorities and other abuses.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLebanon\n\nLebanon has the reputation as the gay (and party) capital of the Middle East \u2014 but it\u2019s complicated. The country has laws on the books that criminalize homosexual relations, though several lower courts in recent years have sided with gay individuals who\u2019ve challenged these laws.\n\nLebanon held the Middle East\u2019s first Gay Pride Parade in 2017. The next year, however, the main organizer was arrested and the event was curtailed. Last year, organizers had to cancel the opening event after police said they couldn\u2019t protect participants from threats from religious leaders.\n\n\u201cThe cancellation comes after death threats prompted a Lebanese festival in July to pull an appearance by one of the Middle East\u2019s most popular bands, Mashrou\u2019 Leila, which has a gay frontman, leading to fears of a crackdown on LGBT+ rights,\u201d Reuters reported at the time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBrunei\n\nIn May, the Sultan of the small Southeast Asia island-nation of Brunei rescinded legislation that included death by stoning for those caught engaging in gay sex and adultery. People can still face 10 years in jail for same-sex relations.\n\n\u201cThe United Nations called the laws draconian, and the move prompted calls for a boycott of Brunei-controlled hotels from Hollywood celebrities including George Clooney and Ellen DeGeneres,\u201d The Washington Post reported. \u201cWestern governments had been quietly lobbying Brunei to refrain from implementing the laws, which they said would complicate trade deals with the oil-rich sultanate.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "", "authors": ["Miriam Berger", "Reporter Covering Middle East", "Foreign Affairs"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dW3JCvk8vyd7u3pXOcOCK6TrEiI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KPBNMYXXKUI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
