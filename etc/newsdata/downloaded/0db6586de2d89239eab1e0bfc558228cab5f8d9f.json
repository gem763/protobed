But behind the veneer of the carefully constructed image of these K-pop band sensations is a culture of extreme pressure, hyper-scrutiny, and unaddressed mental health problems.\n\nThe recent death of 25-year-old Korean pop star Sulli has once again raised concerns about the unbearably high pressures of K-pop fame. The former member of the Korean girl group f(x) was found dead in her Seongnam, South Korea, home on Monday in what police say appears to be suicide. Sulli openly discussed the cyberbullying she faced for being outspoken about social issues in conservative South Korea and revealed her struggles with mental health in a recent interview, saying that she had been \"lying to everyone by pretending to be happy.\"\n\nHowever, Sulli is not the only Korean idol battling mental health issues \u2014 reports have cited a growing crisis in the K-pop industry. In 2017, Kim Jong-hyun, a former member of popular boy band SHINee, took his own life and left a note behind describing his crippling depression, writing that \"the life of fame was not for me.\u201d\n\nHowever, the culture of silence around mental health extends to South Korean society at large. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, South Korea has consistently had one of the highest suicide rates among developed countries, prompting its government to take steps to tackle the issue.\n\nEuny Hong, the Korean-American author of The Birth of Korean Cool: How One Nation is Conquering the World with Pop Culture, tells Yahoo Lifestyle that the increasing pressures of being a K-pop star from their record labels and the public, combined with the stigmas around mental illness in South Korea, will continue to drive its idols over the edge.\n\n\u201cKoreans have only had internationally known stars for a few decades, so they are even less equipped to deal with this kind of thing,\u201d Hong tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThat, and the taboo against seeking psychiatric care, all but guarantees that these kinds of tragedies will keep happening unless there is a fundamental societal change.\u201d\n\nTraining a Korean pop \u201cidol\u201d\n\nAs K-pop expert and music journalist Jeff Benjamin put it, \u201cNo one just shows up to the K-pop scene.\u201d The synchronized choreography and perfect harmony fans see on stage from their favorite Korean pop stars is the product of years of grueling training.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re called K-pop idol and that\u2019s an important word when thinking about this industry,\u201d Benjamin tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThis idea that they\u2019re supposed to be ideal and perfect \u2014 that\u2019s the reason they train so rigorously and intensely before they debut.\u201d\n\nKorean performers are discovered through massive global auditions, similar to that of \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d or are recruited on the street for their looks alone. After signing a contract with entertainment companies like SM Entertainment (Sulli\u2019s talent agency), then they undergo a notoriously brutal training that professor Lee Dong-yeon, who teaches cultural theory at the Korean National University, told South China Morning Post is known as the \u201cidol farm system.\u201d\n\n\u201cPop idol trainees often follow an arduous daily schedule that includes two hours of exercise, four hours of dance and choreography classes, two hours of vocal training, followed by three hours of language studies,\u201d South China Morning Post reported.\n\nStella Kim, a trainee who was on track join South Korean girl group Girls Generation, recalled being forced to go on a scale in front of other trainees and developing an eating disorder as a result. \u201cThey would make us stand in line and go on the scale,\u201d Kim shared with the Asian-American publication, NextShark. \u201cThey would call out what your weight is in front of everyone. If your weight had not gone down from the week prior, you would get bashed on.\u201d At one point, the 5-foot-7 former aspiring K-pop star weighed only 90 pounds.\n\n\u201cIn the Korean entertainment industry, beauty is often associated with physical appearance,\u201d Kim added. \u201cBeauty is often an exaggeration of femininity or masculinity\u2026 All extremely distorted views that are unfortunately set by socio-cultural standards in a high-pressure, fast-paced society.\u201d", "description": "The recent death of 25-year-old Korean pop star Sulli has once again raised concerns about the unbearably high pressures of K-pop fame.", "authors": ["Paulina Cachero"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kbrBVkED8idqUDhlhHPGKw--~B/aD01MjM5O3c9MzQ5MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/0be76250-eeb7-11e9-beb7-219e414446af", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
