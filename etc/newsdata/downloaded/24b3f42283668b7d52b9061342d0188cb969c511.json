The company is now under administration.\n\nPort Access\n\nIts assets include the Optimum coal mine, the Koornfontein colliery and a share in Richards Bay Coal Terminal, which allows it to export the fuel. Port access for coal producers in South Africa is a prized asset and Richards Bay is the biggest coal export port on the continent.\n\nThe venture will bid for all the assets, said Adams, adding that Smada derives its name by spelling his surname backward. By being 51% owned by black South African companies it complies with Eskom\u2019s procurement guidelines as it tries to boost black participation in the economy a quarter of a century after the end of apartheid. Initially the venture hadn\u2019t included Smada.\n\nAdams said he was introduced to DSA by the Qatar Investment Authority, with which he has \u201ca relationship.\u201d\n\nLouis Klopper, one of the business rescue administrators running the sales process, confirmed the bid from DSA and Smada. The deadline for bidders submitting their information is Tuesday evening South African time and they are targeting a final decision on the winning bidder in about a month.\n\nDisrepair\n\nA sale could end the controversy around the mines that have sunk into disrepair.\n\nIn 2015, the then-mining minister, Mosebenzi Zwane, flew to Switzerland to meet with Glencore\u2019s chief executive officer, Ivan Glasenberg, to convince him to sell the assets to the Guptas. Eskom loaned them part of the money to buy the company, and gave them supply contracts on favorable terms. The transaction is being investigated by a state-appointed commission of inquiry into allegations of corruption.\n\nDSA says it manages assets worth more than $10 billion. Nehawu Investment has assets worth more than 3 billion rand, according to its website.\n\n(Adds detail on Richards Bay in the fifth paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Antony Sguazzin in Johannesburg at asguazzin@bloomberg.net;Archana Narayanan in Dubai at anarayanan16@bloomberg.net;Paul Burkhardt in Johannesburg at pburkhardt@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: John McCorry at jmccorry@bloomberg.net, Robert Brand, Hilton Shone\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Dubai\u2019s DSA Investments has teamed up with two South African companies to bid for coal assets that Glencore Plc was pressured into selling to a company controlled by the politically connected Gupta family in 2015.Orchid Mining, a unit of DSA, owns 49% of the venture making the bid and", "authors": ["Antony Sguazzin", "Archana Narayanan", "Paul Burkhardt"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rNgNRyNWuxaZTAvkLzyldw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MTk5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/46fe01b55ded767c9dde2763d610de73", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
