They have their own calls and their own spirit as the bomb squad.\n\n\u2018Basically what happens after each game is that we shake hands with the opposition. As we were completing the handshakes, the bomb squad was coming together to do their call or chant.\n\n\u2018As I was walking towards them I realised that they were about to do their call, and that I wasn\u2019t part of it, so I decided that I needed to move away.\n\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t part of it, but there was nothing wrong there with what they were doing - we are united as a team.\u2019\n\nThe six players in the huddle were indeed all substitutes in the Test: Steven Kitshoff, Vincent Koch, RG Snyman, Franco Mostert, Francois Louw and Steyn.\n\nMapimpi scored his 11th try in as many Tests for the Springboks in the match as he looks to cement his spot in the left-wing jersey.\n\nTeams:", "description": "Springbok wing Makazole Mapimpi has explained why he wasn't part of a post-Test celebration huddle after the team's thrashing of Italy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7885/90a3bdbea2004f049cf9312c0e73d68b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
