REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\nLOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - \u201cHustlers\u201d rolled in the Benjamins this weekend, collecting $33.2 million when it debuted in 3,250 North American theaters.\n\nBoosted by rave reviews and stellar word of mouth, \u201cHustlers\u201d beat expectations and now ranks as the best start for an STX film, along with the biggest live-action opening weekend for stars Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu. Directed by Lorene Scafaria, \u201cHustlers\u201d is based on Jessica Pressler\u2019s 2015 New York magazine article about a group of strippers who turn the tables on their wealthy Wall Street clientele after the 2008 recession hits.\n\nNot all newcomers were as fortunate. Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cThe Goldfinch,\u201d adapted from Donna Tartt\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, misfired with a disastrous $2.6 million from 2,542 locations. Those ticket sales are well behind projections that estimated an opening weekend near $12 million. The mystery drama, which cost $40 million to produce, stars Ansel Elgort stars as Theo, a young man who turns to art forgery after losing his mother in a freak tragedy. \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d was skewered by critics after it premiered at the Toronto Film Festival.\n\nDespite a sour start for \u201cThe Goldfinch,\u201d Warner Bros. still dominated box office charts. For the second weekend in a row, \u201cIt: Chapter Two\u201d was the No. 1 movie in North America. The scary sequel pocketed another $40 million this weekend, boosting its domestic tally to $153 million. Between \u201cIt: Chapter Two\u201d and its predecessor, the franchised based on Stephen King\u2019s horror novel has generated over $1 billion worldwide.\n\nLionsgate\u2019s \u201cAngel Has Fallen\u201d slid to third place, adding $4.4 million in its fourth weekend of release. At No. 4, Universal\u2019s comedy \u201cGood Boys\u201d picked up $4.2 million, taking its bounty to a solid $73 million in North America. Rounding out the top five is Disney\u2019s \u201cThe Lion King\u201d with $3.5 million. After nine weeks in theaters, the remake has amassed a mighty $534 million at the domestic box office.", "description": "LOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - \"Hustlers\" rolled in the Benjamins this weekend, collecting $33.2 million when it debuted in 3,250 North American theaters.", "authors": ["Rebecca Rubin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430146588&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0KH-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
