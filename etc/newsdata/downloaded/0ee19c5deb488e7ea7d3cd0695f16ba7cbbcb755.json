The full tweet read as follows:\n\n\"The Bahamas, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas...may all be in our prayers now. Millions of us seeing Dorian turn away from land is not a wacky idea; it is creative use of the power of the mind. Two minutes of prayer, visualization, meditation for those in the way of the storm.\"\n\nAfter Williams deleted the tweet, several people called her out for a nonsensical suggestion that \"mind power\" could somehow affect the path of the hurricane, which is slowly making its way up the East Coast after devastating the islands of the Bahamas.\n\n\"Marianne Williamson's tweet claiming we can turn Hurricane Dorian away with our collective minds is just as crazy as claiming we can solve gun violence with thoughts and prayers,\" journalist Ahmed Baba wrote.\n\n\"This deleted tweet by @marwilliamson needs to be spread far and wide,\" writer and podcast host Chrissy Stroop wrote. \"No one who thinks that 'power of the mind' kept a hurricane away from Florida is fit to be president. And it seems she thinks Bahamians didn't pray enough? Racist much?\"\n\nWhen journalist Yashar Ali pointed out that Williamson had deleted the tweet, she fired back.\n\n\"Since you obviously want to debunk, counter or mischaracterize anything I do, would you like to have an honest and fair public dialogue?\" Williamson tweeted back to Ali. \"Since I'm neither crazy, irresponsible nor dangerous, I would appreciate the opportunity to counter the caricature.\"\n\nSince you obviously want to debunk, counter or mischaracterize anything I do, would you like to have an honest and fair public dialogue? Since I\u2019m neither crazy, irresponsible nor dangerous, I would appreciate the opportunity to counter the caricature. \u2014 Marianne Williamson (@marwilliamson) September 4, 2019\n\nAli responded: \"Not sure why this tweet provoked your frustration @marwilliamson. I simply noted that you deleted a tweet. I did not editorialize,\" he wrote. He then rejected her offer for a \"public dialogue,\" saying he is reserving his time \"to speak with candidates who qualified for the debate.\"\n\nWilliamson, who did not meet the criteria to participate in September's Democratic presidential debate, seemed to double down on the now-deleted tweet.\n\n\"Prayer is a power of the mind, and it is neither bizarre nor unintelligent. People of faith belong in the Democratic Party, and will be necessary to the effort if we're to win in 2020.\"\n\n\"I was born and raised in Texas so I've seen it,\" she wrote in another tweet. \"Millions of people today are praying that Dorian turn away from land, and treating those people with mockery or condescension because they believe it could help is part of how the overly secularized Left has lost lots of voters.\"\n\nPrayer is a power of the mind, and it is neither bizarre nor unintelligent.

Its purpose is to create a new political possibility in America \u2014 where citizens awaken, our hearts and minds are uplifted, and our democracy once more becomes a thing about which we can all feel proud.\"", "description": "\"I was born and raised in Texas so I've seen it,\" she wrote in another tweet about the power of prayer", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/04/1a3cfb75-19c7-4b3f-abbf-7d5fa6860d08/thumbnail/1200x630g2/7b4e99df60dc87dd5948eb13e62123f5/gettyimages-1165415237.jpg"}
