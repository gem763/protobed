What did happen? I think like the rest of the country right now I'm in massive shock. Absolutely gutted for Dev and Dianne.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nPresenter Lorraine Kelly then asked Joe is his girlfriend Dianne was OK.\n\nShaking his head, he said: \"No, not really. I really don't think it should have been them to go.\n\n\"I think they had so much potential. He was an amazing student. It doesn't seem...\"\n\nSeemingly holding back and unable to finish his thought, Joe added: \"Weird.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nJoe had been desperately trying to make sure Dev and Dianne got through - but it was in vain.\n\nIt appeared he had been repeatedly calling the show's voting phone lines to vote for the pair over and over.\n\nOn his Instagram story, he wrote: \"Spending the interval calling the same robot lady over and over,\" as he joked: \"She's really polite\".\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nJoe also reacted to the couple's shock departure on Instagram, posting a picture of the duo in action with the caption: \"So gutted for these two. They were incredible - honestly so shocked.\"\n\nHe added: \"Tell me how that hip is not a 10?\"\n\nThere was a startled atmosphere in the Strictly studio when the judges sent home Dev and Dianne.\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nThey all voted to save dance-off rivals Viscountess Emma Weymouth and her partner Alja\u017e \u0160korjanec.\n\nDespite not receiving the lowest scores last night, the two couples found themselves having to perform their routines again after the combined public vote and judges\u2019 scores from last night left them in the vulnerable position.\n\nWhen asked by Tess Daly about his time on the show, Dev said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie I am absolutely gutted, but learning how to dance, hanging out with Dianne and the other pros and celebs\u2026 I\u2019ve absolutely loved it.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nSobbing Dianne was asked if she had any words for Dev after discovering they had been given the boot.\n\nShe said: \"Dev has been absolutely amazing. His work ethic is insane. I see him everywhere practising and I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better partner.\n\n\"Thank you so much for all your time and your effort. This boy has so much talent, I\u2019m really sad he won\u2019t be able to show you guys any more of it.\"\n\n*Lorraine airs weekdays on ITV at 8.30am", "description": "The YouTube star admitted he was 'gutted' for Dianne and celeb partner Dev Griffin after their controversial departure", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv", "Bbc Guy Levy"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20575324.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Joe-Sugg-gives-worrying-update-on-girlfriend-Dianne-Buswell-after-Strictly-exit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
