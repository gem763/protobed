It's about creative writing student Samantha Heather Mackey, a woman who has an otherworldly encounter with a group of tight-knit rich girls from her MFA program.\n\nBunny is being adapted for television by AMC. Awad's previous book, 13 Ways of Looking at a Fat Girl, was shortlisted for the 2016 Scotiabank Giller Prize and won the Amazon Canada First Novel Award.\n\nShe spoke with Shelagh Rogers about writing Bunny.\n\nBunnies\n\n\"There is such an overt, almost aggressive sweetness to the iconography around bunnies. The bunny always had different kinds of feelings associated with it that are in conflict. It's this sense of sweetness and the adorable \u2014 and this sense of the more sinister and the mysterious and the unexplained.\"\n\nFairy tale influences\n\n\"The book draws a lot from fairy tales. There is actually a fairy tale that features a rabbit as an animal bridegroom. It's a Beauty and the Beast-like story called The Hare's Bride. That story, even though it has a sweetness to it, has a sinister, mysterious and lonely quality to it as well.\n\n\"Alice in Wonderland was also a huge influence for this book. I loved fairy tales as a child. They were the stories that I was interested in reading again and again. They cast such a spell. I didn't quite understand fairy tales on a logical plane, but I understood emotionally what was going on in the story.\n\nThere is such an overt, almost aggressive sweetness to the iconography around bunnies. - Mona Awad\n\n\"I studied them more deeply in graduate school. This was before I did an MFA at Brown. I did an MA in English literature at the University of Edinburgh, where I studied the role of fear in the fairy tale. That was a huge influence on my wanting to write this book.\"\n\nThe horror element\n\n\"Samantha is not a unreliable narrator. The outsiderness she experiences being in this world \u2014 that sense of pain, embarrassment and not fitting in \u2014 is colouring the way she sees the Bunnies, the campus and her professors. This feeling is generating a lot of the horror.\n\n\"Part of the reason why I pushed myself into the terrain of horror \u2014 there is a bit of violence in the book \u2014 is because it's present in fairy tales. As wondrous as they are, and as much as they are stories that explore wish fulfilment and your wildest dreams coming true, they also explore encountering your worst fear, your absolute nightmare. And they explore it in a very visceral way.\"\n\nHigh school confidential\n\n\"There was an intentional infantilization that I was interested in exploring with Bunny. It was amazing to me \u2014 as I was going into graduate school and moving through academics \u2014 how even though we're all adults, there's still something fundamentally 'high school-ish' about the academic atmosphere. It's so insular. If you go to a program that's funded, your essential needs are taken care of.\n\nThere was an intentional infantilization that I was interested in exploring with Bunny. - Mona Awad\n\n\"You can leave the world behind when you're in the bubble of this community. In that community, there are cliques and there are people who don't fit in as easily. There are disparities in class and social status. There is a high school quality to this world that I wanted to draw out.\"\n\nMona Awad's comments have been edited for length and clarity.", "description": "The Montreal-born author speaks with Shelagh Rogers about creating a surreal and modern fairy tale set on a college campus.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4988303.1564496767!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bunny-by-mona-awad.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
