Sign up here.\n\nPlanning to shut off power to millions of people in California didn't stop a utility company's top brass from enjoying a few glasses of wine with some of their biggest clients.\n\nFaulty equipment from California's largest utility company, PG&E, has sparked wildfires in the state over the last several years. To prevent another one, the company cut off power to more than 2 million people, starting Wednesday. But as hundreds of thousands of people in Northern California prepared for blackouts, PG&E\u2019s execs were wining and dining their top natural gas customers at a lavish retreat in wine country earlier in the week, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nJust two years ago, the company\u2019s electrical poles ignited a series of fires in Sonoma County, where the retreat was.\n\nThe company\u2019s CEO apparently only heard about the confab on Monday and Tuesday from reporters, and he wasn\u2019t pleased about it. \u201cI want to apologize to every one of our customers,\u201d Bill Johnson told the Chronicle. \u201cInsensitive, inappropriate, tone-deaf are the terms I would use to describe this.\u201d He said he would\u2019ve stopped the get-together from happening if he'd known about it.\n\nBy Friday, more than 300,000 households and businesses still didn\u2019t have power. California\u2019s economy stands to lose an estimated $2.5 billion because of the blackouts. For the elderly and disabled who may need power to run their medical devices, the outages are far more than just an inconvenience \u2014 they can be deadly.\n\nDespite the effort at fire prevention, blazes ignited in California this week. An 11-acre wildfire \u2014 under power transmission towers south of San Francisco that PG&E had not shut down \u2014 prompted firefighters to go door-to-door to inform residents of a voluntary evacuation order, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe company declared bankruptcy in January after a series of lawsuits related to their role in sparking fires in 2017 and 2018. For example, the electrical tower responsible for last year\u2019s Camp Fire should have been replaced 25 years earlier, according to the New York Times. The fire killed 85 people, making it the deadliest wildfire in California\u2019s history. The state of California allowed the company to charge its customers more so it could upgrade its grid, but it hasn\u2019t fully done that yet.\n\nThe company\u2019s natural gas operation was responsible for a fire too: In 2010, a gas line in San Bruno exploded and sparked a blaze that killed eight people and destroyed 38 homes.\n\nCover image: Gas customers fill up their extra gas cans at the Robinson Gas Station, Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2019 in Nevada City, Calif. Millions of people were poised to lose electricity throughout northern and central California after Pacific Gas & Electric Co. announced Tuesday it would shut off power in the largest preventive outage in state history to try to avert wildfires caused by faulty lines.
