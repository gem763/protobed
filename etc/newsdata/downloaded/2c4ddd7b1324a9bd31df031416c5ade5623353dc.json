This silver sphere of leaves shaped like swords (aptly named silversword) has waited nearly a century for this one epic moment\u2014sending up a nearly six foot, bright green stalk covered in 600 purple flowers.\n\nWith this splendid crown resting on its aging head and its seeds scattered to the wind, it dies.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Beast Travel Digest Get the entire world in your inbox.

With climate change now a global emergency, the national parks we love\u2014along with their defining colors, animal life, and landscapes\u2014are facing an irrevocable loss, becoming unintentional pentimentos bearing the evidence of our poor foresight and apathy.\n\nHawaii, for example, is home to 1,400 species, approximately 90 percent of them endemic to the region, according to the Division of Forestry and Wildlife. As small as the state is, it is home to 44 percent of the country\u2019s \u201cendangered and threatened plant species.\u201d National parks like Haleakala are there to help protect many of these species.\n\nEarly in the last century, climbers would scale Haleakala and rip the giant flower off the silversword to take it home and prove they made it to the top. While that type of direct vandalism is no longer permitted, other threats are proving less manageable. The plant\u2019s future at Hawaii\u2019s Haleakala National Park\u2014like thousands of plants and animals in all national parks\u2014depends largely on controlling climate change.\n\nIn many cases, the very features after which parks are named are vanishing as a result of climate change.\n\nGlacier National Park is the namesake of the glaciers that are rapidly disappearing. Just a century ago, there were 150 glaciers in the park; today there are 25; and by 2030 the park could be free of active glaciers.\n\nGlacial melt is an annual, irreplaceable water source for life at Glacier, whose benefits trickle down to the park, allowing insects to thrive and a productive huckleberry crop that feeds the threatened population of grizzlies. Drier climates not only lead to glacial drought, it also leads to higher temperatures and more wildfires, like those that plagued the park last year.\n\nSimilarly, Joshua trees at Joshua Tree National Park are facing their own uncertain future. As a species, Joshua trees have been around from the Pleistocene upwards of 2.5 million years ago, and are strong survivors. Joshua trees live an average of 150 years, though one in California is believed to be close to 1,000 years old.\n\nThey are, however, no match for prolonged human activity.\n\nA study published in June from UC Riverside Center for Conservation Biology of Joshua trees at the park, concludes that if climate change continues as it is, the famous tree faces \u201can almost complete elimination of the species from the park by the end-of-century.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the year during the government shutdown, the park made the news as vandals took advantage of it being unguarded and chopped several trees down. But even without direct threats like that happening every day, warmer weather and its subsequent drier soil leads to fewer seeds from the tree germinating.\n\nThere are few places not affected strongly by warming temperatures.\n\nYellowstone National Park and the Great Yellowstone area, for example, are increasingly experiencing warmer winters. The warmer temps not only lead to drier summers and more wildfires, they enable the mountain pine beetle to attack a recognizable feature of the park, the whitebark pine trees, leaving less of their nuts for the wildlife sustained by them.\n\nIn Florida, Everglades National Park is the \u201clargest subtropical wilderness in the United States,\u201d protector of the mangroves, home to threatened species, and an important barrier against hurricanes. It too is seeing unprecedented change driven by human activity. (Building projects have meant the draining of its waters and altering the system that keeps the Everglades functioning.)\n\nOn a larger scale, as the planet warms sea levels have risen and have increasingly pushed the freshwater-saltwater barrier inland in the Everglades, destroying marshes and causing mangroves to decline and retreat.\n\nOther parks are not only affected by warming weather, but also by a build-up of air pollution.\n\nThe Great Smoky Mountains National Park, for example, is one of the nearly 90 percent of national parks facing problems due to air pollution from the burning of coal in the region. Much of the blue haze in the mountains comes from natural sources, but air pollution has generated it\u2019s own haze, increasing health risks and reducing visibility\u2014with visibility, of course, being one of the leading reasons people visit the park.\n\nOver several decades, the Clean Air Act has helped to improve air quality and significantly reduce pollution there, but the Trump administration has taken aim at its regulations to weaken them, arguing that they hurt businesses.\n\nThe window for shifting these changes in the planet\u2019s climate is either closed or closing\u2014depending on the disaster scenario of the future that turns out to be most accurate. Scientific predictions of the future are not heart-warming.\n\nA study from last year, for example, shows that sea level rise and storm surges are threatening national parks as \u201capproximately one-fourth of all National Park Service sites are situated on or near the coast.\u201d Another report from the U.N. in May shows that 1 million species are threatened with extinction\u2014with a large portion only just decades away.\n\nStudies like these have pushed many countries to feel a sense of urgency in handling climate change. On Sept. 23, for example, the U.N. convenes its Climate Action Summit in New York.\n\nWe are, it seems, reaching a type of inflection point, where the ease with which hurricanes can rise to a Category 5 and leave islands in complete devastation is hard to ignore and where a younger generation of leaders, like 16-year old Greta Thunberg, are calling everyone, including adults, to step up. (Having sailed on an emissions-free yacht across the Atlantic Ocean to speak at the Action Summit, Thunberg is herself a force of nature.)\n\nWhile many nations have set out to keep the ball rolling on fighting climate change, the U.S. continues its trek backward to the outmoded thinking that helped create this mess, favoring industry profits now over long-term thinking.\n\nAmerica is a wealthy country, as President Trump recently noted, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not going to lose that wealth, I\u2019m not going to lose it on dreams, on windmills, which frankly aren\u2019t working too well.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a conviction he\u2019s backed by abandoning the Paris Agreement, weakening the Endangered Species Act and regulations on methane gas last month, and reducing the power of the Clean Air Act. A recent analysis from the New York Times of the administration shows over 80 environmental rules being rolled back.\n\nAnd the president is partially correct.\n\nAmerica\u2019s not going to lose that wealth on windmills, rather it will lose it on short-sighted and greedy decisions by its leadership. That will tear apart the very land we claim to cherish and one of our best assets.\n\nAs historian Walter Stegner once said, the national parks are America\u2019s \u201cbest idea,\u201d but as it stands now, we may one day be grieving them as America\u2019s greatest loss.", "description": "If there is continued inaction on climate change, many of the country\u2019s most iconic natural destinations will be indelibly changed.", "authors": ["Brandon Withrow"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568957542/190911-oconnor-climate-disappearing-tease2_bt5bzz", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
