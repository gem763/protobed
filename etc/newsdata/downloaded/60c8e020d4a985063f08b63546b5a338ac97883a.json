At altitude, planes do not use headlights in the traditional sense.\n\n\u201cMany times when I am making oceanic crossings at night, there is nothing outside the windshield but blackness for hours on end,\u201d says pilot and flying instructor Tim Sanders.\n\n\u201cAs pilots learn the art of science and flight, we have to make a transition to using our flight instruments, navigation sensors and weather sensors (primarily radar) to substitute for normal vision during night or other times when in cloud.\u201d\n\nDo planes have headlights?\n\nThough aircraft do not have headlights in the traditional sense, they do have a plethora of illuminations, each performing a different function.\n\nThe lights closest to those we might have on our cars or motorbikes are the landing lights employed by the flight deck on approach to an airport. They are positioned in different places on different aircraft, from the wing to the fuselage.\n\nPlanes line up on the approach to Heathrow Credit: istock More\n\nThese not only help the pilot land at night but also make the aircraft more noticeable to anyone in the vicinity. To become yet more conspicuous some pilots will flash their landing lights on final approach or when they have deployed their landing gear to let the air traffic control tower know.\n\nOther lights on an aircraft include red and green LEDs on each wing to indicate to other aircraft at night which direction the plane is facing - green right, red left. There are also anti-collision beacon lights on the top and bottom of the fuselage that rotate reddish orange to produce a flashing effect. These are turned on as long as the plane\u2019s engines are running.\n\nHow powerful are plane lights?\n\nLighting experts Oxley, a company which began life producing capacitors for the military in the Second World War, today serves all sorts of aviation clients with the lights needed for a modern aircraft.\n\nAmong them are landing lights able to operate in temperatures from -54C to 71C. Their peak intensity is 600,000cd - that\u2019s 600,000 candela, offering about 600,000 the luminous intensity of a single candle.\n\nHefty wing lights Credit: istock More\n\nStory continues", "description": "Anyone who has ever star-gazed will know that aircraft use lights when flying, pesky planes masquerading as shooting stars throughout the hours of darkness.", "authors": ["Hugh Morris"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1mc4zEGZdhFxZjiBTRoQag--~B/aD0xMzI2O3c9MjEyMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/ef94ecb070da5642a132ccf755a32228", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
