But his goal of swift withdrawals in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan have been stymied by concerns from US officials and American allies about the dangerous voids that would remain.\n\nAs he faces an impeachment inquiry at home, Trump has grown more mindful about making good on his political pledges, even at the risk of sending a troubling signal to American allies abroad.\n\nSince January, US officials have tried to broker the creation of a \"safe zone\" in northern Syria to provide a security buffer between the Turkish military and Kurdish forces, but Turkey has repeatedly objected to its slow implementation.\n\nThe White House announcement came a day after Erdogan offered the strongest warning yet of a unilateral military operation into northeastern Syria, as the Turkish military has been dispatching units and defence equipment to its border with the area.\n\n\"We have given all kinds of warning regarding the [area] east of the Euphrates to the relevant parties. We have acted with enough patience,\" Erdogan said.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces threatened to respond forcefully to any Turkish incursion.\n\n\"We will not hesitate to turn any unprovoked attack by Turkey into an all-out war on the entire border to DEFEND ourselves and our people,\" SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali tweeted at the weekend.\n\nA Kurdish official speaking on condition of anonymity said on Monday they expected a limited Turkish operation and were still working to ascertain what would happen with American forces in the region. The official said the view is that Kurdish-led forces have a legitimate right to self-defence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurkey considers the People's Protection Units, or YPG, an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has waged an insurgency against Turkey for 35 years.\n\nA senior US official said that American troops would pull back from the security zone in northeastern Syria, where they have been working with Turkish troops, to an unspecified out-of-the-way location.\n\nThe official added that if Turkey went ahead with the incursion into Syria, it was expected to trigger a large combat response from the SDF, and US troops would almost certainly withdraw completely from Syria.\n\nIn December, Trump announced he was withdrawing American troops from Syria but was met with widespread condemnation for abandoning Kurdish allies to the Turkish assault. The announcement prompted the resignation in protest of then-defence secretary Jim Mattis, and a coordinated effort by then-national security adviser John Bolton to try to protect the Kurds.\n\nUS defence leaders have long known that America would not get into an all-out war with Turkey, a NATO ally. But that has been stalled until now by aggressive negotiations by the US, urging Turkey against invading. The official said senior leaders never believed that the US would go to war to save the Kurds, but just hoped to put off that scenario.\n\nThe official said US leaders had spoken with the SDF and that the group, which has long fought alongside the US against IS, is disappointed and angry.\n\nMattis and other Pentagon leaders had worried that withdrawal would lead to a resurgence of IS in the country, particularly if the SDF abandoned the prisons holding the fighters to battle Turkey.\n\nThe White House statement said Turkey would take custody of foreign fighters captured in the US-led campaign against the Islamic State group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmbassador James Jeffrey, the State Department envoy to the international coalition fighting the Islamic State group, and Trump have said the Kurds have custody of thousands of captured Islamic State militants. They include about 2500 highly-dangerous foreign fighters from Europe and elsewhere whose native countries have been reluctant to take them back and another 10,000 or so captured fighters from Syria and Iraq.\n\nTrump has repeatedly demanded that European countries, particularly France and Germany, take back their citizens who joined the militant organisation.\n\nAAP", "description": "The US announcement will likely be seen as a long-feared abandonment of Kurdish allies who bore the brunt of the US-led campaign against the Islamic State militants.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_42/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c7f66182578fb438ba09e3612906f85065f98696", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
