When they don't go up -- you still make money (from the dividend). Heck, even when a dividend stock goes down in price, it's not all bad news, because the dividend yield (the absolute dividend amount, divided by the stock price) gets richer the more the stock falls in price.\n\nKnowing all this, wouldn't you like to own find great dividend stocks? Of course you would!\n\nAnd thanks to the Stock Screener at TipRanks, you can. In today's screen, we've sought out stocks receiving \"strong buy\" recommendations on Wall Street, with price targets significantly above where they trade today -- and dividend yields better than the S&P 500's average 2% yield.\n\nHere's what we've found:\n\nEnergizer (ENR)\n\nWith a stock price down 30% over the past year, you might think that Energizer is running out of juice -- but Wall Street begs to differ. TipRanks' survey of stock analyst ratings shows that, on average, Wall Street considers the world's second-most-famous battery maker a \"strong buy,\" and capable of delivering nearly 40% profit if it reaches its $60 consensus price target. (See ENR's price targets and analyst ratings on TipRanks)\n\nEnergizer's trailing profits have slipped from more than $200 million earned in 2017, to just $6.4 million earned over the last 12 months, hurt, as UBS analyst Steven Strycula explains, by \"early-stage integration setbacks\" of its Spectrum Auto Care subsidiary, and \"higher debt leverage.\"\n\nThat being said, the consensus of analysts who follow the stock is that Energizer will pull out a win this year, earning perhaps $1.96 per share -- then double that by 2021, when earnings are expected to climb to $3.95 per share. Strycula argued in August that the bear case on this stock is now fully \"priced-in,\" whereas the problems that have hurt earnings are \"fixable.\" At \"9.5x Consensus EBITDA\" with a 3% dividend yield, he thinks the stock is a 'buy'.\n\nEvercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein added, \"ENR screens as the most undervalued stock in our coverage, reflecting controversies over i) the strategic rationale of Energizer\u2019s diversification into Auto Care; ii) structural changes in the battery industry and whether a constructive pricing can be supported and; iii) risks of integration hiccups that could derail the delivery of financial targets.\"\n\nOttenstein has recently raised his price target on ENR to $60 (from $50), which implies nearly 50% upside from current levels. (To watch Ottenstein's track record, click here)\n\nDine Brands Global (DIN)\n\nIt's hard to find a stock with less sex appeal than batteries, but Dine Brands -- the restaurateur behind the IHOP and Applebee's chains -- is a close second. Regardless, Wall Street loves this stock as well, predicting the stock could rise as much as 50% over the next 12 months -- and for good reason.", "description": "Dividend stocks are the Swiss army knives of the stock market.When dividend stocks go up, you make money.
