I\u2019ve met people who like their doctors, I met people who like their nurses, I\u2019ve met people who like their pharmacists, I met people who like their physical therapists. What they want is access to health care,\u201d Warren said. \u201cLet us be clear, Joe, in the United States of America, we have spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on Earth,\u201d Sanders argued.\n\nIronically, it was another guy named \u2018Joe\u2019 who contradicted her. You might remember Joe from another thread we covered that he wrote \u2026 he also happens to be a doctor.\n\nI do @SenWarren. Six months ago my son went into heart failure. We drove him in the middle of a blizzard to Mayo Clinic. There, he was operated on by the Chief of Cardiovascular Surgery. Today, he is a normal boy. Blue Cross made sure he got exactly what he needed \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/XqSu0N7ddS \u2014 Joe Pilot, MD (@JoeSilverman7) September 13, 2019\n\nSide note, this editor loved the health insurance company who helped her daughter get the coverage she needed while in the NICU.\n\nWarren\u2019s claim is not a smart one.\n\nI never met anybody who likes any of the government agencies we are forced to to deal with, but thanks to idiot politicians like you Liz, we don\u2019t have a choice. \u2014 RosyRed VA Belle (@kt1varose629) September 13, 2019\n\nOuch.\n\nDear Sen. Warren (who won\u2019t ever read this):\n\nI have United Health Care through my employer and they have been wonderful in paying for my family\u2019s medical bills. I don\u2019t have problems with them. \u2014 Baseball and More (@Baseball_More) September 13, 2019\n\nOopsies.\n\nLying Elizabeth Warren! And she uses the old Obama phrase-Let\u2019s be clear! That phrase is a red flag-it means listen to me while I lie! \u2014 Mary Batson\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f (@SonsMary) September 13, 2019\n\nNext thing you know she\u2019ll claim we have 57 states.\n\nRelated:\n\nMeteorologist and PhD Ryan Maue mocks Democratic pres candidate\u2019s climate change rhetoric and it\u2019s GLORIOUS\n\n\u2018Oh just SHUT UP\u2019: AOC rampages after New Faces GOP\u2019s ad calls out her socialist BS, makes ironic claim about the GOP\n\nFor the WIN!
