The traffic officer had to rejoin the carriageway to pull her over.\n\nTests showed she had 71 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35mg.\n\nAt Stockport magistrates\u2019 court, Thornton, of Cheadle, Greater Manchester, admitted drink driving and was disqualified for 18 months.\n\nShe said she is now getting the bus to tournaments with the Manchester County Bridge Association.\n\nIn mitigation, defence lawyer John Dove said: 'She is someone who was up until today of extremely good character.\n\n'She worked as a teacher with a special needs school teaching children aged 11 to 19 years of age and progressed well in her career and got all the way to assistant head teacher.\n\n'This offence is something completely out of character for her - and she doesn't know why she had done it.'\n\nAt Stockport magistrates\u2019 court, Thornton, of Cheadle, Greater Manchester, admitted drink driving and was disqualified for 18 months.

If you do you will commit a serious offence and could be sent to prison and disqualified again.\n\n'You will have to reapply for your license again.'\n\nThornton was also fined \u00a3337 and was ordered to \u00a3283 in costs and surcharges.\n\nShe was also offered a place on a drink driving awareness course which could reduce the disqualification by 25%.", "description": "Grandmother Ann Thornton was found to be more than twice the alcohol limit after she was seen 'veering between lanes' at 40mph along the M56 near Manchester Airport on February 8.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/09/19682490-0-image-a-21_1571042209075.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
