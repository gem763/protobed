This is the second campaign. We had expectations it might have been in that $12 million to $13 million range. We brought the price down when we repositioned it for another EOI campaign. Initially, when we went to market, given that we didn\u2019t receive clear-cut contract at the original price point, it would probably be yes. It was slightly overpitched.\n\nIf there were people seeing extraordinary value at the upper end, it would have sold three-four months ago.\n\nThere was a greater-than-expected degree of hesitation among buyers, and the conditions they asked for, at a higher price range.\n\nWhat did you think it would go for? In that $10 million-plus bracket. 550 sq m is a reasonably small block for a house to be built on. There were properties behind and the side which potentially put some people off.\n\nWhat was surprising about it?\n\nThere has been more caution shown over last six-12 months and that is a result of what you have happening with the banks, APRA and a general slowdown. I was a little bit surprised, I would have thought the $10-million-to-$15 million properties were largely protected, as buyers are not having to rely so heavily on bank finance and funding.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen that in quite a long period. Even though the upper end is largely protected, obviously there are people that still need to borrow funds to make purchases at this sort of level.\n\nOne offer was conditional on finance. Others were on very long extended settlements. One was conditional on the sale of another property, which hasn\u2019t sold. There were conditions put in which we previously hadn\u2019t seen before. The owners were clear they wanted a straightforward cash transaction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWasn't it just the case that the vendor pitched it too high?\n\nIt could have been a position that the agents and developer - their optimism was a bit over the market.\n\nCutting the price guide widened the pool of buyers.\n\nWhen the vendor adjusted the quoted price down, it brought a whole spectrum of other buyers back into the market. A lot of buyers, when they see it advertised in the $12 million-to-$13 million-range, don\u2019t even bother to come and inspect. When we had readjusted to $10.5-million-to-$11.5 million, it brought a whole raft of new buyers to the property.\n\nDo you reckon we\u2019ll see another result like this: a) next week b) next year c) next cycle d) never?\n\nb) Next year. I think we\u2019re going to see a lot more results in this $10-million-to-$15-million range over the next 6-12 months. We\u2019re starting to see more people coming through.\n\nThere have been, and still appear to be, other properties in Toorak in that $10-million-to-$15-million range [that] have been there for quite a period of time.\n\nIt\u2019s either a function of something\u2019s wrong with the homes or it\u2019s a function of price and not attracting the right buyer.", "description": "Even Melbourne's very top end is hesitating and it's forcing vendors to come down.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6882%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_162/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/68c36e75dc192b31d76bcef46cc47b56adf1d37c", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
