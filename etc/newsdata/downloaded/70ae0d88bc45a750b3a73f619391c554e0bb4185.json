Over one and a half million households still say they will have to choose between heating and eating in order to pay their energy bills this winter. That's a terrifying prospect for anyone to have to face.\n\n'Energy companies need to do more to make customers aware if they're falling behind, and what their options for paying off the debt are, before people have to start making drastic decisions which could affect their health and wellbeing.\n\n'Likewise, more needs to be done to reform government support so that it's targeted at the most vulnerable households, where it will have the most benefit.'\n\nSaving money\n\nFor those looking to save money on their energy bills, switching supplier is a good option as there can be savings of up to \u00a3477 a year, according to uSwitch.\n\nCredit meter customers will need to clear any debt before switching provider unless it is less than 28 days old in which case it will be added to their final bill.\n\nIf the debt cannot be paid off in one go, switching to a supplier's cheapest deal can help bring costs down.\n\nPrepayment meter customers in debt by less than \u00a3500 per fuel can usually switch provider, but should still organise a manageable repayment plan.\n\nUsing debt charities, such as StepChange, can help households looking to get out of the red and will provide guidance for those experiencing financial difficulties.\n\nExtra help is also available for vulnerable customers through schemes like the Winter Fuel Payment, Cold Weather Payment, and Warm Home Discount.\n\nNeudegg added: 'Anyone worried about debt should speak with their energy supplier to set up a repayment plan, get energy saving advice, and check if they are eligible for free insulation or grants to help keep costs down.'", "description": "The debt averages at \u00a3115 per household, but is down overall by \u00a3126million - or 32 per cent - compared to last year, according to figures from uSwitch.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
