Powell, who was secretary of state under President George W. Bush, was much more than just horribly mistaken: He fabricated \u201cevidence\u201d and ignored repeated warnings that what he was saying was false.\n\nUnfortunately, Congress never investigated Powell\u2019s use of the intelligence he was given, so we don\u2019t know many of the specifics. Even so, what did reach the public record in other ways is extremely damning. While the corporate media has never taken a close look at this record, we can go through Powell\u2019s presentation line by line to demonstrate the chasm between what he knew and what he told the world. As you\u2019ll see, there\u2019s quite a lot to say about it.\n\nPowell\u2019s speech can be found on the State Department website here. All other sources are linked below.\n\nPublic Certainty, Private Doubt\n\nOn that February 5 in front of the U.N. Security Council, was Colin Powell certain what he was saying was accurate? He certainly was:\n\nPOWELL: My colleagues, every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources. These are not assertions. What we\u2019re giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence.\n\nLater, regarding whether Iraq had reconstituted a nuclear weapons program, he said:\n\nPOWELL: There is no doubt in my mind \u2026\n\nThat\u2019s in public. What about in private? According to Larry Wilkerson, Powell\u2019s chief of staff, here\u2019s what Powell was thinking at the time:\n\nWILKERSON: [Powell] had walked into my office musing and he said words to the effect of, \u2018I wonder how we\u2019ll all feel if we put half a million troops in Iraq and march from one end of the country to the other and find nothing.\u2019\n\nUnambiguous Lies\n\nThis is some of what Powell said about the infamous aluminum tubes purchased by Iraq, supposedly meant for their covert nuclear weapons program:\n\nPOWELL: It strikes me as quite odd that these [aluminum] tubes are manufactured to a tolerance that far exceeds U.S. requirements for comparable rockets. Maybe Iraqis just manufacture their conventional weapons to a higher standard than we do, but I don\u2019t think so.\n\nPowell\u2019s own intelligence staff, the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Intelligence and Research, prepared two memos commenting on drafts of the presentation. They were later quietly released as appendices to the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s report on WMD intelligence.\n\nThe second INR memo, written on February 3, 2003, told Powell this:\n\nOur key remaining concern is the claim that the tubes are manufactured to a tolerance that \u201cfar exceeds U.S. requirements for comparable rockets.\u201d In fact, the most comparable U.S. system is a tactical rocket \u2014 the U.S. Mark 66 air-launched 70mm rocket \u2014 that uses the same, high-grade (7075-T6) aluminum, and that has specifications with similar tolerances. Note that the Mk 66 specifications are unclassified, and the Department is planning to share them with the [International Atomic Energy Agency].\n\nFabricated Evidence\n\nPowell played an intercept of a conversation between Iraqi army officers about the U.N. inspections. However, when he translated what they were saying, he knowingly embellished it, turning it from evidence Iraq was complying with U.N. resolutions to evidence Iraq was violating them. This appears in Bob Woodward\u2019s book \u201cPlan of Attack\u201d:\n\nPowell had decided to add his personal interpretation of the intercepts to the rehearsed script, taking them substantially further and casting them in the most negative light. \u2026 Concerning the intercept about inspecting for the possibility of \u201cforbidden ammo,\u201d Powell took the interpretation further: \u201cClean out all of the areas. \u2026 Make sure there is nothing there.\u201d None of this was in the intercept.\n\nHere\u2019s the conversation as Powell presented it at the U.N. As Woodward reported, the bold sentences were simply added by Powell:\n\nPOWELL: \u201cThey\u2019re inspecting the ammunition you have, yes.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cFor the possibility there are forbidden ammo.\u201d \u201cFor the possibility there is by chance forbidden ammo?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAnd we sent you a message yesterday to clean out all of the areas yesterday to clean out all of the areas , the scrap areas, the abandoned areas. Make sure there is nothing there.\u201d\n\nPowell then explained:\n\nThis is all part of a system of hiding things and moving things out of the way and making sure they have left nothing behind.\n\nAccording to the official State Department translation (and confirmed for me by Imad Khadduri), the Iraqi soldier merely said:\n\n\u201cAnd we sent you a message to inspect the scrap areas and the abandoned areas.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s no surprise the Iraqi said this. Here\u2019s what the CIA\u2019s report on Iraq\u2019s nonexistent weapons of mass destruction found out about what was going on within the Iraqi government just before the January 30 intercepted conversation:\n\nThe NMD director met with Republican Guard military leaders on 25 January 2003 and advised them they were to sign documents saying that there was no WMD in their units, according to a former Iraqi senior officer. Husam Amin told them that the government would hold them responsible if UNMOVIC found any WMD in their units or areas, or if there was anything that cast doubt on Iraq\u2019s cooperation with UNMOVIC. Commanders established committees to ensure their units retained no evidence of old WMD.\n\nAgain: Powell took evidence of the Iraqis doing what they were supposed to do \u2014 \u009di.e., searching their gigantic ammunition dumps to make sure they weren\u2019t accidentally holding onto banned chemical weapons \u2014 \u009dand doctored it to make it look as if Iraq were hiding banned weapons.\n\nSince the State Department was questioned about this by journalist Gilbert Cranberg, the translation at variance with Powell\u2019s version has disappeared from its site. It\u2019s now available only via archive.org.\n\nDeception by Omission\n\nPowell\u2019s presentation left out extremely important information, as here:\n\nPOWELL: Iraq\u2019s record on chemical weapons is replete with lies. It took years for Iraq to finally admit that it had produced 4 tons of the deadly nerve agent, VX. A single drop of VX on the skin will kill in minutes. Four tons. The admission only came out after inspectors collected documentation as a result of the defection of Hussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein\u2019s late son-in-law.\n\nAs far as this went, this was accurate. However, Kamal, the head of Iraq\u2019s WMD programs, defected in 1995. Iraq had produced this VX before the Gulf War, in 1991 \u2014 \u009dand according to Kamel, Iraq had secretly destroyed it soon after the war. Then they lied about ever producing it (until his defection). But according to Kamel, they weren\u2019t lying when they said they no longer had it.\n\nIndeed, in the U.N.\u2019s notes from Kamel\u2019s debriefing, he says Iraq had no remaining WMD of any kind:\n\nKAMEL: All chemical weapons were destroyed. I ordered destruction of all chemical weapons. All weapons \u2014 biological, chemical, missiles, nuclear \u2014 were destroyed.\n\nAnd if that weren\u2019t enough, Kamel also said this in an interview on CNN with correspondent Brent Sadler:\n\nSADLER: Can you state here and now \u2014 does Iraq still to this day hold weapons of mass destruction? KAMEL: No. Iraq does not possess any weapons of mass destruction. I am being completely honest about this.\n\nBut in 1996, Kamel returned to Iraq, where he was killed by Saddam\u2019s regime. Thus the U.S. could safely take a witness who truthfully had said Iraq had no remaining banned weapons and pretend his testimony indicated the exact opposite.\n\nDid Powell know what he was doing at the time? It\u2019s unclear. Here\u2019s a transcript of an exchange between Powell and Sam Husseini of the Institute for Public Accuracy in Washington in December 2006, with video below:\n\nHUSSEINI: You cited Hussein Kamel in your U.N. testimony. Did you know he said there were no WMDs? POWELL: I only knew what the intelligence community told me. HUSSEINI: But did you know that fact? POWELL: Of course not! HUSSEINI: You didn\u2019t know that, even though it was reported? POWELL: I\u2019ve answered your question!\n\nAs you can see in the video, Powell was not happy to explore this line of questioning. (He\u2019s also never shown any inclination to find out who purportedly steered him wrong; when asked by Barbara Walters who was responsible for the mistakes in the overall presentation, Powell stated, \u201cI don\u2019t have the names.\u201d)", "description": "The evidence is irrefutable: Powell consciously deceived the world in his 2003 presentation making the case for war with Saddam Hussein.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/02/Colin-Powell-un-2003-1517923723.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90&fit=crop&w=1200&h=800", "published_at": "2018-02-06"}
