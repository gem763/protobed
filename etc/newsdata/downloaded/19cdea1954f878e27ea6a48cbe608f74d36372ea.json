I'm a pretty down to earth person, I've come from a normal family with normal jobs.\n\n\"I've worked hard and as far as I'm concerned I can spend my money on whatever I like.\n\n\"I never wanted to worry about paying for anything. I saw how much my mum struggled when we were growing up and I knew I didn't want to do that.\"\n\nLuke likes to post pictures of himself with sportscars, piles of cash and glasses of champagne. He now lives in Brough and makes up to \u00a350,000 a month.\n\nAnd now others are flocking to learn his online trading secrets - and they're willing to pay hundreds of pounds for the privilege.\n\n(Image: PIC BY CATERS NEWS)\n\nAfter dropping out of college he took out a \u00a31,000 loan, transforming his life with sheer will and determination - and a knack for trading.\n\nHe started out as an an apprentice at an IT firm - the place where he started on his trading path.\n\nHe now rakes in up to \u00a350,000 a month.\n\nLuke said: \"A few of my friends traded at the time and I thought 'why not, let's give it a go'.\n\n\"As I was trading, people were asking for help and I realised that I could make money that way too. All the while I was still working as an apprentice. I never thought it would take off to what it has done.\n\n\"My original goal was just to earn a few extra hundred pounds each month.\"\n\n(Image: CATERS)\n\nLuke's says growing up his parents struggled for money. He now makes sure they are secure financially and regularly offers to foot bills for them.\n\n\"My parents worked very hard to support our three brothers and always gave us whatever we needed,\" he said.\n\n\"My mum always said 'you need to do well' and definitely instilled a strong work ethic in me.\"\n\nLuke began to trade with his business partner and left his apprenticeship after one year to trade Forex full time.\n\nHe has now built a small business empire of rental properties, investments and claims to rake in between \u00a315,000 and \u00a350,000 a month through his trading and teaching business.\n\nHe travels across the world on exotic holidays as he only needs a laptop and internet connection in order to carry out his work.\n\nHe claims to own three buy-to-let properties, four luxury watches and frequently picks up bills for his parents and other family members.\n\n(Image: PIC BY CATERS NEWS)\n\nHe said: \"It's a difficult question to answer but once you add all of my assets up, I'm worth about \u00a31,000,000.\n\n\"Despite the money though the goal was never to become a millionaire. I just want to be stress free and comfortable. I don't want to worry about bills or anything like that.\n\n\"I can work wherever and whenever I want to. I don't need an office. All I need is a laptop and an internet connection.\"\n\nLuke said his main tip to any wannabe trader is not to get too stressed out when things are going badly. He said: \"It's great when things are going well but the crucial thing is how you react when things aren't going the way you planned.\n\n\"Don't rush, don't try and have a specific goal, just let it flow and don't put stress on yourself, don't take it too seriously.\n\n\"If it happens, it happens, if it doesn't it doesn't.\"", "description": "Luke Blackburn has become a millionaire trading Forex - not bad for a 'working class guy from Hull' who lecturers said would not amount to anything", "authors": ["Dan Kemp", "Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Pic Caters News", "Caters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20555799.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-FOREX-MILLIONAIRE-AT-22.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
