An anonymous whistleblower complaint released Thursday reported that Barr \u201cappears to be involved\u201d in Trump\u2019s push for a probe into the Bidens.\n\nThe complaint also alleges that White House officials were alarmed by Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, and later tried to \"lock down\" details of the conversation.\n\nThe Justice Department denied Wednesday that Barr had been asked to work with Ukraine on a Biden investigation, and a department spokeswoman told POLITICO the president never requested that the attorney general investigate Biden in a matter separate from the Ukraine scandal.\n\nThough the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general deemed the complaint\u2019s allegations credible and \u201curgent,\u201d acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire initially refused to turn over the document to Congress.\n\nMaguire acknowledged Thursday that he first discussed the complaint with the White House counsel\u2019s office before consulting with the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, which determined the complaint did not meet the legal definition of \u201curgent\u201d because Trump is not an employee of the intelligence community.\n\n\u201cTo have a Justice Department go so rogue \u2014 well, they had been for a while \u2014 and now it just makes matters worse that the attorney general was mentioned, that the president was mentioned, and yet the Justice Department directed the director of national intelligence to take this to the White House,\u201d Pelosi said Friday.\n\nMaguire has defended his management of the complaint, telling lawmakers Thursday: \u201cThis has never happened before. This is a unique situation.\u201d\n\nPelosi said Friday she \u201cfelt sorry\u201d for Maguire, but insisted he \u201cbroke the law\u201d by refusing to immediately provide the complaint to members of Congress. His decision to instead approach White House and Justice Department lawyers, she said, was \u201cnot highly unusual,\u201d but \u201cunique. Wrong.\u201d\n\nPelosi on Tuesday threw her support behind an impeachment inquiry into the president, declaring that Trump had perpetrated a \u201cbetrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c9/07/688b818a4b3ba24d2fc1060945b9/190927-nancy-pelosi-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
