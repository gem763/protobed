Really proud of the team, sixth title in a row is so impressive.\"\n\nWith Bottas holding a comfortable lead over the closing laps, there was a fierce battle for second place between Vettel and Hamilton.\n\nHamilton made a desperate attempt to pass Vettel over the final two laps but was unable to pull ahead. But the podium finishes for Bottas and Hamilton ensured Mercedes won their sixth-consecutive constructors' championship.\n\nVettel started from pole position but got off to a bad start. Race stewards investigated the German driver over a potential jump-start but ruled that he didn't'.\n\n\"The lights were on but it was my mistake,\" Vettel said. \"The Mercedes were difficult, they had more pace than us and Valtteri was flying.\"\n\nThere was contact between Leclerc and Red Bull driver Max Verstappen at Turn 2 and Verstappen was sent into a spin before being forced to retire early in the race.\n\nBottas made his first pit stop from the lead on the 18th lap to switch to medium tires as Hamilton took the lead for the first time.\n\nWith Hamilton on soft tires, Bottas had better pace on fresher rubber when he returned. Hamilton made his first pit stop on lap 22 and Bottas retook the lead.\n\nWhen he came back out, Hamilton was 20 seconds behind Bottas and questioned his team's tire strategy over the radio.\n\nBottas went in for his final pit stop on lap 37 and emerged into some traffic in second place behind Hamilton, who pitted with 10 laps remaining.\n\nBottas then held on for his first victory in Japan to slightly narrow Hamilton's commanding championship lead to 64 points with four races left.\n\nOrganizers canceled Saturday's qualifying session with Typhoon Hagibis set to hit Japan's main island. Vettel led Ferrari teammate Leclerc in morning qualifying to secure the front row for Ferrari.\n\nQualifying at Suzuka was also moved to Sunday morning as a result of bad weather in 2004 and 2010.\n\nRed Bull driver Alexander Albon, who has impressed since his promotion from Toro Rosso to the senior team in August, finished a season-high fourth while McLaren's Carlos Sainz Jr. was fifth ahead of Leclerc.\n\nRenault driver Daniel Ricciardo was a lowly 16th in the morning qualifying but the Australian converted that to an impressive seventh-place finish ahead of Toro Rosso's Pierre Gasly. Sergio Perez of Racing Point was ninth while the second Renault of Nike Hulkenberg rounded out the top ten.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
