(It's dirty work - but someone had to try it)", "language": "en", "text": "As I walk to Debbie Thomas\u2019s skincare clinic at the back of Harrods, in one of the most congested areas of central London, I can practically feel my pores clogging up.\n\nQuite apart from the effect the fumes are having on our lungs and the planet, pollution is a major cause of skin damage and premature ageing \u2014 no surprise, it\u2019s also the beauty industry\u2019s latest obsession.\n\nSkincare brands are putting serious investment into pollution shield technology, with beauty giants such as Elizabeth Arden and No7 making it the focal of launches this year.\n\nMany brands are looking to one particular ingredient to revolutionise their offerings \u2014 charcoal. At the centre of the launch of Amazon\u2019s first own-brand skincare range, Belei, last week, is Deep Charcoal Cleansing Mask (\u00a312), and when cult U.S. skincare line Boscia finally landed on our shores at the end of last year, it\u2019s first offering was its detoxifying charcoal range.\n\nVictoria Woodhall (pictured in charcoal mask) gave her verdict on a carbon peel from Debbie Thomas\u2019s skincare clinic in Harrods\n\nCharcoal\u2019s powerful ability to absorb impurities has seen it make the leap from slightly fringe whitening toothpastes and cleansing drinks to mainstream face washes, masks and even scalp scrubs.\n\nNow, it is being incorporated into salon treatments in the battle against environmental nasties.\n\nDebbie Thomas is known as the queen of lasers. She\u2019ll lift your knees with them, zap your spots and even hoik up your cheeks with a beam inside your mouth. She is among the first to offer the carbon peel, combining the power of a laser beam with charcoal, which she regards as the ultimate glow-getting combo.\n\nThe carbon peel is a deep cleanse for dull, city-stressed skin, and involves having a pitch-black charcoal paste painted onto your face and then \u2018erased\u2019 with a laser. Charcoal is a supremely simple and effective skin detoxer, says Debbie, as it aborbs impurities like a magnet as it dries.\n\nShe then uses a special laser to blast the mask to pieces. The treatment is also known as the Hollywood peel as it\u2019s a popular pre-red carpet fix.\n\nI\u2019m surprised celebs would go anywhere near a peel or a laser before a flashbulb event, but Debbie says this treatment comes with no downtime or redness and gives an instant glow.\n\nIt\u2019s also proving popular, Debbie has noticed, with women prepping for their 50th birthdays. \u2018They say they want to look a bit fresher, as if to say \u201cI\u2019ve got this\u201d.\u2019\n\nWhat is it about turning 50 and suddenly noticing your pores seem larger?\n\nThe carbon peel involves having a charcoal paste painted onto your face and then \u2018erased\u2019 with a laser (pictured), to help with cleaning off dead skin\n\n\u2018As we get older and lose collagen, people start to notice their pores more than they used to. It\u2019s the collagen around the pore that plumps it up and squishes it shut,\u2019 she says.\n\nDebbie says the carbon peel can help with this to a degree, because the laser creates a little shock of heat, which can stimulate collagen. But there are other lasers which stimulate the deeper layers and can be combined with the carbon peel.\n\nBut what the carbon peel will do is clean off dead skin, which is slower to shed as we get older, and purge the pores so your skin looks tight and glowy.\n\nI\u2019m still to be convinced because, on paper, it sounds very Guy Fawkes \u2014 Debbie warns me to expect firecracker noises and gunpowder smells when she blasts the charcoal face mask into oblivion with her beam. But the results, I\u2019m assured, will be worth it.\n\nWhen the charcoal paste dries on the skin, it sticks to the oil, dirt and dead skin cells. These are the things that clog and enlarge pores and make the skin look grubby and dull.\n\n\u2018When the laser hits the carbon, it goes up in a puff of smoke taking all the stuff that is stuck to it as well. So, you get this bright, soft face and your pores look far more refined.\u2019\n\nVictoria was told by Debbie that she's a perfect candidate for a carbon peel, as her complexion was looking dull and her T-zone needed attention\n\nAlthough my skin is generally good, I\u2019m a perfect candidate for this treatment. My complexion is looking dull and Debbie says that the pores on my T-zone could do with a little attention, especially as I cycle polluted streets on my commute and regularly wear an SPF 50 to keep wrinkles at bay.\n\n\u2018For you, I want to deposit enough energy from the laser to get you a little bit of plumpness,\u2019 says Debbie, \u2018which will help to soften some of the fine lines, and definitely work on the brightness to get a glow back into the skin. If your skin is glowing and luminous, everything looks better.\u2019\n\nSo to business. She tucks me under a blanket on the treatment couch, applies the black paste which dries in minutes and gives me dark glasses to protect my eyes. Will it hurt?\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like the flicking of an elastic band,\u2019 she says. \u2018It\u2019s not painful; more annoying \u2014 you almost want to swat it away.\u2019\n\nHer beam fires superfast blasts as it works its way over the charcoal, vaporising as it goes. It smells like burned toast, and I\u2019m surprised at how loud the crackling is. It isn\u2019t hot, but it\u2019s most certainly prickly and the area under the nose is especially sensitive. But I\u2019d take this over eyebrow threading any day.\n\nVictoria says her face appeared more plump after the treatment, a carbon peel can improve skin health with six-to-eight sessions\n\nAs an aside, Debbie tells me this is the same \u2018Q-Switch\u2019 laser that\u2019s traditionally used for tattoo removal, because it can shatter dark ink. Yikes, mind my microbladed eyebrows, they cost 300 quid! But, of course, Debbie is careful. And it\u2019s not just women who love this treatment. It\u2019s popular with men, too, and is her 53-year-old husband\u2019s favourite guilty secret.\n\nThe whole thing is over in 15 minutes and, with a slather of antioxidant vitamin C serum and suncream, I\u2019m good to go and indeed am glowing.\n\nMy face is more plump and, as the magnifying mirror testifies the next day, everything does look squeaky clean.\n\nWhile extractions (ie, squeezing) are still the only thing that will get rid of blackheads immediately, this will help prevent them. I\u2019m happy to be keeping on top of pollution particles, which can penetrate the cells and cause oxidative stress, in the same way sun damage does.\n\nAs a one-off treatment, the results are instant, but with six-to-eight sessions you can really help improve skin health, which takes this beyond a mere pamper treatment. For me, this is a facial that is rightly having a moment. In the battle against pollution, this is one gunpowder plot I can get on board with.\n\nCarbon Laser is available with the DNA Laser Complete Grade 2 Facial, from \u00a3120, at D.Thomas Clinic (dthomas.com)", "description": "Victoria woodhall gave her verdict on the carbon peel from Debbie Thomas's skincare clinic in Harrods.
