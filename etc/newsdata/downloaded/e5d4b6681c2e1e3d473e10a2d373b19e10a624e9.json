A steeper curve typically indicates expectations of stronger growth.\n\nThe yield curve rose to 37 basis points on Tuesday, its steepest level since July.\n\nNegative yields\n\nThe value of negatively yielding bonds across the globe has also fallen to $US13.4 trillion - its lowest since July - after peaking at $US17 trillion in late August.\n\n\"Bond markets are really playing with this idea that the bottom is now and so yields have bounced pretty solidly, and in some cases quite violently, off their lows,\" said AustralianSuper's manager of fixed income strategy, Katie Dean.\n\n\"Some are now thinking 'maybe global growth will be a bit better this year and next year' and that will support asset prices.\"\n\nWhile net exports have been strong thanks to high iron ore prices, Australia's growth has been hamstrung by last year's downturn in the housing market, fragile consumer sentiment, disappointing retail sales, and weak business investment. The expected stimulus from the government's tax cuts has disappointed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe RBA has delivered three cuts of 25 basis points each at its June, July and October meetings. Some economists expect another rate cut in February.\n\n\"The data is still weak but we haven't had the potential for the data to flow through yet,\" said Nikko Asset Management fixed income portfolio manager Chris Rands.\n\n\"If they've cut rates and the housing market starts to run it will take a few months for the data to turn around. You might see the RBA get a bit more positive in the first part of the new year as that flows through.\"\n\nPoliticians are also more positive on the global economy.\n\nMr Frydenberg told The Australian Financial Review on Monday economic managers in Washington were ''upbeat about their economy\" and the global economy remained sound.\n\nBut some economists and fixed income managers suggest Mr Frydenberg's comments and the bond market may be too optimistic.\n\n\"We're certainly not in recession but suggesting all is well in the global economy would be very much overstating the case,\" said IFM Investors chief economist Alex Joiner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeized upon\n\n\"Bond and equity markets are responding to the news flow and any snippet of positive news they can latch on to has been seized upon, and that's why we're seeing some positivity in markets.\"\n\nFixed income managers are expecting the rally in yields will be short-lived as investors return their attention to the economic fundamentals which, while stabilising, have yet to show evidence of actual improvement.\n\n\"While the dark cloud has blown away, it's still grim out there and economies are still performing pretty poorly,\" said Jamieson Coote Bonds chief investment officer Charlie Jamieson.\n\n\"We only need to look at the leading markets where the numbers are utterly horrific.\"\n\nIn September, South Korean exports fell 11.7 per cent year-on-year, Japan's dropped 5.2 per cent and Taiwan's declined 4.6 per cent, a sign the world's factories are suffering from subdued demand.\n\n\"These are gargantuan swings,\" Mr Jamieson said. \"If that's the leading economies, it does not bode well for the global picture.\"\n\nHe also suggested the bond market rally had been, in part, an overreaction to being overbought through August and September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharlie Jamieson says Asia's export data is flashing a warning. Daniel Munoz\n\nOverreaction\n\n\"There's no question the market position was trading long and was vulnerable to a wash-out,\" Mr Jamieson said.\n\n\"It has been the perfect environment for momentum-based algorithm accounts to push on the bond market.\"\n\nEven if optimism around global growth made its way through bond markets, that positivity would take some time to feed through to the real economy.\n\n\"There are waters here to navigate that are just uncertain, and that's not great for business investment,\" said Altius Asset Management senior portfolio manager Chris Dickman.\n\n\"Everyone in the markets can say 'I've changed my mind now and I'll go buy something or sell something', whereas if you're a business and you have uncertainty it's hard to unwind what you've just decided, so you don't do anything.\"\n\nA rally in yields is likely to be further capped by the prospect of unconventional monetary policy, with demand for bonds likely to rise if the RBA undertook quantitative easing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIFM Investors chief economist Alex Joiner says the Treasurer is being too optimistic. Wayne Taylor\n\nWestpac chief economist Bill Evans said the market had started to price in the probability of quantitative easing, based on the historic relationship between the cash rate and the 10-year bond yield.\n\nThe spread had historically moved between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent, but narrowed to between 60 basis points and 70 basis points.\n\n\"One factor there is the market is expecting the RBA to come in and buy bonds, so that will hold down that spread. So I think that in a way QE is already priced into the market,\" Mr Evans said.", "description": "The sharp improvement in sentiment in the bond market suggests the global and domestic economies have turned a corner, but some managers say it's an illusion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4cad6796ca6bd7ee71729d2e41e4cdb9d4a455c9", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
