Ohlendorf. Alicea and Ohlendorf argue that the tiers of scrutiny\u2014strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and rational-basis review\u2014that have come to dominate so much of what passes for constitutional analysis are illegitimate: They \u201chave no basis in the text or original meaning of the Constitution,\u201d and \u201cthey do not withstand critical analysis even on their own terms.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe authors explain the \u201ccurious history\u201d of the tiers of scrutiny, a \u201crevolution in constitutional law [that] happened not for reasons of principle and fidelity to the original meaning of the Constitution\u201d but rather \u201cfor reasons of contingency and political expediency.\u201d The Supreme Court (to use their quote of Harvard law professor Richard Fallon) long \u201cconceived its task as marking the conceptual boundaries that defined spheres of state and congressional power on the one hand and of private rights on the other.\u201d The tiers of scrutiny developed only in the mid-20th century \u201cas a means to evade the categorical language of the Free Speech Clause,\u201d and they then morphed into \u201cthe Warren Court\u2019s dominant method of muscularly protecting its favored constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nAlicea and Ohlendorf argue that \u201cit is in the very nature of the tiers of scrutiny that they contradict the constitutional provisions in question, by purporting to find those rights \u2018outweighed\u2019 by the government\u2019s interest in violating them.\u201d This scrutiny analysis \u201casks judges to impose on the Constitution a hierarchy of values and interests that\u2014due to their incommensurability\u2014is not objectively justifiable.\u201d\n\nThey continue:\n\nBut one need not be an originalist to reject the tiers of scrutiny; any good-faith interpreter of the Constitution can\u2014and should\u2014just as readily condemn them. That is because the tiers of scrutiny lack the essential characteristic of any jurisprudential test whose aim is the faithful application of the law: serving as a meaningful guide to legal analysis. Instead, each step of the scrutiny process is marked by indeterminacy and manipulability.\n\nBecause the scrutiny analysis depends a judge\u2019s \u201cown subjective assessment of questions that can only be described as quintessentially political,\u201d it \u201cmakes the resolution of controversial constitutional questions difficult for the losing side to accept.\u201d\n\nThere is a lot more in this rich and thoughtful essay. I agree with the authors that the \u201cRoberts Court would have few accomplishments of greater significance than the repudiation of the tiers of scrutiny.\u201d", "description": "That\u2019s the title of an outstanding National Affairs essay by Joel Alicea and John D.
