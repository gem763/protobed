Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\n\nBoth Warren and Sanders, who unveiled his proposal earlier this week, have released sweeping plans to tax the wealth of the richest Americans, while also advocating for significant taxes on corporations, Wall Street and estates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but an aide told the Post that the campaign is working on a tax policy proposal.\n\nBiden \u201chas and will continue to put forward details regarding how he will finance his biggest plans, because the stakes are too high not to be straightforward with the American people about how much they will cost and who will pay for them,\u201d Andrew Bates, a campaign spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nTax experts said the fact that Biden is considering this new tax is evidence that he\u2019s trying to keep polling to the left to not lose support with progressives -- and could be more worried about his frontrunner status than he appears, as Warren climbs up the polls.\n\n\u201cI think that would complicate his relationship with other Democratic voters as well,\u201d Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, told FOX Business. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely trying to pick a new populist approach to pick up some new voters.\u201d\n\nIn trying to pick up those new voters, however, Biden risks alienating more moderate Democrats, as well as donors on Wall Street, Zaccarelli warned. That\u2019s because a tax on Wall Street extends to almost every American who, either through a pension, 401(k) or other type of indirect equity ownership is going to pay those taxes.\n\n\u201cThose costs ultimately are borne by retirees and other savers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will hit everyone, despite the fact that it will obviously disproportionately hit people who are more active in the stock market ... It\u2019s not something that will only be borne by the wealthiest Americans.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "If Biden moves forward with the proposal, it would mark a significant leftward shift in his campaign.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/Biden-Thumb.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
