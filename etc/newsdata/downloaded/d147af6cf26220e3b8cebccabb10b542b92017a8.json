If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nWith the holidays coming up, most of us are going to be busy bees trying to shop for gifts and do festive activities while balancing work, finances, and our social lives. The last thing you'll want to add to your plate (pun intended) is worrying about what to make for dinner. Luckily, meal kits are a thing, and can help you waste less time, energy, and food in the kitchen. If you've been thinking about trying out one of these services, right now you can get a sweet discount on our absolute favorite meal kit out there.\n\nThis year, when we tested all the most popular meal kits (Blue Apron, HelloFresh, Plated etc.), we chose Home Chef as our absolute top pick, which is why we're thrilled to present our readers with an awesome discount on their supremely tasty meal kits. Right now you can save $20 on each of your first four boxes with Home Chef (a total $80 in savings!) by clicking our link. The coupon should be applied automatically, but just in case anything goes awry, just enter in the code REVIEWED80 at checkout.\n\nWe did the math based on their $9.95 per serving charge, so you're essentially getting two meals for free each week no matter the number of meals or servings you decide to get. Who can honestly say no to a free meal?\n\nIn our testing, we found that Home Chef bested its competitors due to its high-quality ingredients, creative recipes, and bold, tasty flavors. Our tester even went so far as to say that she felt that the meals were restaurant-worthy, yet super easy to make, with many taking less than 30 minutes to prepare from start to finish. They also offer a ton of variety to choose from, with 16 dinner options per week, as well as a diverse set of lunch and snack choices as add-ons to its main menu. Plus, if you truly want to feel like you're eating a meal worthy of a Michelin star, you have the option to upgrade your protein or choose from their premium meal selection for an additional cost.\n\nInstead of slaving over the stove this holiday season, you can make your life a little easier with Home Chef, and get fresh, quality meal kits delivered right to your door. That way, you get to do what the holidays are actually meant for\u2014decorating, drinking, and spending quality time with family and friends.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
