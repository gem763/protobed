Earlier this month, the Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly committed to such an inquiry.\n\n\u201cFor those of us who from a young age have had to endure and put up with being called names such as towelhead or Taliban or coming from Bongo-Bongo Land, we can appreciate the hurt and pain felt by already vulnerable Muslim women when they are described as looking like bank robbers and letterboxes.\u201d\n\nABCNews.com\n\nDhesi\u2019s comments come two days after non-profit The MAMA Project, which measures anti-Muslim attacks in the U.K., issued a report in which they said there was a spike in incidents reported to them after Johnson\u2019s column was published -- from eight incidents the previous week to 38 anti-Muslim attacks the week following publication.\n\nJohnson\u2019s August column, titled \u201cDenmark has got it wrong.

He also compared women who choose to cover their faces to bank robbers.\n\nHis remarks prompted dozens of complaints and he was called on to apologize by Theresa May, the Prime Minister and head of the Conservative party at the time, the BBC reported. However, a panel convened to assess whether he had broken the Conservative code of conduct found that he had not.\n\nVictim Support, another British non-profit organization who assist victims of hate crimes told ABC News that in 2018 they \u201coffered information and support to around 25,000 people who had experienced hate crime, the majority of which was racially or religiously motivated, which is an increase of 23% on the previous year.\u201d\n\nDiana Fawcett, Chief Executive of Victim Support said that \u201cWe know that hate crime is still underreported and one of the main reasons is that victims fear they won\u2019t be taken seriously.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister, who has only been in the job since July, refused to apologize for his remarks saying that \u201cIf he took the trouble to read the article in question, he would see that it was a strong liberal defense \u2026 of everybody\u2019s right to wear whatever he wants in this country.\u201d\n\nJohnson went on to say that he had Muslim ancestors and was related to Sikhs while retorting that the Labour Party should look into its own history of anti-Semitism.", "description": "Sikh Member of Parliament demanded an apology for\u201dracist\u201d comments Johnson made in a newspaper column comparing burka-wearing Muslim to letter boxes bank robbers", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/WNT/190904_wn_longman_644_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
