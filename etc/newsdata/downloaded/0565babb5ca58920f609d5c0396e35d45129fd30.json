We are pleased that the court saw through the noise.\"\n\nCharles claimed his proposed project, Two Stupid Guys in a Stupid Car Driving to a Stupid Town, was pitched in 2002 to Seinfeld, with whom he had worked since 1994.\n\nThe pilot for Comedians in Cars was directed by Charles in October 2011, but the pair's relationship was said to have broken down after Charles sought more credit and compensation than Seinfeld wanted to give.\n\n\"We are, of course, disappointed,\" Peter Skolnik, a lawyer for Charles, said in a statement to Reuters. He also criticised Seinfeld's alleged \"egregious, shabby conduct\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Chris Rock and Ellen Degeneres have both appeared on Comedians in Cars\n\nComedians in Cars Getting Coffee sees a different guest comedian join Jerry Seinfeld in a vintage car each episode.\n\nTogether, the pair go for a drive, record their conversations, and stop for coffee in a pre-selected restaurant or cafe.\n\nGuests have included Chris Rock, Ricky Gervais, Tina Fey, Kevin Hart and Ellen DeGeneres. However, non-comedians have occasionally appeared too, such as former US president Barak Obama.\n\nThe show began broadcasting on Sony's digital network Crackle, but moved to Netflix last year, for its 10th season.\n\n\"Charles believed that 'Seinfeld would eventually acknowledge Charles' authorship and ownership and bring him in,'\" Judge Nathan wrote, quoting from the complaint.\n\n\"Because Charles was on notice that his ownership claim had been repudiated since at least 2012, his infringement claim is time-barred.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
