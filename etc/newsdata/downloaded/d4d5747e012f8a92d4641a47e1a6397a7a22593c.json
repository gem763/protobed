USA TODAY\n\nSaddled with an 0-5 record and sagging attendance at home games, the Washington Redskins on Monday made the long-anticipated move of firing head coach Jay Gruden.\n\nThe first coach fired in the NFL this season, Gruden was the longest-tenured leader in Daniel Snyder\u2019s 20 seasons as owner of Washington\u2019s football team. But in six campaigns, he produced a 35-49-1 record, only two winning records and just one playoff appearance.\n\nIn a familiar theme, the Redskins were plagued by poor execution on both sides of the ball, a lack of discipline, debilitating injuries, a poor culture and division among the team\u2019s top decision-makers.\n\nOnce again, this long-dysfunctional franchise finds itself hitting the reset button as team president Bruce Allen announced on Monday that offensive line coach Bill Callahan has been promoted to interim head coach.\n\nCallahan, who joined the team in 2015, finds himself in a difficult position as he inherits the same problems while trying to figure out how to fix a team that ranks fifth-worst in both total offense and defense.\n\nHe\u2019ll try to restore order and coax winning ways out of this bunch. But in-season firings rarely produce dramatic turnarounds in the NFL.\n\nSo the priority for the next 12 weeks should be one thing: the development of quarterback Dwayne Haskins.\n\nMore: 32 things we learned from Week 5 of the 2019 NFL season\n\nWeek 5 winners, losers: Christian McCaffrey posting big numbers for Panthers; Jets, not so much\n\nThe No. 15 pick of this year\u2019s draft, Haskins dazzled in his one season as a starter at Ohio State and was a finalist for the Heisman Trophy. However, the Redskins were never on the same page regarding the quarterback. While Snyder, Allen and other members of the front office saw him as the answer for their long-running instability at quarterback, Gruden did not. That\u2019s partly because the coach knew he was entering this season needing a winning record to save his job. He didn\u2019t have time to develop a quarterback.\n\nThroughout training camp, the preseason and start of the regular season, Gruden maintained that Haskins wasn\u2019t equipped to play at a high level in the NFL.\n\nCoaches have two choices when working with a rookie quarterback: They can strip down their offense and tailor it to the young player's strengths to get him on the field as quickly as possible, or they can continue to run their offense with a veteran and keeping the rookie on the bench.\n\nGruden opted for the latter by going with Case Keenum, only playing Haskins for a portion of the Week 4 loss to the Giants in which the rookie throwing three interceptions before returning to the bench on Sunday.\n\nNow, however, Callahan and offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell now must determine the best way to handle Haskins.\n\nAt his first news conference Monday, Callahan made it clear he agrees Haskins isn\u2019t ready to start.\n\n\u201cNot right now. But he will be at some point in time,\u201d said Callahan, whose first game in his new role comes Sunday against the winless Dolphins. \u201cWe're going to continue to develop him and heighten his maturation process.\"\n\nIt does, however, sound like it\u2019s a matter of when, not if, Haskins does move into that leading role. Callahan repeatedly said he believes the young passer is the team\u2019s future.\n\nHowever, since joining the team in the spring, the rookie has had to learn an approach and responsibilities that differ greatly from what he was asked to do while running Ohio State\u2019s spread offense in 2018. He has had to learn how to diagnose more complex defenses and run and pass concepts as well as memorize wordy and intricate play calls.\n\nAs a backup, Haskins has received only limited snaps in Washington\u2019s offense. Instead, his duties have involved running the scout team offense while watching Keenum and then Colt McCoy direct Washington\u2019s first stringers.\n\nWhether it's for upcoming games against the 49ers or Vikings or some later date, Callahan wants Haskins equipped. He said he plans to find ways to make Haskins comfortable quickly even though there are only so many practice reps to go around.\n\nPeople both inside and outside of the organization familiar with Haskins\u2019 game scoff at the notion he is far away from being game-ready. When reports surfaced Monday morning alleging that Haskins still can\u2019t call plays in the huddle or read defenses, two different people familiar with team called those claims \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cuntrue.\u201d They spoke to USA TODAY Sports on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak for the organization.\n\nThey also believe that with the right game plan, Haskins can compete as a rookie.\n\nCallahan didn\u2019t reveal a timeline for starting Haskins, noting only that he wants him to have \"a package of plays that he can go out and execute and know that they are his and have ownership of those plays.\u201d\n\nCallahan\u2019s philosophy of placing a greater emphasis on the run game could position Haskins for greater success.\n\nTo date, Washington ranks second-to-last in rushing attempts per game (17.6). Gruden has always preferred a pass-first approach. But establishing the run game can ease pressure on both a battered offensive line and the quarterback. Callahan stressed Washington can improve in this area, and he aims to feature running back Adrian Peterson more prominently. And if Washington can indeed regain effectiveness on the ground, that will put Haskins \u2014 or whomever the team starts at quarterback \u2014 in more manageable third-down situations.\n\nThis may be a passing league, but the success of teams like the 49ers, Seahawks, Ravens, Colts, Cowboys, Bills, Panthers and Jaguars serves as proof that healthy rushing attacks can indeed lead to overall success on offense. And in several of those cases, an effective ground game has helped young still-developing quarterbacks succeed on the fly.\n\nAt 0-5, of course, Redskins players, coaches and decision-makers would love to see some wins. But in truth, the season is lost. Positioning Haskins to play sooner rather than later would translate into a stronger foundation for the rookie while also providing the necessary evaluation opportunities that Washington officials need as they try to determine yet again what direction they should go.\n\nFollow Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
