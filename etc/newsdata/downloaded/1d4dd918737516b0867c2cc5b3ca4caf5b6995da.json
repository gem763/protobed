On Monday, British model-turned-acress Agyness Deyn made a return to the Burberry runway during London Fashion Week after an extended hiatus.\n\nYou might remember Deyn for her signature bleach-blonde pixie cut, which was on every runway and every billboard in the mid-2000s. In 2007, she was named one of \u201cThe World\u2019s Next Top Models\u201d by American Vogue, alongside Doutzen Kroes, Caroline Trentini, Raquel Zimmermann, Sasha Pivovarova, Jessica Stam, Coco Rocha, Hilary Rhoda, Chanel Iman, and Lily Donaldson. Vogue Paris named her one of the top 30 models of the decade. She was the Paris Hilton of British punk, a living, breathing Dr. Marten.\n\nAnd then she quit.\n\nIn 2008, a Cut headline read \u201cBurberry Dropped Agyness Deyn Because She\u2019s Too Famous?\u201d According to the U.K.\u2019s Metro, photographer Mario Testino, Burberry\u2019s \u201cadvertising visionary,\u201d was sick of seeing her face. Lovely! The following year, the Daily Mirror reported that Deyn quit modeling to spend more time with her then boyfriend, singer-songwriter Miles Kane. Maybe she was bored, a source speculated. Maybe she wanted to pursue acting. (She went on to land a handful of roles, most recently in Her Smell.) Either way, she was out.\n\nIn 2012, Deyn officially \u201cretired\u201d from modeling, telling The Independent that her feelings toward the industry had changed. \u201cI didn\u2019t hate it, but I was yearning to do something different,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t hate it! Always a good sign.\n\nWell, now she\u2019s back \u2014 this time, walking for Riccardo Tisci\u2019s new Burberry. The designer has made a concerted effort to modernize the British heritage brand, and what better face than Deyn herself. The only difference is that now, she seems to have a bleached-blonde mullet. Here she comes, 2020!", "description": "On Monday, British model-turned-acress Agyness Deyn made a return to the Burberry runway during London Fashion Week after an extended hiatus.
