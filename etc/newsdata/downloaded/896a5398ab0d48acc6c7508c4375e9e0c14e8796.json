I have been dating a guy for the past few months now named Maurice,' she explained.\n\n'In the past two weeks, everyone's realised he's not in my socials and then boom he's on this dating show,' the visibly-irate blonde huffed.\n\n'My boyfriend dumped me for Love Island Australia!' Maurice Salib's ex-girlfriend Christie Swadling (pictured) claims he left her TWO WEEKS before going on the show - despite him saying he's been single for six months\n\nShe proceeded to claim that Maurice had lied in his official Love Island bio when he claimed he's been single for six months.\n\n'Did he lie in his bio? Yes. We were together within that [six month] time-frame,' she declared.\n\nShe then turned to the question of whether she knew Maurice would be on Love Island before he dumped her.\n\nIt's war! Christie savagely labelled Maurice (picured) as 'trash' on Instagram during Monday night's premiere\n\n'I had no idea he was going on the dating show, whatsoever. But he came to me while we were together saying that [Channel Nine had] asked him to go on the [television] ad [for Love Island].'\n\nExplaining that Maurice has always had aspirations to become an actor, Christie said she didn't hesitate to encourage him to appear in the advertisement.\n\n'He's wanted to be an actor, he does a little bit of acting as a side job. When the ad was released, everyone was messaging me saying, 'Oh my god is Maurice going on Love Island?' And I was like, 'No it's just the ad he's just an actor,'' she explained.\n\nWe were together within that time-frame!' In the video she claimed that Maurice had lied in his official Love Island bio when he claimed he's been single for six months\n\n'About one week after he's gone on this ad, he's broken it off with me!' she exclaimed, adding that his sudden dumping was 'completely out of the blue'.\n\n'His excuse was saying that he puts work first and he can't really prioritise me,' she said.\n\nThe social media star then addressed the question of whether Maurice had applied to appear on Love Island Australia while they were still dating.\n\n'He's wanted to be an actor!' Explaining that Maurice (right) has always had aspirations to become an actor, Christie (left) said she didn't hesitate to encourage him to appear in the advertisement\n\nPointing out that the show is based in Fiji, Christie said: 'You have to apply for your visa two weeks before you travel there.'\n\n'Maurice would have had to apply for his visa, keep his passport and apparently you even have to apply for the Love Island position itself months in advance.'\n\n'So if that is all the case he would have 100 per cent have had to apply for this while we were together,' she added.\n\nChristie also accused Maurice of being fame hungry, but insisted that he's not a 'bad person'.\n\n'I know his intentions were never to hurt me': Christie also accused Maurice of being fame hungry, but insisted that he's not a 'bad person'\n\n'This guy loved fame, loved it! And as soon as he's had any chance to have more fame, to be able to put himself out there, he\u2019s just taken it,' she said.\n\n'I know his intentions were never to hurt me, hence why he\u2019s broken it off with me and then gone on this show.'\n\nMaurice features prominently on Christie's Instagram page, and is seen in various amorous poses with the blonde.\n\nThe last photo of the couple was uploaded to her page in August.", "description": "The showdown between Love Island Australa's\u00a0Maurice\u00a0Salib and his blogger ex-girlfriend Christie Swalding has taken a bitter turn.", "authors": ["Monique Friedlander For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/03/19422662-0-image-a-44_1570501015598.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
