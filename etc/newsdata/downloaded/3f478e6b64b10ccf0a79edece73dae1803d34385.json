Since then, two more women have been added to the list: Saint Therese of Lisieux and Saint Hildegard of Bingen.\n\nThe latest saint to be declared a doctor was the tenth-century Armenian monk Gregory of Narek, recognized as \u201cdoctor of the Church\u201d by Pope Francis on February 21, 2015.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "The Catholic bishops of Poland have asked Pope Francis to declare Saint John Paul II a \u201cdoctor of the Church.\u201d", "authors": ["Thomas D.
