Read more\n\nHis remarks came as the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, became the first prominent European politician to suggest it was \u201cnot very credible\u201d that the attack was mounted by the Houthis, as the rebels engaged in the civil war in Yemen have claimed.\n\nFrance has sent intelligence analysts to examine \u2013 alongside UN experts \u2013 the Saudi claims that the attack came from the north using technology and weaponry only available to Iran.\n\nZarif\u2019s threat of conflict in an interview with CNN appeared to be in response to the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who referred to the attack as an \u201cact of war\u201d.\n\n\u201cI make a very serious statement about defending our country,\u201d Zarif said. \u201cI am making a very serious statement that we don\u2019t want to engage in a military confrontation.\u201d\n\nAccording to CNN, Zarif was unable to provide proof that Houthis launched the drones and missiles. \u201cI cannot have any confidence that they did it because we just heard their statement,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that we didn\u2019t do it. I know that the Houthis made a statement that they did it.\u201d\n\nZarif continued: \u201cIf they [the US] lift the sanctions that they re-imposed illegally then that\u2019s a different situation, then we would consider [talks].\u201d\n\nPompeo, speaking to reporters accompanying him on his trip to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, insisted: \u201cThis was an Iranian attack. It\u2019s not the case that you can subcontract out the devastation of 5% of the world\u2019s global energy supply and think that you can absolve yourself from responsibility.\n\n\u201cWere it the case that the Houthis\u2019 fraudulent claim was accurate, were that true \u2013 it\u2019s not, but were that true \u2013 it doesn\u2019t change the fingerprints of the ayatollah as having put at risk the global energy supply.\u201d\n\nPompeo met the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, in Jeddah to discuss an international response to Saturday\u2019s attack. Saudi Arabia is looking for an international coalition to challenge Iran, and is reluctant to act alone, or only in concert with its key Gulf allies.\n\nThe US is also discussing how to improve its Patriot missile defence system, which failed to prevent the mix of cruise and drone missiles reaching its target.\n\nIn remarks to the press on his way home, Pompeo remarked of his trip to the Middle East: \u201cI was here in an act of diplomacy. While the foreign minister of Iran is threatening all-out war and to fight to the last American, we\u2019re here to build out a coalition aimed at achieving peace and a peaceful resolution to this.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump, no longer dependent on Gulf oil imports and averse to Middle East wars, has been non-committal on whether he would order US military retaliation. So far he has focused on increasing the already onerous financial sanctions on Tehran over the attack. He has claimed there is plenty of time to undertake \u201cdastardly acts\u201d against Iran.\n\nThe chief diplomatic option would be for the main European powers to put the Iran nuclear deal into review, a precursor to pulling out. The US controversially pulled out of the deal last year.\n\nThe US is also considering to provide visas for Zarif and the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, to attend the UN General Assembly in New York.\n\nPompeo left Jeddah on Thursday heading to the UAE to meet Abu Dhabi\u2019s crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan. The UAE is a close ally of Saudi Arabia, but has started to withdraw its troops from the war in Yemen against the Houthis.\n\nThe UAE announced on Thursday that it had joined the US-led coalition to protect waterways across the Middle East after the attack on Saudi oil installations.\n\nSaudi Arabia joined the coalition on Wednesday; Australia, Bahrain and the UK also are taking part. But Iraq, with close political and religious ties to Iran, announced it would not join because it was a matter for Gulf states.", "description": "Foreign minister\u2019s comments further inflame tensions in Persian Gulf after oil attacks", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87379705c4a4d99bb4e70c3666a325de54ccbfd4/0_0_3022_1814/master/3022.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1f2a44c16f2782b1550e27075863e705", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
