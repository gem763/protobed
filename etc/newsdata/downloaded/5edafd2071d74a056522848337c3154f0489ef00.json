Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) bursting into flames to reveal a pile of skulls.\n\n\u201cThis is the face of socialism and ignorance,\u201d the narrator intones. \u201cDoes Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez know the horror of socialism?\u201d\n\nThe jarring ad, which aired on ABC during Thursday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Houston, compares the freshman Democrat\u2019s support of democratic socialism to the communist Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia that oversaw a genocide that killed an estimated 1.7 million people in the 1970s.\n\n[Democrats argue over health care and other core issues \u2014 and the direction of the party]\n\nThe spot, funded by a newly formed Republican PAC and narrated by a recently defeated California GOP candidate, left Ocasio-Cortez accusing its producers of racism and some questioning why ABC approved the ad. (The network didn\u2019t immediately respond to messages on Thursday night.)\n\n\u201cKnow that this wasn\u2019t an ad for young conservatives of color \u2014 that was the pretense,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. \u201cWhat you just watched was a love letter to the GOP\u2019s white supremacist case.\u201d\n\nThe ad was produced by New Faces GOP, a PAC that aims to bring \u201ccandidate from all races, ethnicities, gender, or geography\u201d to the Republican Party. The Fresno-based organization is fronted by Elizabeth Heng, who lost in November to Rep. Jim Costa (D-Calif.) in a 16th Congressional District race by a 54 percent to 46 percent margin.\n\nHeng narrates the ad by highlighting her family\u2019s story. Her parents, Chieu Heng and Siv Khoeu, survived the Cambodian Civil War, during which the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot slaughtered up to one in every five Cambodians. Her parents eventually made their way to Fresno, where they have operated a market for 25 years, the Fresno Bee reported.\n\n[Fact Checker: What is socialism? What does socialism even mean anymore?]\n\nIn the ad that aired on Thursday, Heng draws a direct line from her parent\u2019s traumatic story to the policies supported by Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n\u201cMy father was minutes away from death in Cambodia,\u201d Heng says. \u201cThat\u2019s socialism. Forced obedience, starvation.\u201d\n\nHeng also suggests her story shows the room for diversity in a GOP increasingly defined by President Trump\u2019s white identity politics.\n\n\u201cMine is a face of freedom. My skin is not white, I\u2019m not outrageous, racist, or socialist,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez, though, argued that by marrying her portrait with such violent imagery, the ad actually made the opposite point.\n\nRepublicans are running TV ads setting pictures of me on fire to convince people they aren\u2019t racist.\n\n\n\nLife is weird! \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 13, 2019\n\nHeng quickly responded by taking full credit for the video, rather than national Republican figures.\n\nNot Republicans. Me. Are you really calling me a racist @aoc? I\u2019m calling all Democrats out for supporting an evil ideology. Or are you just in Congress to hang out with celebrities and tweet out ridiculous ideas like the green new deal? https://t.co/w985LYjIZd \u2014 Elizabeth Heng (@ElizabethHeng) September 13, 2019\n\nAs Ocasio-Cortez and other left-wing voices have gained prominence in the Democratic Party, Trump and the GOP have sought to tie their views to everyone from the Nazis to Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s Venezuelan government. As The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker noted in March, these are often \u201cfacile comparisons, ignorant of history.\u201d\n\nHeng, whose PAC has raised about $170,000 to date, is no stranger to confrontational ads. She was criticized during her campaign against Costa for running an ad depicting a look-alike of the Democrat walking the street in high heels, suggesting he was walking in the shoes of House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the Bee reported.", "description": "\"This is the face of socialism and ignorance,\u201d the narrator intones over images of skulls. \u201cDoes Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez know the horror of socialism?\u201d", "authors": ["Tim Elfrink", "Editor Of The Morning Mix", "September At Am", "Tim Elfrink Joined The Washington Post In He'S The Editor Of Morning Mix."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yVPXatdAllWDvj-WFSGk6VA_ldg=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-13-2019/t_125867a9f3df47fd8dad6d6ac0008d6e_name_Screen_Shot_2019_09_13_at_2_12_58_AM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
