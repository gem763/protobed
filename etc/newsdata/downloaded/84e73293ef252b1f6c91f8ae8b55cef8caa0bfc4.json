Sullivan, an American deacon who had suffered a spine condition, and Villalobos, who suffered life-threatening complications when pregnant with her fifth child, attended the canonisation.\n\nSullivan, who had been told he would end up paralysed, described the pain endured as \u201cbeing on a higher level than a woman going through labour\u201d. Newman was beatified in 2010 after Pope Benedict XV approved Sullivan\u2019s recovery.\n\nPope Francis then credited Newman with curing Villalobos, who went on to have two more children.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a joyous day for me to see Newman become a saint,\u201d Villalobos said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been waiting for this since the minute I was created and here it is. Some people lived an entire life hoping for his canonisation and it never came, so it\u2019s a real blessing to see it and be part of it.\u201d\n\nBoth Sullivan and Villalobos, from Chicago, became devoted to Newman after watching a show dedicated to him on EWTN, a Catholic TV channel.\n\n\u201cI was struck by his tenderness, which came across when I read his letters,\u201d added Villalobos. \u201cHe was a colossal genius, an intellectual powerhouse. And he also had a tremendous loving heart.\u201d\n\nNewman was declared a saint by Pope Francis alongside four women \u2013 Brazilian sister Dulce Lopes Pointes; Swiss laywoman Marguerite Bays; Indian sister Mariam Thresia and Italian sister Giuseppine Vannini.\n\nHe was known as a powerful preacher whose sermons could change lives. Some 15,000 people lined the streets for his funeral in Birmingham in 1890.\n\nThe death of Cardinal Newman \u2013 archive, 12 August 1890 Read more\n\nLinda, a lay chaplain from Nottingham who did not wish to give her surname, travelled to Rome with her family. She said: \u201cFor me, Newman was a person who struggled but never gave up. He wanted the laity to have knowledge, not just blindly follow the faith.\u201d\n\nIt was after a trip to Rome in 1833 that Newman felt called to the Oxford Movement, which sought to renew the Church of England by returning it to its Catholic sources. On converting to Catholicism, he instructed bishops to \u201clisten to the laity\u201d.\n\nNewman also helped reform Oxford University and founded University College Dublin.\n\n\u201cNewman represents integrity and the importance of struggling to find wholeness in the self,\u201d said Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster. \u201cHis view on education, for example, was very much against the manipulation of education purely for economic reasons.\u201d", "description": "Prince Charles described Victorian theologian as a \u2018fearless defender of the truth\u2019", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/663d36f3bd33b78c4c44b44ce1813b8d978cc883/0_0_4400_2640/master/4400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=006f0a3515cc006da75370bf0ec58f70", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
