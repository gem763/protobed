U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper arrived in Iraq on Wednesday to discuss plans for the roughly 1,000 American forces ordered to leave northeast Syria by President Trump.\n\nThe defense chief initially said this week that the troops were being relocated across the border to Iraq, from where they would still be able to quickly deploy back into Syria to help quash any resurgence of the ISIS terror group. But Iraqi military officials said Tuesday that no permission had been granted for the U.S. to increase its troop presence in the country for an extended period.\n\nEsper quickly scheduled meetings with his counterparts in Baghdad and said the plan was for the American forces to remain only temporarily in Iraq before eventually coming home to the U.S., but he gave no timeline.\n\nOn Wednesday, Iraqi Defense Minister Najah al-Shammari told The Associated Press after meeting Esper that the U.S. forces coming in from Syria were merely \"transiting\" through Iraq and that all of the redeployed troops would head to Kuwait, Qatar or back to the United States within a month. There was no immediate confirmation from Esper or the U.S. military of those plans.\n\nDeal between Turkey and Russia puts offensive in Syria on hold\n\nThe abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops from northeast Syria ordered by Mr. Trump about two weeks ago cleared the way for a Turkish military incursion to force the Kurdish-led forces out of the region they have dominated for decades. Those Kurds had been America's most vital allies in the fight against ISIS in Syria for almost six years, and they have felt betrayed and abandoned by the withdrawal of the U.S. forces, who had shielded them from Turkish aggression simply by being there.\n\nThe Turkish offensive has left dozens of civilians dead and driven more than 200,000 people from their homes in the region. As CBS News correspondent Holly Williams reports, the U.S. withdrawal has also allowed Russia, Syrian dictator Bashar Assad's main ally, to step into the power vacuum and emerge as the key power broker in the crisis.\n\nOn Wednesday, Williams stood on Syrian soil where, just three weeks ago, the Kurdish-led, U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces were in control. Now it is Turkey in control of the area.\n\nOn Tuesday night, as the U.S. watched from the sidelines, Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin struck a deal for a new ceasefire in the region. Turkey will get a nearly 20-mile-deep \"safe zone\" along its border, clear of the Kurdish militias that Erdogan's government considers terrorists.\n\nExperts say ISIS and Russia could benefit from Syria onslaught\n\nTurkish soldiers will carry out joint patrols with Russian troops in the buffer zone.\n\nWilliams said she had already seen Russian troops moving into areas that were controlled by the Kurdish forces \u2014 all a powerful illustration of how the U.S. has ceded influence in this corner of the Middle East to Russia.\n\nMr. Trump, however, touted the ceasefire in a tweet Wednesday morning as a \"big success,\" and said America's former allies, the Kurds, wee \"safe.\"\n\nBig success on the Turkey/Syria Border. Safe Zone created! Ceasefire has held and combat missions have ended. Kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us. Captured ISIS prisoners secured. I will be making a statement at 11:00 A.M. from the White House. Thank you! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2019\n\nThe Kurdish forces have told CBS News they're still holding around 12,000 accused ISIS fighters and their family members, including 4,500 foreigners, at jails across the region.\n\nMr. Trump said Wednesday that the ISIS prisoners were \"secured,\" but as Williams reported, some of the biggest questions going forward are who will take control of those prisons to prevent mass escapes, and who will prevent ISIS from reforming its army of militants in the region.\n\nPresident Trump was to speak about the Syria conflict at the White House later Wednesday.", "description": "And it still wasn't clear where the roughly 1,000 American forces being pulled out of the country will go, but it seems they can only stay in Iraq for a month", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/23/b1f09491-5ebf-4ed5-85b8-9e3313d9761a/thumbnail/1200x630/cc3a1c7f0f9c66fdf849bb5284630a4c/russia-syria-troops.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
