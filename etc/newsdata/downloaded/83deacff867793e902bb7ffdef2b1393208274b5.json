From that we reconstruct a three-dimensional volume of the object... to actually read the text in a non-destructive manner,\u201d Chapon said.\n\nThe ink on the scrolls is difficult to see, even through a synchrotron, because it is carbon-based like the papyrus it is written on. But scientists hope the density of the paper will be different where written characters are present.\n\nBy scanning the fragments where characters are visible, they hope to create a machine-learning algorithm that will decipher what is written on the scrolls.\n\nThe data generated by the process will be analyzed by scientists at Kentucky University in the United States using advanced computing techniques to decipher the scrolls\u2019 contents.\n\n\u201cThe library at Herculaneum was the only library that survived from antiquity and because of that the material inside is extremely valuable,\u201d said Brent Seales, professor of computer science at Kentucky University.\n\n\u201cTexts from the ancient world are rare and precious, and they simply cannot be revealed through any other known process.\u201d", "description": "Scientists at Britain's national synchrotron facility have harnessed powerful light beams to virtually unwrap and decipher fragile scrolls dating back some 2,000 years in a process they hope will provide new insights into the ancient world.", "authors": ["George Sargent", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436476630&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9202X"}
