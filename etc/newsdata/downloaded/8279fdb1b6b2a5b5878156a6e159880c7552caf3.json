And in very short bursts.\n\nHer new venture Quibi, short for \u201cquick bites,\u201d is scheduled to launch in April with shows and films from A-list directors such as Steven Spielberg and Guillermo del Toro sliced into increments shorter than 10 minutes that are meant to be viewed on smartphones.\n\nThe short-form streaming service founded by Whitman, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard Co., and Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg has already booked $100 million in advertising revenue. Whitman, speaking at the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Tech Live conference in Southern California, said the ads were bought by Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL, -0.25% GOOG, -0.27% Google, Walmart Inc. WMT, -0.13% , Anheuser-Busch InBev SA BUD, -1.65% , Procter & Gamble Co. PG, +2.60% , PepsiCo Inc. PEP, +0.40% and a handful of others.\n\nThe full programming slate hasn\u2019t been announced, but the service also will include daily news programming. There are two pricing options: An ad-free service that costs $7.99 a month and a $4.99-a-month option with ads.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bringing the best of Silicon Valley and Hollywood together to create a different entertainment platform,\u201d Whitman told MarketWatch in a one-on-one interview. \u201cWe\u2019re not a studio, but commissioning studios to make content.\u201d\n\nIn a separate interview last year, Katzenberg compared Quibi\u2019s master plan to HBO \u2014 a place for quality content that breaks all programming barriers. \u201cThey blew the walls off of length of content, episodes, standards and practices,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to do the same online. It\u2019s narrative storytelling in bite-sized episodes.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s about the only thing small about Quibi, whose iconic founders are wagering a lot of money \u2014 and perhaps their reputations \u2014 on the Hollywood-based startup.\n\nKatzenberg has secured $1 billion in backing from major Hollywood players such as Walt Disney Co. DIS, +1.64% and AT&T\u2019s T, -0.16% Warner Bros.. The venture also is attracting investment from Sony Pictures SNE, -0.35% , as well as Alibaba BABA, -2.09% .\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the biggest idea that we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d says Katzenberg, who co-founded DreamWorks Animation in 1994 with Spielberg and music giant David Geffen.\n\nQuibi\u2019s play to go small comes as media titans Netflix Inc. NFLX, -4.09% , Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.23% , AT&T Inc., Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.12% , Comcast Corp.\u2019s CMCSA, -0.67% NBCUniversal, and Disney slug it out in the video-streaming market with grander (and more expensive) content, spending billions of dollars in the process.\n\nAt the same time, the digital landscape is littered with short-form content from the likes of Alphabet\u2019s YouTube, Facebook Inc.\u2019s FB, -3.91% Instagram, and Snap Inc.\u2019s SNAP, -3.98% Snapchat that is largely free.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean content from Quibi will come cheap. Its \u201cLighthouses\u201d premium videos will cost roughly $100,000 per minute to produce, which puts it on par with some of the most expensive shows on TV.", "description": "Quibi, short for \u201cquick bites,\u201d is scheduled to launch in April with shows and films from A-list directors such as Steven Spielberg and Guillermo del Toro...", "authors": ["Jon Swartz", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT811_Whitma_ZG_20191022164925.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
