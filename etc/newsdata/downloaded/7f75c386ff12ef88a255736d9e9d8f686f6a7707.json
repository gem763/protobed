Our negotiators on the front line in China\u2019s trade war against the U.S. need it. And our farmers and our champion industries need it.\n\nEx-Im, as it\u2019s commonly known, is the export credit agency of the U.S. government, facilitating the export of U.S. goods and services by providing American businesses with the financing necessary to compete for global sales.\n\nUnlike most government undertakings, Ex-Im actually turns a profit, returning billions to the Treasury as exporters repay their loans.\n\nBefore Trump, ideologues on both the left and the right found reasons to eliminate this obscure but necessary agency.\n\nLeft-wing zealots called Ex-Im \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d (never mind that no welfare program has ever returned money to the Treasury), making it the only welfare program Democrats ever opposed. Libertarian fundamentalists funded by the op-en borders Koch network called it \u201ccrony capitalism.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump, no one has any excuse to support unilateral disarmament while Red China deploys massive resources to take over world markets.\n\nThe United States and China are in a contest for global economic supremacy. The National Security Strategy of the United States explicitly identifies China\u2019s economic challenge is a threat to our national security as well our opulence. 21st Century warfare is about economics.\n\nTo achieve its goal, the Chinese communist government is the world\u2019s largest provider of export subsidies, and it is using them to outmaneuver the U.S. in Latin America, Africa, Asia and even Europe.\n\nIn 2009, it handed out over $174 billion in export subsidies to help its national champions win lucrative contracts. This \u201cfree money\u201d allowed Chinese companies to beat out American companies in the competition to build dams, ports and other infrastructure projects around the world.\n\nDue in no small part to Beijing\u2019s rich export subsidies, seven of the top 10 global construction contractors are Chinese. Chinese contractors are now involved in over half of the hydropower projects in the world. Bye bye, Bechtel \u2014 Beijing just underbid you.\n\nChina uses export subsidies that take the form of low-interest financing to lock down natural resources in Africa and Latin America. China is expected to invest $1 trillion in Africa alone over the next decade.\n\nExport subsidies enable the Chinese espionage-cum-telecom company Huawei to offer zero-interest financing on 5G internet infrastructure. Once China controls 5G information infrastructure, it controls everything.\n\nThe global economy is the battlefield in China\u2019s bid for global dominance, and we must engage them with every resource at our disposal.\n\nPresident Trump understands the crucial role of the Export-Import Bank in defending America\u2019s national interest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very good thing and it actually makes money,\u201d President Trump told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cI was very much opposed to Ex-Im Bank, because I said what do we need that for IBM and for General Electric and all these \u2014 it turns out that, first of all lots of small companies will really be helped, the vendor companies, but also maybe more importantly, other countries give it. And when other countries give it, we lose a tremendous amount of business.\u201d\n\nIn addition to China, some 85 other countries have export credit agencies to help their national champions win contracts \u2013 and jobs.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer \u2013 the point man in holding the line against communist China\u2019s economic aggression \u2013 says the lack of a functioning Export-Import Bank \u201cis having an impact and it is way beyond China and is costing us jobs and there is no excuse for it.\u201d\n\nPeter Navarro, the director of the White House office of trade and manufacturing and the architect of the administration\u2019s tough trade policy put it bluntly: \u201cThe costs of keeping the Ex-Im Bank on the sidelines can be measured in the tens of billions of dollars of products we fail to export\u2014and in the thousands of jobs we fail to create when this country does not have a fully functioning export credit agency to compete with its counterparts around the world.\u201d\n\nCongress needs to unite behind American farmers, ranchers, manufacturers and workers and reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n\nAnything less amounts to unilateral disarmament in the face of China\u2019s economic aggression.\n\nCurtis Ellis is Policy Director with America First Policies.
