He was waving his arms about and denying it.\n\n\"We were both shaking, it was so scary. I just wanted them off and to be safe.\"\n\nAlthough the ride has an over the shoulder restraint, the seatbelt is designed to keep the bar in place when the ride is moving.\n\nMrs McCollin said her son Josh had told her he realised his belt was not fastened when he saw it spin between his legs, but he was unable to reach for it because the ride had already started.\n\nThe mum said she is speaking out to warn other parents, and she has also emailed the Health and Safety Executive to report the incident.\n\nShe also believed the concerns of her and her husband were not taken seriously by the staff operating the ride after she reported it to the cashier.\n\n\"She asked which guy it was and then yelled to him to be more careful, she said 'what are you doing?'\n\n\"You need to take more care' but they all looked blankly at her. It's disgracefully shocking.\n\n\"Kev said 'we're wasting our time speaking to them' so we just left, it was just a joke. It was horrifying.\"\n\nThe mum said her children were left terrified afterwards.\n\n\"We left the fair after an hour feeling sick and all in shock and the children petrified. We just didn't want to be there. It's disgraceful.\n\n\"They clearly got them on and off as quickly as possible and forgot, it was only their two belts which had not been fastened.\"\n\nIt comes after a 21-year-old woman was flung from the Airmax 360 ride, also on Monday night.\n\nThe woman was seen hurtling through the air after the bar on her carriage \"failed\" just minutes into the ride starting, falling about 15ft and hitting a teenage boy as she crashed into the neighbouring Sizzler ride.\n\nThe HSE is investigating the incident which happened at around 7.30pm.\n\nGarry Leach, who is chairman of the Showmen's Guild said it is difficult to comment on what happened with Jessica and Joshua, because he has not been made aware of the incident.\n\nHe said: \"We have had no reports what so ever of anything like that so I can't comment on something that I know nothing about.\"", "description": "Liz McCollin said daughter Jessica, 13, and son Joshua, 12, were not properly secured on Monday night, the same evening a woman was flung from another ride", "authors": ["Joanna Lovell"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20547819.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liz-McCollin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
