They said they represented some half-million people who have received mental health services over the years via a charity, the U.S.-based Carter Center.\n\nSuch private aid is not enough to assure that every Liberian receives assistance, they said.\n\n\u201cMental health care continues to be seriously sidelined,\u201d said Bill Ballah, a spokesman for the group. \u201cEach of us needs good mental health to \u2026 pursue our life goals and meet our responsibilities as responsible citizens.\u201d\n\nCritics say Liberia\u2019s president is not interested in creating a war crimes court because his political support base includes some elements who committed atrocities. Weah has rejected that accusation and his supporters dismiss it as untrue.\n\nIn addition to those suffering from trauma caused by the civil wars from 1989 to 2003, thousands of Liberians are trying to recover from the world\u2019s deadliest Ebola outbreak that killed more than 4,000 people in the country from 2014-2016.\n\nMore than 20% of Liberia\u2019s post-war population has mental health issues including post-traumatic stress disorder, the World Health Organization said in 2016.\n\nBut the country has just a couple of psychiatrists for a population of nearly 5 million.\n\nUntil the arrival of a Nigerian psychiatrist three years ago, Dr. Benjamin Harris had been the only psychiatrist in Liberia for decades.\n\nAbout 70% of students Harris interviewed near the end of the civil wars said they had seen people killed or tortured. About 60% said they had lost confidence in human beings and society.\n\n\u201cThis can have a severe consequence on one\u2019s mental function,\u201d he told The Associated Press.\n\nThe need for mental health care in Liberia is so great and complicated that no government has been able to tackle the issue, and none has taken the initiative, Harris said.\n\nGovernment authorities acknowledge the mental health problem is enormous but blame the country\u2019s inability to raise enough revenue to address such issues.\n\nThe chairman of the senate committee on health and a former health minister, Dr. Peter Coleman, said the funding allotted to the health sector in the annual budget is negligible because there are competing priorities.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to mental health right now, it\u2019s collaborations with agencies such as the Carter Center that is helping us to at least do the rudimentary things in mental health,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. David Henderson, chairman of the psychiatry department at Boston University\u2019s medical school, said mental health could be tackled more rigorously in places like Liberia if global health funding paid more attention to psychiatry. If those resources were provided, \u201cwe can really build capacity very quickly.\u201d\n\nHe cited the success story of Ethiopia, which went from just three psychiatrists to about 100 over 15 years.\n\nFor now Liberia has just one overcrowded and underfunded mental health hospital, an annex of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Medical Center in the capital, Monrovia. Patients are charged the equivalent of $10 for 21 days of treatment, a cost many cannot afford.\n\nMeanwhile the Catherine Mills Rehabilitation Center, a facility set up in pre-war Liberia as a home for people with mental illness, was ransacked and looted during the civil war and has never reopened. Officials have tried in vain to persuade people now living amid its ruins to leave.\n\n___\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "More than a decade after back-to-back civil wars ravaged Liberia its people still await justice for countless abuses, and many say the lack of accountability is worsening a mental health crisis.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jonathan Paye-Layleh"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/liberia_mental_health_75683_c95-0-5217-2988_s1200x700.jpg?c607c59f538eec5b210743365cf6a223bac5719b", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
