Jerry did not receive the veterans\u2019 benefits he was owed before he died, Mr Rankin said \u2013 and he blamed Mr McConnell in part for that family tragedy.\n\n\u201cElijah Cummings reached across party lines trying to help my brother get his military benefits, and Mitch McConnell was one of the persons he reached out to,\u201d Mr Rankin said.\n\nMr McConnell did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Mr Rankin\u2019s claims.\n\nMr Rankin said his brother was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a cancer that causes malignant cells to accumulate in bone marrow, more than a decade ago, after leaving the Marines.\n\nMultiple myeloma is one of 15 health conditions linked to Camp Lejeune\u2019s tainted drinking water, which contained industrial solvents, benzene and other chemicals for roughly 30 years beginning in the 1950s, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Veterans who were exposed to the water and later developed any of the conditions can qualify for benefits, including free health care and disability compensation, VA said.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Senate minority leader Charles Schumer, who was standing next to Mr McConnell, appeared to smirk at the Kentucky Republican after witnessing the failed handshake.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Rankin did not even see the video until a Washington Post reporter called.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what people are saying,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Rankin\u2019s relationship with Mr Cummings began with a chance meeting at a gas station in Baltimore more than two decades ago. The pair struck up a conversation while pumping gas and by the time their tanks were full, a friendship was born.\n\nThey stayed close as Mr Cummings ascended in politics, garnering national attention for \u201chis principled stands on politically charged issues in the House, his calming effect on anti-police riots in Baltimore, and his forceful opposition to the presidency of Donald Trump,\u201d as The Post\u2019s Jenna Portnoy wrote.\n\nIn the months before his death on 17 October, Mr Cummings and Mr Trump engaged in public spats that included the president calling the congressman\u2019s Baltimore district a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\u201d. Cummings, in his position as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, also helped lead the Democrats\u2019 ongoing impeachment inquiry against Mr Trump.\n\nMr Cummings was buried on Friday following a funeral in Baltimore attended by thousands, including former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. As politicians and Mr Cummings\u2019 family members remembered the congressman, Mr Rankin had a private parting message for his friend.\n\n\u201cWhen I carry him to his grave, if I could say something to him, I would say something I said to him many, many times before,\u201d Mr Rankin told The Post. \u201cWhat a mighty, mighty man he is.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell cocked his right arm, ready to deliver a handshake.
