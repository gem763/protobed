That's why we test.'\n\nThe visit came as Bridenstine and Musk have been engaged in a public spat over the much-delayed building of the Crew Dragon spacecraft.\n\nMusk said he hoped to have the capsule delivered to NASA by the end of the year.\n\nSome of the technical challenges SpaceX is working on include concerns about the parachutes and the propulsion system.\n\nSpaceX technicians work on the next Crew Dragon Demo-2 craft in SpaceX headquarters, Hawthorne, California\n\nEmployees of SpaceX work on the Crew Dragon reusable spacecraft\n\n'It's a pretty arduous engineering job to get the parachutes right,' Musk said.\n\n'Parachutes, they look easy but they are definitely not easy,' he added. 'We want to get at least something on the order of 10 successful tests in a row before launching astronauts.'\n\nElon Musk CEO of Spacex speaks to the media\n\nSince retiring its space shuttle program, NASA has had to rely on Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the space station at a cost of $85million (\u00a368m) a seat.\n\nIt is now counting on SpaceX and Boeing to carry out that task.\n\nSpaceX was founded in 2002 by Musk to help reduce space transportation costs \u2013 and with an ultimate goal of helping colonize Mars.\n\nThe first manned flight to the space station was due to take place last year but SpaceX suffered a major setback in April when its Crew Dragon spacecraft exploded during testing, prompting delays and renewed tests.\n\n'You know, honestly, if there's a test program and nothing happens in that test program, I would say that test program is insufficiently rigorous,' Musk said on Thursday. 'Space is hard.'\n\nNASA astronauts Bob Benkoe, right, with Doug Hurley talk to the media in front of the Crew Dragon spacecraft\n\nIn a tweet on Wednesday, Musk said that the both the Crew Dragon capsule and the Falcon 9 rocket that is designed to propel it into space are on pace to finish testing in the next 10 weeks.\n\n'For what it\u2019s worth, the SpaceX schedule, which I\u2019ve just reviewed in depth, shows Falcon & Dragon at the Cape & all testing done in ~10 weeks,' he wrote in a tweet.\n\nWhile the prediction was an exciting one, it's worth noting that Musk is known to over-inflate timelines \u2013 famously he claimed his company Tesla would develop fully autonomous cars by 2017.", "description": "The mission being run by both NASA and California-based SpaceX will be the first time US astronauts have travelled to space on a US rocket since the Space Shuttle program ended in 2011.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/10/19581048-0-image-a-3_1570786558333.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
