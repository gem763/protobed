No, not just live captions for video, but rather for any audio that might pass through your phone\u2019s speakers.\n\nWe now know that feature will be available at launch with the Pixel 4, and will arrive on the Pixel 3, 3 XL, and 3a later this year.\n\nI was able to try out the feature early, and it\u2019s quite impressive. This is doubly true considering all the processing happens on the device. Google isn\u2019t sending data to the cloud to improve accuracy, meaning the feature won\u2019t use any of your data and will work if you\u2019re completely off the grid.\n\nThe captions can be activated in two moves. Simply press one of the phone\u2019s volume buttons, and then tap the button that shows up under the volume slider. The captions will begin immediately with almost no delay relative to the audio. The quality of the captions will, of course, depend on the quality of the audio, and Google acknowledges that the AI isn\u2019t quite good enough to understand all speech (say, that of a babbling toddler).\n\nStill, the feature has obvious uses if you\u2019re someone with a hearing disability; it opens up a world of video content outside of YouTube (which already has live captions) without having to use specialized software. But for everyone else, it can come in handy if you want to watch a video but can\u2019t use or hear the audio for whatever reason \u2013 such as if you\u2019re at work or at a restaurant.\n\nIt\u2019s not just for Pixels either; Google says it\u2019s working with other manufacturers to bring the feature to their devices. We\u2019ll see exactly how well the feature works as we spend more time with the Pixel 4. Stay tuned for our review soon.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FSnag_38f6a15.png&signature=84f8471afc80c72e3326fd6e7fe394dd", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
