REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi\n\nThe 350-page book, \u201cLast Judgment,\u201d is by Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi, and is his latest on Vatican finances.\n\nNuzzi writes that years of deficits may leave the Vatican little choice but to declare default by 2023.\n\n\u201cThere is no threat of default here. There is only the need for a spending review. And that is what we are doing,\u201d said Archbishop Nunzio Galantino.\n\nGalantino is head of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See (APSA), a general accounting office that manages real estate holdings in Rome and elsewhere in Italy, pays salaries of Vatican employees and acts as a purchasing office and human resources department.\n\nThe archbishop told the Italian Catholic newspaper Avvenire that while there was \u201cno need for alarmism,\u201d the Vatican had to contain costs.\n\nThe world\u2019s smallest state has no taxes. Its sources of income are from investments, real estate, collections taken around the world from faithful, contributions from dioceses and revenue from its highly popular museums.\n\nNuzzi said contributions from the faithful had fallen sharply in recent years, particularly in countries such as the United States hit by the sexual abuse scandal.\n\nWhile Galantino challenged Nuzzi, saying parts of the book \u201csound a lot like the \u2018Da Vinci Code,\u2019\u201d the Vatican is no stranger to financial scandals.\n\nOn Oct. 2, Vatican police raided two key departments, the Financial Information Authority (AIF) and the Secretariat of State, seizing documents and computers in an investigation into the purchase of a building in a posh neighbourhood of London for $200 million.\n\nFive Vatican employees were immediately suspended and later the head of Vatican security resigned over the leak of a document related to the investigation.\n\nThe Vatican\u2019s prosecutor is looking into possible crimes such as embezzlement, abuse of office, fraud and money laundering, according to people familiar with the search warrant.\n\nThe Vatican bank, known as the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR), was embroiled in several past scandals.\n\nOnly recently has it enacted sweeping reforms, such as closing accounts held by outsiders who had no right to hold them.\n\nAt a news conference presenting the book, Nuzzi said he was a great admirer of Pope Francis and wanted to highlight alleged mismanagement blocking him from enacting long-lasting reform.", "description": "The Vatican on Tuesday dismissed allegations in a new book that the Holy See risks default in the next few years because of falling donations, financial mismanagement and corruption.", "authors": ["Philip Pullella", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443844353&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L1TB", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
