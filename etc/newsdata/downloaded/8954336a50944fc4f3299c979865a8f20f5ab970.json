If you\u2019re looking for a tablet, it\u2019s very likely that the iPad is the right tablet for you. The iPad\u2019s drop in price to $329 earlier this year strengthened its position even further.\n\nBut back when the iPad cost $500 or more, there was a burgeoning market of cheap tablets that promised to do all of the iPad things for a lot less money. This was Amazon\u2019s world. Its line of Fire HD tablets were way less expensive than Apple\u2019s devices, and made for good alternatives if you didn\u2019t want to spend the money for an iPad.\n\nAmazon never really left the cheap tablet market; you\u2019ve been able to consistently get 7- and 8-inch Fire models for as little as $50 that worked fine as a device for kids or a Kindle replacement that could also play video. But now Amazon has refreshed its larger Fire HD 10 for the first time since 2015, with an upgraded display, faster processor, better sound, and lower price. A lot has changed since the last time the Fire HD 10 was updated \u2014 not least of which: the iPad is a lot cheaper now. So, Amazon is tackling that head-on. The HD 10 is much closer in size to the standard iPad, and at $149 to start ($80 less than the 2015 model), it\u2019s less than half the price. (The $149 Fire HD 10 comes with Amazon\u2019s ads on the lock screen; a one-time $15 fee will remove them.)\n\nSo the obvious question, as always, is: does the Fire HD 10 work well enough to be a compelling alternative to Apple\u2019s tablet, while saving you a good chunk of money? I\u2019ve been testing the new tablet for the past few days, and my response is no. If you want an iPad to do iPad things (video, games, reading, email, etc.) and maybe sit in for a laptop from time to time, you should pony up for an iPad. But that doesn\u2019t make the Fire HD 10 a complete write-off.\n\nThe biggest and best improvement Amazon made to the new Fire HD 10 was giving it a new 10.1-inch display with 1920 x 1200 pixels of resolution. It\u2019s well saturated and has good viewing angles, making it great for watching video, browsing webpages, or reading ebooks. It\u2019s obviously not as nice as the iPad\u2019s higher-resolution screen, but most people won\u2019t have an issue with this panel. It\u2019s the best screen an Amazon tablet has had since 2013\u2019s Fire HDX, and far better than I expect from a $150 device.\n\nAmazon\u2019s also upgraded the sound with two Dolby Atmos-tuned speakers, and the processor has been bumped up to a newer MediaTek quad-core chip paired with 2GB of RAM, which Amazon claims is 30 percent faster than the 2015 Fire HD 10\u2019s chip. The entry-level model comes with 32GB of storage, but you can pay more for 64GB or just use a microSD card to expand the storage.\n\nThe Fire HD 10 is very capable of doing basic tablet things: watching video, playing games, browsing the web\n\nAll of these things make the Fire HD 10 very capable at doing basic tablet things: playing video, browsing the web, or even playing games. Navigating the interface, loading apps, and switching between them all happens without drama.\n\nYou don\u2019t really get the feeling that the Fire HD 10 is cheap until you turn it over, where a hardy, matte plastic finish greets you. It feels a bit like a child\u2019s toy compared to an iPad (especially in the bright blue color of my review unit), but it\u2019s grippy and feels like the kind of thing that will take a few knocks without showing it. Most people are probably going to put the HD 10 in a case and never see the finish anyway. (Amazon offers a basic $39.99 folio case that can prop the tablet up in either portrait or landscape orientation.)\n\nDespite its low cost, it\u2019s not the hardware that really holds the Fire HD 10 back from competing head-to-head with the iPad, it\u2019s the software. As with every Fire tablet, the HD 10 runs Amazon\u2019s custom version of Android called Fire OS. The core interface is fine; it\u2019s easy to switch between the main app launcher and sections for video, books, games, music, audiobooks, and magazines. There\u2019s also a new \u201cFor You\u201d section that shows apps, books, and videos you\u2019ve recently used, as well as suggestions for what to do next.\n\nProductivity is where the Fire 10 HD falters\n\nBut going beyond the basics is where the Fire HD 10 starts to falter. Amazon\u2019s app store is loaded with popular apps, such as Netflix, HBO Go and HBO Now, Hulu, and so on, but it doesn\u2019t have nearly as many apps as Apple\u2019s App Store or even Google\u2019s Play Store. It\u2019s missing all of Google\u2019s apps, including Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail, and Chrome, and all of Microsoft\u2019s apps. Fire OS comes with its own web browser and a rudimentary email, calendar, contacts, and document apps, but they are poor substitutes for Google or Microsoft\u2019s suites. This all makes the Fire HD 10 a fine consumption device, but not something you\u2019d want to use for heavy productivity. The app I missed the most was my password manager, which meant that I had to look up my passwords on my phone whenever I wanted to log into an account on the Fire HD 10.\n\nLike most Amazon products, the Fire HD 10 wants you to use Amazon\u2019s apps for everything, such as Kindle, Amazon Music, Audible, Prime Photos, and so on. All of these apps come preinstalled on the tablet and are great if you\u2019re already fully invested in them. But if you use a different photos app or music player on your phone, they won\u2019t do you much good here.\n\nOne thing that Amazon has added is hands-free Alexa, which means you can bark voice commands at the Fire HD 10 and it will respond to you, even if the screen is off. Like the Echo Show, the Fire HD 10\u2019s version of Alexa will display information on the screen depending on what you ask. Ask for the weather and it will show current conditions plus a five-day forecast, for example. Alexa on the Fire HD 10 is almost as fully capable as it is on Echo devices, and it can be used for managing smart home gadgets, adding things to a shopping list, or buying items from Amazon by voice. The only thing it wouldn\u2019t do for me is play music from Spotify or use Alexa voice and video calling, which is an odd and frustrating limitation, given that Echo devices support Spotify and the Fire HD 10 has a front-facing camera. (Amazon tells me that it is \u201cworking on\u201d support for Spotify.)\n\nThat makes the Fire HD 10 a compelling kitchen tablet: it can be used hands free for unit conversions, timers, alarms, recipe look-ups, and other cooking related tasks. Or you can use it to watch videos from Netflix, HBO, Amazon Prime, or other sources, including live TV from Hulu or Sling. That makes it a better (and cheaper) kitchen device than Amazon\u2019s own Echo Show, provided you don\u2019t care about using Amazon\u2019s video calling service (and you probably don\u2019t).\n\nThe other thing that the Fire HD 10 will be appealing for is as a device for kids. I\u2019ve already mentioned its hardy construction, but it also supports multiple accounts and parental controls, which are non-existent or difficult to implement on an iPad. Since kids are most likely to use a tablet for watching video or playing games, the Fire HD 10\u2019s software limitations aren\u2019t going to be much of an issue here. (The only problem might be YouTube, which can be accessed via the Fire HD 10\u2019s web browser.)\n\nI don\u2019t think cheap tablets will ever be as interesting as they were a few years ago, when the iPad was a much more expensive device. But while the Fire HD 10 won\u2019t win over anyone looking to replace their laptop with a tablet, it\u2019s still a fine tablet for doing basic things that doesn\u2019t cost a fortune.\n\nAnd when you\u2019re spending $150, there\u2019s little more you can ask.", "description": "The PlasticPad", "authors": ["Dan Seifert", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N8uob3uBlgivwESTh-e_w61OyeM=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9424749/dseifert_171008_2043_4334.jpg", "published_at": "2017-10-11"}
