It\u2019s cool. Luke Toki didn\u2019t win Australian Survivor. I\u2019m fine with it. I am fine with it.\n\nLuke, the King of the Jungle, was quite emotionally voted out in fourth place in last night\u2019s opening half of the Survivor finale, leaving Harry, Baden, and Pia left to duke it out in the Final Three. Luke failed to win immunity, and the other three banded together to, rightly, vote him out of the game. He was easily the biggest game threat to each of them, none of them would\u2019ve been able to beat him at a Final Tribal Council, it was the smartest thing to do for all of their individual games. I get it. It\u2019s cool. I\u2019m not happy about it, but I am f-i-n-e with it.\n\nOrdinarily that would\u2019ve been the end of it, but unfortunately for me my fairly prodigious ass wrote a sizeable cheque in its own name last week in the form of this article:\n\nIt\u2026 kinda blew up. A lot.\n\nThat rather bold headline did more than your average amount of rounds. So much so that it wound up coming across the bow of Luke himself, who reposted it on Instagram which is, as far as my world as concerned, praise from Caesar.\n\nEven still, I might have been happy enough to just leave it all at that; to let it wither away into the ether; to leave the Channel Ten doorstep unsullied.\n\nBut then Luke got eliminated last night, and Channel Ten started getting cocky about it.\n\nShortly after the episode aired, the official Channel Ten Twitter account \u2013 not the Australian Survivor one, who knows better than this \u2013 decided to try and call my bluff out in the open.\n\nRighto then! Good bloody morning to YOU.\n\nThere you go, ya jerks. Don\u2019t wake the snake.\n\nNow to address the flushing question in the room: Is that blurred-out but suspiciously bar-shaped brown blob actually a turd and not, say, a Cadbury Boost bar that I purchased at the nearby Woolworths mere minutes before? Legally, I\u2019m not at liberty to say.\n\nBut know this: If you think for a second that I\u2019m above getting my ass out of bed 45 minutes before my usual alarm just so I can go down to South Yarra and stage a human turd photo in order to make sure a rival network\u2019s social media team is only half right when they call me out, you\u2019ve got another damn thing coming.", "description": "Last night Channel Ten tried to call us out for promising to shit on their doorstep if Luke lost Survivor.
