Kimberly had dreamed of life in New York City since she was eight years old. Growing up in a middle-class family just outside Philadelphia, she was regaled with stories about her mother\u2019s short, glamorous-sounding stint waitressing in Times Square. Kimberly\u2019s version of the big-city fantasy was also shaped by reruns of \u201cFelicity,\u201d a late-nineties drama set at a lightly fictionalized version of N.Y.U. Her dream school did not disappoint. Kimberly was an intrepid, committed student, studying the effects of globalization on urban space; she worked with street venders and saw their struggles to make ends meet. College opened up a new world to her. But her family had sacrificed to help finance her education, and she had taken out considerable loans. She had looked forward to putting her degree to good use, while chipping away at the debt behind it. But the job she was offered involved outsourcing labor to foreign contractors\u2014exacerbating the inequalities she hoped a future career might help rectify. Zaloom felt that there was something representative about Kimberly\u2019s story, as more students find themselves struggling with the consequences of college debt. She wanted to learn about the trajectory that had brought Kimberly to her office that day. She visited her at home and listened as her mother, June, talked about how she, too, had fantasized about a life in New York. But June\u2019s family had needed her back home, in Pennsylvania, where she met Kimberly\u2019s father. They eventually divorced, but they stayed in the same town, raising Kimberly together. June had wanted her daughter to have the experiences she had missed out on. When Kimberly was accepted at N.Y.U., her father urged her to attend a more affordable school in state. June implored him to change his mind, and he eventually agreed. The decision stretched their finances, but June told her daughter, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go.\u201d It\u2019s easy to dismiss quandaries like Kimberly\u2019s as the stuff of youth, when every question seems freighted with filmic significance. There\u2019s a luxury to putting off practical concerns. But her story gave Zaloom insight into the evolving role of college debt in contemporary American life. Kimberly\u2019s predicament was put in motion when she first set her sights on attending a college where, today, the annual tuition is more than fifty thousand dollars, in one of the most expensive cities in the world. That her parents risked their financial stability to nurture this dream seemed meaningful. Previous generations might have pushed a college-bound child to fend for herself; Kimberly\u2019s parents prized notions of \u201cpotential\u201d and \u201cpromise.\u201d Shielding her from the consequences of debt was an expression of love, and of their own forward-looking class identity. Since 2012, Zaloom has spent a lot of time with families like Kimberly\u2019s. They all fall into America\u2019s middle class\u2014an amorphous category, defined more by sensibility or aspirational identity than by a strict income threshold. (Households with an annual income of anywhere from forty thousand dollars to a quarter of a million dollars view themselves as middle class.) In \u201cIndebted: How Families Make College Work at Any Cost\u201d (Princeton), Zaloom considers how the challenge of paying for college has become one of the organizing forces of middle-class family life. She and her team conducted interviews with a hundred and sixty families across the country, all of whom make too much to qualify for Pell Grants (reserved for households that earn below fifty thousand dollars) but too little to pay for tuition outright. These families are committed to providing their children with an \u201copen future,\u201d in which passions can be pursued. They have done all the things you\u2019re supposed to, like investing and saving, and not racking up too much debt. Some parents are almost neurotically responsible, passing down a sense of penny-pinching thrift as though it were an heirloom; others prize idealism, encouraging their children to follow their dreams. What actually unites them, from a military family in Florida to a dual-Ph.D. household in Michigan, is that the children are part of a generation where debt\u2014the financial and psychological state of being indebted\u2014will shadow them for much of their adult lives. A great deal has changed since Kimberly\u2019s parents attended college. From the late nineteen-eighties to the present, college tuition has increased at a rate four times that of inflation, and eight times that of household income. It has been estimated that forty-five million people in the United States hold educational debt totalling roughly $1.5 trillion\u2014more than what Americans owe on their credit cards and auto loans combined. Some fear that the student-debt \u201cbubble\u201d will be the next to burst. Wide-scale student-debt forgiveness no longer seems radical. Meanwhile, skeptics question the very purpose of college and its degree system. Maybe what pundits dismiss as the impulsive rage of young college students is actually an expression of powerlessness, as they anticipate a future defined by indebtedness. Middle-class families might not seem like the most sympathetic characters when we\u2019re discussing the college-finance conundrum. Poor students, working-class students, and students of color face more pronounced disadvantages, from the difficulty of navigating financial-aid applications and loan packages to the lack of a safety net. But part of Zaloom\u2019s fascination with middle-class families is the larger cultural assumption that they ought to be able to afford higher education. A study conducted in the late nineteen-eighties by Elizabeth Warren, Teresa Sullivan, and Jay Westbrook illuminated the precarity of middle-class life. They found that the Americans filing for bankruptcy rarely lacked education or spent recklessly. Rather, they were often college-educated couples who were unable to recover from random crises along the way, like emergency medical bills. These days, paying for college poses another potential for crisis. The families in \u201cIndebted\u201d are thoughtful and restrained, like the generically respectable characters conjured during a Presidential debate. Zaloom follows them as they contemplate savings plans, apply for financial aid, and then strategize about how to cover the difference. Parents and children alike talk about how educational debt hangs over their futures, impinging on both daily choices and long-term ambitions. In the eighties, more than half of American twentysomethings were financially independent. In the past decade, nearly seventy per cent of young adults in their twenties have received money from their parents. The risk is collective, and the consequences are shared across generations. At times, \u201cIndebted\u201d reads like an ethnography of a dwindling way of life, an elegy for families who still abide by the fantasy that thrift and hard work will be enough to secure the American Dream.\n\nIf you are a so-called responsible parent, you might begin stashing away money for college as soon as your child is born. You may want to take advantage of a 529 education-savings plan, a government-administered investment tool that provides tax relief to people who set money aside for a child\u2019s educational expenses. Some states even provide a 529 option to prepay college tuition at today\u2019s rates. Zaloom writes of Patricia, a schoolteacher in Florida who managed to cover in-state fees for both of her children after five years of working and saving. Patricia resented the fact that preparing for her children\u2019s future left her with so little time and energy to be with them in the present. Her daughter, Maya, was academically gifted and excelled in college. Then, when Patricia\u2019s son, Zachary, was a high-school senior, her husband walked out on the family, leaving them four hundred thousand dollars in debt. Patricia spent her retirement savings to keep them afloat. Zachary had difficulty coping, and he had never shown a strong inclination toward college, but the money was already earmarked. Zaloom writes, \u201cHer investment in his tuition was an expression of faith in him.\u201d He struggled in college and never graduated. \u201cIf I\u2019d had a crystal ball,\u201d Patricia says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have gotten in the program for Zachary.\u201d In Zaloom\u2019s view, Patricia\u2019s decisions all point to a core faith that college is fundamental to middle-class identity. Throughout \u201cIndebted,\u201d parents and children lament the feeling of burdening one another. Parents fear that their financial decisions might limit their children\u2019s potential, even when those children are still in diapers. It\u2019s a fear, Zaloom argues, that loan companies often exploit. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t not hear about it,\u201d Patricia recalled of the commercials for Florida\u2019s college-savings account. The existence of 529 plans suggests that paying for college is just a matter of saving a bit of each monthly paycheck. And yet Patricia is an outlier. Only three per cent of Americans invest in a 529 account or the equivalent, and they have family assets that are, on average, twenty-five times those of the median household. Zaloom disputes the premise that \u201cplanning leads to financial stability.\u201d Student debt didn\u2019t become a problem because families refused to save. \u201cIn truth, it\u2019s the other way around,\u201d she writes. \u201cPlanning requires stability in a family\u2019s fortunes, a stability in both family life and their finances that is uncommon for middle-class families today.\u201d As an anthropologist, Zaloom is particularly attuned to how institutions teach us to see ourselves. The Free Application for Student Aid (FAFSA) form, required of all students seeking assistance, consists of a hundred or so questions detailing the financial history of the applicant\u2019s family. Zaloom hears about the difficulty of collecting this information, especially when parents are estranged, or unwilling to help. And the form presumes a lot about how the \u201cfamily unit\u201d works. One informational graphic poses the question \u201cWho\u2019s my parent when I fill out the FAFSA?\u201d Our failure to adhere to these official scripts becomes a sign of personal inadequacy. Zaloom argues that the financial-aid process encourages families to \u201cmaintain silence about the challenges they face in sending their children to college.\u201d Sometimes, during her interviews, parents would ask Zaloom not to disclose the details of their finances to their children. (Elizabeth Warren has spoken about how she learned that her family was \u201cpoor\u201d when she was filling out her financial-aid forms.) At times, the families sounded as though they were in denial. One mother wanted to shield her daughter from reckoning with the family\u2019s tenuous financial health as they put her through college: \u201cIt\u2019s not really part of a conversation that [my daughter] needs to be in.\u201d That conversation can\u2019t always be avoided, though. As Kimberly\u2019s parents hashed out her prospects, there was, she recalled, \u201cthis weird moment of them feeling like my potential was going to be limited by their financial decisions and choices.\u201d\n\nA few generations ago, going to college didn\u2019t involve so many forms, and seldom led to existential questions about the nature of familial ties. If you were a white male of means, it wasn\u2019t all that difficult to attend the college of your choice. If you were not, then college probably wasn\u2019t in your future. In the early years of the twentieth century, college graduates were rare: only about two to three per cent of adults earned a degree. Things changed with the G.I. Bill, which was designed to pre\u00ebmpt the veterans\u2019-rights marches that came after the First World War. The college population grew by nearly half a million, and campuses quickly expanded their facilities and faculties to keep pace. Still more Americans were able to go to college in the sixties, thanks to the National Defense Education Act of 1958, which offered financial assistance to students pursuing studies that could benefit the national interest, and the Higher Education Act of 1965, which provided federal support to poor and working-class students, regardless of what they wanted to study. Female enrollment levels soared, too. But the specific ways in which the federal government helped make college affordable changed\u2014from tuition subsidies and grants to an increasingly complicated network of federal and private loans. Starting in the sixties, Americans became more comfortable with the idea of taking on personal debt, owing in part to the rise of personal credit. Besides, for a long time, a college degree was a sound investment. Paying for it was just a transitional nuisance on the way to middle-class adulthood. In 1972, President Nixon created Sallie Mae, a partnership between the government and private lenders designed to help students. There was broad federal support to deliver more students to college. When Ronald Reagan took office, in 1981, some people feared that his faith in free markets would mean the end of federal assistance programs and research support. But colleges continued to expand, partly as a result of growing applicant pools. New loan programs targeted middle-class families. The advent of the U.S. News & World Report college rankings, in 1983, and the rise of the test-prep industry helped create a new culture of competitive credentialism. Tuition had come to increase at nearly twice the rate of inflation. \u201cYou know that if we\u2019re late they\u2019re going to blame me.\u201d Cartoon by Elisabeth McNair In 1979, the sociologist Randall Collins published \u201cThe Credential Society,\u201d which was recently reissued by Columbia. College had, in Collins\u2019s view, become little more than an expensive and inefficient system of accreditation. The problem was that those with power were the ones determining how much credentialling was sufficient, making young people feel that they needed a degree, no matter the cost. Collins\u2019s insights are especially prescient, as the scholar Tressie McMillan Cottom notes in the new edition\u2019s foreword, when considering how for-profit colleges have essentially preyed on the insecurities\u2014and leeched off the loans and subsidies\u2014of poor and working-class students. This \u201ccredential inflation\u201d wasn\u2019t driven by innovation or technical need. It was a product of social pressures. A college degree, once a guarantor of economic mobility, had become what a high-school degree symbolized to previous generations, \u201cthe prerequisite of mere respectability.\u201d\n\nFor Zaloom\u2019s families, the spectre of debt impedes the children\u2019s transition toward self-sufficiency. One of her subjects is Clarice, an N.Y.U. undergraduate who grew up near Buffalo. Clarice\u2019s mother, a social worker, and her stepfather, a retired military man, had to take on substantial debt to cover the thirty-six thousand dollars they owed for her first year, despite her large merit scholarship. For the remaining three years, Clarice took out loans in her own name totalling around sixty thousand dollars. Her mother recalled a conversation they had when deciding on colleges. \u201cYou\u2019re making decisions today, Clarice, that are going to affect your whole life,\u201d she told her daughter. \u201cYou might not be able to buy a home. You might not be able to own a car. You have to make choices.\u201d Clarice\u2019s family was one of the few in the book to look at the college-finance process in such sober terms. Yet they embarked on it anyway. \u201cEnmeshed autonomy\u201d is what Zaloom calls a situation in which parents and children face a future of intertwined finances, even as they hope for future independence. Critics who describe the student-loan industry as predatory or exploitative are often told that the problem is one of individual irresponsibility. But Zaloom\u2019s families illustrate how difficult it is to negotiate the snares set out by lenders and colleges. The system \u201cmonetizes the power of those bonds\u201d between parents and children, she says, promoting the \u201cmorality of fiscal restraint to families even as it banks on their risk taking.\u201d Zaloom offers a range of explanations for rising tuitions, from plush facilities and fancy meal plans to the expansion of administration and student services. Perhaps the reality is that college is expensive because it can be\u2014especially when the destiny of one\u2019s child seems to be at stake. \u201cIndebted\u201d ends up being a story about modern families\u2014about how we understand our responsibilities toward one another in a time of diminishing prospects. Sacrifice is nothing new, and guilt has mediated family relations for eons. But there\u2019s a distinctly modern paradox in Zaloom\u2019s version of middle-class life, with parents preparing their children for adulthood while also protecting them from it. One mother provides her son with spreadsheets every semester that show \u201chow much tuition is per hour, how many credit hours he\u2019s taken, how much his room and board is, how much every book costs.\u201d It seems both infantilizing and like an attempt to accelerate a child\u2019s acceptance of real-world responsibilities. Other parents incur enormous credit-card debt or put off retirement in order to provide their children with luxuries and opportunities that they were never able to enjoy. The stories in \u201cIndebted\u201d end right around the time that the students are entering the complex world of loan repayment. Graduation is fresh in their minds; debt is just an abstraction, and the future can still feel open.", "description": "The cost of a degree\u2014and the \u201copen future\u201d that supposedly comes with it\u2014has become one of the defining forces of middle-class life, Hua Hsu writes.", "authors": ["Hua Hsu", "Mike Mariani", "Dan Piepenbring", "Michael Schulman", "Kristen Roupenian", "Susan B.
