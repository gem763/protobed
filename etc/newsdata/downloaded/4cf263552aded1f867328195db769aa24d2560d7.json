Mitt Romney, who has recently said he may decline to support President Trump\u2019s reelection bid, tweeted on Sunday that it would be \u2018troubling in the extreme\u2019 if the president appealed to his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nIn a tweet on Sunday, Romney said it was \"critical for the facts to come out.\u201d Trump called his conversations with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u201cperfectly fine and routine.\"\n\nBiden has said in the past that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to Hunter Biden\u2019s case, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNunes said the details from the whistleblower complaint still have not been confirmed to Congress. He said the inspector general for the intelligence community met with lawmakers last week, but did not reveal anything.\n\nNunes said the committee is scheduled to meet soon with the acting director of national intelligence, where he hopes more information will be shared. He claimed the story is playing out in a similar way to the Russia collusion accusations.\n\n\"Doesn't it feel like the Russia hoax all over again? It's like the Ukrainian hoax,\" he said.", "description": "House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., questioned Monday the validity of accusations that President Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son.", "authors": ["David Montanaro", "David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/nunes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
