Such compulsion is fundamentally unjust and unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nNational Right To Work Foundation represents the plaintiffs. Their case was struck down by the Illinois 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in March. They filed a petition in July asking the Supreme Court to hear the case.\n\nFoundation President Mark Mix said this is about compelled speech vs. free speech.\n\nMix said what\u2019s happened is there\u2019s \u201ca private institution in between taxpayers and elected officials and [the union] is able to speak for government employees that, heretofore, never asked for, never wanted, and in fact stand back and say, \u2018I don\u2019t want you to speak for me,\u2019 as [plaintiffs] have said in this case,\u201d Mix said.\n\nJanus is a child support specialist with the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services and, because of Illinois law, is forced to pay fees to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a government union, to keep his job.", "description": "Illinois workers whose fight against being forced to pay dues .09/02/2019 3:10:35AM EST.", "authors": ["Watchdog News", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
