So when I was walking up the Canal Saint-Martin in June with a French friend, I was surprised to notice that the heavy metal sets of p\u00e9tanque were being outnumbered by sleeker, wooden pins strewn across the ground. The game\u2019s called M\u00f6lkky, my friend told me, and though it\u2019s originally from Finland, it\u2019s become popular, especially among young Parisians. \u2018On Mondays, my older co-workers joke that I must\u2019ve spent my weekend playing M\u00f6lkky and drinking beer on the Canal, and I just look at them and say, \u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what I did,\u201d\u2019 he said, laughing.\n\nPart of the appeal of M\u00f6lkky over p\u00e9tanque, he explained, is the material of the set itself. Though the crate of pins takes up more physical space than a bag of p\u00e9tanque balls, it\u2019s much lighter to carry around the city, since they\u2019re made of wood and not metal. But the real reason to play this lawn game is \u2014 duh \u2014 because it\u2019s fun, as I quickly learned when I bought my own set from Amazon when I came back to the US \u2014 a cross between bowling, billiards, and blackjack with a mix of strategy, skill, and luck.\n\nYou arrange the 12 numbered pins in a diamond on the ground, like bowling. Then, from about three meters away, you take the throwing skittle (yes, that is the technical term for the round, wooden peg without a number) and toss it underhand, toward the diamond. You earn points depending on the number of pins that hit the ground. When more than one pin falls, your score is the number of fallen pins, but if you just hit one pin, you earn the number on the pin. So to earn five points, either you knock down five pins in one toss, or you take out the one pin with the No. 5 etched on top.\n\nThe scoring itself is blackjack-like in its strictness. The first player to get to 50 points wins, and it has to be exactly 50 points. If you accidentally score more, by knocking down one too many pins or taking out one with a higher point value than you need, then you drop back down to 25. And like billiards, you start the next player\u2019s turn where the last one ended, by standing the numbered pins upright, exactly where they landed. That means every round has a different layout of pins each time you throw.\n\nDespite all these nuances, the game goes by pretty quickly \u2014 each round takes only about 15 minutes \u2014 and the learning curve isn\u2019t too steep for first-time players. However, it\u2019s still slow-paced enough to drink a beer and chat with your friend while you play, which is really the main reason to play any lawn game, whether or not it\u2019s cool in France.\n\nMore Strategist-approved lawn games\n\nGoSports Backyard Bocce Set If you\u2019d like to try your hand at bocce, the Italian version of p\u00e9tanque, this lawn game is one of the most hyperenthusiastically reviewed outdoor games on Amazon. \u00a326 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nColorful Feather Chinese Jianzi Kicking Shuttlecock This Chinese toy is easier to kick around than a hacky sack, but is a solid option for those looking for a game that\u2019s a little more active.
