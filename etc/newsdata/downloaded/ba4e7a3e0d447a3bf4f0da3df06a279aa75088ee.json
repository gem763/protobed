Most importantly, it also means that there's going to be a lot of antics from Gritty, the Philadelphia Flyers' mascot and chaos agent. The unsettlingly large, orange, and googly-eyed creature has been simultaneously charming and terrifying hockey fans (and everyone else) since his 2018 introduction. Now, in honor of Gritty's second year on the team, he's shared a Spotify playlist that is just completely wild and unpredictable.\n\nGritty shared the mix in a tweet captioned, \"Nobody asked, but as always, I delivered. These are the jams I\u2019ll be drop it drop it low girling to all szn long.\" The result isn't post-genre as much as it is complete anarchy. Abrasively titled \"IT SZN 2 Y'ALL,\" it starts with Kanye West's \"Amazing,\" which implies that what's to follow is ostensibly a fairly standard hype playlist. Not so. Five songs later, Enya's \"Only Time\" throws the whole thing for a loop, and two tracks following that is not the classic, expected choice of Smash Mouth's \"All Star,\" but instead the Breathe Carolina remix of Smash Mouth's \"All Star.\" There's a Kenny Loggins, Destiny's Child, and Wang Chung one-two-three punch midway through and artists like Lizzo, Creed, and even that curly-haired kid with the hat from Stranger Things all feature. The mix closes with Spongebob Squarepants' \"Goofy Goober Rock.\" It's a trip.
