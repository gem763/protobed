It is a solid start but there are so many games left.\n\n\"It is very early days to talk about everything but we want to keep pushing and keep winning games.\n\n(Image: PETER POWELL/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n\"Hopefully we can get everybody back after the international break and go again.\"\n\nFaced with a Leicester side that has impressed in the early stages of the season and entered the weekend third in the table, Liverpool took the lead towards the end of the first half when Sadio Mane was played through by Milner and slotted past Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nBut James Maddison cancelled-out the striker's fifth league goal of the season to put Brendan Rodgers' side back on level terms with just 10 remaining.\n\nJust as it looked like Liverpool's flawless start was set to come to an end, the hosts were awarded an injury-time penalty after Marc Albrighton was adjudged to have tripped Mane in the area.\n\nThe decision was confirmed by VAR and Milner, who is out of contract at the season and is believed to be in talks with the Reds over an extension, stepped up to seal all three points.\n\n\"We always knew it would be a tough game,\" the former England international said.\n\n\"They are a strong side but this team keeps going to the end and always finds a way to win.\"\n\nWhen asked about a potential deal, Milner added: \"Hopefully scoring today hasn't done any harm so we will see what happens.\"", "description": "The Reds are top of the Premier League table after a perfect start to the new season", "authors": ["Hassan Rashed", "Image", "Getty Images", "Peter Powell Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20471051.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-FC-vs-Leicester-City-United-Kingdom-05-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
