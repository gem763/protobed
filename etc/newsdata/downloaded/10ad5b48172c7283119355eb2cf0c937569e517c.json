The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2017 alone: \u201cThere were more than twice as many suicides (47,173) in the United States as there were homicides (19,510).\u201d\n\nCDC statistics also reveal that suicide is the second-leading cause of death in America among individuals between the ages of 10 and 34.\n\nAccording to the American College Health Association, suicide doubled among girls 15 to 19 years old and grew by 30% among boys between 2007 and 2015.\n\nWhat\u2019s causing all of the human misery? More homes with guns? The fact is that the percentage of U.S. homes with guns has not increased from where it was decades ago.\n\nOne thing that has changed is the shattering of the American family.\n\nSocial science researcher Pat Fagan of LoveAndFidelity.org has pointed out that 12 of every 100 U.S. babies were born out of wedlock or to a family that would suffer divorce in 1950. Today, for every 100 babies born, more than 60 are born out of wedlock or to a family that will soon fracture.\n\nAs much as we want to deny or wish away the harmful effects of divorce, a broken marriage often results in brokenness in the hearts of children.\n\nWhat else marks modern American culture? A media that spews violence 24/7, a male obsession with shoot-\u2018em-up video games and the proliferation of pornography that treats people like meat.\n\nIn fact, we\u2019ve now raised an entire generation on a steady diet of media that degrades humanity at every turn.\n\nThe deadliest change in American culture? Our failure to worship God.\n\nFewer families attend church, and children have little or no religious upbringing, leaving them ignorant of biblical truth and the support that a faith community provides. Children are no longer taught that God declares that their lives have purpose and meeting.\n\nIn fact, when the way America treats our preborn also changed, we emphatically declared that the value of a human life is relative, based on whether it is \u201cwanted.\u201d\n\nWhen you add all of this together, are we truly surprised at the helplessness, hopelessness and anger that consume our young adults in record numbers?\n\nIs it any mystery why America is in the midst of an opioid crisis? Or that millions of people now suffer from depression and other mental illnesses?\n\nIt\u2019s time for all Americans of good will to commit to transforming our culture. The message that must be sent loud and clear through every American institution is that human life has infinite value and limitless potential. Our children and society are literally dying to hear the words that there is a God that loves them, that made them in his image, that calls them to be his own.\n\nAs Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevins remarked during a recent event: \u201cYou want to take away any kind of morality and change the mores of a nation, remove any sense of higher responsibility. Try to pin it on any one thing and assume the government and a piece of regulation or rule is the solution, and then we\u2019re shocked when these things happen. We\u2019re kidding ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe entirety of his remarks can be viewed on YouTube and is useful for people of all political persuasions who truly want to examine the causes of our current culture of death and seek solutions.\n\nUntil Americans face the realities of how our toxic culture is damaging our young people, they will increasingly live in sadness, abuse their bodies \u2014 or even kill themselves and snuff out the lives of others.\n\nPerhaps President Trump will convene a bipartisan task force to examine the root causes of our societal ills and the possible solutions.\n\nCertainly, churches and organizations should join hands, fall to our knees and seek God\u2019s wisdom for a course of action.\n\n\u2022 Next week: America\u2019s need for spiritual revival.\n\n\u2022 Rebecca Hagelin can be reached at [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
