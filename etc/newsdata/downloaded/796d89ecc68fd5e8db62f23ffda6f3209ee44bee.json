REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji\n\nThe 22-year-old Dutch driver also questioned the stewards\u2019 response, with an initial announcement that they were taking no further action before then deciding to summon both drivers afterwards.\n\n\u201cSuddenly into Turn Two Charles just drove into the side of my car,\u201d Verstappen told Sky Sports television. \u201cFrom my side I don\u2019t think I could have done anything different there.\n\n\u201cThe weird thing is that initially they don\u2019t even investigate it, I mean my whole car is destroyed. The whole side. There were just holes in the side of the car. And then they start to investigate it but now it\u2019s after the race.\n\n\u201cI mean, what more should he (Leclerc) do to get a penalty? I like hard racing, but I don\u2019t think this was hard racing. This was just irresponsible driving into Turn Two.\u201d\n\nVerstappen, who was forced off, eventually retired in the pitlane after 15 laps while Leclerc had to pit for a new front wing.\n\nThe Monegasque had started on the front row, with team mate Sebastian Vettel on pole, but both Ferraris made poor starts with Valtteri Bottas seizing the lead for Mercedes into the first corner.\n\nVerstappen had made a strong start, from the third row, in a home race for Red Bull\u2019s engine partner Honda.\n\nVettel moved slightly before the lights went out and then stopped, escaping punishment because his tyres did not cross the line to trigger a sensor \u2014 a decision Verstappen also questioned.\n\n\u201cJust watching the footage back from Seb\u2019s start \u2014 I mean, he moves, he stops,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe rule says you cannot move, and that\u2019s fine because he didn\u2019t gain an advantage they said. I really don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on today with the rules.\u201d\n\nLeclerc defended himself and said it was a \u2018tricky situation\u2019.\n\n\u201cObviously I understeered being behind Seb and Lewis (Hamilton), and then we touched, I don\u2019t know what happened from the full situation from the outside, and this I need to look at,\u201d he said.", "description": "Max Verstappen accused Ferrari rival Charles Leclerc of irresponsible driving at the Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday after a first lap collision between the two put the Red Bull driver out of the race.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440313915&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C07S", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
