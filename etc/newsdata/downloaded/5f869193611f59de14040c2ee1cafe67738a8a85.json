It shouldn\u2019t be a question \u2013 it should be happening.\n\nBut judging from past spin-offs led by women that basically caused the world to implode \u2013 oh hey, Ghostbusters, didn\u2019t see you there \u2013 it makes me question whether the world is really ready to embrace a female-led spin-off retelling a story already established by a man.\n\nI support these stories being created, but I find a problem in the fact it always seems to be a re-telling of a previously male-fronted plot, rather than something new.\n\nWill Ballerina compare to John Wick? (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nLast week it was confirmed Keanu Reeves was acting as executive producer on a John Wick female-spin off, and I so want it to work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the success of John Wick 3 earning $323 million (\u00a3292 million) worldwide, Lionsgate has decided to move forward on the movie, dubbed Ballerina, that will centre on a female assassin.\n\nFemale assassins are awesome \u2013 may I bring your attention to Charlize Theron in Atomic Blonde \u2013 but off the back of John Wick I can only assume the box office takings will be compared, the action will be scrutinised and the character will be analysed alongside Keanu\u2019s titular lead star.\n\nIt\u2019s not a good start when Ballerina is focusing on an assassin hell-bent on vengeance. Exactly the same trope rolled out for John Wick.\n\nPerhaps the question shouldn\u2019t be \u2018are the fans ready for all-female spin-offs\u2019, it\u2019s \u2018are film companies ready to put their money on the line and take some chances on fresh content that riffs on past stories, instead of re-doing them\u2019.\n\nFresh stories fronted by women will work, not re-doing what has been done (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nYou\u2019ve got to risk it to get the biscuit and by giving women a story but making it the same plot trivialises the whole meaning. It\u2019s like the women are being thrown a bone by getting to take on characters previously helmed by men.\n\nWhy can\u2019t we ditch the \u2018all-female/female-led spinoffs\u2019 and create fresh content, totally separate from what had come before? Without the legacy of the wildly-popular original hanging over it for diehard fans to compare it to.\n\nIf Ballerina does flop, people will say it\u2019s all because it\u2019s got a female lead, as opposed to simply not having Keanu Reeves. In this, Hollywood bosses will be even more reluctant to take chances on fresh female-led content.\n\nPeople just weren\u2019t a fan of this remake (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nFrom past experience, it\u2019s become clear the fanbase of these films and franchises aren\u2019t welcoming of their beloved tales being redone with women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fandom was seething when four women \u2013 Kate McKinnon, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kristen Wiig \u2013 took on the beloved franchise of Ghostbusters in a pretty much identical film with the genders flipped in 2016.\n\nAnd they voted at the box office, with the reboot taking $229million (\u00a3181million), still a tidy figure for any film, but with it prepped to be a mighty Sony blockbuster it was seen as a loss in the eyes of critics.\n\nWhat could have been a really awesome story was sullied by the fact it was clearly trying to capitalise on the success of the OG films, and in turn it didn\u2019t measure up in the eyes of the audience.\n\nOceans 8 worked because it was different (Picture: Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc)\n\nI\u2019m sure there are many who simply didn\u2019t like the fact girls were allowed in the Ghostbusters clubhouse, but to me it was almost a disservice to the females leading these spin-offs when they\u2019re just picking up what the dudes did before.\n\nHad a fresh film, away from the history of the original, been created I hazard a guess the vitriol and venom wouldn\u2019t have been so harsh.\n\nPaint me pessimistic but I fear the audiences aren\u2019t going to respond to their favourite franchises being spun-off so unimaginatively. We need to do better for the fans AND for the stories and women being represented.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this can work \u2013 think Oceans 8. This was no \u2018spin-off\u2019 or \u2018reboot\u2019, it was a fresh sequel that carried on from the original Oceans films that were fronted by males.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it grossed nearly $300million (\u00a3237million), proving powerful women can continue the story started by a guy, and that\u2019s the difference. Keep the story going, move it on, just don\u2019t re-do it because you\u2019re too lazy to think of a brilliant new tale for the women to tell.\n\nBrie Larson has revealed that she and her fellow female MCU stars have pitched the idea of an all-women Marvel film to boss Kevin Feige.\n\nWhen it comes to Marvel, the female characters rising to the top in a potential film is something I feel will rally the troops. It\u2019s not copying past films, it\u2019s creating something new.\n\nCaptain Marvel, Scarlet Witch, Shuri, Valkyrie, Mantis, Gamora, Okoye, Nebula, Hope Van Dyne and Pepper Potts kicking butt? It\u2019ll totally work \u2013 because these characters weren\u2019t created as a trivial attempt at diversity. Same with Black Widow. That spin-off will work because it\u2019s not trying to re-do a past story.\n\nSure you could argue that we\u2019ll only make positive changes if we simply start somewhere, and by me sitting here being all Debbie downer over female spin-offs I\u2019m part of the problem.\n\nAll I want is for producers to not feel they\u2019re doing us a favour by giving us a female-led film that\u2019s all same same but different gender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can totally handle a fresh story.
