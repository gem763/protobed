We will always defend the right of self-determination in Catalonia,\" said Quim Torra.\n\nThe region saw seven consecutive nights of protests after nine Catalan separatist leaders were convicted of sedition for leading a failed 2017 bid for independence.\n\nThings have calmed down a bit but the Committees for the Defence of the Republic (CDR) \u2014 the umbrella group of different organisations \u2014 called for another rally on Tuesday night.\n\nOn a visit to Catalonia on Monday, acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez criticised Torra for failing to restore order.\n\nThe regional leader tried to meet Sanchez while he was in Catalonia but was rebuffed.\n\nOn Monday, hundreds of peaceful protesters waved placards urging Sanchez to \"sit and talk\" with Torra.\n\nBut the government has said talks are impossible with Torra until he condemns the violence unequivocally.\n\nIn his reply, Torra asked \"for dialogue with conditions\" but his response did not mention the violence. Torra had said on Saturday that he had always condemned the violence.\n\nA spokeswoman for the pro-independence party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC), which is allied with Torra's group, condemned Sanchez for not talking directly to the Catalan government.\n\n\"Sanchez is refusing dialogue for the umpteenth time. (This shows) disrespect to the people of Catalonia,\" Marta Vilalta Torres said.\n\nBut the leader of Spain's main opposition centre-right People's Party, Pablo Casado said Sanchez's reaction was not strong enough.", "description": "Madrid was urged on Tuesday to open talks on self-determination for Catalonia after days of at-times violent protests over jail sentences for nine separatist leaders.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/91/96/1000x563_cmsv2_1cdbcc79-f6b3-5268-985f-8fbd2f1ec1de-4249196.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
