Banks will collapse, there will be massive erosion and it will send sediments down the river.\u201d\n\n\u2018Dead things everywhere\u2019: is Australia facing the summer from hell? Read more\n\n\u201cThese sort of ecological collapses are much harder and expensive to reverse,\u201d she warned.\n\nThe New South Wales government announced a $10m rescue package last week to mitigate the effects of the river crisis on native fish this summer.\n\nThe NSW agriculture minister, Adam Marshall, said the unprecedented action would provide \u201ca lifeline for key native species ahead of an expected summer of horror fish kills\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re staring down the barrel of a potential fish Armageddon, which is why we\u2019re wasting little time rolling out this unprecedented action,\u201d Marshall said.\n\n\u201cBy starting this operation today we\u2019re getting on the front foot while we still have the chance to rescue and relocate as many fish as possible.\u201d\n\nLast December and January fish began dying in their hundreds of thousands in the far west of the state at Menindee, leaving weirs and waterholes carpeted with dead fish. While fish deaths have occurred in the past, the scale was unprecedented and stunned Australians.\n\nSeveral scientific reports said the lack of flow in the river due to the drought and exacerbated by irrigation upstream were to blame. When temperatures soared to over 40C and were followed by a cool change, the water in the pools striated, leading to de-oxygenation of the deeper water, killing fish.\n\nBut there are already doubts about how effective the $10m program will be.\n\nThe unprecedented operation aims to move as many fish as possible from 15 to 20 priority waterholes in a two-week period, including Murray cod, some of which are at least 25 years old, golden perch and other rare species.\n\nBoats with electrostatic fishing equipment will be used to stun the fish in weir pools and waterholes along the Darling at Menindee, where they will scooped up and loaded into special climate-controlled transport to a section of the Darling further south, near Wentworth, where the river joins the Murray, which is still flowing.\n\nDepartment of Primary Industries fisheries scientists are targeting fish contained within drying pools that are not expected to last through the summer.\n\n\u201cBy moving these fish, such as Murray cod and golden perch, we\u2019re providing the best possible chance of survival,\u201d Marshall said.\n\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\nBut the government has not said how many fish it will move. One source told the Guardian it was hoped it would be in the hundreds. This is just a fraction of the population of the river and will not prevent the likelihood of further mass fish deaths during the coming summer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a photo-op rather than a real deal,\u201d said a Menindee local, Graeme McCrabb, who has become a spokesman for the local community on the lower Darling.\n\n\u201cThere would be 10,000 cod between Weir 32 [at Menindee] and the Murray,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd silver perch, listed as a vulnerable species, are difficult to catch with electro fishing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Lake Wetherill goes, there will be even more fish die than last year,\u201d McCrabb warned.\n\nA program last summer to install aerators in larger waterholes near Menindee, which aimed to stir the water and restore oxygen, was only marginally successful due to the size of the pools and the vast length of the river.\n\nMeanwhile, the NSW government appears to be in denial about possible causes of the ecological catastrophe last summer. The water minister, Melinda Pavey, has criticised her own independent adviser, the NSW Natural Resources Commission, which said extractions by irrigators upstream may have led to the Lower Darling being pushed into hydrological drought three years earlier than it otherwise would have been.\n\nThe commission has called for an urgent revision of the rules that allow irrigators to continue to extract from the river when flows are very low. It wants the threshold when irrigators must cease to take water from the river to be raised, along with other rule changes.\n\n\u201cThe NRC report was one of a number that has given advice on this issue,\u201d said Sheldon, who contributed to the report.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a contentious issue. We just raised the question: have [the extraction rules] influenced the conditions that have led to the catastrophic drying of the Barwon-Darling?\u201d\n\n'Shooting the messenger': water experts say NSW minister wrong to question drought findings Read more\n\n\u201cIf the answer is that extractions did contribute, then the answer is straightforward: we need to change the rules.\n\n\u201cIf they didn\u2019t, then the answer is a whole lot more complex. We need to understand what is really going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fish rescue program will preserve some genetic diversity, but the government also needs to monitor the surrounding ecosystems, as [returning] fish would not survive if mussels and other invertebrates are lost,\u201d she said.\n\nThe government said the fish would be able to migrate back up the 500km of the Darling when the drought ended.\n\n\u201cWhen flows do return to normal, the fish will be able to migrate to their \u2018homes\u2019 back upstream, without the need for additional intervention,\u201d Marshall said.", "description": "There are doubts the Noah\u2019s Ark plan for the Lower Darling will be enough to prevent more mass fish kills", "authors": ["Anne Davies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b151afdb8005c1fd5dd18c59c2cbdf48dd71a7b/0_0_3885_2331/master/3885.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2486819411a9566b1344ef594b764d8e", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
