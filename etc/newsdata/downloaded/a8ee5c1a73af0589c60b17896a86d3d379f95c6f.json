He has used the forum to generate controversy and lambaste his critics. There is no reason to believe that will stop when he leaves office and every reason to believe that with more time on his hands and fewer constraints, he\u2019ll feel even more freedom to let it rip to his tens of millions of followers. Trump is 73 years old \u2014 his mother lived until 88 and his father until 93. It\u2019s quite possible that he could be tweeting for a very long time\u2026 Just imagine the following scenario: During a future Republican presidential primary battle, Trump fires off a series of controversial tweets on the news of the day. Democrats, and the media, line up to attack Trump for spreading hate. How do Republican candidates respond? Republicans could side with Trump when asked, once again tying themselves to him. Alternatively, they could try to criticize him in an effort to create distance. But doing so would only alienate Trump voters \u2014 a segment of the party who any candidate would likely have to win over or at least mollify to capture a nomination. And the famously thin-skinned Trump would not hesitate to attack any Republican candidate who criticizes him as weak and a loser.\n\nLotta variables here, as Klein acknowledges, starting with the fact that a Trump who serves two terms will obviously command more loyalty among populist Republicans than a Trump who crashes out of office ignominiously next fall. Being seen as a winner is a core part of his appeal; whatever you may think about Mitt Romney and Trump as people, the fact remains that one won and the other lost and parties follow the lead of winners. A two-term Trump will sail into retirement with that perception intact. A one-term Trump won\u2019t, although he\u2019ll do his best to convince fans that he was cheated somehow out of another term that was rightly his.\n\nEither way, even a diminished Trump will retain the loyalty of some share of MAGA Nation in retirement. Granted, maybe not in perpetuity. I can imagine a scenario in which the GOP elects another (Trump-approved) populist president and then the base sides with the new guy on an issue in which Trump is on the other side. For instance, let\u2019s say the party nominates a border-hawk nationalist like Tom Cotton in 2024 and Cotton goes on to win the presidency. Cotton is Trumpy in various ways but conspicuously not on foreign policy \u2014 he\u2019s every inch a hawk a la Lindsey Graham and would certainly be more likely to intervene abroad militarily than Trump would be. President Cotton might well have ordered the bombing of Iran a few months ago that Trump canceled at the last minute. If he hits Iran in 2025 and Trump slams him for it on Twitter, with whom would Trump/Cotton voters side?\n\nMy guess is they\u2019d side with Cotton. Whether the party succeeds or fails depends upon the success of its actual leader, not the leader in exile. Supporting Cotton would be seen as necessary to protect his chances at reelection in 2028. There\u2019d also be a \u201crally \u2019round the flag effect\u201d for a wartime president, as there always is. And MAGA Nation isn\u2019t adamantly anti-interventionist the way they are adamantly anti-illegal-immigration; a strike on Iran wouldn\u2019t be some core betrayal of the populism that got Cotton elected. It\u2019d be a form of Jacksonianism, arguably. Trump himself might think twice about criticizing Cotton for it, fearing that if he did that and the base sided with the sitting president, he\u2019d be humiliated and his influence would never be the same.\n\nBut what if the next Republican president isn\u2019t a populist and thus intrinsically suspicious to MAGA-ites? What if it\u2019s Nikki Haley, someone whom grassroots righties distrust but whom they\u2019d grudgingly support in an election in the name of defeating the Democrats? In that case we might end up with a de facto schism within the GOP in which Haley leads 65 percent of the party while Trump effectively directs the most populist 35 percent. How does that work in practice? Negative partisanship is a powerful force that would ensure most of those disgruntled populists reluctantly turned out for her in her reelection campaign, but we\u2019ve never had a situation in modern political history in which a former president idolized by a significant minority of the base is sitting on the sidelines relentlessly criticizing the party\u2019s new leader.\n\nAnd Trump really might do that. Especially if he was relegated to one term in office and feared being one-upped by a more popular person who followed him. That\u2019s who he is.\n\nYou don\u2019t even need a scenario in which another Republican is successfully elected president to see the problems here. As Klein says, it\u2019s unimaginable that Trump would stand by and let the 2024 primaries play out without him not only being a key player but *the* key player. Watching \u201chis\u201d voters shift their attention from him to the party\u2019s next crop of candidates would be poisonous to his ego. He\u2019ll certainly try to insert himself into the race. How do you handle that if you\u2019re Mike Pence or Haley? I think it\u2019s possible for an establishmentarian to win the nomination over the objection of the populist base, but what happens if Trump agitates against the nominee for having betrayed his legacy in their policy program or whatever? Would that be enough to sink the nominee? Would the nominee thus be forced to follow Trump\u2019s program instead?\n\nExit question: What if Don Jr runs in 2024? If you think it\u2019s a problem to have Trumps meddling in the future of the GOP after you-know-who has left office, imagine the extent of the problem if there are still Trumps on the primary ballot.", "description": "Rule by tweet.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/t-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
