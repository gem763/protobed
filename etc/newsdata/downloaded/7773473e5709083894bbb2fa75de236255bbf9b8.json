Over the summer, California and New York passed statewide laws. In the months since, a handful of local jurisdictions, including Montgomery County and Cincinnati have introduced their own bills.\n\nAD\n\nSince New York City updated its guidelines, the city has investigated five additional cases of discrimination relating to hair, and concluded an existing case with a $70,000 penalty, McCauley said.\n\nAt the public hearing Tuesday, residents described pressure from employers, schools and other institutions to adapt their hair so it abides by \u201cEurocentric standards of beauty.\u201d Montgomery resident Soffie Ceesay described it as a \u201cnot-so-explicit, but felt\u201d form of discrimination.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy hope is that this will bring awareness,\u201d Peterkin-Bishop said in an interview. \u201cWomen of color have been conditioned that straight looks better, more professional. Some people prefer that, but at the very least, we need to have the option [to go natural.] At the least, we need to have the choice to go in with our \u2018fro.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHoward Hoffman, an employee rights lawyer based in Rockville who has represented both employers and workers, said he thinks the proposed bill will have the largest impact on business owners, particularly those in the county\u2019s growing service industry, where there may be preexisting appearance guidelines for employees.\n\n\u201cThis will be one more thing that employers need to keep in mind when it comes to their compliance checklist,\u201d he said, adding that he suspects some businesses will see the legislation as unnecessary government interference.\n\nAD\n\nFor Peterkin-Bishop, the notion that some employers will view potential new standards as arduous is further evidence of a problem in the county.\n\nAD", "description": "The bill would allow residents who face discrimination based on their hair to seek a civil penalty of up to $5,000", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DTRcqmSEC4tlxMm_jU4hQge_agM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZBPR2GHPQEI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
