Warren\u2019s campaign trails him only narrowly, with a $24.6 million quarterly haul.\n\nThe staggering fundraising figures reflect the sway that progressives hold in the Democratic primary contest and their determination to nominate one of their own after President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump campaign slams Minneapolis mayor, Target Center for 'attempting to extort' them with rally security fees Susan Rice calls Trump decision to pull troops from Syria 'batshit crazy' Ex-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report MORE\u2019s victory over a more moderate Democrat, Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPoll: Trump gains among independents against Biden, Warren Hillary Clinton calls Trump's Syria pullout a 'sickening betrayal' of allies Where are questions of economic and political inequality in the Democratic debates? MORE, in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe lost in 2016 partly because the Democratic establishment and Democratic establishment money nominated a losing candidate,\u201d said Jonathan Tasini, a national surrogate for Sanders\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cNow, jump forward several years, all those voters understand you can\u2019t nominate the same kind of candidate. But to have an alternative, you have to put your money where your mouth is.\u201d\n\nWhether small-dollar contributions are enough on their own to fund a campaign capable of going head to head with Trump\u2019s cash-flush operation in 2020 remains an open question. The president, together with the Republican National Committee, raised $125 million in the past three months alone.\n\nIn a nod to that reality, Warren has already signaled that she may not stick to her ban on high-dollar fundraisers if she wins the Democratic nomination, asserting in an interview on MSNBC earlier this year that Democrats should not pursue a policy of \u201cunilateral disarmament\u201d when it comes to raising money for the general election.\n\n\u201cWe gotta go into these fights and we gotta be willing to win these fights,\u201d she said at the time.\n\nSanders, on the other hand, appears poised to stick to his grassroots fundraising pledge. Faiz Shakir, his campaign manager, said last week that Sanders was \u201cthe only candidate 100 percent funded by grassroots donations \u2013 both in the primary and in the general.\u201d\n\nBut Rufus Gifford, the finance director for former President Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign, said that the eventual nominee will likely have to turn to big-ticket events and joint fundraisers with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) if they hope to compete in the general election.\n\n\u201cWhoever is the presumptive nominee, at that point, will start raising money with the DNC, which means that the ticket prices for events get much higher and the audience that you\u2019re going to get much larger,\u201d Gifford said. \u201cI don\u2019t see how you close the door to high-dollar fundraising in the general.\u201d\n\nFor now, Sanders\u2019s and Warren\u2019s third-quarter hauls more than a year out from Election Day are, for the most part, on par with those of past Democratic presidential hopefuls.\n\nDuring the same period in 2007, then-Sen. Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaTrump's former ISIS envoy slams Syria decision: 'Donald Trump is not a Commander-in-Chief' Where are questions of economic and political inequality in the Democratic debates? Rep. Joe Kennedy has history on his side in Senate bid MORE (D-Ill.), raised $20.6 million. And in the third quarter of 2015, as Clinton pursued the Democratic nomination, she reported raising $29.4 million, federal campaign finance filings show.\n\nObama, in particular, touted strong support from small-dollar donors. But what sets Warren and Sanders apart is their avoidance of big-ticket fundraisers altogether.\n\nOne benefit to leaning on small donors is that they can continue to give month after month, unlike those who contribute the maximum amount of $2,800 per election at once, leaving candidates with a steadier stream of cash flowing into their campaigns. Sanders\u2019s campaign boasted last week that 99.9 percent of its donors have not yet hit the contribution limit and can donate again.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about $10 or $20 donations. We\u2019re not talking about maxing out,\u201d said Charles Chamberlain, chairman of the progressive political action committee Democracy for America. \u201cIt\u2019s something that people do repeatedly throughout the year, many, many, many times.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe small-dollar strategy stands in contrast with that of former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenA dozen House Democrats call on EU ambassador to resign amid Ukraine scandal Ex-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Buttigieg unveils aggressive plan to lower drug prices | Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks | Trump takes heat from right over vaping crackdown MORE and other top-tier candidates, who have been less reluctant to attend high-dollar fundraisers. In the third quarter alone, Biden held more than 40 fundraisers and donor events.\n\nAnd while his campaign has touted strong grassroots support, Biden\u2019s average donation size was $44, his campaign said, notably higher than that of Sanders and Warren. He ultimately finished the quarter with a $15.2 million fundraising total, down from about $22 million in the second quarter of the year.\n\nTwo other top-tier fundraisers who have courted traditional donors, Sen.

Harris pulled in $11.6 million over the past three months, down from $11.8 million in the second quarter, while Buttigieg raised $19.1 million, after topping the field with $24.8 million in the previous quarter.\n\nBiden\u2019s allies downplayed concerns about his fundraising numbers, arguing that he had been off the campaign trail for years before launching his presidential bid and has not had the time to build out a network of small donors to the same degree as Warren or Sanders.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is, Biden has not developed to the extent that Bernie Sanders has a network of online contributors who are willing to send him $10 a month,\u201d said Dick Harpootlian, a prominent Biden supporter and donor in South Carolina. \u201cHe\u2019s only been doing it for six months. Bernie\u2019s been doing it for years.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Harpootlian said, many traditional donors who have sat on the sidelines while the primary plays out are poised to weigh in soon, especially as Biden faces increasingly aggressive attacks from Trump, who is now facing an impeachment inquiry for his efforts to pressure foreign governments to investigate Biden and his family.\n\n\u201cMore people who haven\u2019t weighed in are weighing in now, because of Trump focusing so heavily on Biden,\u201d Harpootlian said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a hell of a quarter this next quarter.\u201d", "description": "Sens.
