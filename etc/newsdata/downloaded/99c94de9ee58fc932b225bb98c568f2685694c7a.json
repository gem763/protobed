Oil prices fall as supply risk premium fades, demand outlook drags\n\nBy Roslan Khasawneh\n\nSINGAPORE, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday,\n\nerasing more of the gains realised after the Sept. 14 attacks on\n\nSaudi Arabian oil facilities, as the rapid return of production\n\ncapacity from the world's top exporter squashed risk premiums.\n\nPrices were also pressured by worries of weak global\n\neconomic growth and its effect on oil demand.\n\nBrent crude futures fell 32 cents, or 0.5%, from the\n\nprevious session's close to $62.42 a barrel by 0131 GMT.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell\n\n8 cents, or 0.1%, to $56.33 a barrel.\n\n\"For most of the week ... the market has been trading lower\n\nas oil bulls have been discouraged by the quicker-than-expected\n\nreturn of Saudi oil output,\" said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific\n\nmarket strategist at AxiTrader.\n\nWTI futures were down 3% so far for the week, marking the\n\nlargest weekly loss in 10 weeks, while Brent was down 2.9% on\n\nthe week, its largest weekly loss in seven.\n\nSaudi Arabia had brought its production capacity back to\n\n11.3 million barrels per day (bpd) less than two weeks after the\n\nattacks on it oil facilities, sources briefed on the matter told\n\nReuters this week.\n\nThe attacks, which knocked out 5.7 million bpd of\n\nproduction, initially sent oil prices up 20% although they\n\ndropped soon after as the kingdom pledged to bring back output\n\nby the end of September.\n\nA surprise 2.4 million-barrel build in U.S. crude\n\ninventories last week also weighed on prices. EIA/S\n\nU.S. inventories may rise further over the near term,\n\nfurther pressuring prices, as American refiners curb runs for\n\nmaintenance, analysts said.\n\n\"The expected lower demand for oil inputs into (U.S.)\n\nrefineries typically sees U.S. crude inventories swell, all of\n\nwhich could pose a significant downside risk for prompt oil\n\nprices,\" Innes said.", "description": "Oil prices fall as supply risk premium fades, demand outlook drags", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE2J0AZ-ORUBS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
