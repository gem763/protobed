He broke off the talks on Saturday after the Taliban claimed responsibility for an attack in Kabul last week that killed an American soldier and 11 others.\n\nZabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, criticized Trump for calling off the dialogue and said U.S. forces have been pounding Afghanistan with attacks at the same time.\n\n\u201cThis will lead to more losses to the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cIts credibility will be affected, its anti-peace stance will be exposed to the world, losses to lives and assets will increase.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Afghan peace talks were on hold and Washington would not reduce U.S. military support for Afghan troops until it was convinced the Taliban could follow through on significant commitments.\n\nThe United States has recalled U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad to chart the path forward, Pompeo said in appearances on Sunday TV news shows. Asked on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d whether Afghan talks were dead, Pompeo said, \u201cFor the time being they are.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage Elections in Afghanistan becoming more necessary by the hour, says EU special envoy\n\nTrump has long wanted to end U.S. involvement in Afghanistan - since his days as a candidate - and American diplomats have been talking with Taliban representatives for months about a plan to withdraw thousands of U.S. troops in exchange for security guarantees by the Taliban.\n\nU.S. and Taliban negotiators struck a draft peace deal last week that could have led to a drawdown of troops from America\u2019s longest war. There are currently 14,000 U.S. forces as well as thousands of other NATO troops in the country, 18 years after its invasion by a U.S.-led coalition following the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on the United States.\n\nFighting in Afghanistan has continued amid the talks and recent assaults by the Taliban cast doubts over the draft deal. As violence has escalated, Afghan leaders including President Ashraf Ghani have been increasingly critical of the deal and encouraged the Taliban to enter direct talks.\n\nAsked whether the collapse of talks put a U.S. troop pullout on hold as well, Pompeo said the issue would be discussed. \u201cThe president hasn\u2019t yet made a decision on that,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nCAMP DAVID SURPRISE\n\nTrump decided to get personally involved to get the agreement to the finish line at Camp David after \u201creal progress\u201d had been made in talks, Pompeo said.\n\nForeign troops with NATO-led Resolute Support Mission investigate at the site of a suicide attack in Kabul, Afghanistan September 5, 2019.

I want to talk to these Taliban negotiators. I want to look them in the eye. I want to see if we can get to the final outcome we needed.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe U.S. president has touted his skills as a negotiator and personal rapport with world leaders including Kim Jong Un of North Korea, but such one-on-one diplomacy has not led to any breakthrough deals so far.\n\nTrump was criticized, even by some fellow Republicans, for having offered to host on U.S. soil a militant group that has killed American troops and had sheltered al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.\n\n\u201cCamp David is where America\u2019s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11,\u201d U.S. Representative Liz Cheney, a Republican whose father, Dick Cheney, was U.S. vice president at the time of the attacks, wrote on Twitter on Sunday. \u201cNo member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever.\u201d\n\nAmericans will on Wednesday mark the 18th anniversary of the al Qaeda attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.\n\nTaliban fighters, who now control more territory than at any time since 2001, launched assaults over the past week that included a suicide attack in Kabul on Thursday that killed U.S. Army Sergeant Elis Barreto Ortiz, 34, from Puerto Rico.\n\nEarlier this month, senior security officials in Kabul said joint air raids by U.S. and Afghan forces against the Taliban have not subsided. Pompeo said more than 1,000 Taliban fighters have been killed in Afghanistan in the last 10 days.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nNine former U.S. ambassadors warned on Tuesday that Afghanistan could collapse in a \u201ctotal civil war\u201d if Trump withdraws all U.S. forces before the Kabul government and the Taliban conclude a peace settlement.\n\nPompeo downplayed chances of a premature withdrawal.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump made clear we\u2019re not just going to withdraw because there\u2019s a timeline. We\u2019re only going to reduce our forces when certain conditions are met,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump's decision to cancel Afghan peace talks will cost more American lives, the Taliban said on Sunday while the United States promised to keep up military pressure on the militants, in a stunning reversal of efforts to forge a deal ending nearly 20 years of war in Afghanistan.", "authors": ["Abdul Qadir Sediqi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427745118&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8711X", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
