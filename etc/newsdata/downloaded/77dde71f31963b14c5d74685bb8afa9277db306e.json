And, most notably, the United States agreed to back off on new and withdraw previously instituted sanctions on Turkey.\n\n\u201cThe Turkish side will pause Operation Peace Spring in order to allow for the withdrawal of YPG [Kurdish] forces from the safe zone for 120 hours,\u201d Pence said at the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence in Ankara, referring to the name the Turkish government has used to describe its incursion. \u201cAll military operations under Operation Peace Spring will be paused and Operation Peace Spring will be halted entirely on completion of the withdrawal. Our administration has already been in contact with Syrian defense forces and we've already begun to facilitate their safe withdrawal from the nearly 20-mile-wide safe zone area south of the Turkish border in Syria.\u201d\n\nThe agreement came after more than four hours of talks between Erdo\u011fan, Pence, Pompeo and other high-ranking U.S. officials. Ninety minutes of the negotiations were between Pence and Erdo\u011fan alone.\n\nFrom the outset, the mission had long odds: Pence and Pompeo landed in the Turkish capital on Thursday to the news that Erdo\u011fan had tossed a letter from Trump in the trash. Walking out of the ambassador's residence here en route to the presidential palace to meet with Erdo\u011fan, they wore stern looks and declined to take questions.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement represents a modest foreign policy victory for the United States as it tries to halt an invasion that has killed civilians, driven America\u2019s former Kurdish allies into the arms of Syrian strongman Bashar Assad and caused the release of hundreds of ISIS prisoners.\n\nAnd it represents a political respite for Trump, who had come under fierce criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike for seeming to abandon a vulnerable population the U.S. had sworn to protect.\n\nPence said the U.S. and Turkey had agreed to \"coordinate efforts on detention facilities and internally displaced persons in formerly ISIS-controlled areas. The two countries also agreed \"on the priority of respecting vulnerable human life, human rights and particularly the protection of religious and ethnic communities in the region,\" he said.\n\nPompeo\u2019s trip will also take him to Jerusalem for consultations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and to Brussels for a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.\n\nIt comes as the secretary grows more deeply enmeshed in Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe, with State Department staffers defying his orders to share their accounts of how the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani led a shadow foreign policy with Ukraine that cut out professional diplomats.", "description": "US agrees to back off sanctions for 120-day truce.", "authors": ["Jake Sherman", "Zia Weise"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176353523-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
