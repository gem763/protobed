Two people were also wounded by bullets and underwent surgery.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The gunman was filmed wearing a helmet and shooting in a street in Halle\n\nReports say the gunman also tried to set off explosives at the synagogue.\n\nWitnesses say he was heavily armed, and an online anti-Semitic \"manifesto\" attributed to him shows guns, apparently home-made.\n\nSurvivors say they hid behind the synagogue's heavy locked doors until police arrived, which took more than 10 minutes.\n\nHow big a threat is anti-Semitism in modern Germany?\n\nAuthorities have noted a recent rise of anti-Semitic incidents in Germany, a country that is still haunted by the murder of six million Jews under Nazi rule.\n\n\"We unfortunately have to face the truth, which - for some time already - is that the threat of anti-Semitism, right-wing extremism, and right-wing terrorism is very high,\" Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told reporters on Thursday.\n\nGerman police provide varying degrees of protection to synagogues. But when this is not possible, local Jewish communities sometimes work with law enforcement to provide for their own security.\n\nSince the shooting, police presence has been increased outside synagogues in several east German cities, including Leipzig and Dresden, according to local media.\n\nOliver Malchow, chairman of the German police union (GdP), said police were too thinly spread for 24-hour protection of places of worship.\n\n\"While we're tackling terrorism we cannot at the same time involve many staff in monitoring far-right extremists,\" he told German broadcaster ZDF. \"We didn't underestimate it, but we can't foresee everything and prevent it.\"\n\nThe attack was condemned by European leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel. At an event in Nuremberg, Ms Merkel said the government would use \"all means available\" to tackle hatred and bigotry.\n\nElsewhere, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the shooting as a \"terror attack\" and warned anti-Semitism was on the rise in Europe.", "description": "Authorities say the suspect was planning a massacre at the synagogue in Halle.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07qmkvf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
