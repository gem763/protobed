(Reuters) - California firefighters on Friday sought to take advantage of a brief lull in high winds behind fast-moving wildfires that forced the evacuation of more than 40,000 residents north of Los Angeles and another 2,000 in the state\u2019s wine country.\n\nFirefighters battle a fire, as a wind driven wildfire continues to burn in Canyon Country north of Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 25, 2019. REUTERS/Gene Blevins\n\nWith winds abating, crews worked overnight to battle a newly-started fire about 40 miles (64 km) north of Los Angeles that was threatening 10,000 homes and businesses, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said.\n\nOfficials warned residents not to be deceived by the overnight lull, as the National Weather Service forecast a pickup in hot, dry winds by Friday morning with gusts of 45 to 55 mph (72 to 89 kph) and temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius).\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not let our guard down,\u201d said Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger. She told a press conference 40,000 to 50,000 residents had been forced from homes by late Thursday with \u201cnumerous\u201d structures destroyed.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s wildfires generally erupt in the fall as hot, dry Santa Ana winds blow westward from the desert after a dry summer. Last year, at least 85 people died in one of the deadliest such fires, known as the Camp Fire in Butte County.\n\nThe so-called Tick Fire, which began Thursday afternoon just outside the city of Santa Clarita, had consumed about 4,000 acres and was only 5 percent contained as of late Thursday, the county fire department said.\n\nAnother burst of high winds was expected over the weekend, said Marc Chenard, a meteorologist with the NWS\u2019s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.\n\nTo the north, where firefighters were battling a smattering of blazes, crews had restored power to most of the nearly 200,000 homes and businesses intentionally left in the dark because of risk of high winds downing electrical lines.\n\nDAMAGED ELECTRICITY TOWER\n\nPower had been shut off to residents from the Sierra Foothills to the North Bay and San Mateo and Kern counties.\n\nBut by early Friday, Pacific Gas and Electric Co said it restored power to most of its 178,000 customers in portions of 18 counties shut off, and it expected to have the rest reconnected by the end of the day.\n\nWhile the cause of the worst of the blazes, the Kincade Fire in Sonoma County, has not been determined, it appears to have erupted near the base of a damaged high-voltage transmission tower owned by PG&E.\n\nThe company, a unit of bankrupt holding company PG&E Corp (PCG.N), said in an \u201celectric safety incident\u201d report to the California Public Utilities Commission that one of its power lines malfunctioned at about the time and in the location of the fire\u2019s origin on Wednesday night.\n\nPG&E shares were down about 26% in morning trade on concerns about its potential liability.\n\nNeither PG&E nor the commission said whether the damaged tower or the malfunctioning transmission line attached to it were suspected of igniting the blaze, which has destroyed about a dozen homes and other structures.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said it is investigating. It listed the same place and time of origin for the fire as the tower incident reported by PG&E.\n\nBy early Friday, the Kincade fire had scorched about 16,000 acres and forced some 2,000 people to flee their homes, the Cal Fire agency said.\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\nNo injuries have been reported and only 800 acres had been contained, it said.\n\nMandatory evacuations began with the 900 residents of historic Geyserville on Thursday, and continued climbing to 2,000 across Sonoma County through the day, the county sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\nGeyserville and nearby Healdsburg, part of which was under an evacuation warning, are hubs of upscale restaurants, wine-tasting rooms, inns and shops surrounded by hills dotted with vineyards about 75 miles (120 km) north of San Francisco.", "description": "California firefighters on Friday sought to take advantage of a brief lull in high winds behind fast-moving wildfires that forced the evacuation of more than 40,000 residents north of Los Angeles and another 2,000 in the state's wine country.", "authors": ["Stephen Lam", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444913837&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1EP", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
