He went eight games without scoring and had not scored at home and you could feel it getting pent up a little bit.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThen he scored a hat-trick against Houston where everything he hit went in. He got that hat-trick and the floodgates then opened.\n\n\u201cYou see his glimpses of his ability. He showed it in the summer with Paraguay at the Copa America\n\n\u201cHis pace with the ball is incredible. I always likened it to Gareth Bale from my time at Spurs \u2013 he always seems quicker when he has got the ball than without the ball. It is about confidence.\n\n\"I just hope he can get that first goal and then they will come in waves.\u201d\n\nAlmiron, who was surrounded by Spanish speakers in Atlanta, was bought by Rafa Benitez last season and played with Ayoze Perez and Salomon Rondon.\n\nNow with Steve Bruce he is trying to form new partnerships with new record signing Joelinton and Allan-Saint Maximin.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHe had only 24 touches in the win over Manchester United and failed to find the target with three shots.\n\n\u201cIt is always difficult when you are signed by one manager - a Spanish speaker in particular - and he has now gone,\u201d Eales added.\n\n\u201cBut he always works his socks off. He was great going forward for us but he also did the dirty work tackling back.\n\n\u201cHe is not primarily a goalscorer but he can score goals, And he is just lightning with the ball in transition. We were just a devastating counter-attacking team when Migie was with us.\n\n\"The number of goals where we would just feed him the ball and let him run and he would pass to Jose Martinez to finish the goal.\n\n\u201cIf I have got him in my team, I am looking for ways to get him on the break in circumstances where he can use that pace to get beyond the defence.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The Paraguay striker is yet to hit the back of the net since joining from Atlanta for \u00a321m", "authors": ["Neil Mcleman", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20548702.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
