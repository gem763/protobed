(AP) - Something will have to give Saturday when Mississippi State brings the Southeastern Conference\u2019s leading rusher into No. 7 Auburn to face one of the league\u2019s stingiest run defenses.\n\nMississippi State\u2019s Kylin Hill has run for over 100 yards in each of his team\u2019s first four games and has a total of 551 yards rushing - 143 more than anyone else in the SEC.\n\nAuburn (4-0, 1-0 SEC) features one of the nation\u2019s top defensive lines and allows just 89.5 rushing yards per game to rank second in the SEC. That group will be seeking revenge after Auburn lost 23-9 to Mississippi State (3-1, 1-0) last season.\n\n\u201cThey have a lot of experience, a couple of NFL guys on the defensive line,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThe majority of the success we had last year was the play calling by coach (Joe) Moorhead, and he called the right plays against the right defense.\u201d\n\nHill rushed for 126 yards and former Mississippi State quarterback Nick Fitzgerald ran for 195 yards against Auburn last season.\n\nNow that Fitzgerald has departed, Hill has taken over as the featured player in Mississippi State\u2019s rushing attack.\n\nLast year, Hill had 117 rushing attempts in 11 games. After four games in 2019, Hill has already totaled an SEC-leading 91 carries.\n\nThe only Football Bowl Subdivision players with more carries are Oklahoma State\u2019s Chuba Hubbard (103), Boston College\u2019s A.J. Dillon (99) and Florida State\u2019s Cam Akers (98).\n\n\u201cHistorically, backs in this offense have had well over 200 carries,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cWe utilized the quarterback in the run game more last year, and now that we\u2019re throwing it better, we are seeing better numbers and giving some of those carries to the tailback instead of the quarterback. I believe Kylin can carry this workload by the way he approaches it and how he\u2019s prepared himself.\u201d\n\nHill has 20 rushes that covered 10 yards or more - the most of any FBS player. Hill either leads or is tied for the lead in nine different offensive categories in the SEC.\n\nAuburn coach Gus Malzahn praised Hill\u2019s explosiveness and cited a play from Mississippi State\u2019s 28-13 victory over Kentucky last week in which he dove across the goal line from over 4 yards away.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a veteran guy, he\u2019s been there and done that,\u201d Malzahn said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best in our league.\u201d\n\nHill says he\u2019s benefited from Mississippi State\u2019s improved passing game.\n\nA year ago, Mississippi State quarterbacks completed just 51.5 percent of their pass attempts. This year, Tommy Stevens and Garrett Shrader have combined to complete 64 percent of their passes.\n\n\u201cOnce the passing game gets going it takes a lot of pressure off me,\u201d Hill said. \u201cRight now we\u2019re a very balanced team.\u201d\n\nHill and the Bulldogs will face a big challenge trying to match the success they had against Auburn last season, when they rushed for 349 yards.\n\nAuburn has held three of its first four opponents this season below 100 yards rushing. Auburn\u2019s Derrick Brown is the reigning SEC defensive lineman of the week after teammate Marlon Davidson earned that honor each of the previous two weeks.\n\nMississippi State utilized a lot of pre-snap motion last year to keep the Tigers\u2019 defense off stride. Moorhead said his offense will need to do more of the same Saturday to succeed against a defensive line that he considers among the best in the country.\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate to do that last year and we did some things to keep them off-balanced, maybe some misdirection things that we had not normally done,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cBut you are not going to just line up and run the ball downhill on these guys. It doesn\u2019t work that way and we have to find creative ways to find space and angles.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Something will have to give Saturday when Mississippi State brings the Southeastern Conference's leading rusher into No. 7 Auburn to face one of the league's stingiest run defenses.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Jones"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/kentucky_mississippi_st_football_44286_c0-206-4921-3075_s1770x1032.jpg?e2b56d88622cbb994a2b2cedc0bbc9af5218c8f6", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
