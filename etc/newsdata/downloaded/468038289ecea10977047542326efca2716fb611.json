HEPA, +112.00% soared 45% in very active premarket trading Thursday, after the biopharmaceutical company published data showing potential for its CRV431 to be a drug candidate for liver disease treatment. Trading volume swelled to 1.5 million shares, enough to make Hepion's stock the most actively traded ahead of the open, and about 14-times the full-day average of about 110,000 shares. The company said CRV431 inhibited all cyclophilin isoforms tested, suggesting it could be used to target multiple disease mechanisms in the liver. \"We believe that targeting these pathways is necessary for optimal treatment of chronic liver diseases including NASH, cancer, and viral hepatitis,\" said Hepion Chief Executive Robert Foster. \"Further, we believe that CRV431's pan-cyclophilin inhibition is well-suited to address multiple therapeutic needs that are currently either underserved, or completely absent.\" The stock has tumbled 31.5% over the past three months through Wednesday, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF IBB, +0.81% has slipped 3.1% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.51% has gained 0.2%.", "description": "Shares of Hepion Pharmaceuticals Inc. soared 45% in very active premarket trading Thursday, after the biopharmaceutical company published data showing...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
