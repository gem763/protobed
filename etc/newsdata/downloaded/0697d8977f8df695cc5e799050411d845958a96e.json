But the government has maintained that the region has been largely calm.\n\nArticle 370, as the constitutional provision guaranteeing special status was known, allowed the region a certain amount of autonomy, including special privileges in property ownership, education and jobs. This provision had underpinned India's often fraught relationship with Kashmir.", "description": "After 72 days, millions of mobiles have once again become operational in the region.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/039A/production/_109222900_mediaitem109222899.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
