House investigators want to understand if they played any role or have more information about Trump\u2019s efforts to press Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for damaging information about the former vice president, who is now a Democratic presidential contender and top Trump rival.\n\nVolker resigned on Friday after being asked to testify to Congress about the whistleblower complaint that describes how Trump, in a July 25 phone call, repeatedly prodded Zelensky for an investigation of Biden and his son Hunter, while his administration delayed the release of military aid to help Ukraine fight Russia-backed separatists. The complaint says Volker met in Kyiv with Zelensky and other Ukrainian political figures a day after the call, and he provided advice about how to \u201cnavigate\u201d Trump\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cI think he was doing the best he could,\u201d said retired senior U.S. diplomat Daniel Fried, who described the actions of his former colleague as trying to guide Ukrainians on \u201chow to deal with President Trump under difficult circumstances.\u201d\n\nVolker agreed to a voluntary interview with lawmakers and congressional staff, led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California, as Democrats dig deeper into the administration\u2019s handling of Ukraine.\n\nVolker, who also served as head of the John McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University, was said to be eager to appear and tell his side of the situation.\n\nThe former envoy was in office as the administration was holding back $250 million for Ukraine at the time Trump was pressing Zelenskiy about the Bidens. Volker told the House investigators it was unusual for the U.S. to withhold aid to Ukraine, but said he was given no explanation for it, the person said.\n\nRepublican lawmakers who took part in the interview with Volker downplayed what they heard.\n\n\u201cNot one thing he has said comports with any of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment narrative, not one thing,\u201d said Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.\n\nRepublicans also argued that because Democrats have not yet voted in the House to open a formal impeachment inquiry, Democrats lack the authority to set certain rules for the hearing.\n\nRepublicans are increasingly calling the impeachment proceedings into question as a way to sow doubt and put pressure on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to force a vote that would put Democrats on record for an impeachment inquiry.\n\nKevin McCarthy, the leader of House Republicans, said Pelosi should halt proceedings until then. \u201cThe American people deserve assurance that basic standards of due process will be present,\u201d he said in a letter to the speaker.\n\nIn response, Pelosi said in a letter to McCarthy that \u201cthere is no requirement under the Constitution, under House Rules, or House precedent that the whole House vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cWe hope you and other Republicans share our commitment to following the facts.\u201d\n\nAs the impeachment inquiry focuses on Ukraine, Trump doubled down Thursday by publicly calling on China to also investigate Biden and his family, potentially setting off more alarms in Congress.\n\n\u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Trump said outside the White House. Trump said he hadn\u2019t directly asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to investigate, but it\u2019s \u201ccertainly something we could start thinking about.\u201d\n\nSee: Trump urges China and Ukraine alike to probe Joe Biden and son Hunter\n\nThe State Department\u2019s role in Ukraine has become deeply entangled in the impeachment inquiry as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed that he was also on Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky.\n\nThe State Department said Volker has confirmed that he put a Zelensky adviser in contact with Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, at the Ukrainian adviser\u2019s request, and Giuliani has said he was in frequent contact with Volker.\n\nVolker told investigators Thursday he warned Giuliani not to rely on information coming from Ukraine\u2019s former top prosecutor, Yuri Lutsenko. The former prosecutor general reportedly had been in contact with Giuliani, the person said.\n\nGiuliani has played a central role in Trump\u2019s efforts to launch a Ukrainian corruption probe into the Bidens that\u2019s now part of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nHunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration\u2019s diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Although the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.\n\nSeparately, the Associated Press reported on Wednesday that Volker met last year with a top official from the same Ukrainian energy firm that paid Hunter Biden to serve on its board. The meeting occurred even as Giuliani pressed Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate the company and the Bidens\u2019 involvement with it.\n\nPompeo accused the congressional investigators of trying to \u201cbully\u201d and \u201cintimidate\u201d State Department officials with subpoenas for documents and testimony, suggesting he would seek to prevent them from providing information. But the committee managed to schedule the deposition with Volker, as well as one next week with Marie Yovanovitch, who was U.S. ambassador to Ukraine until she was removed from the post last spring.", "description": "Speaker Pelosi to House Minority Leader McCarthy: \u2018We hope you and other Republicans share our commitment to following the facts.\u2019", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS630_volker_ZG_20191003171221.jpg"}
