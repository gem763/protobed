Schumer of New York said Wednesday that White House hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke is the only fellow Democrat he knows in support of confiscating certain guns.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O\u2019Rourke, but it\u2019s no excuse not to go forward,\u201d Mr. Schumer said, the Times Union of Albany reported.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke, a former Texas congressman seeking the Democratic nomination to run in 2020 against President Trump, has campaigned on enacting sweeping gun control measures if elected, including banning semi-automatic weapons used in recent mass shootings and implementing a mandatory \u201cbuyback\u201d program requiring gun owners to sell them to the government.\n\n\u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said during the Democratic presidential primary debate last week. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\u201d\n\nVirtually all major Democratic presidential candidates have spoken in favor of reforming existing gun laws, though Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposed plan has been roundly rejected by most Republicans in addition to some members of his own party.\n\n\u201cI can tell you one thing: Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s not taking my guns away from me,\u201d Sen. Joe Manchin, West Virginia Democrat, said Wednesday.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Americans surveyed said they support banning assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons, according to the results of a Fox News poll released last month, including 86% of Democratic respondents and 46% of Republicans.\n\nBipartisan members of Congress have recently been in negotiations with the White House in hopes of drafting new gun control measures agreed by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\n\nWeighing in Wednesday morning on Twitter, Mr. Trump claimed Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal was making it \u201cmuch harder\u201d to reach a deal, however, accusing the candidate of making it seem like Democrats \u201cjust want to take your guns away.\u201d\n\nAt least three of Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s fellow Democratic presidential hopefuls \u2014 Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio \u2014 support \u201csome form of mandatory buyback,\u201d NPR reported last week.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
