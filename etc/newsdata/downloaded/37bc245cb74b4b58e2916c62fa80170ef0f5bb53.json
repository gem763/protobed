It is important to me that we all work to educate children and families about the dangers associated with this habit.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs is typical at her events, she did not answer any questions from reporters.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump was sending out tweets that Politico\u2019s chief Washington correspondent Ryan Lizza declared in his own tweet to be \u201cobjectively insane.\u201d\n\nEarly Monday morning the White House had announced it would be withdrawing U.S. troops from northern Syria, clearing the way for a presumed Turkish offensive, leaving vulnerable Kurdish fighters who\u2019d allied with the United States in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\n\u201c. . . If Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done it before!) . . . ,\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nAD\n\nIn response, some people circulated an April 2012 tweet from the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka thanking the Turkish prime minister for his help in facilitating the massive two-pronged Trump Towers in Istanbul. Others circulated a 2015 radio interview in which Donald Trump admitted the towers might present \u201ca little conflict of interest.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMelania Trump is busier than you think, but as quiet as ever\n\nBy dawn, news was breaking that a judge had ruled President Trump was not immune to prosecution and had ordered him to turn over eight years of his tax returns to the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office for the continued investigation into payments of hush money for his alleged affair with adult-movie star and director Stormy Daniels. The president immediately appealed the ruling\n\nThis is not the first time in the past two weeks (yes, it\u2019s been only two weeks) that the first lady has put herself in the spotlight while seeming to ignore any of the chaos surrounding her husband. (Or her family. Yesterday, The Washington Post broke the story that Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, had earned $82 million in 2017 while working as public servants on the administration.)\n\nAD\n\nOn Sept. 24, the day that news of the impeachment inquiry broke, Melania Trump had been with her husband as he addressed the U.N. General Assembly. That afternoon, her Instagram account posted a glamorous, sepia-toned photo slide show of her in a Gucci cream-colored wool coat. The night of the speech, she and her husband met with the president of Ukraine at a private assembly. That gathering appeared on none of their social accounts.\n\nAD\n\nThen Thursday, when Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, was meeting with congressional investigators, and President Trump was calling for both Ukraine and China to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, Melania Trump was about as far away from Washington as she could get. She was floating down Wyoming\u2019s Snake River in view of the Grand Tetons with a group of Boy Scouts to promote a pass to national parks for fourth-graders. Her staff told the pool following her \u2014 made up of only local reporters \u2014 that the merry rafters had spotted a bald eagle.\n\nFrom her smiles in photos circulated of the two-day trip she seemed to be loving it.\n\nAD\n\nWhile this may seem like counterprogramming or a wife who wants to distance herself from her husband\u2019s affairs, Princeton historian Lauren M. Wright said these events may have subtle meaning. \u201cFirst ladies are the very, very best strategic messengers in the White House because they\u2019re apolitical,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can hide behind this image of someone who is a do-gooding volunteer and a popular nonpartisan figure.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn other words, this first lady\u2019s enjoyment of the outdoors might distract both from the impeachment news and reports that her husband\u2019s border wall construction is bulldozing through indigenous sacred sites and 150-year-old Saguaro cactuses in Arizona\u2019s Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument \u2014 an area designed to protect those very plants.\n\nBack at the DEA headquarters, the first lady was continuing about her day unfazed.\n\nAD\n\nYoung Marines presented the colors. A choir from H-B Woodlawn High School in Arlington sang a choral rendition of the national anthem. Actor Dean Norris, who played a DEA special agent on \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d emceed. Acting DEA administrator Uttam Dhillon told the heartbreaking story of special agent Enrique \u201cKiki\u201d Camarena, who was kidnapped, tortured and murdered by drug traffickers in Guadalajara, Mexico, in 1985. Members of his community began wearing red ribbons in his honor to symbolize their resolve in the fight against the drug trade.\n\nAD\n\nThe first lady did not wear a red ribbon. Staff from the East Wing said she had not received one before the event.\n\nStill, she took the stage, her head moving to follow the teleprompter, the speech almost identical to the one she\u2019d prepared. She sincerely told Camarena\u2019s widow, Mika, \u201cI am so sorry for your loss,\u201d but never diverted her gaze from the teleprompters.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSince its launch last year, I have used Be Best to shine a light on programs and people that show what it means to be best,\u201d the first lady said.\n\nMelania Trump marks the first anniversary of Be Best\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s showing a simple act of kindness, providing care where there is a need, or teaching something valuable, Be Best promotes the positive actions happening in our communities and around the globe and helps children understand what it means to lead healthy lives,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nUnlike previous remarks that the first lady gave at the opening of the Kennedy Center\u2019s expansion last month or a recent New York Stock Exchange event, there was a punch and specificity to her speech.\n\nShe detailed how she\u2019d used the past 2\u00bd years as first lady to travel to hospitals and rehab centers \u201cwhere I have seen firsthand the horrible results of drug abuse.\u201d She mentioned an event she\u2019d done with students of Liberty University to address \u201cthe stigma of drug dependence.\u201d\n\nAnd then she made her fiery stance on vaping, the first time she\u2019s spoken publicly on the issue \u2014 though she did mention it on social media.\n\nBy the end of those five minutes at the lectern, she hadn\u2019t touched on impeachment or the 21 tweets and retweets her husband made in the previous 24 hours. But she had said more than she has, publicly, in months. It almost sounded like a stump speech.\n\nAD", "description": "At recent events, the first lady has steadfastly focused on her Be Best campaign", "authors": ["Jada Yuan", "Feature Reporter Covering National Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/X584Sje-gigM-7t_yJdZ1u5EwwE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZKF63IHJFUI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
