Sandy Hooper, USA TODAY\n\nIn 2012, it was Katie Ledecky, the then-15-year-old swimmer who stunned the pack \u2013 and the world \u2013 with her gold-medal winning display in the 800-meter freestyle. She finished more than four seconds ahead of the field, shattered an American record and nearly took down the world record.\n\nAnd in 2016, it was gymnast Simone Biles who became a household name around the world as she claimed gold in the sport\u2019s biggest event \u2013 the women\u2019s individual all-around. Biles was already a star in gymnastics, having won her first world title in the all-around in 2013. But in Rio, her star power went off the charts when she won three individual gold medals and a bronze. She also led the Final Five to team gold.\n\nTICKETS TO TIME ZONES: All the key info for the 2020 Summer Olympics\n\nNO POOL PARTY: Anti-doping rebellion rises a year from Tokyo Olympics\n\nAhead of the 2020 Olympics, which is now one year away, here\u2019s a look at 15 athletes who could become rising stars for Team USA next summer:\n\nCaroline Marks, surfing\n\nMarks became the youngest surfer ever to qualify for the Championship Tour in 2017 as a 15-year-old. Now 17, Marks is coming off a strong 2018 campaign in which she finished seventh on the women\u2019s tour and earned Rookie of the Year honors. With surfing debuting as an Olympic sport come 2020, Marks will face steep competition to earn one of the USA\u2019s two spots in the women\u2019s field. But the newcomer opened the 2019 season strong, winning the Boost Mobile Pro Gold Coast event in April.\n\nMorgan Hurd, 18, won all-around gold at the 2017 world championships. (Photo: Timothy D. Easley, AP)\n\nMorgan Hurd, gymnastics\n\nAt 18, Hurd has already experienced success in Tokyo. At the 2019 Tokyo World Cup, Hurd won gold in the all-around competition, adding another medal to an already crowded portfolio. She won all-around gold at the 2017 world championships and took silver on beam, and in 2018 at worlds she won silver on floor and bronze in the all-around. She also has been included in the filming of a year-long documentary from the Olympic Channel, following three gymnasts on the road to the Tokyo Games.\n\nBrighton Zeuner, skateboarding\n\nIn another sport making its Olympics debut, Zeuner has a shot to find her way to Tokyo in a year\u2019s time. As a 13-year-old, she became the youngest gold medalist in X Games history, winning the park event in 2017. And the next year, she became the youngest skater to win in back-to-back years. So at 15, Zeuner is no newbie to winning medals. She could be part of Team USA\u2019s contingent in Tokyo, attempting to win yet another gold.\n\nMichael Andrew, swimming\n\nAs a 17-year-old, Andrew missed out on making it to the 2016 Olympics by 0.64 seconds. In the 100-meter breaststroke, Andrew broke the junior world record at the Olympic Trials but finished fourth overall in the final. Since then, Andrew, now 20, won gold in the 50-meter freestyle at the 2018 Pan Pacific Championships and he captured five medals \u2014 four golds and one silver \u2014 as a member of Team USA relays at the 2018 Short Course World Championships.\n\nKanak Jha, table tennis\n\nJha has already been to the Olympics \u2014 he was the youngest American athlete to compete at the 2016 Games \u2014 but now as a 19-year-old, Jha is far and away the top American table tennis player. He ranks No. 37 in the world, according to the International Table Tennis Federation, and he won bronze at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics and secured his fourth straight national title in 2019.\n\nRachel Garcia, softball\n\nGarcia led UCLA to a national championship in 2019, finishing her college season with a 1.14 ERA in 202 innings, as well as a .343 batting average. Her success hasn\u2019t been isolated to the Bruins, and she could factor in heavily to Team USA\u2019s plans when softball returns to the Olympics in 2020. At the WBSC Women\u2019s World Championship in 2018, Garcia held a 1.05 ERA with 13 strikeouts through 6 2/3 innings as the Americans went on to win gold.\n\nCJ Cummings, weightlifting\n\nIf Cummings wasn\u2019t known well known before, his performance at the 2019 Pan American Weightlifting Championships made him a star in the sport. The Beaufort, S.C. native set 15 American, Pan American and world records in Guatemala City as an 18-year-old. Cummings now seems poised to qualify for the 2020 Olympics and could add to an already impressive career, which includes a win in the 73 kg class at the World Junior Championships this year, too.\n\nDelaney Schnell, diving\n\nSchnell has made a strong case for a place among the U.S. divers headed to Japan if she can get through trials next year. After a 14-year medal drought in the women\u2019s 10-meter platform event at the FINA World Championships, Team USA made it back on the podium as Schnell earned bronze. The 20-year-old is firmly in the conversation to make the team for Tokyo. Schnell, entering her junior year at Arizona, made the finals at the World Championships for the first time and went on to win her first world championship medal, and her country\u2019s first in the event since 2005.\n\nMargo Hayes, climbing\n\nClimbing is making its Olympic debut in Tokyo, and because the competitors must compete in all three disciplines \u2014 bouldering, speed and lead \u2014 it\u2019s beneficial for them to be well-rounded. Hayes can do it all. In 2016 at the IFSC World Youth Championships, Hayes placed first overall, winning the bouldering and lead events while finishing 15th in speed. The next year, she made history by becoming the first woman to climb a 5.15a-rated route.\n\nNoah Lyles, track and field\n\nLyles opted to turn pro in 2016 instead of competing at the University of Florida, and he\u2019s since become one of the top sprinters in the world. Four times in 2018, Lyles broke the 19.7-second mark in the 200 meters. The only other sprinter to achieve that feat was Usain Bolt. As Lyles prepares for the USATF Outdoor Championships in Des Moines this week, he announced he\u2019s only running in the 200 rather than trying the 100-200 double. Instead, Lyles plans to run both events at the Olympic Trials next year.\n\nSydney McLaughlin, track and field\n\nMcLaughlin has already been to the Olympics, when the then-16-year-old high schooler qualified for the Rio Games and became the youngest U.S. Olympian to compete in track and field since 1972. In Rio, she finished 16th in the 400-meter hurdles. But four years later, McLaughlin looks poised to break out as a medal contender in Tokyo. The 19-year-old finished first in the 400-meter hurdles at the 2018 NCAA championships for Kentucky before turning pro later that year. Last month she won gold at the Diamond League meet in Oslo, Norway.\n\nTom Schaar, skateboarding\n\nIn 2012, Schaar spun \u2014 and landed \u2014 his way into the record books. As a 12-year-old, Schaar became the first skateboarder to land a 1080, which is three rotations, and he became the youngest skater to win gold at an X Games event. Now 19, Schaar is a member of the USA Skateboarding team for the park event, and he could find his way to Tokyo for the 2020 Olympics if he qualifies.\n\nJosh Sargent, soccer\n\nAfter missing out on the 2018 World Cup, the U.S. men\u2019s soccer team has gone through an overhaul. Young stars such as Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie are getting chances center stage. But Sargent, the youngest-ever to score for the USA at a U-20 World Cup, hasn\u2019t yet broken through into the senior team, having been left off the Gold Cup squad. That could change if the U.S. qualifies for the Olympics. At 19, the Werder Bremen striker would love a chance to show he can be a goal-scoring threat for the Americans.\n\nAndi Sullivan, soccer\n\nHer Washington Spirit teammates Rose Lavelle and Mallory Pugh made the World Cup squad and went on to win it all, with Lavelle scoring in the final. Sullivan, one of the last names left off the roster, had to watch her two roommates play in France from home. But the 23-year-old midfielder, who\u2019s the team captain for the NWSL\u2019s Spirit, could make the jump to Team USA when it has another go at a trophy at the 2020 Olympic Games.\n\nDaton Fix, wrestling\n\nFix, a high-school wrestling standout in Oklahoma, continued that success in a big way when he jumped up a level in Stillwater. The 133-pounder for Oklahoma State went 34-2 in the regular season of his redshirt freshman year in 2018-19, finishing as a runner-up in the NCAA championships, and becoming the youngest wrestler to make the U.S. senior world team since 1987.", "description": "With the Tokyo Games a year away, who is poised to follow the likes of Katie Ledecky and Simone Biles in breaking through at the Olympics?", "authors": ["Andrew Kostka", "Usa Today Sports", "Published A.M.
