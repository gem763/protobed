REUTERS/Dante Carrer/File Photo\n\nCruise ships have pulled in and out of the capital and tourist hub Nassau in the two weeks since Hurricane Dorian struck the northwestern islands, depositing foreign sightseers on shore who haggle for conch shells and T-shirts.\n\nWaiters at the bayside Se\u00f1or Frogs restaurant pour electric blue liquor shots straight into revelers\u2019 mouths, while at the Fat Tuesday frozen daiquiri bar nearby the sun-burned masses cool off with spiked pineapple-mango smoothies.\n\nWorkers in the country\u2019s vital tourist trade are hoping for a quick comeback, even as the Bahamas struggles with its first steps toward recovery from a storm that killed at least 50 people and left around 70,000 more needing shelter, food and water and medical aid.\n\nThe sector faces many challenges: Two popular tourist destinations \u2014 Abaco and the island of Grand Bahama \u2014 were essentially swept off the tourist maps by Dorian.\n\n\u201cThose were our second and third most important destinations,\u201d said Ellison \u201cTommy\u201d Thompson, deputy director general of the ministry of tourism and aviation.\n\nThompson said no one was talking about \u201cthrowing up our hands and giving up\u201d on the hard-hit islands. But the images of the devastation have affected everyone from tour operators on the islands to U.S.-based travel agents who help connect travelers with cruise ships and activities.\n\nHighlighting the destruction, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was \u201chorrified\u201d on Saturday after taking an aerial tour of Abaco.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a level of systematic devastation,\u201d Guterres told reporters. \u201cHurricane Dorian has been classified as Category 5, I think it is Category Hell, but it was not powered by the devil.\u201d\n\nTourism last year accounted for $5.7 billion, about half the country\u2019s gross domestic product, according to Thompson.\n\nAway from Nassau\u2019s tourist strip, luxury hotels were also bustling. At Baha Mar, an opulent hotel and entertainment complex, the casino floor was littered with vacationers shooting craps, sipping martinis at a piano bar and ordering $100-plus platters of sushi.\n\nJust over 90 miles (145 km) to the north, the hunt for bodies continued amid the wreckage of Abaco, where the United Nations\u2019 World Food Programme says about 90% of structures were destroyed.\n\n\u201cThis has devastated our spirits and we are mourning with our friends who lost loved but the reality is that life has to go on,\u201d said construction company owner Jackson Brennen, 57, who was celebrating his wife\u2019s birthday at Nassau\u2019s Baha Mar.\n\n\u201cOnly two of the islands were devastated, we\u2019re still open for business, but it\u2019s very difficult because the pain hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201d\n\nDave Curry, 37, who followed his father into the tour business, has run Simply Dave Nassau Tours for the last 20 years. His day trips pull people away from the high prices and tourist traps of downtown Nassau to visit historical sites and a local flea market in residential areas.\n\nSince Dorian, Curry said his bookings had dropped by about a quarter due to a rash of cancellations.\n\nThe slowdown has delivered a kind of one-two punch, as the Bahamas moves into a seasonal lull following the U.S. Labor Day holiday weekend.\n\nCurry likened recent events to the period after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, when many people in the Bahamas had friends and family who were impacted.\n\n\u201cIt was a time of remorse, it was a time of stillness and consciousness and that\u2019s what you feel right now on the islands,\u201d Curry said.\n\nU.S. visitors are among those who have thought twice about Bahamas trips after viewing images of Dorian\u2019s devastation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen 450 to 550 changes and cancellations,\u201d said Gus Machado, sales director at Brickell Travel in Miami.\n\nWhile some canceled trips out of fear of getting caught in storm force winds, Machado said others were simply frightened out of travel by the idea of seeing devastated islands.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A rainbow appears before the arrival of Hurricane Dorian in Marsh Harbour, on the Great Abaco Island, Bahamas, August 31, 2019. REUTERS/Dante Carrer/File Photo\n\nThat mindset is something Thompson and others in the tourism ministry hope to fight by emphasizing that islands such as Eleuthera, his personal favorite, boast tranquil pink sand beaches ripe for visitors.\n\n\u201cThe business of tourism has to go on in order for us to get the revenue to rebuild,\u201d Thompson said.\n\n\u201cThe best way you can help is to continue to visit the islands of the Bahamas and while you\u2019re here maybe stay an extra day, and spend an extra $50.\u201d", "description": "As rescuers search for bodies amid mountains of debris and the stench of death on the Bahamas island of Abaco, life on most of the archipelago's 700 isles is little changed.", "authors": ["Zachary Fagenson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430091920&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E09W", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
