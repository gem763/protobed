However, when you\u2019re deep in the throes of young love, there comes a point when it can be hard to keep your hands off of each other. Chalamet and Depp are in this phase of their relationship, as evidenced by this horny display of deep frenching on a yacht in Capri, Italy. This, of course, makes it the perfect time to debut their celebrity couple portmanteau: Limoth\u00e9e.\n\nAs we all know, the celebrity couple nickname is a time-honored tradition in which the names of two famous people are combined into one, so we may refer to their existence in one breath. It is an important step for every Hollywood couple, from Brangelina, to Kimye, to Speidi. Some may even compare it to getting knighted by the Queen. Congratulations, Limoth\u00e9e, on joining the ranks of this esteemed consortium.\n\nJust a few days before their at-sea make-out session, the 23-year-old Chalamet and 20-year-old Depp walked the red carpet at the Venice Film Festival for their upcoming film, The King. Chalamet stars in the title role as a royal bowl cut, and Depp plays his love interest, Catherine of Valois.\n\nI, for one, want to thank Limoth\u00e9e for filling the hole in my heart where Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson used to be. Of course, those two never really had their own cool joint nickname (Grandson? I don\u2019t think so), and probably couldn\u2019t speak some sexy French to each other like Chalamet and Depp can, so the odds of this romance are clearly already in Limoth\u00e9e\u2019s favor.\n\nStay in touch.
