The bank used this information to promote mortgages with incentives for energy efficiency, Kees van Dijkhuizen, CEO of ABN AMRO, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOur experience in the Netherlands is that measuring and tracking climate impact drives concrete action and change,\u201d he said.", "description": "Over 50 banks and other financial institutions representing nearly $3 trillion in assets announced on Monday they will assess and disclose the impact their loans and investments will have on climate change using common carbon accounting standards.", "authors": ["Valerie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
