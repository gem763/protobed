Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY). \u201cHe\u2019s up to his neck in criminals and dirty money. Was he playing the President to get himself paid? Seems there\u2019s no honor among thieves.\u201d\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Giuliani\u2019s finances have been a component of House Democratic investigations into the pressure campaign that the former New York City mayor and President Trump applied to Ukrainian leadership in order to persuade them to investigate the work Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, was doing in that country. But CNN reported that his financial dealings are under renewed scrutiny by investigators following the arrests of two clients, Soviet-born businessmen Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, on Thursday for campaign finance violations. And Maloney\u2019s comments suggest that there is an appetite for congressional investigators to better understand the money-trail as well.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Beast this week, Giuliani steadfastly denied that he was paid for any work he did in Ukraine, saying that he helped Trump on a \u201cpro bono\u201d basis. He said that the costs of his travel were covered by private clients for separate work that happened to correspond with his Ukraine portfolio. Speaking specifically about an August trip he made to Madrid to urge Andriy Yermak, a top Ukrainian official, to reinvestigate the Bidens, Giuliani said that he happened to be going to the Spanish capital already for \u201cbusiness and vacation.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Stein", "Thedailybeast.Com Democrats-Want-To-Know-Who-Paid-Rudy-Giuliani"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
