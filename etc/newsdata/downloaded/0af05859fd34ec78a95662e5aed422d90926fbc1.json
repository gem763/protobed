Ransomware attacks increased 118 percent in 2019, equaling 504 new threats per minute, in the first quarter, according to a McAfee report.\n\nWannaCryFake is a variant of the infamous WannaCry ransomware that targeted Microsoft computers in 2017. It locks victims\u2019 files using AES-256, or the advanced encryption standard.\n\nAn infected victim will receive a message that says:\n\n\u201cYou have to pay for decryption in bitcoins. The price depends on how fast you write to us. After payment we will send you the tool that will decrypt all your files.\u201d\n\nVictims are instructed to contact the ransomware distributors through ProtonMail or Telegram, and are then provided steps on how to send bitcoin through Pidgin.\n\nThough the virus suggests LocalBitcoin\u2019s as the \u201ceasiest way to buy bitcoin,\u201d it also sources CoinDesk\u2019s beginners\u2019 guide to bitcoin for users unfamiliar with the digital currency.\n\nThe malware also warns, \u201cDecryption of your files with the help of third parties may cause increased price (they add their fee to our) or you can become a victim of a scam.\u201d\n\nOnce downloaded, the Emsisoft Decryptor uses the encrypted file and the original unencrypted version to piece together the keys needed to decrypt locked data. Because the protocol uses filename extensions to determine the encryption parameters, users are instructed not to rename their files.\n\nEmsisoft\u2019s software allows users to keep a record of the decryption process by using the Save Log button.\n\nIn addition to an increase in bitcoin ransoming malware, crypto-jacking scams are up 29 percent in the first half of 2019, despite the difficulty in mining due to bitcoin\u2019s increasing hash rate.\n\nHacker photo via Shutterstock", "description": "Software-firm Emsisoft released a bug fix for the bitcoin-ransoming malware, WannaCryFake.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hacker.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
