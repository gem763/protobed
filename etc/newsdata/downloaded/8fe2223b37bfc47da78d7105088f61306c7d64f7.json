Some people died on the way, it\u2019s only god who kept me alive. I still fell sick in the desert, with no water, food, nothing. that\u2019s how I got here.\n\nNow, my way to work, I was arrested too. The policemen harass us. They come to our room to beat us, they flog us. They treat us as if we are slaves,\u201d said one teenage boy.\n\nFamine crisis in Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan & Yemen: We can and must act now to save lives guardian</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/UMccJNG5xC\">https://t.co/UMccJNG5xC</a></p>\u2014 UNICEF ( UNICEF) February 24, 2017\n\nThe survivors may be street smart, but those the authorities manage to save are badly damaged. The others remain hard to reach.\n\n\u201cFor many of these kids the only currency they have is their own bodies and that\u2019s what keeps them on the street, hustling; it\u2019s what gets them food, it\u2019s what gets them air time for their cell phone card, which is their only connection to other kids.\n\nI think what we\u2019re creating is a human tragedy that is going to last us for generations to come. Because once these children are on the street and this is their life, it gets very difficult to get them off,\u201d says UNICEF\u2019s Regional Director and Special Coordinator for the Refugee and Migrant Crisis in Europe, Afshan Khan.\n\nThese victims are currently operating under Europe\u2019s bright lights, often captives of organised crime, highly vulnerable, and at risk.
