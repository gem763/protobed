But my God, the stakes are high", "language": "en", "text": "What do we ask of Boris Johnson? That he avoids handing power to an alliance of opposition parties which could come together under the prime ministership of Jeremy Corbyn. And that he finally delivers the outcome of the 2016 referendum.\n\nI hope I won't be thought an apostate by fellow Brexiteers if I say that keeping a doddery, unreconstructed Marxist out of No 10 is even more important to me than taking Britain out of the EU.\n\nThe most brilliant politician who ever lived would find it a challenge to scale two formidable peaks at the same time \u2014 vanquishing Mr Corbyn and getting us out of the maw of Brussels.\n\nI feel like a spectator at an old-fashioned circus, craning my neck as I watch Boris try to balance on the high wire. Quite bulky as trapeze artists go, he lurches this way and that, without showing any of the alarm that concerned onlookers inevitably feel. Is it possible he will get across in one piece?\n\nWhat do we ask of Boris Johnson? That he avoids handing power to an alliance of opposition parties which could come together under the prime ministership of Jeremy Corbyn\n\nTo answer that question we should recognise there has been an important change over the past 24 hours. Despite the Government's failure last night in the Commons to secure a general election on December 12, it seems very possible that one will take place around the same time.\n\nIn yesterday's vote, a two-thirds majority was required because of the idiotic Fixed-Term Parliaments Act. This wasn't obtainable because Labour is 'frit' of being annihilated at an election, and so abstained.\n\nBut the Scottish Nationalists and Liberal Democrats want to introduce a simple Bill which would force an election on December 9, if the Tories were to lend their support. A majority of one vote would do the trick. Such a Bill should therefore pass.\n\nLast night Mr Johnson made clear that the Government will introduce a Bill of its own, almost identical to the one the Scots Nats and Lib Dems have in mind \u2014 but with December 12 as the proposed day of the election, not December 9.\n\nBut one way and another, the date of a General Election could finally be agreed over the coming days, with Jeremy Corbyn being dragged into the voting booth that he and his party have so strenuously avoided\n\nThe reason for such a stratagem is that No 10 will be free to pull its own Bill if it is subject to injurious amendments, such as lowering the voting age to 16, though the Lib Dems (but not the Scots Nats) have said they won't attempt such a ruse.\n\nWhether our friends from north of the border and their new allies will accept this hijacking of their proposal by Boris Johnson remains to be seen. There is a lot of machismo about. No one wants to be seen to be pushed around.\n\nBut one way and another, the date of a General Election could finally be agreed over the coming days, with Jeremy Corbyn being dragged into the voting booth that he and his party have so strenuously avoided.\n\nTime will tell whether Labour has damaged itself by ducking a fight on the spurious grounds that No Deal should first be taken off the table. This lame excuse was invoked even after the EU yesterday morning granted an extension to January 31, eliminating the possibility of No Deal for three months.\n\nThe question that most interests me now is whether Mr Johnson would make a historic error if he were to go to the country before taking us out of the EU. He has repeatedly promised that we would leave this Thursday.\n\nFor although No 10 is now clearly favouring an early election, the die has not yet been cast. It is a momentous decision. If Boris gets it wrong, we could end up with Jeremy Corbyn in No 10 and no Brexit.\n\nThe price of an imminent poll will be an accommodation with the Lib Dems and the Scots Nats. The Government would have to agree not to re-introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which passed by a majority of 30 votes on second reading last Tuesday, this side of an election.\n\nIn particular, would Nigel Farage's uncompromising Brexit Party exploit yet another postponement of Brexit during an election campaign, and take large bites out of the Tories' current significant lead over Labour in the opinion polls?\n\nIn other words, Mr Johnson would have to submit himself to the electorate not only after his promise of 'getting Brexit done' by October 31 had been broken, but without any sort of Brexit having been delivered.\n\nWould voters accept his argument that the failure to come up with the goods should be pinned on a fractious, Remainer-dominated Parliament which has thwarted him at every turn? One may justifiably hope so, but no one can be sure.\n\nIn particular, would Nigel Farage's uncompromising Brexit Party exploit yet another postponement of Brexit during an election campaign, and take large bites out of the Tories' current significant lead over Labour in the opinion polls?\n\nIt is a devilishly difficult dilemma for the Prime Minister.\n\nCabinet ministers Nicky Morgan, Julian Smith and Matt Hancock have qualms about going to the country before Brexit is settled. So too, reportedly, does Sir Edward Lister, the PM's chief strategic adviser.\n\nBut there are also considerable risks on the other side of the ledger. If Mr Johnson delays an election in order to push through the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, intended to take us out of the EU, it could be bogged down for weeks \u2014 and very possibly still not pass.\n\nEndless amendments might be introduced, some of which wouldn't be acceptable to Brussels, let alone the Government. If the Bill were eventually approved, an election could not be held until the new year.\n\nMoreover, having Brexit settled by the time of a poll would suit Jeremy Corbyn, as Labour's mixed messages would almost certainly be an impediment for the party in an early election.\n\nMuch better, so far as Mr Corbyn is concerned, to get the divisive issue out of the way so Labour can concentrate on other issues close to its heart. Passionate Labour Remainers who yearn for a second referendum would admittedly disagree.\n\nSo what will happen? Boris Johnson is by nature a gambler. His chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is not a man for half measures and favours breaking the logjam by calling an early election. It looks as though the PM agrees.\n\nBut, my God, the stakes are high. Remember that in order to get an overall majority of one, the Tories will have to win 322 seats. Labour could cobble together an anti-Brexit alliance with the SNP, and possibly the Lib Dems, having won many fewer seats.\n\nThose who believe Mr Johnson has put together an impregnable People-versus-Parliament campaign should beware of excessive optimism. He will naturally want to fight the election as much as possible on the issue of Brexit.\n\nHis opponents, though, will have other ideas. Their main focus of interest will be Boris's character \u2014 his tendency to cut corners and, so it will be said, to demonstrate an innate untrustworthiness.\n\nOur past misdeeds tend to catch up with us. Recent examples, such as the betrayal of the Democratic Unionists over customs arrangements for Northern Ireland, will also be adduced.\n\nWill Boris emerge triumphant? I obviously hope so. I think he will. His argument that Parliament is frustrating the democratic will of the people is a very powerful one.\n\nIt's going to be one hell of a battle, though.\n\nFasten your seat belts if an election is agreed in the next few days \u2014 and let's pray fortune favours the brave.", "description": "STEPHEN GLOVER: What do we ask of Boris Johnson?
