Since being credited with helping Trump earn the loyal support of the Christian right, Falwell has become a regular presence at the White House.\n\nMeanwhile, the university, founded in 1971 by his late father, the Rev Jerry Falwell Sr, has expanded exponentially. Under Falwell Jr\u2019s leadership, the Lynchburg, Virginia, not-for-profit university\u2019s assets have reportedly grown from $259m in 2007 to over $3bn and it has more than 100,000 students.\n\nBut lately, a series of alleged scandals appear to be threatening Falwell\u2019s grip on power. And this week, the stakes were raised even higher amid accusations of corruption and Falwell\u2019s own demand for an FBI investigation.\n\nRelated: Christian leader Jerry Falwell urges Trump support: 'He\u2019s a moral person'\n\nOn Monday, Politico published a report, citing more than 24 current and former \u201chigh-ranking\u201d Liberty officials, which claims they are losing confidence in him. Falwell, it alleges, \u201cpresides over a culture of self-dealing, directing university resources into projects and real estate deals in which his friends and family have stood to make personal financial gains\u201d.\n\nJim Guth, politics and international affairs professor at Furman University and an expert on the religious right, said: \u201cThere\u2019s becoming a lot of unease within the Liberty network among people in response to all of these kinds of reports that have been circulating for the last couple of years and seem to be becoming more serious, and I think that in some ways parallels what\u2019s going on in the larger evangelical community politically. And although it\u2019s remained very much supportive of Mr Falwell\u2019s favorite politician, President Trump, there seem to be increasing cracks in that approval \u2013 and I think that the same thing is happening in terms of Falwell\u2019s image within his network.\u201d\n\nConservative evangelicals\u2019 preference for \u201cstrong political leaders\u201d, he said, can make it difficult to criticize authorities, but he thinks growing pressure on Falwell could result in a leadership challenge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what to expect from this point on. I think that given the kind of developing opposition and concern on the board and elsewhere at Liberty, you may see his leadership challenged within the organization in the next few months.\u201d\n\nIn the last year, Falwell has been linked to university business deals that allegedly benefitted his personal trainer, Benjamin Crosswhite, whom he reportedly helped to buy university property. Falwell also allegedly had close dealings with Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s disgraced former personal lawyer.\n\nCohen, who is serving a three-year prison sentence, said he helped the university president deal with some racy \u201cpersonal\u201d photographs in 2015. Falwell has denied these claims.\n\nIn January, the Wall Street Journal reported that John Gauger, owner of RedFinch Solutions LLC and Liberty\u2019s chief information officer and vice-president of analytics, was hired by Cohen to try to rig online polls to favor Trump before the presidential campaign. He was also reportedly asked to create the @WomenForCohen account \u2013 which described him as a \u201cstrong, pit bull, sex symbol\u201d \u2013 to raise his profile.\n\nThe recent Politico article alleges Falwell hired his son Trey\u2019s company to manage a university-owned shopping center, loaning university money and awarding university contracts to friends. \u201cWe\u2019re not a school; we\u2019re a real estate hedge fund,\u201d one source reportedly said.\n\nThe magazine also published photos of Falwell and Trey on the dance floor of a Miami nightclub in 2014, prompting Falwell to claim that the pictures had been \u201cphotoshopped\u201d. Liberty is strict about such activities \u2013 students can reportedly be punished with \u201cdemerits\u201d for dancing with members of the opposite sex and can face expulsion for drinking.\n\nOn Tuesday Falwell issued a dramatic response to the article. He declared it an \u201cattempted coup\u201d and a \u201ccriminal\u201d smear campaign and claimed he would be asking the FBI to investigate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to dignify the lies that were reported yesterday with a response, but I am going to the authorities and I am going to civil court,\u201d he told the Associated Press, calling its reporter a \u201clittle boy\u201d.", "description": "Trump ally\u2019s political influence may be on the wane as he calls for investigation at evangelical universityDonald Trump talks with Jerry Falwell Jr during a campaign event in 2016.
