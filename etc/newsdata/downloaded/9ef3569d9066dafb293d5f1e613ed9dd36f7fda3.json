USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nA deluge of snow. Booming thunder. Rippling flags and high winds.\n\nThese extreme weather events are rarely seen at the same time \u2014 and they're even rarer in Texas during the fall. But residents of Amarillo, Texas, experienced a thunder snowstorm on Thursday, bringing early snow and a weather phenomenon to the Texas Panhandle.\n\nIn Amarillo, videos show flags rippling in the air as snow fell, with thunder roaring in the background.\n\nThe event, known as thundersnow, occurs when the upward motion of air \u2014 convection \u2014 happens during a winter storm. The effect is a thunderstorm that results in snow instead of rain.\n\nThundersnow is rare \u2014 studies show that only .07% of the snow in the United States is associated with thunder or lightning.\n\nThe timing of the storm is also out of the ordinary. Amarillo, in northern Texas, last recorded October snowfall in 2011, and as a result of this week's inclement weather, many schools were either delayed or canceled on Friday.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, the thunder snowstorm resulted in 5.5 inches of snow in Amarillo.\n\nTexas is no stranger to odd weather. From heat to tornadoes to hail, 2019 has been an eventful year for inclement natural events in the state.\n\nIn May, a massive hailstone spanning more than 5 inches fell in the state. Later that month, two separate tornadoes struck the same Texas town in the same day. And a South Texas heat wave set a record with a heat index of 128 degrees in June.\n\nY\u2019all pray for Amarillo, TX\n\n\n\nNothing wrong it\u2019s just snowing in October... pic.twitter.com/7KB5LGnbjJ \u2014 TEXAS FOREVER (@_TexasForever) October 24, 2019\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2019/10/25/texas-weather-amarillo-hit-rare-october-thundersnow/2453521001/", "description": "Amarillo, Texas, just experienced a rare first snow in October.
