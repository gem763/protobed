This included a EUR78 million impairment charge, the company said.\n\nSales for the quarter rose to EUR4.70 billion from EUR4.31 billion a year earlier, Philips said. Comparable sales grew 6%, it said.\n\nThe company said adjusted earnings before interest taxes and amortization was EUR583 million, up from EUR568 million a year before. However, adjusted Ebita margin fell to 12.4% from 13.2% in the year-earlier period.\n\nFor 2019, Philips said it continues to expect comparable sales growth of 4% to 6% and an adjusted Ebita improvement of 10 to 20 basis points.\n\nWrite to Adria Calatayud at adria.calatayudvaello@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 28, 2019 02:31 ET (06:31 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
