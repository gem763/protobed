Joe Manchin, D-W.V., announced Tuesday that he will stay in the Senate, opting not to challenge Republican West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice.\n\nManchin was recently re-elected to another six-year term in the Senate. He previously served as governor from 2005 to 2010.\n\nSEN. MANCHIN ON NEW GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION: WE\u2019VE GOT TO START WITH COMMON SENSE\n\n\u201cI have always said that \u2018public service is not self-service.\u2019 So, when considering whether to run for Governor, I couldn\u2019t focus just on which job I enjoyed the most, but on where I could be the most effective for the Mountain State,\u201d Manchin said in a statement, ending speculation about his future political plans.\n\n\u201cUltimately, I believe my role as U.S. Senator allows me to position our state for success for the rest of this century.\u201d\n\nJustice, who first ran as a Democrat and was endorsed by Manchin, is already facing multiple primary challengers amid criticism for not spending enough time in the state\u2019s capital and for allegedly being a \u201cpart-time\u201d governor.\n\nManchin has called out Justice for this in the past, saying Justice \u201cjust won\u2019t work.\u201d His statement Tuesday may have included a subtle critique as well.\n\n\u201cThose who know me know how much I loved being the Governor of West Virginia. I worked the daylights out of that job. I couldn\u2019t wait to wake up in the Governor\u2019s Mansion in the morning, and I didn\u2019t want to go to bed at night, because there was always more that I could do for our state. And that is what it takes to be an effective Governor: relentless effort,\u201d he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA recent poll has Justice leading his primary opponents, former Commerce Department Secretary Woody Thrasher and former Berkeley County delegate Mike Folk. That same poll, however, indicated that if Manchin ran, 49 percent would choose him, compared with 39 percent for Justice and 12 percent undecided.\n\nFox News' Mike Emanuel, Brooke Singman and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Sen.
