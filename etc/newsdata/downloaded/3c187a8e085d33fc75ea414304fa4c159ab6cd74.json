But, while the Singapore Budget tends to be mildly stimulatory, the size of the expected boost has eased.\n\n\u201cThis macroeconomic policy mix is assessed to be appropriate given current economic conditions,\u201d the central bank said in its latest biannual report, while re-affirming that, \u201cshould the outlook for inflation and growth weaken significantly, MAS is prepared to recalibrate monetary policy\u201d.\n\nBy stressing ongoing conditions, the MAS tacitly gazes closer into the crystal ball than it did in April, when policies were tipped to ensure \u201cprice stability and sustainable growth in the medium term\u201d.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nThe fresh, nearer-term assessment comes just weeks after the MAS pulled back on the pace of appreciation of the Singapore dollar in its first monetary loosening in three years.\n\nStay updated with\n\nBT newsletters Terms & conditions Sign up\n\nSingapore\u2019s fiscal impulse, which measures how short-term government spending affects the economy, has been pegged at about 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) for the year.\n\nThat figure still \u201cimplies a slightly more expansionary fiscal policy stance\u201d than in 2018, but is lower than the estimate of 0.7 per cent in the April macroeconomic review.\n\nThat's even as, over the same period, the forecast for full-year GDP growth has been slashed to zero to 1 per cent - down from the range from 1.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent projected in April.\n\nThis year\u2019s expansionary fiscal impulse - which means that the government has taken out less revenue than it is spending, against the year before - follows initiatives from a \u201clonger\u2010term sustainable growth\u201d Budget that the MAS noted were meant to raise productivity and tackle social inequality.\n\nSince then, though, the output gap \u201chas turned slightly negative\u201d, as the MAS noted in its monetary policy statement earlier in October.\n\nThe output gap, which is expressed as a share of GDP, refers to the difference between the actual GDP and the level of economic activity that can be supported without leading to unhealthy inflation pressure.\n\nIn other words, the negative output gap points to an economy that is performing below its full potential. And the central bank expects the negative output gap to persist - weakening from a projected -0.46 per cent of potential GDP in 2019 to -0.66 per cent in 2020.\n\n\u201cWhile a slowdown in Singapore\u2019s trade\u2010related sectors was anticipated, the extent of the downshift in activity in the last six months turned out to be more severe than previously envisaged,\u201d the MAS noted in its October macroeconomic review report.\n\nBy and large, private-sector economy watchers have been keeping an eye on what support the upcoming Budget 2020 package could offer the ailing economy.\n\nDBS senior economist Irvin Seah wrote in August, when the full-year outlook was officially downgraded: \u201cThe government can afford to keep its powder dry and be more calibrated on the policy front at the moment. The key is to be prepared should the situation deteriorates sharply.\u201d\n\nSuch a view was further cemented by MAS managing director Ravi Menon\u2019s remarks to Bloomberg last week that \u201cit can't be that every slowdown, every risk or threat on the horizon has to be addressed by a loosening of monetary policy\u201d, as fiscal measures also have a role.\n\nIndeed, according to historical data, the small estimated fiscal impulse for 2019 is a fraction of the last peak, clocked during the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, when the government pushed through a S$20.5 billion Resilience Package to jumpstart the economy.\n\nSeparately, besides monetary easing, some countries are already turning to fiscal stimulus to prop up growth, amid fears of a wider contagion from trade and manufacturing weakness, the MAS also noted.\n\nSuch fiscal measures include plans for climate change\u2010related spending in Germany, infrastructure investment in the Netherlands, a rebate on electronic goods in Japan, corporate tax cuts in India, and tax incentives for businesses and households in China.\n\nDespite the turn to expansionary macroeconomic policy in economies elsewhere, the MAS has warned that \u201cconstraints such as policy space, debt sustainability and financial stability concerns could cap the stimulus to these economies\u201d.\n\nStill, key differences between Singapore and other economies involve the central bank's use of the Singdollar exchange rate, rather than interest rates, in monetary policy, as well as its fiscal headroom in terms of its low debt constraints, ample reserves, and surpluses from previous national Budgets.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - SINGAPORE\u2019S recently loosened monetary policy, and its fiscal policy, taken together, are \u201cappropriate given current economic conditions\u201d, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) reiterated - giving a more short-term opinion than was stated earlier in the year. .
