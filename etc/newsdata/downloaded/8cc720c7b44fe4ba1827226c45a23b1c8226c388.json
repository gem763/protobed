Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nD.C. United Coach Ben Olsen surprised opponents and fans alike two weekends ago in Montreal when he decided to start Russell Canouse at right back, a position he last played in 2016 on another continent.\n\nCanouse was there again in the second half of the friendly against Puebla last week at Buzzard Point. And following the team\u2019s weekend off, the tried-and-true defensive midfielder appears to be Olsen\u2019s first choice to start on the back line in Portland on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI prefer central midfield, but I\u2019m willing to adjust to help the team any way I can,\u201d Canouse said Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019ll take it and run with it.\u201d\n\n[In 16 U.S. soccer players find a home in Switzerland \u2014 and in the Champions League]\n\nThe other primary option is Leonardo Jara, a starter most of the year. But with just a month left in the regular season, Olsen wants to get Canouse back into game rhythm, even if that means playing him out of position.\n\nLeading to the Montreal match, Canouse was returning from a collapsed lung that had cost him five games. In his absence, though, Junior Moreno and Felipe Martins formed a strong bond in defensive midfield.\n\nSo Canouse landed in the back, where he played twice in 2016 for Bochum in Germany\u2019s second division.\n\n\u201cI was just happy to get an opportunity to play a full shift,\u201d he said of rejoining D.C.'s starting lineup. \u201cI understand the tactical awareness that goes with the position, I felt I could go in and do the job and do it well.\u201d\n\nCanouse did perform well against Montreal during the 3-0 victory.\n\n\u201cI have to be a little more patient,\u201d he said of the new position. \u201cIn midfield, I am able to control the game more. I can try to push the game the way I want to. At outside back, I have to almost accept what comes to me.\u201d\n\n>> Rooney, Kamara or both?: Ola Kamara scored twice against Montreal, but captain Wayne Rooney is back in the mix after a two-game, red-card suspension.\n\nSo how will Olsen handle the two proven forwards in what has been a one-striker formation? Furthermore, who will orchestrate the attack, Paul Arriola or Luciano Acosta?\n\nOlsen will not reveal anything until game time in Portland.\n\n\u201cOla, since he has come, has been sharp,\u201d Olsen said of the Norwegian striker, who signed last month. \u201cPaul has been really sharp in that [playmaking] spot and allows us to do some different things from a [defensive] pressing standpoint. There\u2019s Lucho and Wayne. There\u2019s a lot of tough choices out there.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine Rooney coming off the bench, so in all likelihood, Olsen will start both him and Kamara, perhaps with Rooney as a withdrawn forward. As for Acosta, who slipped out of favor late in the summer, a continuing role as a substitute seems in store.\n\nAfter United acquired three players late in the summer transfer window, Olsen had warned he would need time to identify his best lineup and formation. With the home stretch arriving, Olsen said he has \u201ca pretty good idea who we are going to be the rest of the year and how we are going to go about being successful.\n\n\u201cIt starts with being hard to beat and defensively sound and hard to play against. That has to be the foundation for us to have success the next four games and beyond. We\u2019ve got some talented players, we have some guys who can make plays, but to me it starts with defensive effort.\u201d\n\n>> International duty: Moreno is with the Venezuelan national team for Tuesday\u2019s friendly against Colombia in Tampa. He is scheduled to rejoin United on Wednesday and travel with the team to Portland on Friday.\n\n>> U-23 assignment: Rookie center back Donovan Pines played the last 29 minutes and had a goal disallowed in the U.S. under-23 national team\u2019s 2-0 victory over Japan in a closed-door exhibition in Chula Vista, Calif. The squad is preparing for Olympic qualifying in January. Pines will rejoin United on Wednesday.\n\n>> Asad\u2019s status: Argentine attacker Yamil Asad, whom United reacquired last week for the 2020 season, is awaiting approval of a work visa before being able to play for second-division Loudoun United. He signed a short-term contract with the Leesburg-based USL team, which has nine matches left, starting Friday against visiting Memphis.\n\nUnited has yet to formally announce Asad\u2019s deals.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe day before an international match, a goalie from Cura\u00e7ao died of a heart attack\n\nThe soccer simulation game Football Manager is getting its players to rethink Brexit\n\nThe U.S.-Mexico soccer rivalry endures, even with more reps and lower stakes", "description": "The natural defensive midfielder is adjusting to a recent move to the back line, where her appears set to start again Sunday in Portland.", "authors": ["Steven Goff", "Reporter Covering Soccer", "D.C.
