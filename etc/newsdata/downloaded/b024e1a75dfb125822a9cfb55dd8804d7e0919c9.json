They will think there is something wrong with them.\n\n\u2018We are not against sex education, but we need to show how damaging porn is. We are coming at this from a safeguarding point of view.\u2019\n\nSet up in 2012, Respect Yourself contained information about puberty, STIs and sexual desire, along with an anonymous Q&A section where visitors can seek advice.\n\nIn one question, a 12-year-old girl says she has a crush on her female music teacher and can\u2019t sleep because she is addicted to masturbating and watching porn at night.\n\nThe responder replies: \u2018What you are going through is perfectly natural for a girl your age. For some reason, we have the idea that only boys get turned on, masturbate or watch porn. That is nonsense.\u2019\n\nParents are concerned with the advice being given out Warwickshire Council\u2019s Respect Yourself website (Picture: Safe Schools Alliance/ Click Off)\n\nChildren as young as 12 are writing into the website for advice (Picture: Safe Schools Alliance / Click Off)\n\nIn another section, the website advises teens not to be embarrassed about porn and masturbation because most people \u2018have a fiddle now and then\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe responder writes: \u2018You may have seen there\u2019s been quite a lot in the media recently about the dangers and harms that porn causes to young people. Many people have been quite vocal and do truly believe that porn is dangerous for young people to watch.\n\n\u2018However, there are no scientific studies that give evidence to suggest that watching porn is any more likely to turn you into a sex addict than watching a violent film is likely to turn you into a serial killer. In fact there is more evidence to suggest the opposite.\n\n\u2018It is perfectly natural to be curious and get horny and want to watch something that turns you on. That said, be aware \u2013 porn is not real life \u2013 no more than Grand Theft Auto is real life. Some people make that mistake \u2013 it is a fantasy so bear that in mind.\u2019\n\nCampaigners say the website doesn\u2019t make teenagers aware of the harmful effects of porn (Picture: Safe Schools Alliance / Click Off)\n\nParents have criticised the advise given to a girl who said she couldn\u2019t sleep because she was addicted to masturbating (Picture: Safe Schools Alliance / Click Off)\n\nRespect Yourself was taken down after Metro.co.uk contacted Warwickshire County Council for comment and is currently under \u2018review\u2019.\n\nBut campaigners who started a petition against the website say they still want answers over how some of the content came to be published.\n\nSSA and Click Off say while the \u2018Sextionary\u2019 section described some sex acts as painful, it failed to address the fact young women usually experience it as \u2018risky and coercive\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey said it was inaccurate to suggest watching too much porn is not linked to harmful sexual behaviour, citing studies which show men who watch it are more likely to commit sex offences and women who watch it are more likely to accept rape \u2018as a myth.\u2019\n\nCampaigners said descriptions on the website were graphic and unnecessary (Picture: respectyourself.info)\n\nIn a joint statement, the groups said: \u2018In failing to condemn the use of pornography the Respect Yourself guidance is effectively sacrificing the best interests of women and girls in order to seem \u2018sex positive.\u2019\n\n\u2018The poorly reasoned approach of Respect Yourself will undoubtedly prevent many adolescents in Warwickshire from enjoying healthy, mutually enjoyable sexual relationships in adulthood.\u2019\n\nThey are urging parents to continue signing their petition until Warwickshire Council address their concerns.\n\nA spokesperson for the local authority told Metro.co.uk: \u2018The Council carefully considers all comments raised about our services.\n\n\u2018We have decided to review the content of a few of our pages which have raised a small number of concerns.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
