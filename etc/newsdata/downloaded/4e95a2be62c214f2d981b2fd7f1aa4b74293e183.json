There will be a visit to 10 Downing Street, a blizzard of honours and garlands and awards, a bonus pool of \u00a32.5 million to be dished out. When Sean Fitzpatrick won the 1987 World Cup with New Zealand, meanwhile, the celebrations were a little more restrained.\n\n\u201cI went back to work on the building site on the Monday,\u201d he says. \u201cIn those days, that was your job. Win the World Cup, and then go back to work.\u201d\n\nIt was a different time, of course: almost a different world. When the inaugural World Cup was first proposed, there were no guarantees of success. The Home Nations were staunchly opposed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we understood what the World Cup was about then,\u201d Fitzpatrick says. \u201cI don\u2019t think there were too many sponsors. The Northern Hemisphere didn\u2019t really want it. Now it\u2019s just turned into this amazing tournament. Every World Cup\u2019s got better and better.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The expectation on New Zealand to conquer all before them is as resounding and as uncompromising as it ever was. And as a veteran of three World Cups, and now a respected broadcaster and pundit, Fitzpatrick understands why their semi-final defeat to England last Saturday will have created such shockwaves, even if he stops short of describing it as a crisis.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see that performance coming,\u201d he admits. \u201cEveryone\u2019s hurting, and the All Blacks more so than anyone. They just couldn\u2019t get into the game. I was happy when it was only 10-0 at half-time. Considering the way the game was going, it could have been 30 or 40 points. That\u2019s how dominant England were.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. England vs New Zealand in 100 brilliant pictures Show all 100 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

That\u2019s the great thing about the All Blacks. They\u2019ll go away, they\u2019ll be hard on themselves. But they\u2019ll have to put that aside as a bad day at the office. We\u2019ve got the talent. They\u2019re still world-class players. Losing one game, it\u2019s not going to define us.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, the All Blacks are now reaping the consequences of their own excellence. Having raised the bar for everyone else, teams have finally managed to match their standards, and for Fitzpatrick \u2013 who has always taken a global rather than a parochial view on the game \u2013 it\u2019s made 2019 the greatest tournament he can remember.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve loved about this World Cup,\u201d he says. \u201cWe came to the quarter-finals and literally any one of those teams could have gone the whole way. Even Japan, who I don\u2019t think anyone truly expected to be that competitive, but who have just set the tournament on fire. That\u2019s what people want to see.\n\n\u201cIn terms of Uruguay and Namibia, you\u2019ve really seen the influence of World Rugby putting some money into them. What they need is to play the top teams more often. Let\u2019s not just say: \u2018Thanks for coming to the party, see you in four years\u2019 time\u2019. The global game is so important. We need to not just think about ourselves.\u201d\n\nAnd at the end of a gruelling, gripping tournament, an intriguing final that Fitzpatrick is far too wise to call one way or the other. Where he can offer an insight is what goes through the minds of a team in the build-up to the biggest game of their lives. How do you prepare? How do you cope with the pressure? How do you raise your game again after \u2013 in England\u2019s case \u2013 a cataclysmic, life-changing semi-final?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting, I was speaking to Sir Clive [Woodward] about it yesterday,\u201d Fitzpatrick says. \u201cIn 1995, we completely dominated England in the semi-final, and then six days later [in the final against South Africa] we didn\u2019t perform. There\u2019s been lots of World Cups where that\u2019s happened. France in \u201887. The All Blacks in \u201995. France again in \u201999. The coaches and the staff have got a lot of work to do to make sure the guys are prepared.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to back up that performance. Especially after everyone expected the All Blacks to win. Now it\u2019s flipped on its head, and everyone\u2019s expecting England to win. How they deal with that expectation, how they embrace it, will be interesting to see. They\u2019ve just got to go about their normal routines. Make sure all the players know exactly how the game\u2019s going to be played.\u201d\n\nA couple of days before the 1995 final at Johannesburg, disaster struck the All Blacks camp when most of the squad went down with food poisoning. After a meek and depleted New Zealand lost the final 15-12 in extra time, all sorts of elaborate conspiracy theories rose to the surface. Claims of sabotage were manifold but never conclusively proven. The finger of blame was pointed at a mysterious waitress called \u201cSuzie\u201d. A quarter of a century on, Fitzpatrick is none the wiser.\n\n\u201cWe never found her,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat happened? I don\u2019t know. All I know is we definitely had food poisoning. I think it was the tea. But it\u2019s old news. There\u2019s a good book by Peter Fitzsimmons that tells you everything you need to know. You should read it.\u201d\n\nNefarious poisonings aside, Fitzpatrick reckons that this year\u2019s final will be an attritional affair. \u201cI don\u2019t see South Africa playing the game any differently to the last month or so,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve shown the way they want to play: shutting it down, kicking a lot. That can work.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, he\u2019s been extremely impressed by Eddie Jones\u2019s men. \u201cEngland can play a multifaceted game,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve redefined their game, in terms of their running, the way their props play. That\u2019s not traditionally the way England plays. Their three knockout games will be against Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. If they can win all three, they\u2019ll be deserved world champions.\u201d\n\nTime, then, for this decorated World Cup-winning captain to stick his neck out. \u201cIt could go either way,\u201d he reckons. \u201cIt could come down to a kick in the last minute of the game. England have got an opportunity. They\u2019ve got the players. I suspect they\u2019ll be favourites. But then, I said the All Blacks would win on Saturday\u2026\u201d\n\nSean Fitzpatrick was joined by Laureus Ambassadors Nolli Waterman and Ai Sugiyama on Monday at a special visit that united two Laureus programmes through the power of rugby.
