This week the women\u2019s minister, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, said more than 30 women were killed by their spouses last month.\n\nProtesters are planning a national shutdown of the country on Friday and are calling for a state of emergency to be declared.\n\nThousands of people, including local celebrities, have taken to social media to express their anger and frustrations at the killings under the hashtags #NotInMyName #AmINext and #SAShutDown.\n\nOn Thursday, young and old took to the streets, women wearing chains, a symbol of how the violence has repressed South African women. Many carried placards reading: \u201cEnough is enough\u201d, \u201cMy body is not your crime scene\u201d and pleading with the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, to act against the violence perpetrated against women and children.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, addresses protesters outside parliament in Cape Town.

Violence against women, children and the LGBTIQ+ is a crisis.\n\n\u201cI am addressing the female ministers. When are you going to hold these men accountable who have been failing us for so long?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this government fails to protect us, we, as the women of South Africa, will take them to the constitutional court,\u201d Evans yelled as the crowd cheered.\n\nIn an impromptu address to the protesters, Ramaphosa admitted that it was time his government took emergency measures to deal with the scourge of rape and the murder of women. \u201cEnough is enough and we are going to act,\u201d said Ramaphosa, promising to announce later on Thursday a raft of measures.\n\n\u201cMen that kill and rape must stay in jail for life. The law must change that once you have raped and kill you get life, no bail,\u201d Ramaphosa told the angry crowd.\n\nThe first of last month\u2019s victims to make national headlines was Saadiqa Newman, a 26-year-old mother-to-be who was shot eight times by gangsters. Denusha Witbooi was then murdered in her vehicle by unknown gunmen, while equestrian rider Meghan Cremer was found murdered, tied up and dumped in a sand mine.\n\nSix-year-old Nathlia Pienaar died after she was struck in the head by a bullet while skipping with a rope just outside her home. Lynetter Volschenk was found chopped up in her apartment in a gruesome crime committed by a neighbour, and the South African boxing champion, Leighandre Jegels, was shot dead by her police officer boyfriend.\n\nThe last straw for many was when the body of 19-year-old missing University of Cape Town student, Uyinene Mrwetyana, was discovered. She disappeared on 24 August on her way to collect a parcel at the local post office.\n\nA post office employee has confessed in court to raping and beating her to death with a set of scales inside the post office, which is situated next door to a police station.", "description": "President promises to do more after the most deadly month for violent crimes against women country has ever seen", "authors": ["Robin-Lee Francke"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b22f8c0f4ebd19eec3b9423a0d666267d06b2146/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ee30d747a94da0aff0ff857970c289bf", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
