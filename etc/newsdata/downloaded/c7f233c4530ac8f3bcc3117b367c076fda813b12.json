We're taking a different approach,\" Mr Taylor said.\n\nIn a separate report by the Washington-based global economic institution, it also appeared to demur from the Morrison government's push for business to stick to its knitting of traditional business and economic matters and not waste time so-called \"virtue signalling\" on social issues.\n\n\"Environmental, social, and governance issues can have a material impact on firms\u2019 performance and on the stability of the financial system more broadly,\" the IMF says.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison last week criticised unaccountable global institutions for trying to impose rules on Australia's sovereignty.\n\nMeanwhile, the then head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Martin Parkinson warned in July that Australians will continue to suffer high power prices because of the failure to impose an economy-wide carbon price on emissions.\n\n\"Until we have a sensible set of policies that can be sustained in the long run, then we will have prices above what we need to have,\" he said.\n\nDr Parkinson, an economist who has been involved in energy and climate policy since the Howard government's preparations for an emissions trading scheme (ETS) in 2007, said an \"explicit price on carbon\" through an emissions trading scheme would be cheaper than other mechanisms like the current Renewable Energy Target.", "description": "A rising carbon tax to $US75 a tonne would still not be enough for Australia to meet its Paris emissions reduction target, the International Monetary Fund says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/57ed5f1b4d6db61e05b455b7dda783759acfdbf6", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
