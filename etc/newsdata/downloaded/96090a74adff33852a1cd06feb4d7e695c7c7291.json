But the pace of new revelations, like Trump openly calling for China to collude with him, is testing that strategy, and prompting some progressives to wonder if it\u2019s a mistake to ignore Trump\u2019s interactions with other foreign leaders.\n\nWith the inquiry not even two weeks old, and reluctantly undertaken by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), many House Democrats worry that an expansive focus will distract from the straightforward account, presented in a whistleblower complaint and confirmed by a call summary released by the White House, that Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate political rival Biden.\n\nMost lawmakers have backed up Pelosi\u2019s keep-it-simple strategy. \u201cI think we should be focused, not overthink this,\u201d said Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) last Thursday. \u201cRight now, people understand what he did.\u201d\n\nAnd staffers for members around the Democratic caucus indicated support for a narrow inquiry focused on Ukraine. \u201cArguably, the stronger case you have to send to the Senate is what you want,\u201d said one Democratic aide, \u201cbut they\u2019re already so slow moving on one topic, so to add in more\u2026 I think there could be enough with Ukraine to do what needs to get done.\u201d\n\nThat calculus grates on some progressives, even if they may be outliers on the Hill. One congressional aide said it was \u201cmalpractice\u201d for the Democrats to keep a narrow impeachment focus, as Trump is \u201cblatantly using our country\u2019s foreign policy as a tool for his own domestic political benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the particular case that triggered the impeachment inquiry, it was Trump pressuring the Ukrainian president to help gin up something against Biden, but we know he\u2019s brought this kind of pressure before,\u201d the aide continued. \u201cIn the case of pressuring [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu to ban two members of Congress, he did it right out in the open. So it would frankly be malpractice for Congress not to seek records of other calls to determine what pressure may have been brought to bear by Trump against other foreign leaders to achieve political and possibly financial benefits for himself.\u201d\n\nA Senate Democratic staffer agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why House Democrats would limit themselves to Ukraine given that the president laid out his own blueprint for what Democrats should investigate. Just today it\u2019s China, but now his attorney general is pressing U.S. allies like the Five Eyes [surveillance] alliance to work on behalf of his political agenda undermining the Mueller Report.\u201d\n\nThe staffer said Senate Democrats weren\u2019t much better: \u201cI don\u2019t think Senate Democrats have been particularly brave or outspoken for a broad impeachment inquiry, either.\u201d\n\nNeither the news cycle nor the president is cooperating with the Ukraine-centric strategy, which may stretch current Democratic patience. New revelations that the president pressed foreigners to aid him in discrediting his domestic political opponents accumulate almost daily. This week alone, they\u2019ve expanded to include Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Then, on Thursday morning, Trump openly said that \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d something Biden campaign aide Kate Bedingfield likened to Trump\u2019s 2016 call for Russia to steal Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\nAll that is eclipsing behavior that earlier in Trump\u2019s presidency was seen as abuses of power, such as a foreign government reportedly booking multiple rooms in Trump hotels for a single guest or aiding the rehabilitation of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after the CIA assessed him as responsible for murdering journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nThe recent revelations have raised questions about how standard it is for Trump to solicit personal favors while ostensibly conducting presidential business. And before the Ukraine revelations emerged, several House Democrats wanted Trump impeached for using his office to enrich himself, a violation of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause.\n\nA congressional source said the House Foreign Affairs Committee intends to stay focused on Ukraine at present but didn\u2019t rule out expansion in the future. A representative for the House Intelligence Committee declined to comment, and those from the House Oversight Committee didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nYet by Wednesday, the two committees took a step to expand the probe. Listed among materials the committee chairs plan to subpoena from the White House are communications between Trump \u201cand the leader of any other foreign country\u201d relevant to \u201cpursuing investigations of President Trump\u2019s political rivals and Ukrainian foreign aid.\u201d Asked if the inquiry would expand to scrutinize conversations with other foreign leaders, a congressional source said \u201cit may be trending in that direction,\u201d as each of the \u201cnew stories hit all the same notes.\u201d\n\nPresidential communications with foreign counterparts are typically considered privileged and beyond the scope of Congress. The subpoena, which Democratic leadership anticipates formally issuing Friday, already tests that and is likely to lead to litigation in order to enforce it. That outcome is uncertain enough before any potential expansion into non-Ukraine communications.\n\nScott Cullinane, a former staffer on the foreign affairs committee, warned that going after Trump\u2019s other communications with foreign leaders risked setting precedents that would come back to haunt both Democratic and Republican presidents.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Branch has a legitimate need for confidential conversations as a part of effective American diplomacy. Congress has an oversight responsibility, but overreaching has consequences that will outlast any one administration,\u201d Cullinane said. \u201cIt could affect how any future president conducts foreign policy and change how foreign leaders share information with the U.S. government.\u201d\n\nAnd any effort to expand the scope of the impeachment probe, however incremental, is likely to meet stiff resistance among the dozens of House Democrats, largely from swing districts, who recently came out in favor of an impeachment inquiry and are bracing for its political impact.\n\nThough they acknowledge additional findings could be explosive, these Democrats worry about a drawn-out effort to obtain records of more Trump calls\u2014which would probably be decided through the courts\u2014extending into next year and snarling the prospects for bills they\u2019re holding out hope to pass on health care and infrastructure. Pelosi is clearly proceeding with their concerns top of mind, and her team is taking pains to hear out moderates worried about impeachment becoming a 2020 liability.\n\nAt a town hall on Wednesday night, Rep. Susan Wild (D-PA), who was an impeachment holdout before the Ukraine allegations broke, argued Democrats should keep the inquiry limited\u2014a view echoed by many of her colleagues who also flipped GOP-held districts in 2018.\n\n\u201cI have an interest in keeping it as narrow as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to be another Benghazi.\u201d\n\n\u2014Erin Banco contributed reporting", "description": "Most House Democrats want the impeachment probe aimed squarely at Ukraine\u2014but some progressives are starting to question that strategy.", "authors": ["Spencer Ackerman", "Sam Brodey", "Senior Nat L Security Correspondent", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570164535/191003-Ackerman-Brodey-Trump-tease_pwnzdx", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
