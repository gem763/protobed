The 42-year-old Brady told reporters that the young receivers are trying their best to help the team win. \u201cThey\u2019re young. I was young; I was trying once, too. I just didn\u2019t have to play my first year, so it\u2019s a little different,\u201d said Brady.\n\nAs part of their job, Brady said it\u2019s the duty of young wideouts to learn the team\u2019s playbook, absorb knowledge from the coaches and always be on their designated spots all the time. Aside from Meyers and Olszewski, the Patriots also have veterans Julian Edelman, Josh Gordon, Phillip Dorsett and special teamer Matthew Slater as wide receivers. Rookie wideout N\u2019Keal Harry, the Patriots\u2019 first-round pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, is scheduled to return from injury in Week 9.\n\nPatriots\u2019 receiving corps under scrutiny\n\nThe Patriots\u2019 receiving corps is under intense scrutiny since the departure of talented receiver Antonio Brown and Brady\u2019s less-than-stellar performance in their 16-10 win over the Buffalo Bills in Week 4. Brady completed just 18 of 39 passes for 150 yards and an interception against the Bills, but the Patriots (4-0) emerged unscathed with the help of their outstanding defense.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

NFL New England Patriots\n\nHowever, the Patriots are well aware that the lack of depth at wide receiver could derail their march towards a seventh Super Bowl trophy. The Patriots created a huge splash when they signed Brown to a one-year, $15 million deal. The signing further solidified the Patriots\u2019 status as a favorite to win the Super Bowl. However, things did not go as planned as Brown was released after 11 days due to his off-field legal troubles.\n\nThe release also inflicted a $5 million hit on the Patriots\u2019 salary cap room, restricting them from signing or trading for another big-name wide receiver. There were reports that the Patriots are eyeing to acquire the services of either Stefon Diggs of the Minnesota Vikings, Emmanuel Sanders of the Denver Broncos and A.J. Green of the Cincinnati Bengals before the Oct. 29 trade deadline.\n\nPatriots could turn their focus on Sanders\n\nWhile the Vikings declared that they will not trade Diggs because he can be an asset in their playoff push, the Bengals and the Broncos are open to trading Green and Sanders.\n\nAccording to NFL insider Jay Glazer of Fox Sports, he will not be surprised if the Patriots pursue a trade for Sanders. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t shock me,\u201d said Glazer, saying the Patriots have a history of signing big-name receivers in the past years.\n\nLast year, Glazer said the Patriots tried to trade for Randall Cobb but were rebuffed. \u201cObviously, they\u2019re looking for another receiver there, which is why they brought in Antonio Brown.\n\nSo, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d said Glazer. In 2013, the Patriots signed Sanders to an offer sheet while he was in Pittsburgh, but the Steelers matched it.\n\nAccording to Phil Perry and Tom E. Curran of NBC Sports, Sanders is more affordable via trade compared to Diggs with just $13 million in salary cap hit in the final year of his deal. The Patriots could make several roster moves to create space in their current salary cap, but it would affect their ability to add quality players in the near future.", "description": "The Patriots signed Sanders to an offer sheet while he was in Pittsburgh in 2013 but it was matched by Steelers.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Oliver Vandervoort", "Zeegee Cecilio", "Read More On The Same Topic Zeegee Cecilio", "Julian Edelman Downplays Patriots", "Trade Rumors", "Tom Brady Praises Offensive Line", "Analyst Mike Florio Claims That Patriots' Tom Brady Could Be Traded For Right Package", "Redskins Qb Dwayne Haskins Sees Tom Brady As Role Model", "Wants To Share Field With Him"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/5/os/b_1200x630/sanders-has-23-catches-for-298-yards-and-2-scores-this-season-image-credit-denver-broncosyoutube_2334395.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
