A third poll showed the parties tied.\n\nThe exit polls, which have been wrong in the the past, suggested that neither Mr Gantz nor Mr Netanyahu had a clear path to forming a majority coalition government, which likely means weeks of post-election negotiations before a final result is clear.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from either Likud or Blue & White and both sides appeared to be waiting for more complete results before making statements on victory or defeat.\n\nBut if the results held, it would be a remarkable set back for Mr Netanyahu, who is Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister and has held power continuously for more than a decade through a string of clear election victories.\n\nOne figure who may play a kingmaker role in coalition negotiations is Avigdor Lieberman, Mr Netanyahu\u2019s former defence minister who turned against angrily against his former boss after the last election in April.\n\nDespite hailing the political Right, Mr Lieberman refused to join Mr Netanyahu\u2019s coalition and denied the prime minister a majority. Mr Netanyahu then called an unprecedented second election.\n\nThe exit polls suggested Mr Lieberman's small secular nationalist party, Yisrael Beiteinu, had improved its standing and could now hold the balance of power in coalition negotiations.\n\nMr Lieberman has been coy about his intentions but has hinted that he might back Mr Gantz, a secular liberal. Both men have spoken about the need to counter the influence of Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties and of forcing Mr Netanyahu from office.\n\nAvigdor Lieberman could be a major player in post-election negotiations Credit: AP Photo/Markus Schreiber, File More\n\nThe first stage of the post-election negotiations will be for Israel's president, Reuven Rivlin, to survey party leaders in the divided parliament and assess whether Mr Gantz or Mr Netanyahu has more support.\n\nMr Lieberman\u2019s backing is likely to be crucial as both men try to convince the president they have the best chance of forming a majority government.\n\nThe process of trying to cobble together a coalition could take weeks and analysts could not rule out the possibility of a third election if neither side is able to get a majority.\n\nBoth Blue and White and Likud won 35 seats in the last election in April. When Mr Netanyahu was unable to form a majority government he called an unprecedented second election to try win an overall majority.\n\nIf Mr Netanyahu is unable to cobble together a coalition this time, he faces the possible risk of a mutiny within his own Likud party. Senior Likud figures have so far insisted they will not rise up against their leader.\n\n\u201cIt will never happen. We are totally against anybody telling the Likud who to vote for,\u201d Nir Barkat, a senior Likud MP, told The Telegraph.\n\nBut Blue & White believes Likud officials could eventually overthrow Mr Netanyahu if they believe he has become a drag on the party\u2019s prospects of holding onto power.", "description": "Israel was holding its breath on Tuesday after early election exit polls suggested Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s centrist rivals had won more seats in parliament, potentially endangering the prime minister\u2019s 13 years in power.\u00a0 While no final results were available, two out of three early exit polls indicated", "authors": ["Raf Sanchez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nRjCtOB8DOZJAU5NrATAfw--~B/aD0xMDA4O3c9MTYxMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/0350b868c3caef2615333138f79a44d2", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
