It's a massive challenge,\" she said.\n\nThe winners in each category will be announced at a glitzy ceremony at London's Grosvenor House hotel in front of a star-studded crowd of guests.\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn/Daily Mirror)\n\nDescribing the uniqueness of the occasion, Susanna said: \"All the people who think they are stars are sat in the audience and the real stars go up on stage. The real people, the real heroes, children who've shown extraordinary courage, emergency services who've gone above and beyond and people who have raised extraordinary amounts for charity, they get to meet the people they like on screen and their heroes - but we get the opportunity to acknowledge who the real stars are.\"\n\nAs the ceremony marks its milestone twentieth year, Susanna said the Pride of Britain remains as popular as ever.\n\n\"It's such a difficult time at the minute because we are so divided. We've seen politically there's a massive split and there's massive hostility and its difficult and tense times.\n\n\"And what's really lovely is that we can forget all that for a night and feel united which is what we absolutely need to do,\" she said.\n\nCaroline Vorderman, who has hosted the show since it started in 1999, called Pride of Britain the 'mothership' of 'hero' awards.\n\n\"This year is going to be a celebration of 20 years,\" she promised about the upcoming ceremony.\n\n\"And what's interesting is we still struggle to find the winners and the list is so strong. It genuinely is. In past years there's been one stand out person in a category to select but this year it's really tough.\"\n\n\"It's a privilege to host it. It wasn't even televised the first time,\" she added. \"[Which] feels like three weeks ago last Thursday to me!\"\n\nDiscussing the secret to the show's continued popularity, Caroline said: \"There's an inherent part of all of us that values goodness no matter what might be in the media and what might be in the news, it's in there somewhere. It's part of our humanity and that's what makes it enduring.\"\n\nThis Morning's Eamonn Holmes said choosing the winners was going to be 'absolutely daunting'.\n\n\"These people are superhuman at times and you have to ask yourself, 'Could I have done the same thing? Would I have done that?'\n\n\"There are so many tremendous people out there. As country with the aftermath of Brexit and the vote the whole country feels quite divided, but here we have people that do selfless things for other people and they do the good thing.\n\nHe added: \"It's wonderful to salute people who don't often get that salute.\"\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn/Daily Mirror)\n\nAhead of the judging, Christine Lampard said she'd read the briefs several times and still couldn't pick a winner.\n\n\"It's very important to get it right. we say it every year but this year the stories are so compelling.\n\n\"This year was particularly difficult I have to say, but I'm very privileged to be part of the judging panel,\" she added.\n\nThe Pride of Britain Awards will air Tuesday 5th November on ITV at 8pm", "description": "Exclusive: Ahead of next week's Pride of Briton Awards, Mirror Online caught up with members of the judging panel as they sat down to decide the winners", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Philip Coburn Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20691562.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Pride-of-Britain.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
