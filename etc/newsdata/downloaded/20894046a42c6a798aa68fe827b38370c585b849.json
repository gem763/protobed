Biles' U.S. teammate Jade Carey took the silver on 14.883, with Ellie Downie of Britain third on 14.816.\n\nThat takes Biles to 23 career world championship medals, equaling the mark set by Belarusian Vitaly Scherbo for any gymnast, male or female.\n\nA year after becoming the Philippines' first gymnast to win a medal, Carlos Yulo became his country's first world champion with victory in the men's floor exercise.\n\nLast year's bronze medalist, Yulo performed the most difficult routine of any of the eight finalists to score 15.3 and beat Israel's Artem Dolgopyat by one-tenth of a point. Xiao Ruoteng of China took bronze with 14.933.\n\n___\n\nGold medalist Simone Biles of the United States performs on the vault in the women's apparatus finals at the Gymnastics World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany, Saturday, Oct. 12, 2019.
