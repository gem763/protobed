They credit their success to great value.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cNine-and-a-half years later, we have over 2000 employees,\u201d Gilboa said. \"We have over 100 stores. And I think more than anything, we've just focused on delivering great value to customers. So taking a product that normally costs a few hundred dollars and offering it starting at $95, including prescription lenses and trying to make the purchase process as easy as possible, whether people want to order online or in one of our stores.\u201d\n\nGilboa said they started Warby Parker because they took a look at the eyewear industry and couldn't find a reason that justified high pricing. They decided to sell directly to the consumer through an online shop as well as stores, cutting out a great deal of the middlemen.\n\nWarby Parker has an optical lab outside of New York City but produces its lenses in Italy, Japan and China. Gilboa said because of that, their business has been affected by China tariffs.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cSome of our suppliers are in China, and so the tariffs are impacting us,\u201d Gilboa said. \u201cAnd we're having conversations with our suppliers and thinking about what our supply chains should look like strategically over the next few years.\u201d\n\nWarby Parker co-founder Neil Blumenthal said moving production to the U.S. is not something the company can do quickly.\n\n\u201cThe entire optical industry is very dependent on China and all the component pieces,\u201d Warby Parker co-founder Neil Blumenthal said. \u201cSo it's not just the final assembly, but the core wire, the hinges, the screws, the raw materials.\"", "description": "Warby Parker continues to put the customer first, now offering an augmented reality feature to virtually try on glasses.", "authors": ["Angelica Stabile"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/glasses.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
