In addition, there are many known blockchain projects absent from the two lists, but could likely be published in another installment.\n\nIn total, CoinDesk is able to reveal thumbnail sketches of several enterprise blockchain projects that could change the landscape of the Chinese technology industry.\n\nFinancial services\n\nTrade finance, asset management, cross-border payments and supply chain financing were the four most common use cases in the financial service industry projects included in the two lists.\n\nSix banks, including two major state-owned national banks and four local banks, have filed for 14 blockchain projects.\n\nIndustrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the world\u2019s largest bank by assets, and Ping An Bank, the banking arm of Ping An Insurance, have registered two blockchain projects each.\n\nPing An Bank disclosed a data analytics SAS plat\u00adform and a blockchain-dri\u00adven vot\u00ading and decision-making sys\u00adtem. The bank became the first Chinese financial institution in the R3 enterprise blockchain alliance in 2016, and has adopted a blockchain network called FiMax to improve data-sharing and privacy processes. Its goal was to increase efficiencies in asset-backed securities transactions, and tackle challenges in supply chain financing.\n\nUnion Pay, the Chinese counterpart of Visa or Mastercard, filed two blockchain services, including a digital certificate application and a blockchain-based tracking platform for cross-border capital transfers.\n\nICBC Xi Blockchain Ser\u00advice and ICBC Fi\u00adnan\u00adcial Ser\u00advices are blockchain projects to facilitate transactions for the bank\u2019s clients. ICBC partnered with China\u2019s central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, in 2017 to conduct research on blockchain technology, and launched its blockchain-based financing platform for small and medium-sized companies.\n\nWhile not on the list, two major banks had recently published much more detail on their blockchain projects, as reported earlier by CoinDesk.\n\nChina Construction Bank (CCB), one of the four major Chinese commercial banks, is revamping its trade finance blockchain-based platform, as trading volume on the platform reached $53 billion. CCB\u2019s projects included facilitating financial transactions such as factoring and forfaiting, providing immediate cash for exporters in exchange for short-term receivables.\n\nAlso, the Bank of China completed its first international money transfer to South Korea in dollars via its patented blockchain payment system last year.\n\nBaidu, Alibaba and Tencent\n\nOn the list is Baidu, the Chinese search engine giant, which released its blockchain white paper, detailing its patented Xuper Chain that aims to provide foundational infrastructure for blockchain services.\n\nThe company had also launched a decentralized application, or dapp, game called Letsdog last August, similar to the internet sensation CryptoKitties. The project is registered through Baidu\u2019s blockchain subsidiary Duxiaoman on the October list.\n\nAnother two Baidu projects were included in the March list, including Baidu Blockchain Engine providing cloud services and Token that leverages blockchain to protect digital content intellectual property rights.\n\nAlibaba Group is in a perpetual race for No. 1 against Baidu, Tencent and internet conglomerate Huawei for which of the four will develop the most advanced blockchain cloud services in China.\n\nStory continues", "description": "As President Xi called on China to seize blockchain opportunities, industry heavyweights are already leading hundreds of enterprise projects.", "authors": ["David Pan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KOeUO.x37c_dv3ss.M7qGQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/d45bcdcc7989b0c34d0dc2fdfafac42f", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
