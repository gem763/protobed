(AP) - Minshew Mania is gaining momentum.\n\nGardner Minshew threw two touchdown passes and should have had a third, Calais Campbell spearheaded another defensive gem and the Jacksonville Jaguars handled the Tennessee Titans 20-7 in sloppy conditions Thursday night.\n\nJacksonville (1-2) ended a four-game losing streak in the AFC South series and avoided the franchise\u2019s second 0-3 start in four years.\n\n\u201cThis felt good,\u201d defensive tackle Abry Jones said. \u201cWe needed this.\u201d\n\nWith all eyes on star cornerback Jalen Ramsey, who may have played his final game for Jacksonville, Minshew and a second stellar defensive outing in five days captured the spotlight.\n\nA sixth-round draft pick starting his second consecutive game in place of injured Nick Foles (broken collarbone), Minshew completed 20 of 30 passes for 204 yards. He found James O\u2019Shaughnessy wide open for a 7-yard score, which came one play after Adoree\u2019 Jackson\u2019s muffed punt. Minshew was more precise with a 22-yard touchdown pass to DJ Chark, who was blanketed by Malcolm Butler.\n\nFans chanted Minshew\u2019s name each time the offense took the field, and fans everywhere adorned fake mustaches and bandanas to mimic his signature look.\n\nMarcus Mariota got no style points in this one. Jacksonville sacked Mariota a whopping nine times, including three by Campbell.\n\n\u201cYou seen what the D-line did,\u201d Ramsey said, declining to talk about his potential trade. \u201cToday was their day. Everybody got a piece of it. I was excited to see those guys have a huge game.\u201d\n\nThe Jaguars played well enough to win at Houston last week, especially on the defensive side, but came up inches short on a 2-point conversion and lost 13-12.\n\nRamsey then gut-punched a franchise already reeling from the loss of Foles by requesting a trade hours after the loss to the Texans. He asked to get out following his sideline confrontation with coach Doug Marrone.\n\nRamsey later insisted he didn\u2019t want to be a distraction. He wasn\u2019t, at least not on the field.\n\nThe Jaguars enjoyed a 14-point lead in the first quarter for the first time since Week 2 of last season against New England and just the third time in the last five seasons.\n\nRamsey hugged several teammates after the game, but didn\u2019t say any goodbyes in the locker room.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t have to say anything,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe may be going to another team, but no one\u2019s going to be hurt by that. It\u2019s a business decision.\u201d\n\nThe Titans (1-2) struggled to play from behind.\n\nWith his team trailing 14-0 early in the third, coach Mike Vrabel passed on a short field goal and went for it on fourth-and-6 at the 11.Campbell abused backup guard Jamil Douglas, and Mariota had no time to get rid of the ball.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how you want to play that football team, from behind,\u201d Vrabel said. \u201cWe talked about that. This football team, you don\u2019t want to play from behind. They can really rush the passer.\u201d\n\nTennessee finally got on the scoreboard with Derrick Henry\u2019s 1-yard plunge early in the fourth. Henry finished with 44 yards on 17 carries, a far cry from his last game against Jacksonville. Henry ran for a franchise-record 238 yards and four touchdowns, including the second 99-yard run in NFL history (Tony Dorsett, 1983), in December.\n\nJacksonville wasn\u2019t going to let it happen again, stacking the box and doing a much better job tackling the 247-pound back.\n\nEven Ramsey got in a couple of shots on the 2015 Heisman Trophy winner.\n\nQUESTIONABLE CALLS\n\nThe officiating was roundly ripped - in the stands and around the country. The most head-scratching flags: Titans linebacker Kamalei Correa was called for roughing the passer in the second quarter, and Tennessee cornerback Logan Ryan was penalized for pass interference after barely touching Dede Westbrook.\n\nPatriots quarterback Tom Brady tweeted, \u201cToo many penalties. Just let us play!!!!\u201d He followed that tweet without another one a few minutes later, saying \u201cI\u2019m turning off this game I can\u2019t watch these ridiculous penalties anymore.\u201d\n\nSuspended Titans left tackle Taylor Lewan later added, \u201cWow, who would have thought that the refs would mess up so many calls?\u201d\n\nINJURIES\n\nJaguars linebacker Myles Jack took a knee to the helmet in the third quarter, was later ruled out and placed in the concussion protocol. \u2026 Jaguars receiver Chris Conley sprained his left ankle while blocking in the second, but later returned. \u2026 Titans linebacker Rashaan Evans injured his left shoulder just before halftime, returned in the second half and then left the field again in the fourth. \u2026 Titans linebacker Sharif Finch injured his right ankle in the third.\n\nDEDE DROPS\n\nJaguars receiver Dede Westbrook dropped a would-be touchdown in the third quarter, and Jacksonville had to settle for a 40-yard field goal and a 17-0 lead. It was Westbrook\u2019s third drop of the night.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Titans play at Atlanta. Tennessee has dropped the last two meetings.\n\nThe Jaguars play at Denver. Jacksonville has dropped the last two meetings.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Minshew Mania is gaining momentum.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Long"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/titans_jaguars_football_05420_c0-141-3358-2098_s1770x1032.jpg?b0c178de335ccf50c6012a2da109c4cc5ebfd0d4", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
