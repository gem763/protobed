But government opposition to her candidacy was not enough to prevent Kovesi being confirmed this month as the EU\u2019s first fraud prosecutor.\n\nShe starts the job next month, but warns against expecting immediate results from the new European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (EPPO) she will lead in the battle against fraud and corruption affecting the EU budget.\n\n\u201cI think there will be very high expectations once the institution effectively starts working on cases,\u201d Kovesi, 46, told Reuters in an interview. \u201cBut I think people must understand that credible results will come in two, three years, once final verdicts from courts start coming in.\u201d\n\nRomania\u2019s government has come under fire in the EU over changes to judicial legislation and staffing that have undermined the rule of law and weakened the fight against entrenched corruption.\n\nBut Kovesi, who is likely to start in her new role on Nov. 4, makes clear she will not be daunted by pressure from anyone.\n\n\u201cThere will certainly be pressure - once investigations start - on the institution and prosecutors, let\u2019s not forget that the people using European funds are generally businessmen, some of whom are very powerful,\u201d Kovesi said.\n\n\u201cBut I am extremely well trained for it, I am not even a little bit worried about that.\u201d\n\nMULTI-BILLION-EURO BUDGET\n\nThe EU is working on adopting a 2020 budget of nearly 160 billion euros ($177.5 billion). The bloc has lost just under 9 billion euros to tax fraud during 2002-2016, a report by the European Court of Auditors said earlier this year.\n\nDue to be launched in 2020, the EPPO will be geared to investigating and pressing criminal charges in cases crossing the EU\u2019s internal borders, particularly those affecting the budget since November 2017. Twenty-two of the EU\u2019s 28 member states are participating so far.\n\nMuch of the EPPO\u2019s efficacy will depend on Kovesi\u2019s ability to convince member states to give it the prosecutors and resources it needs. Some, such as Hungary, have not joined, saying prosecutorial powers should remain at the national level.\n\nKovesi will run the EPPO from a central office in Luxembourg alongside one European prosecutor from each member state. Investigations will be run by delegated prosecutors nationally.\n\nTheir number will be determined after negotiations with justice ministers and general prosecutors in each state. Kovesi said estimating the number of potential cases EPPO will handle and the number of prosecutors needed in each state are immediate priorities.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that in some states, the desire to have more prosecutors is bigger, maybe other states will not want to have that many,\u201d Kovesi said. \u201cThere will certainly be talks and negotiations to solve this problem.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nPrior to leading Romania\u2019s anti-corruption agency, Kovesi was the country\u2019s prosecutor general and worked her way up from being a prosecutor in the central Romanian city of Sibiu.\n\nThough she has protection, she still enjoys doing the things she used to do back then \u2014 walking, going to the park or gym, and attending church and has no plans to change her life in Luxembourg.\n\n\u201cIt is what I applied for, what I wanted,\u201d Kovesi said. \u201cFor now my main concern is to ensure the institution has the budget and resources it needs to work.\u201d", "description": "Romanians regularly stop Laura Codruta Kovesi in the street to shake her hand or to be photographed with the woman who for five years led the country's fight against corruption.", "authors": ["Luiza Ilie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445839993&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0Y0", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
