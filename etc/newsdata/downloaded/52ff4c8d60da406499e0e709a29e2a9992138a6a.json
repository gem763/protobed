He also tipped off Lindsey Graham, a senator from South Carolina who holds no official intelligence position.\n\nIn his morning address to the nation announcing the death of the Islamic State leader, Trump bluntly suggested that if Pelosi and her fellow Democrats had been given advance notice of the secret mission, lives of the American special forces involved could have been put at risk by leaks.\n\nThe House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not congressional leadership were notified of in advance Nancy Pelosi\n\n\u201cI wanted to make sure this was kept secret,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have people lost. A leak could have caused the death of all of them.\u201d\n\nPelosi reacted with scorn. In a statement released on Sunday, she praised the \u201cheroism, dedication and skill of our military and our intelligence professionals\u201d before going on to excoriate the president.\n\n\u201cThe House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top congressional leadership were notified of in advance,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump let it be known that he had informed Russia of the mission ahead of time.\n\n\u201cWe spoke to the Russians, we told them we are coming in,\u201d he said.\n\nSchumer also put out a statement. Though he did not refer to the shunning of the Group of Eight he did warn of the enduring presence of Isis and called for a \u201cbriefing about this raid and the plan to deal with the escaped Isis prisoners\u201d.\n\nSchiff told ABC\u2019s This Week the decision to cut out the eight was a mistake.\n\n\u201cIf something had gone wrong, had we gotten into a firefight with the Russians, it\u2019s to the administration\u2019s advantage to say, \u2018We informed Congress we were going in, we gave them the chance to give feedback.\u2019 That wasn\u2019t done.\u201d\n\nRelated: Author Joe Klein: anonymous Trump official of op-ed should come forward\n\nThe Gang of Eight consists of senior members of Congress drawn equally from the two main parties. It includes the speaker and the minority leader in the House, the Senate majority and minority leaders, and the chairs and ranking members of the two intelligence committees.\n\nThe rationale behind the collective is that the individuals can be relied upon to receive intelligence no matter how sensitive.\n\nAs Democrats were quick to point out, Barack Obama did brief the Gang of Eight before the mission that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011.\n\nThat Trump effectively accused Democratic leaders of being willing to put partisanship before country over something as serious as a special forces attack on America\u2019s top national security target is a sign of how wide the gulf has become under his presidency.\n\nTrump\u2019s griping about the extent of leaking is entirely understandable \u2013 his administration has indeed been as leaky as a sieve. But most of the big stories to emerge from inside the White House have come not from Democrats but from his own inner circle of senior aides, or from the whistleblower within the intelligence community who sounded the alarm over Ukraine.", "description": "* \u2018Gang of Eight\u2019 leaders not informed of strike against Isis chief  * Killing of Baghdadi gives Trump lifeline amid political battleNancy Pelosi talks to reporters on Capitol Hill this week.
