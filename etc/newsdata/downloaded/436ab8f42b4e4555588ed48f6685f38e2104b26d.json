There will be national and regional winners so there are plenty of opportunities for you to get your story shared!\n\nHOW TO ENTER\n\nYou can either write, record or film yourself telling us about this. Don't worry too much about the style or the format at this stage and remember we don't want the finished story - just an outline of what it is about.\n\nThere are two categories - My Life and Our World. There are two age groups for each of these depending on whether you are aged 11 to 15 or 16 to 18. Just enter one category.\n\n\"My Life\" must be an original personal story, about you or someone you know (you'll need their permission). It needs to be a story which has not been widely covered before. You will be expected to show how you would report on the wider context of the story, balancing any views and issues, and - if relevant - show how reporting it could raise wider awareness, and why this is important to you.\n\n\"Our World\" must be an original story around an issue or topic that is relevant to the world today. It needs to be an idea which has not been widely covered before, or offer a unique young person's perspective on the subject. The story does not need to be about your life or anyone in your world, but you must be able to show how the reporting of the story will offer a new or alternative angle, and why you reporting it will be unique.\n\nAll stories which reach the shortlist stage will be checked prior to final judging to make sure they are factually true and accurate and legally sound. So make sure yours is!\n\nParental permission is needed before you can enter, and if your story is about a sensitive topic, such as your health, your religion or your sexuality, then please get your parent/guardian to email us BEFORE you enter at youngreportercompetition@bbc.co.uk so we can offer the relevant advice and support.\n\nStories will be judged on editorial merit - that means the strength of story, originality, and the personal story or background around it. Judges will be looking for a range of diverse stories from across the UK.\n\nThe rules for the competition are here.\n\nThe privacy notice which tells you how we will use your information is here.\n\nDetails of the BBC Young Reporter Competition in Welsh are here.\n\nTIPS FOR ENTERING\n\nRemember we are looking for powerful personal stories and ideas related to subjects not usually broadcast on the BBC. They must be true.\n\nThe story must be original and about an issue or a personal experience or insight which has not been widely reported about before and/or reflects the life of the contributor or their friends and/or family. You should state why you think you reporting the story or issue will bring a unique perspective to it, but also how you would widen your report to look at the issues around the subject.\n\nEach entry will need to answer the following question: Why do you want to share your story and what would it mean to you to share your story. That's to give us a bit of background about why you want to tell this story, what it means to you - why it is relevant to you and your life.\n\nRemember we don't need the finished story, it is just the outline of it we want to hear about - so don't worry too much about how it is written or recorded.\n\nTo inspire you, here are some of the stories from last year's competition:\n\nAnnabelle shared her experience of having the menopause as a teenager.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption I'm going through the menopause at 15\n\nTayla's story explored the issue of organ donation after the death of her own mother and realising she had helped others through the donation of her organs.
