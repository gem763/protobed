Drugs aren\u2019t legal in Portugal but drug users aren\u2019t treated as criminals.\n\nIn 2001, possessing up to 10 days\u2019 supply of any drugs, including heroin , became a civil rather than a criminal offence. Today nobody goes to jail for using drugs. In the late 1990s half the people in prisons were drug offenders. Now it\u2019s down to a quarter.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t any government control. Those classified as recreational users are still punished, but with fines or community service.\n\nAnd people with a substance-use problem are referred \u2013 sometimes compulsorily \u2013 for treatment.\n\nThe Portuguese government has invested heavily in services for drug users, with a national needle exchange programme, state-issued drug kits, methadone subscription programmes for heroin users, and a network of drug-addiction centres.\n\nThe effects haven\u2019t been miraculous but drug use has significantly declined. In 1999, an estimated 1% of the \u00adpopulation were hooked on heroin, and Portugal had the highest rate of HIV infection in the EU. This situation has improved, says a report published in the British Medical Journal.\n\nHIV infections fell from an all-time high in 2000 of 104.2 new cases per million, to 4.2 cases in 2015. A similar downward trend has been observed for cases of hepatitis B and C among clients of drug treatment centres.\n\nThe number of deaths caused by drug \u00adoverdose has also decreased: by 2015 there were only 5.8 deaths per million people, compared with 20.3 in the EU at large and 45 in the UK.\n\nBut the big message is, especially to the doubters, that drugs have been decriminalised \u201cand the sky hasn\u2019t fallen in\u201d. The country isn\u2019t a \u00addestination for junkies, nor has violent crime increased. Quite the opposite.\n\nUsers who would have been \u00adcriminalised have become supervised patients in the public health system. Money that was spent incarcerating drug users is now spent on solving the social problems associated with drug use. By that criterion, the policy is a runaway success.\n\nSubstantial investment in harm reduction and treatment are vital components.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a total package\u201d, says Dr Joao Goulao, head of drugs agencies.\n\nThe Portuguese drugs policy is built on two struts \u2013 reducing drug demand and reducing drug supply. Freed from the need to arrest users, the police can concentrate on dealers and traffickers.\n\nEven cannabis remains illegal, unlike in Canada and many US states.\n\nThe question of legalisation is a whole different ball game. If class A drugs were legal in Portugal, the whole picture would change.\n\nShouldn\u2019t we be seriously thinking of imitating the Portuguese model?", "description": "Drug users are still punished \u2013 but instead of prison they are fined, get community service, and are ordered to get treatment for their addictions", "authors": ["Miriam Stoppard", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20551984.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Drugs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
