If you watch the best teams they take more risks with the ball, they make more runs in behind and that's part of the process for the boys.\"\n\nAt the club's annual staff meeting, executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward defended Solskjaer's credentials and the club's poor start to the campaign.\n\nSolskjaer said the overhaul of the squad is a long-term project and will need at least two more transfer windows to build a squad capable of competing for trophies.\n\n\"We've made some decisions that maybe in the short term would harm us but we know in the long term will benefit us and that's part of the plan,\" he added.\n\n\"The results are always the main thing, we can move forward quicker if we get results and performances. But I'm sure that we will get there.\"\n\nSolskjaer has already ruled out goalkeeper David De Gea and midfielder Paul Pogba from the weekend's clash against Liverpool due to injuries, but said defenders Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Luke Shaw could be available for selection.
