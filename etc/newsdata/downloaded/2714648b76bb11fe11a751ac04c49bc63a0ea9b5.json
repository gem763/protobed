REUTERS/Nick Oxford/Files\n\nThe United States is selling more oil overseas than ever, and refiners in Europe and Asia are scrutinizing the quality of that oil after some shipments of U.S. crude contained impurities or contaminants that made it difficult for overseas refiners to process. Two U.S. shipments were even refused by South Korea last year.\n\nOverseas buyers are demanding barrels that travel directly from wells to export terminals with little blending, to minimize problems introduced when crude passes multiple transport systems.\n\nLike that single malt Scotch, the biggest sellers of U.S. crude are touting so-called \u201cneat\u201d barrels, delivered direct from the shale patch to the Gulf, as a way of boosting the allure of the country\u2019s flagship Midland, Texas crude.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing from our customers around the world is they want pure Midland WTI blend,\u201d said Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at Trafigura.\n\nThe United States has become a top exporter of crude after ending a 40-year ban on exports in 2015, shipping more than 3 million barrels per day to buyers in China, South Korea, and across Europe.\n\nTo combat concerns about quality, producers and merchants are marketing barrels that come direct from the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, and pass from the wellhead through a pipeline straight to export facilities, as a way of distinguishing from barrels that first go north to the U.S. primary storage outpost in Cushing, Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cQuality reputation is crucial. Buyers ask about how well quality has been managed,\u201d Suh Sok-won, president of South Korea\u2019s SK Trading International, said earlier this year. \u201c(U.S.) sellers are on alert and quality stability has improved. Otherwise we\u2019re not buying oil from them.\u201d\n\nWith new pipelines recently opening that connect the Permian to the growing terminal in Corpus Christi, shippers say they can promote the idea of pure Permian barrels.\n\n\u201cThe consistent message that I continued to hear was: We want a clean barrel, we want a consistent barrel, and if at all possible, we want a neat barrel,\u201d said Josh Baskett, vice president of oil and gas marketing for Continental Resources, referring to conversations with refiners from Europe and Asia.\n\nTwo new pipelines with 1 million bpd of combined capacity came online last month that flow to Corpus, where crude loadings have doubled to about 1.1 million bpd this month from 577,000 bpd, according to market intelligence firm ClipperData.\n\nTrafigura is the biggest shipper on Plains All American Pipeline LP\u2019s new 670,000 bpd Cactus II pipeline and its shipments now account for more than a quarter of the country\u2019s total exports.\n\n\u201cThe ability to control quality in Corpus will be dramatically better than the ability to control quality in Houston,\u201d said Brian Freed, president of EPIC Midstream Holdings LP, in July, just before commercial deliveries on a new pipeline from the Permian to Corpus Christi started last month.\n\nThe Houston Ship Channel is still the most active Gulf port for loading crude barrels, according to Sandy Fielden, analyst at Morningstar, accounting for about 42% of barrels exported through August of this year, he said, citing RBN Energy Crude Voyager Data.\n\nHowever, those barrels are often blended, as many of the pipelines to Houston first hit Cushing, the way station for numerous grades sourced from further north as well. Cushing is the delivery point for benchmark U.S. crude futures, where there is currently nearly 39 million barrels in storage.\n\n\u201cYou have reputational issues for oil coming out of Houston because that\u2019s heavily blended,\u201d said Luckock.\n\nPipeline and terminal operators in Houston counter that Houston\u2019s vast access to storage and access to Cushing gives shippers more options for marketing barrels.\n\nWith new maritime emissions rules set to take effect in 2020, demand for neat Permian crude, which would produce low-sulfur compliant fuels, are likely to gain even more favor among simple Asian refiners compared with blended Cushing barrels, said Logan Moncrief, partner at energy-focused hedge fund Thomist Capital.\n\nIn 2019, Corpus accounted for about 21% of exported barrels. Fielden said the EPIC and Cactus lines will boost share out of Corpus, benefiting U.S. sellers.\n\n\u201cWe have to make sure that our barrel is segregated, it\u2019s clean because otherwise we\u2019re going to lose credibility in the international market,\u201d said Continental\u2019s Baskett. \u201cOnce you lose credibility with these Asian refiners, they\u2019re done with you.\u201d", "description": "Decades ago, a distiller in Scotland discovered the marketing power of \"single malt\" whisky, untouched by blending - a technique now being embraced by sellers of Texas crude oil.", "authors": ["Devika", "Krishna Kumar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432845058&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0BE", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
