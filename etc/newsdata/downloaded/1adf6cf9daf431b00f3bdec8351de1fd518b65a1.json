He even went so far as to promote a map with a circle awkwardly drawn around Alabama to make it look like the state was in the hurricane\u2019s path.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had presidents trying to cover up a sexual liaison with an intern and a botched burglary, but never have we had one who went to such lengths to cover up an inaccurate weather forecast,\u201d Reich wrote. \u201cAlabama being hit by a hurricane? Friends, this is not rational behavior.\u201d\n\nThen there was the planned \u2014 and canceled \u2014 secret meeting with the Taliban just days before the 18th anniversary of the September 11th terror attacks, and the cancelled trip to Denmark after the nation derided Trump\u2019s offer to purchase Greenland.\n\n\u201cHello? Greenland wasn\u2019t for sale,\u201d Reich wrote. \u201cThe U.S. no longer buys populated countries.\u201d\n\nTrump also \u201cbelieves video games cause mass shootings. He thinks climate change is no big deal. He says trade wars are \u2018good and easy to win.\u2019\u201d This is not an issue of simply an unusually large ego or excessive narcissism.\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States is seriously, frighteningly, dangerously unstable. And he\u2019s getting worse by the day,\u201d Reich wrote. \u201cSuch a person in the Oval Office can do serious damage.\u201d\n\nLove HuffPost?
