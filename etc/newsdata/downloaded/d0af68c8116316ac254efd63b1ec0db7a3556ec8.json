Now, these schools are also being designed in new ways to minimise the number of deaths during a mass shooting. And this segment from NBC News shows just how strange things have gotten in the country.\n\nNBC News took a tour of a new school in Fruitport, Michigan that\u2019s being designed with places where students can hide in the event of a mass shooting. Politicians have done absolutely nothing to protect America\u2019s schoolkids, and while school administrators feel powerless to provide real safety from firearms, they\u2019re scrambling to find design solutions for a political problem.\n\nThe segment is truly heartbreaking when you remind yourself that none of this is necessary in other wealthy countries.\n\n\u201cNo more lockers in the hallways, instead short lockers in a common area, so teachers can see 900 students at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was designed as a curve for a couple of reasons. And one of the reasons is to cut down on the line of sight of an active shooter.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we also installed these wing-walls to provide safety for students to hide behind if there\u2019s a threat down the hallway.\u201d\n\n\u201cA grant from Michigan state police paid for impact-resistant film on the windows, and a special system to lock down specific sections of the school.\u201d\n\n\u201cInside classrooms, another important wing-wall. \u2018If, God forbid, there were an active shooter, and we\u2019re back here, he can\u2019t see us.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Right, you could fit about 30 students in here sight unseen.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe part that the segment doesn\u2019t address? What if the school shooter gains access to the lockdown mechanism? Presumably, there would be some kind of control panel that allowed administrators to lock people into certain sections of the school, but any school shooter could then hypothetically use that same system to their advantage, locking hundreds of kids into one area and shooting them.\n\nRemember that \u201ccommon area\u201d where teachers can see 900 students at once? What\u2019s to stop a shooter from gaining access to the lockdown system and trapping kids before mowing them down with an assault rifle? The safety systems raise hundreds of questions like this and can potentially make students a lot less safe.\n\nMass shootings are a uniquely American problem, and yet politicians continue to tell their fellow Americans that nothing can be done to fix it. Republicans keep saying that it\u2019s a \u201cmental health issue,\u201d while insisting that assault weapons are just a part of life. But every country in the world has people struggling with mental health issues.\n\nOnly one advanced nation has a gun problem where 17-month old babies are injured in random mass shootings and it\u2019s simply accepted as a tragic but inevitable part of life.\n\nThere have been 297 mass shootings in the U.S. this year, as of August 31, defined as at least four people wounded or killed from firearms during a single event. Shootings inside churches and schools tend to get all the media attention, but the vast majority of mass shootings don\u2019t get much media attention as a gun control issue.\n\nFor example, a 14-year-old in Alabama killed five members of his family on Monday. And the NRA will tell Americans that there simply should\u2019ve been more guns at the scene, because the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. Or whatever other bullshit talking point they\u2019ve decided on today.\n\nYou can watch the entire NBC News segment on how schools are being designed to minimise deaths on YouTube. Or not. Sometimes we just need a mental break from it all. And if you need some peace today, give yourself permission. Maybe check out the \u201cFunniest Dachshund Wiener Dog Compilation 2019\" on YouTube. It\u2019s very good.
