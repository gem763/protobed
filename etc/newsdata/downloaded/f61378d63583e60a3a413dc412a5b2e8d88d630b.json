You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nCampbell goes on to explain how, as part of fashion month, luxury labels invest \u201cmillions\u201d into displaying their new collections in catwalk shows that usually last no longer than 10 minutes.\n\nEditors, buyers and influencers will travel, often by air, to the four major fashion week cities (New York, London, Milan and Paris) to see clothes that will go in stores in six months time, only to repeat the cycle six months later.\n\n\u201cThis seasonality seems increasingly absurd to me,\u201d Campbell writes before pointing out some of the other environmentally dubious actions in the fashion industry.\n\n\u201cRecently, a journalist friend was invited to interview a Japanese designer. Rather than do it over Skype, they were flown to Tokyo to meet said designer in person, over lunch,\u201d she notes.\n\nCampbell is aware of her own responsibility, but insists that the actions of one model will not surmount to tangible change. It is up to luxury conglomerates such as LVMH and Kering \u2013 who own Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Christian Dior between them \u2013 to impact change.\n\nUltimately, Campbell explains she wants more fashion brands to shoot their clothes locally, as opposed to flying abroad for exotic locations, and to be more transparent about their sustainability efforts.\n\n\u201cMostly, I would love people to buy less,\u201d she concludes \u201cEven if that would put me out of a job.\u201d", "description": "Edie Campbell has confessed to feeling \u201ccomplicit\u201d in the fashion industry\u2019s \u201cenvironmental problem\u201d.", "authors": ["Olivia Petter"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/13/12/gettyimages-1147430927.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
