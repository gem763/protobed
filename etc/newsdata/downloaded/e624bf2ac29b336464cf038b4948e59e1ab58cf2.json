Only some types of content will be able to be appealed at first (such as pictures removed for nudity or hate speech), and Instagram plans to expand the available content appeal types over time.\n\nThe change will help clarify for users why they\u2019re in trouble and should remove the shock of suddenly finding that your account has vanished. While it\u2019s likely that a great number of banned accounts are removed for obvious rule violations, Instagram \u2014 like its parent company Facebook \u2014 has regularly had moderation problems when it comes to nudity and sexuality, where users have had photos removed for posting pictures of breastfeeding or period blood. This update won\u2019t prevent those mistakes (those types of photos are supposed to be allowed), but it would make appealing the decision easier.\n\nIn addition to the new alert, Instagram is also going to give its moderating team more leeway to ban bad actors. Instagram\u2019s policy has been to ban users who post \u201ca certain percentage of violating content,\u201d but it\u2019ll now ban people who repeatedly violate its policies within a window of time, too. The specifics here are all as vague as ever, as Instagram doesn\u2019t want to offer details and let bad actors game the system, but it sounds like it could lead to fewer problematic accounts slipping through on a technicality.", "description": "The alert will show users a history of the posts, comments, and stories that Instagram has had to remove from their account, as well as why they were removed. \"If you post something that goes against our guidelines again, your account may be deleted,\" the page reads. \nThe alert will show users a history of the posts, comments, and stories that Instagram has had to remove from their account, as well as why they were removed. \"If you post something that goes against our guidelines again, your account may be deleted,\" the page reads.", "authors": ["Jacob Kastrenakes", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vR_EWYWhiOIVDQnxil0svZic8qs=/0x157:2187x1302/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18319047/Disable_Thresholds_2_up_EN.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-18"}
