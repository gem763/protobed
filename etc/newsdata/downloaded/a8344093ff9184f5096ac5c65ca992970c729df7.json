I have just told him he is like the Benjamin Button of television, getting younger before our eyes since he first appeared on the show as a fairly unknown Irish pop manager 15 years ago. He starts to chuckle. \u2018First Simon made me have my eye bags done. I went to Sharon\u2019s [Osbourne] man for that \u2013 and she knows all the best surgeons. Then Simon got on about my hair.\u2019\n\nLouis Walsh reveals why X Factor boss Simon Cowell insisted he had a pop-star makeover\n\nHe puts on a camp posh accent: \u2018\u201cDarling, you have a bald spot at the back of your head. You can see it on the telly. Not nice. You need to get that sorted.\u201d So I went to a lovely fellow who took some hair off the back of my head and put it on the top. So it\u2019s actually your own hair just put back in the right place. And then there\u2019s the teeth. I\u2019ve had my teeth whitened, but everybody does that now. And that\u2019s it. Simon loves all the grooming. His dressing room is crammed with make-up artists, hairdressers, stylists, people making juices and setting up vitamin drips. I get my suit and have done whatever needs doing. I\u2019m low-maintenance. And I\u2019m not going vegan.\u2019\n\nHe is still chuckling, particularly at the dig about Cowell\u2019s recent conversion to veganism, losing two stone in the process. But in fact Walsh rarely stops laughing, exploding with mirth mid-sentence, pausing to tell me unrepeatable, hilarious tales, because Walsh is having a whale of a time back on prime-time TV. On top of that we are indulging him in his favourite subjects: music, gossip and the madness of celebrity. Walsh takes none of it seriously.\n\nHe is back on The X Factor after being reinstated by Cowell for the third time after the high-profile and expensive signing of Robbie Williams along with his wife, Ayda Field, and the former One Direction singer, Louis Tomlinson, scored the lowest ratings in the show\u2019s history.\n\nDoes he take it personally when he gets the occasional boot from Cowell?\n\n\u2018No. I\u2019ve had more comebacks than Frank Sinatra,\u2019 he says. \u2018The first time I got a bit of a shock but I sort of knew it was coming. You have to keep changing things up. I\u2019ve been in this business all my life. I get it. Everything has a lifespan. Everything needs tweaking to keep it current. But it\u2019s good to be back. I love being back with Simon. There\u2019s something completely addictive about him.\u2019\n\nThey refer to each other as \u2018Miss Walsh\u2019 and \u2018Mrs Cowell\u2019 and have done since they first became acquainted in the music business. After seeing Take That in concert in 1993, Walsh put together five Dublin boys \u2013 Boyzone \u2013 to rival the British boy band. He tried to get Cowell, who then had his own record label, to sign them, but was told they\u2019d \u2018never work\u2019.\n\nWalsh hopes critics are wrong about The X Factor, which is seen by many TV pundits to be on its last legs, with 2018 ratings at an all-time low\n\nTwenty-five million record sales later, Cowell did fly out to meet Walsh\u2019s next band, Westlife, in 1998. \u2018He said he\u2019d sign them on the condition I got rid of Shane [Filan] who was the lead vocalist. Shane had the best voice. I told him to cut his hair and dye it blond. Next time Simon saw him he said: \u201cThat guy\u2019s much better.\u201d I didn\u2019t tell him for another six months that it was still Shane. We both laughed our heads off. And that\u2019s when we became really good friends.\u2019\n\nWe have digressed. It is a professional hazard with Walsh, who is forever taking you down another entertaining rabbit hole. Take, for example, Cheryl. \u2018I\u2019ve got to like Cheryl now. It\u2019s taken time. And she\u2019s much happier since she had her baby. We clashed on The X Factor. She had it in for me because I didn\u2019t do much with Girls Aloud and I was meant to manage them. She had a point. But it was because I didn\u2019t want to. None of them could stand each other and I was terrified. And I made things worse because I thought the star was Nadine [Coyle] because she had the best voice. But it was Cheryl and Sarah [Harding] who all the guys fancied so I was totally wrong there.\u2019\n\nHe hopes critics are wrong about The X Factor, which is seen by many TV pundits to be on its last legs, with 2018 ratings at an all-time low, the BBC\u2019s Strictly dancing on the grave of their audience figures and ITV\u2019s new Saturday-night entertainment show, The Masked Singer \u2013 featuring Jonathan Ross, Davina McCall and Rita Ora \u2013 rumoured to be ready to kill off The X Factor for good.\n\nFrom left: Nadine Coyle, Nicola Roberts, Sarah Harding, Cheryl Tweedy and Kimberley Walsh of Girls Aloud; Louis Walsh was the group\u2019s original manager\n\nThis time round The X Factor is a whole new show. Cowell has brought back the original format of three judges \u2013 himself, Walsh and former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger \u2013 but changed the format of the show. The first run will involve contestants made up of a heady cocktail of Love Island and TOWIE stars competing for a record deal along with the likes of Vinnie Jones and, bizarrely, BBC journalist Martin Bashir, who famously interviewed Princess Diana in 1995. A second spin-off show \u2013 X Factor All Stars \u2013 will involve former contestants battling it out to win the crown and reinvigorate their career.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s turned the whole thing on its head,\u2019 says Walsh. \u2018It\u2019s upbeat, it\u2019s entertaining. People will not believe it when they hear someone like Martin Bashir sing.\u2019\n\nSo the underlying cruel streak in The X Factor, such as the \u2018six-chair challenge\u2019, where contestants were given places in the final only to be swapped at the last minute, all of this has gone?\n\nWalsh nods. \u2018That was a mistake,\u2019 he says. \u2018Simon admits it himself. A big mistake.\u2019 It is no surprise given the pressure ITV bosses have been under to follow a stringent psychological procedure after two former contestants on Love Island took their lives and The Jeremy Kyle Show was axed earlier this year after three suspected suicides of guests.\n\nLouis Walsh with old friend and fellow X Factor judge Simon Cowell; this series will Walsh\u2019s 14th on the show\n\nWalsh looks serious. \u2018You know, I have been so conscious of that right from the beginning. It\u2019s in your head all the time: I hope nothing is going to happen to these people, I hope you can take rejection, I hope you are not going to do something stupid like commit suicide.\n\n\u2018Rejection is part of the show. It is part of this business, but we do always make sure we are available, that we can talk to people.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve lain awake in bed during the shows totally unable to sleep worrying about song choices, worrying about whether they will be on their game. All my contestants have my personal mobile number. We have a very good team behind the scenes. During the run of the show I am up all night worrying about them. It\u2019s always on your mind.\u2019\n\nCheryl had it in for me because I didn\u2019t do much with Girls Aloud. She had a point. But I\u2019ve got to like her now\n\nTo be fair, The X Factor, which has had a psychiatrist on board working with contestants since 2007, has a clean record among its wannabe stars. It is its judges, however, who have presented the more worrying issues. The feud between Dannii Minogue and Sharon Osbourne (both judges on the show 12 years ago) created endless stress for all concerned \u2013 \u2018I was Team Sharon,\u2019 says Walsh.\n\nThen, after three years judging on the UK show, Cheryl admitted she had a \u2018breakdown\u2019 after being sacked from the US show in 2011, and in 2014 Spice Girl Melanie Brown took an overdose just a week before the final show. \u2018She called me that night,\u2019 says Walsh. \u2018It was the early hours of the morning and she was whispering into the phone and then just rang off. I couldn\u2019t understand what she was saying. I knew her husband was a problem but none of us realised how bad it was. None of us realised she had taken an overdose.\u2019\n\nWalsh is, of course, familiar with the perils of drink and drugs. It makes him sad. \u2018The waste of it all. You have a great life. And you let stupid people in around you and then you let it all become a mess.\u2019 He talks about working alongside Britney Spears on that ill-fated US version of The X Factor in 2011. \u2018I was sitting next to her on the panel and realised she was wearing ear plugs while people were auditioning. Ear plugs. I couldn\u2019t believe it. We would get through four or five auditions and then we\u2019d notice she\u2019d slumped to the side and we\u2019d all have to have a break. She didn\u2019t engage with me at all until I told her I knew the actor Colin Farrell [whom Walsh rejected when he tried to join Boyzone]. She said: \u201cI love Colin Farrell.\u201d And after that we would talk about Colin Farrell.\u2019 He shrugs. And then smiles. \u2018Crazy, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\nWalsh himself does not drink, smoke or do drugs. Never has done. \u2018I have two addictions. Coffee and [the painkiller] Solpadeine, which I take if I\u2019m feeling run down. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m 67 years old. I worry about dying all the time so I worry about my health. I don\u2019t want to die because I absolutely love my life. I have the worst FOMO [Fear Of Missing Out] so I don\u2019t want to go anywhere. I want to carry on in the music business and in television because it\u2019s basically a hobby and a passion that I actually get paid for. That\u2019s a big part of the reason I\u2019ve never wanted to drink or take drugs because I know I\u2019m so lucky to be in this world.\u2019\n\nWalsh with Britney Spears on the US X Factor in 2012. 'She didn\u2019t engage with me at all until I told her I knew the actor Colin Farrell'\n\nHe is reportedly worth around \u00a3104 million but lives a fairly modest life. He does, however, own a vast art collection that includes several Warhols, Hockneys and Hirsts. He has homes in Miami, London and Dublin. And he loves to travel, most recently to Los Angeles. A matter of weeks ago he was staying chez Cowell and witnessed a new family side to the man: playtime with his five-year-old son, Eric; early nights and his new healthy vegan regime. \u2018I did used to worry about Simon. He never slept. He was all work, work, work but Lauren [Silverman, his partner of six years and mother of his only son] has been the making of him. He loves being a dad.\u2019\n\nFamily is important to Walsh. It was his father, Frank, who introduced him to music, the likes of Mario Lanza and the soundtrack to My Fair Lady. The young Walsh, who was bullied at school, found his escape.\n\nMel B called me in the early hours, but I didn\u2019t realise she\u2019d taken an overdose\n\n\u2018I was hooked,\u2019 he says, eyes alight. \u2018In Ireland they had showbands who would play cover versions and I would follow them. I made friends with the musicians and got some bands on as support and made a bit of money. There was no plan B. I couldn\u2019t sing, I couldn\u2019t play an instrument but I had to be part of that world.\u2019\n\nHis first job was with a Dublin agency and his first big find was Johnny Logan, whom he put in for the Eurovision Song Contest and found himself handling a winner and travelling with him to TV stations all over the world. \u2018I learned on the job.\u2019\n\nIt was his move to manager and mogul that really put him on the map with Boyzone and Westlife, making millions in the process. The secret of his success is, he believes, simple. \u2018You have to laugh at everything and don\u2019t get sucked into the madness.\u2019\n\nInterestingly, the thing he liked most about Cowell when they first became friends was that \u2018he was so charming to everyone, so hysterically camp and he never, ever cursed\u2019.\n\nHe was also impressed at his instinct for a hit. \u2018I remember when a guy played Baby One More Time. Simon wanted it. He wouldn\u2019t let up even though the guy was always going to give it to Britney Spears. Simon said to him: \u201cI\u2019ll give you more and buy you a Mercedes.\u201d I like that in him. Relentlessness. It\u2019s what you have to have. JLS were definitely going to win The X Factor when I was their mentor but Simon managed to get Beyonc\u00e9 to duet with Alexandra Burke and that\u2019s why she won. He\u2019ll do anything to win. He\u2019s a self-made man and he has made more millionaires than anyone in the business.\n\n\u2018A lot of those millionaires become monsters because they forget they are lucky to be in that position. Like the boys from One Direction. It was Simon who made that band. They weren\u2019t the best singers, they couldn\u2019t write their own songs, they were never The Beatles, but they all made millions thanks to Simon and a lot of them forgot about that.\u2019\n\nI ask if he has any regrets. He shakes his head: \u2018I would be very ungrateful if I had. But it would be wonderful if Sharon was on the X Factor with me, Nicole and Simon.\u2019 He giggles as he\u2019s about to take his leave. \u2018And she\u2019s got a new face, you know. She\u2019s just had it done. I say: \u201cSharon, you need to show off your new face.\u201d And she roars with laughter. We both know it\u2019s all a game, so you might as well have some fun.\u2019\n\n\u2018The X Factor: Celebrity\u2019 begins next Saturday on ITV at 8.35pm", "description": "'First Simon made me have my eye bags done.
