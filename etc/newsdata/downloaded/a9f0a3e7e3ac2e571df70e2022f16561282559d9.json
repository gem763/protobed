That prompted her to loudly condemn Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren for crediting \u201chard-working women\u201d for the country\u2019s success at a recent campaign rally.\n\n\u201cHer comments, kind of tossing off the involvement of men in our society, it speaks volumes about the direction the Democrats will take if they gain control again,\u201d Ingraham declared. \u201cSo men who are heterosexual, strong, aggressive competitors, are no longer an acceptable part of society, not really. They are the problem.\u201d\n\nAfter grumbling that the American Psychological Association noted that toxic masculinity can lead to aggression, violence, substance abuse, and early mortality, the conservative host then took aim at the entertainment industry.\n\n\u201cWell, of course, for years Hollywood has been pushing the skinny jean, crop top, pajama boy version of masculinity on us and we have gotten kind of used to it,\u201d she groused. \u201cNow even time-honored male brands and businesses are trying to make men feel guilty about being men.\u201d\n\nThat, naturally, led to Ingraham bringing up Gillette\u2019s ad campaign denouncing toxic masculinity. The commercial sparked widespread conservative outrage, especially from Ingraham, who has covered it for months now.\n\n\u201cWell, not all boys will be boys but you almost think so after watching ads like that,\u201d she huffed. \u201cIt used to be only the fringiest of the fringe feminists believe that traditional family structures were inherently oppressive and dangerous. Of course, with men\u2014head of the household in some cases\u2014being the main culprits.\u201d", "description": "The entertainment industry is waging war against heterosexual males, the Fox News host said Wednesday, and \u201ctrying to make men feel guilty about being men.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568863310/ingraham-angle_34_uk97xj", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
