Most Democratic primary voters still consider him the candidate that has the best chance of defeating President Trump in 2020 and bringing the White House back to the Democratic Party. But Biden's support is at a new low. He captures the support of 29 percent of Democratic primary voters, the poll says. That\u2019s down 2 points since last month and down 6 points since May when he was at a high of 35 percent support. His current 11-point lead is down from a high of 19 points in June. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., climbs back into second with 18 percent (up 8 points since August), followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., at 16 percent (down 4), forming the clearest top-three candidate tier seen in the race to date.\n\nBolton slams Trump's 'disrespectful' foreign policy at luncheon: report\n\nFormer national security adviser John Bolton on Wednesday reportedly blasted President Trump\u2019s aborted plan to invite the Taliban to Camp David, saying the move sent a \u201cterrible signal\u201d and was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to the victims of 9/11 because the Taliban had harbored Al Qaeda. Bolton, speaking at a private luncheon, also said negotiations with North Korea and Iran were \u201cdoomed to failure\u201d on the president\u2019s watch, two attendees told Politico. One witness said Bolton, who parted ways with the administration last week, ripped Trump without using his name. He also said Trump\u2019s failure to respond to the Iranian attack on an American drone earlier this summer set the stage for its aggression in recent months, including last Saturday's attack on Saudi oil fields. - The New York Post\n\nOcasio-Cortez faces primary challenge from second-generation Queens immigrant\n\nRep.
