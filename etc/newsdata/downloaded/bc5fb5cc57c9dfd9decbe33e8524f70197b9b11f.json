That and more in Trysta Krick's Week 7 overreactions. USA TODAY\n\nTo say New York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold had an awful game against the Patriots on \"Monday Night Football\" would be a huge understatement. He threw four interceptions and also lost a fumble in a 33-0 blowout loss to the New England Patriots at MetLife Stadium.\n\nThe former USC star who was the No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 NFL draft is mic'd up for the game and after his second interception he was heard saying on the sidelines: \"I'm seeing ghosts.\"\n\nYeah, that's not something you want to be hearing from your QB during any game.\n\nCheck this out for yourself:\n\nOh no Sam Darnold do not admit to \"seeing ghosts\" when you're mic'd up in prime time. pic.twitter.com/E0pukwhL4s \u2014 Will Brinson (@WillBrinson) October 22, 2019\n\nDarnold threw for just 34 yards in the first half, which ESPN said was his fewest at halftime in his career. He was just 6-for-13 passing with the two interceptions.\n\nHe then threw another interception on the Jets' first series after halftime and added a fourth in the end zone with New York driving down 26-0.\n\nAfter the game, he was asked about the \"seeing ghosts\" comment, saying, \"For me, I just got to see the field a lot better. That's kinda what that means. It was a rough day out there. Rough night out there. Obviously, I got to be better, learn from the mistakes.\"\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
