Bernie Sanders (I-VT) picked up the support of Linn County Board of Supervisors\u2019 Stacey Walker this week, a coveted endorsement who is featured as one of the \u201c50 Most Wanted Democrats\u201d per the Des Moines Register.\n\nSanders, who visited the Hawkeye State this week, officially picked up the endorsement of Linn County Board of Supervisors\u2019 Stacey Walker. Walker is featured on the Des Moines Register\u2019s \u201c50 Most Wanted Democrats\u201d list, which describes him as a \u201cdynamic and charismatic speaker\u201d who is continuing to \u201cgain prominence on the Linn County Board of Supervisors\u201d:\n\nA Cedar Rapids native, Walker is active in the local community and Iowa politics. National Democrats like California U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, a possible 2020 candidate, campaigned with him in 2018.\n\nWhile Walker said there are many qualified candidates in the race, Sanders is by far \u201cthe most progressive and best positioned to defeat Donald Trump in the general election.\u201d\n\nWalker added that Sanders \u201cgoes to the furthest\u201d in terms of his sweeping progressive plans and added that the Vermont senator has been \u201ctalking about these issues for decades.\u201d\n\nHe told the local CBS station:\n\nWhen you add on top of the fact that he has brought together one of the most diverse coalition of supporters I think any presidential campaign has ever seen, what that means is we actually have a shot at achieving this ambitious policy program, because we\u2019re going to have folks mobilize to put pressure on members of Congress to make sure we can pass this legislation.\n\nWalker also told Politico that he is backing Sanders because the country needs someone with a \u201cbold\u201d vision in order to \u201ccourse-correct from the disaster that Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have become.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is what America needs to course-correct from the disaster that Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have become,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need a leader with a bold vision, and as a black man living in America, I\u2019ve had enough of politicians telling me we have to scale back our dreams and ambitions,\u201d he added.\n\nSanders is currently battling for the heart of Iowa, edging out Joe Biden (D) but falling behind Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) in the latest Civiqs survey released this week.\n\nThe poll shows Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) leading in the Hawkeye State with 28 percent support, followed by Buttigieg, Sanders, and Biden with 20 percent, 18 percent, and 12 percent, respectively:", "description": "Sen.
