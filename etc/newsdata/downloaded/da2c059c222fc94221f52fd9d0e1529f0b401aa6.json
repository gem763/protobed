REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo\n\nIn a letter to CEO Steve Easterbrook, 115 mayors, commissioners, city councilors and school board members asked McDonald\u2019s to meet with workers, hear their stories and together craft tougher policies to effectively stamp out harassment.\n\nThe officials are part of a advocacy network called Local Progress.\n\nMembers of the U.S. Congress have written similar letters and employees have ratcheted up pressure on McDonald\u2019s at a time that the chain and other fast food restaurants have struggled to find and retain enough staff.\n\nThe letter said McDonald\u2019s employees have filed more than 50 sexual harassment complaints with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Reuters could not verify this because EEOC complaints are not public.\n\nWhen asked to comment on the letter, McDonald\u2019s referred Reuters to its Aug. 28 statement announcing a new training program for safe workplaces, which has support from more than 2,000 franchisees.\n\n\u201cTogether with our franchisees, we have a responsibility to take action on this issue and are committed to promoting positive change,\u201d said Chris Kempczinski, McDonald\u2019s USA president. \u201cThese actions are one more step we are taking to raise awareness at all levels of McDonald\u2019s that will transfer both inside and outside the workplace.\u201d\n\nWorkers and those organizing them are trying to pressure McDonald\u2019s, the largest U.S. restaurant chain by sales, to boost wages and address violence and harassment problems at its roughly 14,000 U.S. locations, most of them independently owned.\n\nOn Tuesday, workers at a Los Angeles McDonald\u2019s walked off the job to protest, saying retaliation for reporting sexual harassment is rampant and they have been excluded from policy discussions, according to organizers and news reports - one of several similar protest in the last year and a half.\n\nLast year, McDonald\u2019s started working with RAINN, the largest anti-sexual violence organization in the country, to improve its policies.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s August announcement was for an even broader program focused on mitigating violence, harassment, bias and bullying, to start in October.", "description": "Scores of local government officials from 31 U.S. states pressured McDonald's Corp's on Thursday to do a better job of protecting workers from groping, obscene comments and other forms of sexual harassment, adding their voices to an employee-led campaign that has seen walkouts at several stores.", "authors": ["Hilary Russ", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434183919&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1D8", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
