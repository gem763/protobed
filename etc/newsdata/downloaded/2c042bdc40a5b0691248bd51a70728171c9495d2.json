The AirPods had richer bass and a fuller sound. We switched to other songs, and the verdict didn't change.\n\nBut it doesn't really matter. Amazon wins on affordability and versatility.\n\nThe Buds, which begin shipping Wednesday, sell for $129, that's $30 less than the starting price of the AirPods and nearly half the cost of Apple's new $250 AirPod Pro models, which are also being released Wednesday.\n\nAmazon's Echo Buds in the ear of Jan Schreiber (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\n\nSmart specs: Amazon unveils its first-ever pair of smart glasses, the Echo Frames\n\nGot a new (or used) iPhone: Here are some tips and tricks to make the most of it\n\nThe new AirPod Pros tout better sound, a new design and noise cancellation. The Buds are all about Alexa and putting the Amazon voice assistant in your ear \u2013 for a lower price.\n\nAnd the audio difference? The average consumer won't care.\n\nPrice will play a big factor for people looking to add bluetooth earbuds to their collection. And as a potential holiday gift that could see the usual Amazon practice of deep holiday discounts, Mom and dad aren't going to do audio tests before they click the Buy button.\n\nAnd the bottom line is this: When you're not comparing the Buds to the Pods, and just grooving to music in your ears, the Amazon product sounds just fine. Rather good, in fact.\n\nWhat we like:\n\n\u2014Price. Affordable and competitive.\n\n\u2014The Buds stay in the ear pretty well, even when you're jogging.\n\n\u2014Bose active noise cancellation can help shield you from unwanted sounds.\n\nAmazon's Echo Buds in the ear of Jan Schreiber (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\n\nWhat we don't like:\n\n\u2014Making phone calls with voice commands isn't as easy as Amazon would like you to believe. There's a lot of being sent to the Alexa smartphone app for fine-tuning.\n\n\u2014Unlike the AirPods, which answer only to Siri, with the Buds you have the choice of going with Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant. But that's spotty, too.\n\n\u2014Voice commands for music only works with select partners \u2013 Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio and TuneIn, as well as Amazon Music. So if you're a fan of YouTube Music or Apple Music, that could be an issue.\n\n\u2014Friendly tip: If you're using the Buds in the same room with an Echo speaker, the speaker will probably be replying to your query, so you'll want to go to the app and change the \"wake word\" from Alexa to \"computer,\" \"Echo\" or \"Amazon,\" to get a clear response from the Buds.\n\nSetup\n\nYou start using the Buds rather painlessly by pairing them via Bluetooth, in your phone settings, and adding them as a device in your Alexa smartphone app.\n\nFrom there on, phone calls, music and podcast playback comes through the Buds, and not your phone speaker.\n\nThe bonus is that you can use Alexa to guide you around. But in the case of the music partners Amazon isn't working with, like Apple Music and YouTube Music, you can still use your fingers to access music manually.\n\nCalling\n\nIn theory, you can ask Alexa to make a phone call for you. But first, you have to make sure that person's number is in your contact list and visible within the Alexa app. In theory. So when I asked Alexa to call my colleague Ed Baig, it told me he wasn't in the Contacts, except he was.\n\nI opened the app to call him manually, by clicking his name in the Contacts, and it went iPhone to iPhone without a hitch.\n\nTriple assistants\n\nAmazon says you can use whatever voice assistant you like by holding down on a bud and waiting for a chime. You then ask the question to the assistant of your choice.\n\nAgain, in theory.\n\nI did successfully ask a question to the Google Assistant. Siri said it was having \"communication problems\" and couldn't connect. It never did.\n\nFor battery life, Amazon promises five hours of music and four hours of talk time. I didn't do a scientific battery test, just listened to a bunch of music, made the call to Ed and noticed that battery life had fallen down to the 40% level.\n\nI put the Buds back into the charged case \u2013 without plugging them into electricity, left them there for 15 minutes, and got them up to 97%. So consider me impressed.\n\nAmazon promises a bunch of different gestures to learn for voice operation, like double tapping a bad when the phone rings to accept a call, or holding down on one bud and waiting for a chime to switch voice assistant. There's a lot for consumers to learn.\n\nMy hunch is most will primarily use these for listening to music and podcasts and talking on the phone. And at $129 and probably less, the Ear Buds makes a fine, more affordable competitor to the AirPods. So what if they don't sound as good?\n\nI don't care. And I'm guessing you won't either.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham on Twitter, @jeffersongraham\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/29/amazons-echo-buds-headphones-trump-apple-airpods-price-not-sound/2485356001/", "description": "Amazon looks to have one of holiday season's most popular gifts, to take on what Apple says is the best-selling headphone anywhere, the AirPods.", "authors": ["Jefferson Graham", "Published A.M.
