REUTERS/Guadalupe Pardo\n\nLIMA (Reuters) - The head of Peru\u2019s dissolved Congress presented a legal appeal to the country\u2019s top court on Thursday seeking to suspend the closure of parliament on the grounds that President Mart\u00edn Vizcarra had exceeded his constitutional powers.\n\nVizcarra, a centrist, dissolved Congress late last month and swore in a new Cabinet last week following a lengthy stand-off between with lawmakers over his anti-corruption reforms.\n\nPedro Olaechea, the former Congress president who now leads the smaller permanent parliamentary commission, submitted the appeal requesting the \u201carbitrary\u201d dissolution of Congress be suspended, according to the document seen by Reuters.\n\nThe move marks one of the last throws of the dice for Congress after Vizcarra appeared to outmanoeuvre the opposition-controlled legislature, which had long blocked his reforms.\n\nHis move to dissolve Congress received support from the armed forces, police and Peru\u2019s voters, with a poll on Thursday showing his popular support had jumped around a third to 82%, the highest level during his administration.\n\nThe stand-off with Congress also involved a conflict over the appointment of new judges to Peru\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal, the top court, adding an extra edge to proceedings.\n\nThe past three years in Peru have been marked by repeated clashes between the executive and legislative branches and back-to-back corruption scandals, including one that led former President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski to resign in March last year.", "description": "The head of Peru's dissolved Congress presented a legal appeal to the country's top court on Thursday seeking to suspend the closure of parliament on the grounds that President Mart\u00edn Vizcarra had exceeded his constitutional powers.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439494037&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A01J", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
