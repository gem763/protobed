But there was one positive development. Screeching about global warming was limited.\n\nWhile a large slice of America sees this as a feature, the Democrats\u2019 allies in the press thought it was a bug.\n\n\u201cCNN slammed for asking about Ellen, but not climate change, at Democratic debate,\u201d howled USA Today.\n\n\u201cEllen DeGeneres\u2019 friendship with former President George W. Bush made it onto the agenda but climate change and immigration did not,\u201d moaned Newsweek.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have spent more than 90 minutes so far talking about health care \u2014 about twice as much time as they\u2019ve spent discussing either foreign policy or climate change,\u201d said Vox.\n\nEven the candidates themselves groused.\n\n\u201cThree hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration,\u201d tweeted former Housing Secretary Julian Castro, who believes \u201cclimate change is an existential threat.\u201d\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, apparently looking over Castro\u2019s shoulder as he tittered on Twitter \u2014 or maybe it was the other way around \u2014 tweeted \u201cThree hours. Not one question about the climate crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn entire debate without a single question on climate change \u2014 the existential issue facing not just our country, but our entire planet,\u201d Tom Steyer, the billionaire who made a good portion of his fortune investing in coal and other fossil fuels, grumbled in an overheated tweet.\n\nIs it possible the Democrats have ginned so many phony issues that if they bite off too many in one debate the public will suffer from an overload of nonsense? Did CNN intentionally steer clear of the subject to help Democrats avoid looking completely loony?\n\nWhatever the case, to many the omission was refreshing. They\u2019re weary of the hysterics, the witless worship of a child, the blind religious fervor, the junk science scooped up like dung from a horse stall then dumped on the public, and the effort to deceive the public. They are also tired of the entire charade being a front for taking over the economy.\n\nWe understand that some out there strongly feel they need to perpetuate the narrative that man is torching his planet with emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Politicians want to advance their careers so they take up the cause. Some elected officials see the climate campaign as a means for amassing ever-greater raw political power. The insecure need to express their moral superiority through electric vehicles, solar panels, and school-marm nagging. The busybodies have a need to meddle they must fulfill. Those driven by envy see an opportunity to bring down those more successful than they are. The scientists who have set off the alarms have reputations to save.\n\nFor once we\u2019d like to see some healthy skepticism of the narrative among Democrats. But they will never take that road, any more than they would admit that poverty isn\u2019t solved by government programs, that society\u2019s ills aren\u2019t cured by invasive public policy, or that a utopia cannot be established by the state if only the right people are issuing the directives.\n\nThe Democrats need the hobgoblin of warming to raise cash, raise political visibility, and raise the temperature of the electorate \u2014 which would be the only thing that\u2019s getting hotter.\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
