The actor who featured as Thor has installed hundreds of solar panels on the roof of his $20 million (Rs 142 crore) Byron Bay mega-mansion in Australia. The actor who is originally from Australia will be moving in with his wife Elsa Pataky and their three children in November, reports dailymail.co.uk.\n\nAs their house nears completion after three years of construction work, it appears that Chris and Elsa are hoping to rely on renewable energy sources as much as possible. The roof is now almost completely covered with rectangular solar panels, which will provide plenty of electricity during the hotter months.
