After Stephen passed, the band really changed. It wasn\u2019t the same band anymore, things changed.\n\n\u2018We thought it was the right to come back, make another album and continue on. [But] it just felt different. The chemistry between us was different.\n\n\u2018What was special was, when the four of us were together, we felt he was in the room and on the stage with us. We didn\u2019t want that to go away so we kept that going.\n\nStephen died in 2009, following a heart defect (Picture: Getty)\n\nStephen\u2019s bandmates still feel him on stage with them (Picture: Getty)\n\nWhile Keith agreed that their Thank You And Goodnight offering was the \u2018best\u2019 way to call time on things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the best work we\u2019ve ever done\u2026,\u2019 he said. \u2018Without Stevo it\u2019s the best work we ever did.
