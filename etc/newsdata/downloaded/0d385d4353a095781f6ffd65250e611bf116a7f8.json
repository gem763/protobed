Since then there have been several other unsuccessful attempts at vandalising the painting.\n\nVincent Delieuvin, curator of 16th-century Italian art at the museum, told Reuters Television that glass technology has improved significantly in recent years and the painting's previous 15-year old bullet-proof glass no longer gave the best possible viewing experience.\n\n\"Today, the Mona Lisa is behind extremely transparent glass, which really gives the impression of being very close to the painting,\" Delieuvin said.\n\nOn Oct. 24, the Louvre will open an exhibition celebrating the works of Leonardo da Vinci to mark the 500th anniversary of his death.\n\nThe exhibition will feature nearly 120 pieces, including paintings, drawings, sculptures and manuscripts from European and American institutions, but not the \"Mona Lisa\" which will remain in its dedicated room in the Louvre's Denon wing.
