Her fiancee, Prof Rifaat al-Amin was given a one-year sentence for alleged complicity.\n\nDr Mohammed Jamal Belkeziz, accused of performing the abortion, was sentenced to two years in prison.\n\nRaissouni previously described the charges as \u201cfabricated\u201d, in a letter from prison. The defendants maintain that the abortion never took place, and that Raissouni was targeted by the Moroccan authorities for her work with the independent Moroccan outlet Akhbar al Yaoum, where she won praise for her coverage of unrest in the country\u2019s north.\n\nProtest held outside trial of Moroccan journalist accused of illegal abortion Read more\n\nRaissouni\u2019s lawyer, Muhammad Sadkou, branded the verdict \u201cregressive\u201d. He added that the judge\u2019s decision meant that the Moroccan state\u2019s claims to respect international conventions guaranteeing rights and freedoms were \u201clies that have nothing to do with reality.\u201d\n\nRaissouni was arrested outside a clinic in Rabat along with her fiance on 31 August. Plainclothes police interrogated the 28-year-old, before detaining Belkeziz and two medical staff who said they had performed an emergency procedure on Raissouni to remove a blood clot. The journalist was then forced to submit to a gynaecological examination.\n\nHer supporters and observers say that her arrest, interrogation and trial represent a state-led effort to publicly shame Raissouni and dissuade others from similar criticism. The lawyer for Belkeziz later provided medical evidence to the court to demonstrate that Raissouni never underwent an abortion.\n\nObservers maintained that the charges against Raissouni were fabricated. TrialWatch, a subset of the Clooney Foundation for Justice which monitored Raissouni\u2019s trial, said that it bore \u201cthe hallmarks of an unfair and punitive process\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe evidence did not sustain the charges,\u201d it said. \u201cThe defence asserted that blood tests revealed that the levels of pregnancy hormone in the defendant\u2019s blood were so low that it would have been impossible for her to be eight weeks pregnant as the police\u2019s doctor claimed.\u201d\n\nCampaigners report that up to 800 abortions are performed daily in the north African country, where abortion is illegal except when the woman\u2019s life is threatened due to pregnancy and with a husband\u2019s permission. Prosecutions are rare, but charges involving a person\u2019s personal life are sometimes used by the Moroccan authorities to push back on individuals seen as too critical, including journalists and members of the political opposition.\n\nMorocco ranks 135 out of 180 countries for press freedom on Reporters Sans Fronti\u00e8res World Press Freedom Index, which says the Moroccan authorities frequently use the courts to harass reporters \u2013 including those who covered unrest in the country\u2019s north Rif region.\n\n\u201cThis is a blow to women\u2019s rights in Morocco,\u201d said Raouia Briki, Amnesty International\u2019s campaigner on Morocco. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign that reforms to the regressive abortion law and the law which criminalises sex outside marriage are urgent.\u201d\n\nLoubna Rais of the Moroccan feminist collective Masaktach, said that Raissouni\u2019s sentence was proof of a lack of fundamental rights in the country.\n\n\u201cWomen in particular, who are the most vulnerable to this kind of unjust persecution, are fighting for basic individual freedoms, the right to their bodies and private lives,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSentencing the doctor to two years and Hajar to one, it\u2019s clear that the authorities would like us to think this whole trial is about an illegal abortion. But we are all well aware that this was just the pretext to silence a journalist\u2019s right to free speech and a woman\u2019s right to her own life and body, even if her connections appear threatening to political interests.\u201d", "description": "Critics say Hajar Raissouni\u2019s one-year sentence is a crackdown on criticism government", "authors": ["Ruth Michaelson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/669d8ab69a2d3e613836c353b26978c7f21ed016/0_272_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8861d5f1a40cb8b14f113e427ce7d76e", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
