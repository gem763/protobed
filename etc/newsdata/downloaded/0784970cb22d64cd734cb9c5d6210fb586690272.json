Happ.\n\nCorrea watched the ball sail, then held up one finger as he rounded the bases. As he approached home plate, he tossed his helmet as if shooting a basketball at the crowd of teammates waiting for him.\n\nGame 3 is Tuesday afternoon at Yankee Stadium. Gerrit Cole, who is 18-0 in his last 24 starts and led the majors in strikeouts, starts for the Astros against Luis Severino.", "description": "Carlos Correa hit a leadoff home run in the 11th inning and the Houston Astros won a battle of the bullpens, beating the New York Yankees 3-2 Sunday night to tie the AL Championship Series at one game apiece.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5320318.1571030011!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/astros-yankees-101319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
