They took 70 samples from the cave's speleothems \u2014 mineral deposits that form on stalagmites and stalactites \u2014 found between 74 feet and 105 feet (22.5 and 32 meters) above modern sea levels.\n\nThough the cave is located 330 feet (100 meters) from the coastline, analysis of the deposits suggests they were formed from oceanic buildup over the years as sea levels rose, flooding the cave between 3 and 4 million years ago.\n\nA close-up of a bulbous stalactite in Art\u00e0 Cave in the western Mediterranean. University of New Mexico\n\n\"Sea level changes at Art\u00e0 Cave can be caused by the melting and growing of ice sheets or by uplift or subsidence of the island itself,\" lead author of the new study Jacky Austermann said in a press release.\n\nThe last time carbon-dioxide levels were as high as they are now\n\nSea levels rose during an era known as the mid-Piacenzian Warm Period, between 3.2 and 3.0 million years ago, when temperatures were 2 degrees Celsius to 3 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than pre-industrial levels. That era was \"the last time the Earth's atmospheric carbon dioxide was as high as today...\" another study author, Bogdan Onac, added.\n\nDuring that time, average global sea levels were as high as 16.2 meters (53 feet) above present.\n\nThe data can help to inform what our planet may look like as increasing temperatures and melting ice caps contribute to global sea-level rise. Reconstructing ice sheet and sea-level changes from the past when the climate was warmer than now provides insight for future predictions.\n\n\"We can use knowledge gained from past warm periods to tune ice sheet models that are then used to predict future ice sheet response to current global warming,\" another study author Bogdan Onac added.\n\nEven if atmospheric carbon dioxide stabilizes at current levels, the authors note that global sea levels will probably still rise to previously seen levels, if not higher. The data indicate that ice sheets are \"very sensitive\" to warming and provide important calibration targets for future ice sheet models.\n\nA view down the Ilulissat Fjord, toward the terminus where Jakobshavn Isbrae rapidly discharges ice to the ocean.
