Who is Hispanic here?\u201d Trump asked the crowd during his wide-ranging address, prompting cheers and applause. Several people in the audience waved \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d placards and donned T-shirts emblazoned with the same message.\n\n\u201cThank you \u2015 incredible people,\u201d Trump said of his Latino supporters.\n\n\u201cYesterday marked the beginning of Hispanic Heritage Month\u2026 we have much to celebrate.\u201d -@realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/01dzVGdT4t \u2014 GOP (@GOP) September 17, 2019\n\nTrump touted the low employment rate and rising median income among Hispanic Americans and said his administration was \u201cworking night and day to deliver a future of limitless opportunity for our nation\u2019s Hispanic American citizens, including many extraordinary Mexican Americans.\u201d\n\nTrump also claimed Hispanic Americans were big fans of his tough immigration policies, including his border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cThe Hispanic Americans understand they don\u2019t want criminals going across the border, they don\u2019t want people taking their jobs, they want to have that security and they want the wall,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey want the wall.\u201d\n\nIn one viral moment, the president singled out one of his supporters \u2015 Steve Cortes, a political commentator on CNN, who was at the event\ufeff.\n\n\u201cHe happens to be Hispanic but I\u2019ve never quite figured it out because he looks more like a WASP than I do,\u201d Trump said of Cortes, using the abbreviation for a \u201cwhite Anglo-Saxon Protestant.\u201d\n\nThe president then asked Cortes: \u201cWho do you like more \u2015 the country or the Hispanics?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says the country,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I may have to go for the Hispanics, to be honest. We got a lot of Hispanics. We love our Hispanics! Get out and vote.\u201d\n\nTrump remarks on how white Steve Cortes looks for being Hispanic, then bizarrely asks him, \"Who do like more -- the country or the Hispanics? He says the country ... I may have to go for the Hispanics to be honest ... we love our Hispanics.\" #wut pic.twitter.com/W37pDuKL12 \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 17, 2019\n\nRecent polls show that Trump \u2014 who has drawn scrutiny in the past for his racist rhetoric against Mexicans and Latin Americans more broadly \u2014 is faring poorly when it comes to Hispanic voters.\n\nA Washington Post-ABC News poll last week found that only 25% of Hispanics approve of the job Trump is doing as president \u2015 considerably lower than his overall approval rating of 38%. A CNN/SSRS poll, also conducted last week, showed Trump\u2019s approval rating among Hispanic adults to be 29%.\n\nHispanic Americans are the largest minority in the United States \u2014 and New Mexico, which is almost half Hispanic, has the largest Hispanic population by percentage of any state.\n\nTrump said during Monday\u2019s rally that he was confident he could drum up enough support to \u201cwin the great state of New Mexico.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged, however, that \u201cit\u2019s been quite a while since a Republican won this state.\u201d\n\nNew Mexico has voted for a Republican president only once since 1992. George W. Bush narrowly bested Democrat John Kerry in the state during the 2004 presidential race; Bush beat Kerry by less than 6,000 votes.\n\nIn 2016, Trump was defeated in New Mexico by Hillary Clinton 40% to 48%; and according to Democrats in the state, the president will have little chance of changing his fortunes in 2020.\n\n\u201cNew Mexicans certainly don\u2019t approve of pulling families apart or putting kids in cages,\u201d New Mexico Democratic Party Chairwoman Marg Elliston told The Washington Post this week. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for leadership that celebrates our immigrant communities, not demonizes them.\u201d", "description": "Polls show Trump \u2014 who's been scrutinized for his hardline immigration stance and racist rhetoric against Latinos \u2014 faring poorly among Hispanics.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d808a99240000d3267bf5de.jpeg?cache=ik7qdj4vct&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
