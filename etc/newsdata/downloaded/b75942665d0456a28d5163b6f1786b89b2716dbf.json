On Wednesday, a coalition of 161 manufacturers, farmers, retailers, natural gas and oil companies as well as other business groups, sent a letter asking Trump to postpone tariff rate increases on Chinese goods slated to take effect this year. More businesses and farmers say they are suffering amid the U.S.-China trade war, as the Wall Street Journal writes, with Best Buy Co. BBY, +0.25% among the latest firms to warn of the impact of tariffs.\n\nThe U.S. government will begin collecting 15% tariffs on $112 billion in Chinese imports beginning Sunday. The Associated Press says when the tariffs kick in, 69% of the consumer goods Americans buy from China will face import taxes, up from 29% now. China\u2019s retaliatory measures take effect the same day.\n\nSaying \u201cwe don\u2019t have a tariff problem,\u201d Trump went back to his regular criticism of the Federal Reserve, pressing the central bank to more aggressively cut interest rates. \u201cIf the Fed would cut, we would have one of the biggest Stock Market increases in a long time,\u201d the president claimed.\n\nU.S. stocks DJIA, +0.16% SPX, +0.06% COMP, -0.13% ended mostly higher on the final trading day of August, which saw volatile action driven by trade and global growth concerns.\n\nNow read: China trade war drags consumer sentiment down to the lowest level in four years.\n\nHURRICANE READINESS\n\nTrump and Vice President Mike Pence were briefed by Federal Emergency Management Agency and other officials on the potential impact of Hurricane Dorian, which is gathering strength and could slam Florida as soon as Monday as a Category 4 storm.\n\nTrump approved an emergency declaration for Florida, authorizing FEMA to coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide assistance for emergency measures.\n\nNow read: Ex-Canadian leader said in now-deleted tweet she hopes Hurricane Dorian makes \u2018direct hit\u2019 on Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAlso see: Here\u2019s the science behind hurricane forecasts and calls to evacuate.\n\nIRAN ROCKET LAUNCH\n\nTrump tweeted a photo of what he said was the site of a failed rocket launch by Iran, and said the U.S. was \u201cnot involved.\u201d\n\nReuters reported that an Iranian official said the rocket exploded on a launch pad in northern Iran on Thursday. A U.S. official separately said Iran suffered a satellite launch failure. The U.S. has warned Iran against rocket launches over fears that technology could ultimately be used to launch nuclear warheads, as Reuters says.\n\nTrump said he wished Iran luck in determining what went wrong.\n\nSign up for Trump Today and more MarketWatch newsletters.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Friday took a slap at what he called badly run companies, saying there isn\u2019t a problem with tariffs as a new round of levies on...", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HN791_trump__ZG_20190719144240.jpg"}
