REUTERS/Steve Marcus\n\nWhile polls show the former vice president trailing in other early voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, South Carolina - with its sizable African-American population - remains one place where Biden holds an undeniable advantage.\n\nBut sensing potential weakness, Biden\u2019s rivals from liberal standard-bearers Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to moderate challengers such as Pete Buttigieg to black senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker are all looking to take that away.\n\nAfrican-American support will be crucial to win the party\u2019s presidential nomination. With black voters comprising two-thirds of the Democratic electorate in South Carolina, the state offers the first major test of candidates\u2019 strength with the key voting block.\n\nThe most recent poll in the state by Winthrop University had Biden taking 46 percent of the black Democratic electorate, but also showed that 44 percent might change their mind before the state\u2019s primary on Feb. 29.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting calls from people who are Biden supporters who now want to hedge their bet and support somebody they think can actually win,\u201d U.S. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who has made South Carolina central to his presidential bid, told reporters in Washington this week.\n\nDefeating Biden in the state will not come easy. Polls have him averaging more than a 20-point lead over the rest of the field, while more than 85 legislators and pastors have endorsed him, dwarfing endorsements for any of his rivals.\n\nBolstered by the eight years he served as No. 2 to Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, Biden has deep roots with black politicians and clergy in the state and nationally.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s familiar,\u201d said Joe Darby, senior pastor at African Methodist Church in Charleston, who added that Biden has spoken at his church banquet several times. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t wait until an election year to show his face.\u201d\n\nBiden, Warren, Sanders and seven other Democratic presidential contenders will head to South Carolina this weekend to present their criminal justice plans at the historically black Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nWIN EARLY\n\nMost of Biden\u2019s rivals are starting from scratch in the state.\n\nBut they are all betting a stronger-than-expected showing in Iowa, the state that will kick off the nominating contest in February, will win them a hard look in South Carolina, just as Obama\u2019s 2008 performance in Iowa helped draw black voters away from presumed front-runner Hillary Clinton in later contests.\n\nSouth Carolina is the fourth contest on the Democratic calendar, coming after Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.\n\nOlder black voters, who are among the most reliable in the party, tend be more pragmatic than white progressives, focusing less on policy and more on whether a candidate can be successful, said Theodore Johnson, an expert on race and politics at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\n\u201cYou have to prove you can win white voters,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cbecause that proves you can win the general election.\u201d\n\nThat may part of the calculation of Warren, who has made fewer trips to South Carolina than Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nThough she has struggled to add black voters to her expanding base of support among women, college-educated whites and young people, Warren\u2019s campaign believes her populist focus on income inequality and structural change can help her eventually resonate.\n\nWarren has also been the candidate running the most Facebook ads that mention variations of the words \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cAfrican American\u201d since May, according to a Reuters analysis of ad data gathered by the Online Political Ads Transparency Project.\n\nThe ads have focused on Warren\u2019s pledge to make public college tuition-free and restore historically black colleges and universities.\n\nWarren\u2019s progressive rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, meanwhile has concentrated on criminal justice reform, said Michael Wukela, the campaign\u2019s communications director in South Carolina. Sanders wants to ban for-profit prisons, abolish the death penalty and tighten rules and penalties for police misconduct.\n\nSince he is more popular with younger voters, his campaign also hopes to motivate those voters to speak to their older relatives, Wukela said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just saying we need you to show up on election day. It\u2019s saying we need you to show up on Thanksgiving, when you\u2019re back home.\u201d\n\nRURAL VISITS, FAITH APPEAL\n\nBlack support has been also elusive for Booker and Harris, both black politicians. Both have made visiting rural black communities a key to their strategy and visited the state more than any major candidate in the field.\n\nHarris\u2019 campaign believes she is well positioned to pick up many of Biden\u2019s supporters should his campaign falter, said a campaign aide who requested anonymity to speak frankly.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris doesn\u2019t need to be told what the concerns of the black community are,\u201d the aide said.\n\nLike Biden, both have hired faith coordinators to connect with local pastors, who act as campaign conduits to their congregations.\n\nAaron Bishop, a pastor who is overseeing Booker\u2019s faith outreach program, said Booker\u2019s embrace of his own faith \u2013 including his use of scripture when speaking during Sunday services \u2013 has brought him new supporters every time he has appeared at a church gathering.\n\nButtigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, may face the toughest uphill path among the top-tier Democratic contenders in the state.\n\nButtigieg has clashed with black activists in South Bend over economic and law enforcement issues, and a senior campaign aide acknowledged that some churchgoing African-Americans in South Carolina are uncomfortable with the fact that Buttigieg is openly gay and has a husband.\n\nOnly 56% of African-Americans said they have a favorable view of Buttigieg in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, compared to 78% for Sanders, 76% for Biden, and 68% for Warren. That represented the lowest favorability rating among top 10 Democratic candidates, though it is still higher than Trump\u2019s 23% favorability among black voters.\n\nButtigieg is counting on success in Iowa and New Hampshire to persuade those voters to give him a second look, the aide said.\n\nUltimately, the race for black voters may come down to electability, said Darby, the Charleston pastor and Biden supporter who urged candidates to talk less about sweeping proposals and more about how they would beat Trump next year.\n\nAccording to a Oct.18-22 Reuters/Ipsos poll, 18% of African Americans approve of Trump\u2019s performance, while 76% disapprove.\n\n\u201cI appreciate good policy position,\u201d Darby said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t redecorate the house while the house is blazing.\u201d", "description": "With each passing day, South Carolina looms larger as perhaps Joe Biden\u2019s last line of defense if he hopes to secure the Democratic presidential nomination next year.", "authors": ["James Oliphant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444839208&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O0MU", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
