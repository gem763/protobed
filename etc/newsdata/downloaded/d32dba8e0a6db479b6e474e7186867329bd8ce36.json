So there\u2019s work to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it would be wrong of me to give a running commentary on the negotiations,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWith the greatest possible respect I think, look at everything I\u2019ve said previously.\n\n\"I think you can draw your own conclusions from that. But let\u2019s our negotiators get on.\u201d\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\u201cI can certainly tell you that under no circumstances will we see anything that damages the ability of the whole of the United Kingdom to take full advantage of Brexit, and I think that\u2019s what people would expect, and that\u2019s what I think we can achieve.\u201d\n\nEurope's chief negotiator has been given the go-ahead by ambassadors from the EU's 27 member states to enter the final stage - known as 'tunnel negotiations' - with the UK to strike a Brexit deal.\n\nAfter a meeting with Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay, Mr Barnier briefed representatives of the EU member states who gave the green light for negotiations to be stepped up.\n\n\"It's a tunnel with a very small light at the end of it,\" one of the diplomats said, indicating there was not too much hope on the EU side that a divorce deal could be sealed before Britain is due to leave the EU on Oct. 31.\n\nBut it represents a major breakthrough in the negotiations - which just a few days ago were floundering, leading Downing St sources to brief that a deal was \"impossible\".\n\nThe announcement came after earliier this morning Mr Barnier met with Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay, in what the UK described as \"a constructive meeting\".\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMr Barnier added that \"Brexit is like climbing a big mountain, we need vigilance, determination and patience\".\n\nDespite the breakthrough just a few hours earlier European Council President Donald Tusk said Britain's offer still isn't workable but that there were \"promising signals\" that parties could secure a deal - after the Irish PM threw Boris Johnson's government a lifeline in private talks yesterday.\n\nMr Tusk said he had received a positive message from Leo Varadkar that a deal was \"still possible\" after the meeting yesterday.\n\nIn a tweet he said: \"The UK has still not come forward with a workable, realistic proposal.\n\n\"But I have received promising signals from Taoiseach @LeoVaradkar that a deal is possible\n\n\"Even the slightest chance must be used. A no deal Brexit will never be the choice of the EU.\"\n\nYesterday, the Irish PM and Mr Johnson declared they could \"see a pathway\" to a possible agreement.", "description": "Asked twice Mr Johnson refused to guarantee that N.I will leave on the same terms as the rest of the UK - setting up potential conflict with the DWP and hardline Brexiteer Tories", "authors": ["Oliver Milne", "Image", "Getty Images", "Reuters", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20561261.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_British-PM-Announces-Funding-Commitments-For-UK-Schools.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
