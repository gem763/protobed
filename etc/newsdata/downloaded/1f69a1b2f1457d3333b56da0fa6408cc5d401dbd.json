Happily, the actor, who began his career at the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he starred in productions such as \u2019Tis Pity She\u2019s A Whore, passed the vetting process.\n\nHis new duties promise to be varied. \u2018They would include things like [attending] citizenship ceremonies,\u2019 says Legrave, who explains that West Sussex\u2019s Deputy Lieutenants are involved in \u2018quite a lot of discreet work, as well as official engagements\u2019. Bonneville, 55, moved to Stedham, a village on the Sussex Downs, about 20 years ago, before screen success in Iris and Notting Hill enabled him to buy what one friend described as \u2018a much bigger house tucked away in the hills\u2019 nearby.\n\nThe actor declines to comment on his latest advance up the ranks of West Sussex society, but has regularly spoken of his love for the county.\n\nHe proposed to his wife, Lulu \u2014with whom he has one son, Felix \u2014 on Harting Down and has declared that he wishes his ashes to be buried there.\n\nThere are perhaps just two drawbacks to the Deputy Lieutenant\u2019s role. Unlike that of Lord-Lieutenant, it does not come with a uniform, \u2018just a badge of office,\u2019 explains Legrave.\n\nAnd from time to time they\u2019re required to greet dignitaries arriving at Gatwick airport. Will Bonneville require Carson to deputise for him instead?\n\nMamma Mia! Carrie's the new No.10 Dancing Queen\n\nWhile Boris Johnson\u2019s reputed former lover, Jennifer Arcuri, told ITV viewers that he had asked her \u2018to show him a few things\u2019 on the dancing pole at her London flat, the Prime Minister\u2019s current girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, prefers more restrained jiving.\n\nI can reveal that Carrie, 31, escaped No 10 Downing Street on Monday night to attend Mamma Mia! The Party at the O2.\n\nAs my exclusive picture illustrates, she joined in as the audience danced at the end of the musical. Carrie wore a cream sweater with the slogan Disco Paris, a green Alice band and an emerald polka dot skirt.\n\nWhile Boris Johnson\u2019s reputed former lover, Jennifer Arcuri, told ITV viewers that he had asked her \u2018to show him a few things\u2019 on the dancing pole at her London flat, the Prime Minister\u2019s current girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, prefers more restrained jiving\n\n\u2018She was in the heart of the action with a group of friends,\u2019 a fellow guest tells me.\n\n\u2018At first she seemed quiet and subdued, and was checking her phone constantly, but, by the end of the night, she looked like she was having the time of her life.\n\n\u2018She was on her feet, waving her arms and singing along to Take A Chance On Me.\u2019\n\nSir Trevor drops in on a singing Nunn\n\nTheatre director Sir Trevor Nunn proved himself a devoted father this week when he attended his daughter\u2019s show in London.\n\nEllie, 28, whose mother is Trevor\u2019s ex-wife, actress Imogen Stubbs, was giving her one-woman performance, Ellie Sings Songs At People, at The Other Palace in St James\u2019s.\n\n\u2018This is the first time he\u2019s been able to come to one of these. This means everything to me,\u2019 she says, posting a picture of herself with her dad (above).\n\nIt comes after Ellie admitted she was struggling with anxiety about the production, dedicated to her love of composer Stephen Sondheim.\n\nTheatre director Sir Trevor Nunn proved himself a devoted father this week when he attended his daughter\u2019s show in London.

Now her daughter, Tali, is giving her a run for her money.\n\nThe 26-year-old artist posed for a portrait to be shown in Hotel Chelsea in New York \u2014 the city where she now lives \u2014 wearing a lively burlesque costume. Topping it off with an extravagant pink jewelled headpiece, she captions it: \u2018Ran away to the circus.\u2019\n\nHer mother, who resides in West London, responds in jest: \u2018There\u2019s always a room and a cup of tea whenever you decide to come back.\u2019\n\nEurythmics singer Annie Lennox was an Eighties fashion icon.

Her new book, Stoned, about her life on the road with the band, had to be given pre-publication approval by her ex.\n\n\u2018I had to show Ronnie everything I was using so he could check it was OK for the public to see first,\u2019 Jo told me at her artist brother Paul Karslake\u2019s new show, Bank Robbery, at Soho\u2019s Groucho Club. \u2018He was very good and in the end only censored one thing \u2014 a letter to the tax man about a big bill.\u2019\n\nThere was a great assembly of Thatcherites for the launch of Charles Moore\u2019s final volume of the biography of Mrs T, but the Iron Lady might have baulked at the wine served at Whitehall\u2019s Banqueting House: it was from Argentina.\n\nMoore noted the party was in the room Charles I walked through before being beheaded.
