(Life was so different then: Instagram was less than a month old, Meghan Markle was perhaps best known as \u201cRandom Girl\u201d on an episode of The League, and Donald Trump\u2019s biggest headline was crowning Poison singer Bret Michaels as the winner of Celebrity Apprentice.) In other ways, though, it feels like we\u2019ve spent approximately 137 years watching these survivors make very little progress toward building a livable society that isn\u2019t constantly threatened by gut munchers, and worse, by some really sick, sadistic people. Yet they, and we, march on. Even at Oceanside, the livin\u2019 ain\u2019t easy \u2014 zombies lurk and the human threats, specifically a bald one, loom large. While tonight\u2019s episode sets up a number of compelling questions for what lies ahead, perhaps the biggest one is this: Will the continuation of the Whisperers storyline and the loss of more key characters keep things interesting, or has the show jumped the undead shark?\n\nKicking things off with a Russian satellite tumbling through space is a surprisingly fresh way to start, though I admit feeling a bit let down by its significance in the end. My thoughts on seeing it: Is help coming from, of all places, Moscow? Is space tech the secret project that Maggie and Georgie are working on? Did Rick end up at the International Space Station? Is this all taking place on some alternate Earth? Turns out the answer to all of the above is no (I think) and the truth is instead something pretty mundane: The satellite happens to crash near Oceanside, sparking a forest fire that compels the survivors to cross into Whisperer territory, something they haven\u2019t done since Alpha put poor Henry\u2019s head and a few others on spikes.\n\nSomething else that\u2019s new in this episode is the chapter titles, and after that brief prologue courtesy of the Kremlin, it\u2019s time for \u201cTraining Day,\u201d featuring Aaron and Michonne leading a battalion across the beach to practice killing waterlogged ooze-walkers. Highlights include Judith keeping it sassy, and a slow-mo triple head slice courtesy of Michonne that looks like a cross between a video game cut scene and a piece of cinematic art. She tops that by hacking the face of a zombie clean off like a thick cut of deli meat on a slicer. It\u2019s reassuring to see that after all these years, some things \u2014 i.e., creative walker kills \u2014 really don\u2019t change.\n\nBut for all the fun zombie butchery and hearing Aaron very seriously bark commands like \u201cHalt! Archers!,\u201d everyone\u2019s still cowering in the long, dark shadow of Alpha. They\u2019re so terrified of her literal lines in the sand that when the kids find a skin mask on the beach, it sends Aaron into a fury and the other leaders begin debating caution versus action. On a recon mission, Aaron gets a tough-guy moment in which he unwisely takes on three walkers for no good reason at all. \u201cI\u2019m goddamn sick of being nice,\u201d he says, and he\u2019s not alone \u2014 I think the word \u201cshit\u201d was dropped three times in total and Michonne nearly spit out an F-bomb at Aaron\u2019s stupidity.\n\nHard to blame the one-handed man for his rage \u2014 he lost his beau and a lot of friends, and he\u2019s joined the ranks of the Single Parents Club with Michonne and Rosita. Let\u2019s pause to consider the latter\u2019s bizarre situation, which is less a love triangle and more of a heavylike rhombus. She\u2019s got Saddiq\u2019s baby, she\u2019s hooked up with Gabe, and torch-carrying Eugene seems to be doing most of the childcare while she kickboxes and Saddiq suffers from survivor\u2019s remorse PTSD. (Eugene\u2019s payment for his services, apparently: creepy breastfeeding boob glances.) I also would like to know what in the hell is up with Dante, the new doctor who less than half jokingly says he and Saddiq are basically gods in this world. Can\u2019t have enough white coats around, but I wonder if Saddiq\u2019s days could be numbered.\n\nSpeaking of messy semi-romantic situations, we learn that Carol\u2019s become a \u201csea dog\u201d in the time since she split from Zeke and saw her adopted son\u2019s head on a stick. (Finally, a smart move \u2014 best to keep Carol away from the kids, people.) When her boat docks at Oceanside, Zeke could not be more awkward, while Carol can\u2019t be less interested; surely the former king is a reminder of their dead son, but c\u2019mon Carol, show the guy a little love! By contrast, she\u2019s giddy at the sight of Daryl and wastes no time hopping on his hog for a walker-and-wild-animal hunting trip. There\u2019s a slightly different, fun chemistry between them during the \u201cbest friends\u201d scene \u2014 Daryl is open and warm, Carol\u2019s the smartass. They\u2019re fully genuine and unguarded with each other. But for anyone pining for these two, I have one word for you: Connie. Daryl is learning sign language for her, people! Make this happen, TWD! When Connie\u2019s sister admits she\u2019s losing her hearing, too, Connie\u2019s response \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s not a disability \u2026 it\u2019s a damn superpower!\u201d \u2014 is just perfect.\n\nLast season, it seemed like Daryl might become a single parent himself, given the way he bonded with Lydia. But that\u2019s on hold for now while the teenager struggles to learn to read and practices her b\u014d-staff skills. Lydia also raps with good ol\u2019 Negan, who enjoys his farming work-release program and giving Gabe some backhanded tips for leadership in the Whisperers Era. (Best line from his Ted Talk to the priest: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just nestle in below me and let me baby-bird a little bit of my wisdom into that pretty mouth of yours.\u201d Runner up: \u201cPeople are putting their shitting pants back on \u2026 because pants-shitting is definitely happening.\u201d)\n\nNegan\u2019s actually a solid source for help on how to topple a psychopathic warlord, and that\u2019s advice they\u2019ll soon need. (I really hope he faces off with Alpha and we\u2019re treated to a verbal battle between her slow drawl and his elaborate, dirty wordplay.) The Russian tin-can crashing in the woods sparks a huge blaze, forcing the survivors to enter Alpha\u2019s land to extinguish it. That leads to a few notable moments: Zeke in respiratory distress, Carol using the ol\u2019 Colombian Necktie move as a creative way to douse the flames, and Eugene stripping the satellite for tech that will undoubtedly not change their lives in any meaningful way.\n\nSwear-we\u2019re-just-friends besties Daryl and Carol slip away to enjoy a scenic view and debate running away to New Mexico. Maybe that would be for the best option for Carol\u2014especially since she can\u2019t spend 24 hours on dry land without locking eyes with Alpha and making it quite clear that there\u2019s done been some tresspassin\u2019. Alpha \u2014 in all her Apocalypse Now cosplay glory \u2014 gives Carol a look that twists from shock to fury. Better keep practicing those battle formations, folks.", "description": "Even at Oceanside, the livin\u2019 ain\u2019t easy.
