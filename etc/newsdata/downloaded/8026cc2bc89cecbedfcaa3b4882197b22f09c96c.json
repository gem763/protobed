Brands that create compelling campaigns on trusted platforms can both avoid brand-safety issues and also receive more positive engagement from audiences.\n\nIn the third annual Digital Trust Report from Business Insider Intelligence, our respondents are more receptive to ads and sponsored content on platforms that have high digital trust.\n\nAcross the four pillars of trust that we assessed (Security, Legitimacy, Community, and Relevance), a majority of respondents indicated that each has a moderate to very high impact on whether they engage with an ad: 75% said so for Legitimacy (whether a platform shows them deceptive content); 72% for Community (whether a platform makes them feel safe to use); 69% for Security (whether a platform protects their privacy and data); and 63% for Relevance (whether a platform shows them relevant ads).\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence's 2019 Digital Trust Report, our latest Enterprise Edge Report, evaluates consumer perception of social networks, and uses those perceptions to rank the platforms on digital trustworthiness across six pillars: Security, Legitimacy, Community, User Experience, Shareability, and Relevance.\n\nFor this year's ranking, we surveyed 1,974 members of Business Insider's proprietary panel to gauge how perceptions of digital trustworthiness differ among seven of the largest social platforms: Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, Snapchat, and Pinterest. The full report analyzes key changes in rankings from 2018 and 2017.\n\nRespondents to our Digital Trust Survey are social media users and tend to be younger, male, affluent, North American, and early tech adopters. In other words, they're people who pay attention to new developments with tech platforms, and who also have money to spend based on the ads they view. To that end, we view our data as both a leading indicator of the state of trust in digital platforms as well as a concrete measure of sentiment among a valuable segment of the population.\n\nThe six pillars in Business Insider Intelligence's model of digital trust are:\n\nSecurity \u2014 Q: How confident are you that the following social platforms are protecting your privacy and data? Legitimacy \u2014 Q: How likely are the following platforms to show you deceptive content like fake news, scams, or clickbait? Community \u2014 Q: How safe do you feel participating in or posting on the following social platforms? User Experience \u2014 Q: Which platform has the most annoying ads? Shareability \u2014 Q: On which platform are you most likely to share content you come across? Relevance \u2014 Q: How likely are the following platforms to show you ads/sponsored content that are relevant to you?\n\nHere are a few key takeaways from the report:\n\nLinkedIn was the most-trusted platform among respondents for the third year in a row. LinkedIn held the top spot in three out of our six pillars, and second place in the remaining three \u2014 Shareability, User Experience, and Relevance.\n\nLinkedIn held the top spot in three out of our six pillars, and second place in the remaining three \u2014 Shareability, User Experience, and Relevance. Facebook performed worse across every pillar after another damaging year for its public image. For example, on the Security pillar, more than four in five (81%) of respondents who were also Facebook users said they were only slightly or not at all confident in the platform to protect their privacy and data, compared with 79% who said so last year.\n\nFor example, on the Security pillar, more than four in five (81%) of respondents who were also Facebook users said they were only slightly or not at all confident in the platform to protect their privacy and data, compared with 79% who said so last year. Facebook's lead on Shareability is shrinking, while Instagram surpassed Twitter to rank third. This year, 33% of respondents who use Facebook said Facebook is where they were most likely to share content, down from 39% who said the same last year. Meanwhile, Instagram saw a healthy jump: 17% of respondents who use Instagram said it is the platform on which they are most likely to share content, up from 10% in 2018.\n\nThis year, 33% of respondents who use Facebook said Facebook is where they were most likely to share content, down from 39% who said the same last year.
