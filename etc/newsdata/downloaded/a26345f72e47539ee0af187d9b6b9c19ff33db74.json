But text messages from a phone number belonging to Wohl suggest that the 21-year-old hoaxer has branched out into making death threats on behalf of his political allies, telling one woman he would \u201ctorture you so much that you end up killing yourself.\u201d\n\nAug. 1 was a big day for both allies and former friends of Omar Navarro, a Republican known for his perennial failed campaigns against Donald Trump nemesis Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA). Those runs had earned him more than $1 million in campaign donations in his 2018 run, and high-powered endorsements from Trumpworld stalwarts like Herman Cain, Ret. Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, and game-show host Chuck Woolery. But suddenly his career as a conservative cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre was at risk.\n\nNavarro was due in court in Torrance, California, that day. A judge was due to decide whether his ex-girlfriend\u2014self-styled MAGA relationship expert DeAnna Lorraine Tesoriero\u2014would be granted a restraining order against him after enduring what she describes as months of harassment since dumping him in April.\n\nA restraining order could be disastrous for both Navarro\u2019s fundraising and his already dim electoral chances\u2014he lost his last two races against Waters by more than 50 percentage points. It also wouldn\u2019t be the first time Navarro has been in court on a domestic issue: He was convicted in 2016 of putting an illegal tracking device on his wife\u2019s car.\n\nMaking matters worse, former Navarro campaign worker Irina Chausovskaya had had a falling out with the candidate. She claimed to have secretly obtained recordings of the candidate making crude sexual comments about Waters and planning to invest into bitcoin the campaign funds he received from conservative donors across the country. And Chausovskaya and Tesoriero knew one another, raising the prospect of two damaging stories for Navarro\u2019s career as a perennial candidate breaking at the same time.\n\nShortly before Tesoriero\u2019s court hearing, Chausovskaya received text messages from a number with a 949 area code in Orange County. Whoever was behind the number wanted to know whether Chausovskaya would be at the hearing.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll see you soon,\u201d the text message read. \u201cIt won\u2019t be painful. I\u2019m looking forward to watching your soul leave your eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make it my mission to torture you so much that you end up killing yourself,\u201d the writer of the messages added.\n\nThe text messages were just the latest in a series of threatening text and WhatsApp messages that Chausovskaya and Tesoriero claim to have received over months since angering Navarro.\n\nUsually, the messages came from numbers they had never seen before, sometimes with fake names attached. This time, though, there was a clue as to who was behind the latest round of texts.\n\nA search in the TrueCaller app, which collects phone data from users and phone directories, showed the 949 number was associated with Jacob Wohl. The Daily Beast was able to independently confirm the connection. Calls to the 949 number Wohl has used before that threatened to \u201ctorture\u201d Chausovskaya weren\u2019t answered. But the evidence of Wohl\u2019s involvement matched what Tesoriero says she heard from Navarro campaign worker Sean Daniel.\n\nIn a recording reviewed by The Daily Beast, a man Tesoriero identifies as Daniel tells her that he had talked to Navarro, who had told Daniel he would hire Wohl for $5,000 to \u201cdo something against your career\u201d if she succeeded in getting the restraining order granted.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to investigate and spend money with Jacob Wohl, to have you like get obliterated, because he\u2019s gonna be so pissed because his political career, he said, is gonna be over, if he gets another restraining order,\u201d the man in the recording said. \u201cThat\u2019s what he told me.\u201d\n\nDaniel, who has been paid $11,665.68 this year by Navarro\u2019s campaign for digital marketing services, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn the recording, the man says that Navarro said he would use campaign money to hire Wohl.\n\n\u201cHe raised a lot of money last quarter,\u201d the man in the recording said. \u201cHe says he\u2019s got a lot of money to be able to have people go after you.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no question that Wohl and Navarro know each other. In May, Wohl posted a picture of himself meeting with Navarro in the lobby of the Trump International Hotel in Washington on Instagram.\n\nIn an Instagram direct message to The Daily Beast, Wohl denied being \u201cprivy to anything regarding any congressional candidate\u2019s personal life.\u201d Navarro denied hiring Wohl, and said any text messages provided to The Daily Beast or used in Tesoriero\u2019s application for a restraining order were \u201ctotal fake news.\u201d But the judge found Tesoriero credible and granted her a five-year restraining order against Navarro\u2014the longest option available in California.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in court was not justice,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cIt was basically a judge going off of someone crying in a courtroom.\u201d\n\nNavarro\u2019s political career, such as it is, has grown alongside Waters\u2019 profile as a Trump antagonist. Navarro raised less than $3,000 in his 2016 run against Waters, and lost in a landslide.\n\nHe also went down in defeat in 2018\u2014but in the lead-up to that race, Waters had become a top enemy for Trump supporters, and Navarro\u2019s campaign treasury was filled with donations from Republicans eager to see her out of Congress. Navarro raised more than $1.1 million in the 2018 cycle\u2014$24,583.04 of which he paid to himself as a salary, an unusual but not unprecedented move for a congressional candidate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cash cow, and they don\u2019t want the cash cow to end,\u201d Chausovskaya said.\n\nNavarro\u2019s reputation in the world of right-wing internet personalities began to wane earlier this year, however, when he allegedly began harassing Tesoriero. Navarro had begun going out with Tesoriero, the author of Trump-themed dating guide Making Love Great Again!, earlier this year, while he was still divorcing his wife. By April, though, Tesoriero told him they were done. He didn\u2019t take it well, according to an application for a restraining order that Tesoriero filed in July.\n\n\u201cOmar became very jealous and became obsessed with accusing me of having other romantic relationships,\u201d Tesoriero wrote in the application.\n\nTesoriero\u2019s court filing includes a lengthy list of times Navarro allegedly harassed her after she dumped him, including confronting her at Georgetown\u2019s tony Cafe Milano and following her around the lobby at the Trump International Hotel in Washington in May. As Tesoriero left the hotel with her friends, she claims Navarro followed behind her, yelling, \u201cThat\u2019s my girlfriend!\u201d\n\nLater that day, Tesoriero says she was deluged with text messages calling her a slut and a whore.\n\nTesoriero says Navarro threatened to release details about their sex lives and put out other damaging information about her if she wouldn\u2019t get back together with him. She claims she was forced to stay in contact with him for fear that he would attack her on his Twitter account, which has more than 200,000 followers.\n\n\u201c You seem like a smart girl with a great future... Would be a shame if something happened to you. If you don\u2019t meet with us, we can\u2019t guarantee it won\u2019t. \u201d \u2014 Text message to Irina Chausovskaya\n\n\u201cOmar has approximately 225,000 Twitter followers, many of which are in my social and professional network,\u201d Tesoriero wrote in her request for a temporary restraining order. \u201cTerrified of him, but also fearing he would follow through with his threats (which he eventually did) I remained in contact with him for this reason.\u201d\n\nNavarro\u2019s confrontations with Tesoriero came to a head in early July, when they were both in town to appear at a rally organized by the far-right Proud Boys men\u2019s group. On July 3, Navarro showed up at a downtown Washington bar popular with conservatives, where he began to argue with Tesoriero. After a member of the far-right Proud Boys group got in between the two, Navarro stormed out of the bar, and later accused the group on Twitter of stealing his girlfriend and using cocaine.\n\nMeanwhile, Chausovskaya, who had some secret recordings of the candidate, had begun to criticize how Navarro handled his 2018 campaign. On one recording, Navarro speculates about using his windfall of campaign contributions to invest in bitcoin. In another, he discusses which sex acts he would like to perform on Waters. On another, he complains about Asian-American drivers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem with Torrance, there\u2019s so many Asians right here,\u201d Navarro said on the recording.\n\nThe recordings began to circulate on Telegram, a Russian messaging app that\u2019s become popular with American right-wing activists who have been kicked off of other social-media platforms. Some of the recordings were published on a blog operated by anti-Muslim bigot Milo Yiannopoulos, who had started to attack Navarro after the Proud Boys feud.\n\nChausovskaya began to receive text messages from a number she didn\u2019t know with a 424 area code, in Los Angeles. The man behind the number claimed to be named Joseph Wexler, and said Chausovskaya had \u201charassed, defamed, and stalked\u201d his \u201cclients.\u201d Wexler claimed to have talked to an FBI agent about Chausovskaya, and planned to take \u201cirreversible action\u201d against her. Wexler also accused Chausovskaya of acting as an unlicensed lawyer for Tesoriero.\n\nIn one text message, Wexler said he had visited Chausovskaya\u2019s home\u2014writing out her address to make clear he knew where she lived\u2014but didn\u2019t find her. In another, he said he had gone to a Tucson, Arizona, business operated by her mother.\n\n\u201cYou seem like a smart girl with a great future,\u201d one text message read. \u201cWould be a shame if something happened to you. If you don\u2019t meet with us, we can\u2019t guarantee it won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTesoriero began to receive messages from the same number, including one with a picture of Tesoriero posing for the camera\u2014with the implication that he had more damaging images to come.\n\n\u201cI want to make you famous,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCant wait to do so.\u201d\n\nAround the same time, someone using the same phone number texted The Daily Beast and offered to provide \u201cthe goods\u201d on a number of right-wing personalities\u2014in exchange for a story critical of Chausovskaya.\n\nWhen The Daily Beast called the number, a man who identified himself as \u201cMichael Maas\u201d picked up the phone, and claimed that Wexler was a friend who had been borrowing his phone to make the threats.\n\n\u201cI think this was kind of a douchey move for him to use my phone like that,\u201d the man said.\n\nMaas offered to put The Daily Beast in touch with Wexler, but neither person\u2014if they are two different people\u2014responded to further messages.\n\nDays before the restraining-order hearing, Tesoriero began to receive a series of WhatsApp messages from someone who claimed to be outside her bedroom, even noting when she turned off her lights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting because they are harassing people,\u201d Tesoriero said. \u201cI never asked for any of this.\u201d\n\nUPDATE 12:34 P.M. In a series of emails to The Daily Beast, Wohl denied he had anything to do with harassing Chausovskaya or Tesoriero. Wohl confirmed that the 949 number used to send threatening texts once belonged to him, but he claimed it was \u201can incontrovertible fact that I have not had that 949 phone number\u201d in almost a year.\n\nIn a subsequent message, Wohl said he had the phone disconnected on November 2, 2018 \u2014 a little more than nine months ago, and after his failed attempt to smear Robert Mueller with sexual assault allegations.\n\n\u201cWhat likely happened? Navarro allegedly threatened to deploy me to act against the interests of this woman,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShe then looked up my number in one of those crappy online databases and found my old number to use in photoshopped or otherwise fabricated messages. I\u2019ve never worked for Navarro and have only heard about this woman\u2019s name upon reading the story.\u201d\n\nWohl wrote in another message, \u201cThe 949 number DID NOT belong to me at the time the alleged threat was made. You will retract this bogus story or face legal action.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know how seriously to take Wohl\u2019s words. In June, Wohl admitted to the Washington Post that one of his previous denials to The Daily Beast was, in fact, untrue.", "description": "\u201cI\u2019ll make it my mission to torture you so much that you end up killing yourself,\u201d reads a text message from a phone number belonging to notorious smear merchant Jacob Wohl.", "authors": ["Will Sommer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1565565146/190808-sommer-navarro-wohl-tease_vvmz3a"}
