The Senate voted in September to cancel the declaration by a vote of 54-41, but it\u2019s unlikely the chamber has enough votes to overturn the veto.\n\nTrump vetoed a similar resolution in March, and lawmakers have pledged to vote through such measures every six months, as allowed by law. The president, however, has said the situation along the border remains a national emergency that \u201cthreatens the well-being of vulnerable populations.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has empowered my Administration\u2019s Government-wide strategy to counter large-scale unlawful migration and to respond to corresponding humanitarian challenges through focused application of every Constitutional and statutory authority at our disposal,\u201d Trump wrote in the veto.\n\nHe later went on to praise the construction of the wall itself, claiming the emergency declaration \u201chas also facilitated the military\u2019s ongoing construction of virtually insurmountable physical barriers along hundreds of miles of our southern border.\u201d\n\nThe White House issued the veto on Tuesday evening during the fourth Democratic presidential debate.\n\nTrump first declared the national emergency in February, saying his administration planned to divert $3.6 billion in congressionally appropriated funds from the Defense Department to fund construction efforts. The Pentagon said last month that 127 projects around the globe would be delayed due to the transfer, including projects in nearly half of the 50 states.\n\nThe declaration has prompted widespread fury from lawmakers and a bevy of lawsuits, but the Supreme Court ruled in Trump\u2019s favor in July.\n\n\u201cBig WIN for Border Security and the Rule of Law!\u201d Trump tweeted at the time.\n\nTrump defended his earlier veto in the announcement on Tuesday, saying he rejected the earlier bill \u201cbecause it was a dangerous resolution that would undermine United States sovereignty and threaten the lives and safety of countless Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is similarly my duty, in order to protect the safety and security of our Nation, to return S.J. Res. 54 to the Senate without my approval,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe president has continued to tout his hard-line policy along the southern border while replacing any officials who stand in his way. Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, resigned last week after a tumultuous, six-month tenure in the administration.", "description": "The decision to stop the measure passed by Congress was released amid the fourth Democratic debate.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da6751b210000150e3495f6.jpeg?cache=u1e9lhllci&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
