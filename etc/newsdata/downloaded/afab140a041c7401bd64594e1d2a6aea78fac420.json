It is time to show that support,\u201d Ms. Espinal said in a video statement asking them to visit her at Columbus Mennonite Church, a 15-minute drive from where Democrats are holding their debate in Westerville, Ohio. \u201cCome show your support for my family. I will be here waiting for you.\u201d\n\nThe Mexican woman snuck into the U.S. as a teen in the 1990s and has attempted to claim asylum, but that claim was rejected and she\u2019s been through the immigration court process and had a judge order her deported.\n\nShe now has three U.S. citizen children she says she won\u2019t leave.\n\nShe\u2019s tried to ask U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for a stay of removal, which would allow her to leave the church and return to her previous life despite her unauthorized status, but the agency has rejected those attempts so far while she\u2019s in hiding.\n\nShe drew attention over the summer when she announced ICE had slapped her with a notice of a nearly $500,000 fine for evading deportation.\n\nThe Democratic presidential field has embraced illegal immigrants as a cause, vowing all manner of steps to try to grant most of them legal status.\n\nSome have gone further.\n\nIn the 2016 campaign, Democratic candidates drew attention by meeting with illegal immigrant \u201cDreamers\u201d who were granted reprieves from deportation under the legally challenged Obama-era DACA program.\n\nSen. Bernard Sanders has hired DACA beneficiaries in both his 2016 and 2020 campaigns.\n\nIronically, as illegal immigrants, DACA recipients are not allowed to be paid government workers.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
