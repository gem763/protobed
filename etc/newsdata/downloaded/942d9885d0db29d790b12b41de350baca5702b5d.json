As a player and a coach, his storied career has taken him to four World Cups with England and five tours with the British and Irish Lions.\n\nHis 17-year playing career saw him win 54 caps for England and play 398 times for Leicester Tigers -- quite a feat in the modern era.\n\nYou'd think, then, that when it comes to rugby, few things would surprise Rowntree. But his latest career move to Georgia as a forwards coach has proved otherwise.\n\nGeorgia has a reputation for rearing some of the biggest, brawniest forwards the game has to offer, but even Rowntree was taken aback by what he observed in strength and conditioning sessions.\n\n\"I'll be sat on a bike in the corner and I can't believe how much weight they can lift. I've never seen anything like it,\" the Englishman tells CNN.\n\n\"Some of the weights! Their DNA must be incredible. I honestly can't believe how strong they are across the squad.\"\n\nGraham Rowntree is enjoying his time as a forwards coach with Georgia.\n\nAs a front row forward, Rowntree never scrummaged against a Georgian pack (\"thank God I didn't,\" he laughs), but he has long been aware of The Lelos' firepower upfront.\n\nIt was this reputation that first drew him to the job back in September last year, with an eye to bolstering Georgia ahead of the 2019 World Cup.\n\n\"I'll be honest with you, when I first met [prop] Davit Kubriashvili in October, it was a bit embarrassing really because I've always been an admirer of him playing in France,\" says Rowntree.\n\n\"I felt like a small child shaking his hand when I met him in October. To work with him was special. But the set piece, the scrum and the maul, I've been a fan of how Georgia operate.\"\n\n'Proud, hardworking people'\n\nIn his first few months, Rowntree has seen The Lelos -- the national team's nickname derived from lelo burti, a traditional Georgian game similar to rugby -- record wins over Samoa and Tonga, but lose to Italy in Florence.\n\nBased out of Tbilisi during international windows, he spends intervening periods in France traveling between the clubs where Georgian players are based.\n\nRowntree's taken to life in Georgia quickly, both as a rugby coach and a tourist.\n\n\"I love it. It suits me perfectly,\" he says. \"It's a cracking country. I've only been to Tbilisi, but as a city it's got a nice blend of new and old, modern and old architecture.\n\n\"The people are very warm, there are some unbelievable restaurants and wines -- believe me, I've tried to taste them all.\n\n\"It's not what you'd imagine as a former Russian country, it's beautiful. The people themselves are just so warm, but very proud, hardworking people.\"\n\nThe Georgian and English scrums pack down against each other during a training session in London last year.\n\nRugby is still something of a young sport in Georgia, but its recent growth has been impressive.\n\nThe Lelos have quickly outgrown some of their traditional competitors, winning eight of the last nine Rugby Europe Championship titles against the likes of Germany, Russia, Spain, and Belgium, with Romania providing the stiffest opposition.\n\nMilton Haig has been the country's head coach since 2012. He has long been vocal about welcoming Georgia into the Six Nations with Europe's so-called tier one sides, but while the door there remains firmly shut for now, the New Zealander is confident that the tournament might expand or incorporate promotion and relegation after 2021.\n\n\"It's nice to have one tier one per year,\" Haig tells CNN. \"But really does that help us progress?\n\n\"Because you play one game, then you don't really get an opportunity to review that and go back in and play the same type of team the following week to see if your performance has improved.\n\n\"There's no disrespect to the other tier twos that we play because they're obviously competitive matches, but we kind of think that for us to take the next step definitely we need more tier one games.\"\n\nMilton Haig oversees Georgia's scrum practice.\n\nWorld Cup 'chaos'\n\nGeorgia has businessman Bidzina Ivanishvilli to thank for its rugby boom -- a former Prime Minister and, according to Forbes , the country's richest man with an estimated value of $4.6 billion.\n\nHis passion for rugby has seen investment in the sport, allowing a country that reportedly used to conduct scrum practice by pushing Soviet-era tractors to develop its infrastructure at an elite and grassroots level.\n\nPhotos: The Rugby World Cup -- a history England, 2015 \u2013 New Zealand became the first side to retain the Rugby World Cup after defeating Australia 34-17 in the final at Twickenham Stadium.

What [Georgian fans] couldn't understand was that New Zealand was just a small country of the same population. So we should be able to beat them, without the real understanding that New Zealand were the current world champions and the number one team in the world.\n\n\"That's just part of our role to educate people and introduce the game properly.\"\n\n'I want to scare people'\n\nGeorgia will negotiate a pool with Australia, Wales, Fiji, and Uruguay at this year's World Cup in Japan, which is where Rowntree, part of the England set-up that crashed out of the competition on home soil at the group stages in 2015, can bring his wealth of experience.\n\n\"What I have learnt is that World Cups are about pressure,\" he says. \"I've been there with England myself. The tier one nations are under incredible pressure at World Cups when they play against the likes of Georgia. The pressure's on them, and that's a real strength that we have to play to.\n\nGeorgia's players celebrate defeating Tonga at the 2015 World Cup.\n\n\"I learnt a lot [in 2015]. You learn a lot about yourself and team dynamics under pressure like that ... I'm hardened from it. I'll be passing on every ounce of my knowledge, learnings and energy to the Georgians. I want us to be spoken about at this World Cup. I want to scare people.\"\n\nWhile The Lelos have always brought solid forward play to the World Cup, Haig is the first to admit that the team's style has at times become one dimensional and predictable. He's worked hard to change that by honing the team's catch-pass skills and developing a tactical kicking game.\n\n\"Really our game was based around the forwards,\" he says. \"I don't think that's going to be the same in Japan. One of the things now is we've developed a lot of young players. The team likes to play with a bit more width.\"\n\nPhotos: RWC 2019 venues New Zealand beat Australia 34-17 to win its second straight Rugby World Cup at Twickenham Stadium, London in October 2015.
