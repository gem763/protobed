The low prices have pushed down stock prices in the energy sector, which has paradoxically opened an opportunity for income investors.\n\nThe energy sector\u2019s production companies benefit from dealing in commodities \u2013 oil and gas \u2013 that are always in demand. They have high overhead, but they also have a ready market for the product and consequent strong cash positions. Low share prices are attractive to investors, and the companies have been following two strategies to boost their shares.\n\nFirst, they are simply buying back shares to support the price. And second, they are paying out high dividend yields, offering investors a steady income stream from the stocks. Average dividend yield in the energy sector is up to 3.9%, almost double the S&P 500\u2019s average yield of 2.1%. Income investing is a viable option for energy investors; since 1998, dividends in the energy sectors have brought triple the returns of simple price appreciation.\n\nWe\u2019ve taken a dive into TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener tool to find three energy stocks offering investors the best combination \u2013 \"strong buy\" consensus, and dividend yields above 9%.\n\nMPLX LP (MPLX)\n\nWhen you think of the energy industry, chances are you picture an oil well out West, or the gas station down the street. But between the actual extraction and the end user, there is a string of processes, refineries, pipelines, and transport systems that make up the midstream infrastructure of the industry. MPLX, a partnership formed by Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC), owns and operates an array of these midstream assets, including pipelines, inland shipping, product terminals, refinery storage, and the docks and loading systems associated with them. In effect, MPLX handles the product transport while Marathon handles extraction and production. Marathon owns a 20.4% interest in MPLX.\n\nIn addition to transport infrastructure, MPLX also operates a series of natural gas gathering systems, processing the untreated gas to extract various components. These include ethane, ethylene, propane, butane, gasoline, propylene. The company then sells these natural gas products. The most important feature of MPLX\u2019s business model, however, lies in the simple utility of energy transport niche. No matter what the price of crude oil or natural gas, the product still must reach the end user, and MPLX will get paid for that transportation.\n\nThe infrastructure and natural gas-product niche has been good for MPLX. Since 2018, the company has consistently posted earnings between 52 cents and 62 cents per share. The most recent report, for Q2 CY19, showed revenues of $1.63 billion, just below the estimate of $1.64 billion. The year-over-year gain was modest, at $60 million. Shares slipped $1 after the report, and have been volatile since.\n\nMPLX has used its steady earnings to support a reliable, paying out 66.75 cents per share quarterly, or $2.67 per year. The company has been raising the dividend payment steadily since 2014, and the yield has increased from 2.1% then to the current 9.96%.\n\nWall Street analysts have been pleased with MPLX and its performance. For example, Barclays\u2019 analyst Christine Cho reinstated her bullish stance on the stock and pointed out that the company has plenty of options to streamline operations without compromising profitability. Cho rates MPLX an Overweight (i.e. \"buy\") along with a $33 price target, indicating room for over 20% upside. (To watch Cho's track record, click here)\n\nThe analyst noted, \u201cWhile the company today has a far broader set of assets to rely upon during periods of change across the industry, management has also made it clear that perhaps their assets are spread across too many basins and they could be looking to sell interests down the road. We believe investors would support asset sales as the company focuses on competing in its core basins in the Permian and Northeast.\u201d\n\nWall Street backs Cho's bullish bite into the energy player as well as TipRanks analytics exhibit MPLX as a Strong Buy. Out of 7 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 6 are bullish on the stock, while only one remains sidelined. With a return potential of 25%, the stock's consensus target price stands at $33.57.
