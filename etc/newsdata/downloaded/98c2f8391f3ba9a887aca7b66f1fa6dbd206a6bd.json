But few things get us quite as excited as the Uniqlo U collection, designed by Christophe Lemaire. The pieces are always elevated, look way more expensive than they cost, and are a chance to get Lemaire\u2019s craftsmanship into our wardrobes. This collection, which dropped today, didn\u2019t disappoint. The trench coat is to die for and there\u2019s a gorgeous collection of button-downs. Yes, button-downs can be gorgeous. What makes the pieces brilliant is how they\u2019re so simple and very slightly elevated. It even makes us want to try out bow-legged jeans, a Lemaire staple that hasn\u2019t trickled down yet. They\u2019re called the \u201ccurved pants,\u201d and are a great chance to get ahead on a possible trend.
