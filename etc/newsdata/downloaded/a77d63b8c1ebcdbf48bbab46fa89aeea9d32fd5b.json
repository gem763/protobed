Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\n\n\"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare\" accomplishes its mission on multiple fronts with a compelling and dramatic single-player story campaign.\n\nFirstly, the video game (out Oct. 25 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PCs, rated Mature for ages 17-up) lives up to its namesake, \"Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare,\" the 2007 game that helped launch the video game franchise towards its stratospheric station as a perennial multibillion-dollar seller. The entertaining non-stop action spans the globe and keeps the player guessing where the story is headed.\n\nAnd, the story campaign alone suggests \"Call of Duty\" will continue the series' successful run \u2013 it's been the top-selling game each of the last ten years and topped $1 billion in sales annually for the last 15 years. (Remember every \"Call of Duty\" game has multiple ways to play including the ever-popular online multiplayer mode. This one has a special coop mode and a 2-vs.-2 online match mode, too.)\n\nStreaming team-up: Amazon Fire TV devices get Apple TV app in advance of Apple TV+ launch\n\n'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare': Latest shooter iteration ramps up realism, so it's not just all fun and video games\n\nThird, the strength of the characters in \"Modern Warfare\" resets the series, potentially, for a long run of adventures to come. This release is a \"reimagining\" of the 2007 game and brings back Capt. John Price, one of the characters introduced then in a pivotal role here. Players do not take on the role of Price, but he's a constant and crucial companion here.\n\nThe character of Capt. John Price, a British special forces officer, in 'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.'

Decades of Russian intervention in that country have lead to a coordinated resistance and a proxy war, thanks to support from the U.S. and its allies. Also wrecking havoc in the region, a terrorist group known as Al-Qatala. It's the mission of the team, led by Price, to find who has stolen a cache of poison gas before it's used on the innocent \u2013 in the Middle East or the West.\n\nLed by studio director Taylor Kurosaki, who spent a decade at Naughty Dog (\"Uncharted,\" \"The Last of Us\") before serving as narrative director on 2016's \"Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare,\" the creative team weaves an intriguing plot enhanced by stunning representation.\n\nTalk about eye candy. If you own a 4K TV, this is treat of color and contrast. The game showcases gaming's technological advances with realistic-looking, fluid-moving characters and lifelike-rendered environments. And it sounds great, too, and has a Dolby Atmos soundtrack.\n\nBack to the visuals. In one rooftop battle, you must fire flares to illuminate the battlefield. As the lighting fades, the encroaching darkness haunts your vision \u2013 and affects your strategy. You want to take a few seconds to soak in the rendering of the scene, but you have to focus making use of the light to take out targets. Later, your character in this scenario, British Special Air Service Sgt. Kyle Garrick, dons night vision goggles and the detail provided is impressive. You also play much of the game as Alex, a CIA covert operations officer.\n\nThe main characters in 'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare': (From left) Alex (Echo 3-1), Capt. John Price, Sgt. Kyle Garrick, and Farah Ahmed Karim. (Photo: Activision)\n\nCharacters faces are ultra-impressive; for instance, Capt. Price, has a beard and jowls that move naturally as he talks and makes expressions. His and other characters movements look fluid thanks to motion capture actors including former Navy SEALs.\n\nAs you progress, you aren't just running and gunning. There's plenty of crawling, climbing, and seeking cover. In one unique, but very stressful scene, you must use a cell phone and surveillance cameras to help an embassy staffer evade attackers who have broken into the building.\n\nMultitasking is a must. In a frenetic 360-degree firefight, you alternately move from using your sniper rifle to detonating bombs and shooting bad guys with rifles \u2013 at the same time tossing and dodging Molotov cocktails.\n\nBecause some of the action is brutal, the game begins with a \"Mature Content Notice,\" noting that some scenes include graphic and intense content. A scene in which British special forces track a terrorist cell to a townhouse was extremely stressful, despite having seen most of the sequence played months ago by the game's creators. Also intense was a scene in which a young Farah and her brother Hadir must fight off a Russian soldier armed only with household implements.\n\nLate in the game, Garrick is faced with a tough decision, one that is vital to the mission's success. Some players may flinch as this player did. As Price says in the game, \"We get dirty and the world stays clean. That's our mission.\"\n\nThis isn't child's play, but a game for those who watch combat thrillers such as \"American Sniper,\" \"Zero Dark Thirty,\" and \"Blackhawk Down,\" all visceral films that inspired the game.\n\n\"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare\" doesn't saddle you with an onerous story campaign \u2013 this reviewer finished in less than nine hours. But it's, as the music industry saying went, \"all killer no filler.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n\nVideo game review:: 'Ghost Recon Breakpoint' is a letdown -- with some bright spots\n\n'Call of Duty: Mobile': Video game offensive boasts new 'Fortnite'-style battle royale mode\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/gaming/2019/10/25/review-call-duty-modern-warfare-dramatic-fast-paced-action/4069801002/", "description": "New video game \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare\" delivers a dynamic adventure of family, loyalty and revenge amid a complex tale of geopolitical strife.", "authors": ["Mike Snider", "Published A.M.
