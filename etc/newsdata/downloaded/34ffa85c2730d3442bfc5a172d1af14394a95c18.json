football match freely for first time in decades", "language": "en", "text": "Thousands of Iranian women fans are to attend a football match freely Thursday for the first time in decades, after FIFA threatened to suspend the country over its controversial male-only policy.\n\nThe Islamic republic has barred female spectators from football and other stadiums for around 40 years, with clerics arguing they must be shielded from the masculine atmosphere and sight of semi-clad men.\n\nWorld football\u2019s governing body FIFA ordered Iran last month to allow women access to stadiums without restriction and in numbers determined by demand for tickets.\n\nThe directive came after a fan dubbed \u201cBlue Girl\u201d died after setting herself on fire in fear of being jailed for dressing up as a boy to attend a match.\n\nWomen were quick to get their hands on tickets to attend Iran\u2019s 2022 World Cup qualifier against Cambodia at Tehran\u2019s Azadi Stadium on Thursday.\n\nThe first batch sold out in less than an hour, and additional seats were also snapped up in short order, state media said.\n\nThe sports ministry said the 100,000-capacity stadium \u2014 whose name means \u201cFreedom\u201d in Farsi \u2014 was ready to host even more women.\n\nOne of the 3,500 women to have secured a ticket was Raha Poorbakhsh, a football journalist.\n\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe this is going to happen because after all these years of working in this field, watching everything on television, now I can experience everything in person,\u201d she told AFP.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Blue girl\u2019 \u2013\n\nBut Poorbakhsh said she was aware of many other women without tickets and some were expected to travel from as far away as Ahvaz in southern Iran in the hope of still getting one.\n\nThere have been rare occasions in recent years when Iranian women have been allowed to watch matches, but this time they were free to buy their own tickets, albeit a set number.\n\nThose lucky enough to attend will be segregated from men and watched over by 150 female police officers.\n\nPeople on the streets of Tehran said they supported the decision to allow women into stadiums.\n\n\u201cI would like there to be freedom for women, like men, to go freely and even sit side by side without any restrictions, like other countries,\u201d said a woman who gave her name only as Hasti.\n\nNader Fathi, who runs a clothing business, said the presence of women could improve the atmosphere in stadiums.\n\nBut he said \u201cthey will regret it\u201d if they are exposed to \u201creally bad swear words\u201d and \u201cbad behaviour\u201d.\n\nThe bumpy road Iranian women have travelled in order to gain free access to stadiums has not been without tragedy.\n\nSahar Khodayari died last month after setting herself ablaze outside a court in fear of being jailed for attending a match.\n\nDubbed \u201cblue girl\u201d because of the colours of the club she supported \u2014 Tehran giants Esteghlal FC \u2014 she had reportedly been detained last year when trying to enter a stadium dressed as a boy.\n\nHer death sparked an outcry, with many calling for Iran to be banned and matches boycotted.\n\nThe judiciary dismissed reports she had been told she would be jailed, and Khodayari\u2019s father said she did not \u201csacrifice\u201d herself for any cause.\n\n\u2013 Shadow of FIFA \u2013\n\nAhead of Qatar 2022, FIFA has pressed Iran to allow women to attend qualifiers.\n\nBut Iran denied its decision to allow women into Thursday\u2019s match was a result of \u201cforeign pressure\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe presence of #women in stadiums is due to the internal social demands and government\u2019s support of those demands,\u201d government spokesman Ali Rabiei tweeted.\n\nThe ban on women in stadiums is not written into law or regulations, but it has been strictly enforced.\n\nSince the 1979 Islamic revolution, women have only had rare access to stadiums in Iran.\n\nAbout 20 Irish women attended a World Cup qualifier in 2001, and four years later a few dozen Iranian women watched the national team take on Bahrain.\n\nIn October, as many as 100 \u201chandpicked\u201d Iranian women watched a friendly against Bolivia.\n\nThe day after, the prosecutor general warned there would be no repeat, saying it would \u201clead to sin\u201d.\n\nThen in November, a select group of about 850 women attended a match between Esteghlal\u2019s Tehran rivals, Persepolis FC, and Japan\u2019s Kashima Antlers.\n\nThe issue continues to be deeply divisive in Iran.\n\nReformists have welcomed the latest move, but conservatives have come out strongly against it.\n\nThe Donya-e-Eqtesad financial newspaper called it \u201ca step to weaken a taboo and also free Iran\u2019s football of the looming shadow of FIFA\u2019s punishment\u201d.\n\nBut the ultra-conservative Kayhan daily said women were more concerned about economic issues.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Thousands of Iranian women fans are to attend a football match freely Thursday for the first time in decades, after FIFA threatened to
