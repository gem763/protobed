These range from former schoolhouses in towns like Ain Eissa and Kobani to a former Syrian government prison at Hasaka. The prisons hold about 11,000 men, about 9,000 of them Syrian or Iraqi Arabs. About 2,000 come from some 50 other nations whose governments have refused to repatriate them.\n\nLater in the article, the Times acknowledged: \u201cThe Turkish government sees the Kurdish military presence so close to its border as a serious security threat, because the Kurdish forces have close ties with a guerrilla group that has waged a decades-long insurgency inside Turkey itself\u201d (emphasis added).\n\nLikewise, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who has been a harsh critic of Trump\u2019s withdrawal, admitted to a Russian prank caller (whom he mistook for the Turkish foreign minister) that some of the Kurds were a \u201cthreat\u201d to Turkey. Via Politico:\n\n\u201cYour YPG Kurdish problem is a big problem,\u201d Graham told the pranksters. He was referring to the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, a group that began fighting ISIS as part of the Syrian Democratic Forces in 2015\u2014with support from the U.S.\u2014but is considered a terrorist group by Turkey because of its push to establish an autonomous state for the Kurds on the Turkish-Syrian border. \u201cI told President Trump that Obama made a huge mistake in relying on the YPG Kurds,\u201d Graham continued. \u201cEverything I worried about has come true, and now we have to make sure Turkey is protected from this threat in Syria. I\u2019m sympathetic to the YPG problem, and so is the president, quite frankly.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Trump acknowledged as much in a press conference on Wednesday, appearing to echo Graham\u2019s private comments. \u201cIf you read today \u2014 a couple of reports saying that when President Obama started this whole thing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAs you know, it was started by President Obama; he created a natural war with Turkey and their longtime enemy, PKK. And they\u2019re still there.\u201d Turkey has been in conflict with the P.K.K., also known as the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, since the 1980s. Both Turkey and the U.S. consider it a terrorist organization.\n\nNone of that is to say that war was the only option for Turkey, or withdrawal for the United States. But the media are slowly acknowledging that the situation is far more complex than first suggested by knee-jerk criticism of Trump, which overlooked the conflicting interests of two American allies \u2014 one of whom is a member of NATO and hosts U.S. nuclear weapons on its territory, among other strategic assets.\n\nJoel B.
