It explains why they are propping up the division.\n\nThey had three such openings here, with Andre Gray somehow missing an empty goal from five yards and Sheffield United keeper Dean Henderson saving well from Danny Welbeck and Craig Dawson.\n\n\u2018With these attempts, if the players felt more security they would make good decisions with the last pass, and the last shot,\u2019 Sanchez Flores said.\n\nQuique Sanchez Flores shows his frustration as his side draw 0-0 against Sheffield United\n\nIt\u2019s a vicious circle, however, because the security of an improved league position won\u2019t come without forwards taking their chances.\n\nChris Wilder\u2019s Blades may be new to the Premier League but look streetwise enough to avoid a relegation battle. They controlled long spells of this match.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m delighted with the performance from box to box, but I feel we\u2019re a little light on points,\u2019 Wilder said. \u2018We have to marry that performance up with points.\u2019", "description": "No prizes for guessing what Watford will be working on in the international break.
