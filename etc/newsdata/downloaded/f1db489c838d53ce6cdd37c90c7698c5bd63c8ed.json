Well, as an example, former President Barack Obama likely would have been chased off the campaign trail had he made some recent comments of his as a 2020 Democratic primary candidate. On Tuesday, President Obama told an audience at the Obama Foundation Summit that they need to get over being \"woke\" and realize that simply judging people and \"casting stones\" does not equate to activism.\n\n\"This idea of purity and you\u2019re never compromised and you\u2019re always politically woke and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly,\" Obama told the group as seen in the clip below.\n\n\"The world is messy,\" he continued. \"There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws. People who you are fighting may love their kids. And you know, share certain things with you. And I think that one danger that I see amongst young people...and this is accelerated by social media, there is this sense sometimes of, 'the way of making change, is to be as judgmental as possible about other people.'\"\n\n\"Like if I tweet or hashtag about how you didn\u2019t do something right or used the wrong verb or then, I can sit back and feel good about myself, because, 'Man, You see how woke I was? I called you out.'I'm gonna get on TV. Watch my show, watch 'Grownish.' You know, that\u2019s not activism,\" the president continued. \"That\u2019s not bringing about change.\"\n\n\"If all you're doing is casting stones, you're probably not going to get very far. That's easy to do,\" he remarked.\n\nFormer President Obama to young people: \u201cThis idea of purity and you're never compromised and you're politically woke, and all that stuff \u2014 you should get over that quickly\u201d\n\n\n\nObama goes on to slam people who engage in cancel culture and who look to create constant online outrage pic.twitter.com/qQPdeJb7nV \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 30, 2019\n\nThese comments are well warranted. However, based on the fact that the progressive base has been blasting the Obama-era presidency as too moderate, I highly doubt they will heed his advice. As I've said before, if a person's idea of success does not fit within their 'wokeness,' then progressives see that person as a failure who deserves shaming. Will the left now shame Obama? We'll see.", "description": ".10/30/2019 10:16:11AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/269/05cff137-ee39-4e74-9eda-1ad4323197ac.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
