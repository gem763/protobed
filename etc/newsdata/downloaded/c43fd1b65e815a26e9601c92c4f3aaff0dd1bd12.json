The extremists wanted to kill Christians in nearby Iligan city on Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting, to mimic the violence seen by the world in Syria and Iraq, Ano said. Southeast Asian fighters fleeing the Middle East 'could look to Mindanao to provide temporary refuge as they work their way home,' said a report late last year by the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, predicting a high risk of regional violence. Marawi is regarded as the heartland of the Islamic faith on Mindanao island.\n\n'We call on the remaining terrorists to surrender while there is an opportunity,' military spokesman Brigadier-General Restituto Padilla said in a statement.\n\n'For the terrorists, not surrendering will mean their sure death.'\n\nPadilla also said the surrender call warning was aimed at limiting the loss of more lives and property.\n\nUp to 2,000 residents were trapped in areas held by the militants, according to the local government, and the International Committee of the Red Cross had voiced alarm they would be caught in the bombing raids or crossfire.\n\nThe militants also took a priest and up to 14 other people hostage at the start of the crisis, and their fate remains unknown.\n\nThe militants released a video in which they threatened to kill the hostages, according to a report by the SITE Intelligence Group on Monday that could not be verified.\n\nAnd clashes on Tuesday appeared to be as intense as previous days as military helicopters fired rockets repeatedly on that part of the city and black smoke rose from the buildings that were apparently hit.\n\nThe gunmen were being backed by foreign fighters, including those from Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, authorities said.\n\nGovernment troops head to the frontline as fighting with Muslim militants in Marawi city enters its

according to the military.\n\nThe death toll looked likely to climb, with soldiers reporting the smell of corpses in a public market still being held by the militants.\n\nMartin Thalmann, deputy head of the ICRC's Philippine delegation who is in Marawi, also said on Monday his staff had received reports from people trapped inside the militants' areas that residents had died from stray bullets and sickness.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte has declared martial law in the Philippines\n\nThe violence began when dozens of gunmen went on a rampage in response to an attempt by security forces to arrest Isnilon Hapilon, a veteran Filipino militant regarded as the local leader of ISIS.\n\nHapilon, a senior member of the Abu Sayyaf kidnap-for-ransom gang, is on the US government's list of most-wanted terrorists.\n\nHe was being protected in Marawi by the local Maute group, which has pledged allegiance to ISIS.\n\nHapilon, the Maute and other militants had been planning a major attack on Marawi, one of the few Islamic cities in the mainly Catholic Philippines with a population of 200,000 people, armed forces chief General Eduardo Ano said.\n\nHe said they were planning to launch the assault to coincide with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began on the weekend, but the raid on Hapilon triggered them to attack earlier, according to Ano.\n\nMuslim separatist rebellion in the southern Philippines has claimed more than 120,000 lives since the 1970s.\n\nThe main Muslim rebel groups have signed accords with the government aimed at forging a final peace, giving up their separatist ambitions in return for autonomy.\n\nThe Maute, the Abu Sayyaf and other hardline groups are not interested in negotiating and have in recent years looked to IS to help them.\n\nThe Marawi violence was intended to highlight their credentials to IS, security analysts have said.\n\nDuterte said Saturday he was prepared to enforce martial law for as long as was necessary to end the terrorist threat.\n\nFilipino troops inspect graffiti outside a parade of shops which reads, 'I love ISIS' with the date under it as well as 'ISIS fighters' written on the ground\n\nUp to 2,000

crossfire\n\nPhilippine Marines aim their weapons towards the stronghold of Maute group in Marawi\n\nThe Islamic fighters are said to be well-armed and resilient and experts have warned that with ISIS weakened in Syria and Iraq, battered by years of American-led attacks, Mindanao could become a focal point for regional fighters.\n\nThe fighters' support network in Marawi remains unclear, though the power of one militant group - the Mautes - has grown in recent years.\n\nLed by members of the city's Maute clan, the group has become increasingly active across Lanao del Sur province, where Marawi is located, and has been instrumental in the fighting this past week.", "description": "Terrified Filipino residents reported young jihadis  forcing people to recite verses of the Islamic scripture,
