REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\n\nOpposition deepened on Friday, when both France and Germany pledged to block Libra from operating in Europe and backed the development of a public cryptocurrency instead.\n\nFacebook\u2019s goal is for Libra to be run by an association of other corporate investors and non-profit members, with an expected launch in the first half of 2020.\n\nHere are some details about Facebook\u2019s plans: THE COIN\n\nLibra will be a digital currency backed by a reserve of real-world assets, including bank deposits and short-term government securities, and held by a network of custodians. The structure is intended to foster trust and stabilise the price.\n\nAlthough Libra prices may not always align with the underlying assets, holders should have a \u201chigh degree of assurance\u201d that they can convert coins into traditional currency based on an exchange rate, according to the project\u2019s information.\n\nLibra will trade on a network of exchanges, which Facebook did not identify.\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nLibra transactions will be powered and recorded by a blockchain, which is a shared ledger of transactions maintained by a network of computers.\n\nThe Libra blockchain will be permissioned, meaning that only entities authorized by the governing association will be able to run the computers. Its governance differs from bitcoin, which does not have an entity in charge.\n\nThe software will be \u201copen source,\u201d meaning companies outside the association can build applications on top of it.\n\nThe association plans to move towards a permissionless blockchain within five years of Libra\u2019s launch.\n\nTHE ASSOCIATION\n\nThe Libra Association is a 28-member independent non-profit based in Geneva, Switzerland. It will oversee major decisions about the digital coin.\n\nMembers include Mastercard Inc (MA.N), Visa Inc (V.N), Spotify Technology SA (SPOT.N), PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O), eBay Inc (EBAY.O), Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L), as well as venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Thrive Capital.\n\nThere is a minimum $10 million investment to join, except for non-profit members like financial inclusion group Kiva. The association aims to have 100 members by launch.\n\nEach will have one vote on important issues. Facebook will be a member via Calibra, a newly created subsidiary that will offer a digital wallet for Libra.\n\nTHE WALLET\n\nIndividuals and merchants will be able to use Calibra to store, send and receive Libras.\n\nIt will be available as a standalone app on smartphones, as well as a button within Facebook\u2019s Messenger and WhatsApp products.\n\nFacebook eventually wants to make Calibra available for transactions across its family of apps, such as digital checkouts for purchases on Instagram.\n\nThe company appears to be betting it can squeeze revenue out of its messaging services through transactions and payments, something that is already happening on Chinese social apps like WeChat.\n\nExecutives envision users purchasing Libra through the app either by linking a bank account or, for people without banks, at physical locations like cash transfer businesses and convenience stores.\n\nCalibra engineers are involved in building the blockchain, though Facebook says it intends to keep the currency and the wallet in separate entities.\n\nCalibra has about 100 employees, mostly based at Facebook\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, as well as in Tel Aviv. Calibra executive Kevin Weil told Reuters he did not foresee a dramatic expansion beyond that headcount.\n\nPRIVACY AND SECURITY\n\nEvery person who uses Calibra will have to go through a \u201cknow your customer\u201d process, which verifies user identities to prevent financial crimes.\n\nThat means anyone who signs up must share a government ID and other personal information.\n\nCalibra will provide support to customers who lose phones or their passwords and refund customers whose Libras are stolen by fraudsters, Facebook said.\n\nCalibra will only share user data with parent company Facebook and third parties when it has customer consent, or in other \u201climited cases,\u201d such as when law enforcement requests information, according to a statement.\n\nFacebook pledged not to use Calibra data to improve ad targeting.\n\nBusinesses will see the same information about customers who pay with Libra as they do about customers who pay with credit cards, Weil told Reuters.\n\nREGULATION\n\nRegulators have raised eyebrows about the Libra project since the week of its launch, citing concerns about its impact on the financial system, user privacy and its potential for use in money laundering.\n\nThe Group of Seven advanced economies warned in July that it would not let Libra proceed until all regulatory concerns had been addressed.\n\nU.S. authorities have also expressed caution, including a senior Treasury official who visited Switzerland earlier this week to discuss regulatory standards for cryptocurrencies.\n\nShortly afterward, Swiss authorities said Libra would be more than just a payments systems and would therefore be subject to extra requirements that typically apply to banks.\n\nThe project suffered another setback on Friday, when the French and German finance ministers said that virtual currencies pose risks to consumers, financial stability and even \u201cthe monetary sovereignty\u201d of European states.", "description": "Facebook Inc revealed lofty plans to establish a cryptocurrency called Libra in June, but the project quickly ran into trouble with sceptical regulators around the world.", "authors": ["Katie Paul", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429547170&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C23M", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
