USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 White House counselor Kellyanne Conway stood by her statements during a heated phone conversation with a Washington Examiner reporter that went viral on Thursday.\n\nDuring the confrontational conversation, Conway expressed frustration that Caitlin Yilek wrote about her husband George Conway\u2019s very public anti-Trump stance and bashful Twitter account in an article about Bloomberg reporting that said President Donald Trump may be considering Conway as his next chief of staff.\n\nYilek released audio and a transcript of the phone call.\n\n\u201cI just am wondering why in God\u2019s earth you would need to mention anything about George Conway\u2019s tweets in an article that talks about me as possibly being chief of staff,\u201d Conway said to Yilek.\n\nGeorge Conway says ...Trump's Syria decision is a 'colossal geopolitical blunder of historic significance'\n\n\u201cRespectfully, of course, it\u2019s just lazy to talk about somebody\u2019s Twitter feed. Do you talk about other people\u2019s spouses in your pieces, because I\u2019ve been looking around, I haven\u2019t learned a single thing from any of your pieces, and I\u2019m just wondering if you routinely talk about people\u2019s spouses?\u201d Conway continued. \u201cWhy is it relevant here? George\u2019s position is what?\u201d\n\nShe boasted, \"He gets his power through me, if you haven\u2019t noticed. Not the other way around.\u201d\n\nIn the phone call, Conway argued that Trump hadn't addressed her husband, who calls for the president's impeachment almost daily and constantly questions his mental health. Trump labeled George Conway, a conservative lawyer, the \"husband from Hell,\" earlier this year.\n\nAccording to the Examiner, Conway\u2019s assistant, Tom Joannou, contacted Yilek on Tuesday night for her phone number, and called her Wednesday morning, initiating an off-the-record call before Conway \"took over the call.\u201d\n\nThe false tweet below makes my point about how dangerous it is to characterize someone else\u2019s intentions, feelings, or state of mind, even if it\u2019s for clicks and kicks. https://t.co/v6df2aoU3Tpic.twitter.com/B3Qzzra0uW \u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) October 24, 2019\n\n\u201cListen, if you\u2019re going to cover my personal life, then we\u2019re welcome to do the same around here,\" Conway told the reporter in the phone call. \u201cIf it has nothing to do with my job, which it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s obvious, then we\u2019re either going to expect you to cover everybody\u2019s personal life or we\u2019re going to start covering them over here.\u201d\n\nA wall, where? Donald Trump: \u2018We\u2019re building a wall in Colorado\u2019\n\nConway continued to criticize Yilek, ingloriously telling her, \u201cOK, then let\u2019s talk about your job. What is your job exactly? Is your job to rely upon derivative reporting without picking up the phone and trying to ask questions or write things that are relevant?\"\n\nKellyanne Conway disparagingly told me it was improper to write about her husband and threatened to investigate my personal life in a conversation she thought was off the record. It wasn\u2019t. https://t.co/0FTz9jj5Cf \u2014 Caitlin Yilek (@hausofcait) October 24, 2019\n\nAfter an extensive back and forth about the article and the reasoning for mentioning Conway's husband, Yilek replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know that I have to explain that to you. I\u2019m just trying to do my job and what my editor tells me to do.\u201d\n\nConway shot back, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to rely upon the men in your life and pretend somehow by way of reporting that I rely on the men in my life, which clearly isn\u2019t the case.\"\n\nIn a statement, Conway acknowledged how it is unusual \"in Washington and especially in Republican politics \u2014 for a man to gain newfound fame and power through his wife ... Like every couple I know, George and I disagree on many big things and agree on many big things.\"\n\n\"Exactly none of it affects my position as Counselor to the President. Exactly none of it is anyone's business,\" she concluded.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/24/kellyanne-conway-washington-examiner-reporter-clash-phone-call/4091992002/", "description": "White House counselor Kellyanne Conway\u00a0stood by her statements during a phone conversation with a Washington Examiner reporter\u00a0that went viral.", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
