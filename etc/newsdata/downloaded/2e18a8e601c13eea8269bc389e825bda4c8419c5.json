National Weather Service Meteorologist Curt Kaplan warns that the area hasn\u2019t seen such extreme conditions since 2007. That year, California faced 9,093 wildfires, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.\n\nKaplan explains what makes the situation so dangerous is that the region is facing four dangerous factors at once \u2014 powerful Santa Ana winds with gusts over 60 mph, very dry vegetation, very low humidity, and a long duration of favorable conditions for a fire.\n\nKaplan warned that that the combination means that the conditions are different than a \u201crun-of-the-mill\u201d red flag warning.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The landscape is unusually dry, because the region recently underwent a long drought and has gotten little rain since the winter. On top of that, the humidity is at \u201czero\u201d in some locations, Phillips.\n\n\u201cThese are dangerous conditions. Be prepared to evacuate if you need to,\u201d says Phillips.\n\nExperts say that California\u2019s wildfires have become larger and more damaging in recent years. Although the causes are complex, experts say that climate change has increased the frequency of the hot and dry conditions that fuel fires, and that rising costs have compelled construction in areas at high risk for fires.\n\nWrite to Tara Law at tara.law@time.com.", "description": "An \u201cextreme\u201d red flag warning has been declared in the Los Angeles area ahead of some of the worst conditions for a fire in the last 12 years.", "authors": ["Tara Law"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/getty-fire.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
