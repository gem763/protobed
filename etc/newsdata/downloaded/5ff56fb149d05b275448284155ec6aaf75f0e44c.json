But you are asking people to go along with surrendering their country -- it is not going to happen. It\u2019s a very fluid situation and it wouldn\u2019t take much to spark it off.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party is opposed to the deal, suggesting it weakens Northern Ireland\u2019s place in the union. The U.K. effectively split Ireland in 1921 to placate a largely Protestant, unionist majority in the north in the face of increasingly demands from the Catholic-dominated south for independence from Britain.\n\n\u201cIf this goes ahead we are into an economic United Ireland, the whole basis of the Union is gone, it\u2019s weakened,\u201d Bryson said. \u201cIt is going to have to be resisted.\u201d\n\nStill, other forces in unionism cautioned against inflaming the situation. The Orange Order, which celebrates Northern Ireland\u2019s place in the U.K., said it\u2019s not the time for widespread protest which could paralyze the region, Reuters reported.\n\n\u201cThere is a feeling people need to do something but I would be encouraging people that it isn\u2019t a case for street protest at this time,\u201d Orange Order Grand Secretary Mervyn Gibson told Reuters.\n\nBryson said all sides want to avoid a return to violence.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a danger if you get a massive amount of people on the streets,\u201d he said. \u201cViolence would be foolish but I can\u2019t predict the future.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Rodney Edwards in London at redwards102@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Chad Thomas at cthomas16@bloomberg.net, Dara Doyle\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Northern Irish loyalists vowed to resist what they see as the economic reunification of Ireland implicit in Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, warning of civil disobedience on the streets of Belfast that risks tipping over into violence.In London on Tuesday, Parliament will vote on the general", "authors": ["Rodney Edwards"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
