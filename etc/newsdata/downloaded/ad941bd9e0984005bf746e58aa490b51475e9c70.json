First, he\u2019s on the receiving end of a call from Donald Trump about maybe trading a foreign investigation into presidential candidate Joe Biden for American military support, and now he\u2019s meeting with one of our biggest stars. Tom Cruise is reportedly looking to make a movie in Ukraine, and the country\u2019s head of state, Volodymyr Zelensky, sent him an official invitation to visit his office in Kiev. Cruise accepted, and so the former actor and comedian (yes, we\u2019re talking about Zelensky) met with the current global-screen superstar and told him he\u2019s very handsome. \u201cThe president of Ukraine told the guest about his own experience in cinema,\u201d Zelensky\u2019s office said. The country has started courting business from foreign filmmakers by offering production subsidies, and a Cruise-size production seems like it would be a welcome presence in that regard.\n\nZelensky also recently met with Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis (who was born in the USSR-incorporated Ukraine), but that was more about politics and the new president rooting out government corruption. We don\u2019t know Cruise\u2019s thoughts on the current impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives, but Kutcher, for one, seems quite unhappy with American politics.
