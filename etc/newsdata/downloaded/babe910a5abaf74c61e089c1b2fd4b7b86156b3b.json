A cameraman for a Turkish media outlet suffered a fatal heart attack while running to the scene.\n\nThe star-studded cast features Paul Walter Hauser (\"I, Tonya\"; \"BlacKkKlansman\") as Jewell, whose life was turned upside down when law enforcement identified him as a person of interest in the bombing.
