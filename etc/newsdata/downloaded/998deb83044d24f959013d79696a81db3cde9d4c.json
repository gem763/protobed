The United States has been trying to create an international maritime security alliance since attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf.\n\nThe Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which is battling a Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen, claimed responsibility for the assault on two Saudi oil plants on Sept. 14, including the world\u2019s largest processing facility.\n\nU.S. and Saudi officials reject the claim and say Iran was behind them, a charge Tehran denies.\n\n\u201cIf the Americans think of any plots, the Iranian nation will respond from the Mediterranean, to the Red Sea and to the Indian Ocean,\u201d General Yahya Rahim-Safavi, a senior adviser to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. president (Donald Trump) will face the same fate as the six presidents before him who failed to impose their political will on the Iranian nation, and Trump will join history with the same yearning,\u201d said Rahim-Safavi, a former chief commander of the Revolutionary Guards.\n\nTrump last year withdrew from Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world power\u2019s and reimposed sanctions on Tehran, which has faced U.S. pressures and sanctions since its 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\nTrump has pursued a policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Iran to try to force it into broader talks to restrict its ballistic missile programme and end its support for proxy forces ranging from Syria to the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nIran\u2019s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has warned Trump against being dragged into a war in the Middle East and said Tehran would meet any offensive action with a crushing response.\n\nThe United States said on Thursday it was building a coalition to deter Iranian threats. But, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, Trump wants a peaceful solution to the crisis.\n\nIran\u2019s U.N. mission has confirmed that the United States has issued visas allowing Rouhani and Zarif to attend the United Nations General Assembly. Rouhani is to leave on Monday for New York, state television said.", "description": "Iran maintained its defiant stance against the United States in the wake of attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure claimed by a Tehran ally, saying on Friday it would resist any U.S. plots against it \"from the Mediterranean, to the Red Sea and to the Indian Ocean\".", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
