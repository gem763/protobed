police arrived.\n\nDavid Pomphret can be seen holding his head in his hands while sitting in the back of an ambulance as his wife lay dead near her horses stables.\n\nThe 51-year-old had smashed wife Ann Marie 30 times over the head with a metal crowbar shortly after a shopping trip to Asda.\n\nHe was convicted today at Liverpool Crown Court of deliberately killing his 49-year-old victim.\n\nIn the bodycam footage recorded by a policeman at the scene, Pomphret starts to explain what he claims happened, saying he was concerned when his wife phoned to say she was at the stables a few hours ago, but wasn't picking up her phone.\n\nHe said: \"She's lying there, oh God, she's just lying there.\"\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\nAsked if he'd touched her, he added: \"Yeah, they tried to get me to do mouth-to-mouth, oh jeez I almost threw up.\"\n\nThe IT expert had claimed in court, he had suffered a loss of control, and only should be found guilty of manslaughter.\n\nDad-of-one Pomphret flew into a rage in the face of constant criticism and accusations from his wife Ann Marie, who he attacked at remote horse stables the couple owned in Burtonwood, Warrington.\n\nThe 51-year-old had lost his cool after his wife had fired taunts at him, including calling him \"limp\", which referred, he reckoned, to his problems with erectile dysfunction.\n\nAnn Marie suffered terrible injuries, mainly with a gaping hole on the right side of her head.\n\nThis afternoon, the seven women and five men of the jury unanimously found him guilty of murder after a two week trial.\n\n(Image: CPS)\n\nThey had deliberated for ten hours and 42 minutes.\n\nPomphret showed no emotion in the dock when the verdict was returned.\n\nJudge David Aubrey, QC, said: \"You have been convicted by the jury of the crime of the murder of your wife.\n\n\"There can only be one sentence, a sentence of life imprisonment.\n\n\"I will determine the minimum term that you must serve before being considered eligible by the parole board on Tuesday morning.\"\n\nPomphret was remanded in custody.\n\nAs part of a conniving act, Pomphret refused to give his wife CPR and told the 999 car handler \u201cshe is white as a sheet, [her] chest isn\u2019t moving\u201d and declined to give chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth, adding: \"No no, she is stone cold.\"\n\nWhen encouraged further, he replied: \"Are you joking?\"\n\n(Image: CPS)\n\nThe victim, who had been diagnosed with a number of mental health issues for many years,along with her autism, had been receiving treatment for cancer.\n\nFor months, Pomphret told detectives he had no clue about his wife's death, and it was many weeks later, after 15 separate interviews with cops, that he suddenly changed tack and admitted her manslaughter.\n\nBefore the trial, the Barclays employee was described by his barrister as a \"man of impeccable character,\" who for many years, had \"been a model of self-control, patience and restraint.\"\n\nDetective Inspector Adam Waller, who was in charge of the investigation for Cheshire Police, said: \u201cThis case was truly shocking and one of the biggest investigations the Constabulary has seen in recent years.\n\n\"The injuries sustained by Ann Marie were horrific and all those involved in this investigation were determined to find her killer and ensure they were brought to justice for their actions.\n\n\u201cThe diligence and determination of every single officer and member of staff who worked on this case paid off and the evidence they tirelessly gathered was so overwhelming that when Pomphret was presented with this after he was charged he couldn\u2019t maintain the lie any longer and he was left with no choice but to plead guilty to killing his wife.\n\n\"However, this was after 15 police interviews had taken place and having spent five months on bail maintaining his innocence.\n\n\u201cWhat Pomphret did that day ripped a family apart and he will now have to face the consequences of that behind bars.\n\n\"My thoughts go out to Ann Marie\u2019s family who have had to wait until this trial took place and then have the upsetting details laid bare in the media coverage.", "description": "David Pomphret, 51, can be seen holding his head in his hands while sitting in the back of an ambulance", "authors": ["Luke Traynor", "Kelly-Ann Mills",
