It\u2019s a terrible situation for a campaign to be in. But that\u2019s life when you\u2019re dealing with Donald Trump.\u201d\u2026\n\nZac Petkanas, the director of rapid response for Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, said Democrats may have miscalculated four years ago in ignoring conspiracy theories that sprouted on the fringes of the Internet.
