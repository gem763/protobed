Upon arriving, one of the responding officers shouted commands before opening fire through a window after \u201cperceiving a threat.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, police said the officer had seen a person standing inside the residence and fired one shot at the \u2018suspect\u2019 before going inside to give the woman emergency medical care. Jefferson died in her bedroom with her eight-year-old nephew in the house.\n\nThis incident is all the more reason to know and exchange phone numbers with your neighbors. A sad outcome to a well meaning gesture by a neighbor. #AtatianaJeffersonpic.twitter.com/o5kGz3OGlN \u2014 Ricardo Lewis (@ParkerRocks425) October 14, 2019\n\nAt a press conference on Monday, Police Chief Ed Kraus identified the shooter as 35-year-old officer Aaron Dean, who had joined the department in April 2018. Kraus claimed he planned to fire Dean if he had not resigned by Monday morning.\n\n\u201cHad the officer not resigned I would have fired him for violations of several policies, including our use of force policy, our de-escalation policy, and unprofessional conduct,\u201d Kraus said, adding that Dean has not cooperated with the investigation.\n\nFormer FW police officer Aaron Dean resigned this morning before he could be fired, according to FWPD Interim Chief Ed Kraus. He fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson early Sat morning in her home during a welfare check. #FWPD#AaronDean#FOX4pic.twitter.com/QX2XQQ6t7R \u2014 Macy Jenkins (@MacyJJenkins) October 14, 2019\n\nBody camera footage released by the police department shows the officer approaching the home. He shines a flashlight into what looks like a dark room and shouts \u201cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\u201d \u2013 but he does not identify himself as a police officer. Police said they released the footage to provide \u201ctransparent and relevant information to the public.\u201d\n\nFort Worth Mayor Betsy Price called the shooting unjustifiable and unacceptable. \u201cThere is nothing that can justify what happened on Saturday morning \u2013 nothing,\u201d she told journalists.\n\nThe neighbor who called the police, James Smith, told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that he was worried when he saw Jefferson\u2019s door open because he knew she was there with her nephew. Smith told the newspaper that he felt partly responsible for her death. \u201cIf I had never dialed the police department, she\u2019d still be alive,\u201d he said.\n\nKraus told reporters an investigation into the shooting is ongoing and an update will be released on Tuesday. He added that the FBI had also been briefed and will investigate possible civil rights violations.\n\nI seriously can\u2019t believe this. We just finished the #BothamJean trial in DFW. #AtatianaJefferson was in her home playing games with her 8 year old nephew, and a cop shot her dead through her window in 3 seconds. These cannot be dismissed as tragic mistakes. These lives matter. pic.twitter.com/89HmVrIxQL \u2014 Omar Suleiman (@omarsuleiman504) October 13, 2019\n\nJefferson\u2019s death comes just two weeks after former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was sentenced to 10 years in prison for fatally shooting her neighbor Botham Jean in his own apartment \u2013which she had mistaken for her own\u2013 while arriving home off-duty.\n\nLee Merritt, an attorney for the families of both Jefferson and Jean, told CNN that she had been playing video games with her young nephew before she died. \u201cThere was no reason for her to be murdered,\u201d he said.\n\nI wanted to paint the last thing pre-Med graduate Atatiana Jefferson was doing before she was killed by the cops...\n\nHer Life Mattered.#AtatianaJefferson#TayJefferson#DallasFortWorth#FWPDpic.twitter.com/xiavrFO0pX \u2014 NIKKOLAS (@4NIKKOLAS) October 13, 2019\n\nLike this story?
