He polled at 0 percent in New York City, 0 percent in the suburbs and 0 percent upstate in the presidential primary and had only a 33 percent favorability rating in New York City.\n\nAnd his fundraising style was a risky one, garnering at least two complaints to the Federal Election Commission because he had quietly turned a political action committee purportedly intended to help other Democrats into an exploratory committee for himself.\n\nHe blamed his challenges on getting into the campaign late \u2014 May 16, after most candidates had already begun stumping \u2014 saying it is difficult to run for office while overseeing the city. But he found the time and funding for months before he announced to travel to Iowa and other early-voting states to meet people, deliver remarks and do other campaign-style events.\n\nDe Blasio continued to question the electability of former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the leading candidates, on Friday, warning that Democrats might not vote if they are not inspired by their nominee.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to worry about a lack of unity; we do need to worry about a lack of passion,\u201d he said, declining to say who would get his support. \u201cIf Democrats don\u2019t stand for something, do not assume people will come out and vote if they\u2019re not inspired.\u201d\n\n", "description": "\"I feel like I've contributed all I can to this primary election and it's clearly not my time,\u201d he told MSNBC.", "authors": ["Sally Goldenberg", "Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1a/25/ed3cfa584ad3846bdedf6c2d287d/190920-bill-de-blasio-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
