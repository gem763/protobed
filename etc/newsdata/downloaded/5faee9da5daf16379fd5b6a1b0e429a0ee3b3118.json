But King County refused to notify ICE that Mr. Iraheta-Vega was being released from jail, and instead freed him into the community. He would have more run-ins with the law, each time escaping ICE\u2019s clutches, until his arrest last week on suspicion of murder.\u201d\n\nJust days earlier, an illegal immigrant Carlos Daniel Carillo-Lopez, was arrested for allegedly killing a teenager whose girlfriend had posted photos of herself flashing rival gang signs (via The Washington Times):\n\nIn the case of Mr. Carillo-Lopez, police say he was part of a group of Surenos gang members who went looking to fight a boy who had been a friend. They feuded after the boy\u2019s girlfriend posted photos online suggesting fealty to the rival 18th Street gang. ICE said Mr. Carillo-Lopez had multiple run-ins with police, both before and after the April murder he now stands accused of, yet each time local authorities refused requests to notify deportation agents of his release. In Mr. Iraheta-Lopez\u2019s case, he was arrested by the Kent Police Department on Nov. 8 for stealing a car and ICE placed a detainer request on him. It was ignored.\u201d\n\nAfter his release, Carillo-Lopez was arrested two more times for driving under the influence.\n\nAs the Washington Times notes, \u201cBoth Mr. Iraheta-Vega and Mr. Carillo-Lopez snuck into the U.S. as juveniles and were deemed Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC), which qualified them for lenient treatment under American law, earning quick release to sponsors in the community. Both made their way to the Seattle area where, police say, they hooked up with transnational criminal gangs that increasingly rely on illegal immigrant teens to boost their ranks. They built their own criminal records, all while being shielded from deportation by liberal local governments\u2019 non-cooperation policies.\u201d\n\nRecommended Different Sexes John Stossel\n\n\u201cKing County\u2019s willful refusal of ICE warrants only protects those who harm the community,\u201d Nathalie Asher, director of removal operations at ICE\u2019s Seattle field office, told the Times. The Seattle area should serve as a warning for other cities, but the D.C. City Council recently voted unanimously to adopt a sanctuary-city policy for itself.\n\nSince cities cannot be counted on to properly deal with violent, illegal aliens and safeguard their residents, all the more reason the Trump administration has to stop them at the border.", "description": "Seattle-area authorities refuse to work with ICE, and their residents keep getting murdered..10/16/2019 9:30:45AM EST.", "authors": ["Bronson Stocking", "Leah Barkoukis", "Julio Rosas", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/335/f744bc4f-3e55-4ce1-95fb-779962da5b22.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
