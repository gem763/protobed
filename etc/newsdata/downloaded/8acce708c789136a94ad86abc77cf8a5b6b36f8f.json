The signal-caller sustained the head injury after a hit by Baltimore Ravens safety Earl Thomas during last Sunday\u2019s game. Thomas was fined $21,000 for the hit but plans to appeal the fine.\n\nDespite the concussion, Rudolph practiced in a limited capacity throughout the week. Devlin Hodges, who is expected to make his first career start Sunday, took the majority of the first-team reps in practice.\n\n\u201cMan, it\u2019s just a part of life. It\u2019s just stuff that we get,\u201d Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster told reporters Friday. \u201cWith No. 7 [Ben Roethlisberger] going down and now Mason\u2019s down, we got Hodges and he\u2019s going to go in there and do his job.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a part of life. \u2018Next man up,\u2019 we say. We just keep working and build that chemistry.\u201d\n\nHodges, an undrafted rookie, took over in the third quarter of the Steelers\u2019 loss to the Ravens in Week 5. He completed 7-of-9 passes for 68 yards in the team\u2019s overtime loss after filling in for Rudolph.\n\nThe Steelers also promoted practice squad quarterback Paxton Lynch and running back Trey Edmunds to the 53-man roster. The team released offensive lineman Fred Johnson and linebacker Jayrone Elliott in corresponding roster moves.", "description": "Oct. 11 (UPI) \u2014 Pittsburgh Steelers backup quarterback Mason Rudolph was ruled out for the team\u2019s Week 6 matchup against the Los Angeles", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
