The parliament has a veto on any deal agreed.\n\nThe resolution, drafted by the main political parties in the parliament, reiterates the EU\u2019s complaint that the UK government \u201cinsists that the backstop must be removed from the withdrawal agreement but has not until now put forward legally operable proposals that could replace it\u201d.\n\nIt expresses the EU\u2019s \u201creadiness to revert to a Northern Ireland-only backstop\u201d, the original proposal from the bloc rejected by Theresa May as being a threat to the UK\u2019s constitutional integrity. But the resolution stresses it \u201cwill not give consent to a withdrawal agreement without a backstop\u201d.\n\nBrexit: Ministers have taken 'considerable steps' to avert no-deal dangers in report, says Gove - live news Read more\n\nThe EU insists any deal must include a last-resort arrangement to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and protect the all-Ireland economy under any circumstances.\n\nIn light of the UK government\u2019s stated policy of seeking regulatory divergence from the EU in order to gain a competitive advantage, the parliament further \u201ccalls into question how close the future EU/UK economic relationship can be\u201d.\n\nDemanding provisions in any future deal that ensure the UK signs up to \u201chigh levels of environmental, employment and consumer protections\u201d, the resolution warns \u201cany free-trade agreement that fails to respect such levels of protection would not be ratified by the European parliament\u201d. Johnson\u2019s EU envoy, David Frost, has in recent days spoken with European commission officials about the UK\u2019s intention to diverge from EU standards.\n\nBut the strongest criticism of Johnson\u2019s approach is reserved for the prime minister\u2019s treatment of EU citizens living in the UK which the parliament accuses of worsening an already \u201chostile environment\u201d.\n\nA sharp rise in the proportion of EU citizens not considered eligible for so-called settled status has caused alarm among campaign groups and MEPs in recent weeks.\n\nThe proportion of people instead being granted \u201cpre-settled\u201d status \u2013 and therefore finding themselves without a guaranteed permanent right to remain \u2013 has risen from 32% during the testing phase to 34% in the month after the national launch in March, and on to 42% in July.\n\nThe parliament\u2019s resolution \u201cexpresses its concern at the implementation of the UK\u2019s settlement scheme and the high levels of applications \u2026 who are only accorded pre-settled status\u201d.\n\nThe parliament calls on the UK to adopt a \u201cdeclaratory\u201d scheme in which the burden of proving an EU citizen does not have the right to permanently stay is placed on the Home Office.\n\nPriti Patel, the home secretary, also comes under fire for her initial announcement of the end of free movement from 31 October, followed by a swift U-turn when the UK parliament was prorogued and the required legislation could not be passed.\n\nThe European parliament\u2019s resolution expresses \u201cgrave concern that recent and conflicting announcements by the Home Office in relation to free movement after 31 October 2019 have generated very unhelpful uncertainty for EU citizens resident in the UK, with the risk that those announcements may exacerbate the hostile environment towards them as well as impact negatively on their ability to enforce their rights\u201d.\n\nThe parliament also notes the \u201cstrong reaction\u201d, including by the courts, to the \u201cdecision to prorogue the UK parliament until 14 October, which makes the possibility of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU without an agreement more likely\u201d.\n\nGiven the House of Commons vote in support of the Benn bill ensuring Johnson will have to request an extension of the UK\u2019s membership of the EU beyond 31 October if a deal is not agreed, the parliament says it is open for such a Brexit delay if there is to be a general election or second referendum, or even to prevent a no deal exit.\n\nLuisa Porritt MEP, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats in the European parliament, said: \u201cThe European parliament is right to be deeply concerned about the settled status scheme and its botched implementation.\n\n\u201cEU27 citizens continue to be subject to intolerable uncertainty and face a dismissive attitude from the Home Office. Our European neighbours are rightly outraged at the way the government has disregarded their rights, as well as the application of the rule of law.\u201d", "description": "Leaked resolution says MEPs will use veto against any Brexit deal without a backstop", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4986ae26f5036a53b0405bc8b8c8a4d147288345/0_201_5090_3055/master/5090.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2fd6fbbcdcfa80aed8343e527cd0168d", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
