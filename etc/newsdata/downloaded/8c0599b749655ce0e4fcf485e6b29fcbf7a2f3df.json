Derby\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York injected $58.15 billion in overnight liquidity into financial markets.\n\nThe Fed accepted $50.95 billion in Treasurys, $500 million in agencies and $6.7 billion in mortgage-backed securities.\n\nMonday's operation by the Fed is part of an effort to help tame volatility in short-term rate markets with temporary and permanent injections of liquidity. Fed repo interventions take in Treasury and mortgage securities from eligible banks in what is effectively a loan of central bank cash, collateralized by dealer-owned bonds.\n\nOn Friday, the Fed permanently added to its holdings with $7.501 billion in Treasury bill purchases, which are aimed at growing the Fed's nearly $4 trillion in holdings. Also Friday, the Fed added $56.65 billion in short-term liquidity, which expired Monday.\n\nShort-term rate levels weren't elevated Friday, suggesting markets weren't under any particular stress. The effective fed-funds rate stood at 1.85%, in the middle of the 1.75% to 2% range targeted by the central bank. The broad general collateral rate, which governs banks' lending of securities and cash to one another, stood at 1.85% as well, while the Secured Overnight Financing Rate was 1.88%.\n\nWrite to Michael S.
