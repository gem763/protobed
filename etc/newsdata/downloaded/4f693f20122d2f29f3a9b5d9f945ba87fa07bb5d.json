I've loved the feeling of constant excitement at what could be - and pride at our achievements so far.\"\n\nThe Welsh have won four of their last five games against South Africa; all four wins have come in Cardiff at the close of South Africa's season, however, and the Springboks will feel they won the one of the five that mattered most - the 2015 World Cup quarter-final.\n\nThere is an intense and respectful rivalry Anita Aggarwal, Wales fan\n\nThe clashes have mostly been won by one or two scores and the expectation is that it will again be a tight affair with South Africa flyhalf Handre Pollard believing a single kick will probably settle it.\n\n\"It's going to be an incredibly tense and physical game, which will be so exciting when so much is at stake,\" said our superfan Anita, who has made the 6,000 miles journey to Tokyo from Cardiff, the Welsh capital. \"There is an intense and respectful rivalry.\"\n\nMotivation\n\nBoth teams have had a sense of mission driving them at this tournament. The 2011 semi-final loss to France after Sam Warburton was sent off has haunted Wales ever since and there will be a determination from a battle-hardened squad to send Gatland off at the end of his 12 years of service with some sort of prize.\n\n\"You get these opportunities once in a lifetime potentially and you've got to grab them with both hands and make the most of it,\" the Wales coach said this week.\n\n\"It's about having no regrets and that's the message of this week.\"\n\nSouth Africa have won the World Cup twice - firstly as hosts of the 1995 tournament in a newly democratic country, when captain Francois Pienaar received the trophy from a jubilant Nelson Mandela in one of the sport's greatest ever moments - but they feel honour-bound to make up for a couple of years in which their performance has not matched their historic successes.\n\n\"I think we have been under pressure for the past couple of years to redeem ourselves,\" said coach Rassie Erasmus.\n\n\"We've been number five, six, seven in the world over the last three years since 2015, and we've got some proper hidings against almost all the teams. Now we are at that stage where we want to become number one in the world again.\"\n\nCan Wales spoil that dream?\n\n\"Absolutely,\" says fan Anita Aggarwal. \"But there can be no mistakes from here.
