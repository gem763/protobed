REUTERS/Christian Hartmann/File Photo\n\nLosses were limited by optimism about a potential Brexit deal and signals from OPEC that further supply curbs are possible.\n\nGlobal benchmark Brent LCOc1 futures lost 61 cents, or 1.0%, to settle at $58.74 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 fell 78 cents, or 1.5%, to settle at $52.81.\n\nEarlier in the session, both Brent and WTI fell by more than $1 a barrel following a report overnight that China\u2019s factory gate prices in September declined at the fastest pace in more than three years. Also, customs data on Monday showed Chinese imports contracted for a fifth straight month.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade war will cut 2019 global growth to its slowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the International Monetary Fund warned, but it said output would rebound if duelling tariffs were removed.\n\n\u201cThe market continues to focus on a weakening global economic growth path that appeared little disturbed by last week\u2019s apparent lack of significant progress at the US-China trade talks,\u201d Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Illinois, said in a report.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said China had agreed to purchase $40 to $50 billion worth of American agricultural goods in a first phase of an agreement to end the trade war.\n\nChinese firms have purchased 700,000 tonnes of pork and 700,000 tonnes of sorghum from the United States this year to meet market demand, a foreign ministry spokesman said on Tuesday. U.S. government data pointed to smaller pork sales.\n\nThe oil market retraced early losses after reports Britain and the EU made headway in eleventh-hour talks to reach a Brexit deal.\n\n\u201cBritain seems they are getting closer to a Brexit deal with the EU, but it will probably be highly unlikely for enough progress to be made before the EU summit on Thursday,\u201d Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York, said in a report.\n\nAnalysts said any deal that avoids a \u201chard\u201d or no deal Brexit should boost economic growth.\n\nProviding more support, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers \u201cwill do whatever (is) in its power\u201d to sustain oil market stability beyond 2020.\n\nOPEC, Russia and other producers have cut oil output by 1.2 million barrels per day to support the market. Yet an expected rise in U.S. crude inventories this week kept prices under pressure. [EIA/S]\n\nU.S. crude stocks probably grew for the fifth straight week, a preliminary Reuters poll showed.\n\nU.S. oil inventory reports are due out from industry group the American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday and the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Thursday. The reports are delayed one day due to a U.S. government holiday.", "description": "Oil prices fell on Tuesday, as investors worried that the unrelenting U.S.-China trade war would keep squeezing the global economy, and that swelling U.S. crude inventories would further pressure prices.", "authors": ["Scott Disavino", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1440978085&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E06V", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
