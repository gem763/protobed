Wong, who slogged it out on the open-mic circuit, presents a grim account of life on the road: dying onstage, bad food, bad men. She did it for more than a decade before becoming a star seemingly overnight with her first Netflix special, performed while seven-and-a-half months pregnant. Did she ever consider giving up? \u201cThere were times when I thought to myself: \u2018I really don\u2019t know if I can do this for the rest of my life,\u2019\u201d she says on the phone from her home in LA. \u201cYou know, staying at those motels, getting paid that little amount of money. I\u2019m certain I would not have endured. I couldn\u2019t. Especially after having kids.\u201d\n\nLuckily for Wong, she didn\u2019t have to; instead, her career blew up. In 2016, Netflix launched her special, Baby Cobra, and she has since had a second, Hard Knock Wife. She has also co-written and starred in a romantic comedy film, Always Be My Maybe; had her two children; and published Dear Girls, the memoir written for them. Her tours sell out and her peers rave about her (Amy Schumer calls her \u201crevolutionary\u201d, Chris Rock championed her). \u201cIt\u2019s been an unbelievable three years,\u201d she says with some understatement.\n\nOffstage, she seems softer and more laid-back than her fierce and foul-mouthed standup persona. In the book, she recalls starting out: \u201cI was very dirty back then. Even now, I\u2019ll look back on those days and think: \u2018God, you were disgusting.\u2019\u201d Which is very funny if you have seen any of Wong\u2019s comedy, because you will know how filthy she is now. In Baby Cobra, there are gags about anal sex and vaginal secretions; in Hard Knock Wife, there are jokes about the things she would like to do to their nanny if he was 25, male and \u201cnot ugly\u201d.\n\nWhen Wong first performed comedy, she was repeatedly told it was all too much. \u201cAll of these people in the industry kept on telling me: \u2018You\u2019re likable and you\u2019re cute, or whatever, but the jokes are really dirty and you\u2019d get booked a lot more, and you\u2019d be a lot more appealing if they were clean,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe people were half-laughing, half-cringing at my jokes. But if you\u2019re successful, people should be too busy laughing to cringe.\u201d Her jokes may not have got cleaner, but they did get better.\n\nEven now, she says people (men) told her that her material on childbirth and breastfeeding, which made it into her second special, wasn\u2019t interesting enough. \u201cThere was one guy who said: \u2018It was so much better when you were talking about dating because people can\u2019t relate to breastfeeding,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s all I wanted to talk about. That\u2019s kind of the whole point for me with standup, that this is not a network TV sitcom where I have to appeal to everyone.\u201d She pauses for a split second: \u201cI ignored that advice.\u201d\n\nWong is not the first female comic to tell dirty jokes, or talk about sex, but what does feel unusual is her insistence on busting the idea that at the raw, biological level, women aren\u2019t every bit as revolting as men. Why is it still so taboo for women to talk about bodily functions and all the fluids and secretions that ooze out of us? \u201cI was raised to be very open about my body,\u201d she says. Her father was a doctor, and she says her parents were always very straight with her about everything, from sex to the nonexistence of Santa Claus. She thinks for a moment about the question of taboo. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because women feel they want to maintain some mystery that they\u2019re not gross, to be more attractive or something. For me it\u2019s all part of intimacy. That\u2019s how I define intimacy \u2013 living closer and being more honest, closer to what your real desires are \u2013 and it\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nStill, people thank me for making them feel less embarrassed, less ashamed and less sad about having a miscarriage Ali Wong\n\nHer parents have been to her shows. Worse, so have her in-laws. (She is married to Justin Hakuta, who worked for a tech company but gave it up to support her career.) \u201cThat was nerve-racking. I was much less polished then and I think I talked about Japanese porn and how they blur out the genitals, and I did an imitation of a Japanese porn star screaming. That was pretty wild. But they were really supportive.\u201d\n\nI wonder if she is unembarrassable (there are jokes about defecating at work and her promiscuity during her 20s). \u201cNo. For sure, no. I\u2019ll give you an example.\u201d She says that the other day, she and Randall Park, her friend and co-star in Always Be My Maybe, were guest judges on the TV show Top Chef. \u201cI saw his face sort of scrunch up and I was like: \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m so sorry, I think I accidentally farted.\u2019 He moved his chair away from me and he was laughing hysterically, too. It smelled so bad and I was so embarrassed.\u201d She laughs: \u201cI\u2019m definitely embarrassable.\u201d\n\nWhen she had a miscarriage, which she talked about in her first Netflix show, one of her emotions was embarrassment. \u201cI felt a lot of things. I felt sad, but then when I had to tell everybody the news it was something \u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cEmbarrassment is when you wish you didn\u2019t have to tell somebody something, and it wasn\u2019t something I really wanted to share with everybody but I had to because I had bragged that I was pregnant.\u201d There was a huge reaction to Wong talking about her miscarriage at the time. \u201cIt was very taboo for women to talk about miscarriage and it still kind of is. Still to this day, people walk up to me on the street, thanking me for making them feel less embarrassed, less ashamed and less sad about having a miscarriage.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ali Wong onstage in Austin, Texas. Photograph: Rick Kern/WireImage\n\nWong writes that \u201ccomedy requires taking risks\u201d, although she says this is less about subject matter \u2013 nothing is off-limits as long as the joke is well-written \u2013 than about being unafraid of failure. \u201cI guess that\u2019s what I meant about taking risks: for every polished joke you see onstage, there are maybe 100 I tried out that failed. And people in the audience thinking I was a terrible comedian. I was always kind of OK with that.\u201d\n\nAs a child, Wong was funny but, the youngest of four, she was also a quiet observer. \u201cI would say that I grew up listening, a lot. I have vivid memories of details, things people said and how exactly they said them.\u201d She grew up in San Francisco, where her father, born to Chinese parents, was an anaesthetist, and her mother, born in Vietnam, was a social worker. What was it like to write about her family\u2019s experience of being immigrants? \u201cIt was great because I think about it all the time,\u201d she says. Her paternal grandfather came to the US from China as an eight-year-old, travelling alone by ship. \u201cI see kids and how young they really are and I cannot imagine them coming on a boat by themselves, going to another country to work and be separated from their parents. It really humbles me and makes me grateful and it gave me a huge sense of \u2026\u201d She thinks for a second. \u201cIt\u2019s part of my identity and gave me a very strong work ethic.\u201d\n\nA few hours after she got married in San Francisco, Wong performed in her wedding dress at a club in the city; some nights early on in her career, while living in New York, she would perform up to nine sets at different clubs. She has only had four breaks from standup \u2013 her honeymoon, after the births of her two daughters, and when she was shooting the film. These days, once the children are in bed, she turns up unannounced and unpaid at comedy clubs up to five nights a week to try out new material. She describes it as a \u201ccalling. I just really like telling jokes\u201d.\n\nI used to dress like a kid, to desexualise myself. I'd be terrified if my daughters wanted to be standups Ali Wong\n\nShe writes that she has an \u201cunusual amount of Asian pride\u201d. That came from her parents, she says. \u201cA lot of people talk about how they never saw themselves on screen but my parents actively made sure I saw myself on screen all the time. And we had friends who were artists and we would go to their gallery shows.\u201d Now, she says, she makes an effort to see what other Asian American creators are up to \u2013 whether in TV, literature, art or fashion \u2013 and will introduce her children to it. \u201cI think [if you] consume mainstream pop culture and don\u2019t activate a search for any other niche outlets then you can fall into this feeling that you are inferior.\u201d\n\nOne male comic once told her that her career was only taking off because she was female and from an ethnic minority. \u201cThat they have that attitude towards me is an indicator of why they are lacking in success. If you think that is the winning combo for success then you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d Wasn\u2019t it infuriating? \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not. If it was someone that I respected it would really bum me out.\u201d\n\nWhen Wong first started performing, she would wear her hair in two cute buns, and dress in \u201chuge cargo pants\u201d. \u201cI used to dress like a kid, to desexualise myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s the main reason why I would be so terrified if my daughters wanted to be standup comics \u2013 it\u2019s not because of them being onstage, it\u2019s because of the road. You kind of have to go through that.\u201d The comics she respects are the ones who came up through the circuit, rather than those who got famous on a sitcom or YouTube videos. \u201cBut the road is very scary. It always felt unsafe. Even now, when I perform at shows around town, I always ask somebody to walk me back to my car.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ali Wong in a still from her feature film, Always Be My Maybe. Photograph: Ed Araquel/Netflix\n\nWith the #MeToo movement, comedy has come under scrutiny and there have been allegations of sexual harassment made against several male comics. Has Wong ever experienced sexual harassment at work? She is hesitant for a while, trying to find the words. \u201cI think I\u2019m just not ready to share all that stuff yet, but of course there has been not-great stuff that\u2019s happened. So \u2026 yeah. In terms of how things have changed, I guess nowadays the culture has changed, so that when people do some joke that you\u2019ve heard before about women being \u2018naggy\u2019 or something, it just feels dated. A lot of material that would make fun of women that used to be maybe kind of funny doesn\u2019t feel funny any more.\u201d\n\nWong runs jokes about her husband past him before they make it into her shows. \u201cA hilarious joke that performs well in front of strangers but that my husband hates is not worth getting divorced over,\u201d she says. \u201cMy marriage is much more valuable than a great joke.\u201d Does he mind being talked about? \u201cI get asked that all the time but male comics have been making fun of their wives for so long and I wonder if male comics get asked the same thing. This is what standup comics do: they talk about their life and if they have a partner, they talk about their partner. But I don\u2019t feel like male comics are ever asked about what it\u2019s like for their wife.\u201d I think she is right, but a male comic probably would get asked, were he to make jokes, as Wong does, about the most intimate details of their sex life. \u201cRight,\u201d says Wong, with a laugh. \u201cYes, yes. That\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nThe 50 best comedians of the 21st century Read more\n\nWhile her hilarious and unrelenting filthiness is what got Wong noticed, her comedy is full of more nuanced commentary on what it is to be a woman: the double standards of mothering, the pressures of out-earning one\u2019s husband, the reconciliation of bringing up two children under four and doing a job she loves. \u201cI constantly feel like I\u2019m failing at both working and being your mom,\u201d she writes in Dear Girls. In Hard Knock Wife, she talks about the scandal of the US\u2019s lack of paid maternity leave; is she interested in being more political? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says, then, as an aside: \u201cAs a British person, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s just so barbaric that we don\u2019t give maternity leave?\u201d Topical, political jokes, she says, have \u201cnever been my forte. I\u2019m also a little bit intimidated because there are so many other comics who are so good at that.\u201d She is well placed to skewer it in the current climate in the US, increasingly hostile to immigrants, but doesn\u2019t seem sure if she wants to go there. Still, she points out, by doing what she loves and doing it well, \u201ceven me putting myself out there sometimes is political. You know what I mean? Some people can\u2019t stand that.\u201d\n\nDear Girls is out today, published by Canongate, available for \u00a313.19 from Guardian Bookshop.", "description": "The standup behind Baby Cobra found fame with her candid material on sex and pregnancy.
