The Eagles took on multiple injuries in that game, and that\u2019s still lingering this week.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe team is so banged up, coach Doug Pederson took the rare step of calling off practice on Wednesday.\n\nEagles have long injury list\n\nThe Eagles shifted to a walkthrough on Wednesday instead, which they did late last season according to Zach Berman of The Athletic. But that was in the final weeks of a long season. To call off practice in Week 3 is unusual.\n\nHoward Eskin of 94 WIP said the change in practice schedule was due to injuries and a game on artificial surface. The Eagles needed a rest.\n\nThe injury list was long after Sunday\u2019s game. Receivers Alshon Jeffery and DeSean Jackson were injured, missed most of the game and probably won\u2019t play this week either. Tight end Dallas Goedert injured his calf in pregame warmups and didn\u2019t play. Quarterback Carson Wentz took a lot of punishment, though he finished the game. Center Jason Kelce had to be checked out, though he returned too. Defensive tackle Tim Jernigan suffered a foot injury and could miss a month or more.\n\nAnd there are 15 weeks to go this regular season.\n\nEagles face Detroit on Sunday\n\nThe Eagles play the Detroit Lions on Sunday. We\u2019ll see who can suit up.\n\nPhiladelphia came into the season with high hopes, but the start of the season has been a struggle. The Eagles had to rally after a slow start in Week 1 to beat Washington, then lost in Week 2 while injuries piled up. All the while the Dallas Cowboys have started 2-0 in the NFC East with a game against the terrible Miami Dolphins on deck.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Eagles seem to be in a bit of survival mode already, which isn\u2019t a great sign in mid-September.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles head coach Doug Pederson watches play against the Atlanta Falcons during the first half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Sept. 15, 2019, in Atlanta.
