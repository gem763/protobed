Even more than we knew. It isn\u2019t just that he hovered over the Democratic debate on Thursday night: should the candidates attack him or leave him to self-destruct?\n\nWere they talking about him too much or not enough? It\u2019s more profound than that. Donald Trump has fundamentally altered the way we experience politics. We\u2019ve been trying to figure out for three years if he is a mad aberration, doomed to fade, or if he is rewiring the game in some permanent way.\n\nWatching that depressing debate, one must conclude that the rewiring is well under way. Trump is one of the phoniest people ever to walk the Earth. Maybe that\u2019s why he was uniquely suited to tear through the phony conventions and bloated world of consultants that made up politics as usual.\n\nYou know that the barbarian behind the White House gates will run with all the ammunition the Democrats were supplying him in real time\n\nThere were a lot of good politicians on the debate stage in Houston. But the night rang hollow as they clung to the old conventions \u2013 the overcoached performances, the canned lines, the pandering, the well-worn childhood anecdotes meant to project \u201crelatability\u201d.\n\nTactics superseded passion and vision. Everyone seemed one tick off. Unlike with Barack Obama in 2008, none made you feel like you wanted to pump your fist in the air and march into the future behind them.\n\n\u201cBeing a good politician doesn\u2019t matter anymore,\u201d lamented one freaked-out congressional Democrat afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s like being a great used-car salesman. We need a Holden Caulfield to call out all the phonies.\u201d\n\nLight bulbs\n\nIt\u2019s a paradox wrapped in an oxymoron about a moron: Trump\u2019s faux-thenticity somehow makes the Democratic candidates seem more packaged, more stuck in politician-speak. In speeches and at rallies, Trump kicks over the traces, saying what\u2019s on his mind, even though it often doesn\u2019t mesh with reality, even though it lacks dignity and can be ugly and hateful.\n\nJust consider his speech at the House Republican retreat in Baltimore, happening at the same time as the debate. Basking in chants of \u201cFour more years!\u201d Trump unleashed several buzzwords and crowd-pleasers, trashing eco-friendly paper straws and energy-efficient light bulbs.\n\n\u201cThe bulb that we\u2019re being forced to use \u2013 number one, to me, most importantly, the light is no good,\u201d he said. \u201cI always look orange. And so do you. The light is the worst. But, number two, it\u2019s many times more expensive than that old incandescent bulb that worked very well. And very importantly \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you know this \u2013 they have warnings. If it breaks, it\u2019s considered a hazardous waste site. It\u2019s gases inside.\n\nThe candidates struggled to alchemise our exhaustion into excitement\n\n\u201cAnd,\u201d the Narcissus president repeated a couple of times for good measure, \u201cthe light is not as good. I mean, frankly, the light is not as good.\u201d He offered his usual aria of insults to the assembled shameless Republicans, calling Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d and Joe Biden \u201cSleepy Joe.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now it looks like she could beat Sleepy Joe,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s fallen asleep. He has no idea what the hell he\u2019s doing or saying.\u201d\n\nHe made a Pete Buttigieg short joke and referred to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as \u201cCortez\u201d because her name, he said, is too long. He called the squad \u201cAOC plus three\u201d and warned of the \u201cgrim spectre of socialism\u201d.\n\nHe mocked the Green New Deal, saying: \u201cThat\u2019s a beauty. No more cows. No more planes. I guess no more people, right?\u201d Then he teased Kevin McCarthy, House Republican leader: \u201cBecause Kevin is just like a cow. He\u2019s just smaller.\u201d\n\nAmmunition\n\nThe split screen on Thursday night was riveting. You know that the barbarian behind the White House gates will run with all the ammunition the Democrats were supplying him in real time.\n\nThe president said, \u201cDemocrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans,\u201d and Beto O\u2019Rourke said, \u201cHell, yes, we are going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d The president said the Democrats would impose \u201ccrippling taxes,\u201d and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren proposed all their free stuff that would require tax hikes.\n\nThis exact display from Trump is just what many Americans find exhausting. It\u2019s draining to live on the edge all the time, to be plunged into the culture wars \u2013 and now the straw and light-bulb wars \u2013 with the tweets and the tantrums and the put-downs, to feel that we\u2019re being borne back ceaselessly into the past.\n\nBut how to counter this? \u201cNo one made the broadest, most appealing message for change,\u201d David Axelrod said of the debate. \u201cCan we, as a country, function anymore if we have another four years of waking up to turmoil?\u201d\n\nThere were a bunch of high-end, professional pols there and yet no one actually won it. Not a good sign. The candidates struggled to alchemise our exhaustion into excitement.\n\nThe three hours seemed endless, with two questions hanging over the night: \u201cCan\u2019t anybody here play this game?\u201d and \u201cWill the most beatable candidate in American history win twice?\u201d \u2013 New York Times", "description": "Democratic debate shows how president has altered the way US experiences politics", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4018831&origw=1199", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
