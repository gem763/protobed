During the early 2010s, the United States ignored Poland entirely, but Huawei made a long-term commitment, and built the country\u2019s entire telecommunications infrastructure. To exclude Huawei at this point would be disruptive as well as prohibitively expensive. Besides, the official explained, Poland\u2019s economic future was bound up with China\u2019s. Its flagship national project, an enormous new airport 40 kilometers east of Warsaw, will be \u201cChina\u2019s gateway to the continent.\u201d\n\nThat is the background to Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s appearance in Poland on Tuesday to sign a \u201csecurity pact\u201d requiring \u201crigorous review\u201d of telecommunications suppliers, that is, Huawei. The pact declares, \u201cWe believe that all countries must ensure that only trusted and reliable suppliers participate in our networks to protect them from unauthorized access or interference.\u201d\n\nOne strains to recall another such \u201csecurity pact,\u201d or to comprehend just what such a pact means in terms of diplomacy. It obligates the Poles to nothing except a formal review process. Germany\u2019s telecom regulator undertook such a review process and declared last April that \u201cno equipment supplier, including Huawei, should, or may, be specifically excluded.\u201d German and Chinese government and industry sources report that the Chinese telecom giant persuaded the German government that its 5G technology would not enable China to spy on the Germans, but rather would prevent the United States from doing so. A senior German official is said to have told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that Germany was not aware of China tapping Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s mobile phone, as the US reportedly did in 2013.\n\nAmerica\u2019s effort to dissuade its allies from using Huawei\u2019s superior 5G technology has for the most part failed dismally, and Pence\u2019s Polish charade looks like a public relations exercise for purposes of damage control.\n\nWhile Pence went to Poland, Merkel and a large delegation of German business leaders are preparing to fly to Beijing for three days of meetings. Public sentiment in Germany is focused on the Hong Kong protests, and Merkel will be obliged to represent German concerns about Beijing\u2019s crackdown on demonstrators to her Chinese hosts. Nonetheless, the German business daily Handelsblatt reported, \u201cGerman businesses nonetheless are hoping for breakthroughs in an agreement [with China].\u201d Friedolin Strack, the head of the German industry federation\u2019s Asia task force, explained to the South China Morning Post, \u201cThe world economy is not in the best condition, and many markets have become more difficult for various reasons \u2026 China\u2019s economic growth slowed only a little and is of increasing importance to our companies.\u201d\n\nGermany appears resigned to China\u2019s ascent as an economic and strategic power, although Germany continues to view the Asian giant with trepidation. The front page of Germany\u2019s leading pro-Merkel daily Die Welt today is dominated by a report on America\u2019s \u201cstrategic bankruptcy\u201d in the face of China\u2019s growing military power. Christopher Schlitz\u2019s commentary rehearses the widely-reported study released last week by the United States Studies Center of the University of Sydney, which concluded that Chinese precision missiles could destroy virtually all American strategic assets in Asia in a matter of hours. That isn\u2019t news. The late Andrew Marshall, then director of the Pentagon\u2019s Office of Strategic Assessment, told me as much in 2015. The news is that the news has been acknowledged. The authors of the Sydney study, Schlitz reports, \u201cdoubt that the US will be able to respond in the right way to Chinese military preparations, due to the lack of modern weapons system, sufficient training and deployment readiness.\u201d\n\nIf the American military is deficient, Germany\u2019s is prostrate. During part of 2019 Germany could not put a single military helicopter in the air, and no more than four of its Tornado fighters at any given time. Only 18% of Germans told a 2017 Gallup poll that they were willing to fight to defend their country. Merkel will give lip service to human rights in Hong Kong, and complain about predatory Chinese acquisitions of German businesses, but her mission in Beijing is to expand German trade with China and to give German companies more access to the Chinese market.\n\nThat leaves the United States with little wiggle room, and Pence few choices except Poland. The Poles are friendly to Trump and anxious to accommodate, and evidently were happy to stage today\u2019s masquerade. But the exercise recalls Soviet-era jokes about Russia and Poland, of which my favorite follows:\n\nBrezhnev plans a state visit to Poland, and wants to give the Polish people a mural on the subject. \u201cLenin In Poland.\u201d The trouble is that Lenin never visited Poland in an official capacity, and the Socialist Realist painters only know how to work from archive photos. Brezhnev orders his secretary Krakpotkin to come up with a painting nonetheless. In desperation, Krakpotkin goes to Rabinowitz, a refusenik starving to death in a garret. \u201cPaint me Lenin in Poland,\u201d says Krakpotkin, \u201cand I\u2019ll get you a visa to Israel.\u201d\n\nThe day before Brezhnev is scheduled to leave, Rabinowitz arrives at Brezhnev\u2019s office in the Kremlin with an enormous canvas covered in a drop cloth. He removes the covering, and there is a picture of a man in bed with a woman.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?,\u201d asks Brezhnev.\n\nRabinowitz replies, \u201cThat\u2019s Trotsky.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s the woman?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Krupskaya [Lenin\u2019s wife],\u201d says Rabinowitz.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Lenin?,\u201d Brezhnev demands.\n\nRabinowitz takes a long drag on his cigarette and says: \u201cLenin\u2019s in Poland.\u201d\n\nThis time, it\u2019s Pence.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Asia Times.", "description": "A senior Polish official explained to me recently why his .09/06/2019 8:09:13AM EST.", "authors": ["David P.
