Warren\u2019s campaign has covered, as she pointed out onstage, a hundred and forty town halls, twenty-seven states, and seventy thousand selfies. She has been the only candidate to dramatically change her prospects in the race, rising over the past year until she was leading in the betting markets, roughly even with the former Vice-President Joe Biden in the national polls, and edging ahead of him in Iowa and New Hampshire. Most significantly, Warren established the basic ethos of the Democratic primary: that it would be not only for the displacement of President Trump but also\u2014in her awkward, effective phrase\u2014\u201cbig, structural change.\u201d (If that sounded both grand and a little hazy, so has the Democratic primary.) The tactical question going into Tuesday night was who might try to attack Warren, and how effective they might be. The deeper matter was to what extent the Democratic Party has remade itself in her image.\n\nThe moderators bored in on Warren early. Marc Lacey, the New York Times\u2019 national editor, noted that Bernie Sanders had acknowledged that his Medicare for All plan would raise some taxes on the middle class. Lacey asked whether Warren, who supported the same plan, would make the same concession. She wouldn\u2019t. She repeated what she called \u201cmy principles\u201d: that costs would go up for corporations and the wealthy, and not ordinary Americans. But Sanders has suggested that Medicare for All will cost \u201cmore than thirty trillion dollars over ten years,\u201d as Biden pointed out, in a country whose annual federal budget is less than five trillion dollars. A fireman and a schoolteacher making a hundred thousand dollars between them, Biden went on, would see their taxes go up by more than ten thousand dollars each year. Warren pivoted. She spoke of Americans who\u2019d got sick, believing that they had good health insurance, only to watch as \u201cthe insurance company pulled the rug out from under them.\u201d She described Medicare for All as the \u201cgold standard,\u201d and the only way to get health insurance to all Americans who needed it. But the more Warren circled back, explaining the way she saw the morality of the issue, the more plainly reluctant she seemed to say that big, structural change had a price tag, and that it might not be borne only by the billionaires. \u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here,\u201d Amy Klobuchar said. Pete Buttigieg addressed Warren more directly. \u201cYour signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this: no plan has been laid out to explain how the trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan . . . is supposed to get filled in.\u201d\n\nIt was a good line, and Buttigieg had plenty of them. He is not always the most memorable debater, but he can hold both policy details and political positioning in his head at once, a rare skill. But there was a subtle shift in the campaign on Tuesday night, one that was not directly caused by Buttigieg but that may, in the end, benefit him. For most of the Presidential race, the candidates have positioned themselves for and against Bernie Sanders\u2019s ideas, most often Medicare for All. Warren\u2019s campaign has been tactically savvy in that she has sufficiently embraced Sanders\u2019s expansive view of government in order to blunt the threat that he might have posed from her left (the tactics of a real pol, whatever her reputation as an idealist), while defining her campaign through an onslaught of policy.\n\nBut, as the twelve candidates onstage moved briskly past health insurance, the debate took on a different theme: not Biden versus Warren but Professor Warren versus the old Democratic Party. Kamala Harris chastised the debate moderators for a lack of attention to \u201cwomen\u2019s access to reproductive-health care, which is under full-on attack\u201d\u2014a reminder of how Democrats had often spoken about health care in the past. When Warren said that automation was not stripping jobs out of the Midwest (\u201cThe data show that we have a lot of problems with losing jobs, but the principal reason has been bad trade policy\u201d), Cory Booker responded by speaking in favor of unions, a higher minimum wage, and the dignity of work\u2014sturdy Democratic standbys.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an awful night for Warren. To her credit, she resisted joining Harris\u2019s frankly alarming call for Twitter to suspend President Trump\u2019s account, and yet ably used the example of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to argue that the structural change she seeks isn\u2019t na\u00efve. But, by evening\u2019s end, she seemed a narrower candidate than she had at the beginning. When Warren was asked about the progressive plan to introduce a federal wealth tax, she said that the question should not be why she and Sanders supported the idea but why \u201ceverybody else on the stage thinks it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of America.\u201d That sounded overly defensive, especially since the billionaire Tom Steyer had just attacked the economic system as rigged toward the top. \u201cNot even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires,\u201d Klobuchar pointed out. When the topic turned to Syria, where Trump has withdrawn U.S. troops, leaving Kurdish allies to face a Turkish military offensive, Warren made a slightly philosophical point: \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have troops in the Middle East.\u201d It fell to Buttigieg to defend the ethic of service, and the honor of allegiance. When he\u2019d served in Afghanistan, he said, even the local janitors had put their lives on the line to support the American intervention. \u201cI would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye,\u201d he said.\n\nButtigieg ended the night in an interesting position. His campaign has been at once successful and a little formless; though his candidacy has risen from the fringe to the ranks of the plausible challengers, through his talent and ability to raise funds, his message is a little hard to discern. His pragmatic disposition is complicated by his efforts not to miss the boat on big, structural change\u2014for instance, by backing an expansion of the Supreme Court. But his experience, as a military veteran in particular, extends to subjects that Warren\u2019s simply doesn\u2019t, and he is as good at drawing contrasts as anyone. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg snapped at Beto O\u2019Rourke, the subtext being that he had served while the Texan had not. Perhaps there is an opening for him as the candidate of the pre\u00ebxisting Democratic Party rather than of those who would transform it. There is an opening for someone there, at least. Warren is the strongest candidate in the field. She also aims to hitch the Democrats to an agenda of sweeping economic transformation that the Party has not yet fully debated. Perhaps that began on Tuesday night. By the end, it didn\u2019t seem like Warren\u2019s party\u2014not just yet.", "description": "Benjamin Wallace-Wells writes on Elizabeth Warren\u2019s rise in the Democratic Presidential-primary race, and to what extent the Party has embraced her ideas.", "authors": ["Benjamin Wallace-Wells", "Alexandra Schwartz", "Charles Duhigg", "Jeffrey Toobin", "Susan Orlean", "Hashem Shakeri", "Eric Lach"], "top_image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5da673a555ace4000926a99c/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/BWW-DebateWarrenLeader.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
