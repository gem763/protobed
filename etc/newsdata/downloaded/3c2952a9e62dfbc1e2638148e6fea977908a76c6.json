Children have died, people have died. ... We're going to have some very strong rules, regulations, and more important, I think we're going to have some very important information come out very shortly.

These products have not been.\"\n\nAzar said the reason the e-cigarettes made it to the market in general even though they aren't approved is that the Trump administration, as well as the Obama administration, exercised what they call \"enforcement discretion.\" What that means is they took a step back and let them get on the market so that cigarette smokers could access the products while the vaping companies prepared their FDA paperwork.\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\"But we always said if we find that kids become the users of these products, you're going to have to stop and you're going to have to go through regular order and submit your applications to us in order to be on the market, and that's what we're doing,\" Azar said.", "description": "The CEO of Juul stepped down and the CDC is warning people to avoid e-cigarettes entirely due to its possible link to a mysterious lung illness.", "authors": ["Blair Shiff"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Vaping.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
