Despite Booker\u2019s optimism about bipartisan constitutional obligations, interest in impeachment has so far fallen along party lines.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/76/1d/89d23a804d4d95f3083b6e9593d4/trumpimpeachment.jpg\"\n\nBut Booker said that some Republican colleagues \u2014 namely Sens. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Mitt Romney of Utah \u2014 had already taken a \u201csobered, thoughtful perspective\u201d on the matter, and that Republicans might break ranks with the president if public opinion shifted in favor of impeachment.\n\nSasse said Wednesday that \u201cthere\u2019s obviously lots that\u2019s very troubling\u201d in the complaint and the official read-out of the call that the White House released, but he castigated Democrats for pursuing impeachment before they had access to the complaint. Romney has expressed similar sentiments.\n\nBooker and other Democrats have rooted their assertions that Republicans will come around on impeachment in the obvious historical precedent \u2014 as more information became public about the Watergate scandal and President Richard Nixon\u2019s role in obscuring the truth, his support among even staunch Republican defenders in Congress eroded. Moreover, by the time the House Judiciary Committee voted on impeachment, Nixon\u2019s popularity had hit bedrock and the majority of Americans supported impeachment.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/bf/ce/b34ba7e3415cadaace1491e9dfb6/190926-cory-booker-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
