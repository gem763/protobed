However, we wanted to find out from the industry\u2019s experts what trends in digital assets they think are rocking the Cryptoworld this year.\n\nCryptonews.com had a chance to talk with the representatives of a few major companies in the field of cryptocurrency and blockchain, who attended this year\u2019s Baltic Honeybadger conference held in September in Riga, Latvia. Based on their answers, we\u2019ve compiled a list of 10 main trends in digital assets this year.\n\nWatch the interviews or read a quick summary below:\n\n1. Ongoing experiments and failures\n\nThe industry is young, so it's no wonder that many of its aspects are still in the experimental / trial-and-error stage. \u201cThis entire space is still experimental,\u201d told us Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of crypto security specialist Casa, Jameson Lopp. However, he points out that there are cases when somebody has an idea that others like, but there wouldn\u2019t be any cooperation, as they \u201cwant to do that themselves with their own twist,\u201d says the CTO. But \u201cthat works well until the hype reaches the point that\u2019s not sustainable anymore and it all crashes back down,\u201d he adds.\n\nLearn more: USD 133m Stablecoin Basis is Closing Down\n\n2. ICO and IEO decline\n\nSpeaking of potential failures, one of the trends many representatives we\u2019ve talked to agree on is that the days of ICOs (initial coin offerings) and IEOs (initial exchange offerings) seem to be fewer. \u201cIt seems like the Wild West ICO boom is over,\u201d says Lopp, and people are trying other variations now, \"some of which are trying to work more within the existing system for tokens.\"\n\nThe market is evaluating the solutions that already exist, says Chief Information Officer (CIO) at blockchain technology group Bitfury, Alex Petrov, and while the useful projects may gain more support, many ICOs and altcoins that don\u2019t have users and don\u2019t solve any problems may not survive.\n\nOn the other hand, Samson Mow, Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) at the U.S.-based blockchain company Blockstream, believes that \u201cthere will always be ICOs and IEOs,\u201d but that the trend is on the decline \u201cbecause investors are starting to smarten up a little bit and realize there is no security backing this token\u201d and no legal protection either.\n\nOn a similar note, Dan Held, Director of Business Development at Kraken added that the 2018 bear market \u201cshook out a lot of the poorer-quality assets and [\u2026] bandwagon fans [who were] just kind of coming into the space to take the advantage of the irrational exuberance [...], and now we're seeing serious people building real things.\u201d\n\nLearn more: Has the IEO Craze Already Fizzled Out?\n\n3. Run your own node\n\n\u201cRun your own node\u201d is one of the biggest trends this year, says Francis Pouliot, CEO and co-founder of Canadian Bitcoin company Bull Bitcoin. While not particularly popular in 2014 and 2015, running your own full node is \u201cbecoming cool [and] fashionable.\u201d As examples, the CEO mentions many photos and screenshots people have taken of their own nodes to share with others. Yet, most of these projects \u201chave been going on for only a year or year and a half, so this is a very new trend,\u201d says the CEO. \u201cThe narrative has shifted,\u201d says Pouliot, given that before people would say that you need to have a custodian if you want bitcoin to be accepted by the mainstream, but now they say you should do self-custody.\n\nLearn more: Your Node, Your Keys, Your Bitcoin: Raspberry Pi\n\n4. Privacy\n\nPrivacy has always been at the center of people\u2019s attention, but it might be more so now than ever. Pouliot notes that the custodians are becoming more sophisticated at using multi-signature, but he also gives examples of projects taking off, such as CoinJoin, JoinMarket, Wasabi Wallet, and Samourai Wallet, saying that we\u2019re now seeing an increased number of transactions from them.\n\nLearn more: 15 Online Tools for Crypto-Anarchists, Privacy Advocates, And Agorists\n\n5. More regulated security-type tokens\n\nMajor players in the crypto and blockchain industry also think that \u201cthe trend that is coming is going to be security tokens,\u201d as Mow says. That's the reason behind Blockstream\u2019s collaborations with different security token offering platforms, he explains. The company is in talks with some new exchanges that are being launched and that will support security tokens, but we\u2019re still \u201c1-2 years away before it really gets big and hyped up,\u201d he says. (As reported, according to Carlos Domingo, founder and CEO of security token platform Securitize, the STO market is estimated to grow this year, but at a steady rate - and the explosion might come some time until 2021.)\n\nLearn more: Dominican Republic Citizenship Advertised as Benefit to STO Investors\n\n6. Lightning Network\n\nLightning Network has been the talk of the town for a while now. The experts seem to agree that it has advanced over time. Jameson told us that \u201cthe Lightning side has definitely evolved a lot over the past year,\u201d and the growth can be seen \u201cin the system, both at the network and the protocol level.\u201d That\u2019s not all, as the economy around it is \u201creally growing up [\u2026] in various services and applications that are tying into the Lightning Network.\u201d\n\nLearn more: The Lightning Network: Challenges and Solutions\n\n7. Institutional adoption\n\nThe Cryptoverse has seen numerous discussions over the possibility of the institutional adoption of crypto and blockchain and its potential benefits. Though it\u2019ll take a while, Held finds that \u201cmaybe we'll finally see some trickle of institutional adoption,\u201d especially with the macro backdrop of the upcoming 2020 U.S. presidential election, the current president tweeting at the Federal Reserve, various social and economic issues across the world, and the Bitcoin mining reward halving in 2020 as well, Held told us.\n\nLearn more: 'Big Growth Opportunity': Billionaire Builds USD 1Bn Crypto Venture\n\n8. The effect of the economic crisis\n\nSpeaking of different economic situations, Petrov too finds that they have an effect on the Cryptoverse. \u201cThe economic situation right now is facing the third wave of a coming crisis,\u201d he says, and \u201cit can play a huge role,\u201d by pushing up cryptocurrencies to \u201cgrow up\u201d and solving a lot of problems for the existing financial system. \u201cThe crisis affects everyone, so it\u2019s not simply about just companies, but also about the individuals. There are no exclusions,\u201d says the CIO.\n\nLearn more: What a Possible Global Recession Could Mean for Crypto\n\n9. Bitcoin getting ready for a boom\n\nAnd while many are certainly hoping for a BTC boom, Held thinks that \u201cwe're due\u201d for \u201canother bull cycle here in 2020.\u201d What's changed is the macro backdrop, he says, and \u201cBitcoin is getting primed and ready to go for that, while the world is undergoing a little bit of uncertainty, a little bit of chaos.\"\n\nLearn more: Bitcoin Price: Cryptoverse is Trying to Guess the Next Move\n\n10. Bitcoin maximalism\n\nThe final trend is another long-runner that might have picked up some speed lately. Pouliot says that one of the biggest trends he has seen is just generally Bitcoin Maximalism, which he describes as \u201ca philosophical, very active movement,\u201d whereby currency becomes a win-or-lose market. \u201cThere\u2019s gonna be one dominant currency in the end,\u201d says Pouliot, \u201cand the idea of the multicurrency universe is fading away,\u201d adding that \u201cwe should focus our efforts back to Bitcoin. I think this is becoming a big narrative.\u201d He further explains that a number of projects and companies have recently become \u201cBTC only,\u201d offering BTC-only products and stating that they will not be working with other currencies in the future either.\n\n\u201cSo if I recommend another company, I prefer to recommend a Bitcoin-only company, because I know that they are not going to screw over my user by shilling down some shitcoins down their throat,\u201d the CEO told us.\n\nLearn more: Has the Bitcoin-Ethereum Rivalry Hit New Heights of Hostility?", "description": "The Cryptoverse has certainly seen its fair share of trends over the years, both short and long-lasting.
