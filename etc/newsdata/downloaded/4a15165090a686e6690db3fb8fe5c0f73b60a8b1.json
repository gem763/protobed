The Liberal candidates were all in British Columbia and Alberta, while the Conservatives were in Ontario and Quebec. The NDP lost one candidate in Manitoba and two in Atlantic Canada.\n\nReplacement candidates did worse in 2015\n\nBy comparing the results in each of the ridings where a candidate was replaced to those in the rest of the region where that party's candidates were not replaced, we get an idea of how these replacements performed.\n\nOn average, parties did 3.2 percentage points worse in ridings where they replaced a candidate compared with other ridings in the same region where they did not.\n\nIn the B.C. riding of South Surrey-White Rock, for example, the Liberals dropped a candidate over comments related to pregnancy and marijuana use. Her replacement improved on the Liberals' 2011 score in the riding by 22 points. But other Liberal candidates in the Fraser Valley and southern Lower Mainland experienced an average gain of 27 points.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer says he will stand by candidates with racist, homophobic past comments as long as they apologize. 0:27\n\nWhile that is one case, it is a pattern that was repeated over nine of the 13 ridings in which a candidate was replaced. In only three ridings did the replacement do better than other candidates in the region, but only by a marginal amount of about a point or two. Most of the under-achieving replacements did between three and seven points worse than their neighbouring colleagues.\n\nDid this have an impact on the outcome of the election? Probably not. Only in South Surrey-White Rock was the margin narrow enough that the loss of the original candidate might have cost the party a victory. But there were 47 ridings across Canada decided by 3.2 percentage points or less \u2014 suggesting that a last-minute loss of a candidate in any of these ridings could have made the difference.\n\nWhy replacing a candidate can hurt\n\nThere are several reasons why the loss of a local candidate could have a negative impact \u2014 it reflects badly on the party and erases much of the work that might have been done by that candidate in the riding before the writs were dropped. A replacement might come in with less name recognition and the party's local organization could be disrupted.\n\nBut the marginal gains to be made by forcing a local candidate to be replaced might be over-shadowed by the wider impacts on the campaign. Instead of talking about climate change, May was forced to spend her first campaign days answering questions on abortion and Quebec sovereignty.\n\nInstead of hammering home the Conservatives' message on affordability, Scheer has had to dismiss as distractions the latest controversies dug up by the Liberal opposition research team.\n\nThere are only 35 days left for leaders to make their pitch to voters \u2014 they can't afford to lose a single day.\n\nSo expect more of these unsavoury comments by candidates to be re-surfaced. And the worst might be yet to come. After Oct. 2, the ballots will be sent off to the printers \u2014 and parties will be stuck with the names that are on them.\n\nStream the latest episode below and subscribe to The Pollcast with \u00c9ric Grenier here.", "description": "Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is sticking by his candidates while Green Leader Elizabeth May is re-vetting hers.
