When the judge had asked him earlier if he could hear what was being said in the courtroom, he replied \u201cOh yeah!\u201d\n\nAfter the hearing, Wasseim Alsati, who was shot three times and whose 4-year-old daughter was also shot and injured, said Tarrant was manipulating the court system by pleading not guilty and then mocking the proceedings.\n\n\u201cHe was laughing, smiling, and not even give any respect to the courtroom or to the judges,\u201d Alsati said. \u201cThis is really bad behavior. Really unacceptable behavior.\u201d\n\nAlsati said he and most of the other victims had been prepared to travel to Auckland for the trial, if necessary, and so were happy it would be held in Christchurch. Auckland is about 765 kilometers (475 miles) north of Christchurch.\n\n\u201cOtherwise I will end up travelling every court time, and that\u2019s going to be an extra cost for all the victims,\u201d he said.\n\nAlsati and others who showed up for the hearing had been expecting to hear arguments from defense lawyers about why the trial should be moved and to hear counter-arguments from prosecution lawyers. Without those arguments, the hearing lasted about 10 minutes.\n\nLegal experts had earlier told The Associated Press that defense lawyers were likely to argue that a jury pool from Christchurch would be tainted because the mosque shootings happened so close to home, while prosecutors were likely to counter that all New Zealanders were deeply affected and any shift of venue would place an undue travel burden on survivors and relatives.\n\nSince the March attacks, New Zealand has changed its gun laws to ban assault weapons. It has also launched a review that will examine, among other issues, how Tarrant failed to get the attention of law enforcement or intelligence agencies before the attacks.\n\nTarrant\u2019s trial has been scheduled for next June.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
