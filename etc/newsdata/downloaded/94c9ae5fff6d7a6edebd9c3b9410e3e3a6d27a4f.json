The FPC judges that such a system would need to meet the highest standards of resilience and be subject to appropriate supervisory oversight, consistent with the principles set out above.'\n\n'The terms of engagement for innovations such as Libra must be adopted in advance of any launch. UK authorities should use their powers accordingly.'\n\nThe ongoing trade war between America and China is also a major concern for the Bank. It said: 'Following the latest announcements, average bilateral tariffs between the United States and China are around 20 per cent higher than at the start of 2018.'\n\n'These tariffs \u2013 and the uncertainty associated with intensifying trade tensions \u2013 have contributed to slowing global growth and are likely to weigh on global growth in the coming quarters.'", "description": "The Bank's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) said major UK banks and insurers are 'strong enough' to cope and will continue lending to customers and businesses.", "authors": ["Alex Sebastian For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
