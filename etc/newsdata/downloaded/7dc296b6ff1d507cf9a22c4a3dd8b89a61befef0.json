It includes a children's playground, curved walkways that act as modern 'back alleys', and several communal gardens\n\nThe development comes with generous communal spaces, intended to improve community relations, and is made up of cream bricks and black roof tiles.\n\nIn reference to Norwich's Dutch trading links, it also has south-facing windows to make the most of sunlight.\n\nParking has been pushed to the outer edges of the estate, something praised by judges, while a wide landscaped walkway for communal gatherings runs through the site.\n\nAlan Jones, the Riba president, said: 'Faced with the worst housing crisis for generations and crippling local authority cuts, Goldsmith Street is a beacon of hope.\n\n'It is commended not just as a transformative housing scheme and eco-development but a pioneering exemplar for other local authorities to follow.'\n\nJudges, chaired by Julia Barfield, praised its eco-friendly design.\n\nThey said: 'Goldsmith Street is a modest masterpiece. It is high-quality architecture in its purest, most environmentally and socially-conscious form.\n\n'Behind restrained creamy facades are impeccably-detailed, highly sustainable homes - an incredible achievement for a development of this scale.\n\n'This is proper social housing, over 10 years in the making, delivered by an ambitious and thoughtful council.\n\n'These desirable, spacious, low-energy properties should be the norm for all council housing.'\n\nAlan Jones, the Riba president, said: 'Faced with the worst housing crisis for generations and crippling local authority cuts, Goldsmith Street is a beacon of hope'\n\nThe Goldsmith Street project consists of seven terraces modelled on houses in the Victorian Golden Triangle district of Norwich\n\nDavid Mikhail, of Goldsmith Street designers Mikhail Riches, said: 'Goldsmith Street's success is testimony to the vision and leadership of Norwich City Council. We thank them for their commitment and support. They believe that council housing tenants deserve great design.\n\n'It is not often we are appointed to work on a project so closely aligned with what we believe matters; buildings people love which are low impact.\n\n'We hope other local authorities will be inspired to deliver beautiful homes for people who need them the most, and at an affordable price.\n\n'To all the residents - thank you for sharing your enthusiasm, and your homes, with everyone who has visited.'\n\nHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick said: 'A huge congratulations to Norwich City Council for their winning Goldsmith Street development.\n\nIt is the largest Passivhaus scheme in the UK, whereby insulation and light-absorbing materials mean the properties do not rely on any fuel-heating methods, and are instead 'passively' heated by things like the sun and humans inside the properties\n\n'I want to see the delivery of better-designed homes, especially social housing like the gold standard set in Norwich, and expect more developers to follow the example set by the project's architects Mikhail Riches and Cathy Hawley.'\n\nA theme of reuse and recycle appeared to dominate this year's field, with the cork house and rail station reusing or recycling materials.\n\nRIBA President Ben Derbyshire said all the designs show grand ambition and commitment: 'What they have in common \u2013 ground-breaking innovation, extraordinary creativity and the highest-quality materials and detailing \u2013 sets them apart, rightfully earning them a chance to win the highest accolade in architecture. We must encourage their architectural ambition, innovation, bravery and skill.\n\n'From the way that Cork House experiments with entirely plant-based materials, to Goldsmith Street's ultra-low energy affordable homes, each of these six buildings pushes the boundaries of architecture, exceeding what has been done before, and providing solutions to some of the most pressing challenges of our times.'\n\nReaction to this year's nominees has been largely positive compared to criticism placed on 2018's winner.\n\nBloomberg's European headquarters in London, which cost an eye-watering \u00a31.3bn, drew negative reactions due to its lavish design and anti rough sleeper seating, which was not seen as being in touch with the housing crisis affecting the rest of London.\n\nTHE OTHER NOMINEES\n\nLondon Bridge Station\n\nHome to thousands of commuters every day since 1836, London Bridge was the only London building project nominated this year. Last year it reopened following a \u00a31 billion transformation, with a shiny new 15-platform concourse and lower-level shopping centre.\n\nIt has been rebuilt three times before, in 1849 and 1864 and once again in a extensive re-fit during the 1970s while changing tracks and signalling. Completed in January last year, the project by Grimshaw Architects is the biggest railway upgrade since Victorian times.\n\nThe \u00a31 billion transformation of London Bridge station, the largest rail upgrade since Victorian times which finished last year, is the only nominee from the capital to make it this far\n\nLondon Bridge's main concourse was reopened last year for the first time since 2012.

Made entirely by hand, the structure is 'designed for disassembly' so that materials can be reused\n\nThe pyramidal roofs and walls are all designed to be disassembled, meaning the materials can all be reused or recycled in the future\n\nThe contemporary home is dominated by natural materials, and during the day uses natural light that pours through the Aztec-pyramidal roof holes to avoid using electricity\n\nNevill Holt Opera, Leicestershire\n\nHaled as an 'indisputable triumph', the Nevill Holt Opera is considered to be among the most unique opera houses in the country. Housed inside a converted 17th-century stable block, the new theatre space opened in June last year, winning four RIBA awards.\n\nThe theatre makes the most of its intimate space and mixes old elements like its ironstone walls with a new rectangular roof and balcony.
