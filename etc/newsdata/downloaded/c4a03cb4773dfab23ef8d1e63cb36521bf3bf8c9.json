(Filming at the site will require permission to be requested at least three weeks in advance).\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nThe same restrictions will also apply to visitors who explore the nearby Church of the Assumption of Our Lady and Saint John the Baptist, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nIt's not exactly clear when the new restrictions will come into place but it's likely to be imminently.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe ossuary, which dates back to the 14th century, is currently undergoing major renovations but it remains open to tourists.\n\nIt's estimated that nearly half a million visitors pass through the landmark and cathedral every year.", "description": "The Church of Bones has over 60,000 skulls and skeletons but some visitors move them to take selfies", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20714284.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arranged-Human-Bones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
