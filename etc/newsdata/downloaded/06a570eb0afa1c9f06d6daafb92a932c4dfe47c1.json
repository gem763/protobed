This could potentially eclipse the cladding issue. But because it's hidden and slow to manifest, it's not getting a lot of attention.\"\n\nMr Marosszeky said one of the magnesite-related jobs BCRC was working on in Sydney involved a 64-apartment building where all units were affected.\n\nSigns of magnesite damage include cracked tiles and floors that bulge over rusting steel bars.\n\n\"The owners will have to spend up to $2 million to fix this problem,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They're spending millions of dollars rectifying a problem caused by a defective building material that is no longer in the market for the last 30-odd years.\"\n\nUnlike the cladding issue, which prompted government and insurance industry intervention because it involves newer buildings, owners of older apartments with legacy problems will have to shoulder the cost.\n\n\"You could argue that magnesite is similar to the faulty materials like flammable cladding, but because it's not a new building, it's been built at a lower standard in the old days, there's no current pressure for the government,\" Mr Johnsson said.\n\nA costly legacy issue\n\n\"In those days, apartments were built quickly and builders didn't take time to make the floors perfectly flat with the concrete.\n\n\"The magnesite used to make the floors nice and flat was filled with sawdust and cork held together by a glue. Now the glue was the problem because it was made of magnesium oxychloride.\"\n\nMagnesite absorbs water and dissolves the chloride in the topping. When the chloride leeches to the steel bars reinforcing the floor, it corrodes them. Mr Marosszeky said the corrosion causes the concrete to expand by as much as eight times the volume of the original steel.\n\n\"These expansive forces rupture the concrete, lifting the concrete just as a tree root lifts a footpath as the roots expand,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMagnesite damage could show up as hollow sound on tiles, cracking of tiles and bulging of the carpet over the rusting steel bars.\n\nBecause of the slow corrosion, the symptoms aren't visible until the damage is already widespread.\n\n\"Usually, when it's discovered, the affected area that you can see is nowhere near the extent, because it's a massive hidden problem in the concrete,\" Mr Johnsson said.\n\n\"So you'll be looking at least two to three times the amount that is visible on the surface that will require repair. So when you see lumps on the floor, or corrosion rust stains on the concrete, the problem is already there.\"\n\nBecause it is a structural issue, ignoring it is not an option.\n\n\"If you leave it for too long the bars simply get eaten away and then structural strengthening has to be undertaken, adding very significantly to the remedial cost,\" Mr Marosszeky said.\n\n\"If you let it go, it can cost more than $1000 per square metre to remediate the problem, so stay alert and get help as soon as you detect any issues.\n\n\"In the worst cases, the building will collapse. You have to fix it because it's a structural problem.\"", "description": "A potentially corrosive product used in flooring until some 30 years ago may affect thousands of apartments - and fixing the problem is neither easy nor cheap.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.591%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_115%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b5f3f95574569517a5f3c51af2d3f08d891ced35", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
