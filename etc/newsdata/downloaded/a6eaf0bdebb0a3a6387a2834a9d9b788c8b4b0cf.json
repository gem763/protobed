He then walked back to his car all while not saying a word to his Auntie or Mom when he exited or re-entered,\" Holt wrote in a Facebook post for the department that's since gone viral.\n\nHolt said he then followed the teen back to his car and approached the driver, the boy\u2019s mother, to tell her of what he had just seen her son do for the elderly woman.\n\nIndependence Police Department\n\n\"His mom had no idea what was happening, because she thought she had done something wrong since I was in uniform,\" Holt said, describing the interaction. \"I told his mom that she has done amazing with him and I hope and pray he goes places. She started tearing up, because I was a cop and took time out of my day to call him out on what I witnessed.\"\n\nThe officer was so touched by this encounter that he is hoping to get back in touch with the teenager so he can take him out to dinner to thank him for his kindness.\n\n\"With all the hate fueled by color, belief, sexual preference or race ... the only thing this kid cared about was being kind,\" Holt said\n\nHolt said he knows the chances are slim that he will find the teen again but is counting on the power of social media.\n\nAdded Holt: \"Kiddo If you see me on the street again this guy owes ya a dinner. You ever need anything I will come running to ya.\"", "description": "Police in Missouri are searching for a teenage boy who was seen performing an incredible act of kindness.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/teen_jacket_rain_local_cop_190901_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
