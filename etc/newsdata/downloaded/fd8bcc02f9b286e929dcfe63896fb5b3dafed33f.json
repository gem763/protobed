Nine sectors including electronics, autos, pharmaceuticals and telecoms will be targeted.\n\nThe move to scrap the tax on open cell panels is a step in the right direction, said Vikas Agarwal, the India head of OnePlus, a Chinese firm known for high-end Android smartphones.\n\n\u201cTV is the next big focus for us. Any incentives or benefits are good for us,\u201d said Agarwal, whose firm is seen making a foray into television sales in the country.", "description": "India has scrapped a tax on imports of open cell TV panels, used to make television displays, in a move likely to boost television manufacturing in the country and counter incentives offered by nations such as Vietnam.", "authors": ["Sankalp Phartiyal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
