Two other images and a video of him in blackface later surfaced.\n\nThe images prompted international ridicule and were at odds with his claims he wants to improve the lives of minorities in Canada.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a body blow,\u201d pollster Frank Graves of EKOS Research said of the blackface images. \u201cWill the Liberals be able to recover? Who knows? There\u2019s no way of putting lipstick on a pig and making this go away.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
