GETTY\n\nStockholm \u2014 Polish novelist Olga Tokarczuk and Austrian writer Peter Handke won the 2018 and 2019 Nobel Prizes for literature on Thursday. The double prizes came after a year's hiatus due to sex abuse allegations that rocked the secretive Swedish Academy, which selects the laureates.\n\nTokarczuk won for works that explore the \"crossing of boundaries as a form of life,\" the academy said Thursday.\n\nHandke's work was described as exploring \"the periphery and the specificity of human experience\" with linguistic ingenuity.\n\nTokarczuk is only the 15th woman to win the Nobel literature prize in more than a century. Of the 11 Nobels awarded so far this week, all the other laureates have been men.\n\nThis combination of pictures shows Polish author Olga Tokarczuk (L) on September 17, 2018 in Krakow and Austrian novelist and playwright Peter Handke on November 22, 2012 in Salzburg, Austria. Getty\n\nThe literature prize was canceled last year after an exodus at the exclusive Swedish Academy, which chooses the winners, following sex abuse allegations. Jean-Claude Arnault, the husband of a former academy member, was convicted last year of two rapes in 2011. Arnault allegedly also leaked the name of Nobel Prize literature winners seven times.\n\nThe Nobel Foundation had warned that another group could be picked to award the prize if the academy didn't improve its tarnished image, but said in March it was satisfied the Swedish Academy had revamped itself and restored trust.\n\nThe 2018 and 2019 awards were chosen by the Swedish Academy's Nobel Committee, a new body made up of four academy members and five \"external specialists.\"\n\nNobel organizers say the committee suggests two names which then must be approved by the Swedish Academy. It's unclear whether the academy members simply rubber-stamped the experts' choice.\n\nIn his will, Swedish industrialist and dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel specifically designated the Swedish Academy as the institution responsible for the Nobel Prize in literature.\n\nNobel decided the physics, chemistry and medicine should be awarded in Stockholm, and the peace prize in Oslo. His exact reasons for having an institution in Norway hand out the peace prize is unclear, but during his lifetime Sweden and Norway were joined in a union, which was dissolved in 1905.\n\nThe coveted Nobel Peace Prize set to be awarded on Friday and the economics award on Monday.\n\nWednesday's chemistry prize went to John B. Goodenough, a German-born engineering professor at the University of Texas; M. Stanley Whittingham, a British-American chemistry professor at the State University of New York at Binghamton; and Japan's Akira Yoshino, of Asahi Kasei Corporation and Meijo University.\n\nOn Tuesday, Canadian-born James Peebles, 84, an emeritus professor at Princeton University, won the physics prize for his theoretical discoveries in cosmology together with Swiss scientists Michel Mayor, 77, and Didier Queloz, 53, both of the University of Geneva. The latter were honored for finding an exoplanet \u2014 a planet outside our solar system - that orbits a solar-type star.\n\nNobel Prize in medicine honors pioneering research that helps fight disease\n\nA day earlier, two Americans and one British scientist \u2014 Drs. William G. Kaelin Jr. of Harvard Medical School and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Gregg L. Semenza of Johns Hopkins University and Peter J. Ratcliffe of Britain's Francis Crick Institute and Oxford University \u2014 won the prize for advances in physiology or medicine. They were cited for their discoveries of \"how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.\"\n\nWith the glory comes a 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award, a gold medal and a diploma. The laureates receive them at an elegant ceremony on Dec. 10 - the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896 - in Stockholm and in Oslo.", "description": "Polish novelist Olga Tokarczuk and Austrian writer Peter Handke win 2018 and 2019 Prizes as Swedish Academy recovers after sex abuse allegations", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/10/4253f675-e72e-4e44-bed4-9616b11b0950/thumbnail/1200x630/960a7efe9f8fe2774d4c4269f12d4956/nobel-literature-1174963125.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
