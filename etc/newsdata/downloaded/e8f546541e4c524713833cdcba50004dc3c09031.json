Only British Gas would be larger.\n\nAny interested party can comment on the proposed transaction until 6 November, the CMA said on Thursday.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

It has sought to present itself as environmentally friendly and has invested in developing home battery technology to allow consumers to store energy generated from renewable sources.\n\nThe acquisition of SSE\u2019s retail gas and electricity unit would follow another purchase by Ovo: last year it took over Spark Energy after the challenger supplier collapsed. That deal gave Ovo 290,000 new customers.\n\nCompetition in the retail energy market has soared over the past decade, reaching a peak of 70 suppliers in mid-2018, up from only 12 at the end of 2009.\n\nHowever, a record number of companies went bust last year and more have failed this year. According to the latest figures from energy regulator Ofgem, by March the total number of gas and electricity suppliers declined to 60.\n\nThe latest casualty is Toto Energy, which ceased trading on Wednesday. Ofgem said it will choose a new supplier to take on all of Toto\u2019s 134,000 domestic customers. Until then, their energy supply will continue.\n\nDespite the greater competition \u2013 as well as the price cap for customers on prepayment meters introduced in April 2017 \u2013 more than one in 10 English households remain in fuel poverty, according to the latest government data, covering 2017.", "description": "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched an investigation into the planned sale of SSE\u2019s retail energy business to Ovo, to ensure the deal will not reduce competition.", "authors": ["Olesya Dmitracova"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/24/12/power-electricity.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
