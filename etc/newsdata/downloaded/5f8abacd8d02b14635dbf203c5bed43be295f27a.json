Ryan, the school\u2019s president, said the gift is important for U-Va. because one of the institution\u2019s priorities is increasing access and support for students whose parents did not attend college. The gift, one of the largest ever given to the school, will do just that, he said. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled by it,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s a gift that will resonate beyond U-Va. because it is so central to the mission of higher education to ensure that college is a place of social mobility. Amid increasing public skepticism about the value of higher education and criticism that many institutions are elitist, Ryan said, \u201cit\u2019s incredibly important that we do all we can to make sure that talented students from every walk of life have a real shot of attending.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe gift is personal for Ryan, just as it is for Walentas. Ryan was a first-generation college student as well, at Yale University and the University of Virginia School of Law. \u201cIt opened doors for me that I didn\u2019t even know existed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt completely changed the trajectory of my life.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nThe bulk of Walentas\u2019s $100 million gift will go toward scholarships, with $50 million funding first-generation students through the Jefferson Scholars Foundation.\n\nThe university will give an additional $20 million for full scholarships for first-generation undergraduates from its Bicentennial Scholars Fund; U-Va. is marking the 200th year since it was chartered.\n\nAD\n\nU-Va.\u2019s Darden School of Business will benefit from $25 million from Walentas\u2019s gift to create a fellowship program for students who were the first in their families to graduate from college and want to continue their education in business.\n\nAD\n\nThe remaining $25 million will be used to attract top faculty and students.\n\nThe university hopes to lure students who excel in leadership, scholarship and citizenship, said Jimmy Wright, president of the Jefferson Scholars Foundation.\n\n\u201cIt is our expectation and intent that we will establish the best first-generation scholarship in the country as the result of David\u2019s philanthropy,\u201d Wright said. \u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable gift.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe state flagship school has already been drawing increasing numbers of first-generation students. In 2012, there were 318 first-year students who were first in their families to attend college. In 2019, that number had jumped to 502 of the 3,920 first-year students.\n\nThe gift is expected to fund 15 first-generation Walentas Scholars each year, with the first class to enter in fall 2022. They\u2019ll begin their search in three places important to Walentas \u2014 New York City, Virginia and Rochester, N.Y. \u2014 but won\u2019t limit it to those locations.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to overstate the impact the scholarships can have, according to Kadeem Cooper, who was nominated by his Brooklyn high school and selected as a Jefferson Scholar, an award that he said made him turn down his offer of admission from Harvard University. \u201cThat was an inflection point,\u201d he said as his 10th reunion at U-Va. approaches. \u201cIn ways that are tangible and intangible, it kind of changed the trajectory of my life.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe opportunity for a college education without debt was too good to pass up. It opened all sorts of possibilities for Cooper after college. He could (and did) choose law school, and a job on Capitol Hill working on issues that are important to him, rather than feeling compelled to make decisions driven by student loans.\n\nGrowing up in Brooklyn raised by his mother, an immigrant from Jamaica, Cooper knew education could be a pathway to social mobility. \u201cOne of the reasons for the wealth gap between African Americans and white Americans is . . . white families often have social capital that students of color don\u2019t have,\u201d he said. \u201cJefferson Scholars gave me access to social capital,\u201d as he became part of a network of high-achieving students and alumni who could mentor him and offer advice.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEducation is not just supposed to be about individual enrichment,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be about preparing responsible citizens. Our democracy doesn\u2019t work if we don\u2019t have people committed to the community.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n* * *\n\nWalentas grew up working hard and grabbing chances when he saw them. Working on the farm as a child made him self-reliant, he said. After his father\u2019s death, when he was a young teenager, he and his brother moved back home to Rochester. He did well in school, when he wasn\u2019t getting into trouble. One day, when he was waiting in the principal\u2019s office, he saw a poster for a four-year ROTC scholarship and said, \u201cThat\u2019s for me.\u201d\n\nAnother day in high school, he was reading the paper when he saw an ad from a car dealership promising a car for 99 cents for the first person in line that Monday, $9.99 for the second.\n\nAD\n\nIt was Friday morning. He got on a bus and went straight there and waited, behind one other person, for three days. That Monday morning, he bought a 1947 Plymouth for less than a $10 bill.\n\nAD\n\nHe drove it to U-Va. \u2014 and to the nearby women\u2019s colleges in Virginia. That eventually got him kicked out of school, and cost him his ROTC scholarship, for violating the school\u2019s rules banning overnight stays.\n\nThat later turned out to be a good thing, Walentas said, because he went home and worked for a year and re-enrolled with the money he had saved.\n\n\u201cU-Va. completely changed my life,\u201d he said. Suddenly, he was surrounded by smart people, leaders, people aspiring to all sorts of professions. \u201cIt was a whole different world.\u201d\n\nWalentas received his undergraduate degree in 1961 and his MBA from the Darden School of Business in 1964. After that, he began his next adventures \u2014 moving to Greenland to clean out septic systems because it paid more than anything he could find in the United States to pay off his student loans, talking his way onto a Danish freighter to get back to the United States, selling a pint of blood when he was out of money to get lunch and enough gas to get home. Then he was working and dreaming of real estate, finding a partner to take out a loan to buy an apartment building in New York. He was off and running.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis best-known gamble was about 40 years ago, when he and some partners spent $12 million to buy 2 million square feet of space in a largely abandoned industrial area of Brooklyn \u201cDown under the Manhattan Bridge overpass,\u201d which has been transformed into the gleaming, vibrant (and expensive) waterfront neighborhood known as Dumbo.\n\nSince he founded the real estate development firm Two Trees Management in 1968, the company has owned, managed and developed a portfolio worth more than $4 billion. The company is now led by his son, Jed Walentas.\n\nNow, at 81, he and his wife, Jane Walentas \u2014 \u201cShe\u2019s the best. She\u2019s more responsible for my success than anybody,\u201d he said \u2014 are focused on philanthropy. They have given to many causes and have supported the Jefferson Scholars for decades.\n\nIt felt like time to make a donation that could alter the course.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy time at U-Va. completely changed my life,\u201d David Walentas said. \u201cI wish all the recipients good luck, and have a go, and have the courage to follow your dreams.\u201d", "description": "The donation comes from a graduate who said his education was \u201ctransformational.\u201d", "authors": ["Susan Svrluga", "Reporter Covering Higher Education For The Grade Point Blog"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/z4SAeBQ1rEBqbx6w22KHC-C5ky4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KMM6CTXMO4I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
