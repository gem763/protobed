It would also give police five months to subdue the pro-democracy movement that erupted in the city in June in response to a proposed law to allow China to extradite people present in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Chinese regime denied the report, calling it a false \u201crumor.\u201d\n\nReporters caught Lam in a secret recording of a private meeting this summer lamenting that, if she had a choice, she would step down from the chief executive position, but her current powers were \u201climited.\u201d Lam later denied she meant the Communist Party was forcing her to stay, instead claiming she meant the easy thing for her to do would be to step down but her conscience would not allow it.\n\nThe Financial Times report claimed Communist Party officials had put the proposal to remove Lam on Xi\u2019s table, but it had not yet been approved. The deal would reportedly replace Lam with an \u201cinterim\u201d chief executive for the rest of her term, which would end in 2022.\n\nThe newspaper listed several potential successors, all with close ties to Beijing:\n\nLeading candidates to succeed Ms Lam include Norman Chan, former head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and Henry Tang, son of a textile magnate who has also served as the territory\u2019s financial secretary and chief secretary for administration, the people added. [\u2026] Mr Chan is one of the \u201cthree Chans\u201d viewed as possible successors to Ms Lam. But the other two \u2014 Paul Chan, financial secretary, and Bernard Chan, convener of an \u201cexecutive council\u201d that advises Ms Lam \u2014 are viewed as being too close to her now discredited administration.\n\nLam\u2019s office did not comment on the story, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry denied it. According to the Global Times, a government propaganda newspaper, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying \u201csaid that the central government will firmly support Lam and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government in governing according to the law, stopping the violence and chaos as soon as possible and restoring order.\u201d Hua reportedly dismissed the Financial Times report as \u201cpolitical rumors with ulterior motives.\u201d\n\nThe foreign ministry notably omitted any discussion of Carrie Lam from the transcript of its regular press briefing Wednesday, where the Global Times said Hua made those remarks.\n\nThe Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute found in a poll published this month that Lam is the least popular chief executive in the history of the city. Only 15 percent of those polled said they would vote for Lam if Hong Kong had the right to elect its leaders; currently, the Communist Party appoints the chief executive and a secretive special interest lobby chooses half the city\u2019s lawmakers. Voters only choose half of their lawmakers by vote and the government screens candidates for unfavorable positions towards China.\n\nLam had an approval rating of 22.3 percent, the lowest on record since the United Kingdom gave Hong Kong to the Communist Party in 1997.\n\nJournalists have repeatedly questioned Lam for staying in power amid the worst unrest the city has seen under China, triggered by her government promoting the extradition bill \u2013 which would allow China to imprison Hong Kong residents and visitors for violations of communist law. During a fiery press conference in August, Lam had to field questions such as \u201cDo you have a conscience?\u201d and \u201cWhen will you die?\u201d\n\nThe protests that began in June initially demanded only the withdrawal of the extradition bill. Today, the protesters have added four demands to that list: freedom for political prisoners locked up for opposing the bill, direct election of lawmakers, an end to the government referring to peaceful protests as \u201criots,\u201d and an independent investigation into police brutality.\n\nThe protesters are not demanding Lam resign \u2013 specifically because they know China will replace her with another pro-communist leader \u2013 so many have questioned what removing Lam would do to please protesters.\n\n\u201cThe plan definitely has come too late as Carrie Lam\u2019s net support\u2026 dropped to a disastrous level as early as four months ago,\u201d political analyst Dixon Sing told the Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cIt is impossible to believe that Hong Kong people\u2026 would be happy and go back home once Carrie Lam has stepped down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a change in chief executive will have much impact on the profound political crisis that Hong Kong is facing,\u201d Ben Bland, director of the Southeast Asia Project at the Lowy Institute, told the Asian outlet Coconuts, which covers Hong Kong. \u201cThe problem is less who leads Hong Kong and more that its leaders have no popular legitimacy because they are effectively chosen by Beijing.\u201d\n\nThe Hong Kong government formally withdrew the extradition bill on Wednesday, which Lam had promised protesters they would do.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "China is preparing a plan to remove Carrie Lam, the least popular chief executive in Hong Kong history, a report claimed.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/wi/afp/19/fa8b4c_hong-kong-chief-executive-carrie-lam-reported-174-complaints-police-protests-e1566337095251-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
