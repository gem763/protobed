Wealth taxes. Wall Street taxes. Inequality taxes. And probably more to come. So lots of creative thinking about wealth redistribution. Wealth creation? Not so much. \u2026one way to look at boosting GDP growth is thinking about specific policies to boost labor force and productivity growth. But there\u2019s another way of approaching the issue: How many fast-growing growing new firms would need to be generated each year to lift the economy-wide growth rate each year by one percent? \u2026a rough calculation by analyst Robert Litan figures there about 15 billion-dollar (in sales) companies formed every year. But what if the American entrepreneurial ecosystem were so vibrant that it produced 60 such companies annually? \u2026The big point here is that the American private sector is key to growth. No other large economy is as proficient as the US in creating high-impact startups. But it doesn\u2019t appear that the Democratic enthusiasm for big and bold tax plans is matched by concern about unwanted trade-offs.\n\nIf you want a substantive economic critique of class-warfare tax policy, Alan Reynolds has a must-read article on the topic.\n\nHe starts by explaining why it\u2019s important to measure how sensitive taxpayers are (the \u201celasticity of taxable income\u201d) to changes in tax rates.\n\nElasticity of taxable income estimates are simply a relatively new summary statistic used to illustrate observed behavioral responses to past variations in marginal tax rates. They do so by examining what happened to the amount of income reported on individual tax returns, in total and at different levels of income, before and after major tax changes. \u2026For example, if a reduced marginal tax rate produces a substantial increase in the amount of taxable income reported to the IRS, the elasticity of taxable income is high. If not, the elasticity is low. ETI incorporates effects of tax avoidance as well as effects on incentives for productive activity such as work effort, research, new business start-ups, and investment in physical and human capital.\n\nAlan then looks at some of the ETI estimates and what they imply for tax rates, though he notes that the revenue-maximizing rate is not the optimal rate.\n\nDiamond and Saez claim that, if the relevant ETI is 0.25, then the revenue-maximizing top tax rate is 73 percent. Such estimates, however, do not refer to the top federal income tax rate, \u2026but to the combined marginal rate on income, payrolls, and sales at the federal, state, and local level. \u2026with empirically credible changes in parameters, the Diamond-Saez formula can more easily be used to show that top U.S. federal, state, and local tax rates are already too high rather than too low. By also incorporating dynamic effects \u2014 such as incentives to invest in human capital and new ideas \u2014 more recent models estimate that the long-term revenue-maximizing top tax rate is between 22 and 49 percent\u2026 Elasticity of taxable, or perhaps gross income\u2026can be \u201ca sufficient statistic to approximate the deadweight loss\u201d from tax disincentives and distortions. Although recent studies define revenue-maximization as \u201coptimal,\u201d Goolsbee\u2026rightly emphasizes, \u201cThe fact that efficiency costs rise with the square of the tax rate are likely to make the optimal rate well below the revenue-maximizing rate.\u201d\n\nThese excerpts only scratch the surface.\n\nAlan\u2019s article extensively discusses how high-income taxpayers are especially sensitive to high tax rates, in part because they have considerable control over the timing, level, and composition of their income.\n\nHe also reviews the empirical evidence from major shifts in tax rates last century.\n\nAll told, his article is a devastating take-down of the left-of-center economists who have tried to justify extortionary tax rates. Simply stated, high tax rates hinder the economy, create deadweight loss, and don\u2019t produce revenue windfalls.\n\nThat being said, I wonder whether his article will have any impact. As Kevin Williamson points out is a column for National Review, the left isn\u2019t primarily motivated by a desire for more tax money.\n\nPerhaps the strangest utterance of Barack Obama\u2019s career in public office\u2026was his 2008 claim that raising taxes on the wealthy is a moral imperative, even if the tax increase in question ended up reducing overall federal revenue. Which is to say, Obama argued that it did not matter whether a tax increase hurt the Treasury, so long as it also hurt, at least in theory and on paper, certain wealthy people. \u2026ideally, you want a tax system with low transaction costs (meaning a low cost of compliance) and one that doesn\u2019t distort a lot of economic activity. You want to get enough money to fund your government programs with as little disruption to life as possible. \u2026Punitive taxes aren\u2019t about the taxes \u2014 they\u2019re about the punishment. That taxation should have been converted from a technical question into a moral crusade speaks to the basic failure of the progressive enterprise in the United States\u2026the progressive demand for a Scandinavian welfare state at no cost to anybody they care about\u2026ends up being a very difficult equation to balance, probably an impossible one. And when the numbers don\u2019t work, there\u2019s always cheap moralistic histrionics.\n\nSo what leads our friends on the left to pursue such misguided policies? What drives their support for punitive taxation?\n\nIs it that they\u2019re overflowing with compassion and concern for the poor?\n\nHardly.\n\nWriting for the Federalist, Emily Ekins shares some in-depth polling data that discovers that envy is the real motive.\n\nSupporters often contend their motivation is compassion for the dispossessed\u2026 In a new study, I examine\u2026competing explanations and ask whether envy and resentment of the successful or compassion for the needy better explain support for socialism, raising taxes on the rich, redistribution, and the like. \u2026Statistical tests reveal resentment of the successful has about twice the effect of compassion in predicting support for increasing top marginal tax rates, wealth redistribution, hostility to capitalism, and believing billionaires should not exist. \u2026people who agree that \u201cvery successful people sometimes need to be brought down a peg or two even if they\u2019ve done nothing wrong\u201d were more likely to want to raise taxes on the rich than people who agree that \u201cI suffer from others\u2019 sorrows.\u201d \u2026I ran another series of statistical tests to investigate the motivations behind the following beliefs: 1) It\u2019s immoral for our system to allow the creation of billionaires, 2) billionaires threaten democracy, and 3) the distribution of wealth in the United States is \u201cunjust.\u201d Again, the statistical tests find that resentment against successful people is more influential than compassion in predicting each of these three beliefs. In fact, not only is resentment more impactful, but compassionate people are significantly less likely to agree that it\u2019s immoral for our system to allow people to become billionaires.\n\nHere\u2019s one of her charts, showing that resentment is far and away the biggest driver of support for class-warfare proposals.\n\nThese numbers are quite depressing.\n\nThey suggest that no amount of factual analysis or hard data will have any effect of the debate.\n\nAnd there is polling data to back up Emily\u2019s statistical analysis. Heck, some folks on the left openly assert that envy should be the basis for tax policy.\n\nIn other words, Deroy Murdock and Margaret Thatcher weren\u2019t creating imaginary enemies.\n\nP.S.
