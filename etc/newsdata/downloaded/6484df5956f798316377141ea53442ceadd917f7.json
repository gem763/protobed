Members in the Iowa chapters have been clear from the get-go about their 2020 plans: \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about Bernie,\u201d Caroline Schoonover, a co-chair of the Central Iowa group, told me back in April. \u201cHe\u2019s not a factor in our organizing at all.\u201d Individual members would be welcome to volunteer for Sanders on their own time, she said, but campaigning for him as a chapter would distract from their local efforts, which include advocating for tenants\u2019 rights and raising the alarm about so-called crisis pregnancy centers.\n\nBack in March, the DSA\u2019s National Political Committee leadership team voted to endorse Sanders, after a controversial vote in which only about a quarter of DSA\u2019s membership weighed in. The committee then established an independent campaign for Sanders called DSA for Bernie, which operates separately from the official Sanders campaign and which individual chapters can join.\n\nBut as the February 3 caucuses creep closer, Iowa DSA members will be focused on local efforts, including organizing local tenants\u2019 unions. Three Iowa DSA leaders told me that while members are allowed to volunteer for Sanders on their own time, the chapter won\u2019t formally campaign for him. \u201cIowa DSA chapters don\u2019t have as many resources compared to other larger cities,\u201d said Alex Loehrer, 32, who co-chairs the DSA chapter in Iowa City. \u201cAs much as many of our members love Bernie, we see our importance more so in building class consciousness and working-class power in our communities, because that will ultimately last longer.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s \u201ca lot bigger than a few back-and-forths on Twitter,\u201d Javier Miranda, the 25-year-old leader of the DSA chapter in Ames, Iowa, told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a fear that if we engage in too much electoral organizing we are losing our capacity to imagine outside the system that we are currently living in,\u201d he said. People criticizing Iowa\u2019s DSA chapters tend to live in larger cities with active labor movements, Miranda told me. \u201cIn Ames, Iowa, that is not the case,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes more sense for us to focus on building that movement, to make that longer-lasting change.\u201d\n\nAnother part of the Iowa members\u2019 aversion to formally participating in electoral politics is their disdain for their state\u2019s biggest claim to fame: the caucuses, which every four years help determine the rest of the presidential race. \u201cThe caucus is not an accessible process,\u201d Joe Ellerbroek, who co-chairs the Des Moines DSA alongside Schoonover, told me. The state Democratic Party has been fielding complaints to this effect for years from Iowans with inflexible work or personal schedules. (This cycle, the caucuses will take place on a Monday.) It\u2019s both an undemocratic and a \u201cdeliberately confusing\u201d process,\u201d Ellerbroek said\u2014a process neither he nor members of his chapter want to prop up with their time or funds. He and other Iowa DSA leaders want their groups to provide a consistent force for socialist change in the state long after Sanders campaign staffers have packed up and left.", "description": "Democratic socialists across the country disagree on their 2020 strategy.", "authors": ["Elaine Godfrey"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19163690634345/facebook.jpg?1568386229", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
