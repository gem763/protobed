He previously played eight times for the Kangaroos -- Australia's rugby league team -- but is eligible to play for Tonga through his parents.\n\nThe former fullback is seeking to claim AUS$10 million ($7 million) in damages in an ongoing legal battle against Rugby Australia. He lost sponsorship deals with car manufacturer Land Rover and sportswear brand Asics in the fallout of his dismissal by the governing body.\n\nFolau's brother John, a teammate of the former Wallaby at the NSW Warratahs, has also signed to play rugby league for Tonga after being granted permission to leave the Super Rugby side.\n\n\"This is great news,\" Tonga's head coach Frank Endacott was reported as saying . \"These guys are great footballers and bring size, pace and skill to the team.\n\n\"They will make a huge impact in the team and provide exciting attack options all over the park.\n\n\"This will be great boost to the internationals, and I can't wait to see the crowd support that this will generate from our famous Mate Ma'a Tonga supporters. It is good to see the RLIF approving these players for internationals. This is great for the game.\"", "description": "Disgraced former Australia rugby union star Israel Folau has signed to play rugby league for Tonga, according to reports.", "authors": ["George Ramsay"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190513111719-israel-folau-australia-england-try-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
