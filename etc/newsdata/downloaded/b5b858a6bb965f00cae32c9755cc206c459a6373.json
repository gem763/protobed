(Carlos Osorio/Associated Press)\n\nThe formerly vacant property was supposed to be a Christmas gift for a family in need. Now it\u2019s gone \u2014 razed \u2014 and people want to know who did it.\n\nState Rep. Sherry Gay-Dagnogo (D) of Michigan had paid $1,000 to buy the house on Detroit\u2019s west side from the Detroit Land Bank Authority, which seeks to fix up blighted properties. Her nonprofit organization then spent $42,000 on the rehabilitation of the house, according to WDIV, which first reported the demolition.\n\nLast week, Gay-Dagnogo got a call from a neighbor, who had left her home for a few hours and returned to an unexpected sight: The Gay-Dagnogo house was gone. A pile of dirt and a red mesh fence marked the spot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a mystery. The house disappeared,\u201d Gay-Dagnogo told the Detroit News. \u201cIt\u2019s like they dug around [the house] with a spatula and lifted the basement out. There\u2019s nothing there.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post was unable to reach Gay-Dagnogo for comment on Monday.\n\n[Detroit has thousands of vacant lots. Here\u2019s why some are becoming honeybee farms.]\n\nTyrone Clifton, director of the Detroit Building Authority, told The Post that the city did not order, direct or fund the demolition of Gay-Dagnogo\u2019s house. A demolition tracker map run by the city also does not show a demolition slated for the property.\n\n\u201cThere also was no permit pulled by any private party for demolition at this address,\u201d Clifton said in a statement. \u201cThis is now being handled by the Detroit Police Department as a criminal investigation.\u201d\n\nThe mysterious demolition comes as Detroit seeks to tear down 40,000 vacant structures across the city in an effort to improve neighborhoods. At least 13 of the federally funded program\u2019s contractors have been suspended since June 2016 for reasons including mishandling asbestos and demolishing the wrong house, the Detroit Free Press reported. Gay-Dagnogo, who represents northwest Detroit, has criticized the program.\n\nGay-Dagnogo\u2019s nonprofit organization, the Coalition to Integrate Technology and Education, had bought multiple properties near city parks with the intention of revitalizing them, the News reported. The now-demolished home on Minock Street had sat next to a vacant city-owned structure that caught fire in June and was torn down by demolition company Adamo Group in July, Gay-Dagnogo told the News.\n\nAn attorney for the company, Christian Hauser, told the Free Press that Adamo had \u201cabsolutely nothing to do with\u201d the demolition of Gay-Dagnogo\u2019s house. John Roach, a Detroit spokesman, told The Post that Adamo had given the city photos from July 30 that showed the cleared house next door and the untouched house belonging to Gay-Dagnogo. He declined to say whether Adamo had been cleared in the police investigation.\n\n[A Detroit diabetic was deported to Iraq, where he\u2019d never lived. He died from lack of insulin, family says.]\n\nGay-Dagnogo\u2019s house was damaged by the fire next door, so she boarded up the structure and was seeking permits to keep renovating it, WDIV reported. She told the Free Press that the city recently had sent her a letter saying she had until Oct. 14 to rehabilitate the property or demolish it.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be torn down,\u201d Gay-Dagnogo told the Free Press. \u201cMy house was still standing; my house was boarded. We were waiting to get an assessment of what it would cost to restore it.\u201d\n\nDetroit\u2019s demolition program, meant to help the city recover from its 2013 bankruptcy, was the subject of a criminal investigation that in April led to charges against two former Adamo employees. They were accused of accepting bribes and rigging demolition bids. Both were sentenced to a year in prison after pleading guilty to fraud-related charges. Adamo also faced a 90-day suspension last year when it tore down the wrong home.\n\nFederal officials also tightened their oversight of the demolition program in June after Reps. Brenda Lawrence and Rashida Tlaib, both Michigan Democrats, asked for additional regulations related to potentially contaminated soil, asbestos exposure and illegal dumping.\n\nAs for Gay-Dagnogo, she told the Free Press she was relieved that the surprise demolition had not involved an ordinary citizen homeowner, who might have lacked a way to call attention to the issue.\n\n\u201cWhat if this happened to a citizen who doesn\u2019t have the reach to have these conversations?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat kind of hoops would they be put through to try and bring some resolution to them losing their home?\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nFlorida official interrupts ceremony to confront deputy who once arrested him\n\nA teen\u2019s intimate messages to another boy were leaked by classmates.
