He added, \u201cI\u2019m the one that did the capturing. I\u2019m the one that knows more about it than you people\u2026. As you know, most of the ISIS fighters that we captured \u2013 \u2018we.\u2019 We. Not Obama. We. We captured them. Me.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, seeing a grown man grovel for credit like this made for a pitiful display, but that was not the only problem with Trump\u2019s pitch.\n\nTo the extent that reality still has any meaning, Trump\u2019s policy against ISIS largely mirrors Obama\u2019s policy against ISIS. The Daily Beast reported a couple of years ago that White House officials made a deliberate effort to help \u201cbrand\u201d the Trump campaign against ISIS as different from its predecessor, although there are no significant differences between Trump\u2019s strategy and Obama\u2019s.\n\nComplicating matters, as the New York Times reports today, Trump\u2019s new policy in northern Syria has effectively ended the offensive against ISIS, to the militants\u2019 delight.\n\nNow, analysts say that Mr. Trump\u2019s pullout has handed the Islamic State its biggest win in more than four years and greatly improved its prospects. With American forces rushing for the exits, in fact, American officials said last week that they were already losing their ability to collect critical intelligence about the group\u2019s operations on the ground. \u201cThere is no question that ISIS is one of the big winners in what is happening in Syria,\u201d said Lina Khatib, director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House, a research center in London.\n\nThe Times\u2019 article added that when news spread of Trump\u2019s decision, there was \u201cjubilation\u201d among ISIS supporters, and the White House\u2019s policy \u201chas lifted the morale of fighters in affiliates as far away as Libya and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nTrump went to uncomfortable lengths yesterday to demand that everyone associate his administration\u2019s policy toward ISIS with him personally.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the president should be careful what he wishes for.", "description": "Trump has demanded that everyone associate his administration's policy toward ISIS with him personally.
