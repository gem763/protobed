The Barksdales used shoelaces to tie up the guards and placed them in the back of the van with an unidentified third inmate, Gonzales said.\n\nThe Barksdales then allegedly drove the van to northeast Arizona, where they abandoned it, with the guards still \"tied up in the van,\" according to the U.S. Marshals Service.\n\nU.S. Marshals\n\nThe guards needed time to get free from the van, which gave the Barksdales \"a six or seven hour head start,\" the service said in a statement.\n\nThe couple is wanted in connection to the murder of Frank Bligh, who vanished when his Arizona home burned down on April 16.\n\nThey allegedly fled to upstate New York in May, where U.S. Marshals and a SWAT team surrounded their RV and took them into custody. They are wanted on charges first-degree murder, first-degree burglary, arson of an occupied structure, theft of means of transportation, criminal damage and prohibited possession.\n\nFederal authorities are offering up to $20,000 for information leading to their arrests.\n\nABC News' Jack Date and Enjoli Francis contributed to this report.", "description": "The photos were taken at San Juan County Jail where Blane Barksdale, 56, and his wife Susan Barksdale, 59, were housed the night before they escaped.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/escape-1-ap-er-190901_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
