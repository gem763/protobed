Or, to use a term that Trump wouldn\u2019t like, the public might see it as prima facie evidence of \u201ccollusion\u201d between Trump and a foreign power that aims to influence the election \u2014 the sort of direct evidence that was lacking in the Mueller report.\n\nSecond, the White House line presumes that the public won\u2019t see the White House\u2019s record of the conversation as containing a quid pro quo. But there are plenty of readings by which it does. In the conversation, Trump directly invokes the idea of \u201creciprocity\u201d between the United States and Ukraine. He says \u201cwe do a lot for Ukraine \u2026. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time.\u201d Zelensky also discusses the purchase of Javelin missiles from the U.S. All of this comes before two fairly direct requests \u2014 Trump calls the first one a \u201cfavor\u201d \u2014 that Trump makes of Zelensky, one concerning a cybersecurity firm called CrowdStrike and the other concerning Biden.\n\nThird, it presumes that there won\u2019t be more evidence of a quid pro quo that emerges later on. Given how rapidly the story is developing, that doesn\u2019t seem like a safe bet, either.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nate Silver", "Fivethirtyeight.Com Features If-This-Is-Trumps-Best-Case-The-Ukraine-Scandal-Is-Looking-Really-Bad-For-Him"], "top_image": ""}
