Phillip/AP Photo analysis Biden fails to step up or fall down The frontrunner marches in place, waiting to see if any of his rivals can displace him.\n\nVice President Joe Biden\u2014who as in previous outings interspersed some strong moments with several mushy or head-scratching ones\u2014seemed emphatically life-sized, once again, in the latest debate in Houston.\n\nThere is an optical dimension to presidential politics that is hard to explain in logical terms but hard to deny in practical experience: At some point winning candidates seem to grow larger in public projection and their ability to dominate a stage.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSomeone starts the campaign as an ordinary politician, desperate for a few extra seconds on camera, and somehow becomes a leader who doesn\u2019t have to beg or contrive cute one-liners to get attention, by virtue of being very visibly the most consequential person in the field.\n\nOne conclusion of Thursday night\u2019s debate, over three hours: Those mysterious optics have not kicked in yet. It was a big stage of people who still seem smaller than the position they are seeking.\n\nBiden\u2019s previous uneven performances didn\u2019t dislodge him atop the race, and so caution is justified in predicting bleeding wounds from this one. Even so, discursive answers on substantive issues like deportation of undocumented immigrants and Afghanistan, an oddly dated reference to a \u201crecord player,\u201d disrespectful digs and patronizing swipes from rivals, all raise the question: Can he withstand four more months of this before actual Democratic voting begins?\n\nAnd, if not, a question for his rivals: When will those mysterious optics of power kick in for them?\n\nA smaller field\u2014ten candidates on one night instead of twenty over two\u2014meant that there was no one present who didn\u2019t pass at least some modest threshold of plausibility. And most of the candidates had at least some moments when their voices carried. But there was no one who clearly owned the stage and loomed obviously larger than rivals.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/25/a1/ce1dee70451ab229deac77900923/compilation.png\" true\n\nThere\u2019s time yet, of course. It was around this period four years ago when Trump changed in perception from a loud novelty candidate to someone who clearly was in command of the GOP race and made much more conventionally credentialed opponents look small on the stage.\n\nIt was strong performances at a debate and on the trail in October 2007 that helped Barack Obama overcome a somewhat slow start and establish himself as front-runner Hillary Clinton\u2019s equal in stature in the Democratic contest.\n\nIt does not seem likely that the Houston debate will live in memory as such a moment of transformation.\n\nFor one thing, it was at times pretty hard work for the audience: three hours is a lot, especially watching people who of necessity are being quite nakedly calculating in their effort to stand out. One good thing about the length, however, was a somewhat more dignified tone: candidates did not have to shout and filibuster and interrupt to snare the spotlight as much as they did at the summer\u2019s two previous sets of two-night debates.\n\nElizabeth Warren showed the traits that helped drive her surge earlier this year have survived intact to the fall. But her performances tend to flicker. Crisp and impassioned answers on expanding access to health care or curbing access to guns would be followed by long stretches when she seemed to blend into the background.", "description": "The frontrunner marches in place, waiting to see if any of his rivals can displace him.", "authors": ["John F.
