Japanese researchers have even tested miniature prototypes in space.\n\nExperts say a space elevator could be possible with current technology, especially if we were to build it on the moon . A lunar elevator would not have to contend with the Earth's gravitational force or space debris .\n\nThere are still many details to iron out, though, including how to build such a monumental structure.\n\nFor more stories go to www.businessinsider.co.za.\n\nA growing number of scientists and space-technology enthusiasts are looking into ways to construct a huge elevator, either on Earth or the moon, that could transport cargo to and from space.\n\n\n\nIn a study published in September, which has not been peer reviewed, two graduate students proposed a version of a space elevator that would stretch from the moon to Earth's satellite-level orbit. They said the structure could be built with current technology.\n\n\"They're right, and we were right first, that the lunar elevator is feasible technology,\" Michael Laine, president of space-elevator development company LiftPort Group, told Business Insider.\n\nOther advocates of space elevators have argued for years that building such a structure is feasible with current technology and could open up new frontiers of space exploration.\n\nHere's how a space elevator would work.\n\nIn 1895, Russian rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky gazed at the Eiffel Tower and imagined it stretching into space.\n\nHis daydream became the first pitch for a space elevator.\n\nHe imagined a tower like that could carry cargo to geostationary orbit - the height at which satellites can sync their orbit with Earth's rotation - 35,786 kilometers above sea level. As objects ascended the tower, they would gain horizontal velocity from the Earth's rotation and could use that speed to launch into orbit.\n\nRelative to rockets, space elevators would be a cheaper, faster way to get cargo and people off of Earth. That's because liftoff is one of the most expensive and difficult parts of space travel.\n\n\"The high cost of space transportation coupled with unreliability is a virtual padlock on the final frontier,\" reads a 2008 NASA fact sheet. \"Our dreams of everyday life in space and its promise for a better life on Earth are hostage to the high cost of space transportation.\"\n\nThat hasn't changed. On average, getting material from Earth's surface into space costs about $20,000 (R301,000) per kilogram, or roughly $10,000 (R150,000) per pound. Since NASA's space shuttle program ended in 2011, private companies have been launching supplies to the International Space Station.\n\n\"The space elevator would essentially be an economic game-changer for the space industry,\" Tyler Harris, an engineer at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, told Business Insider.\n\nBy some estimates, a well designed elevator would cut the cost of cargo transportation to as low as $100 (R1,500) per kilogram. Even at $1,000 (R15,000) per kilogram, that would be just 5% of the current cost.\n\nThe basic design of a space elevator would involve a cable, or \"tether,\" that could stretch from an anchor on the ground to a counterweight in space.\n\nA heavy car, or \"climber,\" would travel up and down the tether. The elevator would carry cargo to geostationary orbit, past the region where Earth's gravity is strongest.\n\nThe centrifugal force of the Earth's rotation would hold up the tether.\n\nThink of holding one end of a string with a stone attached to the other end, and whirling it around in a circle. Centrifugal force is what pushes the stone outwards and makes the string stretch out its full length. In a space elevator, the tether would be like that string, and the counterweight would be like the stone.\n\nExperts say this type of structure could be built with current technology. Cost estimates range considerably, from $1 billion (R15 billion) to nearly $90 billion (R1.3 trilliob).\n\nHarris recently conducted an assessment of three different space-elevator designs and found that they would all be \"environmentally sustainable and economically viable.\"\n\nThe $90 billion (R1.3 trillion) cost estimate comes from the Obayashi Corporation, which is based in Japan. The company wants to build a space elevator by 2050.\n\nThe China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, a subdivision of the nation's main space-program contractor, wants to build a space elevator by 2045, though company has not released any details about those plans.\n\nNASA has funded research on space elevators, too, but has never committed to building one.\n\nObayashi expects it to take 20 years to construct the cable from a 400-meter base that floats in water.\n\nThe company envisions the final product carrying 100-ton climbers off of Earth.\n\nThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched a miniature version of a space elevator in September 2018 to see how it reacted to the space environment.\n\nThe device, called Space Tethered Autonomous Robotic Satellite - Miniature Elevator (STARS-Me), was designed by researchers at Shizuoka University. It involved two CubeSat satellites, each of which could communicate with the ground, with a 14-meter (46-foot) tether between them.\n\nThe goal: crawl a Bluetooth-enabled climber up the tether from one CubeSat to the other.\n\nThe launch was successful, according to a February report, but the researchers had difficulty communicating with one of the CubeSats. They have yet to verify whether the climber successfully traveled up and down the tether.\n\nThe same Japanese research team is planning to launch a larger version of the device.\n\nThe next experiment involves a 2-kilometer tether and a robot that could clear away space debris. The researchers haven't announced any timeline yet, though.\n\nLiftPort, meanwhile has conducted space-elevator technology demonstrations on the ground. Climbers ascended cables as high as 1,000 feet.\n\nLaine started looking into space elevators as a member of the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC), which researched such ideas from 1998 to 2007. The researchers found such a project feasible, but did not continue research after NIAC closed. So LiftPort pursued the technology on its own.\n\nThe trickiest part of developing a space elevator is finding the right material for the tether.\n\nThe tether would have to withstand the weather in Earth's atmosphere, radiation from the sun, and impacts from meteorites and other debris.\n\nSpace-elevator advocates think carbon nanotubes could be the answer \u2014 the hollow tubes of carbon are just nanometers wide yet 100 times stronger than steel.\n\nThe problem is that these powerful fibers are a few meters long at most ?- nobody can get them anywhere near long enough to span the 22,000-plus miles (35 kilometres) required for a space elevator.\n\nAnother hurdle keeping space elevators in the realm of science fiction: space debris.\n\nThe European Space Agency estimates that 128 million objects smaller than 1 centimeter are orbiting Earth, along with another 900,000 objects that measure 1 to 10 centimeters.\n\nAny space elevator would be subject to collisions with these objects, so it would have to be capable of withstanding or out-maneuvering them.\n\nHowever, the moon doesn't contend with all that debris, and lower gravity there means that more materials could support their own weight. So some researchers think a lunar space elevator is a better place to start.\n\n\"The classical space elevator is a really tough problem because the Earth's gravity field is so great that you need such strong materials that we don't have right now,\" Jerome Pearson, an aerospace engineer who first proposed the lunar elevator in 1977, told NBC News. \"On the other hand, you could build a lunar space elevator with existing materials right now.\"\n\nUnlike a space elevator that rises from Earth, a lunar elevator would not use centrifugal force. Gravity would do all the work.\n\nAt LiftPort, Laine is also working on a lunar elevator concept. For the tether material, he has his eye on Dyneema, a polyethylene plastic fiber that's 15 times stronger than steel.\n\nBut Laine said Dyneema is not a \"Goldilocks material,\" since it doesn't hold up to radiation as well as he would like.\n\nLiftPort has also been experimenting with Kevlar and carbon nanotubes.\n\n\"We have a really good handle on the most probable materials, and that those materials will very likely work,\" Laine said.\n\nOne analysis calculated that a lunar elevator could pay for itself after 53 uses, since it could cut at least two-thirds of the cost of landing on the moon and reduce the cost of sample-return missions at least nine-fold.\n\nYou can read that full cost analysis here.\n\n\"There are a lot of advantages with a lunar space elevator,\" Pearson said. \"And with this new NASA program to return to the moon, there may be additional interest.\"\n\nFor now, though, any space elevator remains theoretical. \u201cThe big idea is still subject to a lot of details that we don\u2019t have the answers to,\" Laine said.\n\nHe added that the LiftPort team still needs to research the effects of rapid temperature changes that cargo would undergo as it ascended the space elevator. Work is also needed to determine how to protect cargo from solar radiation and how potential tether materials handle atmospheric changes. Then, of course, there are the complicated logistics of building such an elevator in the first place.\n\nIroning out those details is a slow process in these early stages. For now, it involves a lot of paperwork, complicated simulations, and financing efforts, Laine said.\n\n\"It's the boring, mundane task of building the biggest thing ever,\" he added.\n\nBut if a space elevator eventually becomes a reality, it could also help us access resources in space.\n\n\"Not only does it enable new space exploration and opportunities in space, but the way I look at it is using those resources to improve sustainability on Earth,\" Harris said.\n\nAsteroids can be literal treasure troves, since they contain valuable elements like gold, platinum, and iron. Mining materials on an asteroid could mean that we're not extracting those resources from the Earth.\n\nOnce we figure out how to extract valuable resources in space, that may open up possibilities for further exploration.\n\nFor example, water collected in space could be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel, which could then send spaceships further.\n\n\"To enable us access to all of these space resources, we need to find a better, cheaper way to get into orbit,\" Harris said.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "A space elevator could make it easier, cheaper, and more sustainable to transport cargo and people from the surface of Earth or the moon to space.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7890/6c8a4708004a43a19c0e566697c11092.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
