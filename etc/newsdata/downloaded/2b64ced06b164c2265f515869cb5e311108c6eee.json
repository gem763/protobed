In an anonymous letter to Infosys board of directors and US Securities and Exchange Commission, the whistleblower accused them of indulging in aggressive accounting practices to hide showing losses on large deals to investors. Some of these large deals included Verizon (NYSE: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ), JVs in Japan, and ABN AMRO (AS: ). The letter also stated that the company did not recognize visa costs in its financial statements to inflate the profitability. Markets treat the corporate governance issues very seriously, and it is no wonder that Infosys stock plunged by 16% in today\u2019s trading.\n\nThere was a time when Infosys was considered to be one of the most ethical companies when its original founders, who included Narayana Murthy and Nandan Nilekani, used to run the company. In fact, its quarterly results were considered a flag-bearer of how the earnings for the whole corporate sector in India would pan out.\n\nHowever, after the exit of its founders, and when Vishal Sikka was made the CEO of Infosys in June 2014, the problems for the company began. Vishal Sikka got into trouble after the company was accused of deliberately overpaying for the acquisition of Panaya. SEBI also found that the company violated regulations related to a severance package that was awarded to its former CFO Rajiv Bansal. SEBI charged the company of not taking prior approval from the board of directors by providing Bansal\u2019s severance details. These allegations meant that Vishal Sikka had to resign in August 2017.\n\nYesterday was indeed a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu moment for Infosys. Corporate governance issues generally take a long time to settle, and hence I don\u2019t expect the stock to make a big comeback soon. In fact, if there is no progress made in this case, the stock could see more declines in the near term.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Investing.com (Puneet Sikka/Investing.com) covering: Intel Corporation, Verizon Communications Inc, Infosys Ltd, ABN AMRO Group NV.
