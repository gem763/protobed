Obviously we know he is going to come out strong tomorrow and we just have to be right there to put up a fight.\u201d\n\nWarner, winner of Pan Am Games gold in August, got the competition off to a flying start by clocking the top time in the 100 of 10.35 seconds and was second best in the long jump.\n\nBut the Canadian could do no better than eighth in shot put while Mayer had a personal best of 16.82 to take over top spot after three events.\n\nWarner jumped 2.02m in the high jump to edge out the Frenchman who had 1.99, enabling the Canadian to trim Mayer\u2019s advantage to 11 points.\n\nIt came down to the 400m to decide who would lead at the end of the day.\n\nRunning in the final of three heats, LePage left the field in his wake as he clocked the top time and personal best of 47.35 seconds that shot him into second overall.\n\nWarner came across the line in fifth in 48.12 but that was enough to vault him into the lead ahead of Mayer, who struggled home in 12th in 48.99.\n\n\u201cAll things considered I did not perform at my best,\u201d said Mayer. \u201cI still recorded some PBs (personal bests) but did not enjoy it as much.\n\n\u201cI hope to regain my rhythm tomorrow to better enjoy the competition. The events where I struggle the most are over.\n\n\u201cMy second day is better so I can\u2019t wait.\u201d", "description": "Canada's Damian Warner snatched the lead after the opening day of decathlon competition at the world athletics championships on Wednesday but will have restless night with world record holder and defending champion Kevin Mayer lurking just 30 points back.", "authors": ["Steve Keating", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436420045&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911XN-OCASP"}
