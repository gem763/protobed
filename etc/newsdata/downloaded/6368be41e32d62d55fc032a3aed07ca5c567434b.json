Mr. Mulvaney later stated, \u201cthere was absolutely no quid pro quo.\u201d\n\n\u201cTizzy! Damn, Grisham\u2019s a truth-teller,\u201d Mr. Cooper joked. \u201cI mean, you know what, let the chips fall where they may. Stephanie don\u2019t care. Does everyone working for the president have to debase themselves and lie like he does? Apparently so. I thought John Grisham was a great storyteller, but I got to say, Stephanie Grisham may have him beat.\u201d\n\nIn an email to Business Insider, Ms. Grisham defended herself as a \u201csingle mom\u201d who is \u201cdoing the very best\u201d at juggling her work and private life.\n\n\u201cI think CNN has lost sight of the fact that we are human beings,\u201d she said. \u201cJust as Anderson Cooper has a job to do, working for a company he is proud of, so do I. I also imagine he has a personal life, where he has to juggle quite a bit \u2014 and the same goes for me.\u201d\n\nMs. Grisham has not held a single formal news briefing since she was promoted from press secretary to the first lady in July.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
