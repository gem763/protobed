USA TODAY\n\nThe FBI has released toxicology test results related to the deaths of three U.S. tourists in the Dominican Republic, according to the U.S. Department of State.\n\nThe results of the toxicology testing to date have been \"consistent with the findings of local authorities,\" who have said there was no indication of foul play or physical violence in either case, a spokesperson for the State Department told USA TODAY.\n\nThe toxicology reports were for cases involving Miranda Schaup-Werner, who died May 25 in her hotel room, and Cynthia Day and Nathaniel Holmes, who died on May 30 at a sister resort.\n\nEarly reports indicated Schaup-Werner, 41, of Pennsylvania, collapsed after consuming a drink from the minibar at the Luxury Bahia Principe Bouganville. Dominican authorities later said she died of a heart attack.\n\nHolmes, 63, and Day, 49, a couple from Maryland, were found dead in their hotel room at the Playa Nueva Romana resort. Preliminary autopsy results released by Dominican authorities indicated the couple died of respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, a condition caused by excess fluid in the lungs, according to CNN and CBS News.\n\nThe test results have been provided to the Dominican government and to the families of the deceased.\n\nThe tests conducted ruled out several potential causes of death for Day and Holmes, including methanol poisoning from tainted alcohol, the spokesperson said.\n\nAt least 10 U.S. tourists have died in the Dominican Republic since March. CNN reported in June the FBI was assisting with toxicology analysis in three of the deaths.\n\nUSA TODAY has asked the State Department about additional cases.\n\nAfter some of the deaths led to questions about hotel room minibars, the Hard Rock Casino took the precaution of removing liquor dispensers from guest rooms there as well as at its Mexican properties.\n\nIn August, a resort temporarily closed after thousands of visitors canceled following a woman's report she had been beaten at the property.\n\nIn the wake of the reported deaths, the country began elevating safety regulations and enforcing food and drink inspections.\n\nIn September, the Dominican Republic Minister of Tourism Francisco Javier Garc\u00eda held a briefing to discuss the ministry's commitment to tourist safety, announcing a National Committee of Tourism Security.\n\n\"Dominican Republic is a country that tries to safeguard the lives of tourists,\" said Garc\u00eda.\n\nContributing: Julia Thompson\n\nReport: US-to-Dominican Republic flight bookings rebounding after tourist deaths\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2019/10/18/dominican-republic-deaths-fbi-testing-shows-no-tainted-alcohol/4024849002/", "description": "The results of the toxicology testing to date have been \"consistent with the findings of local authorities,\"", "authors": ["Morgan Hines", "Published P.M.
