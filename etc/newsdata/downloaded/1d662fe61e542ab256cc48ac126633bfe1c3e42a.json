Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, and Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat, the report took a look at the costs of the federal government being fully or partially shut for 52 days over the past five years. Read the report.\n\nLawmakers said of the nearly $4 billion cost, at least $3.7 billion was for back pay for federal workers who were furloughed, while another $338 million was for other costs including extra administrative work and late fees on interest payments. The report also estimated 56,938 years of lost productivity for furloughed employees.\n\nThe total cost is likely higher, the lawmakers said, since agencies including the Department of Defense didn\u2019t provide information about furloughs and other relevant data.\n\nPortman is the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs\u2019 Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, while Carper is the subcommittee\u2019s top Democrat.\n\nThe report was released as lawmakers are facing a Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government for the next fiscal year or face another shutdown. The House is expected to vote next week on legislation that would avert a shutdown.\n\nSee: Congress set for maneuvering to avoid another government shutdown.\n\nThe most recent partial shutdown lasted 35 days and ended on Jan. 25. The report also covers a brief shutdown in January 2018 and a 16-day closure in October 2013.\n\nPortman has introduced legislation that would prevent future shutdowns.", "description": "The last three government shutdowns cost American taxpayers around $4 billion, according to a bipartisan investigation released on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HB447_govtsh_ZG_20190107115230.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
