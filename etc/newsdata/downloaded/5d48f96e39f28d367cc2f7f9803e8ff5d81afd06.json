Black Mirror is officially happening guys. It\u2019s here\"\n\nBut Caroline wouldn't let her get away with it.\n\nShe cheekily responded: \"Have you managed to see a copy before me ? Please forward .. am desperate to see..\"\n\nIt seems Jameela, 33, stayed quiet after that, but Caroline's response sparked a lot of comeback from fans.\n\nOne asked her: \"How can you be so defensive about a show this toxic and exploitative that you\u2019re willingly hosting?\"\n\n(Image: David Buchan/Variety/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nCaroline, 39, hit back: \"Because I\u2019ve filmed it and the people who have taken part are amazing and have been through a lot and life is about individual choice ...\"\n\nAnother fan asked: \"Are you saying it's not how the article suggested? Is it done in a 'positive, compassionate way'?\n\n\"After reading about your personal journey with your mental health I'm surprised at your choice of job but ultimately they would have got another presenter.\"\n\nCaroline responded: \"Well mental health is a sensitive subject and as we progress we are constantly asked to be more open and visible.\n\n(Image: carolineflack/Instagram)\n\n\"My feeling toward the show is that it opens up conversations on why some people turn to surgery to help them lead the life that they believe will make them happier.\"\n\nEveryone who takes part on the show needs to convince at least 75 per cent of the jury in order to be awarded their surgery.\n\nAnd they'll go back a few months later to show off the results.\n\nIt was filmed in Manchester and is expected to air on the show in 2020.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
