I remember it as a very stressful time: we didn\u2019t know what changes were going to be made and this uncertainty caused a lot of stress.\n\nWe\u2019d get a few minutes of respite at lunchtime, when I used to enjoy checking out the local shops and caf\u00e9s. I would have a quick look at the clothes in The Duffer of St George \u2013 this went on to become a big thing \u2013 and scan the shelves at Honest Jon\u2019s record shop.\n\nMy favourite caf\u00e9 was over the road: it was so laid-back that I don\u2019t think it even had a name. Notting Hill was very different back then. I can remember sitting watching the people working in the caf\u00e9 and enviously thinking they didn\u2019t seem to have a care in the world.\n\nI think it played a big part in me wanting to work in their world rather than mine. They didn\u2019t have the hopes and education of 60 children in their hands. Nor the bureaucracy that went with it; to say nothing of the marking and lesson planning, which often went on until midnight.", "description": "Way back when the Government was introducing GCSEs to replace O-levels, I was teaching history at a school on Portobello Road.", "authors": ["Stephen Harris", "Chef", "Owner Of The Sportsman"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/food-and-drink/2019/10/02/TELEMMGLPICT000209902301-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
