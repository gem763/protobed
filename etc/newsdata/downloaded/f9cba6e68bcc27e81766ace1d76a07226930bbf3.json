It's doesn't get much closer \ud83d\udc40 Serge Aurier has a goal ruled out as Son was fractionally offside in the build-up. \ud83d\udcfa BT Sport 1 HD pic.twitter.com/3GWCY5paML\n\nTake Saturday's game between Leicester and Tottenham where Spurs star Son Heung-min was adjudged to have been offside in the lead up to his side's second goal.\n\nThe ruling, which came after a lengthy two-minute review, showed Son to be millimeters offside.\n\nWhile sports such as cricket and rugby have managed to use video technology without too much controversy in recent years, the Premier League appears to be having teething problems in these early stages.\n\nGary Lineker, a former Leicester, Tottenham and England star turned presenter, tweeted that VAR \"could and should benefit the game but at present it's sucking the life out of it.\"\n\nTottenham's pain was compounded by conceding an equalizer and then seeing James Maddison lash home an 85th-minute winner for Leicester.\n\nA screen displays the VAR decision to disallow Serge Aurier's goal for Spurs at Leicester.\n\n\"We need to accept that it's completely fair, the rules,\" Mauricio Pochettino, the Tottenham coach, told reporters after the game.\n\n\"I'm not disappointed with that, I'm disappointed because we conceded two goals and the emotion of the game changed.\n\n\"Giving that decision to Leicester made that thing happen in the last 10 minutes. At 2-0 the game is going to be different, when VAR disallowed the goal 2-0 is not the same as 1-0 with 80 minutes.\n\n\"That is normal that it changes the emotions. For us it was a massive disappointment and for them it was a massive belief for all the people and fans to keep pushing and they found the way to score a goal.\n\n\"In the end, we all thought it was going to be a draw and the goal appeared from long distance and it killed our feeling.\"\n\nCesar Azpilicueta of Chelsea gestures after his goal was ruled out by VAR.\n\nPochettino was not alone in his assessment. Frank Lampard, the Chelsea manager, felt similarly after his side had a goal chalked off during its 2-1 home defeat by Liverpool.\n\nChelsea was trailing 1-0 when Cesar Azpilicueta appeared to have equalized from close range.\n\nThe Spaniard ran away to celebrate only for the goal to be ruled out for offside by VAR. Though the decision was correct, Chelsea, having been celebrating only moments earlier, soon conceded a second goal.\n\n\"We have to get on with it and it's a sad thing for the celebrations but we are looking for the correct decisions,\" Lampard told Sky Sports after the game on Sunday.\n\n\"It definitely changes the atmosphere in the crowd and on the pitch and it's deflating a little bit, and obviously they get a boost from it.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Mohamed Salah on VAR and Liverpool role Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mohamed Salah on VAR and Liverpool role 05:58\n\nAccording to the rules, the use of VAR technology is limited to four types of incident.\n\nGoals -- whether they should stand or ruled out because of potential violations (fouls, offside, etc) in the build up.\n\nPenalties -- if the referee has made the correct decision in either awarding one or not following an incident in the box.\n\nStraight red cards -- to make sure an incident on the pitch receives the correct ruling from the referee.\n\nCases of mistaken identity -- when a referee awards a yellow or red card to the wrong player.\n\nTrailing 3-2, Villa felt it should have been awarded a penalty when Arsenal defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos appeared to block Conor Hourihane's shot inside the penalty area was his arm.\n\nAs the players appealed for the penalty, referee Jon Moss waved away the appeals with VAR not correcting the call.\n\nEmerick Aubameyang of Arsenal scores his team's scores his team's third goal against Villa.\n\nEarlier last month, English referees' chief Mike Riley revealed that VAR had made four mistakes in the first four rounds of matches.\n\n\"We are learning as we go along and we are constantly improving,\" Riley, who heads up England's elite refereeing body, PGMOL, told Sky Sports News.\n\n\"Out of the four match rounds, there have been some really good examples where we have intervened. There have been six incidents where VAR has advised the referee and we have got a better decision as a result.\n\n\"There were four incidents where VAR didn't intervene and had they done, we would have a better understanding of the role VAR plays in the game. [The mistakes] are all about the judgment of VAR and the process that we adopt. These are examples where VAR could have had a benefit and intervened to help the referee on the day.\"", "description": "The English Premier League season is only six games old and already the constant debate surrounding VAR has become almost as customary as a pre-match pint and halftime pie.", "authors": ["James Masters"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190923124844-var-leicester-tottenham-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
