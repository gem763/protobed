Aged 39, his wealth was estimated at $77 million on last year\u2019s Young Rich List.\n\nA new understanding of his endorsement income has seen his estimated wealth swell to $202 million, putting him in 20th spot on this year\u2019s list.\n\nAdam Scott: \"There\u2019s a big sense of achievement in making these team events.\"\n\nConsistency off and on the course has been a hallmark of a professional career that started in 2000. For much of that time, Scott has enjoyed the backing of three key partners: luxury watch giant Rolex, Japanese clothing group Uniqlo and golf equipment maker Titleist.\n\nAlthough his focus is firmly on the course, his partnerships give him a rarefied view into the inner workings of some successful companies. Scott cites Uniqlo founder Tadashi Yanai as one of the most impressive business people he\u2019s come across.\n\n\u201cThe humility of the man who\u2019s created this huge clothing company is quite impressive. The way he deals with the ups and downs over such a long period and on a global scale; he just handles it so well.\u201d\n\nAlthough Scott says he\u2019s not contemplating retirement, his sponsors have given him a peek into life after golf. Rolex sponsors the Venice Biennale of Architecture, a subject close to the heart of his wife, Marie Kojzar, who is an architect.\n\n\u201cDevelopment in a broad sense interests me,\u201d he says. \u201cGiven the fact I live in hotels, I\u2019m interested in having a really nice boutique hotel that I\u2019d love to stay at.\u201d\n\nThe November issue of AFR Magazine, including the Young Rich List, is out on Friday, October 25 inside The Australian Financial Review.
