If they\u2019re unable to pass the test after two tries, their press credentials could be at risk.\n\nAs first reported by China Media Project and South China Morning Post, journalists working in Chinese state media were recently notified of the impending test by the country\u2019s media regulator. The test will be based on teachings found in a controversial app \u2015 loosely translated as \u201cStudy Xi, Strong Nation\u201d \u2014 introduced by the government earlier this year.\n\n#China \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3: Journalists in Chinese state media are to be tested on loyalty to Xi Jinping. Updated press cards will only be issued to journalists who have passed the exam. #shame #PressFreedom https://t.co/CvCSJoep8M via @scmpnews \u2014 IFJ (@IFJGlobal) September 20, 2019\n\nThe app, which has been compared to the late Chairman Mao Zedong\u2019s \u201cLittle Red Book,\u201d contains articles, video clips and other media about Xi\u2019s political philosophy, according to the Morning Post.\n\nThe app, which Chinese citizens have been strongly encouraged to use by Xi\u2019s government, scores users on a point system and keeps track of users\u2019 progress.\n\nThe most downloaded app in China feeds its users propaganda in a bid to build up Xi's cult of personality. pic.twitter.com/mPxQWOZpwT \u2014 SCMP News (@SCMPNews) April 15, 2019\n\nThe test for journalists is not expected to be very difficult, but will include questions on Xi\u2019s \u201cteachings on socialism for the new era\u201d and \u201cimportant thoughts on propaganda,\u201d The Guardian reported, citing Media Reform, a news account on the Chinese social media platform WeChat.\n\nSome 10,000 reporters and editors are expected to sit for \u201cpilot tests\u201d in early October before nationwide tests are conducted, the Morning Post said.\n\nThe country\u2019s media regulator said in its notice that journalists will need to pass the test in order to renew their press credentials. If they fail the first time, they\u2019ll be allowed to retake the test just once.\n\n\u201cFrom the top down to the bottom, I don\u2019t think anyone will be able to escape it,\u201d a reporter from a broadcaster in eastern Shandong province told The Guardian of the exam.\n\nChina is ranked 177 out of 180 in Reporters Without Borders\u2019 2019 World Press Freedom Index, surpassing only Eritrea, North Korea and Turkmenistan.\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
