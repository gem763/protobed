Sitting in her top floor one-bedroom flat, she insists on sitting with a photograph of her brother, Christy Smith, by her side.\n\nChristy was sent to an industrial school while her mother, pregnant with Mary, was put into a Magdalene Laundry at Peacock Lane in Cork in 1952.\n\nTheir mother was 34 when she died. Mary never met her.\n\n\u201cWithout a mother\u2019s love, you\u2019ll never be right.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that, then the rest of your life is destroyed.\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Mary - beyond that she was born in Fermoy in east Cork \u2013 until she was three.\n\nShe was brought up at St Aloysius\u2019 Industrial School for Roman Catholic Girls, in Clonakilty.\n\nUntil she was 14, Mary never knew her date of birth, or even what a birthday was.\n\nThere was no toothpaste, there were no mirrors. All the girls had the same haircut.\n\nInstead of being called by name, each girl had a number. Mary said hers was 1,346.\n\nAs far back as Mary can remember, she was put to work in the laundry. She was so small that she had to stand on top of a pile of stacked pallets to reach the sink.\n\n\u201cWe had to wash sanitary towels. I didn\u2019t even know what they were at the time,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe had to scrub them and the nun would give you a thump to keep going.\u201d\n\nEven though Mary never went to school, she and the other girls would clean the rooms of a nearby boarding school.\n\nOne of the worst beatings Mary can remember is when she and another girl asked a child at the boarding school what it was like to go to school.\n\nThe nun caught them and told them to get back to work.\n\n\u201cLater that night she came in and she called me and the other girl. I thought I was dead I got such a beating,\u201d said Mary.\n\nShe remembers it well. The nun had a stick in one hand and a leather strap in the other.\n\n\u201cShe lashed me and told me: \u2018You\u2019re not to talk to people,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI fell to the ground and she was beating me, just for talking to the outside world.\u201d\n\nSometimes, Mary would be sent to work on a farm for a day. On those days, she would not be fed. She was so hungry, she would eat the chicken feed to sustain her.\n\nWhen she reached puberty, the nuns put a wrap around her chest to flatten her breasts.\n\nEvery Saturday she wore a red petticoat down to the floor to take her bath.\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t allowed to look at your body developing,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen Mary was 14, the Clonakilty industrial school closed down and she was transferred to St Joseph\u2019s Industrial School for Girls in Mallow.\n\n\u201cThe regime there was completely different. I got a uniform and I started to go to school,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was there that Mary was told what money was for the first time when she was given a small allowance to go to the local carnival.\n\nThere she met a young man who bought her an ice-cream.\n\n\u201cI was stunned that someone could hand me something. I thought it was my birthday, because I knew you get presents on your birthday,\u201d she said.\n\nMary and the young man fell in love. It was the happiest time of her life.\n\n\u201cIt was like I was in another world,\u201d she said.\n\nBut her time in Mallow lasted little more than a year.\n\nA woman from a town 27 miles away came to the school and asked Mary to work for her. At first, Mary did not want to leave. But when the woman came asking for her a second time, she agreed.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be a great escape. Little did I know, worse was to come for me,\u201d she said.\n\nMary said the house to which she was brought was a large one, but that her room was tiny, and she shared it with the brushes and the hoover.\n\n\u201cThe woman told me: \u2018You\u2019re my slave now,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nHer boyfriend from Mallow wrote to her and she started writing to him.\n\n\u201cHe sent me a photo and I remember burning my hand on an iron I was looking at it so hard and not paying attention,\u201d said Mary.\n\nWhen the woman of the house found out about the letters, she called the \u201ccruelty man\u201d.\n\nThe \u201ccruelty men\u201d, also known as the \u201cpoverty men\u201d, were officers who worked for the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC).\n\nIreland\u2019s Child Abuse Commission found that ISPCC officers played an important role in committing children to residential care.\n\nIn 2006, the chief executive of the ISPCC at the time, Paul Gilligan, told the commission: \u201cIt is reasonable to suspect that we certainly would have committed a significant number to the industrial schools.\n\n\"But I really have no idea about the overall percentage.\u201d\n\nOne day, Mary was told to go into the parlour where the \u201ccruelty man\u201d was waiting for her.\n\n\u201cHe started talking about my mother,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe told me: \u2018You\u2019re getting more like your mother.\u2019\u201d\n\nThen the woman of the house told Mary that she would end up getting pregnant, packed her case and sent her to Sunday's Well Magdalene Laundry in Cork.\n\n\u201cAll I heard [the \u201ccruelty man\u201d] say when he left me there is: \u2018I have another one for you,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhen that door locked my body went into shellshock. I\u2019ve never moved on from that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t eat for them. They had to tie my hands behind my back to get me to eat. But I wouldn\u2019t. I wanted to die.\n\n\u201cWhat was the point in living if I was going to be in there for the rest of my life?\u201d\n\nMary\u2019s hair was shaved. Her name was changed to Mair\u00e9ad. She was told not to talk.\n\nShe was 16 years old.\n\nMary said she spent almost a year at Sunday\u2019s Well, before being sent for again by the woman for whom she had worked before.\n\nShe was put to work again. Her boyfriend was never told where she went and there was no way to contact him.\n\nThree months later, the woman of the house rang for the \u201ccruelty man\u201d again when she saw Mary speaking to the bread man.\n\nThe \u201ccruelty man\u201d put her into his black van. She was crying hysterically, she said.\n\nMary remembers the next part of the story vividly.\n\n\u201cThe car stopped. I didn\u2019t know where I was,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI pulled my hands from my face and looked up. I saw we were at a field or something. It was the middle of nowhere.\n\n\u201cI thought to myself: \u2018This is great. I\u2019m going to escape.\u2019\n\n\u201cI opened the door and started running.\n\n\u201cI remember exactly what I was wearing. I had a navy skirt and I had blue tights on me.\n\n\u201cI ran. The next thing, he knocked me to the ground and pulled down my tights and raped me.\u201d\n\nMary never went back to Sunday\u2019s Well. Instead the \u201ccruelty man\u201d took her to a hostel, where she lived for two weeks before it closed down.\n\nWith nowhere to go, she settled on the streets of Cork, homeless.", "description": "", "authors": ["Leanna Byrne"], "top_image": "https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/include/extra/shorthand/assets/news/BoWIe4x0Lj/assets/ZxIMyWhDrk/newheader_wide-2560x1440.jpeg"}
