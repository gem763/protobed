At the time, he accused the GOP of \u201crunning a lynch mob.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the president\u2019s defender in the sense that I haven\u2019t seen anything yet that would rise, in my opinion, to the level of impeachable offense,\u201d Nadler said at the time. \u201cI wish we could get this over with quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn pushing the process, in pushing the arguments of fairness and due process the Republicans so far have been running a lynch mob,\u201d he added.\n\nThis is not the first time the terminology has been used to describe issues in the political realm.
