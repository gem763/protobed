He strode to the first tee like the mayor of Napa, shaking hands and posing for pictures and introducing himself to nearly everyone within reach.\n\nDressed in a black shirt and white shorts, Lefty now officially qualifies as svelte. The weight-loss program he started at The Open in July has him nearly 30 pounds trimmer, back to the top end of his weight range when he was in college at Arizona State in the early \u201890s. The physique overhaul has injected a youthful vibrancy, as a man who is fast approaching his 50th birthday tries everything he can to turn back the clock.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe laid-back antics continued throughout the round, with Curry and Mickelson chatting their way around the North Course. Mickelson offered advice on the greens for the two-time NBA MVP, and both made a detour on the third hole to try their hand at a long-distance champagne cork shot contest. The two even shared in Curry\u2019s signature shimmy dance move after Mickelson rolled in a 15-foot birdie on the final hole.\n\nThere were plenty of laughs, smiles and thumbs-up for the NorCal fans who came out to witness a cross-sport intersection. It also happened to put the actual golf on the back burner for the five-time major champ.\n\nStory continues\n\nMickelson has been something of a revelation in recent months, turning over a new leaf that few thought he had in him even after standing at the forefront of the sport for more than two decades. His Twitter account has taken social media by storm, featuring video chats with other players and advice on how to build the best calves in equal measure. It\u2019s a light-hearted window into the dry humor and savage one-liners that have previously been reserved for the inside of Tour locker rooms.\n\nThe Social: Phil trades barbs, jabs and insults with the master, Larry David\n\nSafeway Open: Full-field tee times | Full coverage\n\n\u201cIt made me laugh because at the beginning of it, my buddies are like, \u2018It\u2019s not him.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Trust me, it\u2019s him.\u2019 If you read the stuff he says back and watch everything, it\u2019s nobody but Phil,\u201d said Justin Thomas. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a day and age where social media kind of takes over the world and it is bizarre, but I think he\u2019s enjoying it a lot more than he thought he was going to. I know I am.\u201d\n\nThe explosion of Mickelson\u2019s off-course makeover, replete with exercise tips and candid beach snapshots, has coincided with a dramatic drop-off of his on-course form. A victory at the AT&T Pebble Beach in February that signaled a possible breakthrough instead led to an improbable slide, one that again left him short of the Tour Championship and featured just a single top-35 finish in 16 subsequent starts.\n\nWhile the terms \"Mickelson\" and \"consistent\" have never exactly been intertwined, this year was uncharted territory. At multiple points he spoke with candor about his active search for a spark or turnaround coming up empty.\n\n\u201cProbably the worst six months of my career,\u201d Mickelson said Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m determined to fix it.\u201d\n\nBarring a sudden turnaround, Mickelson is about to miss playing in his first U.S. team event since the 1993 Ryder Cup. His world ranking, which has dropped from 17th to 43rd since his Pebble victory, must stay inside the top 60 by next spring or Mickelson might not automatically qualify for the U.S. Open.\n\nMore so than any of his peers, Mickelson has found effective tools with which to keep Father Time at bay. But no one can hold out forever.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t mentally sharp or focused the last five or six months, and it led to some very poor play,\u201d Mickelson said. \u201cI\u2019m taking a little bit of a different route this time. I\u2019m not going to put as many hours in and I\u2019m going to try to be more focused on the time I do put in and enjoy it a little more and see if I can get it turned around.\u201d\n\nSo as the fan-friendly sideshow reached wine country with Mickelson set to begin his 29th season as a pro, it perhaps sheds light on what the next chapter might hold for the crowd favorite. Few expect him to bolt for PGA Tour Champions once he celebrates a milestone birthday in June, and it\u2019s unlikely that he\u2019ll parse away any additional practice time for side projects like course design.\n\nInstead Mickelson has carved out yet another niche, one where he explores the whimsical side of the game and gives fans a peek behind the curtain. It\u2019s talk of flexing calves and dropping bombs, and it\u2019s a medium that plays to all his greatest strengths. It\u2019s also one that doesn\u2019t require on-course success to resonate with those attending tournaments or following on Twitter.\n\nWith two tournament wins in the last 18 months, Mickelson isn\u2019t turning his back on competition anytime soon. The disappointment is evident in his tone whenever he references his summer swoon, and he remains resolute in his stated plans to get the ship righted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just frustrating when you know you can perform a certain way and you don\u2019t,\u201d Mickelson said. \u201cI\u2019ll get it figured out. I always have in the past. I\u2019ve gone through ups and downs in the past, and I\u2019ll figure it out. Hopefully I already have.\u201d\n\nBut all the leg exercises and juice cleanses in the world can\u2019t stave off inevitable decline forever. There\u2019s still a chance that Mickelson\u2019s game will continue to vex him into 2020 and beyond, that the drives will wobble and the putts will slide by.\n\nBut should Mickelson\u2019s drought linger, it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019s going anywhere. Instead he might simply have more time and energy to devote to becoming the Tour\u2019s latest social media star, as one of the two most popular players of a generation has discovered a way to relate to fans and maintain popularity even in the face of over-par scores. If nothing else, it would be the latest iteration of a career that left a broken mold in its wake years ago.", "description": "Phil Mickelson has turned over a new leaf of sorts as he attempts so ward off Father Time, embracing social media and a new fitness regimen before kicking off his 29th season.
