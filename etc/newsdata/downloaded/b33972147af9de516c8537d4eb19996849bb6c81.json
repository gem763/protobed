The allegation, corroborated by a memorandum of the conversation released by the White House, prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump's actions.\n\nThe complaint also denounced a rogue diplomatic effort by Giuliani to exert pressure on the newly elected government in Ukraine. The whistleblower said top U.S. diplomats became involved in Giuliani's outreach and helped broker a meeting he had with one of Zelensky's advisers.\n\nAlthough it has confirmed that the top U.S. envoy to Ukraine at the time helped arrange the meeting, the State Department said Giuliani did not speak \"on behalf\" of the U.S. government.\n\nBut Murphy said it is clear that Giuliani was exploiting his important connection to the president to portray himself as an arm of America's diplomatic corps.\n\n\"You can understand how the Ukrainians are confused when the personal representative of the president is coming to them and asking them to help destroy one of his political rivals,\" Murphy said. \"And you can also understand how they might be concerned that if they don't do the bidding of the president of the United States there might be consequences that come to them.\"", "description": "Murphy said he warned the Ukrainian government not to meddle in America's elections", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/29/27a40240-9f6c-41a2-9360-21d873bb925f/thumbnail/1200x630/fe57747a2f945a93c8d21d05b49ebdff/murphy2.png", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
