Bond yields rose. Global growth may pick up soon from massive easing by 45 central banks over the last 6 months. The US-China relations may de-escalate even if there is no deal. Q3 earnings season start this week.\n\nThe fall in rates may be coming to an end.\n\nPg 9, Streetwise: Millennials will drive retail CRI, PLCE, BBBY; restaurants CMG; REITs WELL, EQIX, HCP.\n\nPg 12-13: Q3 earnings season starts on Tuesday. [A critical week for Brexit but it seems that Barron\u2019s got tired of it]\n\nWith power cuts in CA, backup power company Generac [GNRC] has surged. It recently bought Pika Energy [batteries] and Neurio Technology [energy use monitoring].\n\nBrokers wars [low fees/commissions] will have casualties [ETFC, etc?]. Stocks of asset managers [BLK, STT, IVZ, etc] and brokers [SCHW, AMTD, ETFC, etc] have sold off. Shift from active funds to low-cost, no-commission passive funds will continue.\n\nData this week: NY Fed Empire State manufacturing index on Tuesday; retail sales, housing market index, business inventories on Wednesday; housing starts. Industrial production on Thursday; LEI on Friday.\n\nClosed: US bond market on Monday. Canadian stock market on Monday.\n\nBullish Recommendations: J&J [JNJ; fwd P/E 14.3; recent court losses shouldn\u2019t worry investors \u2013 JNJ is an aggressive litigator; market is pricing $40 billion in legal liability when $12 billion may be more reasonable; pg 11];\n\nKellog [K; yield 3.7%; fwd P/E 16.1; snacks (growing) 50.2%, cereals (declining) 38.4%, other 11.4%; divested Keebler in July; distributes now to warehouses, not stores; expanding in EMs; pg 17].\n\nBearish Recommendations: None self-standing\n\nPg 14: This 13th round of US-China trade talks led to a mini-deal or phase 1 with agreements on the US delaying tariff increases that were scheduled for Oct 15 and Chinese buying $40-50 billion in the US agricultural products; there were some vague references to IP and currencies. Beware that talks may breakdown. There are also new potential or tentative issues \u2013 the US blacklisting several Chinese companies; visa restrictions; preventing government pension funds to invest in Chinese companies; restricting capital flows into China; delisting of Chinese companies from US exchanges. China also put some restrictions on US companies/organizations [AAPL, GOOGL; NBA] as it tried to contain protests in HK. The IMF said that the US-China trade war may reduce global growth by $700 billion by the end of 2020. While the US exports to China are small [about $180 billion], the US companies generate $544 billion in revenues in China. Risk is that the trade war may grow into tech war and capital war. Lewis Kaufman of ARTYX likes European multinationals with China exposure. Christopher Smart of Baring s says to avoid US-listed Chinese companies/ADRs. Rajiv Jain of GQG likes US companies with moderate valuations that compete with Chinese companies; he also says that this may be an opportunity to sell as a comprehensive US-China deal is unlikely.\n\nPg 16: Lester Ross, WilmertHale law firm with office in Beijing since 2004. President Xi has reversed some of the reforms made after China joined the WTO. There is more censorship. There may be a limited US-China trade agreement. Some export-oriented manufacturing has been moving away from China.\n\nPg 18: Cover Story, \u201cHow to Maximize Your Income\u201d A milestone was reached when some Greek rates became negative. The US and global/EM rates look juicy in comparison. There are also bond proxies \u2013 REITs, utilities, telecoms, MLPs, banks. The yield-curve is partially inverted and sort of flat overall. After-tax real-yields are not high for fixed-income. Bond fund inflows are strong, especially for bond ETFs. Risk is if the rates go up. Consider short-term bond funds [MAFRX, PFIAX; JPST, MINT, SHY, SHV; T-Bills (BRK/Buffett holds $120 billion)], corporates [from DUK, D, F, GM, UHAL], general and multisector bond funds [DLTNX; PONAX, LSBRX, JIPAX; AGG, BND, IAGG], EM bonds [EMB], munis [MKINX, VWITX, EALTX; MMHAX; NEA, BTT], HY [VWEHX, MHHIX; GHY, HYT, VTA], preferreds [PFF].\n\nPg 22: The ECB move to negative rates in mid-2014 was supposed to be temporary but here we are. European banks are in trouble, even the German banks. Banks didn\u2019t complain in the beginning as their bond portfolios went up and their borrowing costs went down, but eventually their spreads and net interest income [NII] went down. EuroStoxx bank index is down -50% in 5 years and many bank P/B are in range 0.3-0.4. European banks haven\u2019t passed on negative rates to retail customers but have done that to corporate customers. The ECB says that banks benefit from economic recovery and should focus on cost reduction. There is global savings glut and rates may remain low for a long time.\n\nPg 24: Income from dividend aristocrats [dividend growth for 25+ years], ITW, JNJ, NUE, PNR, GWW.\n\nPg 25: Almost 25% of bonds globally have negative yields [YTM] and most of those are in Europe and Japan; even Greece and Italy recently borrowed at negative yields. There is savings glut in the developed world. Consumers are spending less and saving more, and businesses see no need for capex and more jobs. For most part, governments haven\u2019t taken up the slack [but the US is an exception]. It is not uncommon to have negative real-yields [16% of the time] although the 139-yr average is +2.6%. Typical causes of negative real-yields are wars or social collapse, but today it is stagnation. Governments can influence real-rates through fiscal and monetary policies but few are willing or able to do that now.\n\nPg 26: Videogame stocks are attractive \u2013 ATVI, SNE, MSFT, TTWO, EA.\n\nPg 27: Steve Shigekawa of real-estate NREAX [load 5.75%, ER 1.22%] holds about 40 positions. Hs overweight in infrastructure REITs [17%; cellphone towers, etc], apartment REITs [14%], data-centers [12%]; he is underweight in cyclical [7%] lodging, retail, etc. Geographically, he likes high-density coastal areas.\n\nPg 29: Active robo-advisor is coming with a partnership between Betterment and DFA . But there will be limited access to these.\n\nPg 30: David Giroux, PRWCX. Disruption is a big theme \u2013 streaming, etc. He likes growth utilities [disrupting coal utilities]; GE [likes CEO Culp]; payment software FISV; life sciences PKI; conglomerate FTV; bonds with some credit risks.\n\nPg 33: University endowments have underperformed stocks and 70-30 hybrids again in FY19 ending on 6/30/19. They were held back by alternatives \u2013 hedge-funds, private-equity, real-estate, etc.\n\nPg 34: Jim Grant, Current Yield. How are some Greek rates negative when the US money-market repo rates jumped to 10% in mid-September? Cash shortage! Powell said that shoring up the repo market is not QE. Fed primary dealers are required to carry huge inventory of Treasuries. Bond yields have continued to fall. He ends the piece with \u201cfree HK\u201d and \u201cfree rates\u201d pitch.\n\nExtras from Friday \u2013 I try to guess on Friday which features will make it in the weekend edition but the following guesses didn\u2019t make it. Almost 75-80% of the weekend edition is now available by 9:00 PM Central on Friday. Barron\u2019s revised website has \u201cInterests\u201d tabs similar to columns topics and that makes it easier to find potential items for the weekend edition. This is also the reason for earlier postings on Saturday \u2013 I do wait for my paper delivery [typically between 5:00-6:30 AM Central] to fill in some data.\n\nNone\n\nYBB", "description": "Pg 5, Up & Down Wall Street: Murphy\u2019s law worked in reverse this week \u2013 nothing bad happened on US-China trade and Brexit .
