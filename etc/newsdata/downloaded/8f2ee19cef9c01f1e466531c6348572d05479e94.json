Since 1976, however, most summer Games in the northern hemisphere have been held in the middle of summer to fit in with global broadcasting schedules.\n\n\"On top of pretty sophisticated measures they (Tokyo organizers) have already presented here today, they and we will continue to work on this,\" Bach said.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Organizers of next year's Tokyo Olympics are looking for new ways to battle the heat and are asking sports federations for advice, the International Olympic Committee said.
