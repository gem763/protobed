Eventually, \"I realized what a burden I put on myself by having these window blinders, and it was very freeing.\"\n\nTimothee Chalamet, left, and Joel Edgerton play best friends in arms in royal drama \"The King.\" (Photo: ROBERT DEUTSCH/USA TODAY)\n\n\"King\" follows defiant prince Hal (Chalamet) as he reluctantly ascends the English throne after his father's death and becomes King Henry V. But his hopes for a peaceful reign are quickly dashed after a perceived threat from the sneering Dauphin of France (Robert Pattinson), and Henry makes the difficult decision to wage war as he second-guesses his subjects' loyalty, save for trusted adviser Sir John Falstaff (Edgerton).\n\nHaving played Henry on stage in his native Australia, Edgerton was eager to tell a version of Shakespeare's story that depicted the battles in all their \"claustrophobic, dangerous, panicked\" messiness, without losing the characters' emotional integrity. But the gritty retelling struggled to find financing for years because of its period setting, until Netflix came on board and helped lure Chalamet, 23, who earned a best actor Oscar nomination for his breakthrough role in gay romance \"Call Me By Your Name.\"\n\nThe invasion of France by King Henry V (Timothee Chalamet) is at the center of Netflix's \"The King,\" which pulls from Shakespeare's trilogy of plays about the English ruler. (Photo: NETFLIX)\n\n\"If we had made it (earlier), it wouldn't have been Timmy,\" says Edgerton, 45. \"I would've had to drag him by his school bag out of eighth grade.\"\n\nBefore \"King,\" Chalamet mostly starred in low-budget, awards-friendly fare such as \"Lady Bird\" and \"Beautiful Boy,\" which made this film's epic scope daunting at first.\n\n\"Things that are scary are good, and this scared the (expletive) out of me,\" Chalamet says. But he was heartened by \"David's faith in the project and that I could do it. The goal was never to match what Sir Laurence Olivier and Sir Kenneth Branagh did (in past 'Henry V' movies), but rather to get a searing portrait of a young man with good intent, (who faces) circumstances beyond what he can control or affect.\"\n\n\"The character was so much a part of my imagination for the last 20 years,\" Joel Edgerton, left, says of Henry V, played by Timothee Chalamet in Netflix's \"The King.\" (Photo: ROBERT DEUTSCH/USA TODAY)\n\nPrior to shooting in England and Hungary last year, Chalamet spent a month and a half training to sword-fight and ride horses while wearing hulking suits of armor and chainmail: \"Not to get to a place of (butt)-kicking, but to a place of it being believable that I can hold my own in battles or duels,\" he says.\n\nIt was useful preparation for next year's ambitious sci-fi adventure \"Dune,\" in which he plays prophetic young leader Paul Atreides. Adapted from Frank Herbert's 1965 novel, and directed by Denis Villeneuve (\"Blade Runner 2049\"), the big-budget remake offers a \"grounded\" take on the mind-bending source material, Chalamet teases, and marks his most commercial project yet as a leading man.\n\n\"The King\" stars Lily-Rose Depp and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet at the Netflix drama's Venice Film Festival premiere last month. The rumored couple was spotted kissing on a yacht while in Italy. (Photo: VITTORIO ZUNINO CELOTTO/GETTY IMAGESmages)\n\nChalamet, for his part, seems primed for Hollywood stardom, appearing next as heartthrob Laurie in Greta Gerwig's highly anticipated \"Little Women\" (in theaters Christmas Day). He savvily sidesteps questions about working with \"King\" co-star and rumored girlfriend Lily-Rose Depp, who plays a small but impactful role as Henry's betrothed Catherine of Valois. (\"It was awesome and what great scenes,\" he says, expounding on her character's \"fearless, righteous\" nature.)\n\nAnd with more fame comes less privacy, which the New York native has taken with humility and humor. He graciously brought bagels to the Manhattan premiere of \"King\" last week and handed them out to feverish fans, many of whom have pinpointed his favorite local bagel haunt, where they wait outside on a regular basis to snap selfies with him.\n\n\"I was just saying to my mom the other day that I need to scope out some new bagel places,\" Chalamet says. \"Thankfully, New York is the best city in the world for that \u2013 it's not like looking for bagels in Paris.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/08/timothee-chalamet-talks-bowl-cuts-bagels-netflix-the-king/3898960002/", "description": "\"Call Me By Your Name\" breakout Timothee Chalamet is the stoic leading man of Netflix's epic drama \"The King,\" playing Henry V opposite Joel Edgerton.", "authors": ["Patrick Ryan", "Published P.M.
