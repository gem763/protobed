I mean obviously I can beat him again.\" before saying she's just kidding @NewsHour tonite \u2014 Judy Woodruff (@JudyWoodruff) October 8, 2019\n\nLast week, Clinton made a bizarre claim that Russia was \u201cgrooming\u201d Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), a 2020 Democrat presidential candidate and Hawaii Army National Guard major, and suggested she was a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d\n\nShe made the claim on \u201cCampaign HQ,\u201d a podcast that is hosted by former President Barack Obama\u2019s aide David Plouffe.\n\nClinton said of Gabbard:\n\nI think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She\u2019s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\n\nOn Sunday, she tweeted a fake letter dated October 16, 1962, from John F. Kennedy to Nikita Khrushchev that was supposed to emulate one recently written by Trump to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. She tweeted, \u201cFound in the archives\u2026\u201d\n\nFound in the archives\u2026 pic.twitter.com/iFFeqloYHM \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 20, 2019\n\nHer use of the word \u201carchives\u201d prompted some online to bring up her 30,000 deleted emails from her own email archives:\n\nSooo\u2026 you're saying this wasnt an attachment in one of the 30,000+ emails you deleted\u2026 \u2014 Tim Young (@TimRunsHisMouth) October 21, 2019\n\nA New York Times piece called Clinton a \u201cmaster troll\u201d who is \u201cliving her best life.\u201d\n\nNYT: Hillary is \"living her best life\" by smearing Gabbard and tweeting boomer memes at Drumpf https://t.co/zKqqU4k2ap \u2014 Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) October 21, 2019\n\nBut not all of her former 2016 supporters are amused by Clinton. Her last tweet prompted an expletive-laced argument between two of them over whether she should get out of the spotlight.\n\nFuck you. She literally tweeted a joke. And this is sad John because I truly never wanted to tell you Fuck You but you deserve it. \u2014 Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) October 20, 2019\n\nConservative show host Dan Bongino said Clinton was \u201cbreathlessly spouting ridiculous conspiracy theories\u201d:\n\nTrump broke Hillary. She\u2019s a shell of a human being now, breathlessly spouting ridiculous conspiracy theories to the few friends she has left. She is an awful, horrible person, as those who had the unfortunate experience of working with her know.\n\nTrump broke Hillary.

The Oct. 16 event is billed as \u201cDinner and conversation at the home of Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\nThe contribution level was a minimum $15,000, according to the invite posted online.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019s @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appears to still be coming to grips with her 2016 loss to Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Hillary-Clinton-Coming-to-Grips-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
