Walsh", "language": "en", "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 bluebird bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: BLUE) today announced that Jeffrey T. Walsh, chief strategy officer, has decided to transition from his current role effective January 6, 2020.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of bluebird, we are grateful for all that Jeff has accomplished over the past eight years in a variety of roles to advance our growth and operational strategies, and for his deep commitment to our patients, people and culture,\u201d said Nick Leschly, chief bluebird. \u201cJeff has left his mark on all of us as a valued leader, coach, and mentor and, personally, I will miss his partnership. His enormous contributions to bluebird have a very special place in our history and will continue to guide us well into the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy time with bluebird has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my career,\u201d said Jeff Walsh. \u201cThe opportunity to help lead the growth of our company from a fledgling start-up to a leader in gene therapy that is now ready to deliver transformative therapies to patients, is not something that everyone has the great fortune to do. While this was a very difficult decision, I\u2019m incredibly proud of our accomplishments and this team has shown me what it means to break through barriers in a serious way to help patients and each other. I\u2019ll always fly high as a proud member of the bluebird extended family, and fondly remember all of the fun we had along the way as we never took ourselves too seriously.\u201d\n\nJeff has not only built a strong foundation for bluebird\u2019s overall growth strategy but also leaves an experienced and passionate team. Both Chip Baird, chief financial officer, and Joanne Smith-Farrell, chief business officer, will assume broader corporate development and strategic responsibilities as bluebird continues to deliver on its mission for patients.\n\nAbout bluebird bio, Inc.\n\nbluebird bio is pioneering gene therapy with purpose. From our Cambridge, Mass., headquarters, we\u2019re developing gene therapies for severe genetic diseases and cancer, with the goal that people facing potentially fatal conditions with limited treatment options can live their lives fully. Beyond our labs, we\u2019re working to positively disrupt the healthcare system to create access, transparency and education so that gene therapy can become available to all those who can benefit.\n\nbluebird bio is a human company powered by human stories. We\u2019re putting our care and expertise to work across a spectrum of disorders by researching cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, sickle cell disease, transfusion-dependent \u03b2-thalassemia and multiple myeloma using three gene therapy technologies: gene addition, cell therapy and (megaTAL-enabled) gene editing.\n\nbluebird bio has additional nests in Seattle, Wash.; Durham, N.C.; and Zug, Switzerland.
