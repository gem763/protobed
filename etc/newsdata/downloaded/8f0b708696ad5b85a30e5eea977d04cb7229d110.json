Netflix (O: ) rose 9.9% in after-hours trade after its earnings beat Wall Street estimates.\n\nIn the currency market, soft U.S. retail sales took the shine out of the dollar.\n\nThe ( ) fell 0.30% on Wednesday and last stood at 97.964, having touched its lowest since Aug. 27.\n\nAgainst the yen the dollar slipped to 108.73 yen , after peaking at 108.90 on Tuesday.\n\nThe euro stood at $1.1075 ( ), up 0.04% so far in Asia, near a one-month high of $1.1085 hit in U.S. trade on Wednesday.\n\nSterling traded at $1.2823 , having risen to as high as $1.2877 on Wednesday, its loftiest level since mid-May.\n\nIt has risen more than 5% in the past five sessions on the prospect that the United Kingdom and the European Union can strike a fresh deal to avoid a no-deal exit in the summit on Thursday and Friday.\n\nInvestors have welcomed optimistic comments from key officials during last few days. British culture minister Nicky Morgan said late on Wednesday there is a good chance of a deal.\n\nStill, many doubts remained, not the least of which is if British Prime Minister Boris Johnson can ensure his government and factious parliament approve the plan.\n\nIn one sign of investor caution, in currency option markets, risk reversal spreads in sterling turned in favour of pound puts after briefly favouring pound calls earlier this week, meaning demand to protect the currency's downside is stronger than that for the upside.\n\nThe Turkish lira steadied off seven-week lows as U.S. President Donald Trump's sanctions for Turkey's military incursion into Syria were perceived to be lighter than expected.\n\nLira bears also suffered a flashback of their suffocating March squeeze as the authorities moved to keep a lid on volatility by restricting the supply of lira to overseas counterparts.\n\nThe lira stood at 5.8825 per dollar\n\nOil prices eased after U.S. data showed a larger-than-expected build in U.S. crude stocks.\n\nBrent crude ( ) futures fell 0.82% to $58.93 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude ( ) lost 1.01% to $52.82 per barrel.", "description": "Global shares lose steam on weak U.S. retail sales, Brexit in focus", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9G02B_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
