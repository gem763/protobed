I\u2019ve beaten Death Stranding, and I can\u2019t tell you anything about it other than to say this is a great trailer, but consider not watching it.\n\nSeriously. Maybe don\u2019t watch this. Death Stranding is long and weird and cryptic. This trailer takes moments from its major story beats and displays them to you out of context. They\u2019re not exactly spoilers, but they\u2019re not exact not spoilers.\n\nIf you\u2019re already sold on Death Stranding, then don\u2019t watch this trailer. If you\u2019re on the fence, take a gander. You might see something that lets you know what you\u2019re in for.", "description": "Sony just dropped a story trailer that lays out what the game\u2019s about.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db9adcb625ce0008d41eed6/lede/1572450184869-fszerakkfp7uvy58mxvd.png?crop=1xw:0.953601108033241xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
