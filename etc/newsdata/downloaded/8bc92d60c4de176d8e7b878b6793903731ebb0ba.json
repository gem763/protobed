Assad\u2019s forces are exploiting the U.S. retreat to seize back resource-rich territory they abandoned years ago.\n\nThe area includes most of the Syrian lands that formed the \u201ccaliphate\u201d of the Islamic State group, whose fighters have gone underground but vowed to stage a comeback.\n\nMore than 10,000 Islamic State prisoners, including many hardened foreign jihadis whose Western governments refuse to take them back, are in prisons there, and tens of thousands of their family members are in camps.\n\nHere is a summary of what the U.S. withdrawal means for those rushing in and those left behind.\n\nWHAT IS THE AIM OF TURKEY\u2019S OFFENSIVE?\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan says he wants to settle up to two million Syrian refugees, many of them of them Sunni Arabs, into the region targeted in the operation, territory which is currently controlled by Kurdish-led forces.\n\nTurkish troops and Ankara-backed Syrian rebels have focused in the first week of operations on driving Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters from two major border towns, Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain, about 120 km (75 miles) apart.\n\nDespite a chorus of global criticism, Erdogan has said nothing will stop operations against Kurdish YPG fighters, considered terrorists by Ankara because of their links to guerrillas waging an insurgency in southeast Turkey.\n\nErdogan has said Turkey will seize a border strip running hundreds of km (miles) from Kobani in the west to Hasaka in the east and 30-35 km (18 to 22 miles) deep inside Syria.\n\nA Turkish official told Reuters the operation was proceeding \u201cquite rapidly and successfully\u201d. The first phase would be complete by Nov. 13, when Erdogan is due to meet Trump during a visit to Washington, he said, without specifying how far Turkey would have gone by then.\n\nWHAT ARE ASSAD\u2019S GOALS?\n\nThe full withdrawal of U.S. forces and deployment of the Syrian army is a major juncture in the Syrian conflict, restoring a foothold for Assad\u2019s government across the biggest swath of the country that had been outside its grasp.\n\nThe area includes oil, farmland, water resources and the hydro-electric dam at Tabqa - vital assets that will better position the government to cope with the impact of Western sanctions.\n\nSyrian state media have said troops have reached the M4 highway that runs east-west around 30 km (18 miles) south of the frontier with Turkey, on the edge of Ankara\u2019s planned \u201csafe zone\u201d. On Tuesday they entered Manbij, in an area that had been patrolled jointly by Turkey and the United States.\n\nAssad\u2019s army, however, has been weakened by the attrition of prolonged conflict, and now relies heavily on Russia, Iran and Iran\u2019s Shi\u2019ite militia allies including Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah.\n\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR KURDISH AUTONOMY?\n\nSyria\u2019s Kurdish groups exploited the withdrawal of government forces from the northeast at the start of the Syrian conflict to build up the institutions of autonomy and teach Kurdish language in local schools.\n\nExposed to Turkish attack by the U.S. withdrawal, they invited the Syrian army back - a decision that highlighted their weakness and signalled an end to many of their dreams.\n\nThey will hope to preserve as much of their autonomy as possible in political talks with the Syrian state - their long declared objective. But they no longer have a powerful ally to back them.\n\nStill, Damascus and the SDF share the objective of driving Turkey from northern Syria, or at least halting its advance.\n\n\u201cDamascus needs the Kurds. The Kurds and Damascus have two things in common: enmity for Turkey and a desire not to see Sunni rebel militias ruling the northeast of Syria,\u201d said Joshua Landis, head of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cBut they don\u2019t agree on anything when it comes to ruling northeast Syria.\u201d\n\nWHAT WILL BECOME OF ISLAMIC STATE?\n\nThe Kurdish-led SDF was the main force on the ground in the U.S.-backed offensive that recaptured the Syrian lands of Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed caliphate, including the group\u2019s de facto capital Raqqa. Before its pullout, Washington had been preparing to train and equip an SDF force to stabilise the area, to prevent a return by the militants, who carried out large massacres of Kurds in towns they had controlled.\n\nThe SDF says the Turkish offensive has helped energise Islamic State sleeper cells, just a year after the \u201ccaliphate\u201d was effectively dismantled. Islamic State has already claimed responsibility for attacks, including a deadly car bomb strike outside a restaurant in the biggest Kurdish city Qamishli just a day after Turkey launched its incursion.\n\nSince the fighting started last week, the SDF says there has also been unrest in the prisons where they are holding the fighters, and in camps holding their wives and children.\n\nPOTENTIAL IRANIAN WIN\n\nAssad\u2019s ally Iran is also set to gain. Iraqi paramilitary groups backed by Iran on the Iraq-Syria border will likely help Assad secure control, strengthening their own supply lines along a corridor of territory from Tehran to Beirut.\n\nWHAT DOES RUSSIA WANT?\n\nRussia\u2019s indispensable role in Syria reflects a larger shift in the Middle East from Damascus to Riyadh, as showcased by President Vladimir Putin\u2019s Gulf tour this week, including his first visit to Saudi Arabia in more than a decade.\n\nIt was Russia\u2019s intervention with air power in 2015 which helped turn the tide of Syria\u2019s civil war in Assad\u2019s favour, and Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the northeast has cemented Moscow\u2019s central role in shaping the country\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cThere are Turkish-Russian talks ... to set the tempo for northern Syria, particularly east of the Euphrates,\u201d said a regional pro-Damascus source. \u201cThey are the ones moving all these plans.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Turkey-backed Syrian rebel fighters take pictures with mobile phones at the border town of Tel Abyad, Syria, October 14, 2019. REUTERS/Khalil Ashawi/File Photo\n\nThe Turkish official said Ankara is \u201cworking in very close cooperation with Russia\u201d, and Erdogan pointed on Monday to Russia\u2019s importance when he said that President Vladimir Putin had shown a \u201cpositive approach\u201d to the situation.\n\nThe two countries may be able to forge an agreement dividing the northern border into new control zones and prevent their local allies - the Syrian government on the one hand and anti-Assad insurgents on the other - from going to war.\n\n\u201cI think there will be real friction but I do think the Russians will be able to manage it. There is a deal to be made,\u201d said Joshua Landis, an expert on Syria and head of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma.", "description": "President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of Syria radically realigns the balance of power in the country's northeast and creates a vacuum which Russia, Turkey and Iran are racing to fill.", "authors": ["Dominic Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441197367&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1NS", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
