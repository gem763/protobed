Historical and Architectural Preservation official Eric Holcomb told the newspaper a museum expressed interest in the bronze statues but they were too large. He says the commission is looking for any organization that\u2019ll provide a \u201chistorically accurate interpretation\u201d of them.\n\nFormer Mayor Catherine Pugh ordered the monuments taken down following violent clashes over similar statues in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nSince then, suggestions have ranged from destroying them, to adding contextual markers, to melting them and turning them into statues of civil rights figures.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Baltimore Sun, http://www.baltimoresun.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Baltimore official says the city is still looking for an organization that wants to acquire the Confederate monuments it removed in the middle of the night two years ago.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
