The unfortunate incidents in the game were handled as well as possible & proud of how we handled it \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc65\udb40\udc6e\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc7f pic.twitter.com/ai1Cn2ZJYI \u2014 Tyrone Mings (@OfficialTM_3) October 14, 2019\n\nHe responded with the mental strength which has helped shape an unconventional career.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anything could spoil this moment for me personally. It\u2019s obviously disappointing,\u201d he said defiantly post-match.\n\nMings had appeared equally unfazed at the time of the abuse, drawing it to the attention of one of the referee\u2019s assistants by questioning, \u2018hey, did you hear that?\u2019, and calmly alerting captain Harry Kane to the situation.\n\nDisplays of resilience are nothing new from the Aston Villa player.\n\nTyrone Mings spoke with match officials about the racial abuse which marred England\u00b4s Euro 2020 qualifier with Bulgaria (/PA)\n\nHis challenging pathway to an England cap has included various character-building setbacks such as teenage rejection and serious injuries.\n\nLess than seven years ago, Bath-born Mings was in danger of slipping through the net.\n\nHe was playing for Wiltshire-based club Chippenham and working as a mortgage broker following a spell with another non-league side, Yate Town.\n\nThose moves came after he was released by Southampton at the age of 16 and secured a football scholarship at Millfield School, a private boarding school in Somerset known for developing young athletes.\n\n\"He's playing regularly. He will see the game as a good opportunity. He's a good talker and he's impressed us with the way he organises others. He's got good athleticism and I think he will relish the occasion\"\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udde3 Gareth Southgate on @OfficialTM_3 #AVFC #ThreeLions pic.twitter.com/dfANo4Wsag \u2014 Aston Villa (@AVFCOfficial) October 14, 2019\n\nIt was current Republic of Ireland manager Mick McCarthy who eventually took a chance on him, paying \u00a310,000 to take him from Chippenham to Ipswich in December 2012.\n\nMings \u2013 then aged 19 \u2013 used the opportunity to demonstrate a tenacious attitude which would later help take him all the way to the top of the sport.\n\n\u201cThis is for everyone who laughed when I said I wanted to be a footballer or said I wouldn\u2019t make it,\u201d he tweeted after signing an 18-month contract with the Tractor Boys.\n\nIn three seasons at Portman Road, Mings more than justified McCarthy\u2019s faith and made 57 appearances to earn an \u00a38million move to Premier League new boys Bournemouth.\n\nTyrone Mings was injured on his Premier League debut for Bournemouth (Andrew Matthews/PA)\n\nHowever, his dramatic upward curve was soon halted. A frustrating four years on the south coast were blighted by injury and a lengthy \u2013 and untimely \u2013 ban.\n\nMings suffered a serious knee problem on his Premier League debut against Leicester in August 2015 and had his resolve severely tested by almost 16 months on the sidelines.\n\nIn March 2017, his bid to regain fitness was subsequently curtailed by a clash with then-Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic which left him suspended for five matches for an alleged stamp.\n\nMings did not feature again that season, managed just nine more top-flight outings for the Cherries and only 10 league starts in total, partly due to a long-term back issue.\n\nWith his career floundering, a deadline-day move to Villa Park in January provided a lifeline.\n\nDropping back to the Championship where he initially made his name, 6ft 5in Mings became a towering rock at the heart of Dean Smith\u2019s defence, helping the west midlands club return to the Premier League via the play-offs.\n\nThe successful loan switch was made permanent for an initial fee believed to be \u00a320million and he has been ever-present in the top-flight this term attracting the attention of England boss Southgate with a series of assured performances.\n\nMings\u2019 international debut also owed a lot to the poor form of Michael Keane, the injury problems of John Stones, and the current international exile of Kyle Walker.\n\nHis mature display in the Bulgarian capital suggests he possesses both the talent and the temperament to seize the opening.", "description": "The 26-year-old suffered vile taunts from the terraces in Sofia.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/13/wire-19739300-1571141632-138_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
