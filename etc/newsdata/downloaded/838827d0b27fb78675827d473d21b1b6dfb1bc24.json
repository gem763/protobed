Season the pork belly with salt, pepper, and ancho chile powder.\n\nScatter chiles in a large roasting pan and place the pork belly on top of the chiles, skin side down. Drizzle 1/2 cup of agave on top of the pork belly.\n\nDilute the remaining agave by whisking into chicken stock or water.\n\nAdd agave liquid to the roasting pan. Cover tightly with lid or aluminum foil and roast for 2 hours, basting pork with pan juices every 30 minutes.\n\nTurn pork belly over and continue roasting until it is fork tender, about 2 more hours.\n\nTransfer pork to a deep tray or plate, reserving the pan juices, and set it aside to cool. Once pork has cooled, cover it with parchment or waxed paper. Place a large plate over the covered pork belly and weigh it down with heavy cans or a foil-wrapped brick. Refrigerate pork this way overnight.\n\nStrain the liquid from the roasting pan into a saucepan, reserving the chiles.\n\nSimmer the sauce for about 30 to 45 minutes until it is reduced to about 1 cup. Add reserved chiles and remove thickened sauce from the heat. Set aside to let the glaze cool, then place in the refrigerator to chill.\n\nWhen you are ready to serve the dish, remove pork belly from refrigerator.
