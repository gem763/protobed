Lawmakers will get their chance to press the Defense Department on the issue Tuesday at the confirmation hearing of Dana Deasy, the agency\u2019s chief information officer.\n\nAD\n\nIn its announcement, the Pentagon said all bidders had been treated \u201cfairly and consistently,\u201d pointing out that the procurement strategy had already gone through two bid protests and a lawsuit.\n\nAD\n\nDeasy said there is an urgent need to move forward with the contract.\n\n\u201cThe National Defense Strategy dictates that we must improve the speed and effectiveness with which we develop and deploy modernized technical capabilities to our women and men in uniform,\u201d Deasy said in a statement. \u201cThe DOD Digital Modernization Strategy was created to support this imperative. This award is an important step in execution of the Digital Modernization Strategy.\u201d\n\nThe Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure contract, known as JEDI, is meant to simplify the Pentagon\u2019s computing systems under a commercially operated cloud computing infrastructure, in which agencies can rent computing services from specialized providers. Military officials say they need access to such a system to modernize the military\u2019s disparate computing systems and take advantage of next-generation artificial-intelligence tools.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmazon Web Services, which pioneered this approach in the business world, had long been seen as a front-runner for the JEDI contract. It already has several years of experience managing classified data for the CIA under the terms of an earlier $600 million contract. And it is also the only company that holds the highest-level Defense Department information-technology certification. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nLooming over the procurement is a direct intervention by President Trump, who asked Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper to review the contract based on concerns that it would go to Amazon, people familiar with the matter told The Post in late August. Trump has spoken out against Amazon and Bezos on multiple occasions. He has attacked The Post for its coverage of him, conflating the newspaper with Amazon\u2019s interests, accusing it of publishing \u201cfake news\u201d and operating as a \u201clobbyist newspaper\u201d for the company.\n\nTrump\u2019s intervention prompted Esper to initiate his own review of the Defense Department\u2019s winner-take-all approach in early September. That review culminated in an Oct. 22 announcement that Esper would recuse himself from any decisions on the JEDI contract because his son works for IBM, one of the initial bidders. Days later, it was announced that the contract would go to Microsoft.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) has already criticized Trump for interfering in the bidding process, tweeting in August that the president\u2019s use of his office to punish media critics \u201cwould be a complete abuse of power.\u201d\n\nAmazon has not commented on how it will proceed.\n\nIf Amazon wants to stay in the running for the JEDI contract, it will need to protest the award to Microsoft. There are a few steps the company would need to take to do that.\n\nFirst, Amazon can ask for a debriefing from the Defense Department to understand the agency\u2019s rationale for awarding the contract to Microsoft. Amazon declined to say whether it will ask for that debriefing.\n\nAlan Chvotkin, executive vice president and counsel for the Professional Services Council, a trade group for government contractors, said he thought it would be in Amazon\u2019s interest to request what is called an \u201cenhanced debriefing\u201d with Pentagon officials in charge of the procurement. Such an action could put an automatic stay on the procurement while more information is gathered.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt may all be aboveboard, but there\u2019s going to need to be an inquiry into how they handled the procurement,\u201d Chvotkin said. \u201cWhat were the briefings that Esper was provided during his review? Why did he recuse himself? It raises a lot of questions.\u201d\n\nThen Amazon has two avenues to legally challenge the award. It could formally protest the award with the Government Accountability Office. A year ago, the GAO chimed in on the JEDI contracting process, ruling against a bid protest filed by Amazon rival Oracle, which challenged the Defense Department decision to go to a single company for the lucrative contract. The second option is Amazon could file a lawsuit over the contract award.\n\nAD", "description": "With Amazon mulling whether to protest, the last-minute-recusal from Defense Secretary Mark Esper further complicates a procurement that is already fraught with controversy.", "authors": ["Aaron Gregg", "Reporter Covering The Defense Industry", "Commercial Aviation", "Government Contractors.", "Jay Greene", "Reporter Focused On Technology Coverage In The Pacific Northwest"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XKcn8RO6uA6RuP4IDBmc0NSWnfo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QISFWNXZWAI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
