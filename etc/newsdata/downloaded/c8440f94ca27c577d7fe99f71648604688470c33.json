The pros and cons", "language": "en", "text": "A cash-out refinance replaces your existing mortgage with a new home loan for more than you owe on your house. The difference goes to you in cash and you can spend it on home improvements, debt consolidation or other financial needs. You must have equity built up in your house to use a cash-out refinance.\n\nTraditional refinancing, in contrast, replaces your existing mortgage with a new one for the same balance. Here\u2019s how a cash-out refinance works:\n\nPays you the difference between the mortgage balance and the home\u2019s value.\n\nHas slightly higher interest rates due to a higher loan amount.\n\nLimits cash-out amounts to 80% to 90% of your home\u2019s equity.\n\nIn other words, you can\u2019t pull out 100% of your home\u2019s equity. If your home is valued at $200,000 and your mortgage balance is $100,000, you have $100,000 of equity in your home. You can refinance your $100,000 loan balance for $150,000, and receive $50,000 in cash at closing to pay for renovations.\n\nPros of a cash-out refinance\n\nLower interest rates: A mortgage refinance typically offers a lower interest rate than a home equity line of credit, or HELOC, or a home-equity loan.\n\nSee: Mortgage rates drop once again \u2014 sparking more interest in loan refinancing\n\nA cash-out refinance might give you a lower interest rate if you originally bought your home when mortgage rates were much higher. For example, if you bought in 2000, the average mortgage rate was about 9%. Today, it\u2019s considerably lower. But if you only want to lock in a lower interest rate on your mortgage and don\u2019t need the cash, regular refinancing makes more sense.\n\nDebt consolidation: Using the money from a cash-out refinance to pay off high-interest credit cards could save you thousands of dollars in interest.\n\nHigher credit score: Paying off your credit cards in full with a cash-out refinance can build your credit score by reducing your credit utilization ratio, the amount of available credit you\u2019re using.\n\nTax deductions: The mortgage interest deduction may be available on a cash-out refinance if the money is used to buy, build or substantially improve your home.\n\nCons of a cash-out refi\n\nForeclosure risk: Because your home is the collateral for any kind of mortgage, you risk losing it if you can\u2019t make the payments. If you\u2019re doing a cash-out refinance to pay off credit card debt, you\u2019re paying off unsecured debt with secured debt, a move that\u2019s generally frowned upon because of the possibility of losing your home.\n\nNew terms: Your new mortgage will have different terms from your original loan. Double-check your interest rate and fees before you agree to the new terms.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Realtor\u2019s property listing blew up on Zillow, and you\u2019ll \u2018Scream\u2019 when you see why\n\nClosing costs: You\u2019ll pay closing costs for a cash-out refinance, as you would with any refinance. Closing costs are typically 2% to 5% of the mortgage \u2014 that\u2019s $4,000 to $10,000 for a $200,000 loan. Make sure your potential savings are worth the cost.\n\nPrivate mortgage insurance: If you borrow more than 80% of your home\u2019s value, you\u2019ll have to pay for private mortgage insurance. For example, if your home is valued at $200,000 and you refinance for more than $160,000, you\u2019ll probably have to pay PMI. Private mortgage insurance typically costs from 0.55% to 2.25% of your loan amount each year. PMI of 1% on a $180,000 mortgage would cost $1,800 a year.\n\nEnabling bad habits: Using a cash-out refi to pay off your credit cards can backfire if you succumb to temptation and run up your credit card balances again.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nA cash-out refinance can make sense if you can get a good interest rate on the new loan and have a sound use for the money. But seeking a refinance to fund vacations or a new car isn\u2019t a good idea, because you\u2019ll have little to no return on your money. On the other hand, using the money to fund a home renovation can rebuild the equity you\u2019re taking out; using it to consolidate debt can put you on a sounder financial footing.\n\nAlso read: Why buying and selling a house could soon be as simple as trading stocks\n\nYou\u2019re using your home as collateral for a cash-out refinance, so it\u2019s important to make payments on your new loan on time and in full.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "A cash-out refi makes sense\u2014in some circumstances.
