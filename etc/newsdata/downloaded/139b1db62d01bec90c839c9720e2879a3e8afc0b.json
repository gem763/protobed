Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a small improvement of 0.2% growth.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade row has weighed on Germany's manufacturing and export-heavy economy throughout the year. But the latest figures also showed that domestic demand had weakened, falling 2.6%, while international orders climbed slightly, by 0.9%.\n\nYields on German 10-year bunds ticked lower to -0.593%. Yields on bonds fall as prices rise.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.2%, while Korea's Kospi edged up 0.1%.\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He is expected to resume discussions with U.S. counterparts later this week.\n\nLee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG, said there had been a number of reports that China may not as willing to compromise as much as the Trump administration hopes.\n\n\"The U.S. would like a trade deal with China, a wide-ranging deal, but those demands look like they're unlikely to be accepted by China. Things like intellectual property rights and other structural issues like state subsidies look unlikely to be resolved,\" he said. \"China may buy more agricultural goods but it's unclear whether or not that partial agreement will be a big enough win for the U.S.\"\n\nThe Chinese offshore yuan was down 0.23% against the dollar, a move some analysts said reflected worsening prospects of breakthrough in trade relations with the U.S. The offshore yuan could reach a new low if there isn't resolution in trade talks by the end of the year, according to MUFG analysts.\n\nIn commodities, global oil benchmark Brent crude edged up 0.1%, and haven asset gold slipped 0.2%.\n\nThe yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury rose to 1.522% on Monday, from 1.515% on Friday.\n\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the currency against a basket of its peers, inched up 0.1%.\n\nWrite to Anna Isaac at anna.isaac@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 07, 2019 04:38 ET (08:38 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
