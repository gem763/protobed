Avisail Garcia hit a two-run drive in the second, and Morton had all the support he needed as Tampa Bay advanced to face the AL West champion Astros in a best-of-five Division Series after Houston won a major league-best 107 games this season.\n\nTommy Pham homered in the fifth for the 96-win Rays, who had the smallest payroll in the majors at $66.4 million US. They were unfazed by the towel-swirling Oakland home crowd of 54,005 that established a wild-card record, having recently played at Dodger Stadium and also on the road against the Yankees and Red Sox in the season's final two weeks.\n\nThe Rays raced out of their dugout to celebrate when Marcus Semien struck out to end it, and then started putting on fresh playoff T-shirts and caps.\n\n\"It's a beautiful thing having the lowest payroll in baseball and having the success we did,\" Rays centre fielder Kevin Kiermaier said before the game. \"It always feels good to stick it to the man any time you're able to in this game, and that's something to be very proud of.\"\n\nThe A's have lost nine straight winner-take-all games since 2000, going 1-15 with a chance to advance to the next round. Their only win was in 2006 against the Twins before being swept in the AL Championship Series by the Tigers.\n\nA year ago in the wild-card game, Oakland's first time back in the playoffs since 2014, the A's fell behind fast and lost 7-2 at Yankee Stadium. They won 97 games again to earn a wild card.\n\nThis game had a far different feel in the familiar, friendly confines of the Coliseum, but the A's dug themselves another quick hole.\n\nAnd the visitors were the ones putting on a happy home run show this time. Oakland, which hit a franchise-record 257 homers, is 0-6 in winner-take-all playoff games at home since 2000.\n\nEven a day earlier, Rays manager Kevin Cash wasn't sure Diaz would play given how much time he missed with a foot injury.\n\n\"He probably caught us off guard a little bit with how quickly he turned around over the last five, six days,\" Cash said.\n\nDiaz returned for the season's final game at Toronto after being sidelined since July 23. He played in just 79 games this season, 22 of those at first with 17 starts\n\nHe's someone Kiermaier notes is \"just one of those guys, he just wakes up out of bed and rakes. Everyone knows him for his muscles and what he can do in the weight room and stuff like that, but the guy finds the barrel so much throughout this whole season, and any time we're able to have him available, we're happy.\"", "description": "Yandy Diaz slugged baseball's lowest spender into a matchup with mighty Houston, Charlie Morton silenced the powerful Athletics on the mound, and the Tampa Bay Rays beat Oakland at its own game 5-1 in the AL wild-card round Wednesday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5306981.1570074540!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/rays-athletics-baseball.jpg"}
