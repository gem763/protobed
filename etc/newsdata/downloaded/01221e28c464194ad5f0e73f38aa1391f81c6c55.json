To be punished for following the law is, in my opinion, seriously out of order, and my son was thirsty as a result.\u201d\n\nWhen approached about the incident a Wetherspoon spokesperson suggested the outcome was a little different.\n\n(Image: Cambridge News)\n\nIan became \"instantly defensive\" when the manager came over, the spokesperson claimed.\n\n\u201cThe manager tried to explain the rules and policy on the matter but the gentleman wouldn\u2019t listen,\" they said.\n\n\"When the son was asked for ID, his father told the manager that his son didn\u2019t need ID for the drink.\n\n\u201cThe gentleman grabbed the drink and handed it to his son, telling him to drink it as they were leaving the pub.\n\n\u201cThe manager reached out and tried to grab the drink, but the man moved his arm away and dropped the drink onto the floor, shouting there had been an assault and that he would be reporting the manager to the police.\n\n\u201cWetherspoon stands 100 per cent with the pub\u2019s manager and the company is more than happy to hand over CCTV to the police to show the entire incident on film.\n\n\u201cThe gentlemen is now barred from the pub.\u201d\n\nThen informed of Wetherspoons' decision to bar him from the pub, Ian said he wasn't aware.\n\nHe added that he \"couldn't care less\" and that he has other places to go to drink.", "description": "Ian Richardson is no longer allowed to drink at The Regal in Cambridgeshire where he bought his son a strawberry and lime Kopparberg", "authors": ["Harry Gold", "Milo Boyd", "Image", "Cambridge News", "David Johnson"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20587027.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Ian-Richardsonjpgs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
