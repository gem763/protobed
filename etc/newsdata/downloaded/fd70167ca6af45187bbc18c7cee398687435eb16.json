But in addition to hardware announcements, the company also announced new privacy updates for existing products, coming on the heels of a number of recent scandals.\n\nAmazon has refined its \u201cwake word\u201d software, the feature that is used to command the personal assistant software Alexa, to make it 50% more accurate and decrease the likelihood customers inadvertently record themselves. The company will also provide a mute button that electronically disconnects microphones from Echo, and will give readers the option to opt out of recording or delete audio recordings after a certain amount of time.\n\nAmazon will also introduce a new privacy feature for the smart doorbells of its subsidiary Ring called \u201cHome Mode\u201d, which will prevent the doorbell cameras from recording footage when residents are home. Earlier this year, Amazon rolled out \u201cprivacy zones\u201d which exclude selected areas in Ring\u2019s field of vision from being recorded or viewed live.\n\nAmazon staff listen to customers' Alexa recordings, report says Read more\n\nThe changes come as Amazon has faced scrutiny for recording customer conversations through Alexa and its public-private partnership with police forces through the smart doorbell company.\n\n\u201cPrivacy cannot be an afterthought when it comes to the devices and services we offer our customers,\u201d Dave Limp, senior vice-president of devices, said at the Seattle event. \u201cIt has to be foundational and built in from the beginning for every piece of hardware, software, and service that we create.\u201d\n\nAmazon faced criticism in April when Bloomberg reported that Amazon employees listen to Alexa voice archives to train its artificial intelligence. Amazon previously kept a copy of all audio Alexa records after hearing its name prompt it to listen.\n\nNow, customers have the ability to instruct Alexa to \u201cdelete everything I said today\u201d or \u201cdelete what I just said\u201d.\n\nAnd news investigations into Ring\u2019s expanding partnerships with police forces across the US have revealed that the company has partnered with more than 465 law enforcement agencies, raising privacy concerns and civil rights issues.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Amazon\u2019s new eyeglasses, which come with its virtual assistant Alexa.

Many have also expressed concern regarding the disproportionate effects surveillance can have on people of color.\n\n\u201cWe want to ensure that customers have the control with the cameras they have,\u201d Limp said in Seattle.\n\nThe changes are becoming more pressing as Amazon seeks to expand into every aspect of consumer lives, analysts say, with acquisitions in new spaces and Alexa integrating into a larger variety of devices.\n\n\u201cThe enormous breadth of new features shows that ubiquity also comes with complexity,\u201d Geoff Blaber, vice-president of research at the market analysis firm CCS Insight, said. \u201cAs Alexa gets integrated more deeply into an ever-expanding range of devices and appliances, the challenge for Amazon will be managing that complexity.\u201d", "description": "New products include earbuds, eyeglasses and smart oven alongside privacy improvements following a series of scandals", "authors": ["Kari Paul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66a1a5e3930dd5daee968b8490814fe0e2d005c8/0_294_4408_2645/master/4408.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a84c1f4a9d2e173cc60ce58179d76e9e", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
