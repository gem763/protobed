REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\n\nThe 130-year-old confectioner finds itself at the sharp end of a rush by British retailers to stockpile ahead of Christmas, with a divorce deal between Britain and the European Union still elusive barely two weeks before an Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nChief Executive Roland Gibert, who counts London\u2019s up-market department store Fortnum & Mason among his British buyers, has hired extra staff to meet the unexpected spike in deliveries for its candied fruits, glazed chestnuts and fruit jellies.\n\n\u201cSome of our British clients have been very insistent on delivery before October 31,\u201d Gibert said as workers poured fruit syrups from copper vats for cooling and hand-sorted candied red chili peppers destined for a British chocolatier.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having to deliver 30% of our exports to Britain ahead of time. That complicates production, our production lines are flat out.\u201d\n\nTight deadlines have meant unforeseen night shifts, stretching costs further. The alternative, though, is to risk losing contracts that have helped Gibert double the company\u2019s exports since he bought it a decade ago.\n\nExports account for some 15% of Cruzilles\u2019s annual 9.5 million euros ($10.5 million) turnover. A third of those go to Britain.\n\nWith Brexit negotiations facing an unpredictable endgame, British retailers and their foreign suppliers have had to restructure operations in case of a chaotic no-deal outcome.\n\nNo deal would mean an end to frictionless trade between Britain and the EU, the world\u2019s largest free trade bloc, with the arrival of customs checks threatening to shatter just-in-time supply chains, clog ports and delay deliveries.[nL5N26W4QR]\n\nFINANCIAL PRICE\n\nA survey by the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS) showed one in five British businesses are importing Christmas stock early to avoid possible border disruption.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the worst time of year (for retailers),\u201d said CIPS economist John Glen.\n\nCruzilles generates two-thirds of its annual revenues in the final four months of the year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to pay a financial price this year,\u201d Gibert said. \u201cThat\u2019s for sure, because we\u2019ve had to produce more during our most intense period. And it\u2019s always at that point when your marginal costs are at their highest,\u201d he added, saying he couldn\u2019t yet quantify the additional costs.\n\nIt is not just the advanced orders that trouble Gibert, but also the wild swings in Britain\u2019s sterling currency and the possible return to customs formalities and trade tariffs.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nBritain\u2019s membership of the single market has meant the paperwork for supplying Fortnum & Mason in London has been no more complex than delivering to high-end buyers such as Galeries Lafayette and Casino-owned Monoprix (CASP.PA) in Paris.\n\nCruzilles\u2019s British clients were being slow to commit to 2020 orders because of uncertainty over the shape of future British-EU trade ties, Gibert said.\n\n\u201cBritain has always been where we\u2019ve prioritised our business development efforts,\u201d Gibert said. \u201cBut for 2020 we said to ourselves let\u2019s focus elsewhere because with Britain we just don\u2019t know.\u201d", "description": "In the shadow of the Massif Central's extinct volcanoes, the production line at French glac\u00e9-fruit producer Cruzilles is working flat out to meet a glut of advanced orders from its number one export market: Britain.", "authors": ["Richard Lough", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441498169&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F19J", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
