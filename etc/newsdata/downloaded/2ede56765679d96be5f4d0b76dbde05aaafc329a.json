The bill has already passed the lower house of Congress and, if approved by the Senate, will go the President Jair Bolosonaro to be signed.\n\nThe law aims to encourage investment in broadband in remote areas of Brazil by allowing companies to own outright telecom assets, such as cellphone towers and valuable real estate, that they may sell if they so choose.\n\nPassage of PLC 79 is expected to unleash a wave of asset sales and benefit the entire Brazilian telecommunications industry, especially Oi SA, which is in bankruptcy protection and would become more attractive to a buyer.\n\nShares of Oi jumped 4% on news that the bill cleared the committee stage before drifting back down again on Sao Paulo's stock market, while Telefonica Brasil SA gained 1.1%.\n\nThe bill could also benefit Claro, the local subsidiary of Mexico's America Movil SAB de CV, and TIM Participa\u00e7\u00f5es SA, a subsidiary of Telecom Italia SpA .\n\nThe bill changes the current, more restricted model so that assets used under concessions would no longer revert to the government once a service provider's contract period expires. It also ends the requirement that providers invest in outdated technology such as public phones and landlines.\n\nBesides removing restrictions on asset sales, the new law would allow fixed-voice concessionaires to swap obligations they have under current concessions for investments in broadband assigned by telecoms regulator Anatel.\n\nIt is now up to Anatel to implement the changes, which could take 12 to 18 months. But the bill's passage reduces uncertainty about concessions and will speed up new investment decisions and sector consolidation, Itau BBA said in a research note to clients.\n\nThe committee postponed until next Wednesday a vote on another key bill that would lift a ban on cross-ownership between distributors and content producers in Brazil's paid TV sector.\n\nThe current law has prevented approval by Anatel of the $85 billion takeover of content group Time Warner Inc by AT&T Inc , which owns Sky Brasil, the country's largest satellite provider. The merger was approved in 2017 by Brazil\u2019s antitrust regulator CADE that allowed the companies to keep their assets in the country as long as they remain separate operations.
