I got one in the zone and I hit it out.\u201d\n\nNew York won their 12th consecutive playoff game against the Twins and can wrap up the best-of-five American League Division Series with a victory Monday in Minneapolis.\n\nTheir winning streak over the Twins, which is the longest over any opponent in the playoffs, dates back to 2004. They are 15-2 all-time against Minnesota in the postseason.\n\nGregorius\u2019 shot sailed into the upper deck in right field in front of a crowd of 49,200 at Yankee Stadium on Saturday. He fell behind in the count 0-2 against pitcher Tyler Duffey before connecting on a fastball that landed just inside the foul pole.\n\n\u201cI was trying not to chase it,\u201d said Gregorius.\n\nNew York led 3-0 when Gregorius came to bat in the third. It was his fourth career playoff homer and the Yankees 12th postseason grand slam and first since Robinson Cano hit one in game one of the 2011 ALDS against Detroit.\n\nAfter Gregorius homered, the Yankees added their eighth run when Brett Gardner hit an RBI single off Devin Smeltzer that scored DJ LeMahieu.\n\nYankees pitcher Masahiro Tanaka of Japan allowed one run on three hits in five innings. He struck out seven and walked one.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Didi Gregorius clubbed a grand slam home run to highlight a seven-run third inning as the New York Yankees took a 2-0", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/36a1ad_new-york-didi-gregorius-salutes-crowd-his-inning-grand-slam-home-run-helped-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
