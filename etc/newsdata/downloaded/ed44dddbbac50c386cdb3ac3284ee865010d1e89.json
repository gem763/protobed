The 28-year-old is assured as they come under the high ball, a towering presence with a safe pair of hands to match. His absence will surely enforce a change in tact from Warren Gatland, who may be less willing to adopt the aerial approach in exploiting the Springboks\u2019 backline and attempting to pin them back deep in their own territory.\n\nBut more than this, Wales have also lost a penetrative attacking edge from their midfield. Williams brings a creative spark to the Welsh backline that enables the side to break the game line, with the full-back exceptional in surging from deep, gliding past defenders and making vital gains on the front foot.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Williams has enjoyed a stellar 12 months on the pitch, securing the Grand Slam with Wales before later lifting the European and Premiership crowns with Saracens. The full-back has been in the form of his life, and there\u2019s no doubt he\u2019ll be sorely missed.\n\nBut with Leigh Halfpenny stepping into the fray, Wales can rest assured that they will not head into Sunday\u2019s match vulnerable. \u201cDefensively, he\u2019s the best full back in the world in his aerial game and coverage,\u201d Gatland said of the Scarlets player. \u201cIt is a change, but we don\u2019t think that we are weakening the side in any way with the changes we have made.\u201d\n\nThe Kiwi also revealed that serious consideration had been given to starting Halfpenny at 15 for the match anyway and moving Williams to the wing. \u201cWe had a long debate about whether we started Leigh in the first place and move Liam to the wing,\u201d said Gatland.\n\nHalfpenny\u2019s defensive qualities will undoubtedly strengthen Wales\u2019 hand when under pressure from the Springboks and the boot of Handre Pollard. The 30-year-old reads the game superbly, in anticipating the high ball and providing sweeping cover, and for all his size packs a punch in the air.\n\nHis point kicking brings another dimension to Sunday\u2019s match, though Gatland said Dan Biggar would continue to lead on this front. \u201cDan Biggar will be kicking,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was originally in the side so we\u2019ll continue to that. If anything comes at around 50 or 55 metres then Leigh will step up for that.\u201d\n\nIndeed, fans will remember the sight of Halfpenny\u2019s long-distance kick in the 2011 semi-final, one that would have secured victory, falling agonisingly short against the French. Perhaps, in a strange twist of fate, Sunday can offer the full-back the chane to make amends for such heartbreak.\n\nHowever, given Halfpenny\u2019s limitations on the counter-attack, the emphasis now falls on Jonathan Davies and Hadleigh Parkes to step up to the mark in making those puncturing runs through the channels \u2013 no easy feat when faced with Lukhanyo Am and Damian de Allende on the other side of the tape. Questions have lingered for a while over the creativity of the Welsh midfield, though Gatland\u2019s men will be able to draw confidence from that opening 20-minute spell against Australia last month when the backs were ruthlessly incisive.\n\nThey key, now, is making the most of Halfpenny in those spells of attacking verve and vim. As a player who started his international career on the wing, scoring seven tries in his first 13 Tests, the full-back remains a threatening force \u2013 just a different one to that of Williams.\n\nBut for all the drama of the past few days, with Josh Navidi another to be ruled out for the remainder of the World Cup, Gatland remains overwhelmingly optimistic of taking the Welsh to a first-ever final. \u201cI\u2019ll always believe something is possible,\u201d he added on Friday. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have that attitude and portray it, then it\u2019ll never happen.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably been a big part of the success. You have to have the desire and belief you can do something special.\u201d", "description": "On a wet and sodden Friday morning in Tokyo, it seemed only natural that the news coming out of the Welsh camp was as miserable in nature:\u00a0Liam Williams\u2019\u00a0Rugby World Cup\u00a0was over.
