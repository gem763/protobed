Cloudflare said in an updated filing on Wednesday that it \u201cmay have failed to comply with certain U.S. export-related filing and reporting requirements and may have submitted incorrect information to the U.S. government in connection with certain hardware exports.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe identified that our products were used by, or for the benefit of, certain individuals and entities included in OFAC\u2019s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (the SDN List), including entities identified in OFAC\u2019s counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics trafficking sanctions programs, or affiliated with governments currently subject to comprehensive U.S. sanctions,\u201d the company wrote in the filing.\n\nThe news of the disclosure was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, but the company was still able to price above its target range. We\u2019ll see how other investors feel about the company and its new valuation when it starts trading tomorrow.\n\nIllustration Credit: Li-Anne Dias", "description": "", "authors": ["Sophia Kunthara"], "top_image": "https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ipo_grey-1.gif"}
