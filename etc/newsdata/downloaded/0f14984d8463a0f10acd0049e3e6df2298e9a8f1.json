She's a fan of \"My Favorite Murder,\" the podcast that makes subversive fun of the obsession so many women, the hosts included, share for stories of murder and mayhem. One of the show's most popular catchphrases? \"Stay sexy and don't get murdered.\"\n\nWhen we told Katherine, a 23-year-old who works for Uber Eats, that we were setting her up with a man named Drew \u2014 no other details given \u2014 she decided to put her sleuthing skills to the test. She needed to stay sexy and not get murdered. That meant verifying that this Drew character wasn\u2019t a serial killer. She went searching for a Drew from D.C. online. Unsurprisingly, she failed to find him.\n\nShe came face-to-face with Drew Gilbertson, the 24-year-old software developer we set her up with, at Alta Strada, an Italian restaurant on K Street NW. The first impressions were positive. Drew said he thought Katherine was \u201cvery pretty\u201d; Katherine thought Drew was \u201cvery cute.\u201d Drew was impressed that Katherine took charge of the conversation early on, while he was still feeling nervous. \u201cI\u2019m used to going on these things and having to carry the conversation,\u201d he said. He doesn\u2019t generally mind doing it, but in this case, \u201cnot having to do that was really cool and really nice.\u201d\n\nEarly on in the date, Katherine said something \u2014 neither of them can remember what it was, just that it was very deadpan, and very much his sense of humor \u2014 that caught him off guard, and when he realized she was kidding, he visibly relaxed.\n\nFaced with a man who, in person, did not seem like a serial killer, Katherine came clean about her attempted background check on him. Laughing at her hubris, she told him: \u201cI tried to find you on LinkedIn.\u201d Drew, she recalled, told her: \u201cIf I was trying to murder you, I wouldn\u2019t put it on my LinkedIn!\u201d To which she said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe you\u2019re a serial killer who wants to network with other serial killers!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt snowballed into this not very funny, funny joke,\u201d Katherine said.\n\nThe talk of serial killers didn\u2019t slow things down. They were so busy talking that they kept forgetting to look at the menu. Their poor server came by four times. It took them almost 40 minutes to order. When they were finally ready, Drew was happy to hear Katherine admit that she hated wine. He\u2019s not a wine drinker either \u2014 so they ordered beer instead. Both were weighing the potential deliciousness-to-disastrousness quotient of pasta on a first date \u2014 \u201cI had an intense internal debate over whether to eat pasta. You don\u2019t want to look like a fool eating spaghetti,\u201d Drew told me later. But by the time they were ready to order, both were willing to risk it.\n\n\n\nDrew and Katherine. (Photo by Daniele Seiss/For The Washington Post)\n\nShe got the spaghetti; he got the tagliatelle. They talked about their shared love of sci fi and their favorite TV shows. Katherine, a recreational boxer, impressed Drew with her passion for her work and hobbies, and he appreciated that she kept things light and fun. Katherine found it sweet that Drew, who plays volleyball and kickball and recently took up sailing, kept getting interrupted by texts from his sisters, grilling him for details on the date.\n\nThey also talked about their mutual distaste for the D.C. dating scene. Katherine really values vulnerability, and she often feels it\u2019s lacking in a city where so many people are trying to promote themselves. Going into the date, she said, \u201cI was trying to decide how vulnerable I should be with this person, and whether it would impact the date. It\u2019s something I want to be doing more of. My mind was spinning a bit. How much do I share, and how much will he share with The Washington Post?\u201d Joking around had helped her feel more comfortable about opening up, and it seemed to warm him up, too.\n\nA couple of hours into the date, they looked up and realized that no one else was in the restaurant. It was about to close, so they split a quick dessert, but they weren\u2019t ready to end the night just yet. They took a walk and kept talking. They discussed how awkward it was to end a date. Thankfully, this ending wasn\u2019t that awkward: They both said they wanted to see each other again.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is the key to a good date is, do you have inside jokes by end of the date?\u201d Katherine said. \u201cWe did, which was really funny. I\u2019ve never had that happen before.\u201d\n\nThe morning after the date, they were still texting \u2014 and still making jokes about serial killers.\n\nRate the date\n\nKatherine: 4 [out of 5].\n\nDrew: 4.9.\n\nUpdate\n\nAfter a second date, Drew and Katherine decided they weren\u2019t a match.\n\nMarin Cogan is a writer, senior producer and co-host for Pop Up Magazine.\n\nMore from Date Lab:\n\n\u2018You\u2019re a very lucky man,\u2019 a stranger said\n\nForget happily ever after.
