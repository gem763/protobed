HOW TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE\n\nHe asked people to join him and the World Pancreatic Cancer Coalition in raising awareness of the disease by wearing purple this November and spreading the word on social media ahead of \u201cWorld Pancreatic Cancer Day,\u201d which falls on Nov. 21.\n\nThe World Pancreatic Cancer Coalition includes more than 70 organizations from 30 countries and works to provide patients with the most up-to-date information about the disease. The American Cancer Society estimates that about 56,770 Americans will be diagnosed with the disease in 2019, resulting in an estimated 45,750 deaths. It accounts for about 3 percent of all cancers in the U.S., and about 7 percent of the nation\u2019s cancer deaths.\n\nPAUL BATURA: WHAT IS COURAGE? ALEX TREBEK CONTINUES TO SHOW US THE ANSWER AS HE BATTLES CANCER\n\nEarlier this month, Trebek told CTV News that his ongoing chemotherapy to treat stage 4 pancreatic cancer has left him with sores in his mouth, making it difficult for him to enunciate his speech. In that same interview, he shared that he has \u201clived a good life, a full life, and I\u2019m nearing the end of that life\u2026 If it happens, why should I be afraid of that?\u201d\n\nThe father of two returned to his longstanding position as host of \u201cJeopardy!\u201d in September.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' Tyler McCarthy contributed to this report.", "description": "In a minute-long video, Jeopardy host Alex Trebek said he wished he had known sooner that his persistent stomach pain was a symptom of the disease.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/07/694940094001_6092975302001_6092973517001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
