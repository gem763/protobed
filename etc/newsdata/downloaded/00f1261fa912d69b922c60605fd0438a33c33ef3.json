The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said it lost five fighters amid attacks from the Turkish military and its proxy militias, which struck civilian areas including a hospital.\n\nDespite his efforts to paint the deal as a triumph of diplomacy, Trump has faced blistering criticism at home and abroad over the agreement. Critics say it\u2019s a capitulation to Ankara that renders the U.S.\u2019 abandonment of the Kurds virtually complete, while simultaneously ceding five years of strategic influence in the conflict to rival Russia.\n\nUnder the 13-point deal, announced following a meeting with Vice President Mike Pence and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, Turkish troops agreed to halt their assault for 120 hours, while Kurdish forces would withdraw from a \u201csafe zone\u201d along the border, surrendering their heavy weaponry and having their positions destroyed.\n\nIn return, the U.S. would agree not to pursue heavy economic sanctions against Turkey, and Turkey would declare its mission over.\n\nObservers say that that would be only natural, because if realized, the deal would effectively deliver Turkey victory in its operation to drive back Kurdish forces from its border \u2014 while allowing Trump to attempt to sell the outcome as a political win to his critics at home.\n\nBut despite Trump\u2019s depiction, declaring that \u201cmillions of lives will be saved\u201d by the agreement, many lawmakers weren\u2019t buying it.\n\n\u201cThis isn't a ceasefire \u2014 it's a total capitulation to Turkey and the capstone of our abandonment of the Kurds,\u201d tweeted Sen. Chris Murphy.\n\n\u201cDon't pay attention to the headline \u2014 read the actual agreement. It's effectively surrender.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile the ceasefire might tamp down some of the violence, it was unlikely to draw a conclusive halt to the offensive, say critics, as the Turks and Kurds remain in apparent disagreement over the critical question of the scope of the Kurdish withdrawal.\n\nWhile the document refers to a ceasefire in a \u201csafe zone,\u201d the size of that area remains under dispute, Ege Seckin, principal analyst at IHS Markit Country Risk, told VICE News.\n\n\u201cThe deal does not explicitly state whether the safe zone in question covers the current area of Turkish military presence \u2014 the 120-kilometer stretch between Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain \u2014 or the full extent of the Turkey-Syria border controlled by the YPG,\u201d he said.\n\nSDF commander Mazloum Kobani told a Kurdish broadcaster late Thursday his forces agreed to the ceasefire, but that it only applied to the central stretch between stretch between Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain, not the Kurdish-held land to its east and west.\n\n\u201cNothing has been discussed for the other regions,\u201d he said. \u201cOur forces remain there.\u201d\n\nKurdish political leader Saleh Muslim also said that he welcomed the ceasefire, but continued to reject a Turkish occupation of the region.\n\n\u201cCeasefire is one thing, and surrender is another thing, and we are ready to defend ourselves. We will not accept the occupation of northern Syria,\u201d he told local television.\n\nTurkey has insisted the agreement isn\u2019t even a ceasefire, but a \u201cpause\u201d in its offensive, as it doesn\u2019t consider the Kurds a legitimate negotiating partner but a terrorist group.\n\nFurther complicating the picture is that the Syrian government and its Russian backers \u2014 who are now de facto in control of Kurdish-held regions in the north, following a deal last week between the Kurds and the regime last week \u2014 were not a party to the agreement.\n\nSeckin said that, given the problems evident already, the deal appeared destined to break down. He said the Kurds were highly unlikely to surrender their heavy weaponry to the Turks, which would likely lead to a continuation of the Turkish offensive.\n\nHe said Trump would then be able to blame the Kurds for the ongoing Turkish onslaught, helping to mitigate the widespread backlash he is facing from Congress over his decision to withdraw troops from the region, effectively greenlighting the Turkish assault.\n\nSeckin said that following the U.S. withdrawal, the Kurds\u2019 fate remained in the hands of the remaining major powerbroker in the conflict, Russia \u2013 and the final extent of the Turkish offensive was likely to be determined during Erdogan\u2019s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the end of the planned ceasefire, on Oct. 22.\n\n\u201cPutin will call the shots going forward, and Erdogan will likely lobby Putin to enforce a full surrender of the SDF and its breakup,\u201d he said.\n\nIf Erdogan was grateful for the favorable deal, he wasn\u2019t showing it Friday. When asked in a news conference about an extraordinary Oct. 9 letter from Trump in which the U.S. leader warned him not to be a \u201cfool,\u201d a \u201ctough guy\u201d or a \u201cdevil\u201d by invading Syria, Erdogan said he wouldn\u2019t forget the slight.\n\nREAD: Erdogan threw Trump\u2019s wild \u201cwarning\u201d letter in the trash and invaded Syria anyway\n\nDescribing the letter as out of line with political and diplomatic courtesy, Erdogan said: \u201cIt is not right for us to forget it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to know that we will do what is required about this issue when the right time comes.\u201d\n\nCover: Shortly after the Turkish operation inside Syria had started, local residents cheer and applaud as a convoy of Turkish forces vehicles is driven through the town of Akcakale, Sanliurfa province, southeastern Turkey, at the border between Turkey and Syria, Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2019.
