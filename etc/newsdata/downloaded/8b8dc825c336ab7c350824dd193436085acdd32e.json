The board said it removed the four -- all involved in the school's bully prevention program -- from teaching positions earlier this week and is considering taking disciplinary action against them.\n\nThe first victim complained that the senior teachers rubbed spicy ramen noodle soup against his eyes, forced him to drink alcohol and text obscene messages to a female teacher through a messaging app, got on top of his car and spilled drinks in the vehicle, and hit him on the bottom, according to the board.\n\nThe three other victims -- a man and two women -- also reported suffering verbal abuse and sexual harassment from the four, the board added.\n\nThe bullying of the first victim was reported to administrators of the school in June by other teachers. The school told the education board the following month there had been \"trouble among staff members but it was resolved internally.\"\n\nIn September, a relative of the first victim informed the board of the bullying.\n\nThe school briefed students' parents about the matter on Thursday night, and some expressed concern about the absence of five teachers and future management of the school.\n\nThe board said three teachers will be transferred to the school on Monday to fill in.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "A male teacher at an elementary school in western Japan has complained of being bullied by four senior colleagues, claiming they daubed curry on his body and rubbed spicy soup against his eyes, a local education board said Friday.
