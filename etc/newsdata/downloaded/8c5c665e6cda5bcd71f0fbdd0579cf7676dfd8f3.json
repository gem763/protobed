He said he also believed the case would go against the government.\n\nBefore the case, few thought the court would determine that Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen to suspend parliament for five weeks would be found unlawful. But over the course of the three-day hearing opinion has dramatically shifted.\n\n\u201cThe dominant feeling among informed observers is that the government is on the ropes and it\u2019s going to lose,\u201d said Philippe Sands QC, professor of law at University College London.\n\nJudges urged to back MPs' recall if they rule against prorogation Read more\n\nA panel of 11 justices heard appeals arising out of two separate legal challenges in England and Scotland, in which leading judges reached different conclusions.\n\nThe court\u2019s president, Lady Hale, has said the judges hope to give their decision early this week.\n\n\u201cWe are solely concerned with the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament on the dates in question,\u201d she said. \u201cAs we have heard, it is not a simple question, and we will now carefully consider all the arguments that have been presented to us.\u201d\n\nExperts were quick to identify three aspects of the case that should trouble the government. First, the judges spent a large portion of their time exploring possible remedies \u2013 what they might determine must happen if they find against the prime minister. In other cases, judges seldom devote effort to discussing remedies if they are not seriously considering finding in favour of the complainant, legal sources say.\n\nSecond, Hale\u2019s forensic questioning of the government\u2019s lawyer, Lord Keen, suggested she was dubious about the arguments he was presenting. Third, the fact that the court has yet to deliver a decision should send alarm bells ringing. In the words of one legal expert, \u201cthe fact they haven\u2019t given a decision now with reasons to follow would tend to suggest the government is going to lose at some level. If they were going to find for the government, why bother stringing it out?\u201d\n\nJohnson has pledged to abide by the ruling, but Keen refused to rule out that the government might suspend parliament again ahead of the Brexit deadline next month. Whatever the court decides will prove explosive. Lawyers opposing the government have claimed that Johnson\u2019s action was illegal, saying the \u201cexceptionally long\u201d prorogation was intended to \u201csilence\u201d parliament.\n\nBut Keen, on behalf of the government, submitted that the courts \u201cmust not cross the boundaries and intrude upon the business of parliament\u201d.\n\nSands said the crucial question was what remedy the court would suggest if it did find against the government. Much will rest on the detail in the court\u2019s decision and how it is framed. If the court determines that Johnson misled the Queen, that would make his position untenable, according to Dominic Grieve, the former Conservative attorney general.\n\nBut the court might choose to frame its verdict around whether Johnson\u2019s decision stymied the passage of legislation through parliament, which is potentially less incendiary.\n\nIf the court does find against the government, its lawyers will be scrutinising the decision to see if they can go back and order a second prorogation on other grounds.\n\nIt means that this week\u2019s decision is unlikely to be the end of the matter, whatever the justices decide.", "description": "Framing of verdict on prorogation of parliament may set off \u2018constitutional eruption of volcanic proportions\u2019", "authors": ["Jamie Doward"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d781e535fe2a26e06514cdf299886aca9207c494/0_108_3278_1967/master/3278.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=89fc0e550d221825a1f8f8a95637751b", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
