Those players generally don\u2019t come available in a trade.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns didn\u2019t pass up a chance when Odell Beckham Jr. was on the block. His fantastic 89-yard touchdown against the New York Jets was a reminder that he\u2019s a special talent. It was the longest play of his career.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThere\u2019s are always extraneous headlines with Beckham. He\u2019ll wear a $2 million watch in the pregame. He\u2019ll wear an illegal visor and complain he\u2019s being picked on.\n\nBut he is one heck of a player.\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. hits a huge play\n\nBeckham can break any game open with one play. The fans at MetLife Stadium have seen it before, though the fans who remember him best wear Giants colors.\n\nThe Browns were struggling to put away the Jets, who were down two quarterbacks after Trevor Siemian\u2019s injury. The offense hadn\u2019t done much. Then Baker Mayfield found Beckham on a quick route.\n\nMost receivers can\u2019t turn that into an 89-yard score. But Beckham burst into the secondary, had a sharp move at midfield to turn the safety around and then outraced the defense to the end zone.\n\nThe Browns landed a special talent in the offseason.\n\nCleveland Browns wide receiver Odell Beckham broke an 89-yard touchdown against the Jets. (AP)\n\nBeckham gets the best of Gregg Williams\n\nThere was a war of words between Beckham and Jets defensive coordinator Gregg Williams this past week. Beckham accused Williams of having his players take a cheap shot at him, when Williams was defensive coordinator of the Browns. Williams denied that and tried an \u201cOdell who?\u201d joke. It probably wasn\u2019t smart to give Beckham any more motivation.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeckham will always draw attention that teams don\u2019t necessarily love. He\u2019s a celebrity and everything he does is a story. He invites attention to himself.\n\nBut the Browns have no regrets.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
