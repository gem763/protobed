The average user spends over an hour per month on it.\"\n\nYes, but: While NBCU is making money, most smaller publishers Axios has spoken with say they aren't. It's common to hear publishers say they get millions of monthly views on Apple News, but rarely make any real money off of them.\n\nApple News does let publishers sell ads against their own content, and keep 100% of revenues they sell themselves, but it takes a cut of ads they sell on behalf of publishers on its platform.\n\nEditor's note: NBC is an investor in Axios and Andy Lack, chairman of NBC News and MSNBC, is a member of the Axios board of directors.\n\nGo deeper: NBC local TV group will no longer use ratings to sell ads", "description": "\"It's a very meaningfully-sized business compared to what we do on Youtube, Twitter or Snapchat.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/uSLGRYRBW-LQYk3pseR0UdP446g=/0x202:3000x1889/1920x1080/2019/10/15/1571145091823.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
