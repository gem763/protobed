(OPK) shares were up 12%, to $2.34, in premarket trading Monday.\n\nOPKO and Pfizer Inc. (PFE) said the Phase 3 trial evaluating somatrogon dosed once-weekly in pre-pubertal children with growth-hormone deficiency met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority to daily Genotropin for injection, as measured by annual height velocity at 12 months.\n\nThe results demonstrated the potential to reduce current dosing frequency from once-daily to a single weekly injection, the companies said.\n\nIn 2014, Pfizer and OPKO entered into a worldwide agreement for the development and commercialization of somatrogon for the treatment of GHD. OPKO is responsible for conducting the clinical program and Pfizer is responsible for registering and commercializing the product.\n\nPfizer shares were up 0.6% premarket, to $36.66.\n\nWrite to Michael Dabaie at michael.dabaie@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 21, 2019 08:44 ET (12:44 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
