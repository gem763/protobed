The XRP/USD pair even broke the $0.2250 support and settled well below the 100 hourly simple moving average. A low was formed near $0.2062 and the price recently corrected higher. It broke the $0.2250 and $0.2300 resistance levels. Moreover, the price is forming a decent support base near the $0.2300 level.\n\nThe last swing low was near $0.2244 before the price started an upside correction. There was a break above the $0.2350 resistance. Moreover, the price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $0.2502 high to $0.2244 low. However, the price seems to be facing a strong resistance near the $0.2450 level. There is also a solid bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.2440 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.\n\nThe trend line is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $0.2502 high to $0.2244 low. Above the trend line, the next important resistance is near the $0.2500 and $0.2550 levels. The 100 hourly simple moving average is also near the $0.2550 level. The current price action suggests that ripple could spike towards the $0.2500 or $0.2650 resistance area before it starts a fresh decrease.\n\nOnly a successful close above $0.2650 could start a strong rise in the near term. If not, there are chances of more downsides below the $0.2320 and $0.2300 support levels. The next key support is near the $0.2250 level, below which the price may perhaps retest $0.2060.\n\nLooking at the chart, ripple price is consolidating above the $0.2300 support area. There could be another rise, but upsides are likely to be capped near $0.2550 or $0.2650.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for XRP/USD is slowly moving into the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for XRP/USD is currently below the 50 level, with a positive angle.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $0.2300, $0.2250 and $0.2200.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $0.2450, $0.2550 and $0.0.2650.", "description": "Ripple price is currently consolidating above key supports against the US Dollar, while bitcoin is declining.
