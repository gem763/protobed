Now President Trump sees Mitt Romney as his harshest GOP foe.", "language": "en", "text": "Romney, however, refused to return the favor of an endorsement in 2016, calling Trump a \u201cphony,\u201d and the two were widely seen as detesting each other. Romney, just before taking his seat as a Republican senator from Utah in January, wrote in an op-ed that Trump \u201chas not risen to the mantle of his office.\u201d\n\nTwo months later, little known to the public, Trump and Romney met for lunch at the White House. The subject was supposed to be their shared belief that the United States needed to take tough action against China\u2019s trade policies. The effort at a rapprochement, described in interviews by Romney and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who facilitated it, went further and deeper than expected or publicly known.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs had happened time and again in one of the most bizarre relationships in Republican politics, it fell apart in a blizzard of bitter words. Romney became one of the most outspoken Republican critics in the Senate of Trump\u2019s telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the president\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria.\n\nThe senator was praised by Democrats for showing spine, and, on cue, he was attacked by Trump on Twitter for being a \u201cpompous ass.\u201d\n\nNow, the relationship could be nearing its climactic scene. If the House votes to impeach Trump, as is expected, Romney could soon take on a defining role in his career: a juror in the Senate trial of Trump. The potential that he could take a leadership role in a Senate trial has made him a central target of Trump\u2019s ire, prompting the president to say that the senator from Utah is the only leading member of the party who has failed to fall in line to support him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think [Democrats are] lousy politicians,\u201d Trump said during a Cabinet meeting on Monday. \u201cBut two things they have: They\u2019re vicious and they stick together. They don\u2019t have Mitt Romney in their midst. They don\u2019t have people like that. They stick together.\u201d\n\nRomney, in an interview with The Washington Post, insisted he had not made up his mind about whether to vote for conviction, but neither has he followed other Republicans in criticizing the efforts by Democrats to impeach the president.\n\n\u201cI am going to wait to see if impeachment articles come,\u201d Romney said. \u201cIf they do come, I will review all the facts as they are presented at that point and make a decision which I believe is right.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump declined to comment.\n\nMerely by insisting he has the traditional mind-set of a juror \u2014 an open mind \u2014 Romney has drawn attention, including his use of a pseudonymous Twitter handle under the name of Pierre Delecto, an account Romney used to praise his actions and criticize Trump.\n\nAD\n\nRomney, as a symbol of the establishment that Trump so often rails against, may have difficulty gaining the support of other senators for his stance, and he said he has no need to personally lobby anyone. If he decides to vote to convict the president, he could be the first Republican to declare his intention, breaking a barrier that others might be emboldened to follow.\n\nAD\n\nRomney is \u201cgrowing into the role of being the principal voice\u201d against Trump, said former Republican strategist Rick Wilson, who has written two anti-Trump books. It is an \u201cintimidating and terrifying process\u201d because Trump wields so much power, Wilson said. But he said Romney has little to lose: He has wealth, the love of his family, the sustenance of his Mormon faith \u2014 and five years until he faces reelection.\n\nA football friendship\n\nWhatever path Romney chooses, it is most unlikely a denouement of a relationship between Trump and Romney that began nearly a quarter-century ago over their shared love of football.\n\nAD\n\nIn the 1990s, Romney began cultivating influential people who might become key supporters of a political campaign. Two months after his failed 1994 campaign for the Senate seat held by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), Romney accepted an invitation to fly on Trump\u2019s plane to Palm Beach to attend the Super Bowl, which was held in Miami in January 1995.\n\nAD\n\nRomney recalled meeting Trump\u2019s then-wife, Marla Maples, and their young child, Tiffany, and being slightly star-struck.\n\n\u201cHe was a very entertaining person,\u201d Romney told The Post. \u201cI had known him as a highly visible media personality.\u201d Romney said his reaction was like that of many people: \u201cOh, there\u2019s Donald Trump, famous, colorful and entertaining.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Romney recalled in an interview, Trump showed him a cache of \u201cgold silverware\u201d that was left behind by a prior owner. Trump \u201ctook us into a large walk-in safe and . . . commented he paid less for [Mar-a-Lago] than he thought the silverware was worth.\u201d\n\nThe two sat together at the Super Bowl and later went to National Football League games in New Jersey and Massachusetts. By the time they saw the New England Patriots play in the early 2000s, Trump had divorced Maples and brought along Melania Knauss, whom he would later marry.\n\nOn the surface, Trump and Romney had much in common. They were both beneficiaries of family heritages \u2014 with Trump following his father into real estate development and Romney, who served one term as Massachusetts governor, carrying on the political legacy of his father, who was governor of Michigan. Trump told associates that he had long been impressed with Romney\u2019s work at the leveraged-buyout company Bain Capital, and Romney in turn complimented Trump\u2019s building projects.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2007, Trump delivered what appears to be his first public praise of Romney. He said in an interview on CNN that Romney was one of the top three presidential candidates \u2014 after Rudolph W. Giuliani, for whom he hosted a fundraiser and is now Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, and then-Sen. John McCain.\n\n\u201cI know him, I like him,\u201d Trump told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer when asked about Romney. \u201cVery attractive guy . . . certainly an attractive candidate. He\u2019s a very smart guy.\u201d\n\nMcCain won the nomination and surprised many Republicans when he bypassed Romney as a vice-presidential pick. After McCain lost to Barack Obama and Republicans focused on whom to nominate in 2012, Romney and Trump were frequently mentioned. Trump wound up endorsing Romney, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s my honor, real honor, to endorse Mitt Romney.\u201d Trump singled out Romney\u2019s stance on China, saying he was \u201cone of the few who has stood up to say China is cheating\u201d on trade deals.\n\nOn Election Day 2012, Trump flew to Boston, expecting to attend a victory celebration. But as he watched the returns on his plane and realized Romney would lose, he ordered that his plane be turned around and began plotting his own run for the presidency.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVenting his frustration on Twitter, and foreshadowing how he would run a campaign, Trump tweeted: \u201cWe can\u2019t let this happen. The world is laughing at us.\u201d Then he filed a trademark application for the phrase \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\n\nFour years later, when Trump ran for the presidency, Romney refused to return the favor of an endorsement. He called Trump a phony and predicted that Trump\u2019s \u2018\u2018foreign policies would make America and the world less safe.\u201d\n\nTrump responded that Romney was a \u201cchoker\u201d who walked like a penguin. The split seemed irrevocable.\n\nAfter Trump won, Romney accepted an invitation to dine with the president-elect in New York for what was billed as an audition to be secretary of state. Romney insisted to reporters that he had been \u201cvery impressed\u201d by Trump\u2019s \u201cenlightening\u201d victory speech, giving him \u201cincreasing hope\u201d that Trump was \u201cthe very man\u201d who could lead the country to a \u201cbetter future.\u201d\n\nStill, it seemed a mismatch. Romney had declared that Russia was the greatest political enemy of the United States, and Trump spoke glowingly of Russian leader Vladimir Putin. In the end, Trump picked Exxon chief executive Rex Tillerson, and Romney\u2019s vetting was viewed as a purposeful and public humiliation.\n\nTwo years later, Romney easily won election as a senator from Utah, where many voters share his Mormon faith and conservatism. While Utah is one of the most Republican-leaning states, many voters echoed Romney\u2019s disdain for Trump, who won the state but received only 45 percent of the vote. An independent candidate received 27 percent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe stage was set either for a genuine partnership or a complete break of the relationship. Romney lashed out even before taking office by writing an op-ed in The Post that was critical of Trump. While Romney supported Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts and other measures, he faulted the president for his \u201cglaring\u201d lack of comity and absent leadership in foreign affairs.\n\nThe op-ed drew immediate notice from Trump, who tweeted: \u201cHere we go with Mitt Romney. . . . He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s words were retweeted by Romney\u2019s niece, Ronna Romney McDaniel, whom Trump had placed as chairwoman of the Republican National Committee. She condemned her uncle, tweeting: \u201cFor an incoming Republican freshman senator to attack @realdonaldtrump as their first act feeds into what the Democrats and media want and is disappointing and unproductive.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMcDaniel declined to comment. In a statement to The Post, she said, \u201cWhile Mitt and I have our disagreements, my family is certainly not the only one that has differing opinions.\u201d\n\nAn intervention\n\nTwo months after the op-ed was published, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) planned an intervention, persuading the president to meet with Romney.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I said to him about Mitt Romney,\u201d Graham said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the smartest guys I know. I share a worldview that he shares.\u201d Trump agreed to meet with Romney for lunch at the White House, with Graham serving as a sort of mediator.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things the president does I don\u2019t like,\u201d Graham said in an interview. \u201cI am trying to channel that. . . . I am trying to find a way to make him successful. He is a handful. I don\u2019t know where Mitt Romney and Donald Trump wind up landing. But in Trump\u2019s world, everything is possible, and I know that Mitt Romney is driven by love of country.\u201d\n\nIt was agreed that the discussion at the meeting would be about China policy, an area where Romney and Trump have agreed. Romney had said during his 2012 campaign that he would declare China to be a currency manipulator, and Trump declared in his campaign that he would take that action on his first day in office \u2014 a vow that he did not keep.\n\n\u201cI expressed my view that he was right to push back on China, that we had let them get away with unfair trade practices for far too long,\u201d Romney said in the interview. \u201cAt the same time, I told him I disagreed with the tariffs on aluminum and steel. I told him they hurt Americans more than they hurt others and that I thought they were counterproductive.\u201d\n\nAfter the meeting, Trump had a surprise: He invited Romney and Graham to attend a meeting in the Oval Office with a U.S. citizen, Danny Burch, who recently had been released as a hostage in Yemen. The release was arranged with the help of a former Romney campaign adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, who served as Trump\u2019s special envoy for hostage affairs.\n\nRomney left the White House thinking he had restored a positive relationship with Trump. But Romney\u2019s concern about the president\u2019s foreign policy was growing.\n\nThe next month, Romney traveled with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) to the Middle East, including stops in Israel, Jordan and Iraq. They heard from Israelis and Palestinians that a two-state solution \u2014 which Romney has endorsed \u2014 seemed almost impossible during a Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe both came away very concerned that the two-state solution was completely slipping away from all of our grasps,\u201d Murphy said in an interview. \u201cThat was certainly frightening to sort of see and feel in person when you are on the ground there. . . . There didn\u2019t seem to be a Plan B.\u201d\n\nThe two also received a briefing from CIA officials who said the Islamic State was seeking to make a comeback. The officials\u2019 warning reverberated as Trump considered withdrawing U.S. military forces in northeastern Syria that provided protection to the Kurds, who had been allied with the U.S. military to capture and contain Islamic State fighters.\n\nRomney had reason to hope that Trump would maintain the U.S. military presence in Syria, due in part to the president\u2019s decision in mid-September to select O\u2019Brien, the former Romney adviser, as his national security adviser.\n\nWhen Trump a month later abruptly ordered U.S. troops out of the area \u2014 enabling Turkey to take control of Kurdish-held land in northeastern Syria \u2014 Romney was livid.\n\nTaking to the Senate floor, Romney delivered the harshest attack on the president by any Republican senator on Syria policy, describing the withdrawal of U.S. forces as \u201ca bloodstain in the annals of American history.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica has abandoned an ally, adding insult to dishonor,\u201d he said.\n\nWithin days, other Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), echoed Romney\u2019s words.\n\nO\u2019Brien declined to comment. A White House official said Romney was not involved in the decision to give the national security adviser job to O\u2019Brien. National Security Council spokesman Michael Martin said O\u2019Brien \u201cfully supports the President\u2019s Syria strategy.\u201d\n\nRomney\u2019s deepest criticism of the president has been over the subject of the impeachment inquiry: Trump\u2019s telephone call with Zelensky.\n\nReferring to the rough transcript in which Trump urged Zelensky to investigate former vice president and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, Romney said on Twitter that \u201cif the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump publicly said Ukraine and China should investigate the Bidens, Romney said such a \u201cbrazen\u201d request was \u201cwrong and appalling\u201d and \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d\n\nTrump punched back. He tweeted that Romney \u201cnever knew how to win.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is a pompous \u2018ass\u2019 who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him) and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn\u2019t give it to him),\u201d the tweet said.\n\nIn another tweet, Trump called Romney a \u201cfool,\u201d ending with the social media hashtag #IMPEACHMITTROMNEY.\n\nThat is not possible. Senators, unlike the president of the United States, are not subject to impeachment.\n\nSen. Murphy is mystified by the way Romney has been ostracized by some in his party, noting that the senator is a classical conservative.\n\n\u201cI think it is such a tragic statement about the moment we are in that Romney\u2019s colleagues are so openly critical of him simply because he doesn\u2019t follow the president blindly like the rest of them,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIn any other era, the way in which Mitt Romney approaches his job would be middle of the pack. He looks like an outlier simply because he is not willing to follow the president on every issue and on every behavior without question.\u201d\n\nGraham, meanwhile, still hopes the two can find a way to get along, but he said that the president realizes \u201cthe damage has been done.\u201d As for his own role, Graham said: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go into marriage counseling.\u201d", "description": "One of the most bizarre relationships in Republican politics could soon reach its climax as the Senate prepares for a possible trial of the president.", "authors": ["Michael Kranish", "National Political Investigative Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3vHBCSlYcwm91-Am7tTXhVi81G4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SPDPKWXXQYI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
