I sincerely apologize.\u201d\n\nAt the event in California on Tuesday, Fisher spoke about how he built his company, Fisher Investments, which manages $112 billion. He compared the process of gaining a client\u2019s trust to \u201ctrying to get into a girl\u2019s pants\u201d and talked about genitalia.\n\nSoon after his remarks became public in a video posted on Twitter by a financial adviser, Fisher issued a statement through his spokesman and said his comments were misunderstood.\n\n\u201cWhile I said words he cited I don\u2019t think he heard me correctly and clearly misconstrued my meaning and certainly my intended meaning,\u201d Fisher said Wednesday. \u201cTo the extent he and any others were offended I apologize truly and sincerely.\u201d\n\nLater, in an interview with Bloomberg, he expressed surprise by the reaction to his remarks.\n\n\u201cI have given a lot of talks a lot of times in a lot of places and said stuff like this and never gotten that type of response,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cMostly the audience understands what I am saying.\u201d\n\nFisher\u2019s apology on Thursday came after the conference organizer barred him from attending future events.\n\nTiburon Strategic Advisors Managing Partner Charles \u201cChip\u201d Roame said he was \u201cextremely disappointed,\u201d according to a statement posted on the organization\u2019s website.\n\nThe \u201ccomments lacked the dignity and respect that should be expected by any Tiburon CEO Summit speaker or attendee\u201d and \u201cI further barred the speaker from ever attending again,\u201d Roame said.\n\nRoame said the remarks added to the gender diversity problem in the wealth and management industry. In one study he cited, women accounted for 58% of employees in the financial services industry, but only 48% of first and mid-level management roles and 31% of senior and executive level management roles.\n\n(Adds Tiburon comments in 10th paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Sabrina Willmer in New York at swillmer2@bloomberg.net;Gwen Everett in New York at geverett10@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alan Mirabella at amirabella@bloomberg.net, Vincent Bielski\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Two days after billionaire Ken Fisher made a series of offensive comments at an event that were condemned by attendees, he now says he\u2019s really sorry.\u201cSome of the words and phrases I used during a recent conference to make certain points were clearly wrong and I shouldn\u2019t have made them", "authors": ["Sabrina Willmer", "Gwen Everett"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kC7Q_hWMcM3Ew37tAU7lxA--~B/aD0xNDY3O3c9MjIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/90e4a757e7c51b5b5812169ed9fac9a4", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
