That allowed the go-ahead run to cross the plate and Soto to get to second, then turn for third.\n\nEventually, Soto, a 20-year-old outfielder, was caught in a rundown to end the inning, but that didn't matter: He had turned a 3-1 deficit into a lead, and so he clapped his hands, then pounded his chest and high-fived third base coach Bob Henley, shouting \"Let's go!\"\n\n\"The inning was an ugly inning,\" Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. \"Crazy things happen.\"\n\nWATCH | Nationals top Brewers in NL wild-card game:\n\nJuan Soto delivered the game-winning hit in the eighth inning, giving Washington a 4-3 win over Milwaukee. 2:11\n\nGrisham's take?\n\n\"It's gonna sting,\" he said.\n\nStephen Strasburg threw three scoreless innings to earn the win in the first relief appearance of his major league career, regular season or playoffs.\n\nDaniel Hudson pitched the ninth for the save.

Beat LA!\" as members of the Nationals lingered on the infield with family members after the rare playoff triumph for a franchise that had never before advanced in the playoffs since moving to Washington from Montreal before the 2005 season.\n\n\"We've been here a bunch of times. Never kind of broke through,\" said Ryan Zimmerman, the Nationals' first draft pick back in 2005, who singled as a pinch hitter in the eighth. \"Finally caught a break tonight.\"\n\nYes, Washington had been 0-3 in winner-take-all post-season games, all NLDS Game 5 losses at home.\n\nBut this time was different. Thanks, in large part, to one of the kids making his debut in October, Soto, who is wholly unencumbered by any past playoff failings on this stage and in this stadium.\n\nBrewers strike first\n\nStill, things didn't look good early for Washington.\n\nYasmani Grandal and Eric Thames homered in the first two innings off Nationals ace Max Scherzer, a three-time Cy Young Award winner whose teams had lost each of his most recent seven post-season games.\n\nMilwaukee led the NL in walks, and Scherzer put leadoff man Grisham aboard.\n\nThe first pitch to the next batter, Grandal, came in at 98 mph and was transformed into a blink-and-you-missed-it shot that rapidly reached the bullpen beyond right field. The ball landed with such force that it bounced back onto the outfield grass.\n\nJust like that \u2014 three minutes and seven pitches into the evening \u2014 the Brewers led 2-0.\n\nThe once-rowdy park sunk into sudden silence; if all of those red-wearing spectators' thoughts could be heard, they might have been summed up as a sigh. Strasburg paced in the bullpen.\n\nMilwaukee went up 3-0 in the second when Thames' first career post-season at-bat ended with him driving a curveball deep to right-centre.\n\nThat meant Scherzer had given up a pair of homers in three of his past six post-season appearances \u2014 and in each of his last three games in 2019.\n\nWashington got one run off Brandon Woodruff on a solo shot from Trea Turner in the third off a high fastball, making it 3-1.", "description": "Washington's Juan Soto delivered a bases-loaded single against Josh Hader that scored three runs with two outs in the bottom of the eighth inning, and the Nationals rallied to beat the Milwaukee Brewers 4-3 in the NL wild-card game Tuesday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5305409.1569986444!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1178469466.jpg"}
