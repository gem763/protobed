It\u2019s 1-year Z-score was over +2 standard deviations for the first time in 12 months. There were also 5.5 long contracts to every short, although this ratio actually peaked at 6.3 two weeks prior. However, this marketed the swing high, and DXY has since retraced from its peak, so these metrics will be a little less stretched. From a price action perspective, DXY remains within a bullish channel, and its structure remains bullish above 98.6, so whilst this level holds, we favor a break to new highs.\n\nLarge Speculative Positioning\n\nAs of Tuesday 1st October:\n\nNet-long exposure to gold was reduced by -11.6%\n\nPlatinum traders reduced net-long exposure by 10.5%\n\nBullish exposure to palladium hit a 3-month high\n\nGold - Large Speculative Positioning\n\nGold: Gold bulls closed 47.6k long contracts last week, their largest weekly reduction since December 2017. This saw net-long exposure drop by 11.6%. Incidentally, the report (which was compiled on 1st October) marked the swing low on Gold. It\u2019s also worth noting that net-long exposure was near record highs ahead of the bullish reduction. (The record high was in 2016). Whilst we\u2019ve observed stretched positioning and warned of a potential inflection point, geopolitical tensions and weak economic data have proven too difficult to build a bear case for the yellow metal. But if those supportive features were to be removed, it then opens up the potential for a deeper correction. For now, gold could remain stubbornly near its highs and trade within a range.\n\nPalladium Large Speculative Positioning\n\nPalladium: Traders have remained net-long on palladium since 2003. However, whilst prices remain at record highs, net-long exposure isn\u2019t flagging a sentiment extreme with one and 3-year Z-score at +1.3 and -0.2 standard deviations, respectively. Until price action suggests otherwise, palladium appears favorable to trend traders (or those seeking to buy dips).\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
