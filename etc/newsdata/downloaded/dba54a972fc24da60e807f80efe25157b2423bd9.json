The 20-year-old, who won his fourth England cap in Saturday\u2019s 4-0 victory against Bulgaria in qualifying for Euro 2020, said that he has received messages about people going to his home and added that his parents were also targeted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had people saying they\u2019re going to come to my house ... yeah online,\u201d Rice said in an interview with ITV News. \u201cThere\u2019s a few bits I could go into but I don\u2019t need to go into it, threats to my family, threats to me. It was tough, there has been some abuse. It was more for my mum and dad really.\u201d\n\nEngland seek balance between blooding youth and qualification Read more\n\nSouthgate said he had feared there would be a negative reaction towards Rice following the West Ham player\u2019s decision to represent England. The manager said: \u201cMy concern with the transfer across associations was always the implications for him and his family. That\u2019s why I thought it was a very sensitive subject and I didn\u2019t want to push a decision because there was always going to be a reaction, but he has dealt all the way through, since his decision, with that really calmly, very maturely, and we have to hope that everything kind of passes on now.\u201d\n\nSouthgate, who is considering replacing Marcus Rashford with Jadon Sancho when England host Kosovo at St Mary\u2019s this evening, added that the anonymity offered by social media is making abuse worse. \u201cI think the reality of being in the public eye is, whether it\u2019s through social media or other formats, people are subjected to abuse and I think people are naive if they don\u2019t realise that has happened for years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut social media is clearly amplifying that and I think it\u2019s possible to have tighter controls. There is some responsibility for the companies involved to, for want of a better phrase, police that a little bit more strictly than they have.\u201d\n\nJordan Henderson echoed calls by Rashford to force people to identify themselves when they create accounts on social media. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise people could just create accounts and you don\u2019t know who it is,\u201d the Liverpool midfielder said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one way forward. If someone could do something about that, that would be great and that would help.\n\n\u201cI think for the lads, they just need to be sensible with it and not read too much into it. I think it\u2019s good to interact with the fans who support them, encourage them and want them to do well, but you\u2019re also going to get people who are going to criticise you and you\u2019ve just got to get on with it. Don\u2019t read the comments.\u201d\n\nEngland have won their first three qualifiers in Group A and Southgate is likely to tweak his side against Kosovo, who have eight points from four games after beating the Czech Republic on Saturday. Trent Alexander-Arnold is expected to replace Kieran Trippier at right-back and Sancho is in line to start alongside Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling in attack.\n\nSancho, who came off the bench for Sterling on Saturday, has been in scintillating form for Borussia Dortmund and Southgate wants to give opportunities to the 19-year-old. \u201cHe\u2019s confident in his own ability,\u201d he said. \u201cI said when I named the squad, he\u2019s not a player we\u2019re looking to hold back. He\u2019s real competition. He\u2019s very diligent in his work, as well as the fact that he\u2019s exciting in his ability to beat people.\u201d", "description": "Declan Rice, the England and West Ham midfielder, has received support from Gareth Southgate following online threats over his switch of allegiance from Ireland", "authors": ["Jacob Steinberg"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5685d5d5740fbd0b06dba639c68286ecb7ee6e4/0_85_3563_2137/master/3563.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b417b39f9c488d06b10c1fe61d6c9996", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
