Mr. Maguire said he did not believe that Mr. Coats nor Ms. Gordon was even aware a whistleblower complaint had been filed with Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community.\n\n\u201cTo the best of my ability, I do not think either Director Coats or our principal deputy, Sue Gordon, have any sense at all about this whistleblower complaint or that Michael Atkinson had it,\u201d\n\nMr. Maguire\u2019s claim came when Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, Illinois Democrat, questioned him on whether he discussed the compliant with his predecessor.\n\nThe acting DNI also said he wouldn\u2019t have taken the job if they had alerted to him to the complaint.\n\nMr. Maguire assumed office roughly a week after the unknown whistleblower submitted the complaint to Mr. Atkinson.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
