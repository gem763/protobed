Because he is the head of both, the appearance of one church remains, while in fact there are two,\u201d Weinandy concludes.\n\nIt is \u201cthe nature of the present possible schism that is new, and this unprecedented new schism is frightening,\u201d Weinandy writes.\n\nThis problematic situation has become even more evident with the currents pervading the Vatican synod taking place this month.\n\nThe present Amazon Synod \u201cis teeming with participants sympathetic to and supportive of all of the above,\u201d Weinandy writes. \u201cOne must likewise take into account the many theologically dubious cardinals, bishops, priests, and theologians whom Francis supports and promotes to high ecclesial positions.\u201d\n\nThe expression coined by Weinandy to describe this situation is \u201cinternal papal schism,\u201d since the pope \u201cwill effectively be the leader of a segment of the Church that through its doctrine, moral teaching, and ecclesial structure, is for all practical purposes schismatic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the real schism that is in our midst and must be faced, but I do not believe Pope Francis is in any way afraid of this schism,\u201d he adds. \u201cAs long as he is in control, he will, I fear, welcome it, for he sees the schismatic element as the new \u2018paradigm\u2019 for the future Church.\u201d\n\nWe need to pray that Jesus will deliver us from this trial, he notes, while acknowledging that he may want us to endure it to purify the Church \u201cfrom all the sin and corruption that now lies within her.\u201d\n\nIt will be the laity, especially lay women, who will bring about the needed purification, he concludes.\n\nIf the laity raise their voices, \u201cthey will be heard,\u201d he states.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "The former doctrinal chief of the U.S. Bishops warned this week that Pope Francis is presiding over an \u201cunprecedented new schism\u201d in the Catholic Church.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
