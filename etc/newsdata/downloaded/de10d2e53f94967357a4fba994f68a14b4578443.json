A whistleblower complaint at the center of the inquiry alleged that Trump pressured Ukraine\u2019s leader on a July 25 call to investigate the US president\u2019s Democratic rival.\n\nTrump says he acted appropriately, but he has relentlessly hammered Biden and his son as \u201ccorrupt.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Biden, Warren face attacks \u2013\n\nMcKinney said Biden could flip the attention to his advantage, convincing voters that he\u2019s the Democrat Trump fears most in 2020.\n\n\u201cBiden must demonstrate his aggressiveness and ability to take on the issue of Donald Trump coming at him directly about him and his son,\u201d McKinney said.\n\nHe has. Saying Trump \u201cbetrayed this nation,\u201d Biden on Wednesday called for the president\u2019s impeachment for the first time.\n\n\u201cLet me make something clear to President Trump: I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he added Friday on Twitter. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me.\u201d\n\nWarren called for Trump\u2019s impeachment months ago, perhaps signaling that, while Biden earlier hedged his bets, she recognized the urgency that a growing number of Democrats feel about ousting Trump.\n\nThe 70-year-old progressive senator has surged in recent weeks, drawing virtually even with Biden in polling \u2014 and raising the likelihood that debate rivals will go after her.\n\nOnstage Democrats may also pounce on Biden, and argue that his son\u2019s work for a Ukrainian energy company while Biden was vice president has at least the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nThe impeachment saga shook up the campaign trail for all candidates, and they have been recalibrating accordingly.\n\nSanders acknowledged as much on September 24, when the liberal senator who supports Trump\u2019s impeachment spoke of its risks.\n\n\u201cThis is a complicated issue from a political point of view,\u201d Sanders told reporters in Davenport, Iowa.\n\nOne week later the 78-year-old suffered a mild heart attack, slowing his campaign just when he needed a fresh boost.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling great and we\u2019re going to run a vigorous campaign,\u201d Sanders told CNN Thursday.\n\nThe setback put the health and age of not only Sanders, but Biden \u2014 who turns 77 next month and has been criticized for lacking vitality in debates \u2014 into the spotlight.\n\nSanders must \u201cconvince voters that he\u2019s not out of it,\u201d and the debate is a chance to do that, McKinney said.\n\nIf he does not, and \u201cif Warren is able to solidify\u2026 the progressive wing, we could see a continuation of her rise and a taking over of Joe Biden,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile Warren has gained steam, the air has wheezed out of many low-polling candidates, who are grasping for anything to revive their flat-lining campaigns.\n\nBut the impeachment fracas could benefit one new face on stage: Tom Steyer.\n\nThe billionaire activist, making his debate debut Tuesday, has spent two years advocating for Trump\u2019s removal from office.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Joe Biden faces scrutiny over Ukraine, Elizabeth Warren is surging and Bernie Sanders had a heart attack, but recent developments", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/e16a6f_democratic-white-house-hopeful-joe-biden-is-pushing-fiercely-us-president-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
