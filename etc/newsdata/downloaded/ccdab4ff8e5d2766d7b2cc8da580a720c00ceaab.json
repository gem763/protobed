Blink and you could miss it.\n\n- Handre Pollard v Yu Tamura -\n\nPollard, blessed with a sublime kicking game, alternated fly-half duties with Elton Jantjies during the pool stages but he will marshal South Africa for the showdown with Japan.\n\nHe is up against a slightly unknown quantity in the shape of Tamura, who has been a revelation for the host side.\n\nCool as a cucumber, Tamura leads the World Cup with 48 points so far and has landed 10 penalties -- also a tournament high -- despite not always understanding the instructions English-speaking team-mates are barking at him.\n\nTamura's kicking has been spot-on and he never shirks a tackle. His calmness under pressure alongside Leitch and veterans such as Shota Horie and Luke Thompson will be crucial when Japan face a fired-up South Africa side with serious World Cup ambitions and hell-bent on exorcising the demons of the \"Brighton Miracle\".", "description": "Three head-to-heads for the Rugby World Cup quarter-final between hosts Japan and South Africa in Tokyo on Sunday:- Siya Kolisi v Michael Leitch -Both...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/05/wire-19870184-1571373775-118_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
