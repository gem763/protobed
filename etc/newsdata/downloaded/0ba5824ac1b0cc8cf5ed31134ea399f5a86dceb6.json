Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOvernight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Planned Parenthood plans M campaign for 2020 | Dem candidates embrace aggressive step on drug prices | Officials propose changes to encourage 'value-based' care Sanders denies campaign was not transparent about heart attack: 'That's nonsense' Sanders, Castro, Gabbard to appear in town hall hosted by Latino civil rights organization MORE (I) says he is recovering quickly after suffering a heart attack last week and promised to return to the campaign trail \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\n\nIn a 7-minute-long direct-to-camera video posted on Instagram, which was filmed with the sound of a heart monitor beeping in the background, Sanders reiterated his intention to participate in the Democratic presidential primary debate on Tuesday outside Columbus, Ohio.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI am feeling great,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI\u2019m getting my endurance back and I look forward to getting back on the campaign trail as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am feeling really good and getting stronger every day,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be out there on the campaign trail, we\u2019re gonna be in the debate in Columbus, Ohio next week.\u201d\n\nThe Vermont senator opened up about his time \u201clying in a hospital bed in Las Vegas\u201d after experiencing chest pains. The doctors inserted two stents to address a blocked artery.\n\nSanders, who is 78, has leaned on the experience to further push his \"Medicare for All\" plan, warning that many people do not have the level of health coverage that he has, and that ordinary Americans bypass trips to the doctor for medical emergencies all the time over fears they will not be able to afford the medicine or procedures they need.\n\n\u201cWhat happens if somebody had no health insurance who felt a pain in his or her chest or felt really sick and said to themselves, \u2018Do I really want to go to the doctor or the hospital because I can\u2019t afford to pay for the medical bills I\u2019ll incur?' How many people are in that position? How many people have died because they don\u2019t get to the doctor, the hospital when they should?\u201d Sanders said.\n\n\u201cIt made me feel even more strongly the need to continue our efforts to end this dysfunctional and cruel health care system which leaves so many people uninsured. ... It is an insane, wasteful, bureaucratic system based on the greed of the health care system,\u201d he added.\n\nSanders also previewed what he described as the coming showdown between his campaign and the \u201cDemocratic establishment\u201d and the \u201ccorporate media,\u201d who he said would oppose the radical changes he\u2019s proposing to the multibillion-dollar industries he hopes to reform.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s not easy because this campaign, we\u2019re taking on everybody,\u201d Sanders said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not only taking on Trump and the Republican establishment; we\u2019re not only taking on the Democratic establishment; we\u2019re not only taking on Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military-industrial complex, the prison industrial complex, the corporate media that so often refuses to deal with the real issues facing this country, that\u2019s what we\u2019re taking on. But at the end of the day, if you\u2019re gonna look at yourself in the mirror, you\u2019re gonna say, look, I go around once, I have one life to live. What role do I want to play?\u201d", "description": "Vermont Sen.
