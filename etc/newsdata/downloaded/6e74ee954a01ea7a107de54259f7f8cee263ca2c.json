Canaccord Genuity analyst Benn Skender believes the shares could be worth $4.25 when the Rip Curl acquisition is bedded down.\n\nMr Duke, who owns 77 per cent of Briscoe, said the Australian listing had been worthwhile, even if Briscoe had yet to make an acquisition here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"When we spoke to institutions in 2015 and 2016, a number showed some real interest but they were not mandated to invest in any stocks not listed in Australia,\" he said.\n\n\"Strategically it's a clever move if we have visions of expanding in the region.\"\n\nBriscoe's first-half sales rose 3.3 per cent to $NZ302.98 million but net profit was flat at $NZ29.41 million as gross margins came under pressure from increased competition, the weaker New Zealand dollar and a late start to winter.\n\nThe group earned $NZ1.71 million in dividends from its stake in Kathmandu.", "description": "Four years after its unsuccessful takeover offer for Kathmandu, New Zealand retailer Briscoe Group is looking for acquisitions in Australia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_201%2C$y_569/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cf3375922198bbee8dad648ad191779edfad3158", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
