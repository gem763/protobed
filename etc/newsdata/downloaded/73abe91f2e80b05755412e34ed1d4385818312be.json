The current Brooklyn Nets superstar said in a recent Wall Street Journal story that he no longer feels a connection to the Oklahoma City Thunder, and the reasons why he decided to leave the Golden State Warriors.\n\nIncluded in Durant\u2019s recent comments were those decrying the state of a basketball player\u2019s life, saying that sometimes he, \u201chate(s) the circus of the NBA.\u201d\n\nFolks responded strongly to Durant\u2019s comments, with many understanding the mental strain an outsized, constant media attention would put on any person.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThen again, others felt as though players had to accept that attention in exchange for the hefty salaries and sponsorship deals they gain because of it.\n\nYou can put Scottie Pippen in that second category, by the way.\n\nSpeaking on ESPN\u2019s \u201cThe Jump\u201d, Pippen said that Durant ultimately had to have the right perspective.\n\nI understand what Kevin is saying, but I also want to let him know that this is a part of our business. This is why he\u2019s making all that money. Because, we\u2019ve been able to globalize the game through our players. Not just what they do on a basketball court, but, you know \u2014 using digital stuff of them talking, travelling abroad, to help promote our game. It\u2019s part of our package to help promote our game, because that helps our salaries grow. So I don\u2019t get what he\u2019s saying, especially with a player that\u2019s been in the league as long as he has.\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty reasonable expectation. Every person is allowed to have their mental headspace in balance, but the undeniable context of professional sports is of imbalance.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf he\u2019s going to cash the big checks, he\u2019s going to have to \u201cplay the game\u201d as it were, even if that means not playing the actual game. And of course, he\u2019s welcome to step away. People \u2014 musicians, sports stars, actors \u2014 have decided to simply call it a day after making a certain amount. It\u2019s other factors that keep Durant in a uniform: he certainly doesn\u2019t need any more money.\n\nBut this is largely a thought exercise. There\u2019s no sense admonishing Durant in any real way, and we can\u2019t live inside his head. He\u2019s welcome to his experience, and at the very least Durant appears like he\u2019s trying to deal with that every day. He\u2019s allowed to be sick of the \u201ccircus\u201d from time-to-time.", "description": "Kevin Durant has said a lot of things this summer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nAFZxGqfv7zkqm07AKF0KQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pcNNcCgurdzPzOGENMw5iQ--~B/aD0xMDM2O3c9MTg0MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/3c80b326021136cc973484d102373662"}
