REUTERS/Francois Lenoir/File Photo\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the incoming president of the EU\u2019s executive, announced last month that Greece\u2019s Margaritis Schinas would be given the title, but it has been sharply criticized and she is under increasing pressure to drop it.\n\nSchinas, a former member of the European Parliament (MEP) and a long-serving Commission official, found himself in the crosshairs of liberal and socialist lawmakers during a three-hour confirmation hearing on Thursday.\n\nKicking off the hearing by Parliament\u2019s committees on civil liberties and justice, and culture and education, Spanish socialist Juan Fernando Lopez Aguilar asked Schinas to explain his future role.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? What does it mean? Because surely, we can agree there\u2019s a European way of life but we need to also agree as to the content,\u201d said Lopez Aguilar, who chairs the civil liberties committee.\n\nDutch liberal Sophia in \u2018t Veld called it a toxic title which has been embraced by the far right.\n\n\u201cThe title needs to go. Full stop. So my advice to you: drop the dog whistle and work with us for the next five years for a European Union that is open and inclusive,\u201d she said.\n\nGerman socialist Birgit Sippel was equally critical.\n\n\u201cYour title plays to the right wing,\u201d she said.\n\nSchinas gave a spirited defense of the title, which he had initially attached to his Twitter profile but has since removed. He now describes himself as Commissioner-designate for migration, security, social rights, education, culture and youth.\n\n\u201cAt its core, being European means protecting the most vulnerable in our societies. It means healthcare and welfare systems that all can access. It means having the same opportunities. It means promoting culture and sport as core elements of our systems,\u201d he said.\n\nParliament will vote on the Commission as a whole on Oct. 23 before it can take office.", "description": "Liberal and socialist lawmakers at the European Parliament called on Thursday for a new title of European Commission Vice President for Protecting our European Way of Life to be scrapped because of its \"toxic\" far-right connotations.", "authors": ["Foo Yun Chee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436852318&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9302A", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
