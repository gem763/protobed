The behind-the-scenes visits at the Columbus Zoo during the Memorial Tournament stand out among his favorite memories as well as the \u201cmusic man\u201d under the big tree on Hilton Head Island.\n\nHe grew up on tournament golf.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Stewart would want to follow in the footsteps of his father, Payne, a three-time major winner and sporting icon. A humble Aaron calls it more of a blessing than an expectation that he\u2019s now back in golf. The former SMU player (just like dad) was recently named vice president of sports marketing for Diamond Resorts and executive director of the LPGA\u2019s Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions.\n\nOct. 25 marks the 20th anniversary of the day Payne\u2019s tragic death played out on television screens across the country. Four months after Payne won the U.S. Open at Pinehurst, a private Learjet carrying the golfer and five others crashed near Aberdeen, South Dakota, after flying on autopilot for several hours.\n\nPayne Stewart at the 1999 Masters.

Imagine trying to control him on Twitter, Chelsea said.\n\n\u201cIt never came from a mean-spirited place,\u201d said Aaron of his father\u2019s jokes. \u201cEverybody knew that\u2019s Payne having a good time. He was able to get away with it.\u201d\n\nAaron, 30, looks a lot like Payne. People tell him that all the time. They also tell stories, and Aaron never tires of hearing them. The Stewart family still keeps in touch with many of the PGA Tour families Aaron and Chelsea grew up with.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got Payne\u2019s charisma,\u201d said Diamond Resorts CEO Mike Flaskey. \u201cHe\u2019s a leader that people want to follow.\u201d\n\nStewart grew up playing golf with Flaskey at Isleworth. After a short stint with the Tavistock Group after college, Stewart became part of the inaugural Diamond Marketing Mentorship Program, a nearly year-long apprenticeship program that takes young professionals around the country and prepares them for marketing leadership positions.\n\n5/29/2014 10:19:55 AM -- Las Vegas -- Aaron Stewart, shown in 2015, was recently named vice president of sports marketing for Diamond Resorts and executive director of the LPGA\u2019s Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions.

Sylvanie, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAfter completing the program, Stewart landed a job that had over 400 employees reporting to him.\n\n\u201cHe was special,\u201d said Flaskey of Stewart taking on such a hefty role at a young age.\n\nAfter several years as National OPC Program Manager and Regional Marketing Director, Stewart and his wife, Naiara, took a break from work to travel the world, an adventure that had long been in the making.\n\nThey visited 40 countries that year, spending the most time visiting family from their mom, Tracey\u2019s, native Australia.\n\nOne of the reasons Flaskey created the Diamond Resorts TOC was to focus on a younger demographic. Millennials account for 12 percent of Diamond\u2019s total membership.\n\n\u201cWe know millennials want to travel,\u201d said Flaskey. \u201cThey want to get out there and go.\u201d\n\nWhen Aaron and his wife returned to the U.S., they decided to move back to Orlando, Florida. He returned to the company in March as Director of National Partnerships.\n\nThe 2020 Diamond Resorts TOC takes place Jan. 16-19 on Tranquilo Golf Course at Four Seasons Golf and Sports Club Orlando. Winners from the last two seasons are invited to play alongside sports stars and celebrities. Eun-Hee Ji won the 2019 edition along with former Atlanta Braves pitcher John Smoltz.\n\nThe tournament, which averaged 15,000 fans over the weekend in its debut, aims to be the biggest party on tour. To that end, there will be three concerts in 2020. While LPGA pros compete for $1.2 million over 72 holes, the celebrities vie for their own $500,000 purse using a modified Stableford format. The event has raised $3.5 million for children\u2019s healthcare.\n\nWith the LPGA adding a second stop in south Florida after the TOC \u2013 the Gainbridge LPGA at Boca Rio \u2013 the field at Tranquilo might be stronger in 2020. Michelle Wie\u2019s victory at the 2018 HSBC Women\u2019s World Championship makes her eligible for the season-opener should be healthy enough to compete.\n\nPart of what attracted Flaskey to bring back a TOC format to the LPGA was the fact that it\u2019s an earned event. In Stewart, he has found a man who is uniquely qualified to lead it.\n\n\u201cWe just think that growing up in a lifetime of golf brings credibility to our event,\u201d said Flaskey of Payne\u2019s only son. \u201cIt helps us really take it to the next level.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s not surprising that Aaron Stewart would want to follow in the footsteps of his father, Payne, a three-time PGA Tour major winner.", "authors": ["Beth Ann Nichols", "Published P.M.
