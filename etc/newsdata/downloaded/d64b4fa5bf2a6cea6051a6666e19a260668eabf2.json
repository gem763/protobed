Or \u2026 is he deliberately misleading the public about this because he knows O\u2019Rourke\u2019s \u201ctake the guns\u201d plea is a political calamity for gun-control and for the party?\n\nAsked about @realDonaldTrump blaming @BetoORourke's gun removal comments for making it harder to pass gun control, @SenSchumer says: \"I don\u2019t know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O\u2019Rourke, but it\u2019s no excuse not to go forward.\" \u2014 Justin Murphy (@CitizenMurphy) September 18, 2019\n\nWhen he says \u201cany other Democrat,\u201d does he mean any other Democrat *in Congress* or any other Democrat anywhere? Because each of those claims is a lie even if you exclude Booker and Harris. The Squad hasn\u2019t spoken up about Beto\u2019s plan yet, likely because they don\u2019t want to risk giving his candidacy a boost with progressives that might undermine Bernie or Warren, but I\u2019d bet good money that they\u2019re all aboard with a mandatory buyback. How could they not be? Their politics is to take the maximalist left-wing position on every issue. That\u2019s what Beto did.\n\nIf Schumer meant Democratic voters generally, well\u2026\n\nSupporting confiscation is a safe-ish issue in very blue jurisdictions. In a national campaign with a purplish electorate, it\u2019s not so safe, as O\u2019Rourke is discovering. In a red state it\u2019s political poison, of course, which explains why Joe Manchin from West Virginia sounds like he wants to fight Beto:\n\n\u201cBeto\u2019s one human being,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cHe gave his own opinion, OK? I think it was very harmful to make it look like all the Democrats. I can tell you one thing: Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s not taking my guns away from me. You tell Beto that OK?\u201d\n\nEh. If Beto\u2019s stunt at last week\u2019s debate didn\u2019t kill off the gun-control talks in Congress, Trump\u2019s squeamishness about committing to anything would have. The Times has an update on that mysterious background-check proposal Bill Barr was shopping around on Capitol Hill yesterday. It came from the White House, yet Trump aides were adamant in telling reporters that the president hadn\u2019t signed off on it or anything else. It was, in other words, a pure trial balloon, likely aimed at gauging how the right-most side of the Republican caucus would react to it. Answer: Not well.\n\nRepublicans who favor gun rights said they wanted more specifics, and several said it was pointless to even talk about Mr. Barr\u2019s plan at this point. As the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer, the attorney general will be a central figure in the debate over gun legislation, but senators agree that the president will have the final say. \u201cMy question was: \u2018Where is the president on this?\u2019 And I asked this question directly: \u2018Is this something the president supports?\u2019 And they didn\u2019t have an answer for that,\u201d said Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, who met with Mr. Barr on Tuesday evening. \u201cThat\u2019s an important piece. If the president doesn\u2019t support it, then there\u2019s no point.\u201d And Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, who also met with Mr. Barr on Tuesday evening, warned against any legislation that \u201craised the specter of confiscation\u201d and said he was not interested in a bill that would \u201crestrict the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.\u201d\n\nSo, yeah, it\u2019s not happening. Trump could almost certainly get the bill passed over Hawley\u2019s and Cruz\u2019s objections if he endorsed it but then he\u2019d have other prominent Republican pols to his right on a nuclear-hot cultural issue. And that\u2019s an uncomfortable place for President Populist to be.\n\nHere\u2019s Beto yesterday on CNN doing a little damage control by emphasizing that only \u201cweapons of war\u201d would be confiscated under his administration, not weapons designed for self-defense. That plan would last about five seconds after it was implemented, of course, as Democrats quickly realized that confiscating assault rifles will do next to nothing to reduce total gun violence in the United States.", "description": "What?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Hot Air Staff", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
