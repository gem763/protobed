They should inspire us to achieve the things that are just beyond our reach. Decarbonizing our national electricity grid is a worthy aspiration, and getting there is attainable. But, while solar, wind and battery storage may grab the headlines, a simple truth is often overlooked \u2013 we can\u2019t achieve deep decarbonization of our electricity system without hydropower.\n\nWhy? Because hydropower is the nation\u2019s first renewable resource, providing clean, carbon-free energy to roughly 30 million Americans, and 40 percent of the United States\u2019 overall renewable electricity. In addition, hydropower is flexible enough to integrate increasing amounts of wind and solar onto the grid. That flexibility allows it to quickly provide dispatchable generation to balance the minute-by-minute electricity generation variations caused by cloud cover, wind gusts, or fuel-supply disruptions from non-renewable resources.\n\nIn addition to 80 GWs of traditional hydropower, the U.S. electricity system also benefits from 23 GWs of pumped storage. Representing 95 percent of the nation\u2019s energy storage, pumped storage hydropower facilities are like sponges; they absorb excess energy from the grid and store it for later. All of which is to say, hydropower is the renewable resource that integrates the other renewables.\n\nNevertheless, hydropower too often gets ignored on the federal and the state levels. This neglect, however, is not benign. In fact, it may hinder the nation\u2019s efforts to achieve a carbon-free grid.\n\nReaching a 100 percent clean energy target is a moonshot that states throughout the country are increasingly attempting. Some states understand the value of hydropower\u2019s contribution. Washington state, for example, passed legislation requiring 100 percent clean electricity by 2045. The bill allows all existing hydropower generation to be used for compliance, and for hydropower to generate renewable energy credits.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, California\u2019s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) only counts hydropower projects under 30 megawatts as an eligible renewable or zero emission energy source. This is despite the fact that hydropower generated nearly 13 percent of the state's total power. The absence of hydropower from California\u2019s RPS runs counter to its need for energy storage. In 2016, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory determined that for California to reach 50 percent solar, it would need another 15 gigawatts of storage by 2030. The need for more pumped storage hydropower couldn\u2019t be more glaring.\n\nCalifornia isn\u2019t alone. The vast majority of states with RPSs do not treat hydropower equally with other carbon-free resources.\n\nUnfortunately, what\u2019s happening in the states is being mirrored here in Washington, D.C. Regardless of your thoughts on the Green New Deal, the fact that hydropower was not even mentioned is striking. At the same time, it isn\u2019t being discussed as a clean energy solution by the environmental community, or touted as a mature investment opportunity by Wall Street. From Congress to think tanks, from the campaign trail to national climate organizations, the omission of hydropower is at best short-sided.\n\nStill no other energy source protects and preserves our natural ecosystems, while providing recreational opportunities for families, like hydro. Also, hydropower can be a cost-effective asset, with low variable operation and maintenance costs that can stabilize future prices for ratepayers. Upfront costs are high, but its value extends 50 years and beyond.\n\nMeanwhile, many exciting innovations within the industry are happening. We are exploring floating solar panels on reservoirs, pairing conventional hydro facilities with battery storage, and developing next generation fish passage technologies like Whooshh Innovations. Also, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, there is great potential to sustainably add nearly 5 gigawatts of generation to existing, non-powered dams.\n\nPolicy makers from both sides of the aisle should recognize what hydropower brings to the table, and look for ways to support the industry. A great place to start is to provide parity in tax incentives and environmental markets.\n\nUnlike other technologies, federal tax credits to encourage hydropower development were allowed to \u201csunset\u201d in 2015, putting it at a competitive disadvantage. And just as nonsensical, most state laws exclude hydropower from receiving the renewable energy credits that have helped drive the growth of the wind and solar industries.\n\nAt the same time, we must protect our existing hydro assets. Red-tape and bureaucratic infighting between federal and state regulators has resulted in dozens of hydropower relicensing proceedings dragging on for well over a decade.\n\nHydropower deserves far greater attention in the nation\u2019s energy and climate policy debates. Like all forms of energy technology, it is not a perfect solution in all circumstances. Yet, it is critical to the vitality of the nation\u2019s clean energy and carbon-free future.\n\nHydropower needs more than a fresh look. It deserves a seat at the table.\n\nMalcolm Woolf is the president and CEO of the National Hydropower Association.", "description": "Hydropower deserves far greater attention in the nation\u2019s energy and climate policy debates.
