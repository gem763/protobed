She travels with schoolfriends Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana. The three intend to meet another friend, Sharmeena Begum \u2013 no relation of Shamima \u2013 who had travelled to Syria in late 2014. CCTV footage shows the girls walking through Gatwick airport, where they boarded a flight to Turkey. There they are picked up by smugglers and taken across the border to an Isis base in northern Syria. Once there they move into a women\u2019s house in Raqqa and apply to marry. July 2015 The families of the girls say that two of them have married Isis fighters, without disclosing which. They say they are distraught at the news. It later emerges that Begum had married 27-year-old Yago Riedijk, an Isis fighter from the Netherlands, 10 days after arriving in Raqqa. Soon afterwards she became pregnant with her first child, a daughter named Sarayah. July 2016 Abase marries an 18-year-old Australian jihadist, Abdullah Elmir. He was later reported by intelligence agencies to have been killed by a coalition airstrike. August 2016 Sultana\u2019s family say that they believe she had been killed in an airstrike in Raqqa in May 2016. January 2017 Begum and her family flee Raqqa as Isis retreats and head south-east to the town of Mayadin. She has another child, a son called Jerah. Later, the family moves again as Isis is pushed back. June 2018 Begum sees her two surviving classmates, Sharmeena Begum and Abase, for the last time. Late 2018 Jerah dies, aged eight months, of malnutrition and an unknown illness. Her daughter dies soon after, aged one year and nine months. February 2019 Begum, who is heavily pregnant, gives an interview to the Times, in which she says that she should be allowed to return to the UK to raise her unborn third child. She gives birth a few days later. The Home Office tells her family that her citizenship will be revoked. March 2019 Jarrah, Begum's new born son, dies in a Syrian refugee camp. The child was three weeks old.\n\nPhotograph: POOL New/X80003\n\n\u201cEven if her appeal succeeds it could not result in her return,\u201d he said. \u201cHer treatment is the same as British citizens who have not been deprived.\u201d\n\nGlasson said the government accepted that the situation in Syria was \u201cfluid and volatile\u201d and Begum could not give live evidence or make a witness statement.\n\nBut he said that should not prevent the home secretary from removing her citizenship, adding: \u201cThe more committed and extreme an individual is, the more likely they would find themselves in a situation where they were less able to participate in proceedings and so less likely to be the subject of deprivation and that cannot possibly be right.\u201d\n\nBegum left Britain in February 2015 when she was 15, with two friends from the Bethnal Green academy in east London, using her older sister\u2019s passport.\n\nIn Syria, Begum married an Isis fighter and the couple had three children, all of whom died of disease or malnutrition, the last in a prison camp in northern Syria.\n\nShe was stripped of her British citizenship on the grounds of national security in February, amid a political row over whether she was a dual British and Bangladeshi citizen.\n\nBut under UN conventions signed after the second world war, making a person stateless is unlawful.\n\nNow in the Roj camp, Begum has appealed to come home, saying: \u201cI hate the Dawla [Isis] so much.\u201d\n\nThe Siac hearing continues. Judgment is likely to be reserved.", "description": "Revelation during Shamima Begum\u2019s citizenship appeal contradicts official statements", "authors": ["Duncan Gardham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/167fb9082dc6fb85459513afbd0524811dde7c69/80_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8d45d3efa23696bb89994d8bcfb0ff9a", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
