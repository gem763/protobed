REUTERS/Kevin Lam\n\nThe cost of installing solar power has become more competitive with the use of fossil fuels, making it more attractive as an energy source to reduce pollution and meet emission targets.\n\n\u201cWe are now faced with new and urgent challenges in climate change,\u201d Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing said at Singapore International Energy Week on Tuesday.\n\nSingapore, a low-lying country, is vulnerable to rising sea levels while its weather has also become hotter and rainfalls are heavier due to the effects of climate change, he added.\n\n\u201cHowever, Singapore has few alternative energy options. We have limited land area, no hydro or geothermal resources and low wind speeds,\u201d Chan said.\n\nTo address these challenges, Singapore aims to widen the use of solar power in the city state, targeting at least 2-gigawatt (GW) peak of solar power capacity by 2030, which is equivalent to more than 10% of the country\u2019s peak electricity demand today, he said.\n\nBesides putting more solar panels on buildings, Singapore plans to double the capacity of floating solar modules in Singapore\u2019s water reservoirs from current plans of around a 160 megawatt (MW) peak and develop solutions such as integrating solar panels on vertical surfaces of buildings, Chan said.\n\nThe city state also plans to deploy 200 MW of energy storage systems (ESS) beyond 2025 to augment solar power generation, he said.\n\n\u201cOver the next 10 years, we expect solar with ESS to reach cost-parity with current gas turbines,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, he added that natural gas will continue to be the dominant fuel for Singapore in the near future due to the time needed to scale up alternative sources for power generation.\n\nSingapore plans to diversify the sources of natural gas into the country and it will continue to develop its role as a trading hub for liquefied natural gas (LNG), Chan said.\n\nThe country is also studying plans to build a second LNG import terminal and will look at issuing more import licences, he added.", "description": "Natural gas will continue to play a dominant role in generating electricity in Singapore while the state plans to accelerate the use of renewable energy, primarily solar power, in the next decade to battle climate change, a senior government official said.", "authors": ["Roslan Khasawneh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446052565&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S05N", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
