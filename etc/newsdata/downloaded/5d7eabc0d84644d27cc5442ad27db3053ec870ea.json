(\u201cHinterland\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) announces that it has entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Molecular Science Corp. (\u201cMolecular Science\u201d) in respect of a transaction pursuant to which Molecular Science and its shareholders will complete a business combination with Hinterland (the \u201cTransaction\u201d). Upon completion of the Transaction, the combined entity (the \u201cResulting Issuer\u201d) will continue to carry on the business of Molecular Science as currently constituted. The Transaction is an arm\u2019s length transaction and will constitute a reverse takeover of Hinterland by Molecular Science. Hinterland is a reporting issuer in British Columbia, Alberta and Quebec and does not currently trade on any stock exchange in Canada. The Transaction is subject to, among other things, the entering into of a binding definitive agreement (the \u201cDefinitive Agreement\u201d) between the parties setting out the terms and conditions of the Transaction.\n\nMolecular Science an analytical chemistry services company focused on the Canadian cannabis market. Its services include testing of cannabis and related products in its licensed laboratory for release to market and research purposes, analysis of product profiles for specific medical indications and product positioning, R&D related to specific cannabis-derived compounds and a mobile laboratory service for on-site sampling and testing at client cultivation and processing operations.\n\nMolecular Science has a 3,600 square foot laboratory located in Toronto, Ontario that boasts state-of-the-art infrastructure and instrumentation for complete cannabis quality testing \u2013 potency, pesticides, metals, solvents, microbial toxins, terpenes and moisture, with microbial testing conducted by MSC partner labs. The Molecular Science lab was constructed and operates according to pharmaceutical GMP and ISO standards, and is staffed by experienced QC and QA professionals with backgrounds in the pharmaceutical and analytical technology industries. The company\u2019s product specific test methods (flower, oil, resin, edibles, beverages, etc.) and in-licensed technology to predict potential matrix effects on mass spectrometry methods enable Molecular Science to provide highly accurate and reliable test results.\n\nThe Molecular Science mobile laboratory is a self-contained unit that provides on-site, same-day testing (such as potency and pesticides) to growers and processors. It is operated by Molecular Science scientific personnel in accordance with the company\u2019s quality assurance policies. The mobile laboratory gives Molecular Science a national presence and direct contact with its clients\u2019 operations.\n\nIn conjunction with the Transaction, Molecular Science intends to complete, on or prior to the completion of the Transaction, a private placement (the \u201cFinancing\u201d) of subscription receipts (the \u201cSubscription Receipts\u201d) for aggregate gross proceeds of not less than CDN $3 million. The Subscription Receipts are expected to be converted into units (the \u201cUnits\u201d) comprised of $1,000 principal amount convertible debentures and warrants to acquire common shares of Molecular Science. The gross proceeds of the Financing will be held in escrow (the \u201cEscrowed Proceeds\u201d) pending satisfaction of certain conditions (the \u201cEscrow Release Conditions\u201d). The Escrow Release Conditions will include the satisfaction of all necessary or required matters relating to the Transaction, and the receipt of conditional approval for trading on a stock exchange acceptable to Molecular Science in respect of the common shares of the Resulting Issuer. Upon satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, it is expect that each Subscription Receipt will be automatically converted into the Units, and the Escrowed Proceeds shall be released from escrow. Upon completion of the Transaction, all securities of Molecular Science, including those issuable upon conversion of the Subscription Receipts, will be exchanged (or exchangeable) for equivalent securities of the Resulting Issuer on the basis of the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) subject to the receipt of tax, corporate and securities laws advice. The net proceeds of the Financing will be used by the Resulting Issuer for expansion of its laboratory operations in Canada, addition of new analytical services, expansion of its R&D program, and for working capital and general corporate purposes. There can be no assurances that the Financing will be completed on the terms set out above, or at all.\n\nThe Transaction\n\nIt is intended that the Transaction will result in Molecular Science becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hinterland or otherwise combining its corporate existence with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hinterland. While the final structure of the Transaction will be subject to the receipt of tax, corporate and securities law advice for both Hinterland and Molecular Science, it is currently anticipated that the Transaction will be completed by way of a \u201cthree-cornered amalgamation\u201d, whereby:\n\nMolecular Science will amalgamate with a newly-incorporated wholly-owned subsidiary of Hinterland;\n\n\n\nthe holders of common shares of Molecular Science will receive that number of post-Consolidation (as defined below) Resulting Issuer common shares based on the Exchange Ratio;\n\n\n\nall of the outstanding stock options and share purchase warrants of Molecular Science will be exchanged for options and warrants of Hinterland, pursuant to the amalgamation; and\n\n\n\nall debenture and warrants of Molecular Science issuable upon conversion of the Subscription Receipts will be exchanged for debentures and warrants of Hinterland after the amalgamation, subject to any tax or securities laws structuring.\n\nFor purposes of the Transaction, the parties have agreed that the aggregate value of the issued and outstanding common shares of Hinterland shall have a deemed value of $1,250,000 (the \u201cHinterland Value\u201d). The parties have further agreed that the aggregate value of the issued and outstanding securities of Molecular Science have a value of $24,586,648.75 on a \u201cpre-money\u201d and undiluted basis. Accordingly, prior to the completion of the Financing, it is currently expected that holders of Molecular Science common shares will hold approximately 95.16% of the share of the Resulting Issuer (the \u201cExchange Ratio\u201d). Subsequent news releases in respect of the Transaction will provide updates in this regard.\n\nThe Company intends to seek the approval of its shareholders for the Transaction at a special meeting of shareholders (the \u201cMeeting\u201d), which is expected to be held in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020 or such other date as the Company and Molecular Science may determine.\n\nHinterland has agreed that its liabilities on closing of the Transaction shall be limited a total of $60,000. Prior to the execution of the Definitive Agreement, it may conduct certain securities-based transactions, with the consent of Molecular Science, in order to ensure its liabilities are within such limit (the \u201cHinterland Reorganization\u201d). The Hinterland Reorganization will not affect the Hinterland Value.\n\nAt the Meeting to be held in connection with the Transaction, the shareholders of the Company may be asked to approve a special resolution authorizing an amendment to the articles of Hinterland to consolidate the issued and outstanding common share capital at a ratio to be determined (the \u201cConsolidation\u201d) and to change the name of the Company to \u201cMolecular Science Corp\u201d or such other name as may be acceptable to Molecular Science. Other than the Hinterland Reorganization, the Consolidation and the shares issuable pursuant to the Transaction (including the shares issuable to investors in connection with the Financing), it is not expected that the Company\u2019s share capital will be altered as a result of the Transaction.\n\nClosing Conditions\n\nCompletion of the Transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including but not limited to completion of the Financing, the satisfaction of the Company and Molecular Science in respect of the due diligence investigations to be undertaken by each party, the entering into by the parties of the Definitive Agreement with respect to the Transaction (which shall include such representations, warranties, conditions and covenants typical for a transaction of this nature), the receipt of all necessary corporate approvals of each of Hinterland and Molecular Science, the determination of a new board of directors of the Resulting Issuer (to consist of directors nominated by Molecular Science, in its sole discretion), the receipt of approval of the shareholders of Hinterland at the Meeting, the receipt of approval of the shareholders of Molecular Science and the receipt of all necessary approvals of all regulatory bodies having jurisdiction in connection with the Transaction, including stock exchange approvals. The Transaction cannot close until the required conditions are satisfied or waived, and there can be no assurances that the Transaction will be completed as proposed or at all.\n\nInvestors are cautioned that, except as disclosed in a disclosure document of Hinterland or the Resulting Issuer to be prepared in connection with the Transaction, any information released or received with respect to the Transaction including the Financing, and/or other associated transactions may not be accurate or complete and should not be relied upon. Trading in the securities of the Company should be considered highly speculative.\n\nIf and when the Definitive Agreement between Hinterland and Molecular Science is executed, Hinterland will issue a subsequent press release in accordance with the policies of any applicable stock exchange containing the details of the Definitive Agreement and certain additional terms of the Transaction.\n\nCautionary Statements\n\nDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements: This press release contains certain \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d within the meaning of applicable securities legislation relating to the proposal to complete the Transaction and associated transactions, including statements regarding the terms and conditions of the Transaction, the Financing, and the use of proceeds of the Financing.
