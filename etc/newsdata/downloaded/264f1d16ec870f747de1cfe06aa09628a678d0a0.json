Before the news, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials were in positive territory.\n\nFor months, Wall Street has bounced up and down with signs of improvement or deterioration in trade talks, often based on comments or tweets from Trump, a cycle investors have grown accustomed to.\n\n\"In this case, it's a bit more concerning because it's China making the decision, rather than Trump,\" said Willie Delwiche, markets strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.\n\nTrade optimism in recent weeks helped elevate the S&P 500 to just shy of its all-time high hit in July.\n\nEight of the 11 major S&P sectors fell on Friday. The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index and tariff-sensitive S&P 500 information technology index declined the most, down 1.2% and 1.1%, respectively. The Philadelphia chip index slid 1.8%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.59% to end the week at 26,934.46 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.49% to 2,991.99.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.8% to 8,117.67.\n\nFor the week, the S&P 500 fell 0.52%, the Dow lost 1.05% and the Nasdaq declined 0.72%.\n\nNetflix tumbled 5.5% after CEO Reed Hastings made comments underscoring growing costs and rising competition from Walt Disney (NYSE: ) Co DIS.N , Apple Inc and other video streaming services. to Netflix's woes, Evercore ISI said recent data painted an uncertain picture of the company's international subscriber growth.\n\nThe S&P 500 healthcare index , which has been the worst performing S&P sector this year, clocked the biggest gain among the 11 major sectors, up 0.6%.\n\nMerck (NS: ) & Co MRK.N gained 1.4% after the company's drugs Pifeltro and Delstrigo received FDA approval for use in certain adult patients with HIV-1 who are \"virally suppressed.\"\n\nRoku Inc slumped 19.2% after Pivotal Research started coverage of its shares with a \"sell\" rating.\n\nXilinx Inc dropped 6.8% after Chief Financial Officer Lorenzo Flores said he would step down, prompting Bank of America (NYSE: ) Merrill to downgrade the chipmaker to \"neutral.\"\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 47 new highs and 51 new lows.\n\nWith investors unwinding positions in futures and options contracts before they expire, volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.8 billion shares, compared with a 7.1 billion-share average over the last 20 trading days.", "description": "US STOCKS-Wall Street drops after China cancels trip to Montana farmland", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB59082_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
