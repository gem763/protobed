In Asia, Japan's Nikkei was down 2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed up 0.3%. Stock markets in China and South Korea were closed on Thursday.\n\nA weak U.S. private-sector jobs report on Wednesday and a plan by the Trump administration to impose tariffs on goods from the EU reignited fears about a global economic downturn. Figures on Tuesday also showed U.S. factory activity falling to its lowest level in over a decade.\n\n\"There seems to be some cracks forming in some parts of the U.S. economy and also in investor confidence,\" said Margaret Yang, a market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore.\n\nThe yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys dropped to 1.579% on Thursday, from 1.594% on Wednesday.
