And the best bit is, you could watch it completely free.\n\nDirected by Ken Loach, Sorry We Missed You speaks from the heart of modern day Britain. From those living on the brink of zero-hour contracts, tireless service economies and family strains.\n\nThese contemporary issues will be brought to life on the silver screen on November 1 \u2013 and it's a film we feel everyone should see. So we\u2019re giving you the opportunity to attend a special screening next Tuesday, October 15.\n\nYou\u2019ll get to view it before it hits the cinemas by claiming a free ticket to one of our screenings. Just remember to act fast, as tickets are on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nWHAT'S IT ABOUT?\n\nThe story follows Ricky and his family enduring an uphill battle following the 2008 financial crash.\n\nAs a delivery worker, Ricky is driven to the edge suffering long hours and minimal benefits, just like his wife, Abbie, a contract nurse.\n\nBoth workloads place immense strain on their family life and the film shares a heartwarming look at human sacrifice in times of economic and political upheaval.\n\nHOW TO CLAIM YOUR TICKETS\n\nTo receive a pair of tickets, log onto seeitfirst.com and simply follow the instructions.\n\nYou'll also be able to find your nearest screening on the website.\n\nProvided there are seats available at your chosen cinema, you\u2019ll be able to print off a pair of tickets to take along on the night.
