Apple also revealed it will give iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and Mac customers a free one-year trial of the service. Apple TV+ will launch with nine original titles.\n\nThe price falls well under Netflix's offerings, which start at $8.99 per month for a \"Basic\" plan and hit $15.99 per month for its top-tier service.\n\nHowever, the streaming company's collection of more than 400 original series titles will keep it from losing too much market share to Apple, the analysts said. The note also cited SNL Kagan data showing nearly 4,000 movies and 1,828 series available on Netflix.\n\nApple is \"likely to be hit-driven in the near term\" while Netflix continues to produce series well-known among consumers, the analysts wrote.\n\n\"Until Apple's content library gains scale to compare to Netflix or Amazon, it is likely as a nice-to-have for Apple device users/buyers and no substitute for Netflix's large catalog of licensed content and originals,\" the team led by Nat Schindler said in the note.\n\nMarkets Insider is looking for a panel of millennial investors.

The company's 157 million streaming subscribers give it a healthy lead over looming competition, with Disney's service also not launching until November.\n\nNetflix shares have fallen nearly 18% in the last three months as subscriber growth slowed and its second-quarter earnings disappointed analysts. Bank of America reiterated its \"buy\" rating Tuesday, and pegged its price objective for the Netflix stock at $450 per share.\n\nThe streaming company traded at $290.11 per share as of 1:30 p.m. ET Wednesday, up about 8% year-to-date.\n\nNetflix has 31 \"buy\" ratings, nine \"hold\" ratings, and four \"sell\" ratings from analysts, with a consensus price target of $386.51, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nApple hits 11-month highs after its latest keynote reveals competitive streaming pricing and a new iPhone lineup\n\n'Big Short' legend Michael Burry recently unveiled a bullish bet on GameStop \u2014 but the retailer's shares are plummeting after a dismal earnings report\n\nA 21-year-old college YouTuber who has worked with brands like Amazon and Sephora shares her advice for starting an influencer career", "description": "Netflix will remain a leader in the streaming wars despite Apple TV+ offering a far lower price, Bank of America analysts said Tuesday.
