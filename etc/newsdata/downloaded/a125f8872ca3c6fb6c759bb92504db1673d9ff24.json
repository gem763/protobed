At first, the Trump administration suggested the attack might have been a \u201cfake hate crime\u201d perpetrated by \u201cthe left.\u201d Then three members of a Trump-supporting militia were arrested in the attack. They\u2019d tried to throw a pipe bomb into the room where Omar was standing. They\u2019d missed.\n\nSo when President Donald Trump held a campaign rally in nearby Minneapolis on Thursday night, some local Muslims were on edge. \u201cIt\u2019s a fear in the neighborhood, like if a predator came to the neighborhood and no one told you,\u201d Omar told The Daily Beast on Friday. \u201c\u2018What\u2019s going to happen, what\u2019s he going to say, how is it going to affect us?\u2019 It is not only what he\u2019s saying, but it\u2019s also the people who make it into an action.\u201d\n\nDuring his Thursday rally, Trump laid into the area\u2019s Somali population: a predominantly black, Muslim community that has become a target for Islamophobes across the country. Trump criticized Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), the Somali-American congress member who represents the district, and spoke of giving (presumably non-Somali) locals more control to block refugees from their communities. Trump\u2019s audience booed at the mention of their Somali neighbors.\n\nTrump\u2019s language at these rallies isn\u2019t just insulting\u2014it\u2019s outright dangerous to Minnesota Muslims, said Scott Simpson, public advocacy director for the group Muslim Advocates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for us to look at the rally last night outside of the context of the Bloomington mosque bombing that happened in 2017,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cThat event was tragic for that community. Thankfully no one died in it. It\u2019s a story that is not understood enough or talked about enough, but it typifies how vulnerable and resilient this community has had to be.\u201d\n\nMinnesota\u2019s Somali community is the largest in the country and, perhaps as a result, the subject of some of the most vicious fear-mongering.\n\nLess than a month ago, Minneapolis police arrested a man for smashing windows at Somali-owned businesses. Harlin St. John, 36, reportedly told investigators that he hated \u201cthe Somalis.\u201d In May, a rash of conservative news sites falsely claimed a gang of Somali youths were beating white people with hammers (the hoax originated from a disorderly conduct arrest of two minors who were waving pipes at each other). In June, The New York Times profiled a Minnesota town where white locals bemoaned that Somali immigrants weren\u2019t coming \u201cfrom Norway\u201d and that these new neighbors were engaging in offensive behavior like \u201cwalking around.\u201d\n\nTrump campaigned on some of these grievances. Shortly before his election in 2016, he told a crowd that \u201chere in Minnesota you have seen firsthand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state, without your knowledge, without your support or approval [...] You\u2019ve suffered enough in Minnesota.\u201d\n\nTrump and his followers have also led sustained criticism of Rep. Omar, who \u201cacts like a vessel for these attacks\u201d on Somalis and Muslims, Simpson said. \u201cThe presumption is that the Somali-American community isn\u2019t loyal to America, they don\u2019t believe in the Constitution, they\u2019re pro-terrorist. These are myths that unfortunately weigh down on the psyche of these communities.\u201d\n\nWhile anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiment existed before Trump\u2019s first campaign, \u201cwhen the candidate Donald Trump came in 2016 in Minnesota, that was the time it became real,\u201d Mohamed Omar said. \u201cIt spiked, it exploded. The hatred, the movement that was doing all those things, now they have a leader they can look up to.\u201d\n\nDuring this period, his mosque became a national target after some neighbors wrote anonymous blog posts about it, he said. \u201cThose groups write something about us and they connect with the national white supremacist network. That\u2019s how our name came out.\u201d\n\nThose digital whispers reached an Illinois vigilante group. The conspiratorial network, which also attempted to sell fake currency, bomb a women\u2019s health clinic, rob Walmarts, and ransom a set of railroad tracks, drove more than 500 miles to Dar Al-Farooq, where they hoped to \u201cscare [Muslims] out of the country,\u201d according to criminal filings, \u201cshow them hey, you\u2019re not welcome here, get the fuck out.\u201d Two of the three men arrested have pleaded guilty to the 2017 attack. Another, allegedly the ringleader, has pleaded not guilty.\n\nOmar said the group was a product of \u201cthe environment of divisiveness and hatred\u201d Trump has created. \u201cThe terrorists who attacked us, who were that close to killing me, did not just come from nowhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were not just isolated guys, not just psychos who wanted to do something crazy. They were an organized hate group.\u201d\n\nThe White House\u2019s response to the attack did not deter bigots, Simpson said.\n\n\u201cIf this were any other house of worship or any other president, the president or the administration would either say nothing or they would be denouncing something like this. This is the bombing of a house of worship on United States soil,\u201d he said, noting that then-National Security Adviser Sebastian Gorka suggested the attack was a hoax. \u201cIf I were a militia member attacking a mosque, if I ever needed a clearer signal from the White House that there would be excuses made on my behalf, that statement from the White House would be it.\u201d\n\nThe White House never apologized for the comments. Since then, the attacks on Dar Al-Farooq have continued. A conspiratorial website now accuses the mosque of being a terror hub, and takes pictures and videos of worshippers\u2014including children\u2014as they enter the building, MPR News reported this month.\n\n\u201cEither they attack you with a bomb or they attack you with a camera,\u201d Omar said. \u201cThey\u2019re taking pictures of innocent children who have no idea what\u2019s going on in adults\u2019 lives, who just want to have recess on the playground and some guy comes and takes a picture.\u201d\n\nIn advance of Trump\u2019s Thursday rally, where at least one right-wing militia called for armed men to act as a vigilante guard force, members of Omar\u2019s mosque community worried about renewed physical violence.\n\n\u201cWe were really afraid that this visit, that maybe somebody would come and do something to us,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the end, the physical attacks never came\u2014just the rhetoric that has inflamed past incidents.\n\nOmar said he wished the crowd that had booed at the mention of Somalis would take the time to meet his community.\n\n\u201cGet to know us rather than listen to someone who is trying to score political points and making our neighborhood toxic,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who follow Trump and go to his rallies: please, our children are the same as your children.\u201d", "description": "\u201cWe were really afraid that this visit, that maybe somebody would come and do something to us,\u201d Mohamed Omar said of Trump\u2019s campaign rally in Minneapolis Thursday night.", "authors": ["Kelly Weill"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2942,w_5231,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570830836/RTS2QJQ2_pzauv2", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
