(Photo: John Locher/AP)\n\nA call to \u201cstorm\u201d the secretive military base in the Nevada desert known as Area 51 attracted several dozen revelers to a heavily guarded entrance early Friday, but most did not attempt to enter the site, which has long been rumored to house secrets about extraterrestrial life.\n\nA festive scene emerged around 3 a.m. PT on Friday, the date and time a Facebook user had jokingly invited people to run into the base on foot to \u201csee them aliens.\u201d Among the UFO enthusiasts and curiosity seekers, one man wore an orange spacesuit and some sported tinfoil hats and alien masks. A sign in the gathering read \u201cSave ET from the government.\u201d\n\n\u201cA bunch of random people in weird costumes standing outside of a government base, why would you want to miss that?\u201d said a YouTube personality who goes by the name Atozy. \u201cThat\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\u201d\n\nA man takes a picture of a sign at the Little A'Le'Inn on Thursday during an event inspired by the \"Storm Area 51\" internet hoax.

Others stayed outside the perimeter, according to law enforcement officials keeping watch over the crowd.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just here to see what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Sgt. Orlando Guerra of the Nevada Department of Public Safety Investigation Division. \u201cThey\u2019re here to have fun.\u201d\n\nThe Air Force had issued a stern warning to the public not to trespass into Area 51, which it said is used to test aircraft and train personnel.\n\nJason Strand said he had traveled from Utah to the rural Nevada site as part of a group of nine friends to take in the scene. He said he was not inclined to dart into Area 51.\n\n\u201cWe came out here to see the dumb people make a run for it,\u201d he said.\n\nArea 51 had long been shrouded in mystery, stoking conspiracy theories that it housed the remnants of a flying saucer and the bodies of its alien crew from a supposed UFO crash in Roswell, N.M., in 1947.\n\nThe U.S. government did not confirm that the base existed until 2013, when it released CIA archives saying the site was used to test top-secret spy planes.\n\nA bus arrives for a 'Storm Area 51' spinoff event on Sept. 20, 2019 in Rachel, Nevada.

Some residents had urged the public to stay away because they worried that the town of 50 year-round residents would be overwhelmed with unruly tourists.\n\nAs of early Friday, a few hundred campsites had been set up by visitors outside the Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn, an alien-themed motel and restaurant that is Rachel\u2019s only business.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m relieved it\u2019s here,\u201d said Connie West, co-owner of the inn, who had scrambled to set up a campground, bring in portable toilets and otherwise support the influx of visitors. \u201cIt\u2019s happening. There was no stopping it.\u201d (Reuters)\n\nSee more news-related photo galleries and follow us on Yahoo News Photo Twitter and Tumblr.", "description": "A call to \u201cstorm\u201d the secretive military base in Nevada known as Area 51 attracted revelers to a heavily guarded entrance early Friday, but most did not attempt to enter the site, which has long been rumored to house secrets about extraterrestrial life.", "authors": ["Yahoo News Photo Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0X8A6Snok0EaMV8DhPqWMQ--~B/aD0yODA5O3c9NDIxMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/afa82470-dbb0-11e9-b7f6-66b2839eb170", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
