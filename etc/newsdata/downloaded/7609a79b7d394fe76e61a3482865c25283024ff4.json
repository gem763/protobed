Convinced that people are the problem, in all our forms, abortion is now emerging as a \u201csolution\u201d to climate change, pushed forward in at atmosphere of fear.\n\nThe anti-child movement being developed, named things like #NoFutureNoChildren, equates population control with climate control, making the answer to the world\u2019s problems a reduction in the number of people. As I travel across the country speaking to college and university student groups as head of Students for Life of America, I hear this often as earnest and fearful students say that they are not going to have children, while others fret about children enduring a \u201cpost-apocalyptic Mad Max hell scape.\u201d\n\nCelebrities add to this tension. Prince Harry recently said he and his celebrity wife would only have two children because of climate concerns. Speaking to Elle magazine, Miley Cyrus said, \u201cWe\u2019re getting handed a piece-of-shit planet, and I refuse to hand that down to my child. Until I feel like my kid would live on an earth with fish in the water, I\u2019m not bringing in another person to deal with that.\u201d\n\nBritish musician Blythe Pepino founded \u201cBirthStrike\u201d because of her fears for the environment, even though she told CNN, \u201cI really want a kid \u2026 I am in a position to be an activist. It\u2019s a stronger calling than motherhood, even though I still mourn the idea.\u201d\n\nAnd when the elite get together at the highest levels, using government to control outcomes comes next. Case in point, Sen. Bernie Sanders, who turns a jaundiced eye toward his fellow humans.\n\nAt a CNN event, Mr. Sanders praised the abortion lobby in the U.S. that allows the procedure through all nine months of pregnancy, for any reason at all, and sometimes with taxpayer funding. But worldwide abortion is the thing we really need to change the temperature, he indicated, \u201cespecially in poor countries around the world.\u201d\n\nFollowing that thinking, will an income test become law before people can attempt a child? It seems a one-percenter kind of arrogance to assume that money means someone is better suited to parenthood.\n\nDisrespect for human life also leads to all kinds of Hollywood-esque policy conclusions.\n\nStockholm School of Economics professor and researcher Magnus Soderlund has suggested that eating \u201chuman meat\u201d (better known as cannibalism) is a way to reduce gases and create food \u201csustainability\u201d despite the known health risks when eating human flesh.\n\nLate-night movie buffs might remember Oscar-winning Charlton Heston in \u201cSoylent Green,\u201d an apocalyptic horror flick that aired the same year that Roe v. Wade became law, in which food shortages and global unrest were to be soothed with \u201cSoylent Green,\u201d a sustainable protein source that was supposed to be algae.\n\nExcept it turned out that, as the great actor screamed at the end, \u201cSoylent Green is people. Soylent Green is People!\u201d\n\nAs a mother of four, also upsetting is how adults are using childrens\u2019 stress over the environment to score political points.\n\nSixteen-year-old Greta Thunberg\u2019s anxiety over the environment reflects, as the Federalist\u2019s David Harsanyi notes, a child\u2019s \u201cnarrow, age-appropriate, grasp of the world.\u201d Of course she is scared and upset as schools parrot information on an issue in which all the solutions are draconian, life-ending events. Yet, rather than helping her process her fears, she is brought out to argue for dramatic government takeover of all international business and government, with a chilling line that seems borrowed from Sting, \u201cWe will be watching you.\u201d\n\nLike most people, I care about the environment because I want a safe world for my children and future generations. But killing the preborn, eating the dead and turning control of all human life over to the government isn\u2019t a solution, but rather another set of problems.\n\nFear of climate change is being used to justify a radical social agenda, including abortion. I wonder if a child in the womb identified as a tree, would that be enough to justify saving that life? This debate is getting out of control.\n\n\u2022 Kristan Hawkins is president of Students for Life of America.
