'I've cried enough now to last me a career. I cried with my mum in the hotel in Beijing and in London. From now it's just going to be smiles, hopefully.\n\n'It still doesn't feel real. I'm just trying to wake myself up a bit. I think it's relief that I feel. Relief that going into my fourth World Champs that something bad hasn't happened again.'\n\nJohnson-Thompson suffered frustration in 2015 and 2017 but has transformed her situation\n\nWith Johnson-Thompson, those bad memories are often close to surface and it might just be the way she is and always will be. Indeed, it was notable how even in May, having started her resurgence with golds at the World Indoors, Commonwealth Games and European Indoors, she spoke of still feeling like an 'impostor' at the elite level.\n\nGreat confidence will likely never be one of her assets, owing to the scars of her results and injuries in the three-year period from 2014.\n\nIt was in detailing the nadir of Rio 2016, where she sat third through four stages but finished a disappointing sixth, that she broke down in tears on Friday morning.\n\n'I was fed up of this feeling,' she said. 'I just knew that my body couldn't make it through one, or my performances aren't up to scratch to compete. I didn't want to give up on something I truly believed, but\u2026'\n\nJohnson-Thompson stressed that she 'didn't want to give up on something I truly believed'\n\nAt that point Johnson-Thompson became emotional. 'I changed my life after that competition,' she said. 'I didn't want to give up on something I truly believed.'\n\nThe upshot has been a succession of gold medals in the past two years. The catalyst was her move to France in 2017, uprooting from a cosseted life under her mother's wing in Liverpool, and a redrawing of all her techniques under a new coach.\n\nWhile she has always had individual talents, she lacked the savvy to put them together in a heptathlon.\n\nWith that wisdom learnt from Bertrand Valcin, and from training next to decathlon world record holder Kevin Mayer, she has now collected medals at every level except the Olympics.\n\nThe next aim for Johnson-Thompson is to secure a gold medal at the Olympics in 2020\n\nCrucially, ahead of Tokyo 2020, she can also lay claim to a win over Thiam, who had not been beaten for three years. Her 304-point hammering of the great Belgian was the largest in a World Championships since 1987.\n\n'I'm in a great position now,' she said. 'It's the best position I've been in - gold medal, injury free, national record but I know what it's like to finish second and what it's like when you want to win and prove yourself and that will be a dangerous Nafi I will be competing against next year.. She's always on the brink of something special and she's proved she can get 7000 points and I expect her to do that next year.\n\n'I'm going to have to step up. I'm going to keep the same energy go back into training and want the same things for myself.\n\n'I have always wanted to win an Olympic gold so I don't think I will be short of inspiration over the next nine months.'", "description": "RIATH AL-SAMARRAI IN DOHA: There were tears before bedtime for Katarina Johnson-Thompson and a few more after breakfast on Friday morning.", "authors": ["Riath Al-Samarrai For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/16/19303976-0-image-a-24_1570204779191.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
