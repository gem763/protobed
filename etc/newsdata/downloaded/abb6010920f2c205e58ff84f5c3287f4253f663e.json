And the aftermath has tended to follow a pattern.\n\nIf history repeats itself, the bombshell news of Trudeau attending a party 20 years ago in brown makeup, reported by Time magazine Wednesday evening, will split the country into bitter disagreement over the extent to which this rates as a Canadian controversy.\n\nThe outcome of that argument will help decide whether Trudeau, who had already been hobbled by a corruption scandal and waning support from some progressives, survives an already-close race to win a second term Oct. 21.\n\nPast incidents of this sort have seen some Canadians attempt to argue that brownface or blackface is an American import \u2014 and that outrage over it counts as over-the-top political correctness in a land without the same history of Jim Crow laws and Al Jolson minstrel shows.\n\nEspecially in French-speaking Quebec, some commentators have rolled their eyes, or even lashed back angrily, at criticism of blackface incidents in their province. That\u2019s despite the fact that Quebec has been home to a number of these debates over the past decade. The incidents included an impersonation of Jamaican-Canadian hockey star P.K. Subban; college students pretending to be Jamaican athletes; and someone else portraying himself as a Senegalese-born comedian.\n\n\u201cNews flash: Cultural codes, and hence cultural taboos, sometimes differ from people to people and society to society,\u201d one prominent Quebec-based pundit wrote amid one such debate in 2015.\n\n\u201cBlackface, used in the detestable minstrelsies that used to portray stereotypical and generic versions of blacks as dimwitted, are not as well known in French Quebec as they are in English-speaking North America. The term blackface doesn't even have a French equivalent,\" he wrote.\n\nDon\u2019t count on Trudeau getting off so lightly.\n\nFor starters, he grew up speaking English, well versed in America\u2019s taboos, and this particular incident happened when he was nearly 30 years old and living in British Columbia.\n\nAlso, a vast swath of Canadians finds these incidents every bit as disgraceful as their American neighbors.\n\nThey argue that historical differences are no excuse because blackface holds an equally objectionable \u2014 if lesser-known \u2014 place in Canada\u2019s story.\n\nMinstrel shows were once popular in Canada, too. In fact, the composer of Canada\u2019s national anthem, Calixa Lavall\u00e9e, performed in blackface in the such shows.\n\n\u201cThus it might be said that the blackface is as Canadian as [the anthem] O Canada,\u201d says a McGill University website that tackles the topic.\n\nThe Canadian prime minister\u2019s reelection campaign was jolted by the report of Trudeau wearing what it described as \"brownface makeup\" as part of a costume at an Arabian Nights-themed party at a British Columbia school where he taught at the time.\n\nTrudeau defended himself Wednesday night by saying he should have known better, but didn't, and was sorry. He said he'd dressed up in an Aladdin costume two decades ago for a party, when he was a teacher, and had previously dressed in a similar way when he was in high school at a talent show.\n\n\"I\u2019m disappointed and pissed off at myself,\" Trudeau said, adding his agreement that the act of painting himself brown was racist.\n\nBefore Trudeau spoke, he was excoriated by one of his political opponents who usually describes him as a friend.\n\n\u201cSo shocked,\u201d Green Party leader Elizabeth May said, describing her initial reaction to the news.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shameful. When I look at it \u2014 and it\u2019s rare for me \u2014 I\u2019m almost speechless,\" she said. \u201dI don\u2019t know how he recovers.\u201d\n\nLauren Gardner contributed to this story from British Columbia.\n\nAuthors:", "description": "Canada has had these incidents before, and the aftermath has tended to follow a pattern.", "authors": ["Alexander Panetta", "Lauren Gardner"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167380583-1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
