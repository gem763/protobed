(AP) - After signing Kirk Cousins to a fully guaranteed contract last year, the Minnesota Vikings might have given their quarterback even more to work with this time.\n\nThis season will surely be a crossroad of sorts for both Cousins and the Vikings, their trajectory toward - or away from - that elusive Super Bowl victory inescapably intertwined.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty much a .500 quarterback in my career so far, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s where you want to be,\u201d Cousins said this summer, his most pronounced acknowledgement that his debut in purple did not quite pan out as he or the team hoped with an 8-7-1 record that missed the cut for the playoffs.\n\nOn the statistical surface, and by the eye test for stretches of the schedule, Cousins largely excelled. His 70.1 percent completion rate was the 10th-best in NFL history. He topped 4,000 passing yards for the fourth straight year, producing the fourth-highest total in the league during that span. His interception rate of 1.7 percent was the best of his career.\n\nStill, against the last four postseason-bound opponents the Vikings faced, losses to Chicago twice, New England and Seattle, Cousins posted four of his six worst passer ratings of 2018.\n\nWhen the Vikings lost the finale to the Bears, thus keeping them out of the playoffs, Cousins averaged 4 yards per attempt, his lowest of the year.\n\nThe offense had several weaknesses beyond his control, but his performance in the first edition of the $84 million deal wasn\u2019t strong enough to cover them up, either.\n\nSo the Vikings set out to make Cousins more successful this season, hiring former NFL head coach Gary Kubiak as an adviser after appointing Kevin Stefanski as offensive coordinator.\n\nNew offensive line coach Rick Dennison, a longtime companion of Kubiak, was also handed the title of running game coordinator to help boost a critical area that failed to take the pressure, literally and figuratively, off Cousins last year. Center Garrett Bradbury and tight end Irv Smith Jr. were their first two draft picks. Even wide receiver Josh Doctson, a familiar target for Cousins from their time together with Washington, was added this week.\n\n\u201cIf we have a really good year, but I don\u2019t play very well, does that mean I crossed the road and we\u2019re good? If I have my best year I\u2019ve ever had and we don\u2019t win, does that mean that I\u2019m not good? I don\u2019t know. I just think that winning does kind of tell the story, and if we win the rest tends to take care of itself,\u201d Cousins said Wednesday. \u201cI need to play well regardless, win or lose, and I\u2019ve got to earn my way every day. I\u2019m being evaluated like everyone else, and if I don\u2019t play well, win or lose, I\u2019m not going to be here.\u201d\n\nThe offense will put Cousins under center more often than the shotgun formation he frequently operated out of last season. Play-action passes will be a favorite, using a skill Cousins has long held. The arrival of Kubiak raised a too-many-cooks concern, but Cousins has expressed appreciation for the variety of perspectives the coaching staff can provide him. Cousins has also taken a more collaborative approach with the offense toward the implementation and digestion of the what, why and how of the new playbook.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s more about trying to help guys out and do his job, get the guys around him in the huddle on the right page, and go from there,\u201d coach Mike Zimmer said.\n\nThere\u2019s another change for Cousins this year, a beard he began growing at the beginning of training camp after a casual suggestion by Bradbury. Cousins said he\u2019s curious to see if his facial hair can match the thickness sported by new right guard Josh Kline.\n\n\u201cI kind of grew it on a whim,\u201d he said, smiling, \u201cso I\u2019ll probably cut it on a whim.\u201d\n\nBeneath the offseason enhancements, the Vikings still have at their core a wide receiver tandem in Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs that is one of the NFL\u2019s best. They\u2019re eager, too, to see what more Cousins can do in the revamped system. Diggs, though, made clear Wednesday that Cousins doesn\u2019t need to further prove himself.\n\n\u201cHe brings what you need from the quarterback position. So as far as like the leadership and me having him as a teammate, I love him,\u201d Diggs said. \u201cI think he does everything that he can, so I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a make-or-break season because the quarterback position is hard.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After signing Kirk Cousins to a fully guaranteed contract last year, the Minnesota Vikings might have given their quarterback even more to work with this time.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Campbell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/vikings_determined_cousins_football_14807_c0-148-3542-2213_s1770x1032.jpg?3e9298f7ca6f9f919f84a8407a0486bf1c22d62e"}
