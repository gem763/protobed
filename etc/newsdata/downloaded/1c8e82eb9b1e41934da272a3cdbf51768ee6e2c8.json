Cory Booker saying last weekend that if his campaign didn\u2019t raise $1.7 million by the end of the month, he\u2019d likely end his bid for the presidential nomination.\n\nPointing out how he\u2019s fallen behind the top-tier contenders when it comes to fundraising, Booker reiterated to reporters on Thursday, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to stay in competition with them unless we raise significant money.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cIf there\u2019s no way to win this election, why should I be in it?\u201d\n\nDNC MAKES IT HARDER FOR CANDIDATES TO QUALIFY FOR NOVEMBER DEBATE\n\nWhile Booker's comments were startling considering he'd been seen as a rising party star before the campaign began, they also reflected the harsh reality of this phase of the campaign. Booker and the rest of the contenders in the record-setting field of 2020 candidates face two key deadlines this week that could further shrink the field in the coming days and weeks.\n\nFirst is the close of the July-September fundraising quarter, which is just a day away. Two days later \u2013 on Oct. 2 \u2013 is the deadline for the presidential candidates to reach the thresholds to qualify for October\u2019s primary debate. Poor fundraising figures and a failure to reach the prime-time debate stage could force many of the lower-tier White House contenders to seriously contemplate calling it quits.\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a double whammy,\u201d veteran political scientist and longtime presidential primary observer Dante Scala noted.\n\n\u201cOne, if their third-quarter fundraising numbers are disappointing, that\u2019s going to be news. That\u2019s going to set off a warning siren in the media that a death watch will begin. And then, if you add to that not being on the debate stage, the sirens will only get louder,\u201d said Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire.\n\nFor Booker, he appears poised to make the next debate stage, and his frank talk on fundraising certainly served to shake loose some campaign donations in the ensuing days.\n\nBut, veteran Democratic consultant Lynda Tran said the news that Booker, \u201cwho has long been seen as a star in the party, and who has been at various times at the bottom of the top tier of contenders, is seriously considering ending his campaign if his fundraising numbers don't come up substantially, is a pretty clear sign of the state of the race.\u201d\n\nThe field of Democrats \u2013 which at one point this summer reached roughly two-dozen candidates \u2013 started shrinking in July and August as Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, and Reps. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Eric Swalwell of California ended their White House bids. A week ago, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio dropped out.\n\nAll of those candidates were struggling to gain traction and to raise campaign cash, and faced steep uphill climbs to qualify for the autumn debates.\n\nFor those still in the race who clearly won\u2019t make the stage at next month\u2019s debate, qualifying for the November showdown will get even tougher, as the Democratic National Committee has raised the thresholds for the fifth-round debate.\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro qualified for both the September and October showdowns, but he\u2019s still struggling to haul in campaign cash and pop in the polls.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t say this lightly: If I don\u2019t make the next debate stage, it will be the end of my campaign,\u201d he warned in a fundraising email to supporters on Thursday.\n\nThe double deadlines come with four months to go until voting begins in the Iowa caucuses, the first contest in the presidential nominating calendar.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, it is early yet. There are plenty of days left on the calendar for the candidates to get in front of voters and promote their ideas and vision for leading the nation,\u201d noted Tran, who ran communications for the Obama-era grassroots group Organizing for America and was a founding partner of the communications firm 270 Strategies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut, she pointed out that \u201cthe historically expansive field and a White House that continually dominates headlines with its churn, chaos, and corruption means there is simply less oxygen in the room for each individual vying for the presidency.\u201d\n\nTran spoke with Fox News days before House Democrats formally launched their impeachment inquiry into the president over the Ukraine controversy. The news has largely overshadowed the presidential race ever since.", "description": "Candidates in the record-setting field of 2020 Democrats face two key deadlines this coming week.", "authors": ["Paul Steinhauser", "Paul Steinhauser Is A Politics Reporter Based In New Hampshire."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/14/694940094001_6086178035001_6086178969001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
