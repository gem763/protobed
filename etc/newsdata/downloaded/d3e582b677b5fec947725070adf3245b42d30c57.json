Johnson has both said he will not request an extension and that he will not break the U.K. law.\n\nUnder the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, U.K. ministers can suspend the rule of law for 30 days after declaring a state of emergency in the country. The act also provides the government with wide-ranging powers to put in place regulations to deal with emergencies that threaten \u201cserious damage to human welfare,\u201d or that could damage the security of the country.\n\nIn January, Mark Sedwill, the U.K.\u2019s cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, had said the government has no expectation it will need to use these powers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nBut Cable said Downing Street has recently talked up the prospects of riots and civil unrest if MPs prevent the U.K. from exiting the EU on October 31.\n\nHe added it would be relatively easy for the government to substantiate that there is an emergency situation. Ministers would only need to prove that an event or situation could cause loss of human life or injury, or disruption to communication networks, transport systems, or the supply of money, food, water, energy or fuel.\n\nOpposition MPs are meeting regularly to find ways of ensuring Johnson does not take Britain out of the EU without a deal, but according to Cable, in that scenario, MPs may struggle to successfully challenge the Johnson in time to avert a no-deal Brexit, with any legal challenge potentially reaching the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIt would be a travesty if that happened because Britain is a peaceful, law-abiding country,\u201d Cable said.\n\nA spokesperson for Downing Street said: \u201cThe PM has said that what we want to do is get a deal, and get Brexit done on October 31 without any further pointless delay. Yesterday, we put forward a fair and reasonable compromise, that we hope should provide the basis for rapid negotiations towards a solution.\n\n\u201cThere is no purpose in discussing hypothetical scenarios around the Benn Act. It is without question that the Prime Minister will comply with the law.\u201d", "description": "UK government could temporarily suspend rule of law and take Britain out of the EU without a deal, says former Liberal Democrat leader.", "authors": ["Cristina Gallardo"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1174808814-1200x628.jpg"}
