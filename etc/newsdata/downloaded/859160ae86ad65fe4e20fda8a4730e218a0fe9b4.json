REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\n\nThe results could bolster the government\u2019s expectations that solid domestic demand will help counter the drag from exports, as the Sino-U.S. trade war and global slowdown weigh on the country\u2019s economic growth. That offers relief to policymakers who are under pressure to deploy further stimulus to prevent the trade-dependent economy from falling into a recession.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe has vowed to take \u201call possible steps\u201d if risks to the economy mount, echoing a pledge made by the central bank and signalling the prospect of fiscal stimulus in case this month\u2019s sales tax increase triggers a sharp economic downturn.\n\nUnderlining the rocky road ahead, the monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BOJ) closely-watched tankan quarterly survey, foresees manufacturers\u2019 mood slipping over the coming three months and service-sector morale sliding.\n\nIn the Reuters poll of 504 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 248 firms responded on condition of anonymity, manufacturers voiced worry about the protracted trade war and slowdown in China\u2019s economy \u2014 Japan\u2019s largest trading partner.\n\nStill, some Japanese firms do not see the impact of the global slowdown immediately hurting the export-reliant economy.\n\nA manager of an electrical machinery maker said business conditions had turned out to be \u201cunexpectedly\u201d good, although the domestic economy was likely to worsen due to slowdown in China, Asia and the United States from the trade war.\n\n\u201cDemand for capital expenditure at manufacturers has proven surprisingly resilient, and it looks to be avoiding the kind of slump we had expected,\u201d the manager wrote in the survey.\n\nThe sentiment index for manufacturers stood at minus 5, up two points from the prior month\u2019s 6-1/2-year low of minus 7, according to the survey conducted Sept. 26 to Oct. 7.\n\nThe index is expected to swing to minus 6 in January.\n\nThe service-sector index climbed to plus 25, up from plus 19 in the previous month, led by retailers who have likely benefited from consumers rushing to beat the Oct. 1 sales tax which went up to 10% from 8%.\n\nStill, retailers\u2019 sentiment index was seen falling to zero in January, after surging 20 points to plus 30 in October. The sharp retreat highlights concerns over the effects of the tax hike on private consumption, which accounts for around 60% of the economy.\n\nThe overall service-sector index is expected to fall to plus 15 in January.\n\nThe BOJ\u2019s last tankan in early October showed that big manufacturers\u2019 business confidence worsened to a six-year low in the July-September quarter, a sign the year-long U.S.-China trade war was taking a heavier toll on the Japanese economy.\n\nThe Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists.", "description": "TOKYO - Japanese manufacturers' business outlook was less pessimistic in October while service-sector sentiment rose to a three-month high, the Reuters Tankan poll found, likely easing fears for now of the world's third-largest economy falling into a recession.", "authors": ["Tetsushi Kajimoto", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1439035460&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9826K", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
