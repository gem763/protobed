And now, as a starter for the Minnesota Twins, Niekro had baffled the Yankees for seven innings. The Yankees wound up winning the game, but the Boss was fuming.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nFrom the speakerphone on Woodward\u2019s desk, the voice of Steinbrenner blared out loud and clear: \u201cNow, Woody, this is what you\u2019re going to do. You\u2019re going to go down to the clubhouse and you\u2019re going to take full responsibility for this move. You\u2019re going to make sure the press knows I had nothing to do with this.\u201d\n\nAll Woodward could say was, \u201cYes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.\u201d\n\nAnd the 19-year-old staffer, working a summer job between semesters at Catholic University in Washington, D.C., thought to himself as he listened in, \u201cMan, I would never want that job.\u201d\n\nThat 19-year-old\u2019s name was Brian Cashman, and for the past 21 years, \u201cthat job\u201d \u2014 the job that ate up Clyde King, and eventually Woodward, who succeeded him the following season, and Lou Piniella and Gene Michael and Gabe Paul and Bob Watson and in fact, all 11 men who held it during Steinbrenner\u2019s stormy first 25 years as owner of the Yankees \u2014 has belonged to him.\n\nAnd now it seems like there\u2019s virtually nothing he could do to lose it.\n\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019m a general partner of this team,\u201d said Hank Steinbrenner, the older of George Steinbrenner\u2019s two sons, \u201cBrian Cashman will be the general manager.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThat is remarkable considering that when he was hired as a 31-year-old to replace Watson, Cashman was the 12th general manager hired by Steinbrenner, a man who seemed to change GMs as often as he changed his socks.\n\nThe Yankees revolving door\n\nOnly one of Cashman\u2019s predecessors held the job for as many as seven years, and that was Michael, who required two stints, with a stormy managerial stint in-between. Every other one of George\u2019s GMs lasted one or two seasons at most before either being pushed off the ledge, or jumping first.\n\nWorking for Steinbrenner was \u201ca very difficult, demanding job,\u201d says Joe Torre, who endured his own remarkable 12-year run as the Yankees manager. \u201cYou always have to live up to being part of the Yankees. It keeps you on edge.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, Cashman has worked in that pressure cooker for nearly twice as long as Torre. Longer, in fact, than all but one of his 18 predecessors, Ed Barrow, who held the post for 24 years and benefited greatly from having players named Ruth, Gehrig and DiMaggio and an owner not named Steinbrenner.\n\nThe recent firing of Dave Dombrowksi by the Boston Red Sox less than a year after the team he built won 108 regular-season games and the World Series, only serves to remind us of how mind-boggling Cashman\u2019s longevity is.\n\nWhen you add in the fact that the Yankees have not won a World Series in 10 years, an eye blink for most franchises but an eternity for this one, Cashman\u2019s record of steady employment borders on the surreal.\n\nBut what may be even more incredible is that, over the past 10 years in which Hal Steinbrenner assumed the reins from his aging dad, Brian Cashman has become the official voice of the Yankees. In his own quiet way, Cashman has relegated the Yankees owner to the background, a situation that would have been unthinkable when George was alive but seems to be exactly the way Hal wants it.\n\nGeorge Steinbrenner, right, named Brian Cashman, left, as Yankees general manager in 1998. (AP)\n\nThe secret to Cashman\u2019s success\n\nAsk Cashman how he has managed to successfully navigate a minefield that chewed up so many of his predecessors and he will tell you, \u201cWe\u2019ve had great players and I\u2019ve been fortunate to work with a tremendous staff. And I\u2019ve been blessed to work with the Steinbrenner family for all of my adult life.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhen told there has to be more to it than that, he says, \u201cYou\u2019ll never get that from me. I\u2019m not going to be patting myself on the back and have to go to Dr. Andrews for rotator cuff surgery.\u201d\n\nInstead, leave it to Randy Levine, the Yankees president and probably the man closest in temperament to George Steinbrenner in the organization, including George\u2019s son Hal, to explain the secret of Cashman\u2019s survival: \u201cHe\u2019s really smart, he\u2019s adaptable and he knows how to work with people. He\u2019s strong and he holds his ground, but he\u2019s not stubborn. If other people have ideas that are better than his or that he disagrees with, he\u2019s flexible enough to change. And, he\u2019s loyal.\u201d\n\nThat last may be the most important trait for working well with the Steinbrenners; Cashman said he has turned down numerous offers, for more money and less agita, over the past 20 years because \u201cI never forgot I am nobody without George touching [my career], without him giving me the opportunity to be an intern, then his assistant farm director, his assistant general manager and eventually taking the chance on making me his general manager. I felt that as long as he wanted me here, there\u2019s no way I could walk away from him. He created me.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees have had 22 consecutive winning seasons since Cashman took over in 1998. Including 2019, they have won 100 games or more seven times. They have won four world championships, 13 division titles and missed the playoffs just four times.\n\nStill, Cashman says, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m under pressure every day.\u201d\n\nHe does concede, however, that working for Hal is not like working for George.\n\n\u201cDefinitely a different management style,\u201d he said. \u201cHe would threaten you, tell you you\u2019re on the clock, you better be right or you know what\u2019s going to happen, stuff like that.\u201d\n\nAnd how many times did he fire you?\n\n\u201cOfficially, never. But the threat was always there.\u2019\u2019\n\nHal Steinbrenner declined to be interviewed for this story, but his brother Hank said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like it was before. Things were a lot more tumultuous back in the \u201870s and \u201880s.\u201d\n\nSaid another Yankee employee who requested anonymity, \u201cI think it\u2019s gotten a little easier for Cash to work under Hal.\u201d\n\nBrian Cashman has been GM of the Yankees for 21 years, and is in no danger of losing his job as long as Hal Steinbrenner is in charge. (AP)\n\nIs 2019 Cashman\u2019s masterpiece?\n\nThis year, the Yankees won their first American League East division title since 2012, and they did it despite an unprecedented cascade of injuries \u2014 they placed a record 36 players on the injured list, including every one of their starters, and lost 2,246 games to injury \u2014 and are neck-and-neck with the Houston Astros in the race for the best record in baseball, and the homefield advantage throughout the playoffs that goes with it.\n\nAnd most nights this season, the Yankees have done it with a lineup that even the Tampa Bay Rays could afford. Instead of $21 million, perpetually injured Jacoby Ellsbury in center, the Yankees have used Brett Gardner for less than half the price. In place of $26 million Giancarlo Stanton, the Yankees have divvied their DH role among Edwin Encarnacion, Clint Frazier, Luke Voit and Mike Ford, who cost about a third of that combined.\n\nThe Yankees have gotten world-class production out of the likes of Gio Urshela, who was was in the running for the AL batting crown before, of course, going on the IL with a groin injury at the end of August; from D.J. LeMahieu, a former NL batting champion who the Colorado Rockies allowed to leave in free agency and is currently hitting .328, and Mike Tauchman, who filled in more than admirably when Aaron Judge missed more than two months with an oblique strain.\n\nIf nothing else, the 2019 Yankees have proven that Cashman and his staff can beat you with more than Hal Steinbrenner\u2019s checkbook.\n\nUrshela was acquired from the Toronto Blue Jays for $25,000, or about the price of a Hyundai Santa Fe. Tauchman came from the Rockies in a trade for minor-league pitcher Philip Diehl. And the Yankees tied up LeMahieu for two years at $12 million per year, the same amount the Mets paid for another infielder, Jed Lowrie, who except for a handful of pinch-hitting appearances has yet to play a game this season.\n\nSimple rule of thumb: If Cashman wants one of your guys, hold onto him. And if he\u2019s willing to part with one of his, pass.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that Brian and his regime have done for years now,\u201d said Billy Eppler, who worked under Cashman as an assistant and is now the GM of the L.A. Angels. \u201cHaving seen it first hand, it doesn\u2019t surprise me at all.\u201d\n\nEppler admiringly calls Cashman\u2019s maneuverings at the 2016 trading deadline, in which he moved his two stud relievers, Andrew Miller and Aroldis Chapman, in exchange for prospects Clint Frazier and Gleyber Torres, \u201cArbitrage at its finest.\u201d\n\nNot only has Torres exploded offensively \u2014 he has 38 home runs as a 22-year-old second-year player \u2014 but Cashman was able to re-sign Chapman to a three-year contract after he was done helping end the Chicago Cubs\u2019 108-year World Series drought as a three-month rental.\n\nAnd this year, when the Blue Jays were demanding Frazier be included in a deadline deal for Marcus Stroman, Cashman refused to let the promising but erratic young outfielder go.\n\n\u201cWe were interested in Stroman but we didn\u2019t think he would be a difference-maker,\u201d he said. \u201cWe felt he would be in our bullpen in the postseason.\u201d\n\nCashman deserves nearly as much credit for the moves he and his staff chose not to make; passing up on Manny Machado and Bryce Harper, for instance. Aside from home runs, Machado\u2019s stats are not as good as Urshela\u2019s and despite adding Harper, the Phillies didn\u2019t qualify for the postseason.\n\n\u201cIn certain circumstances we acquired players because we felt they had some untapped potential that we were going to bet on,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cAnd some guys we just got as insurance policies in case things went wrong, which they did.\u201d\n\nTauchman and Luke Voit \u2014 who has hit 35 home runs in 139 games over parts of two Yankee seasons after the Cardinals gave up on him \u2014 were acquired as untapped potential guys. Encarnacion was an insurance policy for Voit, who sure enough, got hurt. Urshela was picked up as an inexpensive backup for Miguel Andujar, who wound up tearing a shoulder labrum 12 games into the season.\n\n\u201cWe thought maybe he\u2019d be a utility player for us,\u201d Cashman said of Urshela. \u201cBut never did we expect we would be sitting on Manny Machado, you know? But that\u2019s the kind of season we had.\u201d\n\n\u201cCash has a great sense of which players to sign and for how much,\u2019\u2019 said Levine, with whom Cashman publicly disagreed over the re-signing of Alex Rodriguez in 2007 and the signing of Rafael Soriano in 2011. \u201cI think the signing of LeMahieu was one of the greatest Yankee signings in decades.\u201d\n\nCashman has not done as well with starting pitching. Sonny Gray was a bust in his two years as a Yankee. This winter, he was unable to come to terms with free agent Patrick Corbin, who wound up having a good season for the Washington Nationals. And the Yankees, among 28 other teams, also passed on their old nemesis Dallas Keuchel, who has won five of his past six starts for the Atlanta Braves.\n\nFor a time, it appeared the Yankees\u2019 major offseason pitching acquisition, James Paxton, would turn out to be another Gray, but he has rebounded to be the team\u2019s best starter the past two months, and Luis Severino, out with a shoulder injury for much of the season, returned this week looking as if he could be a major factor in the playoffs.\n\n\u201cLife\u2019s full of regrets,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cBut this year, I have no regrets. I feel like we\u2019ve accomplished phase one of our goals, which was winning the division, and we\u2019re in pretty good shape for the next phase. But until we win the World Series we really haven\u2019t accomplished anything yet.\u201d\n\nGeorge Steinbrenner couldn\u2019t have said it better than that, which is hardly surprising since, as Cashman said, \u201cI\u2019m a graduate of Steinbrenner University.\u201d\n\nAfter 21 years, Cashman is more than just a graduate. Now, he's more like a tenured professor.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "General Manager of the New York Yankees is not a long-tenured position.
