(The show is now on Netflix).\n\nAustralian actor Robert Taylor portrayed Walt Longmire and Katee Sackhoff portrayed his deputy, Victoria \u201cVic\u201d Moretti, a transplanted South Philly Italian-American and former Philadelphia cop. Lou Diamond Phillips portrayed Henry Standing Bear, Longmire\u2019s best friend, and the series also offered a good number of other fine cast members.\n\nI liked the Walt Longmire character, a big man who is tough, taciturn, intelligent, fair, and possesses a dry sense of humor. I also liked the rural crime stories, so I began reading the series of novels.\n\nIn his last outing in the novel \u201cDepth of Winter,\u201d Walt Longmire, the sheriff of Absaroka County, Wyoming, headed to Mexico to take on Tomas Bidarte, the head of a vicious drug cartel, who had kidnapped the sheriff\u2019s daughter. He rescued her and killed the drug lord in a brutal fight, which left the sheriff\u2019s body, as well as his mind, scarred.\n\nIn \u201cLand of Wolves\u201d we find a thinner, weaker and more reticent sheriff, who loses himself in moments of staring off into space. But the hanged body of a migrant Chilean shepherd, Miquel Hernandez, which may be a case of suicide or murder, moves the sheriff and his deputies to investigate.\n\nComplicating the case is the fact that the hanged man worked for Abarrane Extepare, the head of a wealthy Basque family, who had been in prison for shooting off the leg of Walt Longmire\u2019s predecessor. The rugged, elderly rancher is holding his grandson when he is interviewed by Walt Longmire. The grandfather is estranged from the boys\u2019 mother and father, his daughter and son-in-law, and this family drama factors into the case.\n\nAlso complicating the case is Miquel Hernandez\u2019s feet appeared to have been chewed on by an old, gray and oversized wolf that Walt Longmire had seen earlier in the Big Horn Mountains, where wolves had not been seen in some years.\n\n\u201cWhen you see a wolf, you can\u2019t help feeling impressed,\u201d Walt Longmire, the novel\u2019s narrator tells us. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re so used to being around their more domesticated cousins, but this animal is something else. Aside from all the crap that you see on TV and in the movies or even in badly written books, they\u2019re not the slathering beasts just outside the glow of the campfire; there\u2019s only one word that comes to mind when I\u2019ve ever seen one in the wild: empathic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re reading your mind, because they have to know what you\u2019re thinking to simply survive.\u201d\n\nWalt Longmire goes on to note that once an ancient nomadic hunter tossed a greasy leg of caribou to a curious pair of eyes, he set off a chain reaction of genetic mutation of over 800.000 years that bred a partner for mankind, and an entirely different branch of canine was born.\n\n\u201cFor the sacrifice of their freedom came security and their role as guard and companion,\u201d Walt Longmore explained. \u201cThat was not the animal I was looking at now.\u201d\n\nThe townspeople of Durant, the county seat of Absaroka, are frightened due to the sighting of the wolf and demand a wolf hunt. Walt Longmire is not only convinced that the shepherd did not hang himself, he is also convinced that the wolf is not a threat.\n\nAlso attempting to save the wolf is Keasik Cheechoo, a nurse and volunteer for the wolf conservancy. The woman is aggressive and demanding and both helps and hinders Walt Longmire as he investigates the case.\n\nThe novel features the regular cast of Walt Longmire\u2019s world, such as Vic, his love interest, and his blunt and profane undersheriff; his Indian friend Henry Standing Bear; his dedicated and long-suffering receptionist, Ruby; his deputy, Sancho; and his daughter, Cady, who is also recovering from their Mexican adventure.\n\nLike the other novels in the series, Walt Longmire, a well-read man, offers in his narration a running commentary that notes geographical, literary and historical facts that pertain to the story.\n\nThe novel also offers abundant humor in the interplay and dialogue between Walt Longmire and Vic Moretti, as well as Ruby\u2019s comedic attempts to get the sheriff to use his new computer, so she won\u2019t have to print out his emails and respond to the emails by typing the sheriff\u2019s hand-written notes on the printed-out email. The sheriff, who does not own or carry a cell phone, is not technically proficient and does not want to be.\n\n\u201cLand of Wolves\u201d is an interesting and well-written crime and mystery novel that fans of Walt Longmire, as well as new readers, will enjoy.\n\n\u2022 Paul Davis covers crime, espionage and terrorism.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nLAND OF WOLVES\n\nBy Craig Johnson\n\nViking, $28, 336 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
