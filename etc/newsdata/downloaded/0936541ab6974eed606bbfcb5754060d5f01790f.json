(AP) \u2014 A Pennsylvania state representative is on a month of house arrest after pleading guilty to driving drunk at a McDonald\u2019s drive-thru in Harrisburg earlier this year.\n\nDauphin County Court records indicate Democratic Rep. John Galloway of Levittown pleaded guilty last week in what was his second drunken-driving arrest since 2011.\n\nHis previous arrest was resolved by his participation in a diversion program designed for first-time, nonviolent offenders, so the May violation counts as his second offense.\n\nA House Democratic spokesman says the 59-year-old Galloway underwent a monthlong inpatient treatment program in July and August, after the state budget was finished.\n\nGalloway was first elected in the suburban Philadelphia district in 2006. He didn\u2019t return messages seeking comment.\n\nPolice say they were called after Galloway\u2019s Jeep rear-ended another vehicle.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Pennsylvania state representative is on a month of house arrest after pleading guilty to driving drunk at a McDonald's drive-thru in Harrisburg earlier this year.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2015/06/10/shutterstock_184689539_c0-65-1000-648_s1770x1032.jpg?27db217c9482e74572eb6625a1f62357fab06107", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
