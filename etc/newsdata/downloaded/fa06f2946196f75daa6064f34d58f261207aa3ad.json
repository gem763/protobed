But on one recent visit, my plans changed at the last minute. At 6 p.m. on my only night in the city, my lodging fell through. My only options were to either crash on another friend's couch in an open-plan apartment \u2014 a generous offer I would have accepted were I not such a notoriously sensitive sleeper \u2014 or find a hotel when it was already practically dinnertime.\n\nI chose the latter. I started searching online with the goal of a four-star property in a reasonably accessible part of town that was comfortable, clean, safe, and welcoming enough.\n\nI settled on Le M\u00e9ridien San Francisco in the Financial District after I saw it advertised online for $149. It seemed like an exceptionally good price for a global chain with a luxury reputation (might as well earn those Marriott Bonvoy points), with zero advance planning, in a bustling and walkable part of town.\n\n\n\nWhile procrastinating doesn't always work out, this last-minute choice certainly hit the sweet spot between budget and comfort. Of course, prices are subject to change and highly dependent on the time of year and season, which can impact pricing. You won't always see this price, but at the time of publication, it was indeed offered for a same-day booking. Two months out, it looks much pricier.\n\nHere's why I would stay at Le M\u00e9ridien San Francisco again, and next time, even plan it in advance.\n\nKeep reading to see why I was so impressed by Le M\u00e9ridien San Francisco.", "description": "While looking for a last-minute solo stay in San Francisco, I selected Le M\u00e9ridien San Francisco for its location, comfort, and budget rates.", "authors": ["Alesandra Dubin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db6f708dee0193fa30efdf3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
