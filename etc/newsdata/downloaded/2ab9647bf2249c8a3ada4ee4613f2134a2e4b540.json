Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) visited Hong Kong Saturday, standing in solidarity with the protesters fighting against for greater control of their city.\n\nSen. Cruz traveled to Hong Kong Saturday and made statements condemning China\u2019s handling of pro-democracy protests, calling the Chinese government a \u201cdictatorship.\u201d\n\nOn Face the Nation, Sen. Cruz said that he finds it \u201cinspiring\u201d to see millions of Hong Kongers fighting for freedom.\n\nThe Texas senator said:\n\nI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s happening here in Hong Kong is inspiring. We\u2019ve seen over two million people come to the streets standing up for freedom, standing up for democracy, and standing up against the oppression of the Chinese Communist regime. I think it is very much in the United States\u2019 interests to support the people of Hong Kong. I\u2019m here, I\u2019m dressed in all black standing in solidarity with the protesters.\n\nOn @FaceTheNation: What's happening in Hong Kong is inspiring. We've seen over 2 million people standing up for freedom, for democracy & standing up against the oppression of the Chinese communist regime.

He exercises authoritarian control over China as chairman of the Communist Party and commander-in-chief of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA).\n\nDallas News US Sen.

Cruz amidst Hong Kong\u2019s protests. The Texas senator revealed that Lam\u2019s office reportedly asked the senator to meet in secret and that Cruz refrain from speaking with the media about the meeting.\n\nCruz said that Lam\u2019s request displays a lack of understanding of the meaning of free speech.\n\n\u201cShe seems to misunderstand how free speech operates, and also how freedom of the press operates,\u201d Sen. Cruz said.\n\n\u201cMs. Lam\u2019s canceling the meeting is not a sign of strength. It\u2019s a sign of weakness. It\u2019s a sign of fear of the protesters in the streets of Hong Kong,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nSen. Cruz said this week that his tour throughout the Indo-Pacific will discuss how to most \u201ceffectively stand up to this growing geopolitical threat coming from increasing Chinese aggressiveness.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina is getting more and more aggressive militarily. They are investing billions in modernizing their military. They are investing massive amounts of money engaging in economic coercion,\u201d he added.\n\nSen. Cruz invited National Basketball Association (NBA) Commissioner Adam Silver to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will serve as part of a series of hearings into American companies bowing to government and economic pressure from the Chinese government. Cruz has questioned China\u2019s influence on American influence for years. In 2017, Sens. Cruz and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) urged Apple CEO Tim Cook to reject Chinese pressure to remove virtual private network (VPN) apps from its App Store in China, which would allow citizens to circumvent the Chinese censorship firewall.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), another fierce critic of China, visited Hong Kong over the weekend. In a message to Hong Kong protesters, he compared their protests to East Germany\u2019s struggle for freedom against the Soviet Union.\n\n\u201cSometimes, the fate of one city defines the challenge of a whole generation. Fifty years ago it was Berlin, today it\u2019s Hong Kong,\u201d Sen. Hawley said.\n\nSen.
