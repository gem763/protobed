Click here to buy it on Amazon.\n\nIn his book, he describes how he focused on growth stocks and the new technologies in the financial services business. In the short run, stocks could tumble by 30% or more, but in the long run, they were huge winners.\n\nHis own stock, Charles Schwab Corporation (NASDAQ: SCHW), has fallen 50% or more during various crises (1987, 2001 and 2008), but since inception has gone up 21,000%!\n\nWe both have a lot in common \u2014 we began our careers during the financial revolution of the 1970s as editors of a financial newsletter when the stock and bond markets were in a decade-long bear market. It was the age of alternative investing in \u201cgold, silver and Swiss francs,\u201d collectibles, real estate and money market funds\u2026 the energy crisis and fear of runaway inflation.\n\nThen Schwab went into the discount brokerage business, and I stayed in the newsletter and teaching world. Today, I\u2019m worth several million. Meanwhile, Schwab is worth several billion! However, I have my freedom; there are always trade-offs in life. (Here\u2019s my largest personal IRA holding, if you\u2019re curious)\n\n\n\nRevolution #1: Discount Broker Commissions\n\nThe \u201870s also were the time of a financial revolution for the common man. Americans could earn interest on their checking accounts. The Reserve Fund, the first money market fund, was created in 1971.\n\nThe year 1975 was special. Americans finally could own gold again. And on May Day, 1975, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deregulated brokerage commissions. Before that, commissions were fixed, and investors often paid 3% to buy stocks and 8% or more to buy mutual funds.\n\nMerrill Lynch raised its commissions on May Day, and Charles Schwab, the discount brokerage firm, was in business. He eventually grew it into the largest independent brokerage in the world.\n\nHe would see the day when his fledging discount brokerage firm out of San Francisco would surpass the power and prestige of Merrill Lynch, the original firm that brought Wall Street to Main Street.\n\n\u201cThe stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,\u201d as the Bible says.\n\nIn fact, the only reason Merrill Lynch is around today is because Bank of America bailed it out during the financial crisis of 2008.\n\nRevolution #2: Give Investors Independence\n\nCharles Schwab also did something different in the brokerage business \u2014 he let investors decide for themselves what to buy and sell. \u201cI have always believed in giving choices, and with those choices the freedom and power to make their own decisions.\u201d\n\nEven today, Merrill doesn\u2019t get it, Schwab said.\n\n\u201cThey never modernized,\u201d Schwab told me. \u201cThey never let go of the old, broken model \u2014 selling stocks to make commissions. They never worked to reduce their costs. They never considered modern portfolio theory (recommending buying index funds). They didn\u2019t let customers choose for themselves.\u201d\n\n\u2018What Will Cause the Next Crisis?\u2019\n\nI asked Mr. Schwab (I can\u2019t get used to calling him \u201cChuck\u201d) if a bear market is around the corner, given that we\u2019ve enjoyed a 10-year bull market. In his book, he confesses, \u201cIf I had learned anything after years in the business, it was how little I could ever know about what the markets would do tomorrow.\u201d\n\nBut he did give me a hint to the question, \u201cWhen will we suffer the next crisis?\u201d He said, \u201cWe\u2019re fat and happy right now in the brokerage business. There\u2019s so much money out there, that\u2019s why interest rates are so low. Only a liquidity crisis and higher interest rates can cause stocks to collapse again. I don\u2019t see it right now.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Capitalism: Much Better than Socialism\n\nCharles Schwab is one of the greatest examples of democratic capitalism. He\u2019s an entrepreneur at heart. His employees get stock options and participate in the profits \u2014 and losses \u2014 of the company. His customers get the best service at the lowest cost. He has brought Wall Street to Main Street and improved the lives of millions of people.\n\nI asked him, \u201cAre you worried about the popularity of democratic socialism in politics and academia?\u201d His response was emphatic: \u201cVoters and students don\u2019t understand capitalism in raising our standard of living. It\u2019s a sad state. Socialism was a disaster. In the 1980s, I visited Moscow, Poland and the Iron Curtain countries, and life was worse for everyone.\u201d\n\nHe is hopeful that if someone like Senator Elizabeth Warren gets elected, she will moderate her anti-capitalist stance.\n\nHe talked about \u201cgreat economists like you at Chapman and Michael Boskin at Stanford\u201d who are teaching the benefits of financial capitalism on college campuses.\n\n\u2018What\u2019s the Most Important Lesson in Life?\u2019\n\nAt the end of the interview, I asked Mr. Schwab, \u201cYou\u2019ve lived a long life, what\u2019s the most important lesson you have learned?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cNever give up on your own education. Watch less television and READ more! Be responsible for yourself.\u201d\n\nWe exchanged copies of our books \u2014 he signed a copy of \u201cInvested,\u201d and I gave him a 6th edition of \u201cMaxims of Wall Street.\u201d (See photo.)\n\nHis eyes lit up. \u201cGreat idea. I\u2019ll learn some new sayings!\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve quoted a few sayings from Charles Schwab above. Here are some more:\n\n\u201cLuck is almost never only luck, especially in anything having to do with the stock market or in building a business.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a central truth about investing: time is on your side when there\u2019s plenty of it; it can be your worst enemy when it\u2019s scarce.\u201d\n\nGet Your Autographed Copy of \u2018Maxims\u2019 at a Discount!\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing I have learned from Charles Schwab, it\u2019s to give my customers a discount. My bestselling book, \u201cThe Maxims of Wall Street,\u201d retails for $24.95, even on Amazon. But you can get an autographed copy for only $20 \u2014 and all additional copies are only $10 each. If you order an entire box of 32 books, you pay only $300. Plus, I pay postage and autograph each copy that is mailed within the United States.\n\nAs we approach the holidays, \u201cMaxims\u201d is the perfect gift for friends, investors, clients, students, money managers and stockbrokers.\n\nIt\u2019s fun and educational to read on every page. The book is divided by topics, such as growth vs. income, contrary investing, bargain hunting, the pros and cons of gold, etc. Plus, it includes lots of stories about J. P. Morgan, Joe Kennedy, Bernard Baruch and Jesse Livermore.\n\nMaxims is the one and only compendium of financial adages, ancient proverbs and worldly wisdom \u2014 it has sold over 28,000 copies. Alex Green calls it a \u201cclassic.\u201d It has been endorsed by Warren Buffett, Jack Bogle and Dennis Gartman, who said, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing the depth of wisdom one can find in just one or two lines from your book.\u201d\n\nTo order, call Harold at Ensign Publishing at 1-866-254-2057, or go to www.skousenbooks.com.\n\nUpcoming Conferences\n\nGold is back!
