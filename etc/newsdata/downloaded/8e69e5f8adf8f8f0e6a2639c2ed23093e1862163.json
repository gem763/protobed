Instead visitors see a message that reads: \"We are currently performing scheduled maintenance and updates on the website.\"\n\nVolusion provides shopping cart software to thousands of merchants, and according to Mr Afrahim has had 185 million orders placed via its software, amounting to $28bn in transactions.\n\nTwo other security researchers, from Trend Micro and RiskIQ, also confirmed the issue to ZDNet, which was first to report the incident.", "description": "Malicious software has been stealing credit card details from thousands of online stores, say researchers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/25AE/production/_109164690_cookiemonster.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
