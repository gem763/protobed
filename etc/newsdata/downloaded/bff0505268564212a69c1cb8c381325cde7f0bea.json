Otherwise, the repayments can cause further liquidity distress, compromising the policy objectives.\"\n\n\"This need to be more lenient to banks when they take more liquidity risk, and the consequential lack of credible deterrence, occurs because the policy does not require banks to commit future assets.\n\n\"The authority only receives compensation (i.e. securities) for its liquidity provision at the height of the crisis, when banks have little to compensate without failing.\"\n\nHis model demonstrates that lending to banks via repo can curb fire selling of relatively illiquid securities that are accepted as collateral. This, he said would mitigate falling prices in securities and counteracts the effects of fire sale.", "description": "Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has hit back at calls from ANZ chief executive Shayne Elliott for a summit on low interest rates and quantitative easing, saying it's a \"distraction from the failure of big banks\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3816%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_506%2C$y_248/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/36f9af12a46fd18e085afed502f4fe2455f8953c", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
