She has a son of her own involved in oil importing from Ukraine. He even used his Mom to promote his business.\n\nBOOM: Nancy Pelosi's son Paul Pelosi Jr. (who went to Ukraine in 2017) was a board member of Viscoil and executive at its related company NRGLab, which DID ENERGY Business in UKRAINE! And Nancy Pelosi appeared in a promotional video for the company!https://t.co/wlndLhPqLe \u2014 Patrick Howley (@HowleyReporter) October 3, 2019\n\nWhen Pelosi, Jr., was asked about the purpose of his visit at the time, this is how he responded:\n\nPelosi, executive director of the Corporate Governance Initiative, was asked why he was in Kiev. \u201cToday we\u2019re here to talk about soccer,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe recently got an endorsement from the world sports alliance and we\u2019ve spoken with the Ukraine government about collaboration for soccer for young people,\u201d he said. \u201cUkraine has a great history in soccer and we hope to share in that tradition going forward.\u201d The House Minority Leader\u2019s son\u2019s work there is curious, given the Democrats\u2019 attempts to collaborate with Ukraine to attack Donald Trump.\n\nYou can see Paul Pelosi, Jr., in the video below beginning at about 0:31.\n\n2017 \u2014 What's really going on here? Nancy Pelosi's son in Ukraine to talk about \"soccer\"? pic.twitter.com/LCnF93Rgnc \u2014 The American Mirror (@American_Mirror) September 27, 2019\n\nJunior Pelosi\u2019s company, Viscoil is under investigation for securities fraud. It seems as though the public management of the company, which included Paul Pelosi, Jr., as President and COO, was actually a Potemkin arrangement that hid the fact that the company was actually controlled by a pair of convicted felons.\n\nSo now we have two major Democrats with kids involved in financial dealings in Ukraine. We also know that Ukraine was involved in trying to assist the Clinton campaign to dig up evidence of wrongdoing by Paul Manfort. My guess is that there is a lot more lurking out there once President Trump motivates what passes for law enforcement in Ukraine to start investigating in earnest.\n\n=========\n\n=========\n\nLike what you see?
