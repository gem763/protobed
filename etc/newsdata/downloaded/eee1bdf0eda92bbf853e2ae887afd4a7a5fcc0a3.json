The waterfall was closed off to visitors while officials remove the carcasses.\n\n\"The two elephants right now are taking a rest. They are exhausted from trying to cross the stream,\" said Chanaya Kanchanasaka, a veterinarian at the park, located 120 kilometers (74 miles) northeast of Bangkok.\n\nThe ravines usually fill up with gushing water during the rainy season. In 1992, eight elephants died after falling into the water.\n\nThe park is home to about 300 wild elephants and is part of Dong Phayayen-Khao Yai Forest Complex, a UNESCO World Heritage site.", "description": "A herd of wild elephants was swept away by raging waters in a national park in Thailand, drowning six, while rangers helped steer two of the animals out of a deep ravine.
