Before last week, the NOAA had been subjected to relatively few Trump administration scandals, but then our president decided to dig in on his erroneous warning that Alabama was in Hurricane Dorian\u2019s path, infamously taking a Sharpie to a National Hurricane Center map.\n\nAfter President Trump spent most of last week desperately trying to prove that there was a threat to Alabama, NOAA officials set off a bomb cyclone of outrage by releasing a statement on Friday in which they seemed to side with the president over the science and scientists that the agency supports. On Monday, it emerged that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross threatened to fire top NOAA employees after subordinates contradicted Trump by issuing factual weather information.\n\nBelow is what we know about the developing crisis at the agency, and the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing politicization of the weather.\n\nTrump\u2019s Bad Forecast and a National Weather Service Office\u2019s Effort to Correct it\n\nOn the morning of Sunday, September 1, just hours before Hurricane Dorian made landfall in the Bahamas as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms ever recorded, President Trump fired off a tweet to his more than 64 million followers listing Alabama as one of the U.S. states which \u201cwill most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d by Dorian.\n\nIn addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 1, 2019\n\nThe president was mistaken: Up-to-date NWS forecasts predicted virtually no impact on the state. At worst, in a few unlikely scenarios, a sliver of the state might have been brushed with tropical-storm-force winds from the outermost edge of the storm, but Dorian was expected remain out of range to the east.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Trump\u2019s erroneous forecast prompted a wave of calls from concerned Alabamians to the National Weather Service\u2019s office in Birmingham. Twenty minutes after Trump sent his tweet, NWS Birmingham used its Twitter account to inform the state\u2019s residents that they were not in danger. The office did not reference Trump or his tweet, but reiterated what the NWS had already forecast:\n\nAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx \u2014 NWS Birmingham (@NWSBirmingham) September 1, 2019\n\nNWS Birmingham performed a neutral and necessary public service, but the announcement was also an inconvenient government-issued truth which contradicted a pathologically incorrigible president. And within a week, someone at the NOAA tried fix that incongruity.\n\nThe NOAA\u2019s Trump-Serving Repudiation of Its Own Forecasters\n\nOn Friday night, September 6, the NOAA\u2019s communications team put out an unprecedented statement which tried to justify President Trump\u2019s increasingly desperate insistence that Alabama was threatened by Dorian. The official statement \u2014 which was conspicuously unsigned \u2014 went so far as to repudiate NWS Birmingham\u2019s effort to correct the president\u2019s misinformation, even deploying scientific jargon that was disingenuous at best.\n\nNWS Birmingham\u2019s Sunday tweet, the NOAA statement claimed, \u201cspoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\u201d\n\nThe statement also offered an equally disingenuous lifeline to the struggling president, noting that NWS and National Hurricane Center forecasts and maps had \u201cclearly demonstrated\u201d that \u201ctropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama.\u201d\n\nThis framing reflected Trump\u2019s evolving explanation for his mistake, which centered around passing the buck (he was just repeating what he had been told) and claiming Alabama could potentially have been impacted by Dorian \u2014 even though that was already very unlikely on Sunday, and that wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d tweeted. In addition, if \u2014 as the NOAA statement claimed \u2014 NHC maps had \u201cclearly demonstrated\u201d this potential impact, why did Trump need to draw a haphazard circle around Alabama with a Sharpie in the NHC map he used as an Oval Office prop?\n\nThis statement holds little weight when not a single person at NOAA has spoken on the record in favor of the president's interpretation. On Sun 9/1, the president tweeted that the threat to AL had increased. The threat to AL was going down, not up. There is a difference. https://t.co/qElkMzL3BS \u2014 Bob Henson (@bhensonweather) September 7, 2019\n\nNOAA Memos Instruct Staff Not to Contradict Trump\n\nOn Saturday night, the Washington Post reported that shortly after the NWS Birmingham assured Alabamians that they weren\u2019t in Dorian\u2019s fearsome crosshairs, \u201ca top NOAA official warned [agency] staff against contradicting the president.\u201d\n\nPer the unnamed NOAA meteorologist who spoke with the Post, the top official fired off an agency-wide directive instructing National Weather Service staffers not to \u201cprovide any opinion\u201d and to \u201conly stick with National Hurricane Center forecasts if questions arise from some national level social media posts which hit the news this afternoon.\u201d Another similar warning was sent out on September 4 after President Trump brandished his Sharpie-altered NHC forecast map where Dorian\u2019s projected path had been extended over Alabama.\n\nIn response to the report, a \u201cNWS spokesperson\u201d told the Post that \u201cNWS leadership sent this guidance to field staff so they (and the entire agency) could maintain operational focus on Dorian and other severe weather hazards without distraction.\u201d\n\nThe meteorologist who informed the Post about the directives indicated that he and others perceived a different meaning:\n\nThis is the first time I\u2019ve felt pressure from above to not say what truly is the forecast \u2026 It\u2019s hard for me to wrap my head around. One of the things we train on is to dispel inaccurate rumors and ultimately that is what was occurring \u2014 ultimately what the Alabama office did is provide a forecast with their tweet, that is what they get paid to do.\n\nOn Twitter, NBC Sports journalist Craig Calcaterra passed along a similarly shocked reaction from his father, who also worked for the NWS:\n\nTalked to my dad (40-year National Weather Service employee) about this. He and NWS message boards of past/present employees he's on have never once, ever, felt political pressure on a goddamn weather forecast. We're in true banana republic territory. https://t.co/GHSVHVOYyJ \u2014 Craig Calcaterra (@craigcalcaterra) September 8, 2019\n\nWhile NOAA\u2019s Friday statement was not attributed to a specific person, the Washington Post subsequently reported that according to an unnamed agency official, the NOAA\u2019s Trump-appointed acting administrator, Neil Jacobs, and the agency\u2019s communications director, Trump campaign veteran Julie Kay Roberts, \u201cwere involved\u201d in drafting the statement. The \ufeffPost\u2019s source also claimed that the Commerce Department, which oversees the NOAA, had approved the message \u2014 though at a time when Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was not in the country.\n\nIt is not yet clear who wrote the \u201cno opinion\u201d directives.\n\nShock, Outrage, and an Outpouring of Support for Staff at the NWS and NOAA\n\nThe anonymous NOAA statement and apparent efforts to mute pushback within the agency may have pleased the loyalty-obsessed Trump and his allies, but they triggered fierce backlash and widespread solidarity in the weather community, where the stakes were immediately clear.\n\nAs the Post\u2019s Capital Weather Gang succinctly summarized on Saturday, \u201cThe firestorm surrounding the president\u2019s hurricane statements is unprecedented in the [NOAA\u2019s] history, and threatens to politicize something that most Americans take for granted as an objective, if flawed, part of daily life: the weather forecast.\u201d\n\nThis is fascinating regarding the @NOAA memo... of every meteorologist I know and hear from, both inside & outside NOAA, 100% are against NOAA's wildly inappropriate & inaccurate memo on Friday. You can't get that % to agree on an ice cream flavor or pizza topping! #ShameOnNOAA \u2014 Brian McNoldy (@BMcNoldy) September 7, 2019\n\nThe NOAA\u2019s Friday statement was quickly and roundly criticized as an irresponsible political obfuscation by numerous well-respected meteorologists, scientists, media figures, the American Meteorological Society, and former NOAA officials. All sought to prevent the agency\u2019s hardworking forecasters \u2014 and the public\u2019s confidence in the often life-saving information they provide \u2014 from becoming collateral damage in another one of President Trump\u2019s battles with reality. Many also emphasized how outrageous it was to leverage one the NOAA\u2019s most critical assets \u2014 its credibility \u2014 in service of Trump\u2019s petty attempt to gaslight the nation.\n\n@NWSBirmingham has a brilliant staff of experienced atmospheric scientists that have helped to save countless lives in my state over the years. They were thrown under the bus today by their parent agency. I stand behind NWS Birmingham 100 percent. \u2014 James Spann (@spann) September 6, 2019\n\nThe president of the NWS labor union quickly emphasized that \u201cthe hard working employees of the NWS had nothing to do with the utterly disgusting and disingenuous [statement] sent out by NOAA management.\u201d\n\nFour former NOAA administrators from the past three presidential administrations also weighed in. Katherine Sullivan and Jane Lubchenco, who ran the agency under President Obama, and James Baker, who ran it under President Clinton, sharply criticized the capitulation and defended NWS scientists. Sullivan told the Washington Post that the NOAA statement was \u201ca major breach of scientific integrity that damages the NWS and stains the agency\u2019s leadership,\u201d particularly since there has been a long tradition at the NOAA \u201cto not let any political factors sway the scientific credibility and clarity of Weather Service forecasts and warnings.\u201d Vice Admiral Conrad Lautenbacher, who ran the agency under President George W. Bush, offered less direct criticism, announcing his \u201ccomplete faith\u201d in NWS employees instead.\n\nFormer NOAA chief operating officer David Titley, a political appointee under President Obama, was far more direct:\n\nPerhaps the darkest day ever for @noaa leadership. Don\u2019t know how they will ever look their workforce in the eye again. Moral cowardice. \u2014 David Titley (@dwtitley) September 6, 2019\n\nGOP-appointed former NWS director Elbert \u201cJoe\u201d Friday commented that \u201crewriting history to satisfy an ego diminishes [the] NOAA,\u201d and former NHC director Bill Read called the Friday statement \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and was the first to reveal that agency employees had apparently been barred from commenting on the issue.\n\nAnother former NOAA official, Monica Medina, went so far as call for a congressional investigation into who authorized the unattributed statement.\n\nWhen I was @NOAA Principal Deputy we started actively using the @NOAA handle and got the @NWS on twitter. We knew its speed sharing info would save lives. The integrity of its tweets matters. Local forecast offices MUST be able to correct misinformation without fear of reprisal. \u2014 Monica Medina (@MonicaMedinaDC) September 7, 2019\n\nAnd despite being instructed to withhold their opinions on the matter, some NWS staffers chose to speak out anyway:\n\nI am proud to work for @NWS. You will not find a more dedicated bunch, committed to saving lives and helping communities. But I am utterly disappointed and embarrassed by our parent agency\u2019s actions today. The damage done to relationships built on trust is worrisome at best. pic.twitter.com/LXnevXiTkz \u2014 Elizabeth Leitman (@WxLiz) September 6, 2019\n\nThey were soon joined by some of the highest career officials within the agency.\n\nNOAA\u2019s Chief Scientist Criticizes Agency Leaders \u2014 and Vows to Investigate\n\nIn a Sunday email to NOAA employees, which was obtained by the Washington Post, the agency\u2019s chief acting scientist, Craig McLean, joined the backlash and announced that he would be launching an investigation into the NOAA statement, which he seemed to confirm was politically motivated:\n\nThe NWS [Birmingham] Forecaster(s) corrected any public misunderstanding in an expert and timely way, as they should \u2026 There followed, last Friday, an unsigned press release from \u2018NOAA\u2019 that inappropriately and incorrectly contradicted the NWS forecaster. My understanding is that this intervention to contradict the forecaster was not based on science but on external factors including reputation and appearance, or simply put, political.\n\nMcLean, who is also an attorney, announced that he was investigating the issue as \u201cpotential violations of our NOAA Administrative Order on Scientific Integrity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe content of this press release is very concerning as it compromises the ability of NOAA to convey life-saving information necessary to avoid substantial and specific danger to public health and safety,\u201d McLean wrote. \u201cIf the public cannot trust our information, or we debase our forecaster\u2019s warnings and products, that specific danger arises.\u201d\n\nThe NWS Director Bucks NOAA Leadership, Backs Forecasters\n\nWow! What a powerful moment and moving show of support with a standing ovation for WFO Birmingham. Thank you @NWSDirector! #NWAS19 pic.twitter.com/PDXz0TrZOa \u2014 Rick Smith (@ounwcm) September 9, 2019\n\nThe \u201cofficial\u201d NOAA repudiation on Friday also drew a rebuke from National Weather Service director Louis Uccellini. Monday, at a weather industry conference, in Alabama of all places, Uccellini offered his unwavering support to NWS Birmingham\u2019s forecasters in a speech to hundreds of meteorologists:\n\nThey did what any office would do. With an emphasis they deemed essential, they shut down what they thought were rumors. They quickly acted to reassure their partners, the media and the public \u2014 with strong language \u2014 that there was no threat. They did that with one thing in mind: public safety. And they responded not knowing where this information was coming from. Only later, [when] the retweets and the politically-based comments came into their office, did they learn the source of this information.\n\nUccellini received a standing ovation.\n\nWilbur Ross\u2019s Threat to Fire Top NOAA Employees\n\nOn Monday afternoon, the New York Times revealed disturbing details about the origin of the mysteriously unsigned NOAA statement. The paper reported that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had gone so far as to threaten firings at the agency if it did not do something to address its initial contradiction of President Trump\u2019s Alabama forecast. Ross laid out his demand to Neil Jacobs, a political appointee who is the acting administrator of NOAA. Jacobs reportedly pushed back, but evidently backed down in the end.\n\nIn response to the news, multiple Democratic members of Congress called for Ross\u2019s resignation.", "description": "After President Trump spent much of last week desperately trying to prove that Hurricane Dorian was a threat to Alabama, the NOAA found itself in the crosshairs of his administration.", "authors": ["Chas Danner"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/09/09-trump-dorian-tim-obrien-illo-hp.w1200.h630.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
