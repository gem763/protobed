As a self-admitted emotional-eater, she decided that instead of turning to her usual crutch, she\u2019d turn to exercise as a coping mechanism. \u201cWhilst it started out as a desperate distraction, little did I know I had embarked on a [fitness] journey of self-discovery, healing, and growth,\u201d she recalls.\n\nHere\u2019s how it went.\n\nYolandi Stegmann\n\nOccupation: Lead payroll\n\nLead payroll Age: 35\n\n35 City: Cape Town\n\nCape Town Weight before: 86kg\n\n86kg Weight after: 73kg\n\n73kg Height: 1,76m\n\n1,76m The time required to reach current weight: 10 months\n\n10 months The secret weapon to her weight loss: Every day is a new opportunity\n\nThe Gain\n\n\u201cMy weight has always fluctuated,\u201d Yolandi admits.
