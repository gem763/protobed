He pleaded not guilty Tuesday afternoon.\n\nProsecutors say Mr. Palma, senior manager of diesel driveability and emissions at Fiat Chrysler, misled regulators about engine emissions from 104,000 diesel vehicles.\n\nThey say Mr. Palma and unidentified co-conspirators installed software in Ram 1500 pickups and Jeep Grand Cherokees produced between 2014 and 2016 to skirt emissions tests. The software manipulated the autos\u2019 emissions during testing so that the vehicles looked as if they were releasing fewer emissions than they actually did on the road.\n\nThe indictment also says in June 2016, Mr. Palma and the co-conspirators \u201cmade and caused others to make false and misleading representation\u201d to federal regulators so the cars could be sold in the United States.\n\n\u201cCheating government regulators, customers, and the public for increased sales and compensation will be prosecuted by the Department of Justice to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\n\nFiat Chrysler said in a statement it will cooperate with investigators\n\n\u201cWe will continue to fully cooperate with the authorities as we have throughout this issue,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe company this year agreed to pay more than $800 million to civil penalties arising from the scandal. That included more than $400 million it paid to the Justice Department in January to settle a civil lawsuit.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
