That number has since surged to as many as 2,300 estimated pairs of the birds, according to officials.\n\nHabitat destruction remains a top issue for the birds, which roost in rural northern Michigan during the spring and summer before heading for the Bahamas when the weather changes.\n\nAn official with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) told the AP that recent destruction caused by a hurricane in the Bahamas did not appear to severely impact nesting areas for the warbler.\n\n\u201cHurricanes have occurred before in the Bahamas and we\u2019ve never detected any kind of population impacts to the species,\u201d Scott Hicks told the AP.", "description": "The Trump administration announced Tuesday that a songbird once threatened to the point of near-extinction has rebounded to the point where federal protections are no longer necessary.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/interiordepartment_100919getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
