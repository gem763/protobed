The crowd at Yankee Stadium rose and roared, hoping for a go-ahead drive.\n\n\u201cI think every flyball in 2019 is a homer,\u201d Houston manager AJ Hinch said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of been conditioned that way.\u201d\n\nGregorius stood at the plate, watching, then took some tentative steps toward first base as Josh Reddick gloved the ball a step in front of the right-field wall, 343 feet away.\n\n\u201cI missed it,\u201d Gregorius said. \u201cI know I didn\u2019t have all of it.\u201d\n\nNew York stranded nine during a 4-1 loss to Houston on Tuesday night that put the Yankees in a 2-1 AL Championship Series deficit, going 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position.\n\nGregorius, who hit a grand slam against Minnesota in the previous playoff round, left the bases loaded in the first when he hit an inning-ending groundout - also on the first pitch. He went 0 for 4 and saw just six pitches after averaging 4.01 per plate appearance during the regular season.\n\n\u201cMost of the game was on me,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t come through, so I was the one that failed, not the whole team.\u201d\n\nNew York averaged 4.06 pitches per plate appearance during the regular season, second to Seattle\u2019s 4.11. But the Yankees had a hyper-aggressive approach on Cole, with Aaron Judge, Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n and Gregorius hitting the first pitch in the opening inning. Encarnaci\u00f3n also saw just one pitch in the third.\n\n\u201cI felt like tonight a little bit, and even me especially, chased a lot of stuff out of the zone,\u201d Judge said. \u201cWhen you chase stuff out of the zone with the type of caliber pitching they\u2019ve got, especially what Gerrit Cole has been doing, you\u2019re going to be in trouble. So the thing is just us, just regrouping and getting back to staying in our zone. That\u2019s all we need to do.\u201d\n\nNew York had three singles and a double in seven innings against Cole. Gleyber Torres homered off Joe Smith in the eighth in what turned out to be the Yankees\u2019 final hit.\n\nGregorius (1 for 12), Encarnaci\u00f3n (1 for 12), Gary S\u00e1nchez (1 for 13), Brett Gardner (2 for 13) and DJ LeMahieu (5 for 13) haven\u2019t driven in a run.\n\nS\u00e1nchez who hit 34 home runs this season, has no RBIs in six postseason games. Judge, Encarnaci\u00f3n and once-again injured Giancarlo Stanton have just two RBIs each, and Gio Urshela one.\n\n\u201cCertainly you don\u2019t want to allow a lot of pitchers, but certainly great pitchers, to just get ahead with ease,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cSo I think guys were up there being aggressive.\u201d\n\nCole got Judge to flail at a low and away slider , stranding two with an inning-ending strikeout in the second.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I got one pitch over the heart of the plate,\u201d Judge said. \u201cWhen that happens, you kind of get frustrated and kind of chase a little bit.\u201d\n\nLeMahieu flied to deep center ending the fourth and leaving two more on,\n\n\u201cI always think it\u2019s important to go in there on the hunt, especially when you\u2019re up against a good pitcher,\u201d Boone said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just give great pitchers strike one.\u201d\n\nPROVIDING 0\n\nReliever Adam Ottavino has allowed six hits and three walks while facing 16 batters in the postseason. With New York trailing 2-0, he walked George Springer leading off the seventh and allowed a single to Jos\u00e9 Altuve. Zack Britton relieved and two runs scored on a wild pitch and Yuli Gurriel\u2019s sacrifice fly .\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to let it define me. I\u2019m not going to dwell on a couple pitches here and there,\u201d Ottavino said. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s frustrating, and those are the types of games I want to be in. It\u2019s the reason I came to this team and everything I wanted my whole life. So I want to do better. I want to get out there again.\u201d\n\nBAD BEHAVIOR\n\nRestless Yankees fans threw debris on the field when a replay review changed Encarnaci\u00f3n\u2019s infield hit leading off the eighth to a groundout. They cheered when Luis Cessa hit Alex Bregman on the back with a 92 mph fastball in the ninth.\n\n\u201cYou throw a baseball hard enough and hit somebody in the head when they\u2019re not looking. It could do some damage to the player, so it\u2019s definitely disrespectful and at the same time very unsafe,\u201d Reddick said. \u201cThere\u2019s no place in baseball for that. It\u2019s disrespectful and unsafe.\u201d\n\nWEATHER PLANS\n\nBoone said if Game 4 is pushed back to Thursday because of rain, the Yankees likely would start Game 1 winner Masahiro Tanaka on normal rest rather than go with an all-bullpen effort as originally planned.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Didi Gregorius turned on a first-pitch fastball from Gerrit Cole with two on and two outs in the fifth inning and sent it soaring toward the right-field seats.
