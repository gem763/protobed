He was 84.\n\nTaylor died Sunday in Beverly Hills, California, publicist Harlan Boll said.\n\nThe man who would become known worldwide as Rip did not have a direct line into show business. He was born Charles Elmer Taylor Jr. in Washington, D.C., to a waitress and a musician and first worked as a congressional page before serving in the Army during the Korean War, where he started performing standup.\n\nHis ascent began with spots on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show,\u201d where he was known as the \u201ccrying comedian.\u201d The moniker pre-dated his television stints, however, and went back to his time in the Catskills.\n\n\u201cI sat on a stool telling jokes, and nobody was laughing,\u201d he told UPI in 1992. \u201cIn desperation, I pretended to cry as I begged them to laugh. That killed \u2018em.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s where he said the character \u201cRip\u201d came from.\n\nAlthough he readily admitted stealing jokes from USO shows, the crying comedian bit got him to Ed Sullivan, where the host - forgetting Taylor\u2019s name - would say \u201cget me the crying comedian.\u201d\n\nSuccess begat more success, and Taylor ended up on tour with Judy Garland and Eleanor Powell in Las Vegas in 1966.\n\nIn his over five decades in entertainment, Taylor would make over 2,000 guest star appearances on shows like \u201cThe Monkees,\u201d \u201dThe Merv Griffin Show,\u201d \u201dThe Tonight Show,\u201d \u201dLate Night with David Letterman,\u201d \u201dHollywood Squares\u201d and \u201cThe Gong Show.\u201d He also hosted the beauty pageant spoof \u201cThe $1.98 Beauty Show.\u201d\n\nWith his bushy blonde toupee, exaggerated eyebrows and walrus-like mustache, Taylor was a striking presence. He was apparently so proud of his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame that he\u2019d regularly schedule trips to buff and clean the square at 6625 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nTaylor also did a fair share of voice work for animated films and television like \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d and \u201cThe Addams Family,\u201d as Uncle Fester, which earned him an Emmy nomination.\n\nHe played himself in movies like \u201cWayne\u2019s World 2\u201d and the \u201cJackass\u201d movies, appeared on stage in \u201cAnything Goes,\u201d \u201dA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,\u201d \u201dSugar Babies,\u201d where he took over for Mickey Rooney, as Fagin in \u201cOliver!\u201d and Captain Hook in \u201cPeter Pan.\u201d Taylor also wrote and performed an autobiographical one-man play called \u201cIt Ain\u2019t All Confetti.\u201d\n\nTaylor reflected in that same 1992 interview that he always considered himself an actor.\n\n\u201cRip is funny because he\u2019s crazy. Every night on stage, he\u2019s cornered and put-upon,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I am bringing into play as a straight actor.\u201d\n\nHe is survived by his longtime partner Robert Fortney. In lieu of flowers, they ask that donations be made to the Thalians, a charitable organization that Taylor supported that is dedicated to mental health issues.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Rip Taylor, the madcap mustached comedian with a fondness for confetti-throwing who became a television game show mainstay in the 1970s, has died.
