I guess in two or three weeks he is running again. The medical staff are working really well.'\n\nDeeney is not Sanchez Flores' only injury concern as he attempts to turn the Hornets' season around.\n\nWatford are still to win this season and are bottom of the table with just three points from eight games.\n\nWatford boss Quique Sanchez Flores has admitted he has several injury problems\n\nEtienne Capoue, Sebastian Prodl and Isaac Success will also miss Saturday's trip to Tottenham.\n\n'We have Capoue, Deeney, Prodl and Success out, but we try to find a good solution,' said Sanchez Flores, speaking at a press conference shown on the club's official website.\n\n'This is our mentality. We have others ready to play. We cannot depend on one player. We have lots of players with high quality and skill.'", "description": "Watford coach Quique Sanchez Flores has suggested captain Troy Deeney could be back in action before the end of next month.", "authors": ["Andy Hampson", "Press Association Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/20/19854448-0-image-a-13_1571341230946.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
