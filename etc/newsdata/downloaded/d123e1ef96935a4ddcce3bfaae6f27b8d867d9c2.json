The paste that holds him together is a mixture of bluff, myth, and his opponents\u2019 insecurity. In the 1980s, according to The New York Times, he scammed investors by pretending to be a corporate raider. He would purchase a bunch of shares in a company, leak a rumor that he planned to take it over, then sell the shares after they rose. He played on the twin myths that he was good at business and had the competence to take over major companies\u2014and he bet that investors would be too sheepish to question either one. It worked, for a while. But investors eventually got wise and Trump lost $35 million.\n\nThe same thing is finally happening in Washington, D.C.\n\nTrump seems to have thought he was in the clear. The day after former FBI Director Robert Mueller testified to Congress and House Democrats made clear that they still had no intention of impeaching him, Trump called Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and pressed him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. What he didn\u2019t realize was that some Democrats, as Bloomberg reported, \u201cregret their timidity on Mueller report and think it signaled to president that he was above accountability.\u201d So when the Ukraine news broke, Democrats didn\u2019t hesitate. More than 20\u2014including prominent hold-outs\u2014came out for impeachment overnight. Ignoring White House spin that nothing inappropriate was said on the call to Zelenksy, Democrats pushed aggressively for a call record and the full whistleblower complaint to be released. When they were, Democrats didn\u2019t hesitate to call the contents what they were: a smoking gun.\n\nThe lesson is that pressure works against Trump. His decision to release the call record and whistleblower report was a massive mistake, one that was hotly debated within the White House, according to the Washington Post. But when you apply pressure, you force your opponent to make mistakes.\n\nNow that a majority of the House supports impeachment, Democrats should plan a process that exerts maximum pressure on Senate Republicans. They have largely escaped the limelight and benefited from the assumption that they\u2019ll vote against removing President Trump. But that assumption deserves scrutiny: even if they do, the vote is likely to be messy, painful, and cost them dearly in 2020. There is a lot of uncertainty ahead, but here\u2019s what a process that puts a squeeze on Senate Republicans could look like.\n\nFirst, Democrats should immediately start hammering home the fact that if the House votes to impeach Trump, he is impeached. The two-front war against impeachment from right and left muddied this message and it needs to be re-emphasized. Article one, Section two of the Constitution states that the House \u201cshall have the sole Power of Impeachment.\u201d The Senate only gets to decide what to do with Trump. Neither of the two presidents in American history to be impeached were removed from office by the Senate, but history regards them as having been impeached. Establishing this principle early is important.\n\nSecond, House Democrats would be wise to keep the scope of the inquiry focused on the Ukraine news. There is some disagreement about whether to open a more sprawling inquiry on the left, but the most important goals here are to impeach this president and send the most compelling possible case to the Senate. The Ukraine news is damning, clear as day, and impossible to explain away. And it provides a rock-solid foundation for a story about a president who extorted the power of his office for personal gain, and tried to cover it up when he got caught. The Mueller report provides important context and establishes a pattern of behavior, including the President\u2019s efforts to obstruct justice and Congressional investigations, and can be included to help tell the story.\n\nVenturing farther afield risks giving Senate Republicans a credible way to divert the conversation and avoid being pressed relentlessly on Ukraine. There is plenty of time for other hearings on Trump\u2019s many crimes, including sexual assault and financial corruption. But Al Capone went to jail for tax evasion, not murder. And the important thing is to impeach this motherfucker.\n\nThird, the length of the hearings shouldn\u2019t be artificially shortened or prolonged\u2014it should be determined by a simple test: are we driving the news? Do we have control of the narrative? If so, keep going. If not, wrap it up and vote. When impeachment hearings begin, they will generate wall-to-wall coverage. But over time, if they stop generating news, the coverage will wane and Democrats will open themselves up to charges of leading a fishing expedition. Unlike Watergate, where the investigation led to the release of the Nixon tapes, the evidence of Trump\u2019s impeachable crimes is already public. It would be a shame to end hearings prematurely and forego new evidence of this or other crimes, especially since the whistleblower complaint clearly implicates Attorney General Barr and other White House staff. But it would be malpractice to lose control of the narrative.", "description": "The Ukraine news is damning, and House Democrats should plan a process that exerts maximum pressure on Senate Republicans.", "authors": ["Adam Jentleson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dHaD8AYwTLc7DYLykAHCRg--~B/aD0xMTI1O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/gq_402/59a4c465d439436fb4e4a27106c3cfd7", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
