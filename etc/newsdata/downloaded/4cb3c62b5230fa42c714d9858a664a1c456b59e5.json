Joe Manchin said Tuesday. | Tyler Evert Congress Joe Manchin skips run for governor The decision is likely to be a relief to Senate Democrats, who would ultimately struggle to hold on to the West Virginia seat.\n\nJoe Manchin will not run for governor of West Virginia in 2020, the Democratic senator announced Tuesday.\n\nThe decision is likely to be a relief to Democrats, who would struggle to hold on to the seat in the future, and keeps one of the few remaining centrists in the Senate.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe move comes after months of Manchin flirting with a gubernatorial bid against Republican Gov. Jim Justice and complaining about Washington gridlock.\n\n\u201cWhen considering whether to run for governor, I couldn\u2019t focus just on which job I enjoyed the most, but on where I could be the most effective for the Mountain State,\u201d Manchin said in a statement.\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Manchin noted his senior positions on the Energy and Appropriations panels: \"I get to set policy. I get to make sure that West Virginia is not left out.\"\n\nManchin would not have had to give up his Senate seat to run and would have appointed his replacement if elected governor. Democrats, however, would have had difficulty keeping the seat when it would have been up for grabs in 2022.\n\nManchin faced a real challenge for his Senate reelection bid in 2018, beating GOP Attorney General Patrick Morrisey by 3 percentage points.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Trump won West Virginia by 42 points in 2016.\n\nBut a MetroNews Dominion Post West Virginia Poll last week showed that Manchin could beat Justice in a race for governor. The poll found that in a hypothetical matchup, 49 percent said they\u2019d support Manchin, compared with 39 percent for Justice. Twelve percent were undecided.\n\nManchin supported Justice\u2019s run for governor in 2016 when Justice was a Democrat; Justice, who was formerly a Republican, announced he had switched back to the GOP at a rally with Trump just months after he was elected governor.\n\nManchin told reporters he had not received pressure from national Democrats on the decison and said he announced his choice now to give others time to weigh a campaign.\n\nManchin signaled earlier this year that he was considering a run against Justice. In an April interview with POLITICO, Manchin said being governor of West Virginia was the \u201cbest job in the world.\u201d\n\nIn his statement Tuesday, Manchin described being governor as the \u201cgreatest of honor of my life,\u201d but added that he could do more for West Virginia in the Senate.\n\nManchin pledged to use his role as the top Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to push for energy technology legislation and said he would continue to fight to protect pensions for West Virginia's miners and to ensure health coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nManchin is one of the few moderates left in the Senate, and his decision will keep a key swing vote in the upper chamber.\n\n\"There\u2019s nobody trying to find the middle. Everybody is going for the sides, if you will, for the extremes,\" he told reporters. \"It\u2019s not how you get things done.\"\n\nLast year, Manchin crossed party lines and voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. He\u2019s also previously endorsed Republican colleague Susan Collins of Maine, who is facing a tough race for reelection in 2020.\n\nManchin has also partnered with Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) on legislation to expand background checks to all commercial sales, a proposal that has garnered renewed attention amid a wave of mass shootings this summer.\n\nAnd he promised to continue to work with Trump when he can.\n\n\u201cAs I have done since coming to Washington, I will work with the president to accomplish what best serves our state and our country and I will speak truth to power when I don\u2019t agree with the path the President has chosen to take \u2014 that is what West Virginians elected me to do!\u201d Manchin said in his statement.\n\nJames Arkin contributed to this report.", "description": "The decision is likely to be a relief to Senate Democrats, who would ultimately struggle to hold on to the West Virginia seat.", "authors": ["Marianne Levine"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e7/0e/ee16a27c42808b0009aac8716c0d/190903-joe-manchin-ap-773.jpg"}
