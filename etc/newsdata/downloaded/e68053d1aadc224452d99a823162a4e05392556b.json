USA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 The Houston Astros clubhouse was nearly empty and the music silenced, when Gerrit Cole, dressed in front of his locker, threw his hair back, tied it with a rubber band, closed his eyes, and exhaled.\n\n\u201cThat was hairy,\u2019\u2019 he told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cThat was real hairy.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe New York Yankees were bidding to not only become the first team in five months to beat Cole, but perhaps even knock him out in the first inning at Yankee Stadium.\n\nBy the end of the night, they were the ones screaming in sheer anguish, letting Cole escape danger time and time again, losing the pivotal game 4-1.\n\nThe Yankees know that the only way they can win this best-of-seven American League Championship Series is by beating co-aces Justin Verlander and Cole at least once.\n\nWell, they\u2019re now 0-for-2 against the Cy Young favorites, and may spend the winter haunted by the game they could have won.\n\nGAME 3: Reddick calls out Yankees fans for throwing things on the field\n\nWORLD SERIES: Nationals overcome past failures to reach first Fall Classic\n\nCole, who has not lost a game since May 22, barely resembled the guy who has annihilated opposing lineups.\n\nHe walked a career-high five batters.\n\nIt took him 11 batters to notch his first strikeout, and wound up with only seven strikeouts , his fewest since Aug. 1, ending a record streak of 11 consecutive starts with 10 more strikeouts.\n\n\u201cThat was the most impressive thing of all,\u2019\u2019 right fielder Josh Reddick, who homered in the second inning, \u201cthat he didn\u2019t have this best stuff, and he put up zeroes.\n\n\u201cIt shows you how good and gifted he is as a pitcher.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Yankees had a chance to end Cole\u2019s mystique in the first inning, only for Cole to survive, and be able to laugh it off hours later.\n\nGerrit Cole talks with Carlos Correa and Martin Maldonado during the first inning.

LeMahieu single that went through Cole\u2019s legs.\n\nIt was no big deal until Aaron Judge followed by hitting a soft grounder to second base. Cole thought he had a double play ball but he spun around and was horrified. The Astros were in a shift, and there was no one between first and second base. The ball lazily rolled into the outfield for a hit.\n\n\u201cI was like, 'Come on, man, give me a break!' \u2019\u2019 Cole said. \u201cYou kidding me?\u2019\u2019\n\nThe sellout crowd stood on its feet. They tried to break him right there.\n\n\u201cThat was a 10-pound bowling ball from Aaron Judge,\u2019\u2019 Verlander said, \u201cthat gets through the infield with nobody out. It could have been a double-play ball.\n\n\u201cThose are the things that if you let it get to you, it snowballs quickly, especially in this environment.\u2019\u2019\n\nCole, taking a deep breath, quickly settled down. He got Brett Gardner to hit a fly ball to center field. Edwin Encarnacion popped up to second base. But then he walked Gleyber Torres on four pitches, loading the bases for Didi Gregorius.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m there just thinking, 'Don\u2019t throw him a first-pitch heater,' \" Reddick said. \u201c \u201cPlease, don\u2019t throw the first-pitch heater. He lives for that.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nCole, believing that Gregorius was ready to come out of his shoes if he threw a first-pitch fastball, pulled out an 82-mph curveball.\n\n\u201cIt was the first one I threw all game,\u2019\u2019 Cole said, shaking his head. \u201cI bounced like 15 of them in the bullpen [before the game]. But I said, \u201cLet\u2019s just throw that because if I bounce it, it will look like a fastball, and he swings at those.\u2019\u2019\n\nInstead, the curveball ran inside and jammed Gregorius,, resulting in a lazy ground ball to second base for the final out.\n\nCrisis averted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you why we threw the pitch,\u2019\u2019 catcher Martin Maldonado said, \u201cbut it was the biggest pitch of the game.\n\n\u201cReally, it was the pitch.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut the Yankees kept at it.\n\nThey had two runners on and two outs in the second inning, only for Cole to strike out Judge on a 90-mph slider.\n\nIn the fourth, Cole lost his control and walked back-to-back batters on nine pitchers , only for LeMahieu to line out to center field.\n\nIn the fifth inning, he had to wait for nearly 35 minutes before he even took the mound.\n\nHome-plate umpire Jeff Nelson left the game with a concussion after being hit in the fourth inning, and there was a 17-minute delay for Kerwin Danley to put on his home-plate equipment. Then, Cole had to wait even longer as the Astros got a couple of runners on and the Yankees made a pitching change.\n\n\u201cThat was the most impressive thing to me,\u2019\u2019 Astros third baseman Alex Bregman said, \u201cdealing with that long layoff and still being able to go deep (into the game).\u2019\u2019\n\nSure enough, the Yankees would threaten in the fifth, putting two runners on base when Gregorius again stepped to the plate with the chance to make a difference. He jumped on Cole\u2019s first-pitch, 99-mph fastball and sent it deep to right, only for the ball to die just before the fence into Reddick's waiting glove.\n\nIt was the last time the Yankees would threaten, with Cole retiring the final seven batters he faced, departing after seven innings and 112 pitches, leaving the bullpen to finish the job.\n\n\u201cThat first inning, with everything going on, and to be able to shut it down,\u2019\u2019 Verlander said, \u201cthat was the most impressive thing to me. Only the second time pitching at Yankee Stadium. The whole environment. Everything. Just to be able to fight that noise and get out of the first.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd, yes, to walk five batters and live to tell about it.\n\n\u201cIt's obviously a little frustrating we weren't able to break through with him,\u2019\u2019 Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cAny time you're facing a guy like that, you want that kind of traffic. And we had that in several innings. He made big pitches when he had to.\"\n\nThe Yankees certainly made Cole work all night, but when all they needed a big hit, they couldn\u2019t get it.\n\n\u201cIt seems like those guys are all locked in,\u2019\u2019 Verlander said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make really good pitches to get them out.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut how do you explain those five walks when he hadn\u2019t walked more than three in a game all season?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s postseason baseball,\u2019\u2019 Verlander said. \u201cYou never want to give in. In the regular season, I\u2019m sure you go, 'OK, hit it.\u2019 But in the playoffs, you\u2019re not afforded that luxury, especially in a 0-0, 1-1, 2-0 game. Those runs are huge.\n\n\u201cI think when you start stretching [the lead] to three or four runs, you\u2019re able to be more effective in the strike zone.\u2019\u2019\n\nNow, Cole won\u2019t be needed again until Game 7.\n\nOr Game 1 of the World Series.\n\n\u201cAny time you can target another day for him to pitch,\u2019\u2019 Astros manager A.J. Hinch said, \u201cit feels pretty good. There\u2019s a lot of baseball left to play before that factors in.\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s the best pitcher in baseball right now.\n\n\u201cTo see him do it on the big stage with the magnitude of this game was pretty awesome.\u2019\u2019", "description": "The Yankees loaded the bases in the first inning and missed out on numerous other opportunities against the Astros starter, who walked five.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published A.M.
