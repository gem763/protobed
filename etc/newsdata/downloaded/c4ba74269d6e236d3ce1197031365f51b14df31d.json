Newly-elected European Commission head, Ursula von der Leyen, has requested a replacement.\n\nDancila \u2014 whose PSD has been in power since late 2016 but has seen massive protests over controversial judicial reforms \u2014 is also due to run in presidential elections with the first round scheduled for November 10.\n\nIncumbent centre-right President Iohannis already looks set to be re-elected for a second term, and the collapse of Dancila\u2019s government will weaken her chances even further.\n\nIohannis will now consult parties before appointing a new prime minister to run the poor, corruption-plagued EU member until legislative elections scheduled for the end of next year.\n\n\u201cThis government must go. A new government that will ensure an orderly transition until the next legislative elections will be formed,\u201d Iohannis, a vocal PSD critic, said late Wednesday.\n\nUndermined by internal dissent, the opposition has so far failed to agree on an alternative candidate to Dancila.\n\nOne option is former transport minister Ludovic Orban, leader of the Liberals, which Iohannis used to head, but he enjoys far from unanimous backing.\n\nThe new government will have the delicate task of writing the budget for 2020, complicated by an explosion of public spending in recent months as the PSD struggles to stay in power.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has already warned that Romania risks surpassing the three percent public deficit ceiling imposed by the EU, urging Bucharest to give up on a PSD promise of doubling pensions by 2022.", "description": "Bucharest (AFP) \u2013 Romania\u2019s beleaguered left-wing government collapsed in a no-confidence vote Thursday, paving the way for the president to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/69dd1a_romanian-prime-minister-viorica-dancila-beleaguered-left-wing-government-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
