The meeting was canceled before it could take place, but critics want to know why it was planned so close to 9/11 and at camp David at all. The president tonight now says negotiations with the Taliban are dead. And as we reported from Afghanistan this year, the U.S. Has been negotiating with the Taliban for a peace agreement in Afghanistan to bring U.S. Troops home. Here's ABC's chief white house correspondent Jonathan Karl. Reporter: President trump today declared talks with the Taliban to end the war in Afghanistan aren't just postponed, they're dead.

They thought that hay had to kill people in order to put themselves in a little better negotiating position.

And it is unclear how you achieve those two aims without some sort of peace agreement. David? Jon Karl with us live from North Carolina.
