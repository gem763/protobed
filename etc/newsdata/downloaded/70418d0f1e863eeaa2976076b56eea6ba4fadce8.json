In March 2016, then-Vice President Biden pressured the Ukranian government to fire Shokin, who was investigating Burisma Holdings.\n\nEarlier this month, Biden told Fox News that he never discussed his son\u2019s foreign business dealings. But a new photo obtained by Fox News' \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" shows Biden and his son golfing in the Hamptons with Devon Archer, who served on the board of Burisma Holdings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now a running theme on the Left and the media. Everything they accuse the President of -- they themselves are guilty of doing. You want clear evidence of a quid pro quo? OK, look no further than sleepy, creepy, crazy, Uncle Joe. He\u2019s bragging about it,\u201d said Hannity, referencing a video of Biden claiming credit for the firing of Shokin at a 2018 Council of Foreign Relations event.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nHannity continued, claiming that Democrats are now fast-tracking an impeachment investigation because they saw Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation as a failure.\n\n\u201cNow, a second witch hunt, after three years of the first witch hunt. Four investigations, no collusion. Well, they now started on another one. But they\u2019re not going to make the same mistake which is \u2018Oh, we\u2019re not going to wait three years and then get disappointed in the end when it doesn\u2019t come out the way we thought it was going to come out,\u2019\u201d said Hannity.\n\nAlso last night, Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham accused Democrats of attempting to reverse the will of the American voter by seeking to remove President Donald Trump from office.\n\nOn \"The Ingraham Angle,\" Ingraham said Democrats are setting a dangerous precedent.\n\nIngraham, \u201cTheir choice to weaponize impeachment is all the proof you need of their aversion to democratic rule... The \u2018Nancy-Ocasio-Pelosi Democrats\u2019 see the voters as speedbumps on the way to the progressive promised land. But watch out kids, because these speed bumps have spikes, and if your party stay on this anti-democratic road you won\u2019t just lose a tire, you\u2019re going to blow an axle.\u201d\n\nLEWANDOWSKI SAYS MEDIA IMPEACHMENT PUSH WILL BACKFIRE\n\nFinally, Carlson ripped the President's opponents with a tongue in cheek takedown.\n\nCarlson, \u201cFor just about three years since the day Donald Trump was inaugurated, the Left has worked tirelessly to end his administration by non-democratic means if necessary \u2013 very much including impeachment. They are closer than ever to reaching that goal and yet \u2026 they don\u2019t appear very happy about it. In fact, the closer impeachment gets the more despondent they seem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey had such high hopes for President Trump. They want you to know that. They saw his potential \u2013 sure they could be mildly critical from time to time \u2013 but only in the most loving way, as a parent corrects a child... Sometimes you have to overturn a democracy, in order to save a democracy,\" concluded Carlson.\n\nTo see the full daily segment and for more from your favorite Fox News hosts, sign up to Fox Nation and watch \"Primetime Highlights\" daily.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only for Fox Nation subscribers.
