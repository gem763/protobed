The original, the biggest September release ever, had earned more than $200 million at the same point two years ago.\n\n\u201cHustlers,\u201d riding stellar reviews, film-festival buzz and Oscar talk for Lopez, earned $33.2 million, a record for a film from STX Entertainment, which was launched less than five years ago.\n\nThe film, budgeted at just $20 million, became the rare recent hit that was neither a sequel nor a reboot nor part of a series. It was also the biggest opening ever for a live-action Lopez film, and had numbers comparable to co-star Constance Wu\u2019s hit \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d whose long-term box office success could be a model for \u201cHustlers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is exactly the kind of movie that every studio dreams of producing, because it\u2019s going to be profitable, prestigious and a long-term performer,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cA lot of original type movies that are non-franchise non-sequels, many of them have had a rough go this year. This is a nice counter-balance to that.\u201d\n\nBased on a New York magazine piece, \u201cHustlers,\u201d written and directed by Lorene Scafaria, tells the true story of a group of New York City strippers who, put out by the recession\u2019s effects on their Wall Street patrons, start a side con that involves drugging their wealthy marks and running up exorbitant credit card bills that they get a cut of.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t look at it as a stripper movie,\u201d said STX Motion Picture Group Chairman Adam Fogelson. \u201cWe looked at it as a crime movie, not unlike something like \u2018Wolf of Wall Street.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven with its buzz, industry projections had the film making about $25 million over the weekend, but it appealed to an even wider audience than expected.\n\n\u201cIt definitely skewed female as we always expected, but it was very diverse as far as ethnic groups, and it brought in a broad range of ages for an R-rated film,\u201d Fogelson said.\n\nAnd with its strong word-of-mouth and the forthcoming season of awards and end-of-year top 10 lists, it could keep bringing in the dollar bills for months.\n\n\u201cThis is a movie that everyone is talking about,\u201d Fogelson said.\n\n\u201cAngel Has Fallen,\u201d starring Gerard Butler, was a distant third with $4.4 million, and has brought in $60.4 million in its four weeks of release.\n\nThe week\u2019s other new release, \u201cThe Goldfinch,\u201d landed with a thud, bringing in just $2.6 million. The adaptation of Donna Tartt\u2019s acclaimed 2013 novel, starring Ansel Elgort, got reviews as dreary as those of \u201cHustlers\u201d were strong.\n\n\u201cIt: Chapter Two\u201d was hardly a slouch, despite underperforming compared to the 2017 original. Bringing in more than $150 million in two weeks during usually-dead September is a rare achievement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a massive number,\u201d said Dergarabedian. \u201cThe \u2018It\u2019 franchise has now done over a billion dollars worldwide. That first film was really lightning in a bottle.\u201d\n\n___\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.
