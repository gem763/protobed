The \u2018ballad queen\u2019 sang in Pyongyang last year as part of the South Korean art troupe. [MBC]\n\n\u201cLee Jung-hyun\u2019s nickname is \u2018Joseon\u2019s Lady Gaga.\u2019 They call me \u2018Tapgol Chungha.\u2019 Isn\u2019t that ingenious?\u201dWhen asked if she knew how viewers referred to her on YouTube, Baek Z Young let out a loud laugh. Baek, now 43, is beginning to win over a generation of young fans thanks to the SBS Kpop Classic YouTube channel, which streams Korean songs from the late 1990s to the early 2000s, including hers, all day long. Baek\u2019s newly-earned nickname pays respect to her place in the K-pop world - it\u2019s a combination of Tapgol, the name of a park frequented by Korean seniors, and Chungha, one of the most popular singers today.\u201cChungha is not only pretty but really flexible and good at expressing things in detail. It\u2019s an honor to have a nickname based on her.\u201dBaek seemed both excited and anxious as she introduced her new EP \u201cReminiscence\u201d to the press ahead of its launch in late September. Although she\u2019s been in the industry for two decades, \u201cReminiscence,\u201d which came out on Friday, was her first new release since 2016, apart from the occasional drama soundtrack appearance. Since getting married to actor Jung Suk-won in 2013 and giving birth to a daughter in 2017, Baek had largely been absent from the charts, only holding concerts or going on TV.\u201cI think I was actually more nervous last year. I wondered then \u2018Is next year really the 20th anniversary of my debut? You\u2019re kidding.\u2019 I wanted to release a full-length album but there wasn\u2019t enough time.\u201cI\u2019ve faced a lot of ups and downs and overcome them, so I wanted to create music that could look back on those memories rather than seek new change. My staff found the perfect word for it, \u2018reminiscence.\u2019 I hope that people can recall not only the memories of the past, but even the places and smells of those times.\u201dBaek had a difficult time deciding the title track for \u201cReminiscence.\u201d She only settled on \u201cWe\u201d after listening to the opinions of the other people she was working with.\u201cAlthough they\u2019re slightly different, in the end, all the songs on the new EP are songs about break-ups. Sometimes you make a lot of good memories until the end rather than separating with heartbreak and sadness. I wanted to express that.\u201dActor Ji Sung appears in the music video for \u201cWe.\u201d It\u2019s his first appearance in a music video since Kim Bum-soo\u2019s \u201cSadness Guide\u201d in 2008.\u201cI wanted an actor around my age who could understand the emotions in my song and cry on cue, so I was really happy when Ji agreed to appear in my video. I went to the set and saw that his eyes were all puffy from crying so much. I was amazed that he could express his emotions like that when there weren\u2019t any clear lines or plot.\u201dAlthough Baek\u2019s hits like \u201cI Won\u2019t Love\u201d (2005) and \u201cLike Being Shot by a Bullet\u201d (2008) are karaoke favorites that many like to belt out when they\u2019re having relationship problems, Baek herself admitted that she\u2019s \u201cnot really a vocalist who draws on my own emotions.\u201d\u201cI like to draw on the emotions of the protagonists of the songs, but I cried a lot when recording the track \u2018Monolog\u2019 for this album. If the girl in the song was my friend, I would\u2019ve hit her back really hard, and told her not to be like that.\u201cThe tone of my voice itself is really minor, so it\u2019s easier for me to express sadness compared to others. I often get asked to play it down a little bit because I sound so desperate.\u201dOver the years, Baek has made music of many different genres. She\u2019s affectionately called the \u201cballad queen,\u201d but her dance duet with 2PM\u2019s Taecyeon \u201cMy Ear\u2019s Candy\u201d (2009) was a huge success when it came out and has since been made into countless parodies. But Baek admits that ballads are the highlights of her 20-year-long career.\u201cI think charting No. 1 with \u2018I Won\u2019t Love\u2019 in 2005 was my happiest moment. It made me feel like I was standing back up, that I could start again. I also got to rethink the meanings of my songs \u2018Like Being Shot by a Bullet\u2019 and \u2018Don\u2019t Forget\u2019 (2009) when I was preparing for the Pyongyang concert last April.\u201d\u201cIf I have the chance I want to challenge myself to make dance music again,\u201d she added. One of the first songs she ever released were Latin-influenced, like \u201cSad Salsa\u201d and \u201cDash\u201d (2000).\u201cI think Latin music will resonate well with Koreans. If I watch my performances from then again I\u2019m using a lot of force from start to end, but I think if I try it now I\u2019ll be able to control my tempo. I wanted another proper go at it so I\u2019ve been giving a lot of references to songwriters, but that might have become a distraction because I still haven\u2019t come across any good songs.\u201dIs there any other realm of music that she wants to be queen of next?\u201cI\u2019m not always happy after receiving a new nickname because that means that I\u2019m also given new responsibilities. I think a singer who becomes part of people\u2019s everyday lives has much more influence.\u201dBaek is about to kick off a nationwide tour titled \u201cBAEK Stage\u201d starting next month in celebration of her 20th debut anniversary. She\u2019ll hold the first concert on Nov. 23 in Suwon, Gyeonggi, and go on to perform in Daegu; Busan; Cheongju, North Chungcheong and Seoul until March.Baek also hinted at holding a concert abroad as well.\u201cI want to meet fans more often through concerts. I\u2019m also planning shows in the Americas for next year.\u201dBY MIN KYUNG-WON [kim.eunjin1@joongang.co.kr]20\uc8fc\ub144 \ub9de\uc740 \ubc31\uc9c0\uc601 \u201c\u2018\ud0d1\uace8 \uccad\ud558\u2019
