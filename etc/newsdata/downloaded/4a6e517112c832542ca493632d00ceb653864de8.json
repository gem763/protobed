How can I still make calls when this happens? There's got to be a way, and I know you know it!\n\nA: Your home is often the worst place to make calls; thick walls, certain building materials, and other electronic devices can easily interfere with your signal. So what do you do? An easy solution is to log onto the nearest Wi-Fi signal. Many smartphone users are unaware that they can harness Wi-Fi to make phone calls, depending on the model of their phone and the carrier they use. This is a great trick, and it's something you might consider anyway, especially if you have a limited plan. But making Wi-Fi calls isn't always an intuitive process, so you should learn precisely how to employ it.

It\u2019s so slow now!\n\nA: Start by deleting apps. I know, I know \u2013 we love our apps. We love our games and camera filters and social media networks. Or maybe you already know that unused apps are taking up space and processing power, but you have so many apps that you don\u2019t even want to bother sifting through them. Understand, a cluttered phone isn\u2019t always the problem; malware and an older operating system can also slow things down. Even the way you treat your battery can affect your phone\u2019s efficiency. Tap or click here to learn more about smartphone maintenance.\n\nSmart TV Spies\n\nQ: Did I hear you, right? My smart TV is also watching and tracking me! How can I make that stop?\n\nA: There is strong evidence that smart TVs can be hacked, and that cyber-criminals can watch every activity in your living room. But there's another kind of spy you should be aware of, tech companies. Thanks to a thing called \"automatic content recognition,\" or ACR, the smart TV will catalog everything you watch and send reports back to manufacturers and data partners. The idea is to create targeted advertising, which is already all over the internet, but most people find this practice very unsettling.

How does it compare to the Amazon Echo Show or Nest Hub?\n\nA: This whole trend started with the Echo Show. Amazon's Echo speakers had exploded in popularity, and the Show was their chance to incorporate a video screen as well. Amazon has refined its design \u2013 and introduced the adorable Echo Spot \u2013 while other developers catch up with the concept. Now there's Nest Hub and, yes, the Facebook Portal. You will have to decide whether it's impressive camera is worth it to you. As you may know, I have become extremely critical of Facebook as a company. I can't promise that the Portal won't collect data on you since privacy is a significant concern. But to keep things fair, you would probably benefit from a side-by-side comparison.
