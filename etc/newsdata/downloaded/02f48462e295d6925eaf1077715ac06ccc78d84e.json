As many as half of China\u2019s pigs, an estimated 300 million, have died of the virus or been exterminated since the disease took hold 13 months ago. In the past months it has advanced to Vietnam, Laos and South Korea. At the beginning of September, the Philippines confirmed African swine fever in at least seven villages near Manila, requiring 7,000 pigs to be euthanized. And at the end of September, East Timor reported more than 100 outbreaks to the World Organization for Animal Health.\n\nWith these developments, the American pork industry has begun mobilizing. Experts say the risk of a domestic outbreak of African swine fever is increasing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a higher probability, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Pyburn said. \u201cWhat are the odds? I don\u2019t have a precise number I can give. But take a look at what this virus is doing around the globe today. And then look at the way goods and people travel. This would have a devastating effect on our industry. It\u2019s the nastiest disease we have on the planet.\u201d\n\nA domestic outbreak could have consequences well beyond the pork industry (which Pyburn said could run into billions of dollars). Widespread loss of pigs could devastate the corn and soy industries, which are primary feed sources, and industries such as beef could be affected by a loss in consumer confidence.\n\nInfected pigs go off their feed, Pyburn said. They don\u2019t want to move and spike a high fever. By Day 5 there is a hemorrhagic disease in the pigs, bleeding throughout the body and in the organs. By the end of the second week, 85 to 95 percent of the pigs die. There is no vaccine or treatment. The virus can live for weeks on infected slaughtered meat or cold cuts, on tainted feed, and on animal feed additives.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile causing high mortality in domesticated and wild pigs, the disease does not infect humans. The only member of the Asfarviridae family, the virus needs to get inside of cells to replicate. According to Pyburn, it requires receptors on host cells and pigs are the only ones with the proper receptors.\n\nBut because there is no vaccine or cure, preventing an outbreak is of paramount importance.\n\nThere is insufficient American organic soy, so hog farmers wishing to feed their animals organic soy often import it from China. And there are feed ingredients \u2014 B vitamins and trace minerals \u2014 that are manufactured only in China. The virus can survive for up to a month on these products, so they must be quarantined and heated to kill the virus.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf it was me, I would ban the importation of soy products from African-swine-fever-infected states,\u201d said Scott Dee, director of research for Pipestone Veterinary Services, who has been studying viral movement in animal feed under a Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research grant. Canada requires a permit for soy products and has a 30-day quarantine period. Dee said a lot of U.S. companies are adopting a similar approach.\n\nAD\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the only risk for an outbreak. Dee said the virus could also be carried by human travelers via the illegal smuggling of meat or other infected food. In many parts of the world, wet markets spread the virus, the kinds of markets where live animals might be at one end of the street, with butchered products for sale at the other. And the practice of feeding pigs \u201cswill\u201d or leftover people food introduces opportunities for tainted meat to be fed to live animals.\n\nThe USDA has outlawed raw swill, as a way of preventing an outbreak of African swine fever, requiring that swill be boiled for 30 minutes and cooled before being fed to pigs, said Timothy Kurt, the scientific program director for Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research.\n\nBut it is difficult for the government to monitor compliance, and because these practices are time-consuming and expensive, experts say some operators could take shortcuts.\n\nAD", "description": "U.S. authorities have started active preparations in response to the rising threat of an outbreak of African swine fever.", "authors": ["Laura Reiley", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Food"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Gz8ex-szvVP7WsSzD22EfBaioTM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WEIVA5XD2QI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
