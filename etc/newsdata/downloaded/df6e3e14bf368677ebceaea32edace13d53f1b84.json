UPDATE 1-Australia's Newcrest greenlights first-stage expansion of Cadia gold mine\n\n* Board approves $685 mln first-stage Cadia mine expansion\n\n* New plan adds 1.8 mln gold oz, 67,000 T over mine life\n\n* Top shareholder sees incremental value\n\n* Estimated capital cost of $865 mln for full expansion\n\n* Second-stage expansion still subject to feasibility study (Recasts and updates with more detail on expansion, shareholder comment)\n\nOct 15 (Reuters) - Australia's Newcrest Mining Ltd , the country's biggest gold producer, said on Tuesday it will go ahead with a $685 million first-stage expansion of its flagship Cadia mine in New South Wales.\n\nNewcrest said board members had approved the initial leg of a two-stage expansion that it expects to boost production from the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe first stage will increase plant capacity to 33 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), Newcrest said. A second stage, still in feasibility, would boost it to to 35 mtpa and improve recoveries for a further $180 million.\n\nThe full expansion plan will add 1.8 million ounces of gold output and 67,000 tonnes of copper over the life of the mine, with an estimated $800 million increase in projected free cash flow, compared to a 2018 study by Newcrest.\n\n\"The capital investment has an estimated 21.5% rate of return and ensures Cadia remains a Tier One asset for many years to come,\" Newcrest Chief Executive Officer Sandeep Biswas said in a statement.\n\nThe projected returns are slightly better than the output Newcrest had predicted in a pre-feasibility study released last year.\n\n\"Incrementally it's positive,\" said Simon Mawhinney, chief investment officer at top shareholder Allan Gray in Sydney, noting a greater than 20% internal rate of return.\n\n\"Given how low their gold price assumption is and arguably their copper price assumption is, it seems like a reasonable initiative and it's slightly better than the previous outcome,\" he said.\n\nNewcrest assumes a gold price of $1,250 and a copper price of $3 a pound ($6,600 a tonne). Gold traded last at $1,492 an ounce. LME copper CMCU3 traded at $5820 a tonne.\n\nNewcrest produced 2.49 million ounces of gold for the financial year ended in June and 105,900 tonnes of copper.\n\n($1 = 1.4760 Australian dollars)", "description": "UPDATE 1-Australia's Newcrest greenlights first-stage expansion of Cadia gold mine", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB5405E_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
