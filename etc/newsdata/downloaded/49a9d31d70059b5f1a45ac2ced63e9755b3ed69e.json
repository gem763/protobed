But his failure to pursue the president\u2019s indictment or to explicitly recommend action by Congress has prompted some impeachment supporters to argue that there are juicier targets for the Judiciary Committee, namely Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to personally profit from the presidency and his potential violation of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause\u2014the prohibition on federal officials receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments.\n\n\u201cThe original sin of this president is converting the presidency into an instrument of self-enrichment,\u201d said Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, an impeachment backer and a former constitutional-law professor on the Judiciary Committee. In an interview, Raskin said that while the possible instances of obstruction of justice laid out in Mueller\u2019s report were \u201cterribly serious,\u201d the allegations of corruption against the president\u2014including his constant promotion of his properties around the world and their repeated patronage by foreign governments, federal agencies, and even the vice president\u2014are \u201ceasily digestible\u201d and \u201ccompelling.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people get that the president is not supposed to be holding office to get rich,\u201d echoed Representative Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania, another Democrat on the committee. \u201cIt is about payoffs, pardons, and profiteering.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Berman", "Theatlantic.Com Politics Archive Democrats-Cant-Decide-Why-Impeach-Donald-Trump"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
