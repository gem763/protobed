Neither the NHS or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acknowledge a single condition called breast implant illness. They do, however, provide long lists of potential \u2013 and publicly known \u2013 side effects of having breast implants. Implants are not designed to last a lifetime, the FDA says, and the longer a woman has the implants in her body the higher the risk of complications occurring. Complications occur in around one per cent of all patients and can happen at any time after the surgery. As well as changes to the appearance and feel of the breast some potential side effects include pain, infection, swelling or irritation, swollen lymph nodes, skin rashes or bruising. Reported symptoms of BII include fatigue, chest pain, hair loss and headaches chills, light sensitivity, chronic pain, anxiety, brain fog, sleep disturbances and depression. The NHS urges any women suffering side effects to contact the clinic where they had the implants put in, and to report it through an official Yellow Card Scheme, to add to information on the safety of implants.

It made me feel top heavy because I'm such a petite woman.\n\n'I was also a bit frustrated because the scars were so prominent from the surgery and they never went away. I thought to myself, what have I done?\n\nMs Luesse had her implants removed in July - exactly three years after they were put in - and said: '[It] was the easiest decision in the world'\n\nMs Luesse said her 'heart dropped' when she realised her implants could be behind her mystery symptoms. She stumbled across a Facebook group with 80,000 women sharing similar tales (pictured before her implants, left, and with them in right)\n\nNow a size 34-B again, the district manager at Arbonne added: 'I couldn't be happier with my breasts (pictured with her implants)\n\n'I had perfect boobs before and I was left with implants and scars, all because I wanted to follow what society viewed as beautiful.'\n\nShe added: 'I noticed the strange symptoms starting around the year-and-a-half mark after getting my implants.'\n\nAs well as her infections, pain and mood swings, Ms Luesse claims she also had a 'chemical taste' in her mouth.\n\nShe said: 'I had a thick white film on my tongue, heavier periods and cramps, sharp excruciating pain in both my breasts, numbness in my hands and arms\n\n'I felt I was getting arthritis. I had an increased urge to urinate, I had mood swings and lower energy, my hair was thinning, and my memory was foggy.\n\n'The worst was the chronic yeast infections because it was every day for months and months.\n\n'It became my new normal. It was awful having to deal with it and so embarrassing, especially in a relationship.'\n\nNow a size 34-B again, the district manager at Arbonne added: 'I couldn't be happier with my breasts.\n\n'The difference in my health now compared to with the implants is like night and day. I feel like myself again, I'm full of energy.'\n\nWhen asked for her advice for fellow women with symptoms, she said: 'To anyone experiencing BII, I would get your implants out immediately.\n\n'What breaks my heart is that there are women who have had them in for years and are suffering with all kinds of chronic symptoms.\n\n'If you're on the fence about getting implants, it's not worth losing your health over. Embrace your beautiful body. Implants are ticking time bombs.\n\n'I know from experience what it feels like going day to day and feeling like something is terribly wrong with you, so it's my commitment to help others now.'\n\nMs Luesse won best breakout actor at the Action on Film International Film Festival in the US in 2010 for her role as Gina Cassidy in Cartel War.", "description": "Sandra Luesse, who lives in California, wanted to look 'perfect' and decided to go from a B-cup to a triple D in 2016.
