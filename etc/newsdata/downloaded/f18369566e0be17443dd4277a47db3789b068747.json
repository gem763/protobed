That\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague,\u201d NBC News said in a statement that was read on air.\n\nLauer said in a letter provided to Fox News by his lawyer that the claims he raped a colleague were false, and the sex consensual.\n\n\"In a new book, it is alleged that an extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter I have previously admitted having, was in fact an assault,\" he wrote. \"It is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense.\"\n\n\u201cToday\u201d co-host Savannah Guthrie was clearly emotional when reporting the latest on Lauer.\n\nMSNBC'S MADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY\n\n\u201cI feel like we owe it to our viewers to pause for a moment, you know, this is shocking and appalling,\u201d Guthrie said. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t even know what to say about it.\u201d\n\nGuthrie then noted that it wasn\u2019t easy for Lauer\u2019s accuser to come forward and she has the full support of \u201cToday\u201d staffers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just very painful for all of us at NBC and who are at the \u2018Today\u2019 show. It\u2019s very, very, very difficult,\u201d Guthrie added.\n\nHoda Kotb then indicated she was having flashbacks to the infamous moment in 2017 when the duo went on air to alert viewers Lauer had been fired for sexual misconduct.\n\nNBC News Chairman Andy Lack, who is a key figure of the Variety report, also issued a statement that was read aloud.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"Our highest priority is to ensure we have a workplace environment where everyone feels safe and protected. We are absolutely committed to making this a reality. There can be no exception,\u201d Lack said.\n\nIn 2018, Lauer issued a statement that denied all alleged wrongdoing, which was re-aired on \u201cToday\u201d on Wednesday in regards to the latest allegation.\n\n\u201cI want to make it perfectly clear that any allegations or reports of coercive, aggressive or abusive behavior actions on my part, at any time, are absolutely false,\u201d Lauer said at the time in the re-broadcast clip.\n\nNBC News did not immediately respond to Fox News\u2019 request for additional comment.\n\nFox News has not seen a copy of the closely guarded book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d which will be released on Oct. 15.", "description": "NBC News\u2019 \u201cToday\u201d reported on its former star Wednesday morning when the flagship morning show covered \u201cshocking and appalling\u201d new allegations against disgraced anchor Matt Lauer.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
