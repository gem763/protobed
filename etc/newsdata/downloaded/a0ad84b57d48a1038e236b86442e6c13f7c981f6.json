When I noted how nimble he looked in some of his dancing scenes in \u201cJoker,\u201d he swatted away the compliment, saying, \u201cI would get injured just from doing a light jog down the street. I\u2019d have to be sent home.\u201d\n\nBut some of that lightness evaporated as soon as I asked how he\u2019d been approached about the film and he replied that he could not remember. \u201cIt sucks \u2014 this is why interviews are the worst,\u201d he said despairingly, adding that he was tempted to make up a story \u201cjust to sound exciting.\u201d\n\nNor was he in any hurry to explain his process for figuring out his \u201cJoker\u201d character before filming began. \u201cIt\u2019s so stupid to talk about,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about it.\u201d (He did eventually talk about it.)\n\nLET\u2019S SET ASIDE PHOENIX for the moment and return to Phillips, who is best known for directing the lucrative \u201cHangover\u201d comedies. At the premiere of his 2016 crime caper, \u201cWar Dogs,\u201d Phillips found himself anticipating its tepid reception while gazing at a billboard for a Marvel superhero juggernaut. He wondered how he could possibly compete.\n\nWarner Bros. had been having only intermittent success with its DC superhero movies \u2014 \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d yes, \u201cSuicide Squad,\u201d no \u2014 but Phillips saw a potential solution to everyone\u2019s problems. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat Marvel \u2014 it\u2019s a giant behemoth,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s do something they can\u2019t do.\u201d", "description": "How did an unpredictable star known for loners and killers wind up in a studio blockbuster based on a comic book?
