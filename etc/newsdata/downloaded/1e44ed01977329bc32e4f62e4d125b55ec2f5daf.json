TikTok recently launched a beta version of their Creator Marketplace, a sort of networking forum that allows brands and prominent creative talents to connect and collaborate on the platform.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nHowever, Chandlee noted, TikTok\u2019s advertising and content decisions are always made with the platform\u2019s \u201clight-hearted and irreverent\u201d ideology in mind. It is in that spirit, he said, that political advertising would not see the light of day on the app.\n\n\u201cAny paid ads that come into the community need to fit the standards for our platform,\u201d Chandlee stated, \u201cand the nature of paid political ads is not something we believe fits the TikTok platform experience.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM", "description": "TikTok announced Thursday that it will not allow paid political ads on its \"light-hearted\" app, frequented by teens.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/social-media-grab.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
