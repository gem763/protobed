In fact, a single 25bps interest rate cut is \u201conly\u201d 95% priced in according to data from Bloomberg, though we would be shocked if the communication-era Fed failed to cut rates after regularly hinting at such a move for weeks.\n\nAs the graphic below shows, inflation ( remains stubbornly below the central bank\u2019s 2.0% target, even while the sits at a half-century low. Meanwhile, the current trade war \u201cceasefire\u201d between the US and China has put one of the global economy\u2019s biggest potential stumbling blocks on hold for the moment:\n\nFOMC Meeting\n\nBeyond the \u201cdecision\u201d about interest rates, recent developments in the money market sector have made this Fed meeting interesting. Over the last week, the interest rate on repos, a key short-term funding mechanism for banks, have surged. In response, the Federal Reserve has reintroduced its own repo facility, essentially injecting money into the banking sector. While most analysts believe the situation is due to a transitory confluence of one-off factors, we expect Chairman Powell to field multiple questions about the repo market in his post-decision press conference. At the margin, these issues may increase the likelihood of a tweak to the IOER, or interest on excess reserves, paid to banks to encourage more lending, or a standing repo facility, which would be viewed as slightly dovish developments.\n\nPotential Market Reaction\n\nWith a 25bps cut widely expected, the decision on interest rates is unlikely to be a big market mover in and of itself. Instead, stock and dollar traders will be keeping a closer eye on the central bank\u2019s outlook for rates and the economy moving forward.\n\nIf Chairman Powell and company cut their forecasts for interest rates (the infamous \u201cdot plot\u201d) and/or inflation for the coming years, traders will view that as a \u201cgreen light\u201d to anticipate more than a \u201cmid-course correction\u201d to interest rates. In that case, we could see the dollar fall and US indices rise.\n\nOn the other hand, a more optimistic outlook that downplays the potential for an economic slowdown would prompt traders to trim their bets on further interest rate cuts from the central bank. In that case, the greenback could catch a bid, while US indices would likely pull back further from their record highs.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Forex Analysis by Matthew Weller covering: .
