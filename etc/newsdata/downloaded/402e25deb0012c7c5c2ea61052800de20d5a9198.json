When this film was first unleashed on the world, everybody was thirsting over that goddamn clown. You couldn't go a single moment without someone whispering 'daddy' in Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd direction, or using the phrase 'down to clown' liberally.\n\nImage: Gizmodo\n\nTo be clear, when you encounter a killer clown, the appropriate response is this:\n\nBill Skarsg\u00e5rd scaring Bill Hader behind the scenes of IT chapter 2 might be the funniest set of photos I\u2019ve ever seen pic.twitter.com/oH5qDbsGDY \u2014 jaz???? (@peterrsmj) September 9, 2019\n\nThe rampant horniness for Pennywise was unending in 2017, and it was everywhere. It tainted my viewing of the film. It infiltrated my friendship circles. It appeared in my dreams. But \u2014 and it gives me all the pleasure in the world to say this \u2014 the clown horniness might finally have come to an end.\n\nPerhaps it was a mixture of Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd weird brooding energy and Cro-Magnon forehead and Pennywise's strange shapeshifting abilities that forced the demonic sexual energies to leak off this film. Maybe young teens all have a closeted clown fetish. Whatever the reason, this ancient demon had fleets of fans begging to ride his tricycle and toot his big horn.\n\nWay Too Many People Want To Bone The Clown From It Far be it from me to kink shame, but I feel like it's probably OK to ask questions when someone wants to bone a murderous supernatural clown.

Peruse at your own risk.\n\nAll I want is for pennywise is to grab me by the neck, lift me up, slam me into the wall and fuck me into oblivion as I barely breathe ???? \u2014 big momma (@katiemelaugh1) September 14, 2017\n\nOkaaayyy, I believe that evidence is enough to suffice. Let's just all settle for the knowledge that once upon a time, people thirsted for the forbidden clown juice, and now the tide has stemmed \u2014 or at least, gone into hiding.\n\nI trawled through several pages of Twitter thoughts and reactions to It Chapter Two and \u2014 to my great surprise \u2014 the Pennywise thirst is becoming a rare beast. In fact, it might just be safe to go back into the murky clown-filled waters now.\n\nMaybe it's because Pennywise is (airquotes) \"cancelled\" now.\n\nIt Chapter Two's Queer Subplot Is Too Subtextual To Be Scary Good It Chapter Two opens with a horrific, homophobic hate crime that Stephen King plucked from the headlines and incorporated into his 1986 novel. After a group of very human bigots attack Adrian Mellon and his boyfriend, they unceremoniously dump Adrian over the side of the bridge, and just as he begins to drown, he sees a figure beckoning him from the shore. A clown. Read more\n\nAfter all, he did actively cause a homophobic hate crime in Derry and murder a gay man in front of his boyfriend \u2014 an act of terror incited directly by his evil juju.\n\nDespite Pennywise's many, many murders and creepy antics in the original film, perhaps it's one violent hate crime that caused the thirst-havers to reconsider the object of their affections. To remind you all, Pennywise is pure evil, and I very much doubt he'd be down for long walks in the woods or some good, hard bonking. His sole purpose is killing and eating, so how he became a sex symbol in the first place is a mystery to me.\n\nTrawling through Twitter, perhaps it would be more apt to say that the thirst never really 'went away', it's just transformed \u2014 but thankfully, the current object of the internet's affection is far more deserving. Instead of thirsting over some festy clown that lives in the sewers, the internet now stans phenomenal actor Bill Hader, famous for his roles in SNL and currently starring in the fantastic HBO series, Barry. (You should all watch Barry, it is very good.)\n\nThis time around the thirst, surprisingly, is pretty tasteful. It's a welcome change.\n\ni think it was a really smart career move for bill hader to rebrand as sexy \u2014 alexa (@playnikes) September 13, 2019\n\ncultural impact: \u2588\n\n\u2588\n\n\u2588\n\n\u2588 \uff3f\n\nbill hader\u2019s the bible\n\nrichie tozier \u2014 chan (@sunnytheon) September 11, 2019\n\nIf young Bill Hader murders me, do NOT prosecute him.
