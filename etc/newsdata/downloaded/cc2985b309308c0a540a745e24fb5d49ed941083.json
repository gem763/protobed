That\u2019s apparently because OnePlus \u201cwants to focus on a single model\u201d in the US, according to a report from Wave7 Research (via PCMag).\n\nThough that\u2019s disappointing if you wanted to buy the OnePlus 7 Pro in the US \u2014 T-Mobile is the carrier partner for OnePlus here \u2014 it seems that T-Mobile is realizing something similar to what my colleague Dan Seifert concluded in his review: most people would be better served buying the 7T, which shares many features with the 7 Pro but offers them at a cheaper price.\n\nT-Mobile confirmed to PCMag that has pulled the 7 Pro from its website \u201cdue to low inventory,\u201d and though apparently you can find it in a \u201climited\u201d number of stores this essentially means that the company is moving on from the phone. We checked T-Mobile\u2019s page for the OnePlus 7 Pro, and it indeed doesn\u2019t offer a way to purchase the phone, instead pointing you a map to find a retail store. That map doesn\u2019t show which stores might be carrying it \u2014 seems you\u2019ll have to check that for yourself.\n\nPCMag also said that OnePlus sales at T-Mobile stores only account for 1.3 percent of all phones, so it seems T-Mobile is moving to focus its efforts on selling just one device, and it will likely have a better sales pitch for the cheaper 7T.\n\nPerhaps the less expensive 7T will fare better at retail\n\nOnePlus built its reputation on making affordable flagships, but they have slowly crept up in price as it and others like Apple and Samsung have added more and more premium features to bring us to the age of the one thousand dollar phone. The OnePlus 7 Pro didn\u2019t cost quite that much at $700, but perhaps the less expensive 7T will fare better at retail when it comes out on October 18th.", "description": "The new OnePlus 7T isn\u2019t even out yet in the US, but T-Mobile has confirmed it\u2019s already pulling its more expensive predecessor, the OnePlus 7 Pro.
