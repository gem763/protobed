We learn of all the eateries who have risen through the culinary ranks to receive one, two or three Michelin stars, and those who have sadly lost them.\n\n187 Michelin-starred UK restaurants have just been announced in the 2020 guide.\n\nGwendal Poullennec, International Director of the Michelin guides, says: \u2018Despite the obvious challenges being faced by the industry here in the UK, we are thrilled that this has been such a stellar year, and we have seen many first ventures opening and rapidly rising to success.\n\nSeeing as though they\u2019re likely to book out before you can say the words \u2018elevated cuisine\u2019 or \u2018degustation\u2019, we\u2019ve put together a shortlist of where you might like to feast next year.\n\nFrom Birmingham to Belfast, from haute cuisine to pub grub, here are some of the restaurants who have just been awarded their first Michelin star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMana, Manchester\n\nMana\u2019s Mangalitza Chawanmushi with their barley miso and native coriander. (Picture: Mana)\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time coming for the Mancs, with Mana bringing the city its first Michelin star since 1977. Yep, the year Elvis died and Star Wars first hit the cinemas.\n\nThe restaurant, which only just opened last October, heralded the end of Manchester\u2019s 41-year dry spell thanks to their Nordic-influenced cuisine.\n\nThe Mana team, fronted by Noma trainee Simon Martin, whips up a mean 16-course tasting spread featuring meals crafted from natural, seasonal ingredients. Highlights include the dessert of pears baked in woodruff with sheep\u2019s yoghurt and the preserved tomato, broad beans and caviar.\n\nM\u00e3os, London\n\nM\u00e3os signature stripped back interior, with their 16-person communal dining table.

After opening its doors 18 months ago, Shoreditch\u2019s M\u00e3os joins 53 other London restaurants who have just been awarded one Michelin star.\n\nThe dinner-party inspired restaurant features one communal table for 16 guests, within a space in a six-story townhouse. If the thought of chatting with strangers frightens you, perhaps the ever-changing European/Asian fusion cuisine might tempt you instead.\n\nIsle Of Eriska Hotel, Scotland\n\nIsle Of Eriska\u2019s chef Graeme Cheevers won a Michelin star the other night. (Picture: Isle Of Eriska)\n\nTwo Scottish restaurants were awarded their first Michelin star in the 2020 guide, one being Isle Of Eriska hotel.\n\nThe restaurant is led by chef Graeme Cheevers, who was previously awarded a Michelin Star at Martin Wishart at Loch Lomond. Cheevers creates culinary gold using locally sourced seafood and vegetables from the property garden.\n\nIsle of Eriska is situated on a private island accessible by bridge. (Picture: Isle of Eriska)\n\nThe hotel is obviously more than just the food. The scenic venue is situated just north of Oban, on a private island accessible by bridge. It also features views over the stunning Loch Creran and Isle of Lismore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeach House, Wales\n\nBeach House\u2019s delicious dark chocolate orange and gingerbread ice cream.

(Picture: Muddler\u2019s Club)\n\nMuddler\u2019s Club has become the third Northern Ireland eatery to earn a Michelin star this year. Tucked away in Belfast\u2019s Cathedral Quarter, this industrial-style venue serves up flavoursome burrata, miso beef and parmesan scallop.\n\nThey\u2019re also a favourite when it comes to hospitality, being named the restaurant with \u2018best customer service\u2019 at the Irish Restaurant Awards a few months ago.\n\nThe Angel at Hetton, Yorkshire\n\nThe rocky-road looking Hetton Game Terrine at The Angel in Yorkshire.

Hearing you drool for dessert. The Angel plates up confit blackberries with olive oil cake and jam as well as a hazelnut parfait with toasted hazelnut cake and yoghurt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpheem, Birmingham\n\nOpheem in Birmingham offers progressive Indian dining. (Picture: Opheem)\n\nIndian fine dining venue Opheem earns the city its fifth star thanks to its creative modern menu. The popular Birmingham restaurant is fronted by chef Aktar Islam, who is no stranger to culinary victory. Back in 2009, he was crowned the winner of Gordon Ramsay\u2019s F-Word.\n\nMORE: Caf\u00e9 owner defends asking breastfeeding new mum to \u2018cover up\u2019\n\nMORE: An iconic rainbow 90s brand just threw up all over this hotel suite\n\nMORE: Can\u2019t remove your fake tan?
