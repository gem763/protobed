Whole Foods said it is helping workers explore full-time jobs at its stores or find other ways to get health coverage.\n\nThe move was roundly condemned by labor advocates, some of whom said that health cuts essentially undo the higher minimum wage of $15 an hour that Amazon announced last year.\n\n\"Amazon's plan to cut health care for these part-time employees is one of Jeff Bezos' most brazen attacks on the quality of jobs at Whole Foods and the communities they support,\" Mark Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said in a statement.\n\nOnline shopping giant Amazon, whose biggest individual shareholder is billionaire founder Jeff Bezos, bought Whole Foods two years ago for nearly $14 billion, cutting prices on some items and adding its smile logo in its aisles as well as expanding delivery services for customers.", "description": "The high-end grocery chain, owned by Amazon, will cut health insurance for about 1,900 workers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/13/0094bc04-dd06-4c07-b5de-e788fc00d8b0/thumbnail/1200x630/9341ef06bbb9df367be82cd90c873061/whole-foods-gettyimages-488633875.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
