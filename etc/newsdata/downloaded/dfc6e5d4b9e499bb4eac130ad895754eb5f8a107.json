Meaning that because employers have to pay more in salaries, they aren\u2019t hiring, or are even firing workers.\n\nMy response to that?\n\nPlease.\n\nIn fact, what we\u2019ve seen lately in the job market should finally put that old canard \u2014 higher pay leads to job losses \u2014 to rest.\n\nFact One: The effective minimum wage (I\u2019ll spell this out below) has been soaring recently and is at an all-time high.\n\nFact Two: At 3.5%, the U.S. unemployment rate hasn\u2019t been this low since December 1969, almost exactly half a century ago. Nixon was in the White House, Neil Armstrong was on the moon, and the hippies were at Woodstock. A long time ago.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it, case closed, except for another fact. That is, I think employers, business owners, and CEOs sometimes use higher wages, particularly those mandated by the government (i.e. minimum wage hikes), as an excuse or cover for weak performance by their businesses \u2014 and/or for other reasons.\n\nFurther, if you see a business predicated on paying workers the current federal minimum wage of $7.25, you have to ask yourself what kind of a life is that company providing for its employees.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you what kind of life.\n\nThat $7.25 an hour works out to be $15,080 a year. Federal guidelines mandate that a salary of $21,330 or below for a family of three is at poverty level and is eligible for certain federal programs including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps. (Ok, sure, for an individual the poverty level is a salary of $12,490. Still.)\n\nI\u2019m not saying that pay hikes aren\u2019t real money for an employer, particularly for a small business owner with a few employees. But the federal minimum wage hasn\u2019t been raised since July 2009. If you haven\u2019t factored in giving your workers a raise in, what, 123 months, I would submit you aren\u2019t so hot in the planning department.\n\nOr you\u2019re taking advantage.\n\nCredit: David Foster/Yahoo Finance More\n\nSo if the federal minimum wage is $7.25, what do I mean by the effective minimum wage and why has that been climbing? First, understand that the federal minimum wage is binding only in 21 states, mostly in southern and western states. The other 29, have state minimum wages, all higher than the federal bar, and now some cities like New York City and Seattle are raising the bar, as well.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, if you average all these minimums across the country, you get an effective national minimum wage of $11.80. That\u2019s the number that I said has soared over the past decade \u2014 just as the unemployment rate was plummeting \u2014 and is at an all-time high.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s tough to make the case that the states with the low, federal minimum wage threshold have better economies.\n\nAnd yet, businesses still complain. New York City raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour in December and there was predictable howling, with some restaurant owners complaining they had to shut their steak house or Mexican restaurant because of higher wages (even though there are thousands of similar, thriving places). In any event, these are in fact real costs and it\u2019s a hot button issue \u2014 I understand that. But get beyond the emotion and look at the numbers and you see another picture.\n\nYannet Lathrop, a researcher with the National Employment Law Project, co-authored a report on NYC restaurants showing that after five years of minimum wage increases, New York City\u2019s restaurant industry is thriving. \u201cPeople do feel passionately about the minimum wage increase,\u201d says Lathrop. \u201c[But the] overwhelming body of evidence suggests minimum wages do what [they\u2019re] supposed to do: increase wages for workers affected and no distinguishable effects on employment. You can go by what you feel about minimum wage personally, or by what data says.\u201d", "description": "The effective minimum wage in America has slowly been growing \u2014 and it's clear it's not hurting job growth.", "authors": ["Andy Serwer With Max Zahn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oSUApiNwDWxjmb8VN0v9cg--~B/aD0zMTc1O3c9NDc2MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/50e1ea00-f1dd-11e9-bfbb-60b1c72ddf30", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
