He called Warren \u201cridiculous\u201d in her refusal to spell out how she\u2019d pay for the $30 trillion Medicare for All program and suggested she is a foreign-policy novice for calling for the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from the Middle East.\n\nHe is leaning heavily into appearing presidential. His events are designed more for the Rose Garden than for an Iowa community center, with a schedule heavy on formal speeches targeting President Donald Trump and fundraisers on the coasts. His remarks include frequent mentions of former President Barack Obama and hours spent in the White House Situation Room.\n\nAnd he refuses to acknowledge that, by some markers, Warren has caught up or passed him in the Democratic race, something that the other candidates made clear by singling her out for attacks during Tuesday\u2019s debate in Westerville, Ohio, and on the campaign trail since then.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any polling showing that nationally on average that anybody else is a front-runner,\u201d he told reporters this week despite a number of polls showing just that.\n\nIn all, Biden\u2019s approach to Warren\u2019s climb has been to intensify his efforts to look and sound like a statesman, resisting any forces that might suggest he won\u2019t be facing Trump in the general election. At the same time, Trump has given him plenty of fodder, from his accusations of corruption by the Biden family to his abrupt withdrawal of troops from Syria, which speaks to Biden\u2019s foreign policy expertise.\n\nBut even as Biden projected indifference about Warren\u2019s gains, he\u2019s also shown signs of feeling the heat as he tries to chip away at her \u201cI have a plan\u201d candidacy and to suggest as he did during the debate that Warren isn\u2019t being \u201cstraightforward\u201d on a range of issues, including taxes and fundraising.\n\nAs Warren was quietly rising in the polls through the summer, Biden\u2019s attacks on Medicare for All were aimed at Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris while leaving out Warren, who studiously kept her distance.\n\nHis tactics shifted this week. He has repeatedly attacked her for her refusal to explain how she\u2019d pay for Medicare for All, a plan she adopted from Sanders, calling her explanations \u201cvague\u201d and not \u201cstraightforward.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to pick on Elizabeth Warren but this is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous,\u201d he said after the debate.\n\nBiden is also highlighting his foreign policy credentials. He spent decades on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, rising to chairman, a position that helped him become Obama\u2019s running mate.\n\nHe jabbed Warren, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee but has little other foreign policy experience, for her call to withdraw all American armed forces from the Middle East.\n\n\u201cI have never heard anyone say, with any serious background in foreign policy, that we pull all troops out of the Middle East,\u201d Biden said Wednesday. Although the foreign policy speech he gave later that day in Iowa was targeted at Trump, it was also a signal to voters that Warren has spent her career on financial issues and can\u2019t claim the same kind of extensive foreign policy experience that he possesses.\n\nAnd on Friday, he took a swipe at Warren again, announcing endorsements from 51 political leaders in her home state of Massachusetts.\n\nHis Iowa speech was the third in a recent wave focused on Trump. Last week in New Hampshire, he delivered a formal address calling for the president\u2019s impeachment and the week before in Reno, Nevada, he stood up to Trump\u2019s discredited claims that his son Hunter\u2019s work in Ukraine was corrupt.\n\nAll three speeches drew praise from pundits and a bit more national media attention than his typical campaign stops. Yet while he met voters after each speech, his recent trips to early-voting states have been light on the local issues and retail politics that some voters in those places expect.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Joe Biden isn\u2019t giving up his front-runner mantle without a fight, refusing to acknowledge that Elizabeth Warren has met him at the top of the 2020 Democratic field and moving to take her on directly on the campaign trail.Her rise -- she now meets or surpasses him in key state and national", "authors": ["Jennifer Epstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
