Kai Kahele (D), who thanked the congresswoman for her service in a statement while saying that her presidential bid had left her district \u201cwithout a voice in Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince announcing her Presidential candidacy in January 2019, Congresswoman Gabbard has worked hard visiting towns and cities across the United States,\u201d Kahele said in a statement shortly after Gabbard's announcement. \u201cThis dedication, while worthy of admiration, meant that her congressional district was often left without a voice in Washington, D.C. I wholly respect and appreciate the Congresswoman\u2019s decision not to seek re-election to the U.S. House of Representatives as she pursues the Presidency. I thank her for her service, and I wish her and her family the best going forward.\u201d\n\nGabbard has struggled to gain ground in the crowded 2020 Democratic field. In a RealClearPolitics average of polls, she is currently in 10th place with 1.3 percent support.\n\nShe has not yet reached the Democratic National Committee qualification thresholds for the debate in November. She has met the threshold in one of four qualifying polls she would need to be on the stage.\n\nIn recent weeks, Gabbard has made headlines for feuding with Clinton.\n\nThe former secretary of State appeared to suggest last week that Gabbard was a \"Russian asset\" and was being groomed for a third-party run. The congresswoman has in turn called Clinton the \"queen of warmongers.\"\n\nUpdated at 8:08 a.m.", "description": "Rep.
