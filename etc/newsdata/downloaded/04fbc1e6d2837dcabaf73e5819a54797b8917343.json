It depends a lot on where you live.\n\nRecent graduates in entry-level jobs will make an average of $51,347 annually in 2019, according to recruiting firm Korn Ferry. The Wall Street Journal interviewed five millennial workers in five different cities about what it\u2019s like to live on roughly $50,000 a year. They told us about their living expenses, how much they save and what they do on Friday nights.\n\nHere are their stories, edited and condensed from recent interviews.\n\nLeslie Paez outside her Houston apartment. Photo: Callaghan O'Hare for The Wall Street Journal\n\nLeslie Paez, Houston\n\nAge: 25\n\nSalary: $45,000\n\nOccupation: Payroll and HR administrator, Double Oak Storm Tex\n\nRent: $683.50, splitting a $1,367 two-bedroom townhome with her fianc\u00e9\n\nHow do you get to work?\n\nYou can\u2019t really get to a lot of places without a car here in Houston. The only time we use Uber is if we\u2019re going somewhere at night or on the weekends. I pay $375 a month for the car [not including insurance]. My job is kind of far away, so I fill up [the tank] once a week.\n\nWhat are your typical Friday night or weekend plans?\n\nWe have a lot of bars near downtown or midtown that have games you can play outside like cornhole or pool tables.\n\nNormally if we decide to Uber [if we\u2019re going out with friends], it might be anywhere from $13 to $25 to get there. We might go to dinner. I\u2019ll have maybe one or two drinks, and that\u2019s pretty much it. Altogether, we normally spend around $100.\n\nWe used to do that like twice a month but now that we\u2019re getting married soon it hasn\u2019t been often because we have so much going on. We had 320 guests invited, we got it down to 280. We\u2019re probably spending roughly $35,000.\n\nAre you able to save?\n\nNo, everything I would save goes basically to the wedding right now.\n\nMore on her life in Houston here.\n\nNatalie Blockhus on the balcony of the apartment she shares with a roommate in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Louis Park.

I have a metro pass through my job that I pay for out of my paycheck and it\u2019s about $60 a month for unlimited rides.\n\nI do have a car, and I try and pay my insurance semiannually instead of doing it monthly. I pay around $450 twice a year. That way I can deplete my savings at once and not have to worry about it.\n\nWhat are your typical Friday night or weekend plans?\n\nThere\u2019s this bar called Cowboy Jack\u2019s downtown that we go to sometimes, or if we go to Uptown, Stella\u2019s Fish Cafe turns into a little bar scene at night.\n\nWe try and pregame at home as much as possible, so once we\u2019re out we don\u2019t have to buy as many drinks. We\u2019ll all split an Uber to a bar, which ends up being $3 to $4 a person. It depends how rowdy we\u2019re being that specific night, but we probably spend $30-ish on average. Typically I stick with a vodka lemonade\u2014I\u2019m not ordering Grey Goose or anything like that.\n\nAre you able to save?\n\nI\u2019m not in a relationship and I don\u2019t have any kids or pets, so I\u2019m trying to keep my 401(k) [contribution] as high as possible. It\u2019s at 10%, so I\u2019m seeing less of my salary than a lot of other people are. I also try to put $200 monthly into a savings account.\n\nBeing in the finance field, I do have a financial adviser who helps me coordinate what I should be doing.\n\nI also do save up for some fun girl trips. I\u2019m going to visit my friend who lives in North Carolina in October. My friend and I are splitting a checked bag, so we can save on that.\n\nMore on her life in Minneapolis here.\n\nInvestment adviser David Dick at his office in Oklahoma City.

I have a brand new vehicle and she has an older vehicle.\n\nWhat are your typical Friday night or weekend plans?\n\nI like to go to Topgolf. It\u2019s a place where we can go hit golf balls, have a few drinks and order dinner there. If you\u2019re doing that, you\u2019re gonna spend around $100 or more. If only drinks, maybe $30 or $40.\n\nThere\u2019s a ShowBiz [Cinemas] in Edmond that has bowling and a $5 movie night on Tuesday. I\u2019m a big \u201cLion King\u201d fan, that\u2019s my favorite childhood movie ever. It\u2019s maybe $30-$40 for popcorn and tickets and everything altogether.\n\nWe tend to cook in a lot and save money doing it that way. In four years together, we\u2019ve never been on a vacation. We\u2019ve thought about it every year but then we always ask ourselves, \u201cWhat could we make this money do for us that\u2019s not gonna be gone in three days?\u201d\n\nBeing in Oklahoma, we are big-time hunters. We tend to hunt a lot during the fall and winter. The deer we do harvest, we eat and we haven\u2019t really bought red meat in the store since last November.\n\nAre you able to save?\n\nI\u2019m not on a fixed salary. Being an independent financial adviser, I have to plan for my own taxes. I also have to plan for my errors-and-omissions insurance that I have to pay at the end of the year to keep my license.\n\nI put 30% or 40% into a savings account. I\u2019m a big-time saver. I max out my Roth IRA, so that\u2019s $500 a month.\n\nMore on his life in Oklahoma City here\n\nPatrick Komorous puts 15% of his salary in a 401(k) and pays for his M.B.A. classes in Charlotte, N.C., with student loans. Photo: Andy McMillan for The Wall Street Journal\n\nPatrick Komorous, Charlotte, N.C.\n\nAge: 26\n\nSalary: $48,000 (plus commission)\n\nOccupation: Utility sales representative, Sealed Air\n\nRent: $1,400 for a one-bedroom apartment.\n\nHow do you get to work?\n\nI live about 10 to 15 minutes away. Even in really bad traffic, the worst case is like 30 minutes.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t cost anything to park where I live. I go to Wake Forest University at Charlotte campus for my M.B.A. Whenever I go to class downtown, I\u2019ll normally just park at my apartment and walk.\n\nWhat are your typical Friday night or weekend plans?\n\nIf we\u2019re going out on a Saturday afternoon, there are a lot of places to grab a beer that\u2019s been locally brewed and eat at a food truck. I typically spend between $50 and $100.\n\nThe minor-league [baseball] games are a really fun time. They have games throughout the spring and summer that are $10, $15 for a ticket. Then you buy a beer or two, and you can have a lot of fun for $30.\n\nWhat are you saving for?\n\nThe biggest thing for me is retirement. I pay for school with student loans, but I put about 15% of my money into my 401(k) each month, mostly because the company will match about 5%. I try to put about $200 a week into a savings account, for a rainy day more than anything else.\n\nI want to buy a new truck soon. I\u2019m driving the same truck I\u2019ve had for 10 years, so I don\u2019t have a payment every month and the insurance is cheap.\n\nI got really close to buying a condo in the spring, but I wanted to put 20% down, and at that point I had maybe 15%.\n\nI have a real serious sit down probably once every few months where I type out all of my expenses and use an Excel sheet to budget it out. But then you get a little distracted or life moves a little too quickly and you get off track.\n\nMore on his life in Charlotte here\n\nRebecca Determan on the porch of her Tucson home with her dog, Luna. Photo: Cassidy Araiza for The Wall Street Journal\n\nRebecca Determan, Tucson, Ariz.\n\nAge: 27\n\nSalary: $45,000\n\nOccupation: Project specialist, University of Arizona Alumni Association\n\nRent: $800, including home-owner-association fees, for a two-bedroom condo\n\nHow do you get to work?\n\nI live about three to five miles from campus, so it\u2019s about a 10-minute drive for me. Once students are back, it can take up to 20 minutes. The price to park on campus is $726 for the year.\n\nI do have the luxury of getting to go home for lunch, I see my dog, Luna, a 10-year-old Yorkie, get her a quick walk.\n\nHow does Luna factor into your budget?\n\nShe\u2019s an older dog, so I knew that I had to get pet insurance. With that, her food and some toys, I budget about $50 to $60 a month.\n\nWhat are your typical Friday night or weekend plans?\n\nI love to eat out, which is where all my money goes. I really enjoy a restaurant called Seis Kitchen. Typically, I\u2019d go to a happy hour for a night out, and a more expensive drink is anywhere from $8 to $10.\n\nAre you able to save?\n\nIt\u2019s super tight. I have a goal number that I try to save every month; that sometimes doesn\u2019t happen. I put away money into my retirement and [my employers] do a match. But if you were to ask, \u201cWhat does your savings account look like,\u201d that is not a pretty sight.\n\nI used my savings to pay for my master\u2019s degree, so I\u2019m just trying to rebuild my savings right now.\n\nMore on her life in Tucson here\n\nWrite to Francesca Fontana at francesca.fontana@wsj.com", "description": "Recent graduates in entry-level jobs make an average of $51,347 annually.
