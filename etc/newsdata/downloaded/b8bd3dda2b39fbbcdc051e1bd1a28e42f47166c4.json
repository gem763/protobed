And soon that noblest of human qualities will be available in emoji form, following a global effort to find the most appropriate icon.\n\nA coalition of charitable and peace-building organisations in Finland are leading the quest to crowdsource an emoji to be added to the thousands available to smartphone users.\n\nIdeas for the emoji mooted on the campaign\u2019s Instagram include a vine of leaves cast across a love heart, two people from different ethnicities clasping hands in front of a heart, and a love heart with a plaster placed upon it.\n\n\u201cIn our modern digital communication culture, emojis are an essential way of expressing human feelings beyond words,\u201d says Tuomo Pesonen, from the Evangelical Lutheran church of Finland, which came up with the idea and is one of the founding organisations of the #forgivemoji campaign.\n\nThe house painted with 'spiteful' smileys, and other emoji rows Read more\n\n\u201cWe were surprised to realise that the official emoji selection has dozens of different cats and even two designs of zombies, but there isn\u2019t an emoji for forgiveness.\u201d\n\nHe explained how the campaign will strive to promote a message of peace and mutual understanding across the world and that it was hoped a future emoji would help encourage people to carry forgiveness into their every day communications.\n\nCampaigners will urge managers of the emoji list at the Unicode Consortium to add the winning idea to the collection, which is used by millions of smart phone users across the world.\n\nThere are thousands of emojis, from yawning faces, to falafels, mischievous sloths and prosthetic limbs, and of course the ubiquitous smiling turd. A new \u201cdrop of blood\u201d icon was also introduced this year following a campaign by Plan International UK, a girls\u2019 rights charity to introduce a period-themed emoji.\n\nBut of all the weird, wonderful and miscellaneous icons, none appear to equate to saying sorry.\n\nAntti Pentik\u00e4inen from the Deaconess Foundation, a non-profit organisation helping disadvantaged people, said reconciliation was key to sustaining peace.\n\n\u201cWithout it, conflicts continue in cycles and get worse,\u201d she said. \u201cWe urgently need to learn better how to reconcile. These skills are needed everywhere. Different ways to encourage apologising and forgiveness are an essential part of it, and this includes the social media environment.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.
