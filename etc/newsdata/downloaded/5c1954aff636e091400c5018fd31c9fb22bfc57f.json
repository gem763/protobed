After listening to the cardinals\u2019 concerns, Pope Francis said he would assemble a commission to consider both issues.\n\n\u201cI am going to take up the challenge that \u2026 you have put forward, that women be heard,\u201d Francis said.\n\nThe cardinals said Jesus entrusted women in the ministry, setting an example for the church today.\n\nThe Oct. 6-27 meeting in Vatican City also focused on serious threats facing the Amazon Basin, including the outbreak of wildfires in the rain forest this year. They want to define ecological sin and called for the churches across the region to move away from industries that hurt the environment.\n\nAll 120 paragraphs of the document were adopted by the assembly with the required two-thirds: 120 members of the 181 present for the voting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sin against future generations and manifests itself in acts and habits of pollution and destruction of the environmental harmony, transgressions against the principles of interdependence and the breaking of solidarity networks among creatures and against the virtue of justice,\u201d the Cardinals said.\n\nCardinal Carlos Aguiar Retes, the archbishop of Mexico City, warned of dire consequences for the region if nothing is done.\n\n\u201cOur common home is at risk; the situation is urgent,\u201d Retes said. \u201cIf global warming goes much beyond two degrees, there will be [the risk of] catastrophe in the oceans.\u201d\n\nHe added that there\u2019s a risk of \u201cdesertification\u201d caused by global warming where lakes and rivers dry up.\n\nHe added that there is strong resistance to these changes from those who have money and power.\n\n\u201cThe real problem is that those who have the money impose the rules; this has happened down the centuries,\u201d Retes said. \u201cBut the government should regulate for the safeguarding of the environment against those economic interests. As church we cannot do it, but we can raise awareness. I think that is the task of the church: to awaken consciences.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 26 (UPI) \u2014 The Catholic Church could allow married priests while also ordaining women as deacons on a regional basis, based on recommendations", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
