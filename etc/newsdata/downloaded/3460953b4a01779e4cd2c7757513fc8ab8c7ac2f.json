Despite all the noise, what must not be forgotten is the importance of getting the UK economy back on track,\" said CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith.\n\nClosely-watched business surveys from IHS Markit covering the performance of the manufacturing, construction and services sectors in September are due on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.", "description": "Brexit crisis pushes UK business expectations to weakest since 2011: CBI", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8R0UQ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
