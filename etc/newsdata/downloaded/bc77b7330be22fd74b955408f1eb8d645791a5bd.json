A Goldman Sachs look at data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found growth for the bottom half of earners at its highest rate of the cycle. And even among that bottom half, the biggest gains are going to workers earning the least. A New York Times analysis of data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found that wage growth among the lowest 25 percent of earners had exceeded the growth in every other quartile.\n\nIn fact, according to Bunker\u2019s research, wages for low-income workers may be growing at their highest rate in 20 years.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening here? Donald Trump hasn\u2019t sprinkled MAGA pixie dust over the U.S. economy. In fact, his trade war has clearly diminished employment growth in industries, that are sensitive to foreign markets, such as manufacturing. Rather, a tight labor market and state-by-state minimum wage hikes have combined to push up wage growth for the poorest workers. The sluggishness of overall wage growth is concealing the fact that the labor market has done wonderful things for wages at the low end.", "description": "", "authors": ["Derek Thompson", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Labor-Departments-New-Report-Isnt-So-Gloomy"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
