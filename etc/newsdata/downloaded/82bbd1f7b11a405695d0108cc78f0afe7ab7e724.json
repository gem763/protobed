Warren at first stumbled by suggesting she did not approve of the idea of a vice president allowing to serve on the board of a foreign company.\n\n\u201cNo. \u2026 I don\u2019t know. I mean, I\u2019d have to go back and look at the details,\u201d she replied.\n\nSince then, Warren dodged media attempts to answer questions about Biden and his son, pivoting back to accuse Trump of trying to dodge his own misconduct in Ukraine.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders has also dodged the question, demanding \u201cevidence\u201d of any impropriety by the Bidens.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m a little bit old-fashioned. I like to see the evidence before I talk about things. I read the papers and I read what I read,\u201d Sanders said last week. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know that I know enough at this point to make any definitive statement.\u201d\n\nSen. Kamala Harris has also defended Biden, pointing instead at Trump.\n\n\u201cMr. President, telling lies about Joe Biden won\u2019t protect you from the truth. Joe has more patriotism in his pinky finger than you\u2019ll ever have,\u201d Harris wrote on Twitter.\n\nHarris scored an early hit on Biden by questioning his history of opposing public bussing in public schools, even earning a bump in the polls, but the early momentum soon faded.\n\nAttacking Biden has not worked well for other candidates as well. Former Housing Secretary Julian Castro swung at Biden, questioning memory loss in the last debate, but missed, earning scorn from pundits and Democrat voters.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand tried to score points against Biden on women\u2019s issues, but her attack came off as self-serving, leading her to ultimately drop out of the race.\n\nOther low-polling candidates who tried to score points against Joe Biden, such as New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio and Rep. Eric Swalwell, soon dropped out of the race after their attacks failed to resonate with primary voters.\n\nCastro did not appear interested in hitting the Bidens again, responding to questions about Hunter Biden by criticizing Trump.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is trying to use the same playbook against Joe Biden as he used against Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said.\n\nMayor Pete Buttigeig began the week by vocally defending Biden on CNN, earning praise from the former Vice President.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a friend of Pete Buttigieg,\u201d Biden told the United Food and Commercial Workers 2020 presidential forum on Sunday. \u201cBy the way, he\u2019s a really decent guy. I turned on the television this morning and he was defending me and my family against these outrageous, lying ads of the president of the United States of America. That\u2019s a good man.\u201d\n\nSen. Cory Booker, who at times cannot resist taking gratuitous shots at Biden, has also stood up for the president.\n\n\u201cThis is unacceptable, that if you come after Joe Biden, you\u2019re going to have to deal with me in this case, these are baseless, unfounded, scurrilous lies,\u201d he said in October.\n\nBut in September, Booker also questioned Hunter Biden\u2019s actions when Trump\u2019s attacks took form.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think children of vice presidents, presidents during the administration should be out there doing that,\u201d he said.\n\nOther candidates have promised not to allow similar behavior if they were elected president.\n\n\u201cI would not allow a family member, anyone in my cabinet to have a family member, to work in a position like that,\u201d Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke said\n\nSen. Amy Klobachar promised the same.\n\n\u201cI can promise you right now, my own daughter, who\u2019s only 24, does not sit on the board of a foreign company,\u201d she said on CNN.\n\nAndrew Yang said Hunter Biden\u2019s role in foreign companies \u201ccertainly has a bad look to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my mind they can wait until the term is over before serving that term,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really the way it would be under my administration.\u201d\n\nTulsi Gabbard remains the wildcard.\n\nAfter a devastating series of attacks against Sen. Kamala Harris in the August debate, Gabbard demonstrated she knew how to criticize the substance of her opponent\u2019s record, without sounding gratuitous.\n\nWhen asked to weigh in on the Biden\u2019s she said that allowing a vice president\u2019s son to sit on a corporate board \u201cwould be a poor decision to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what went into that or how he got hired or why or what influence there was used, if any, but I think the perception is certainly a concern,\u201d she said.", "description": "Democrat 2020 candidates for president face a tough decision in the primary debate, as former Joe Biden faces additional scrutiny.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Biden-Record-Players-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
