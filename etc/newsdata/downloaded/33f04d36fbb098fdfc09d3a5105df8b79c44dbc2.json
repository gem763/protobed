A \u2018C\u2019 means a team is in similar standing, with notches up or down from there\n\nCan Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons coexist?\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWhile I\u2019ve wondered about that question, the 76ers have charged ahead with the pairing. Embiid and Simmons are the givens. The surrounding players change. In just two seasons, J.J. Redick, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Markelle Fultz, Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris have cycled through as starters.\n\nThe latest supporting starters: Harris, Al Horford and Josh Richardson.\n\nThis might be the last chance to find a trio that works.\n\nPhiladelphia has taken advantage of Embiid\u2019s and Simmons\u2019 low rookie-scale salaries, which was always a selling point of The Process. A roster loaded with cheap young players created a window to add more-expensive talent. Then, with everyone already in place, NBA rules generally allow teams to keep their own players.\n\nBut Embiid is already on his max contract extension, and Simmons just signed a max contract extension that will take effect next year. The flexibility is vanishing.\n\nOne last time, the 76ers made the most of it. They signed-and-traded Butler for Richardson and let Redick walk in free agency. That left enough cap space to sign Al Horford (four years, $109 million with $97 million guaranteed) and use Bird Rights to re-sign Tobias Harris (five years, $180 million).\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of deliberate disruption for a team that was already good and rising.\n\nThe big question: Did it make Philadelphia better?\n\nI just don\u2019t know.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs fond as I am of Butler, I understand all the reasons to be wary of offering the 30-year-old a huge contract. But moving on from him to give a huge deal to a 33-year-old Horford? That\u2019s curious. Then again, Philadelphia also added Richardson \u2013 a solid replacement for Butler on the wing \u2013 in the process.\n\nThe 76ers will miss Butler\u2019s shot creation. He often took over their offense in the clutch during the playoffs. Harris can pick up some of the slack, but that still looks like a hole.\n\nAt just 27, Harris is young for a player who has already been in the league so long. That\u2019s a big reason it was worth Philadelphia signing him to a sizable long-term contract.\n\nHorford\u2019s deal could age poorly, but he\u2019s a winner still playing quality all-around basketball. If nothing else, the 76ers removed Embiid\u2019s best defender from the rival Celtics.\n\nPhiladelphia filled its bench with several value signings \u2013 Mike Scott (room exception), James Ennis (minimum), Kyle O'Quinn (minimum), Furkan Korkmaz (minimum), Raul Neto (minimum) and Trey Burke (partially guaranteed minimum). However, sometimes teams need production more than cost-effectiveness. The 76ers\u2019 bench struggled last season, and they devoted minimal resources to upgrading.\n\nIn the draft, Philadelphia traded the Nos. 24 and 33 picks for No. 20 pick Matisse Thybulle. That\u2019s a costly move up, especially for a player I rated No. 34. Worse, it seemingly happened because Boston snuffed out the 76ers\u2019 interest in Thybulle then leveraged them. That\u2019s small potatoes, though.\n\nSimmons (No. 9 on our list of the 50 best players in 5 years) and Embiid (No. 11 on our list of the 50 best players in 5 years) will likely define this era for Philadelphia. Embiid is on his way to becoming one of the NBA\u2019s very best players. Simmons is so good, giving him a max extension was a no-brainer.\n\nBut they were already in place.\n\nHarris, Horford and Richardson will define this offseason. I just can\u2019t tell whether they made the 76ers\u2019 promising future even brighter or slightly dimmer.\n\nOffseason grade: C", "description": "Grading the Philadelphia 76ers' offseason.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.Y6W2cuSq6zNKYEWtUPxUw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTkyMDtoPTUxNg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pJlkOARNDdVDZD3UxyUPyg--~B/aD0yNTg7dz00NjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/04316de83385c295b542689410d4c1b3", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
