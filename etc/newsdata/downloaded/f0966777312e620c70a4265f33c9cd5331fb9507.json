Suzanne Collins\u2019s fourth Hunger Games book, a prequel about the rise of Panem, officially has a title and a book cover. It was formally unveiled on Good Morning America Friday. Titled The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, the cover features a gilded mockingjay perched on spindly branches above a winding snake, in that signature Hunger Games metal-pin style. It\u2019s only a matter of time before Hot Topic stores are covered in this graphic. The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is set 64 years before the events of Hunger Games, in the \u201cDark Days,\u201d a period ten years after the war, but before Panem has reached its height. It will \u201cexplore the state of nature, who we are, and what we perceive is required for our survival,\u201d Collins said in a statement announcing the new Scholastic book earlier this year. The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes arrives in May 2020, at which point Jennifer Lawrence may or may not be Jennifer Maroney? The passage of time is chilling.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: We just revealed the cover and title of the brand new @Scholastic \"Hunger Games\" book - \"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\"! https://t.co/LUKfafEEKb pic.twitter.com/Gr3ZrRoFMu \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) October 4, 2019", "description": "The lastest installment in Suzanne Collins\u2019s \u2018Hunger Games\u2019 series has officially got a title and book cover.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/04/04-the-hunger-games.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
