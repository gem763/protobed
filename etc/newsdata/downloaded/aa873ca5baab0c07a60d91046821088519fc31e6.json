The video is clear, he did. We stand by our statement.\u201d\n\nLate on Wednesday, Ms Sanders posted partial video footage of the incident, alongside a statement which read: \u201cWe stand by our decision to revoke this individual\u2019s hard pass. We will not tolerate the inappropriate behaviour clearly documented in this video.\u201d\n\nThe video, which has no audio and is of notably low quality, shows the moment Mr Acosta\u2019s hand blocks the aide\u2019s attempts to grab the microphone. It repeats the moment six times, each time zooming further into the brief moment of contact.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He downloaded a gif file posted elsewhere, \u201czoomed in, saved it again as an mt2 file \u2013 then converted it to an mp4 [video file]\u201d, he told the site. He added: \u201cDigitally it\u2019s gonna look a tiny bit different after processing and zooming in, but I did not in any way deliberately \u2018speed up\u2019 or \u2018distort\u2019 the video.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
