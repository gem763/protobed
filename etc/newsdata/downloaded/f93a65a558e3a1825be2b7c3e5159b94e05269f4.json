We've designed essentially our own methodology and platform to collect this data.\"\n\nSee also: 3 ways state actors target businesses in cyber warfare, and how to protect yourself (TechRepublic)\n\nThe research also identified that the top three networks associated with what was dubbed as the \"highest lifestyle\" \u2013 or as Kaafar explained the most difficult threat to remove \u2013 had originated from China.\n\n\"It doesn't necessarily mean there's an organisational aspect behind it but it's just happening there, and we should really big looking closely to those big contributors that constitute of a vast majority of the activities,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, Kaafar said the research observed how malware activities were distributed across IP addresses, and pinpointed that one cloud server hosted in Amazon was the \"most repeated offender with high volumes of exploits\".\n\n\"They have been used over and over because it's a cheap resource for attackers and a convenient resource; they can migrate their service from one location to the other without being noticed,\" he said.\n\nOther trends that the research uncovered included how malicious activities have consistently been the dominant class of cyberattacks over the decade that was examined.\n\n\"Malicious activity has been steadily increasing in volume over the last decade. Essentially, we looked into the volume of malicious activity on a daily basis and we found the number of reports about cybercrime and events was increasing on a day to day basis. It started with a couple of hundred reports a day, to around a million activities a day,\" he said.\n\nOn phishing, the report showed how it started to emerge in 2009, which coincided with the increased adoption of smartphones, and according to Kaafar, phishing grew to a volume that represented almost 30% of all malicious activity in 2017.\n\nAccording to Kaafar, the analysis of the retrospective dataset will be made publicly available to drive not only further research, but be used to predict future cyberthreats.\n\n\"We're hopeful we'll be able to identify the next move of attackers, where the next school of attackers are, where the next big contributors to phishing and malware will be sitting,\" he said.\n\nRelated coverage", "description": "CSIRO's Data61 touts its FinalBlacklist report is the first and largest publicly available dataset of its kind.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/26/cf86071e-6574-4bd5-92fd-66dd691b8d70/thumbnail/770x578/87e219e4979f8a3a5787ccbd858ae410/cheap-and-years-old-creaky-malware-is-st-5d3abd5eb4b6ed000118daf3-1-jul-26-2019-9-31-39-poster.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
