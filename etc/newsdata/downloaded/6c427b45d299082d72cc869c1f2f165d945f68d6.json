At one point, aides said, Harris hired executive coaches for senior campaign management to cope with the problems \u2014 a move viewed internally as a recognition of their collective inexperience.\n\nAides point to scheduling bottlenecks occurring among the campaign\u2019s three top inside decision-makers: Rodriguez, Maya Harris and Harris, who has a reputation as a micromanager. Harris\u2019 outside consultants, Ace Smith and Sean Clegg, partners with Rodriguez and Butler at the San Francisco-based consulting firm SCRB, and ad man Jim Margolis, don\u2019t directly oversee campaign staff.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": ""}
