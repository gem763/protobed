I'm a proud, private person and do not want to ask anyone for help. I\u2019m suffering mentally. I\u2019m scratching my arms and legs,\" Miss Francis said.\n\n\"I\u2019m thinking all the time, when am I going to get water? When is this problem going to get sorted?\n\n\"My grandkids would come and stay over but now they can\u2019t.\n\n\"I can't turn on the central heating because the pressure is low, I just wrap myself in duvet and stay in my bedroom.\n\n\"I cannot cook because I\u2019m scared of the water running out. Sometimes I just eat at work. I used to cook a lot m- nothing beats your own food, your own bath and your own toilet.\"\n\n(Image: TIM EASTHOPE/BIRMINGHAM MAIL)\n\nThe trouble started last December when the water started running low in the bathroom.\n\nMiss Francis spent nearly \u00a3200 on a new shower unit, thinking that would solve the issue but it didn\u2019t.\n\nShe then contacted Severn Trent who sent out various workers to look at the problem. But the company claims it has been unable to gain access to the council property to look at the pipe.\n\nThe care worker added: \"I kept ringing and ringing them and nothing. They just kept saying they were trying to get in the house concerned and they couldn\u2019t.\n\n\"I decided I had had enough so I contacted the Consumer Council for Water but they could not do anything until Severn Trent had gone through all the steps.\u201d\n\nMiss Francis submitted a formal complaint on October 3.\n\n(Image: BPM MEDIA)\n\nShe has since heard that the problem has been caused by a leak on the private pipe which feeds all the nearby homes.\n\nChaman Lal, councillor for Soho and the Jewellery Quarter, said: \"The housing manager sent a team of plumbers to check the property for leaks and there\u2019s no problem which makes me angry.\n\n\"Severn Trent don\u2019t know what they are doing or do not want to know. This is appalling.\"\n\nA spokesman for Severn Trent said: \"We\u2019re really sorry for the problems Ms. Francis has experienced over recent months with her water supply. We understand that long periods of low water pressure must be extremely frustrating for her.\n\n\"Our engineers have been out to investigate the cause a number of times but, unfortunately efforts to fix the problem have proved to be complicated.\n\n(Image: BPM MEDIA)\n\n\"We believe the issue causing the low pressure is on a shared private pipe on private land, supplying a number of homes.\n\n\"Although it\u2019s the responsibility of the homeowner to fix private pipes, we still need their permission to access and investigate their individual section of pipe to confirm the exact location and cause, before any action can be taken.\n\n\"Unfortunately on this occasion, this has led to significant delays.\n\n\"We\u2019ll continue to support Ms. Francis to try and put everything right as soon as possible.\"", "description": "Jennifer Francis, of Winson Green, Birmingham, is embroiled in a row with Severn Trent since December last year", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Bpm Media", "Tim Easthope Birmingham Mail"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20662433.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BIR_Jennifer-Francis-03.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
