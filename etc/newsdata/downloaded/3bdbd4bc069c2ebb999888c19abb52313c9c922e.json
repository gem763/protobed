Back to normal next week.\n\nWhere top VCs are investing in edtech\n\nExtra Crunch media columnist Eric Peckham interviewed almost a dozen leading venture capitalists about the state of edtech, including Jennifer Carolan of Reach Capital, Aydin Senkut of Felicis Ventures, and Charles Birnbaum of Bessemer. There is still a lot of enthusiasm for the space, but the theses for these investors have diverged quite significantly.\n\nMarlon Nichols , Managing Partner at MaC Venture Capital (a new LA-based seed fund with investments in Catalyte, Codeverse, and Wonderschool): \u201cMany education technology companies target individual teachers, which presents a long path to sizable revenue (requires too many customers) while others usually attempt to navigate the lengthy and bureaucratic sales cycle of selling to school districts. VCs prefer companies that have short sales cycles that can scale revenue quickly so in general, edtech companies are difficult investments for venture capital. That said, education is a giant opportunity in the US because high quality education is not evenly distributed across communities or social classes. It\u2019s a crisis. Companies that address this at scale are attractive if the revenue model makes sense. That\u2019s why I led the first round into Wonderschool, which delivers high quality education and child care at costs relative to one\u2019s zip code. The schools double as the educator\u2019s home so there isn\u2019t a need for real estate investment.\u201d\n\nWhy is Dropbox reinventing itself? A chat with Dropbox VP of Product Adam Nash and CTO Quentin Clark\n\nDropbox may be known for its singular file storage product, but the company is adapting and changing as it seeks new customers and also learns more about what \u201cfile storage\u201d really means to users.", "description": "Editor\u2019s Note This week, we hosted 23 panels on all aspects of building startups on the Extra Crunch stage at TechCrunch Disrupt SF.
