At what point did he know? What did he authorize? What role did he play? he asked.\n\nGOP STORMS SECURE ROOM ON CAPITOL HILL, DISRUPTING DEPOSITION\n\nOne source added that DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's upcoming report on alleged FBI surveillance abuses against the Trump campaign will shed light on why Durham's probe has become a criminal inquiry. Horowitz announced on Thursday his report would be available to the public soon, with \"few\" redactions.\n\nRivera took issue with the New York Times' reporting about Durham's probe on its front page Friday. He said that below the headline, the Times \"minimizes\" the story by writing that there is \"fear that Trump is using the Justice Department to chase perceived enemies.\"\n\n\"Immediately they undercut the motive for the investigation. They don't care about the fact that the power of the intelligence agencies was used to undermine the President of the United States. They care that they're going to get caught for the exaggerations and the lies,\" he said, stressing that the Mueller probe did not find that Americans colluded with Russians to interfere in the 2016 election.\n\nThe investigation's new status means Durham can subpoena witnesses, file charges, and impanel fact-finding grand juries.\n\nFox News reported on Tuesday that Durham's probe had expanded significantly based on new evidence uncovered during a recent trip to Rome with Attorney General Bill Barr.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBarr reportedly told embassy officials in Italy that he \"needed a conference room to meet high-level Italian security agents where he could be sure no one was listening in.\"\n\nRivera said the Trump-Russia collusion investigation, which became the Mueller probe, was viewed as a \"rock they were pushing up the hill\" toward the goal of removing Trump from office.\n\n\"Then they found we don't have the evidence. Now the rock is coming back on them,\" he said, questioning whether the \"secret\" impeachment inquiry is a continuation of the same effort.\n\nFox News' Gregg Re and Ed Henry contributed to this report.", "description": "Former Obama administration officials should be concerned after\u00a0the investigation of the origins of the Trump-Russia probe became a criminal matter, Fox News correspondent-at-large Geraldo Rivera said Friday.", "authors": ["David Montanaro", "David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/geraldo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
