The replica is based on 16th century documentary sources, which guided the designers in recreating the original ships dimensions and features.\n\nAnother replica ship is currently being constructed and will be on permanent display in Seville to mark the 500th anniversary of the Nao Victoria's circumnavigation of the globe.", "description": "The Nao Victoria took three years to sail around the world, setting off in 1519.", "authors": ["Luke Hurst"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/33/84/1000x563_cmsv2_25458667-3f08-5103-8d25-cb085843e9d1-4263384.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
