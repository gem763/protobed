We created voice applications to demonstrate both hacks on both device platforms, turning the assistants into \"Smart Spies\".'\n\nOne app was designed to trick users into thinking their device no longer listening by announcing a fake error message after being roused by a wake-word.\n\nIn reality, however, the app remains open with the microphone engaged which would allow hackers to eavesdrop on any subsequent conversations within earshot.\n\nAnother attack serves users a fake prompt asking for users to update their systems by spelling out their password. That transcript is then captured and sent to a remote server.\n\nGoogle's brand of smart home products like its Nest Mini (pictured above) are among the most popular voice-controlled products on the market (File photo)\n\n'All Actions on Google are required to follow our developer policies, and we prohibit and remove any Action that violates these policies. We have review processes to detect the type of behavior described in this report, and we removed the Actions that we found from these researchers,' a Google spokesperson told MailOnline.\n\n'We are putting additional mechanisms in place to prevent these issues from occurring in the future.'\n\nResearchers say exploits should act as a wake-up call for users of microphone-enabled smart home devices who may not be aware the technology can be exploited by hackers.\n\n'The privacy implications of an internet-connected microphone listening in to what you say are further reaching than previously understood,' the researchers write.\n\n'Users need to be more aware of the potential of malicious voice apps that abuse their smart speakers. Using a new voice app should be approached with a similar level of caution as installing a new app on your smartphone.'\n\nGoogle, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft were all recently swept up in their own scandals after the companies were found to be using contractors to pore over voice-commands given by users of their products.\n\nThe programs often scraped up audio not intended for their devices like business calls, sex, porn searches, and other private conversations.", "description": "Spying apps bypassed Amazon and Google's defenses and were approved by the moderation teams - a lapse experts say invites even more scrutiny on products.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/16/18407844-0-image-a-7_1571672557999.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
