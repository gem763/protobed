We\u2019re here to create a legacy,\u201d captain Chris Vui said afterwards.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Auvergne\u2019s Tim Nanai-Williams found Leiua and the Bristol man, who shifted to the wing in a late injury-enforced change, jinked his way over in the corner.\n\nBut the Russian setpiece and kicking game that concerned Samoa coach Steve Jackson before kick off tested his side\u2019s discipline and as the penalty count ticked up, Russia flyhalf Yury Kushnarev knocked two over for a 6-5 lead.\n\nWith World Rugby publicly criticising the officiating over the first weekend of the World Cup shortly before kick off, Romain Poite had a decision to make on 28 minutes when centre Lee-Lo went in high on Russia captain Vasily Artemyev.\n\nPoite and his television match official deemed that Artemyev had dipped slightly into the tackle and made the same call two minutes later when a near identical tackle sent hooker Matu\u2019u to the bin.\n\nTheir opponents were unable to make anything from the two-man advantage, something Artemyev rued after the game as the punishing four-day turnaround from the Japan defeat began to show among their unchanged side in the second half.\n\nAmosa put the Samoans back in front with a try just after the break and Gotvotsev\u2019s yellow card for catching him high just as he was about to score ended Amosa\u2019s night too after his knee buckled in the collision.\n\nMatu\u2019u also failed a head injury assessment and could miss their Sept. 30 clash with Scotland in Kobe.\n\nSamoa showed how to use the 10-minute advantage and put the game out of sight by the time Gotvotsev returned, first with the kind of flair Vui promised before the game as replacement hooker Ray Niuia\u2019s delicious no-look reverse pass put Fidow through.\n\nThe winger got his second minutes later before Lee-Lo and Leiua rounded the score off against the Russians, who now have nine days off until they meet Ireland in Kobe.", "description": "Samoa survived being reduced to 13 men for almost 10 minutes in the first half and struggled to overcome a
