Sign up here.\n\nDemocratic 2020 presidential hopeful and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is getting help from an unlikely source: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan.\n\n\n\nZuckerberg and Chan have approached Pete Buttigieg with names of people they thought should be added to his campaign staff, Bloomberg reported Monday.\n\nZuckerberg and Cha sent emails to Buttigieg campaign manager Mike Schmuhl with recommendations, and ultimately two of those people were hired: Eric Mayefsky, a senior digital analytics adviser, and Nina Wornhoff, an organizing data manager.\n\nMayefsky had worked for Facebook and Wornhoff had worked with the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the family\u2019s LLC aimed at combating disease, promoting education and other such efforts. A spokesman for the Zuckerberg and Chan said they were asked for recommendations and it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re backing Buttigieg.\n\n\u201cMark and Priscilla have not decided who to support for President,\u201d spokesman Ben LaBolt told Bloomberg.\n\nDemocrats aren't exactly racing for Zuckerberg\u2019s endorsement right now, anyway. Indeed, most of the Democratic field appears to be running against Silicon Valley, and spent good portion of last week\u2019s debate bashing Facebook.\n\nREAD: Democrats unfriended and blocked Silicon Valley last night\n\nDemocratic front-runner Senator Elizabeth Warren has called for Facebook to be broken up, while Joe Biden has spoken out against the company after it refused to take down an attack ad that lied about the former vice president.\n\nZuckerberg, meanwhile, has felt it necessary to go on a charm offensive \u2014 via private meetings and Fox News appearances \u2014 to convince high-profile Republicans that Facebook isn\u2019t biased against conservatives.\n\nREAD: Mark Zuckerberg just gave every politician a green light to lie in Facebook ads\n\nButtigieg\u2019s campaign played off the recommendations from Zuckerberg and Chan as the couple simply making introductions.\n\n\u201cFrom the CNN Town hall in March to our launch a month later, we literally got 7,000 resumes,\u201d campaign spokesman Chris Meagher told Bloomberg. \u201cI think that he (Zuckerberg) thought Eric would be a good staff hire with a lot of experience and same with Nina and Priscilla.\u201d\n\nButtigieg remains behind Warren, Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls, but he has some reason for optimism. He\u2019s had no issue raising money for his campaign, raking in dollars from Silicon Valley especially.\n\nA new poll from USA Today/Suffolk University also showed he had surged to third place in Iowa. The survey pegged support for Buttigieg at 13%, just five percentage points behind Biden and four behind Warren.\n\nCover: Democratic presidential hopeful South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg greets campaign volunteers before departing a rally outside the Reading Terminal Market in Center City Philadelphia, PA, on October 20, 2019 (Photo by Bastiaan Slabbers/NurPhoto via Getty Images)", "description": "A spokesman for Zuckerberg and wife Priscilla Chan said the couple have not decided yet whom to support for president.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5dadbea05c1f5f000a31be96/lede/1571667928292-mayor-pete.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.845732184808144xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
