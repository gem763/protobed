The demand, first reported by BuzzFeed News, came in a letter from Barr and and officials from the United Kingdom and Australia dated for October 4.\n\nThe letter asks Facebook to abandon its plan to put end-to-end encryption in place across its products unless it can guarantee there will be \u201cno reduction to user safety\u201d and \u201ca means for lawful access to the content of communications to protect our citizens\u201d will be included.\n\nThe attorney general, currently entangled in the impeachment threat surrounding President Donald Trump, argues that encryption would hinder criminal investigations and requested that Facebook allow law enforcement backdoor access into encrypted messaging.\n\nFacebook indicated it would not acquiesce to the demands.\n\n\u201cWe strongly oppose government attempts to build backdoors because they would undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement to The Daily Beast. \u201cWe believe people have the right to have a private conversation online, wherever they are in the world.\u201d\n\nEnd-to-end encryption, widely regarded as the gold standard for secure communications, prevents any outside parties from viewing a message by scrambling its contents until it reaches its intended recipient. WhatsApp messages are currently encrypted, encompassing more than 1.5 billion users.\n\n\u201c We strongly oppose government attempts to build backdoors because they would undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere \u201d\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in March that Facebook would be improving the privacy of its apps, including instituting end-to-end encryption on its messaging products beyond WhatsApp. As he made the announcement during the company\u2019s annual developer conference, the Facebook founder stood in front of a giant graphic that read, \u201cThe future is private.\u201d\n\nFacebook has weathered a number of scandals related to its approach to protecting consumers\u2019 personal information, though the social network still gets points among privacy advocates for expanding mainstream access to end-to-end encryption through WhatsApp.\n\nPrivacy advocates believe that encrypted messaging is a strong privacy plus for consumers, while detractors\u2014usually within law enforcement\u2014think the risks involved when a company can no longer monitor content on its platform outweigh any potential benefit.\n\nThe Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Barr argued that the social network\u2019s plan would hinder criminal investigations.", "authors": ["Blake Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570136271/191003-Montgomery-Barr-Facebook-tease_cou4bq"}
