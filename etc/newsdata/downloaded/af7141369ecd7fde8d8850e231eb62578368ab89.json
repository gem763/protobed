They\u2019re video and photo editors. They\u2019re defense lawyers. And today, they are media-criticism assassins, armed with iPhones and unlimited data. The stans dived deep into Seth Abramovitch\u2019s BTS profile for The Hollywood Reporter, exposing inaccuracies, culturally insensitive implications, and generally calling out THR for sending someone who, on top of having little to no prior knowledge about BTS, openly admitted that in the article.\n\nThe Army is known for being passionate. They already have beef with The Hollywood Reporter for calling BTS\u2019s label, Big Hit Entertainment, a \u201csausage mill,\u201d so the ice was just thinning. Crack! Among other things, they\u2019re now taking issue with the suggestion that BTS is competitive with other bands and the implication that SHINee band member Kim Jonghyun\u2019s suicide was a result of K-pop\u2019s rigorous \u201cHunger Games\u201d trainee programs. And just because they have the time, they\u2019ve also taken issue with Abramovitch\u2019s old Gawker posts, especially one where he used a slur. Gawker cannot catch a break.\n\nThe Army\u2019s major problems with the article target aspects of the K-pop industry that are foreign (in some cases, quite literally. Stans aren\u2019t happy with Abramovitch\u2019s explanation of the word maknae) to the Western music industry and require nuance. Because it\u2019s not like K-pop fans are blind to the industry\u2019s faults and are raging after THR for no reason. They just want to be taken seriously and treated fairly. So, while it\u2019s fun to watch stans host a live roast on your Twitter feed, what they\u2019re actually getting at (and what writer Jae-Ha Kim points to in a Twitter thread) is the need for knowledgable, preferably Korean-American writers to be flown to Seoul to drink soju with the boys of BTS so that stans can make fan edits of the photographs instead of writing incredibly sick burns like the ones below.\n\nMy cat could write a better article bitch \u2014 Missing Namjoon on daily basis (@joonienammu) October 2, 2019\n\nthat\u2019s not how you spell \u2018big disappointment\u2019, sir \u2014 taetae (@sorreev) October 2, 2019\n\nI understand you're The \"Hollywood\" Reporter, but if your publication enjoys privileging its Western identity so much, please refrain from doing articles about Asian entertainment. Unless you send reporters from those actual cultures to write them, but wow that's a long-shot... \u2014 alapadma (@alapadma2) October 2, 2019\n\nThanks but no thanks keep it. Better left in drafts.
