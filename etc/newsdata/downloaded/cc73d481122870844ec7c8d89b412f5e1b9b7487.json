So much so that he needed to be consoled on the sideline, to be told, \"Man, you just got to continue to play football.\"\n\n\"My mind was all on him,\" Davidson said. \"Like, I hope he gets up, I hope he feels better, I hope it\u2019s nothing serious. Because, at the end of the day, man, it\u2019s football. You want to see everybody be great.\u201d\n\nSo the idea that Florida coach Dan Mullen thought the play the Auburn defensive end made against quarterback Kyle Trask early in the second quarter was \"dirty\" doesn't sit well with anyone on the Plains.\n\nThe Gators had first-and-10 from their own 25 after the Tigers' lone touchdown of the afternoon. Davidson rushed from Trask's blindside, and as he did, left tackle Stone Forsythe grabbed him by the jersey collar and pulled him toward the turf.\n\nThe result was Davidson landing on Trask's left leg after he released the ball, sending the awkwardly to the ground. He limped straight to the home locker room after being checked on by trainers, but did return to the game two drives later (with a brace on his left knee) and finished the Gators' 24-13 victory over the Tigers 19 of 31 passing for 234 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nDuring a halftime interview with Jamie Erdahl on the CBS broadcast, Mullen said \"Hopefully the league really tries to keep quarterbacks safe from dirty plays.\"\n\nThe Florida head coach doubled down during his postgame news conference, even after initially saying \"I didn\u2019t see the play. I saw part of it and saw it on the replay.\"\n\n\"Here's my deal, is intention or not, I mean, we've got to try to do a good job of protecting guys out there on the field,\" Mullen said. \"I mean that's what the rules are in place for. I go down and watch it on film and see what happens. I'm certainly not saying they're trying to do that. They're not being coached to do that. I don't think the guys' intent is to do that. You know what I mean? But we have rules in place to protect players and we'll look on film to see whether or not there was a targeting, whether there was a low hit. Hit the quarterback low, I mean, what the explanation on those is.\"\n\nDavidson said he was \"just trying to make a play\" and that the tackle \"was pushing me down.\" He added that he \"always play between the rules\" and actively tries to take care of other players in the same way that he hopes they would take care of him.\n\n\"I felt really bad for Trask, man,\" the senior continued. \"I really did. It hurt. It really did. I was out of it for a moment, because you don\u2019t ever want to see that happen to player. You know what I mean? After the game, I went up and apologized to him. At the end of the day, it\u2019s football, but you never wish nothing bad on nobody.\"\n\nDavidson did find Trask on the field after the game, gave him a hug and spoke to him for a few seconds.\n\n\"I told him after the game, I said, \u2018Good job for fighting. I understand that you\u2019re banged up and stuff,'\" Davidson said. \"I apologized for that and told him I\u2019m praying for you.\u201d\n\nGus Malzahn responded to Mullen's comments on Sunday, and added that he has not spoken to the Florida head coach since the game ended:\n\n\"Marlon is not a dirty player,\" Auburn's head coach said. \"Matter of fact, Marlon is one of the best football players in our league. He\u2019s probably one of the classiest, if not the classiest, in our league and we\u2019re honored and proud he\u2019s one of our leaders.\"", "description": "The idea that Florida coach Dan Mullen thought the hit on QB Kyle Trask in Saturday's game was \"dirty\" doesn't sit well with anyone at Auburn.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/07/PMOY/02993f14-eeb7-43dd-889e-4b28feb37f4b-AP_19278783977810.jpg?crop=3643,2049,x1,y229&width=3072&height=2049&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
