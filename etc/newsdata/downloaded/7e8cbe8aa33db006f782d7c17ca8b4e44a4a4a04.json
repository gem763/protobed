We have been consistent that we will only ever consider supporting arrangements that are in Northern Ireland's long-term economic and constitutional interests and protect the integrity of the Union.\"\n\nIf they voted against, his magic number goes up to 330 - but they might not go that far. If they abtstain, it lowers the threshold for victory - but he will need to claw back those votes somewhere else.\n\nOn top of that, it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that a lot of the hard Brexiteer MPs that make up his 285-vote baseline will take their cues from the DUP on whether they will back the deal.\n\nFormer Tories\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIn total there are 20 ex-Tory MPs that have had the whip removed for rebelling against the PM. With Amber Rudd, who resigned the whip over Brexit , and you\u2019ve got 21.\n\nNot all of these are hard-bitten retainers. A lot of them want a deal, and voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal back in March. It\u2019s possible a chunk of them could swing behind the government on Saturday - especially if the carrot of having the whip restored is dangled in front of them.\n\nIt\u2019s understood at least some of the awkward Tories will be meeting with Number 10 later today.\n\nAnd at least one - Stephen Hammond - has said this morning that he's minded to vote for Johnson's deal.\n\nPlus you\u2019ve got Charlie Elphicke, who is currently sitting as an Independent after having the Conservative whip removed. He could be helpful to Johnson.\n\nLabour Brexiteers\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nIn reality, it is unlikely all of the 21 former Conservatives would support a Withdrawal Agreement - but up to about a dozen Labour backbenchers could support a deal.\n\nThey include Kate Hoey and Kevin Barron, both of whom have said they are standing down at the next general election .\n\nOthers may abstain, lowering the threshold for a Government victory.", "description": "The Prime Minister's deal still has a number of hurdles to jump.
