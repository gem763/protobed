Skin-On imitates human skin not just in the way it makes us feel, but also in the way it looks.\n\nSkin-On has multiple layers, just like human skin -- a surface textured layer, an electrode layer of conductive threads and a hypodermis layer. The artificial skin is also capable of detecting a number of gestures made by the wearer. The artificial skin allows devices to feel the user from simple grasping (while also acknowledging its pressure and location) along with several other ways of interaction like twisting, pinching or even tickling.\n\nMarc Teyssier, the lead author of this study further added, \"Artificial skin has been widely studied in the field of Robotics but with a focus on safety, sensing or cosmetic aims. This is the first research we are aware of that looks at exploiting realistic artificial skin as a new input method for augmenting devices.\"\n\nDon't Miss 199 SHARES 1.4 K SHARES 211 SHARES 44.1 K SHARES 6.8 K SHARES\n\nSkin on\n\nHe further added, \"One of the main use of smartphones is mediated communication, using text, voice, video, or a combination. We implemented a messaging application where users can express rich tactile emotions on artificial skin. The intensity of the touch controls the size of the emojis.\"\n\nThe researchers attached this to a smartphone case to use the touch-sensitivity to do various kinds of tasks including changing volume, using certain gestures for sending the right emoji etc. For example, a tickling gesture on the case would signify laughing emoji whereas a strong grasp could signify anger. They have also created Skin-On as a watch-strap for wearable smartwatches, and as trackpads for laptops.\n\nSkin on\n\nHowever, this isn't it. Researchers are also planning to make Skin-On look far more realistic by embedding hair and temperature sensors that would give it 'goosebumps'.\n\nWhat do you feel about Skin-On? Would you find a case like this cool or creepy?
