Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), who resorted to a controversial decades-old talking point that pro-choice supporters say only further stigmatizes abortion at a critical moment.\n\nWhen moderators asked what candidates would do to stop the recent wave of abortion bans if elected president, Gabbard responded by referencing a phrase first popularized by the Clintons in 1996.\n\n\u201cI agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing. In the 1990s, when Bill Clinton was president and she said abortion should be \u2018safe, legal, and rare,\u2019 I think she\u2019s correct,\u201d Gabbard said.\n\nBut that phrase\u2014\u201csafe, legal, and rare\"\u2014was questionable even back when the Clintons first used it to describe the Democratic Party\u2019s position on abortion in the 1990s.\n\nThe phrase marked a significant departure from earlier rallying cries like \u201cabortion on demand, without apology\u201d that once prevailed among pro-choice supporters. Katha Pollitt, the author of 2014 book Pro: Reclaiming Abortion Rights, has described the Clintons' decision as a moment that helped usher in the \u201cawfulization\u201d of abortion, by which she meant referring to abortion as something regrettable, unfortunate, and to be avoided at all costs.\n\nReproductive rights advocates said this tendency was on display Tuesday night, when Gabbard hearkened back to the Clinton-era stance.\n\n\u201cI cannot think of a less compelling way to advocate for something than saying that it should be rare,\u201d said Amelia Bonow, the cofounder of Shout Your Abortion, a platform for abortion storytelling. \u201cAnd anyone who uses that phrase is operating from the assumption that abortion is a bad thing.\u201d\n\nIn the most basic sense, it\u2019s simply not true that abortion is rare, Bonow pointed out: About one in four women in the U.S. will have one by age 45. Among those who have already had an abortion, hearing Gabbard's argument was painful, said Alison Dreith, the director of Illinois\u2019 Hope Clinic.\n\n\u201cPeople who have had abortions are not here for that answer,\u201d Dreith said. \u201cI am one of the women who has had an abortion in my lifetime and I think it\u2019s deeply offensive and stigmatizing.\u201d\n\nThough Gabbard echoed other candidates\u2019 support for the codification of Roe v. Wade into federal law, the comment made it clear Gabbard is out of step with her fellow 2020 contenders, Dreith said.\n\nGabbard added that she would also ensure that \u201cabortion is not an option in the third trimester, giving into anti-choice fear-mongering around so-called \u201clate-term abortions.\u201d This cycle, presidential candidates have begun to take bolder pro-choice stances on abortion rights on the whole, making Gabbard\u2019s use of the line \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d feel especially dated.\n\nEarlier this year, former Vice President Joe Biden came under fire for reaffirming his support for the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funds from going toward abortion services in the U.S\u2014and essentially amounts to a ban on abortion for low-income Americans. Biden later reversed his stance, demonstrating that supporting a repeal of the 1976 amendment had become something of a litmus test for 2020 candidates.\n\n\u201cAdvocates have long been really pushing this message of how important overturning the Hyde Amendment is,\u201d Dreith said. \u201cThat is not a fight that even advocates in our own movement thought was doable, and look where we\u2019re at now.\u201d\n\nBut while Gabbard\u2019s call back to \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d may have seemed out of place on the debate stage, reproductive rights advocates say the Democratic Party and the abortion rights movement more broadly have yet to fully embrace an unapologetic stance on the issue.\n\n\u201cThe popular consensus is that \u2018rare\u2019 is stigmatizing and as a movement we sort of pat ourselves on the back at the idea that we\u2019ve traded it in for \u2018safe, legal, and accessible,\u2019\u201d said Robin Marty, author of Handbook for a Post-Roe America. \u201cBut the reality is that it\u2019s still there, lingering in the back of the reproductive rights movement\u2019s language even if the word \u2018rare\u2019 itself is no longer used.\u201d\n\nMarty said she noticed the phenomenon just recently, when a new report showed that abortion rates in the U.S. have continued to decline, reaching a record low.\n\n\u201cBoth the right and the left scramble to be the first to claim that it\u2019s their policies\u2014more birth control access or more abortion restrictions\u2014that brought those rates down,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd on Tuesday night she also noticed many 2020 Democrats shy away from using the word \u201cabortion,\u201d instead preferring terms like \u201creproductive healthcare\u201d and \u201creproductive freedom,\u201d which some say is a way of avoiding talking straightforwardly about the procedure.\n\nWith Roe v. Wade under direct threat\u2014the Supreme Court recently agreed to hear its first abortion-related case\u2014Marty and others agree it\u2019s critical that Democrats coalesce around strong messaging in favor of abortion rights.\n\nIf the party tiptoes around the issue, it has already conceded, she added.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to win this fight is to create a culture where people can talk openly about the way abortion has helped their family, their community and allowed them to live their best life,\u201d Bonow said. \u201c\u2018Safe, legal, and rare\u2019 forces people back into a place of silence and shame, and makes it difficult for people to advocate unapologetically and unshamefully for abortion rights.\u201d\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Marie Solis on Twitter .", "description": "The phrase \"safe, legal, and rare\u201d only further stigmatizes abortion, experts say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da797f9c61fda000a2bf7df/lede/1571265938744-GettyImages-1181331385.jpeg?crop=0.9288xw:0.7828xh;0.035xw,0.0944xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
