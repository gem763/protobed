Greenwood is showing more promise and is expected to score 0.55 goals per game - the same as Dembele.\n\nIn the past calendar year Dembele has had 133 shots on goal, which averages out at 3.18 per game.\n\nUnited striker Rashford has fired the ball at goal 137 times, but surprisingly averages less shots on per game with just 2.82.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMartial and Greenwood have obviously played fewer games and have had 54 and 23 shots on goal in total, with a shots per game average of 2.03 and 3.91 respectively.\n\nThe stats therefore show that it is young Greenwood, on average, who is more aggressive in front of goal.\n\nWhat's more the teenager has the second best shots on target percentage of all four strikers.\n\nOf his shots on goal, 47.83 per cent have hit the target compared to 46.72 per cent of Rashford's and, worst of all, 44.36 per cent of Dembele's.\n\nMartial ranks first in this area, hitting the target with 48.15 per cent of his shots.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nConsidering these stats it appears clear that both Rashford and Martial are better suited as wide forwards, while Dembele and Greenwood - who are both busier in front of goal and expected to score more often over 90 minutes - are better as front men.\n\nThis is also apparent when looking at the assist stats of each forward.\n\nWhile Dembele has made four assists in 57 matches, Rashford has made nine and Martial, in just 34 matches, has made two. Greenwood, meanwhile, hasn't made any.\n\nBoth Rashford and Martial play more crosses than Dembele, while the Man United duo also complete more dribbles over 90 minutes.\n\nIn conclusion, it is obvious the Frenchman is more of a traditional forward - a man whose aim is to put the ball in the back of the net, rather than bring other players into the game in the way Rashford and Martial do.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nGreenwood is also this man, but is perhaps a little young at this point to lead the line on his own at Old Trafford.\n\nIt therefore seems that Dembele would be a good signing, as his killer instinct in front of goal would see him make the most of the chances both Martial and Rashford create.", "description": "Manchester United will get the chequebook out in January to sign a new forward - but is Moussa Dembele the right man?", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Afp Getty Images", "Pa", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18857955.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-EURO2019-U21-BGR-FRA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
