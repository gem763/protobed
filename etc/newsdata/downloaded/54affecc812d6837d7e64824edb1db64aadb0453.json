But petitioners claim that officials have cut around 2,500 trees.\n\nLocal residents, students and environmental activists clashed with police on Friday as they took to the streets to stop authorities, and even broke through barricades to enter Aarey colony. More than 50 people were arrested and police imposed restrictions on public gatherings.\n\nThe protests grabbed the national spotlight over the weekend, and the Supreme Court took suo moto (without a formal complaint from any party) notice.\n\nWhat did the Supreme Court say?\n\nA special two-judge bench heard the matter on Monday after students wrote to the chief justice, asking the court to intervene and save the trees.\n\nThe court asked the state government of Maharashtra, where Mumbai is located, to not cut any more trees.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Police arrested more than 50 protesters\n\nThe court also asked the government to maintain \"status quo\" - which means that no construction can take place - until 21 October when it will hear the matter again.\n\nThe court also ordered the release of all activists who were arrested or detained on bail.\n\nWhat is Aarey colony?\n\nSpread over 1,300 hectares (3,212 acres), Aarey is a densely forested area dotted with lakes and has the Mithi river flowing through it. It lies at the heart of Mumbai and is often referred to as its last green lung.\n\nIt's locally known as the Aarey \"milk colony\" because most of the land was given to the department of dairy development in 1951. But they are allowed to grow cattle fodder only on a fraction of the land.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Protesters broke through barricades and clashed with police on Friday\n\nEarlier this year, officials cleared some 40 hectares of the forested area to build a zoo, complete with a night safari. And now, locals complain, another slice of it is in danger from the metro construction.\n\nThey also fear that the government will eventually clear the way for private builders to encroach on the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, which lies to the north of Aarey colony.\n\nOfficials, however, dismiss these fears as unfounded and point out that the construction for the metro only requires 30 hectares.\n\nHow crucial is the metro rail for Mumbai?\n\nThe city badly needs a \"mass rapid transport system,\" Ashwini Bhide, managing director of the Mumbai metro rail corporation, had told the BBC earlier.\n\nThe land in Aarey colony, she said, was \"the most suitable land due to its size, shape and location\".\n\nShe has also been defending the decision to cut the trees on Twitter.\n\nIndia's financial hub is congested and infamous for its crawling traffic jams.\n\nIts colonial-era local train system ferries some 7.5 million people between the city's suburbs and its centre on a daily basis.\n\nOfficials say that the metro will eventually carry around 1.7 million passengers every day and bring down the number of vehicles on the road by up to 650,000.", "description": "It intervened amid protests against the felling of thousands of trees to build a metro parking unit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1822E/production/_109126889_gettyimages-1174173264.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
