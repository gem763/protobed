His reelection machine is huge \u2014 and armed with consultants.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nEmployees for President Trump's 2020 reelection campaign work in July at the Republican National Convention annex in Arlington, Va. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in 2015 had no pollster, rapid-response team or fundraiser. A bare-bones staff fueled by pizza and energy drinks toiled in a makeshift office at Trump Tower. His opponents vastly outspent him \u2014 and lost.\n\nBut as president, Trump\u2019s campaign machine has dramatically escalated, powered by a historically large war chest of donations large and small that has given him a head start over the eventual Democratic nominee.\n\nAt this point in the last election, Trump\u2019s campaign employed 19 consultants. Now, there are more than 200. When Trump had all but locked up the nomination by May 2016, he had spent $63 million. Thus far, pro-Trump committees have spent $531 million.\n\nPart of that money has been used to try to influence the Democratic primary. The committees recently launched a $10 million ad offense targeting Democrats, particularly former vice president Joe Biden, in early primary states.\n\nThe spending has also created a financial boon for a political-consulting class he once shunned.\n\nSince 2017, nearly $92 million has flowed to dozens of firms providing political consulting services to Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection machine, according to an analysis of campaign spending by The Washington Post.\n\nHighest-paid consultants to pro-Trump committees since 2017 0 10 20 $30 million Parscale Strategy $33.6M Target Point Consulting Direct Persuasion Red Curve Solutions Opn Sesame Giles-Parscale Grassroots Targeting National Capital Teleservices Jamestown Associates Public Opinion Strategies Note: In some cases the money may have been passed to other vendors.

Source: Federal Election Commission reports THE WASHINGTON POST\n\nBeneficiaries of that money include a mix of experienced hands who have long been part of the GOP establishment and a newer crop of strategists who rode Trump\u2019s coattails to a potentially lucrative career in presidential politics.\n\nThe hiring of these consultants marks a major shift from 2016, when Trump\u2019s upstart campaign won the GOP nomination on a shoestring budget and without a robust staff to carry out basic campaign functions, like polling, door-knocking and advertising.\n\nTrump\u2019s team in 2016 was \u201cbuilding the airplane while it was in flight. To their everlasting credit, they landed that airplane,\u201d Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said. \u201cLast time, it was insurgency. And this time, there is a feeling of insurgency \u2014 but the candidate, after all, is the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nTrump touted his lean operation as a testament to his business savvy, comparing it favorably to his opponents, who were armed with expensive campaign consultants: \u201cThe consultants and the fundraisers and all of these people, they take the money. ... Better than being a real estate broker, to be honest with you,\u201d Trump, a real estate developer, joked in 2015.\n\n\u201c I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff. But small is good, flexible, save money and number one!\u201d Trump in June 2016 \u201c I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff. But small is good, flexible, save money and number one!\u201d Trump in June 2016 \u201c I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff. But small is good, flexible, save money and number one!\u201d Trump in June 2016\n\nNow, Trump has a roaring reelection apparatus. There are six main committees working to secure his second term, including the official campaign, the Republican National Committee and a super PAC. Together, they have already raised over $736 million \u2014 more than any previous presidential candidate at this point in the campaign.\n\nNearly $92 million of that money has flowed to 76 vendors that provide political consulting, each one drawing at least $50,000 from these committees since 2017, according to a Post analysis of federal campaign filings.\n\nSome of those pulling in the most are run by well-known Trump loyalists, including campaign manager Brad Parscale, former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, longtime bodyguard Keith Schiller, and former White House spokesmen Sean Spicer and Raj Shah.\n\nOthers are longtime GOP firms that worked for his 2016 opponents. Top recipients of Trump reelection spending include McIntosh Co., formerly a fundraising consultant for the super PAC supporting former Florida governor Jeb Bush, and Pluvious Group, formerly a fundraising consultant for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). Representatives for these companies did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThese payments, reported in federal filings, do not indicate whether individuals running or managing the companies are personally profiting. In many cases, payments are passed on to other vendors or pay for staff salaries.\n\nThe spending shows how much Trump is benefiting from the decision, different from his predecessors, to begin fundraising for his second term as soon as he was elected. He has been as successful at raising money from his loyal base giving $20 at a time as he has with wealthy donors giving six figures.\n\n\n\nTrump campaign manager Brad Parscale. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThe expenditures also illustrate how dramatically Trump\u2019s operation has evolved since mounting his unorthodox campaign for the White House four years ago.\n\nWhen he was the underdog, Trump criticized the Republican establishment as sharply as he attacked Democrats. He even accused leaders of his own party of trying to undermine him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not part of the corrupt system. In fact, the corrupt system is trying to stop me,\u201d Trump said in August 2016. \u201cThe voters in the Republican Party this year defied the donors, the consultants, the power brokers and chose a nominee from outside our failed and corrupt broken system. The nominee is me.\u201d\n\nBut Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign committee and the party are working in lockstep.\n\nNo one embodies this transformation more than Parscale, a Web developer from San Antonio with no previous political experience. He was tapped from obscurity to build the 2015 website for Trump\u2019s presidential exploratory committee. He has said he did the initial task for a fee of $1,500.\n\nParscale is now the Trump 2020 campaign manager. Three businesses associated with Parscale have received a combined $38 million since 2017 from five committees working to reelect Trump, including the Republican National Committee.\n\nPayments to businesses associated with Parscale $38 million since 2017 Republican National Committee Trump campaign Great America Committee Trump Victory Trump Make America Great Again America First Action Businesses associated with Brad Parscale Note: Most of the payments are salaries or passed on to other vendors, per campaign Payments to businesses associated with Parscale $38 million since 2017 Republican National Committee Trump campaign Great America Committee Trump Victory America First Action Trump Make America Great Again Businesses associated with Brad Parscale Note: Most of the payments are salaries or passed on to other vendors, per campaign Payments to businesses associated with Parscale $38 million since 2017 Republican National Committee Trump campaign Great America Committee Trump Victory America First Action Trump Make America Great Again Businesses associated with Brad Parscale Note: Most of the payments are salaries or passed on to other vendors, per campaign\n\nParscale declined to be interviewed for this story. The bulk of the payments to Parscale\u2019s company, Parscale Strategy, is used for salaries and overhead, campaign officials said. The campaign set up a company, American Made Media Consultants, to place all ads for the reelection and to separate Parscale\u2019s personal interests from the campaign\u2019s advertising, officials said.\n\nLewandowski\u2019s firm, Green Monster Consulting, received more than $200,000 since 2017 by two of the committees supporting Trump\u2019s reelection: the America First Action super PAC and the Great America Committee, which is Vice President Pence\u2019s leadership PAC.\n\nLewandowski said his firm is no longer paid by the super PAC and declined to answer additional questions about his work. From June 2018 through July, Lewandowski\u2019s firm received $10,000 per month from the Great America Committee.\n\nPayments to Lewandowski\u2019s consulting business More than $200,000 since 2017 Republican National Committee Trump campaign Great America Committee Trump Victory Trump Make America Great Again America First Action Corey Lewandowski's company, Green Monster Consulting Payments to Lewandowski\u2019s consulting business More than $200,000 since 2017 Republican National Committee Trump campaign Great America Committee Trump Victory America First Action Trump Make America Great Again Corey Lewandowski's company, Green Monster Consulting Payments to Lewandowski\u2019s consulting business More than $200,000 since 2017 Republican National Committee Trump campaign Great America Committee Trump Victory America First Action Trump Make America Great Again Corey Lewandowski's company, Green Monster Consulting\n\nBoth men are now prominent party figures in Washington, working alongside the establishment.\n\nParscale speaks regularly with Karl Rove about campaign fundraising, according to someone familiar with their conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Rove, one of the most influential architects of the modern GOP political fundraising machine, was publicly critical of Trump in 2016.\n\nLewandowski, now a regular television commentator amplifying Trump\u2019s message, is a Washington lobbyist considering a run for a U.S. Senate seat in New Hampshire.\n\nShah declined to comment. Schiller\u2019s attorney did not respond to a request for comment. Spicer said his company is being paid for his work as a senior adviser and spokesman to the America First Action super PAC, and he helps with fundraising and publicity for the group.\n\nAsked whether the slew of political consultants has diminished the outsider appeal of Trump\u2019s candidacy, Murtaugh said: \u201cDonald Trump is who he is, and nothing will ever change.\u201d Murtaugh noted the campaign is a massive enterprise that has already raised and spent hundreds of millions of dollars and \u201crequires a lot of people to help.\"\n\nSome consultants have played a crucial role in helping direct donors\u2019 money to the right recipient \u2014 a reflection of the sophisticated and organized fundraising and spending efforts that exist behind the scenes.\n\nA key example is the role of longtime Pence aide Marty Obst and the work of his firm, MO Strategies, that has received more than $660,000 since 2017 from four of the six committees.\n\nPayments to Obst\u2019s consulting firm More than $660,000 since 2017 Republican National Committee Trump campaign Great America Committee Trump Victory Reimbursements Trump Make America Great Again America First Action MO Strategies, a firm established by Marty Obst Payments to Obst\u2019s consulting firm More than $660,000 since 2017 Republican National Committee Trump campaign Great America Committee Trump Victory Reimbursements America First Action Trump Make America Great Again MO Strategies, a firm established by Marty Obst Payments to Obst\u2019s consulting firm More than $660,000 since 2017 Republican National Committee Trump campaign Great America Committee Trump Victory Reimbursements America First Action Trump Make America Great Again MO Strategies, a firm established by Marty Obst\n\nObst was a part of the team that launched the main pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action. After he left the group, his company provided consulting services for the Republican National Committee and an affiliated fundraising committee. He runs the Pence leadership PAC and is an unpaid strategist for the Trump campaign.\n\nObst declined to comment for this story.\n\nTrump is armed with a bigger reelection operation than his predecessors had at this stage in their campaigns.\n\nBy this point in 2011, the official committees working toward President Barack Obama\u2019s second term had raised at least $390 million \u2014 a little over half of what Trump has now, campaign filings show.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, one way Trump saved money was by leveraging his celebrity, bombast and larger-than-life personality to attract coverage in the media.\n\n\u201c My primary consultant is myself. ... You know, I have a good instinct for this stuff.\u201d Trump on March 2016 \u201c My primary consultant is myself. ... You know, I have a good instinct for this stuff.\u201d Trump on March 2016 \u201c My primary consultant is myself. ... You know, I have a good instinct for this stuff.\u201d Trump on March 2016\n\n\u201cHe was on TV all the time,\u201d said Alex Conant, GOP strategist and senior adviser to Rubio\u2019s 2016 campaign. It \u201cturned out to be a brilliant strategy, and one that doesn\u2019t require much campaign infrastructure \u2014 just a cellphone and proximity to a TV camera.\u201d\n\nTrump still enjoys those advantages. But he now has internal polling, a system to test messages on Facebook to figure out what ads resonate most with voters and a rapid-response team tasked with mounting a public relations offensive at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s night and day,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cBefore, it was like a forced arranged marriage between the RNC and the campaign. But now, by launching so early, you can think strategically about what services they need, when they need them, when they need to bring in-house or an outside person.\"\n\n[Trump\u2019s critics are targeting his donors, sparking fears of a backlash against disclosure]\n\nTrump\u2019s campaigning head start comes on top of the unique perks enjoyed by sitting presidents over their challengers, such as having the support of multiple official committees that work in tandem for the party\u2019s nominee.\n\nAlready, more than two dozen of the top-earning consultants are doing consulting work for multiple committees, highlighting how the sprawling operation relies on a core group of players. It also raises questions about how the groups are following rules barring coordination.\n\n\n\nCorey Lewandowski signs autographs during a Trump rally in Manchester, N.H., in August. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nKelly Sadler, a spokeswoman for the America First Action super PAC, said the group strictly adheres to all federal election rules and regulations prohibiting coordination between vendors.\n\nAmerica First Action said many of the vendors that worked for the super PAC and the party committee no longer are paid by the super PAC.\n\n\u201cWe have hired political professionals, both in-house and externally, who have worked in this field for years and take these obligations seriously,\u201d Sadler said.\n\nRNC officials said that as a part of their contracting process, they require evidence from potential vendors that they have established the necessary firewalls.\n\nAmong other top firms paid for political consulting by the party or the super PAC are a handful of limited-liability companies with little public presence or paper trails, obscuring the names of those who are running these businesses.\n\nTwo of those companies were St. James Strategies and Red Strategy Group, which shared an address with another Republican National Committee vendor, Red Wave Strategies. All three are housed at the Virginia law offices of Holtzman Vogel Josefiak Torchinsky.\n\nThe law firm said it does not comment on its clients.\n\nThe six Trump committees in The Post\u2019s analysis are Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, the Republican National Committee, the two affiliated fundraising committees, the official pro-Trump super PAC America First Action and the Great America Committee, which is Pence\u2019s leadership committee.", "description": "Since 2017, more than $92 million has flowed to dozens of firms providing political consulting services to Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection machine, The Washington Post found.", "authors": ["Michelle Ye Hee Lee", "National Political Enterprise", "Accountability Reporter Covering Money", "Influence In Politics", "Anu Narayanswamy", "Database Reporter For The Political Enterprise Team", "October At Am", "Michelle Ye Hee Lee Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S National Political Enterprise", "Accountability Team", "Covering Money"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zEVUO9EZlI2kHvyGuOwlUkxDzAM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5KCN5TVP64I6TFARUYEPTUGC2M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
