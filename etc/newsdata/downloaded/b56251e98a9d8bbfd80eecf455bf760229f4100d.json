We\u2019re in a wait-and-see mode with major risk events like Brexit and trade negotiations being kicked down the road.\u201d\n\nThe pound GBP=D3 stood just under a six-week high of $1.2385, hit overnight after a British law blocking a no-deal exit from the European Union came into force.\n\nThe South Korean won KRW= and New Zealand dollar NZD= drifted higher, the won holding close to a month high at 1,191.0 per dollar and the kiwi close to a three-week peak at $0.6434.\n\nExuberance was held back, however, by weak Chinese economic data that hit equities markets, with factory-gate prices shrinking at their fastest pace since August.\n\nRatings house Fitch on Tuesday cut growth forecasts for Europe and China citing rising protectionism.\n\nThe yuan CNY=CFXS held mostly flat around 7.1169 per dollar.\n\nTraders also remained cautious ahead of a key European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, at which policymakers are expected to ease monetary policy.\n\nThe euro EUR=EBS was flat at $1.1043, underneath an overnight high of $1.1067 hit following a Reuters report that Germany may set up public investment agencies to boost fiscal stimulus without breaching national spending rules.\n\n\u201cThis news caused some people to revise down their expectations for Thursday\u2019s ECB meeting, although I think that\u2019s entirely premature,\u201d said Marshall Gittler, chief strategist at ACLS Global, in a note.\n\n\u201cI think the small rally in EUR today just sets up the currency for a bigger fall on Thursday.\u201d\n\nMarket hopes for a trade breakthrough, meanwhile, rested on confidence overnight from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. He told Fox television that there had been \u201ca lot of progress\u201d on a U.S-China trade deal and that the U.S. side was \u201cprepared to negotiate\u201d.\n\nThe remarks pushed U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasuries US10YT=RR to a three-week high where they held in Asian trade. The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies .DXY at 98.359.\n\nSterling barely shifted when Britain\u2019s parliament voted, as expected, to stymie Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s bid for an early election, which prompted him to vow that he would secure a Brexit deal at an EU summit next month.\n\n\u201cWhile I am loath to go anywhere near the pound, I like what I see in the price action,\u201d said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne forex brokerage Pepperstone Group.\n\n\u201cIf GBP/USD kicks up through $1.2354 again, I would be looking for longs, with a stop through $1.2234.\u201d", "description": "The yen and swiss franc fell to five-week troughs on Thursday as investors looked for higher-risk currencies, emboldened by a report of German stimulus plans, diminishing chances of a no-deal Brexit and hopes of a trade war breakthrough.", "authors": ["Tom Westbrook", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428209357&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890CC", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
