Despite all of Trump\u2019s public complaints, members of the commission said, his campaign was supportive \u2014 giving them some hope that the same cycle of loud public complaints and accusations followed by eventual acquiescence will play out again.\n\nThen presidential candidates Donald Trump and Sen.

He added, \u201cI think Trump will take a much different posture with respect to the 2020 general election debates but, like everything else with Trump, that is totally unpredictable at this point.\u201d\n\nTrump did not directly answer a reporter\u2019s question in August about whether he\u2019d take part in 2020 general election debates, though he suggested he\u2019s \u201cthe one calling the shots,\u201d a position that would put him at odds with the nonpartisan commission. A White House spokesperson did not respond to a question from POLITICO this week about the president\u2019s plans now that the debates have been scheduled.\n\nTodd, for one, doesn\u2019t expect Trump play ball with the commission. \u201cI will be stunned if we see a one-on-one debate,\u201d he told Hewitt. \u201cI think he is going to avoid debates. ... He won\u2019t agree to appear on stage with his opponent.\u201d\n\nThere is no law mandating that a presidential candidate must debate, and Trump has proved willing to break with precedent. For instance, Trump effectively killed the daily White House news briefing, which was a mainstay in both recent Republic and Democratic administrations.\n\nTrump regularly takes reporters\u2019 questions during photo-ops with world leaders or in front of Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House, but the often chaotic interactions with journalists play out on his terms alone. When it comes to facing sustained questioning, as in a television interview, the president typically turns to more friendly hosts on Fox News and Fox Business.\n\nIf Trump rejects the commission\u2019s schedule, Todd suggested it could lead to a \u201csort of a Wild West\u201d in which networks compete to get the candidates on their respective stages. That would be a major shift in how the debates have been handled since the commission took the reins before the 1988 election.\n\nFor primary debates, the networks that produce them \u2014 such as CNN this week \u2014 also broadcast them. But the commission-sponsored debates are covered by the White House television pool, which includes the major broadcast and cable networks, all of which can air it live.\n\nAlso, the general election debates run commercial free for 90 minutes, whereas networks can insert ads into primary debates, with recent 2020 Democratic contests stretching as long as three hours.\n\nPrior to the formation of the commission, Fahrenkopf said, campaigns could reject moderators, with nearly 100 members of the media vetoed ahead of the 1984 Reagan-Mondale debates. That election prompted Georgetown and Harvard studies about better ways to conduct debates, he said, which led to the commission\u2019s founding three years later.\n\nFahrenkopf said that when selecting moderators, the commission \u2014 which includes board members experienced in moderating, like former ABC News anchor Charles Gibson and former PBS anchor Jim Lehrer \u2014 examines an individual journalist\u2019s body of work rather than focus on where they\u2019re employed.\n\nIn 2016, the commission tapped NBC\u2019s Lester Holt, ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz, CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, and Fox\u2019s Chris Wallace for the three presidential contests. (Raddatz and Cooper co-moderated the town hall debate.) And CBS\u2019 Elaine Quijano was selected for the vice presidential debate.\n\nFahrenkopf said \u201cthere\u2019s always criticism\u201d of the moderators, though he believes the overwhelming majority have been fair. He counts two instances in his 30-plus years when he believes the commission made a mistake and \u201cthe moderator inserted themselves when they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d He declined to give examples.\n\nOne incident frequently raised by critics, including Hewitt, was then-CNN anchor Candy Crowley injecting herself into the 2012 debate between President Barack Obama and then-former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney over the Benghazi attack.\n\nFahrenkopf said he isn\u2019t surprised Trump hasn\u2019t yet committed to three 2020 debates, acknowledging that \u201ccircumstances can change dramatically\u201d for a candidate between now and the first debate, which is scheduled for Sept. 29 at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.\n\nThe commission typically begins discussions with the candidates\u2019 representatives after the summer political conventions. Fahrenkopf predicted that Trump and the future Democratic nominee will have plenty of people offering \u201cthoughts about what they should do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just do what we do,\u201d he said, \u201cand hope that they\u2019re going to appear before the American people.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/68/ce/1afcc88d4676bef47aec068a842d/191018frank-fahrenkopf-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
