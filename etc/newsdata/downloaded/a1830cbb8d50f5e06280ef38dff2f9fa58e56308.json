There was a temporary pause in the acrimonious shouting, and the DA's councillors looked shocked, unsure whether to believe this was happening. Usually, disagreements in the caucus were resolved through debate and consensus; sometimes, decisions went to a vote.\n\nIn this instance the assistant whip, Rose Rau, had been unable to count the hands in the cramped space, and called for a division. Never before had there been a physical division between those for or against a particular position. To make matters worse, Suzette Little presented the matter as those for the mayor and those against her.\n\nAs the city councillors slowly moved to different sides of the room, councillor Malusi Booi led the singing of Senzeni Na? \u2013 'What have we done?' \u2013 a well-known struggle song, by the group opposing the motion.\n\nMayor De Lille threatened them with disciplinary action. This was becoming tense.\n\nThe issue dividing the caucus was a payment of R9 million to the V&A Waterfront for the 'maintenance of public open space'. A late memo had been circulated just before the city council convened, signed by De Lille, requesting authorisation for the extraordinary expenditure.\n\nThe DA councillors were uneasy about it: the contract with the Waterfront was outdated, such extra payments had not been made before, and the sup\u00adporting annexures were missing, as were the necessary signatures from officials. A flimsy legal opinion was attached, which indicated that a pay\u00adment could be made but didn't clarify why this particular payment was due.\n\nDuring the council's lunch break, the DA caucus had been hastily con\u00advened, and clear dividing lines had formed. De Lille had argued that the City was obliged to honour the contract with the Waterfront, even though it was an old agreement that needed to be reviewed. She claimed it was urgent and needed to go through immediately.\n\nBut Ian Neilson, the deputy mayor, had put his hand up and said bluntly that the sum being requested didn't have a sufficient justification. Other councillors had joined in, arguing that they hadn't been given sufficient information or supporting documents to decide the merits of the matter.\n\nDe Lille had become visibly frustrated, lambasting caucus members for their failure to comply. She'd then threatened to use her recess powers to push the payment through while council was no longer sitting. The meet\u00ading had become unruly.\n\nWhen Little, the chair, had asked for a show of hands, it was difficult to see the people at the rear, and Rau proposed that councillors physically separate.\n\nThey did so, and for a long moment, it wasn't clear which of the two groups was the larger, with a number of councillors hesitating in the mid\u00addle of the room before making their move. Then the group around Malusi Booi seemed to swell: they held the majority, and the payment request was rejected.\n\nThe DA councillors opposing the request questioned the true nature of the payment, particularly when De Lille threatened to take legal action to force the council's hand. In a meeting with senior officials after the council meeting, De Lille said that she would approach the courts for a declaratory order to compel the payment to be made. Caucus members were wor\u00adried that if the V&A Waterfront took the City to court, De Lille would ensure that the City administration didn't defend the case. (A subsequent investigation by the DA noted there was probably no justification for any payment, since the matter was never brought back to council.)\n\nThe DA's leadership subsequently lambasted the decision by the caucus chair to call for a physical division as a fractious move that had intimidated members of the caucus, escalated tensions and sown further divisions in an already acrimonious environment. But the die had been cast, and it was as if a poison bomb had exploded inside the caucus. The damage to the party was irrevocable.\n\n***", "description": "De Lille's lead\u00adership style and her efforts to centralise power in her office sowed unhappiness and growing concern.
