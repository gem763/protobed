If you don\u2019t fire this prosecutor\u2019 \u2014 the prosecutor was after his son \u2014 then he said, \u2018If you fire the prosecutor, you\u2019ll be okay. And if you don\u2019t fire the prosecutor, we\u2019re not giving you $2 billion in loan guarantees,\u2019 or whatever he was supposed to give. Can you imagine if I did that?\u201d (Fox News interview)\n\nTrump and his allies \u2014 especially his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani \u2014 have been suggesting for weeks that Biden improperly used his influence as vice president to get Ukraine to sack its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016.\n\nThe Ukrainian prosecutor general\u2019s office had opened an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a natural gas company owned by an Ukrainian oligarch, Mykola Zlochevsky.\n\nHunter Biden, a lawyer and businessman, joined Burisma\u2019s board in April 2014 and left last month. The New York Times reported May 1 that he was \u201cpaid as much as $50,000 per month in some months for his work for the company.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden traveled to Ukraine in March 2016 (it was not a phone call, as Trump claimed) and said the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees (not $2 billion, as Trump claimed) unless Shokin was removed (it was not a demand to stop the Burisma prosecution, as Trump claimed, and there\u2019s no evidence Shokin \u201cwas after\u201d Hunter Biden).\n\nThe vice president\u2019s trip was part of a longer push by the United States, Western allies and nongovernmental organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The goal was to promote reform in Ukraine and remove a prosecutor who allegedly was turning a blind eye to corruption.\n\nThere\u2019s a dispute going on between Bloomberg and the Times over some aspects of this complex story. (Here\u2019s Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple on their back-and-forth.) One area of dispute is whether the Burisma probe was ongoing while Biden was pushing for Shokin\u2019s ouster. \u201cThere was no pressure from anyone from the U.S. to close cases against Zlochevsky,\u201d Vitaliy Kasko, a former official in the prosecutor general\u2019s office, told Bloomberg News in an article published May 7. \u201cIt was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.\u201d\n\nFor the purposes of fact checking Trump\u2019s statement, though, we note that neither news organization is asserting that Biden pushed to oust Shokin to get his son out of a jam.\n\nBloomberg reported that \u201cthe U.S. plan to push for Shokin\u2019s dismissal didn\u2019t initially come from Biden, but rather filtered up from officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation\u201d and that, in the same month Biden traveled to Ukraine, \u201chundreds of Ukrainians demonstrated outside President Petro Poroshenko\u2019s office demanding Shokin\u2019s resignation, and he was dismissed.\u201d\n\nThe current prosecutor general of Ukraine, Yuriy Lutsenko, was quoted in a May 16 report, also by Bloomberg, saying \u201che had no evidence of wrongdoing by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden or his son.\u201d\n\n\u201cHunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws \u2014 at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,\u201d Lutsenko told Bloomberg. \u201cA company can pay however much it wants to its board.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo evidence has surfaced that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing for the prosecutor general\u2019s dismissal,\u201d the Times reported. \u201cSome of his former associates, moreover, said Mr. Biden never did anything to deter other Obama administration officials who were pushing for the United States to support criminal investigations by Ukrainian and British authorities \u2014 and potentially to start its own investigation \u2014 into Burisma and its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, for possible money laundering and abuse of office.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for Hunter Biden told The Fact Checker that Hunter Biden never discussed Burisma or the investigations with Joe Biden. That\u2019s consistent with previous statements from the Biden camp.\n\nThe Biden campaign sent us an editorial published by Ukraine\u2019s Kyiv Post on May 17. It says: \u201cThe Biden narrative is too complicated to rehash here. But suffice it to say, it has been refuted by countless experts and anti-corruption activists. In 2016, Biden indeed pressured Ukraine to fire Viktor Shokin, its ineffective, weak prosecutor general. In doing so, he called for a decision supported both by Ukrainian reformers and Kyiv\u2019s Western partners. No conspiracy here.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is a separate question of whether Biden created the appearance of a conflict of interest with his Shokin-must-go campaign.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden has publicly stated that he pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to fire the state prosecutor, or possibly lose a billion dollar U.S. loan guarantee,\u201d a Trump campaign spokesman said. \u201cBiden\u2019s pressure on Ukraine\u2019s leadership came while his son, Hunter Biden, was on the board of Burisma.\u201d\n\nReferring to the Times article, the spokesman added: \u201cThere is reporting showing that an investigation by Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor into Burisma was ongoing while Joe Biden was engaged in his pressure campaign.\u201d\n\nInterviewer: \u201cDon\u2019t you think that should be investigated, that financial connection, the Chinese government putting billions of dollars into Biden\u2019s family business?\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201c100 percent. It\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d (Fox News interview)\n\nOnce again, we have Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, big sums of money and a foreign country. Except this time it\u2019s China, not Ukraine.\n\nWhat happened here?\n\nIn December 2013, Hunter Biden and one of his daughters flew from Japan to China with Joe Biden on Air Force Two. The vice president had diplomacy on his agenda. Days after the trip, Hunter Biden and a business partner had a new investment fund with backing from the Chinese government-owned Bank of China. What started as a $1 billion deal later grew to $1.5 billion, according to Peter Schweizer, a conservative author.\n\nAs the New York Times reported May 20:\n\nThe conservative author Peter Schweizer has suggested that Hunter Biden used the trip to secure a deal with the Bank of China \u2014 a suggestion that has been echoed by Mr. Trump\u2019s allies in the conservative news media. But a lawyer for Hunter Biden said he did not conduct any business related to the China investment fund on that trip, and was not an equity owner in the fund while his father was vice president. He later acquired a 10 percent interest in the entity that oversees the fund, but to date has not received any money from the arrangement, according to the lawyer.\n\nA lawyer for Hunter Biden told us the same: Hunter Biden did not conduct business related to the China investment fund during this 2013 trip, was not an equity owner in the fund while Joe Biden was vice president, later acquired a 10 percent interest in the entity overseeing the fund, and has not received money from the arrangement.\n\nWe asked Trump campaign officials what U.S. authorities could investigate if Hunter Biden did not conduct business related to the investment fund on this 2013 trip, did not have equity until after Joe Biden left office and has not made money from the deal.\n\nWe didn\u2019t get an answer to that, but a Trump campaign spokesman told us: \u201cThere is nothing to fact check here. The president was asked if Biden family-Chinese financial connections should be investigated, and the president said yes. As has been reported elsewhere, Hunter Biden has engaged in business dealings in China that raise some serious questions.\u201d\n\nTrump said this deal was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d worth investigation, so he\u2019s clearly insinuating wrongdoing.\n\nLooking at the facts publicly available, it seems more like smoke than fire to us. It\u2019s similar to how Ivanka Trump was granted Chinese trademarks days before and after President Trump vowed to save jobs at ZTE, a major Chinese telecom, in 2018. Or how Ivanka Trump was granted Chinese trademarks in 2017, on the same day she sat next to Chinese President Xi Jinping at a dinner.\n\n\u201cIn the eight years before my election, the United States lost a quarter of a million manufacturing jobs, but the great betrayal of the American worker ended on Day One \u2014 the day I took office \u2014 and you know that better than anyone.\u201d (Pennsylvania rally)\n\nThis Trump claim about manufacturing job losses suffers from multiple diseases.\n\nAlthough it isn\u2019t Biden-specific, \u201cthe eight years before my election\u201d is a clear reference to the Obama administration in which Biden served. (Trump later added that Biden \u201cdidn\u2019t take care of your jobs.\u201d)\n\nIn the eight years before Trump\u2019s election in November 2016, the United States actually lost a net 693,000 manufacturing jobs, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, not \u201ca quarter of a million.\u201d\n\nBut, as often happens with data, the picture can change drastically depending on where you set the baseline. In this case, Trump\u2019s baseline is November 2008, smack-dab in the middle of the longest U.S. recession since World War II.\n\nA close look at the numbers shows that most of the manufacturing job losses in the period Trump\u2019s talking about happened during the first year of Obama\u2019s administration, coinciding with the Great Recession that ended in June 2009. The bleeding did not extend throughout Obama\u2019s eight years in office.\n\nIn fact, the manufacturing sector began a slow but steady recovery in April 2010, during Obama\u2019s second year in office. That steady rate of growth has continued and accelerated under Trump.\n\nThe Trump campaign spokesman pointed out that 470,000 manufacturing jobs have been added during Trump\u2019s first 27 months in office, compared with 109,000 during Obama\u2019s last 25 months. During the course of the Obama administration, manufacturing job growth was basically flat \u2014 but there was a gain of more than 900,000 manufacturing jobs under Obama counting from April 2010.\n\n\u201cNo matter how you measure it, there is no disputing the U.S. economy lost hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs under President Obama,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re disputing. Trump\u2019s statement was false because it understated manufacturing job losses by more than 400,000. It was also misleading in two ways: It failed to mention the seismic effects of the Great Recession, which Obama inherited, and left out that manufacturing jobs increased for six-and-a-half of the eight years Trump mentioned.\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget Biden deserted you. He\u2019s not from Pennsylvania. I guess he was born here, but he left you, folks. He left you for another state. Remember that, please. I meant to say that. This guy talks about, \u2018I know Scranton,\u2019 \u2018I know\u2019 \u2014 well I know the places better. He left you for another state and he didn\u2019t take care of you because he didn\u2019t take care of your jobs. He let other countries come in and rip off America.\u201d (Pennsylvania rally)\n\nHow many fourth-graders are in charge of their family\u2019s destiny?\n\nBiden was born in Scranton, Pa., and speaks fondly of his family\u2019s ties to the area, which stretch to 1851.\n\n\u201cScranton is where my grandfather Ambrose Finnegan met and in 1909 married my grandmother Geraldine Blewitt. It\u2019s where my mother, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan, was born, and where she met and in 1941 married my father, Joseph Biden, Sr.,\u201d he told Ancestry.com in 2016. \u201cI lived in Scranton until I was in the fourth grade, but for the next 10-12 years, I spent most of my summers and holidays with the Finnegan family back in Scranton.\u201d\n\nTrump said Biden \u201cdeserted\u201d Pennsylvania \u2014 an outlandish claim, considering that Biden was either 10 or 11 years old in 1953, when his father moved the family to Wilmington, Del., out of financial necessity.\n\nHere\u2019s a New York Times article from 2008 describing the circumstances of the move:\n\nWhile Mr. Biden has described his early youth as stable and relatively carefree, his father suffered a number of business reversals, and for several years when Joe Jr. was young the Bidens were forced to move in with his mother\u2019s parents, the Finnegans, in their modest home on North Washington Avenue in Scranton. Though Scranton was sharing in the postwar economic boom, Joe Sr. had trouble finding steady work, and nothing that measured up to his previous success. For a time, he commuted to Wilmington to clean boilers for a heating and cooling company. In 1953, he moved the family there.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here that\u2019s factually incorrect,\u201d the Trump campaign spokesman said. \u201cAs everyone has pointed out (including Joe Biden) he and his family left the state. He subsequently built a life and entire career in Delaware, despite routinely calling himself \u2018Scranton Joe.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nTrump twisted a bunch of facts and left out a mountain of context in his remarks about the Burisma investigation and its connection to the Bidens.\n\nJoe Biden traveled to Ukraine in March 2016 (it was not a phone call) and said the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees (not $2 billion) unless Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general was removed from office. It was not a demand to stop the Burisma prosecution, as Trump claimed, and there\u2019s no evidence the prosecutor \u201cwas after\u201d Hunter Biden. The president made these comments days after the current prosecutor general in Ukraine said he had no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden.\n\nThe other three remarks are also misleading. Trump seems to be blaming the Obama administration for copious job losses in the manufacturing sector, while ignoring the impact of a historic recession (his statistics were off by more than 400,000 job losses to boot). There\u2019s no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden regarding the China trip in 2013, yet Trump still calls it a disgrace worth investigation, implying there was wrongdoing. His claim that Biden \u201cdeserted\u201d Pennsylvania, as a wee lad beholden to his family\u2019s fortunes, is nonsense.\n\nThe president got just enough right in each case to save himself from Four Pinocchios, but he still gets Three Pinocchios.\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles\n\nShare the Facts 2019-05-23 14:39:46 UTC Washington Post 2 1 5 Washington Post Rating: Three Pinocchios Washington Post Rating: \u201cLook at Joe Biden \u2026 he calls them [Ukrainian government leaders] and says, \u2018Don\u2019t you dare prosecute.
