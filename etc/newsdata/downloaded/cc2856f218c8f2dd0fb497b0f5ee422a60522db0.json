The survey was conducted Sept. 19-30.\n\nRead more: Emerging-Market Yield Hunt Will Trump Trade Wars for Now: Survey\n\n1. and trade war\n\nWith lingering U.S.-China trade tensions, is it more likely for the yuan to strengthen beyond 6.95 per dollar offshore or fall past 7.25 by the end of 2019?\n\nAlmost two-thirds of the survey respondents expect a further escalation in trade tensions, and a corresponding weakening in the yuan.\n\nRead here about potential emerging-currency reactions to any trade deal.\n\n2. China monetary easing\n\nWith increasing concerns about China\u2019s economic slowdown, do you expect concerted monetary policy easing from China by the end of 2019?\n\nOver three-quarters of survey participants expect concerted easing from the People\u2019s Bank of China. Authorities have so far refrained from large-scale stimulus, which could hinder their efforts to reduce financial leverage.\n\nInvestors see the PBOC\u2019s one-year medium lending facility rate, paid by commercial banks borrowing medium-term facilities from the central bank, to be trimmed to 3.1% by year-end from 3.3% currently, based on an average of 19 respondents. And the required reserve ratio for major banks, or the share of funds lenders must hold in reserve, will be reduced to 12% from 13%, according to the average of 25 respondents.\n\n3. Key Brazil reform\n\nWill Brazil pass the final vote on the pension bill before the year-end?\n\nThree-quarters of the survey participants expect Brazil\u2019s pension-reform bill to be approved this year, seen as a key move toward fiscal discipline in Latin America\u2019s largest economy. Upside to Brazilian bonds may be limited given the powerful rally they have seen in recent quarters, however, analysts say. Central bank rate cuts have also already boosted Brazilian debt.\n\nRead more here about the pension bill.\n\n4. Rating South Africa\n\nWill South Africa hold on to its sole investment-grade rating from Moody\u2019s in 2019?\n\nA majority of those surveyed expect the country to stay out of junk territory in the assessment of Moody\u2019s Investor Service. That\u2019s despite financial markets pricing in a downgrade for months. Both the S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings cut their assessments to junk in 2017.\n\nSeen as crucial to the judgment: South Africa\u2019s plan for troubled state-owned utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., which saw its stand-alone rating lowered deeper into junk by Fitch on Oct. 1. Underlying these fiscal issues are South Africa\u2019s growth concerns, with the economy having entered its 70th month of a weakening cycle in September.\n\n5. U.S. rate assumption\n\nWith U.S. rates having a strong bearing on emerging-market assets, is the more likely to rise above 2.4% or fall below 1.4% by the end of 2019?\n\nOver three-quarters of survey participants expect the benchmark to end the year lower than 1.57% as of 8:45 a.m. in Singapore, possibly below 1.40%. The yield has dropped more than a percentage point this year.\n\nEmerging-market debt has been a beneficiary of lower U.S. rates -- in particular, dollar-denominated bonds. The hard-currency debt has outperformed local-currency bonds so far this year, in part due to a strengthening dollar.", "description": "Whither the Yuan, Brazil Pensions?: Survey on Key EM Questions", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picc06cf4bf2101f1c08b2017a262286f67.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
