They suffer from higher rates of obesity, mental health issues, diabetes, cancer and opioid addiction, as my colleagues Stef Kight and Juliet Bartz reported.\n\nThey're also more likely to be uninsured or covered by Medicare or Medicaid, which pay doctors and hospitals less than private insurance does.\n\nA small and shrinking population, mostly covered by insurance plans that don't pay very much, many of whom need a lot of care, puts more financial pressure on providers, especially hospitals. Physician shortages are common.\n\nWhat they're saying: \u201cRural hospitals have long been right there on the edge on average, and we\u2019re seeing more and more of them flip over to red,\" said Mark Holmes, a professor at UNC-Chapel Hill and director of the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research.\n\nAnd hospital closures often exacerbate the problems communities were already facing.\n\nHospitals are often the largest or second-largest employer in a rural community.\n\n113 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, according to the Sheps Center.\n\nThese are disproportionately located in the South \u2014 the region with the nation's worst health outcomes, and where most states haven't expanded Medicaid \u2014 leaving hospitals with more uninsured patients.\n\nA 2018 study in Health Affairs found that Medicaid expansion is \"associated with improved hospital financial performance and substantially lower likelihoods of closure, especially in rural markets.\"\n\nThe bottom line: \"What we have here is not one root cause; there\u2019s multiple things going on here,\" Holmes said. \"All these sort of modest kind of trends are adding up to something that\u2019s quite considerable.\u201d\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "That makes rural Americans even more vulnerable.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/Avvqv-39lg1Scw4ugg0bbbOX0Ao=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/08/20/1566336088195.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-21"}
