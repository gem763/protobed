The samurai sword is famous for how many times it is forged and how many times it is sharpened.\n\n'It's the pursuit of perfection and excellence. We play with a great amount of skill, which the coaches have developed. It comes back to the level of detail that the samurai warrior would put into his sword and being a warrior.'\n\nLed by head coach Jamie Joseph, the squad created a 'Katsumoto score' which is judged on a series of performance metrics. Japan's players lack the size and weight of their opponents, but they have beaten teams by running them off their feet with skill, rapid recycling and pace.\n\nThe armoured Katsumoto model sits in the team room to connect the players to their history\n\nTheir formula has already seen them beat Ireland and Scotland, top their pool and reach the quarter-finals, warming the hearts of their typhoon-battered nation, and next they have South Africa in their sights.\n\n'There's a certain amount of resilience in how this country functions,' says Jones. 'We saw that on Sunday - people coming at 5am to get the stadium right for our game against Scotland.\n\n'On the rugby side, a lot of people are asking, \"What's the secret?\" There isn't one. We've just worked really hard on our fitness, held boys accountable - whether it's the youngest guy or Michael Leitch - and trained above how we expect to play.\n\n'That in itself takes a certain amount of resilience. Physicality is an area Japan maybe didn't focus on too much before. Your tackle count, the collisions, physical metrics all go into a Katsumoto score. The mindset relates back to the samurai.'\n\nSome of the players' work ethics come from a business background. Every club in Japan is backed by a company such as Toshiba, Panasonic and Yamaha.\n\nThe Japanese team pride themselves on their fitness and work incredibly hard in training\n\nThe players have been inspired by Katsumoto and are judged with a 'Katsumoto score'\n\nTraditionally, they have been employees first, sportsmen second. Players at Suntory Sungoliath, for instance, were often contracted as whisky salesmen.\n\nThese days, most are exclusively rugby players but Joseph revealed last week they are paid only $100-a-day with the national team.\n\n'The boys don't get paid to play for Japan,' says Jones. 'It's not where they make their money. What you see is a love for Japan and a love for wanting to achieve. All rugby players have that, but our guys don't have the monetary reward.'\n\nFitness plays an integral part. The foundations were laid by Eddie Jones, who pushed the players to breaking point, and the upward trajectory has continued.\n\nPlayers are also said to absorb information - with the analysts recently spending \u00a315,000 on two golf buggies installed with TVs so they can teach players on the move on the pitch. Most of Japan's players have been together in camp since February. 'The coaches build the style of play and from that we need to build the athlete,' adds Simon Jones.\n\n'The average ball-in-play time for a Test is between 32 and 34 minutes. We've tried to go 10 to 15 per cent above that with a 40-minute target. Our calculations are 39 to 40 minutes against Russia, Ireland and Scotland. A Test may last 100 minutes, so in training we squeezed 40 minutes ball-in-play time into 60 minutes.\n\nKenki Fukuoka scored twice for Japan against Scotland and their attacking play was sublime\n\n'To achieve that, there's a lot of emphasis on being as fit and strong as we can. That involves a lot of contact conditioning. We used wrestling coaches, jujitsu, and did a lot of contact, bashing each other up to build up some tolerance against injuries. In our final camp, we averaged just over 40km in five days.\n\n'A normal training week is 20km over seven days. We lifted heavy with deadlifts and squats. We ran a heap in training to exaggerate methods and had great direction from training. The Wattbike took the guys to some dark places.\n\n'Doing massive lactate sessions on the bike, where their legs are completely gone, then asking them to complete rugby sessions after that. You feel more like vomiting than playing rugby - and some guys did vomit.'\n\nIt is far from a 'zen retreat'. At their open gym session on Wednesday, the players pumped weights and blasted out tunes by Nitro Microphone Underground through a boom box. 'A lot of people say we're not that big but size isn't everything if you can be a great mover, more agile and more evasive,' says Jones. 'I'm not sure about raw weight, but strength to weight we're up there.'\n\nJones has noticed a unique trait about the Japanese. The wingers, Fukuoka and Matsushima, can accelerate over 10 metres in under 1.5sec and the players have impressive 'twitch' reactions. 'Even some of the big guys have a high level of twitch,' he says.\n\nThe Brave Blossoms are put through some incredibly taxing work in the gym\n\nJapan are massive underdogs against South Africa but they have already won admirers\n\n'They play a lot of cool Japanese hand-eye coordination games. There's a game called janken pon - like rock, paper, scissors. If you lose, you have to grab the scrum-cap and cover your head before the other guy hits you on the head with a plastic bottle. The speed they play is phenomenal!'\n\nBut above all, their success is underlined by a culture of respect. During Sunday's victory over Scotland, players would turn to bow if they were substituted.\n\nThey would acknowledge their team-mates and, after the final whistle, skipper Leitch even stopped to pick up litter.\n\n'Japanese culture has a vision of everyone being equal,' says Jones. 'Bowing when they come off the pitch is a sign of respect and a sign of thanks. Before they eat, they say itadaki masu, which is saying thanks for your food.\n\n'At the end of the day, everyone thanks one another for their contribution and their work and says otsukare sama desu.'\n\nNow Sunday's game against South Africa will provide the ultimate test.\n\n'People are saying we've stunned the world,' says Jones. 'We've always had this goal. It's awesome to achieve what we've targeted, but by no means are we surprising ourselves.'", "description": "NIK SIMON IN TOKYO - SPECIAL REPORT: Wherever the Brave Blossoms travel, a samurai warrior goes with them to serve as a reminder of what they set out to achieve.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/22/19808910-0-image-a-5_1571261842020.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
