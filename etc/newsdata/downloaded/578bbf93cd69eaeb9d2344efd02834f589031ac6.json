(AP) - Friel\u2019s legacy is not linked to huge success in wins and losses at UNH. Rather, it is tied to his long friendship with legendary Boston Celtics player Bob Cousy which spanned 50-plus years, his dedication to wife and family, and his steadfast commitment to his players\n\nDURHAM - Thoughts are turning to the late Gerard \u201cGerry\u201d Friel. A respected men\u2019s basketball coach at the University of New Hampshire, he passed away in 2007.\n\nThis fall marks the 50th anniversary of his first season in 1969-70.\n\nFriel\u2019s legacy is not linked to huge success in wins and losses at UNH, where he did what he did with limited resources for 20 seasons. Rather, it is tied to his long friendship with legendary Boston Celtics player Bob Cousy which spanned 50-plus years, his dedication to wife and family, and his steadfast commitment to his players.\n\nTwo of his sons, Keith and Greg, recently visited Cousy, now 91, at his home in Worcester, Mass., just days after Cousy received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Donald Trump.\n\nIt was a come-full-circle reunion. Gerry got his college coaching start with Cousy at Boston College in the late 1960s, and before that as a young boy he cut his basketball teeth at Cousy\u2019s Camp Graylag in Pittsfield, N.H.\n\n\u201cWe told a lot of Gerry Friel stories,\u201d laughs Cousy, who played 13 NBA seasons with the Boston Celtics, winning six championships. \u201cProbably a lot of them were exaggerated. We might have shed a few tears, too.\u201d\n\nGerry died young at age 64.\n\nCOUSY AND GERRY\n\nCousy recalls his first memory of Gerry in the early 1950s at age 8, his initial visit to Camp Graylag as a camper with his parents from their home in Oswego, New York.\n\n\u201cHe loved basketball,\u201d Cousy said. \u201cHe loved sports. He was full of energy.\u201d\n\nCousy remembers standing at the bottom of a hill with Gerry\u2019s parents while Gerry went up and changed into his sneakers.\n\n\u201cHe ran back down and right by us to the courts,\u201d Cousy said. \u201cHe was so anxious to get to the basketball courts. He didn\u2019t say goodbye to his parents. That was the kind of enthusiasm he had as a youngster.\u201d\n\nGerry eventually came back as a junior counselor, a counselor and then headed up the camp\u2019s athletic programs. By then Cousy was at Boston College as the coach, where he spent six seasons.\n\n\u201cWe reunited at Boston College and then he got the job at UNH,\u201d Cousy said. \u201cGerard was literally like a son to us.\u201d\n\nCousy said it was crystal clear as a youngster that Gerry had the skills for basketball. He later started coaching as a counselor. \u201cIt was obvious he had it in his blood,\u201d Cousy said.\n\nGerry joined Cousy\u2019s staff at BC in 1966. \u201cHe was like a breath of fresh air when I took him at BC,\u201d Cousy said. \u201cHe would anticipate just what you need as a head coach. You need people to do things that require doing before you ask them to do it. Gerard, maybe it was because we had been together for so long, he had that kind of presence.\u201d\n\nBC enjoyed great success in the three years Gerry and Cousy were together, going to the NCAA tournament twice and then the championship game of the National Invitational Tournament (NIT) that final season.\n\nCousy left BC to coach in the NBA, but not before recommending Gerry for the head job at New Hampshire.\n\nCousy doesn\u2019t recall the specifics, only that \u201cwe had done reasonably well at Boston College, so I had some juice at that time.\u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I did him a favor. New Hampshire then and now is kind of a basketball graveyard.\u201d\n\nUNH, JOAN AND THE KIDS\n\nDespite the obvious challenges, Gerry embraced his new job at UNH. After his first season ended in 1970, he met his wife, the former Joan Robie, then a senior at UNH.\n\nJoan laughs about their initial meetings, spurning him the first time he asked for a date. She had seen plenty of sports growing up, listing off football, soccer, wrestling and hockey. She mentions, however, she had never gone to a basketball game.\n\nJoan recalls his second attempt at dating her while she was walking near the intersection by Thompson Hall. \u201cHe pulls up in his Ford Torino convertible with white leather interior. He hops out in the middle of the intersection, leaves his car running and proceeds to ask me out again.\u201d\n\nShe did go out with him, although it was an odd jaunt to Suffolk Downs with Gerry and four friends, including Satch Sanders of the Boston Celtics. The wives of the other four were supposed to meet up with them at Suffolk Downs, but never showed.\n\nShe laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s how I met him, on the street. But he\u2019d been watching me since September. Keeping track, yes.\u201d\n\nThey were engaged later that year and married in 1971. They lived briefly in Barrington and then moved to Durham, buying a lot in the UNH faculty development for $1,800.\n\n\u201cGerry was making $10,000,\u201d Joan said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have $1,800, so we paid the university $100 a month.\u201d\n\nA friend of hockey coach Charlie Holt built their house for them, one they could afford, and they\u2019ve been there ever since (1975) on Croghan Lane in Durham.\n\nJoan recalls her first UNH basketball game with Gerry as coach during the 1970-71 season. It was at Bowdoin College in Maine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m engaged,\u201d she said. \u201cMary Rayhall (the wife of an assistant) and I are sitting in the stands with the freshman team. Gerry got thrown out of the game.\u201d\n\nThe thing was, as recounted by Joan, Gerry wouldn\u2019t stay in the locker room after he was tossed. Two state troopers had to be stationed at the door to prevent him from re-entering the gym.\n\n\u201cOn the way back home I\u2019m wondering what have I gotten myself into,\u201d Joan said. \u201cThe guy is crazy. He put on performances to rev the team up. He was just very enthusiastic.\u201d\n\nA Rhode Island fan section enjoyed Gerry\u2019s visits, cheering on his sideline antics. \u201cHe\u2019d throw his jacket, get on his knees, jump around, cartwheel,\u201d Joan said. \u201cYou can ask the players. He was a little bit crazy.\u201d\n\nAnother time years later, Joan recalls Jeremy, age 4, getting away from her during a game at UNH. \u201cHe\u2019s down there at Gerry\u2019s elbow, pulling his jacket, telling his dad to put a certain player in.\n\n\u201cGerry looks at him,\u201d she laughs. \u201cTurns around and looks at me. What can I do but shrug?\u201d\n\nJoan mentions that Gerry had a nervous stomach. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t eat before the game and really not after the game,\u201d she said. \u201c(The players) would vie to see who could sit next to him because that meant they not only got their meal but they got his as well.\u201d\n\nGerry coached, Joan worked, too, and their family grew. By the time his final coaching season rolled around in 1988-89, they had four children (Jennifer, Keith, Greg,and Jeremy). The fifth, Jilliane, was born in 1991. All five played basketball at the local public high school, Oyster River. All five scored more than 1,000 career points, and attended and played basketball at an NCAA Division I university.\n\nCoaching basketball was a passion for Gerry, but family was more important. He loved that his children could grow up in the Durham area.\n\nKeith and Greg recall being ball boys for their dad\u2019s team at a young age.\n\n\u201cKeith and I would do the halftime show,\u201d said Greg, who later played at Dartmouth College. \u201cWe\u2019d do our halfcourt hook shots and play one on one.\u201d\n\nKeith, who later played at Notre Dame and Virginia, said they went on close bus rides to Boston for games at Northeastern or Boston University. He particularly remembers the stacked Northeastern teams with Reggie Lewis in the mid 1980s. \u201cWe wanted to get out there and watch,\u201d Keith said. \u201cEverybody was talking about Reggie Lewis. I was excited to rebound for him and get out there.\u201d\n\nThe boys remember seeing the other schools and coaches like Jim Calhoun, Mike Jarvis, Tom Brennan, Skip Chappelle and John Calipari.\n\nJoan would pick the two boys up after school and drop them off at Gerry\u2019s practice at 3:30 p.m.\n\n\u201cWe quickly learned to hold onto the basketball when he was talking,\u201d Keith said. \u201cThat last shot when he said stop, you\u2019re running to grab it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got to hang with all the college kids when we were in elementary school,\u201d Greg said. \u201cWe\u2019d play horse, play pig.\u201d\n\nGerry opened basketball doors for his children with his connections and knowledge but, as Keith noted, \u201cHe wanted us to take ownership of our own game. That started at a young age.\u201d\n\nKeith felt he wasn\u2019t getting enough playing time with a sixth-grade travel team and told Gerry as much.\n\nKeith smiles, recalling the exchange. \u201cHe goes, \u2018So you think you should be playing more? Apparently it\u2019s not that evident to everybody else. Why don\u2019t you go talk to the coach. It obviously doesn\u2019t mean that much to you if you don\u2019t want to talk to the coach.\u201d\n\nBottom line, Gerry wasn\u2019t going to fight Keith\u2019s battles, especially involving playing time.\n\n\u201cAt the time, do I have a parent bail me out?\u201d Keith said. \u201c(My dad) didn\u2019t see a practice or a game, so now it\u2019s all on my account against someone else, a coach, who thinks you\u2019re not that much better. That struck me. I had no one else. It\u2019s in my hands. I\u2019ve got it. I\u2019m never going to be in that situation again. Great lesson.\u201d\n\nGerry wanted to expose his boys to the best competition, so he took the family to California and enrolled Keith and Greg at the prestigious Snow Valley Basketball School in Santa Barbara for a week.\n\nIt was a great, eye-opening experience for both boys.\n\nKeith recalls one morning they were offering optional big-man drills at 6 a.m. Gerry asked them if they were getting up for that.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Keith said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be big men.\u201d\n\nHe goes, \u201cYes, you are. You\u2019re going to learn to catch that ball down on the block. It was great for moving forward. Now I knew where my bigs wanted to catch it. It made a world of difference. Especially now, where everybody wants to specialize.\u201d\n\nBasketball was a year-round staple of the Friel household, even in the summer. For six to eight weeks, they would pack up the family car and head to Phillips Exeter Academy where Gerry ran a summer basketball school from his first year at UNH until the early 1990s.\n\nJoan recalls they at first lived in the dorms, and then once they had kids, they were given a house for the summer. They ate meals at the dining hall.\n\n\u201cWe loved going over there,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were swimming lessons at the pool. I loved their little library. Other families started to come, Dave Faucher\u2019s family.\u201d\n\nShe laughs. \u201cPeople would say \u2018How was your year?\u2019 Someone would say 11-16. You never had to say anything else. Because everybody knew - 18-10 or 2-15 or whatever. Nobody had to explain, hockey coaches or basketball coaches.\u201d\n\nJoan said she enjoyed it and the guys had a good time. \u201cThey\u2019d go out for a run in the morning after they\u2019d been up all night talking basketball, trying to figure out the ideal number for a basketball camp, which, by the way, is 96. But that came after a lot of alcohol and 20 years of working at Phillips Exeter.\u201d\n\nThey are fond memories for Joan. \u201cPeople go to Maine or the Cape for vacation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just went to Exeter.\u201d\n\nGerry\u2019s last season at UNH in 1988-89, the Wildcats nearly beat UMass on national TV. Greg remembers fans chanting \u201cGerry! Gerry! Gerry!\u201d after the loss on a buzzer-beating shot by UMass.\n\n\u201cHe was intense,\u201d Greg said. \u201cHe was competitive. There were no resources at UNH. No money.\u201d\n\nDave Faucher, who later was the head coach at Dartmouth College, agrees. Faucher, a Somersworth native, graduated from UNH in 1972. He credits Gerry with getting him into coaching. He served two years on Gerry\u2019s staff before coaching high school in Newmarket. He eventually joined the staff at Dartmouth where he became the head coach in 1991, a position he held for 13 years.\n\n?(The UNH) budget was not on par with other things,\u201d Faucher said. \u201cThere were a lot of things that were wrong with the school. That was wrong for the program not to be funded properly. He wasn\u2019t out recruiting as much as other schools, but he had contacts and he really used those to get players. There were a lot of disadvantages.\u201d\n\nAlthough he was hamstrung, Gerry made the very best of his situation. \u201cHe made it a good place to go,\u201d Faucher said. \u201cA good program for kids to play in. He coached with passion. He taught his players a lot. The proof is seeing his players come back.\u201d\n\nJoan was frustrated at times with how Gerry had to operate his program. \u201cHe was on the road a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cHe did more with so little. The other coaches in the league, the Yankee Conference, their budgets were so much better. They had two or three assistants. Gerry at one point had one full-time and one part time.\u201d\n\nGerry, as Joan notes, made $10,000 when he started at UNH. When he was done in 1989, she said he was making $38,000.\n\nShe recalls at some point the university giving Gerry a business American Express Card, which you had to pay off every month before you got reimbursed by the university.\n\n\u201cGerry didn\u2019t make much money,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if you take the drain of recruiting and putting that through the small family budget, that was a hardship for us financially, to be honest. If he didn\u2019t keep all his receipts, it was like us subsidizing the university.\u201d\n\nThere was, of course, an upside, according to Joan - he got players he really liked and cared about. \u201cYou see the quality of the kids that he got. Their families were impressed with the fact that Gerry was going to watch out for them for four years. Some of them were willing to pay in some way.\u201d\n\nJoan notes that UNH\u2019s standards for getting kids in was higher than other schools UNH played against. \u201cThey had to be smart and they had to want to come to New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nDespite the obvious disadvantages, there was still plenty of upside. Gerry\u2019s players were, truly, family.\n\nJoan recalls the university closing down for winter break and the players coming to their house for meals. She remembers one particularly bad snow storm. There was so much snow that Young\u2019s Restaurant, which fed the kids during the break, was closed.\n\nSo the players came to the Friel house for supper that night and for breakfast the next morning. \u201cRandy Kinzly loaded the dishwasher and someone else vacuumed after dinner and made sure everything was picked up,\u201d Joan said. \u201cThey would baby sit for us too and mow the lawn. We have fabulous, fabulous memories as I\u2019m sure the kids do, too.\u201d\n\nWhen Gerry was let go after the 1988-89 season with a career record of 189-335, he did not take it well.\n\n\u201cIt was tough,\u201d Joan said. \u201cBasketball really was his passion.\u201d\n\nLIFE AFTER COACHING\n\nShe encouraged him to look for another coaching job. \u201cI\u2019m an Army brat,\u201d Joan said. \u201cWe moved all the time. I knew it wouldn\u2019t kill the kids to move some place else. Family was very important to Gerry. He did not want to disrupt what we had with the kids and being in one place.\u201d\n\nInstead he took a job as Director of University Athletic Relations, and Director of Athletic Fundraising. Joan said he was good at his job, but he did not have the same appreciation or enjoyment of it as basketball.\n\n\u201cHe was a different person (after he got out of coaching),\u201d Keith said. \u201cHe was down. He was never diagnosed with depression. The fun-loving guy wasn\u2019t the same person anymore.\u201d\n\nLong after Gerry\u2019s career ended his legacy lives on. His kids used his wisdom and connections to play college basketball. His players respected what he had done for them and came back to show their appreciation.\n\n\u201cThe older guys come back and reach out,\u201d Greg said. \u201cA lot of those guys came to our games when we were in college. He created a real family atmosphere, which I don\u2019t think happens a lot these days.\u201d\n\nFamily.\n\n\u201cHe sacrificed his career for family,\u201d Keith said. \u201cHe was blessed in so many different ways when you look back.\u201d\n\nKeith, when he played, recalled time and time again people, officials, pulling him aside and asking about his old man.\n\nWhen Gerry was on the road, no matter where he was, at 9 p.m. he would leave whatever he was doing to call home and say goodnight to his children.\n\nGreg and Keith\u2019s recent visit with Bob Cousy was initiated by reconnecting with Greg\u2019s old pen pal - Bob Cousy - who he used to write to when he was much younger in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nOn March 21 he received this letter form the NBA Hall of Famer: \u201cDear Greg. So Pleased to hear that the Friel family is alive hopefully well. Your dad was always like a son to me. Hope you can decipher the scribbling. I\u2019m proud to announce that I\u2019m still computer illiterate. I had a wonderful BC event on March 9, 2019; honored the 67-68-69 teams. I was there in spirit. Health problems. But your dad\u2019s name along with Frank Power and Jack McGee were mentioned often. Have to keep this short as having energy issues. Hopefully a pacemaker in April will assist. If your mom is still alive, please give her a big hug for me. Bob Cousy.\u201d\n\nSo many memories of Gerry Friel from Cousy and others.\n\nFaucher recalls how he got into coaching through Gerry in the early 1970s. An undergrad at UNH, Faucher was taking a class with Gerry on coaching basketball.\n\n\u201cI was coaching youth basketball,\u201d he said. \u201cCousy was my favorite player. I read this book called \u2018Basketball Concepts and Techniques\u2019 by Cousy with Frank Power. Friel was Cousy\u2019s assistant. I read it.\u201d\n\nOne of the class assignments was to scout Gerry\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cWell his team ran a double stack, which was in Cousy\u2019s book,\u201d Faucher said. \u201cSo I knew all the terminology. Hit the wings. Screen away. High-low. Two-man game. All of it.\u201d\n\nFaucher saw UNH play and the following week in class, Gerry tells everyone what a great job they did with the scouting reports. He singled out one report \u201cthat\u2019s equal to any college coach in the country. I want to see that person after class.\u201d\n\nThat person was Dave Faucher.\n\nThey went to lunch and Gerry asked Faucher to join his staff as a volunteer assistant, going to practice and watching film.\n\nThe next year Faucher returned to the staff as the freshman coach. \u201cI loved it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a great opportunity. I\u2019ll never forget it because who knows what happens?\u201d\n\nJoan smiles when she speaks of her husband. \u201cHe learned to cook at 40 as soon as he stopped coaching. People loved to have him at weddings,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was a great dancer. He\u2019d dance with all the old ladies and anyone who didn\u2019t have a date.\u201d\n\nShe laughs at his \u201cold man quotes\u201d or Friel-isms, which her children repeat to this day.\n\nGreg likes using them and shared a few - Be quick, but don\u2019t hurry. If you fail to prepare, prepare to fail. Never panic, adjust. A good pass is one that gets there. Lots of hands make the load lighter, not later.\u201d\n\nHis favorite? \u201cIt\u2019s not the size of the dog in the fight. It\u2019s the size of the fight in the dog.\u201d\n\nGerry really cared about his players.\n\n\u201cHe had a nice impact on their lives because he was a gentleman,\u201d Joan said. \u201cHe insisted on manners. He expected them to work hard. He didn\u2019t put up with bad behavior. He expected them to go to class.\u201d\n\nDave Pemberton played for Gerry in the early 1970s and he told Joan, \u201cIt was the first time someone said he was smart and he could do anything he wanted to do with his college education. He had a lot of impact on people that way. At least that\u2019s what they tell me.\u201d\n\nGerry took his job and his players very seriously. \u201cHe felt very responsible for them,\u201d Joan said. \u201cAcademically, socially. He followed up. Graduation was very important to him. He had one of the best graduation rates.\u201d\n\nGerry Friel left his mark. Maybe not with the record, but he did what he could given the limitation of the resources at hand. More importantly he impacted many young lives by being a coach who was invested beyond the confines of the basketball court, beyond Xs and Os, beyond wins and losses.\n\nPretty good legacy.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2PscUYU\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Foster\u2019s Daily Democrat, http://www.fosters.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Friel's legacy is not linked to huge success in wins and losses at UNH.
