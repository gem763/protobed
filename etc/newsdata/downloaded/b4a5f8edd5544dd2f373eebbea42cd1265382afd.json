Eoh Kiy-ku explaining that volatility in crude oil prices were to blame for losses to energy companies.The government audit also focused on a recent series of energy storage system (ESS) fires across the country.DP lawmaker Lee Hoon expressed concern about battery systems manufactured by LG Chem, saying that LG\u2019s systems accounted for 54 percent, or 14 of the total 26 recently reported fires.A government investigation could not pinpoint a specific cause for the fires and instead blamed a wide range of reasons such as faulty management.The lawmaker said the 14 battery systems from LG were all an early batch manufactured in its plant in Nanjing, China, from the second quarter to the end of 2017.BY CHAE YUN-HWAN [chae.yunhwan@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
