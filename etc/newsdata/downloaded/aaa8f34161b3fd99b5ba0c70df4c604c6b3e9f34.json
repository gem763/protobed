He died in 2015 at the age of 40 after complications from a kidney disease.\n\nOne of those tries against England, when he gathered a loose pass, fended off opposite winger Tony Underwood, kept driving forward despite a desperate ankle tap from Will Carling and then barreled straight over the top of England fullback Mike Catt, is part of rugby folklore.\n\nCatt helped the coaching staff with the Italy team at the World Cup, where a group game between the Italians and New Zealand was cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis.\n\nHe recalled that \u201895 showdown for World Rugby, saying his first World Cup was going well until that moment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d beaten Australia the week before, won with a drop goal by Rob Andrew,\u201d Catt said. \u201cThen along came the big man and he ran over me. The three times after that, he just ran around me.\u201d\n\nThe All Blacks don\u2019t have a winger of Lomu\u2019s caliber in the 2019 squad, but they\u2019ve built a fearsome reputation with an unbeaten record dating to a shock quarterfinal loss to France in 2007.\n\nNew Zealand thumped Ireland 46-14 in the quarterfinals this year, deploying Richie Mo\u2019unga and Beauden Barrett in a dual playmaker system that proved to be a vastly better option than the strategy devised for the previous three meetings between those two countries. Ireland had won two of those three tests, including one last November, and was ranked No. 1 heading into the tournament.\n\nEngland equaled its record winning margin against Australia with a 40-16 win in Oita only hours earlier. Australia had contributed to England\u2019s group-stage exit in 2015, when it was hosting the tournament. But under Australian coach Eddie Jones, England has rebounded to win seven in a row against the Wallabies.\n\nEngland won a world record-equaling 18 straights tests from October 2015 to March 2017, matching the New Zealand mark from August 2015 to October 2016. Although England hasn\u2019t had that kind of success against New Zealand. The All Blacks have won 15 of the last 16 tests against England, including the last six, up to a 16-15 win at Twickenham last November.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a very good rugby side. They\u2019ve come to this tournament after being hurt at the last one and through that adversity, I think they\u2019re stronger because of it,\u201d All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said of England. \u201cThey\u2019re desperate and they\u2019re well coached. It\u2019s going to be a mighty clash. They\u2019ve got a harder edge about them.\u201d\n\nHansen said New Zealand\u2019s win in the last two encounters against England was not a bad thing, but not really an advantage at the World Cup.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be sounding rude or smart here, but we got told that about Ireland having an advantage over us having won two of the last three,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cHistory is important, but it doesn\u2019t dictate the future; it\u2019s a clean slate, it doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s happened in the past.\u201d\n\nJones has been busy trying to focus the attention on the All Blacks this week, continuing a theme of praise for opposition players and coaches while devising ways to bring them down.\n\n\u201cWe have a challenge this week because we are playing the greatest team that has ever been in sport,\u201d Jones was quoted as saying. \u201cIf you look at their record I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a team that comes close to them for sustainability.\n\n\u201cYou have to admire them, but then the challenge is to beat them and the reason I took this job is because I saw a team that could be great. That was the challenge and they are starting to believe it.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "One trampling run launched Jonah Lomu to global stardom, ensuring his name will be indelibly linked to a Rugby World Cup semifinal between New Zealand and England.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Pye"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
