Even her arrival into the world of athletics seems a fluke \u2013 only a bribe in the form of an ice-cream convinced the Perry Hall Primary School pupil to attend a running club where they ran cross country, a discipline she detested. It was her future coach John Blackie who saw her and put her on the right path, recruiting her to the Bees Academy in Bromley at the age of eight.\n\nPlay Video 0:56 'I never thought it would be me,' says Dina Asher-Smith after 200m world gold \u2013 video\n\nBy the time Asher-Smith left primary school and arrived at Newstead Wood School in Orpington, she was beginning to break records. However, for Vikki Eason, her PE teacher and athletics coach, it was Asher-Smith\u2019s overall athleticism that was striking.\n\n\u201cShe was always a really able sportswoman in many different sports, not just athletics; good at school games, she swam \u2026 I taught her as a PE teacher but also as athletics coach and she still used to come and compete for the athletics team.\u201d\n\nThe records continued. At 13, Asher-Smith recorded the 300m age\u2011best in a time of 39.16sec. Even as her athletics career took off and she began her long journey of juggling sport and academics, she continued to be an integral part of her school.\n\n\u201cThere was never any question [that she was committed to school],\u201d said Eason. \u201cShe took part in sports days and she represented the school at local athletics meets. She managed. She even went to primary school events and she did talks.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dina Asher-Smith shows off her 200m gold medal from the English Schools Championships in 2010.

Eason did not know that her pupil harboured Olympic goals until she watched Asher-Smith appear at the 2012 Olympic games as a kit carrier.\n\nAsher-Smith returned to school emboldened and inspired, finally ready to embrace her potential.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when she told me that she wanted to be an Olympian,\u201d says Eason. \u201cShe was so keen and so enthusiastic to be so close to the athletics stars. She was keen to take part in all aspects of athletics; she wasn\u2019t just one of the ones to perform and not do anything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cBubbly\u201d is the word constantly used to describe Asher-Smith, and that is also how Eason remembered her. But that does not quite explain how Asher-Smith has been so ruthless in the face of pressure in a sport that relies so heavily on mental fortitude. Early last year, Asher\u2011Smith gave a Tedx talk where she spoke only of her career, her mindset and goals. Her opening line revealed plenty:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Dina Asher-Smith and I am motivated by a fear of failure,\u201d she said. \u201cOK, \u2018motivated\u2019 isn\u2019t a strong enough word to express how I feel. It\u2019s more like an allergy to me \u2013 an itching, nagging feeling deep inside of me that gives me the inability to be complacent about anything.\u201d\n\nMost sporting champions are forged in the smothering heat of adversity and no season prepared Asher-Smith for this week more than the nightmare of 2017, when she fractured her foot in training five months before the 2017 world championships in London.\n\nEver since her Olympic experience, Asher-Smith had dreamed of London, so when doctors told her it was over, she refused to hear it. She worked tirelessly on her comeback and won a 4x100m relay silver after a fourth-place finish in the 200m. As well\u2011meaning people congratulated her simply on returning to the track, she realised that her attitude could not have diverged more.\n\n\u201cThe focus from then on was not just being healthy, not just running painlessly but it was being world class,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was being as close to my best as possible. So many people have told me: \u2018Oh my god, it\u2019s so good that you\u2019re running. You\u2019ve been so positive. It\u2019s great.\u2019 But I wasn\u2019t in the business of just being positive. I don\u2019t just go into the championships being positive. If I\u2019m there, I want to be the best I can be and London was no different.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Great Britain\u2019s Asha Philip (left), Desiree Henry, Dina Asher-Smith and Daryll Neita (right) celebrate winning silver in the women\u2019s 4x100m relay at the 2017 world championships in London. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nIn 2013, as a 17-year-old, she received a surprise call from British Athletics to run in the 4x100m team. She was shocked at that and even more so when the British quartet secured a bronze medal. Those days are no more. Now, she calls herself a \u201cchampionship performer\u201d, and after she won the 100m and 200m double at the European Championships last year, she returned home to pandemonium. She is learning how to be famous.\n\nDina Asher-Smith wins world 200m gold to make history for Great Britain Read more\n\n\u201cLots of people have been referring to me as a role model, which I still find very odd,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the same time I am rolling with it, because I do have a social responsibility to make sure young people have a positive person to look up to.\u201d\n\nWith a world title forever wed to her name and the Olympics on the horizon, there will only be more attention, more fame and more people looking up to her success as an example to emulate. But for all the fans she gains, it is telling that those who knew her first still back her all the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely amazing,\u201d Eason said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a real privilege to have taught her at school. For her to have worked with me and to now see her come through in the way she has? She\u2019s just worked so hard and she\u2019s so enthusiastic. It\u2019s really lovely.\u201d", "description": "Dina Asher-Smith began her athletics adventure aged eight and was later inspired by being a kit carrier at the London Olympics", "authors": ["Tumaini Carayol"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06b7b8ee8a729b55bf6d33b4c8daf112054af88e/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f4df6803388f8412169464da9d565f44"}
