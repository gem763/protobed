USA TODAY\n\nCHICAGO \u2013 The next major teacher strike in the U.S. \u2013 which could affect 35,000 public workers and about 400,000 students and their families \u2013 could disrupt life in the nation's third-largest city, starting Thursday.\n\nMembers of the Chicago Teachers Union are poised to strike after a failure to agree on a contract with Chicago Public Schools and Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Adding to the intensity: Members of the union that represents school support staff, as well as Chicago Park District workers, plan to walk out the same day \u2013 leaving the schools and the city's recreational facilities without many of the adults who could care for kids while teachers picket.\n\nThe Chicago strike would come on the heels of a wave of teacher protests around the country since early 2018. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nThe strike that started it all: How a West Virginia teacher\u2019s Facebook post started a national movement\n\nWhy did Chicago teachers vote to strike?\n\nThe union, which represents educators in the nation's third-largest school district, wants CPS and the mayor\u2019s office to commit to hiring more support staff \u2013 social workers, nurses, librarians. The union wants more specific limits on class sizes, which have swelled to the high 30s and mid-40s in some schools, teachers said. It's pushing for higher salaries for lower-wage workers such as school secretaries and classroom aides.\n\nTeachers want all of that in writing in their contract, not in the verbal commitments they've already gotten from the district.\n\nYvonne McNutt, 62, a social sciences teacher of 16 years, said people who aren't \"in the trenches\" may not understand the severity of understaffing and overcrowding in Chicago schools.\n\n\"I've had class sizes as large as 43 in my time teaching. That's not an easy struggle when you have to meet the needs of every child,\" said McNutt, who teaches at New Sullivan Elementary School in the South Chicago neighborhood. \"I'm standing up for my kids today.\"\n\nTeachers in America: No matter where they work or what they're paid, they feel disrespect\n\nThe youngest of five children raised by a single parent, McNutt said CPS gave her the tools to attain several degrees.\n\n\"Don't my children deserve the same thing that I was given?\" McNutt asked, tearing up. \"That's my question to the mayor, to any mayor in any city. Don't kids deserve the basics? I'm waiting for that answer, and I don't believe that they're hearing us.\"\n\nSupporters cheer at a rally at the Chicago Teachers Union headquarters on Sept. 24, 2019.

The teachers' union has contested that math, arguing that in five years, the average teacher would actually make closer to $85,000.\n\nThe city's offer includes raises for support staff such as classroom aides, but not as high as the unions want. It would require a bump in the contribution that teachers would make toward their benefits \u2013 but an increase that's less than what was recommended by an independent reviewer. The district promised not to privatize certain support staff positions and to provide relief for overcrowded classrooms.\n\nWill the two sides come to an agreement before Thursday?\n\n\u201cThe board is talking to us now about class sizes and staffing,\" union President Jesse Sharkey said at a news conference late Monday night. \"There\u2019s a lot of ground that we have to make up, and the hour\u2019s getting late.\"\n\nAs of 10:45 p.m. Monday, Lightfoot and CPS CEO Janice Jackson said in a joint statement that no measurable progress had been made on negotiations.\n\nWhy are Chicago teachers striking over support staff and class sizes?\n\nAt a rally and march Monday afternoon, hundreds of union members took to the streets, putting pressure on City Hall to strike a deal before Thursday.\n\nTyrone Hayes, 49, a security officer at John Marshall High School, has worked for CPS for 19 years. He said he hopes to see higher pay for bus aides, janitors and security officers, but the strike is driven by concern for students.\n\n\"It's not for the money \u2013 it's more for the kids,\" Hayes said.\n\nJesse McAdoo, 32, teaches a split first and second grade classroom. He said two of his students are supposed to have one-on-one assistants but do not.\n\n\"When I have 30 kids in the classroom, a lot of them 6- or 7-year-olds, 14 with IEPs (individual education plans to address their disabilities), it's very hard to give them my best when I'm playing whack-a-mole with trying to keep their attention,\" McAdoo said. \"Anybody that babysits kids, try babysitting five kids. I have multiples of that right now. It's a struggle.\"\n\nPresidential candidate U.S. Sen.

Several people have been shot near Difino's school in Lawndale.\n\n\"Those kids cannot come to school after seeing shootings and only have a nurse or social worker once a week,\u201d she said. \u201cThose schools need a social worker five days a week.\"\n\nDifino said she had no reservations about going on strike, but some teachers are more hesitant \u2013 even if they think it's the right step to take.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to strike, because I\u2019m really afraid of a break in instruction for our students,\u201d said Winnie Williams Hall, an eighth-grade special education teacher who works at a school of almost 500 students in Englewood, a high-poverty neighborhood. She said she lost her classroom aide this year.\n\nWhat do Chicago Public Schools leaders say?\n\nThat the offer is generous. And that they mean what they say \u2013 they don't need to put their commitments to hire more support staff in the teachers' contract.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s indisputably the richest and best offer in CTU history,\u201d said Michael Frisch, senior adviser and legal counsel to Lightfoot.\n\nLightfoot said the city and school district are working on behalf of children to get a deal inked before Thursday.\n\n\"All-in-all, our 72-page counteroffer provides more than 80 proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement on issues requested by the CTU. Everything we've put on the table is grounded in our fundamental respect for the dignity of teachers and school staff,\" Lightfoot said in a video message Monday morning.\n\nBoth the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times ran editorials encouraging teachers to take the deal, citing salary raises and concern for students who would miss class during the strike.\n\nTeachers, we hear you, we see you, and we remain committed to getting a deal done that respects your work. That is what educators, students, and families deserve. https://t.co/OxDoESFRYJpic.twitter.com/IF32NY0JOy \u2014 Mayor Lori Lightfoot (@chicagosmayor) October 14, 2019\n\nWhat's at stake as Chicago teachers weigh a strike?\n\nSharkey said this is the best opportunity the union has had in a generation to improve the quality of schools.\n\nUnlike many recent teacher strikes around the country, which have mainly brought renewed attention to low teacher pay, the potential Chicago teachers\u2019 strike is not centrally focused on educator salaries.\n\n'Can't pay their bills with love': In many teaching jobs, salaries can't cover teachers' rent\n\nUnion leaders are using this moment to press for more resources for underserved Chicago children \u2013 such as more wraparound services and even more affordable housing, considering about 17,000 CPS students are homeless, according to the teachers union. Historically, labor law confines unions to bargaining over pay and benefits.\n\nThe tactic of \"bargaining for the public good\" is gaining steam nationwide. It was on display this year when teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District went on strike. Teachers accepted the wage increase that had been negotiated before the walkout \u2013 a 6% raise \u2013 but they got management to agree to add nurses and librarians and to lower class sizes.\n\nStrikes, pay raises & charter protests: America's teachers have had an exhausting, exhilarating year\n\nCPS and mayor's office leaders have signaled they are sympathetic to the cause of teachers and the students they serve. Lightfoot campaigned on improving education in Chicago, a school system that predominantly serves low-income children who are black and brown. She endorsed some of the same issues that CTU has pushed for years. CEO Jackson has worked for years as a teacher and leader in Chicago's schools.\n\nIf Chicago teachers strike, where will students go?\n\nCPS leaders said that if a strike happens, all buildings will remain open and students can attend their normal school or any other school that's age-appropriate. They said administrators and principals will watch the students. District transportation will not be available. Regular instruction will not occur, but meals will be served in the school buildings.\n\n\u201cWe are urging CPS and CTU to do whatever it takes to avoid a strike \u2013 to stay at the negotiating table and hammer out all the issues,\u201d said Jennie Biggs, spokeswoman for Raise Your Hand, an education advocacy group that represents parents and community members in Chicago and Illinois. The group has maintained a strike resource page for Chicago parents.\n\nWill a strike get teachers what they want?\n\nTo be determined.\n\nAround the country, some teacher strikes have \"won\" by pressuring state legislatures to put more money into schools and, by extension, teacher pay. In others, the show of force and unity brought more resources to classrooms.\n\nThere could be other tangential benefits. In Los Angeles this year, the strike boosted morale in the union, and it helped to unify and publicize the union's pushback against charter schools.\n\nWill the public support a teachers strike in Chicago?\n\nAccording to a Chicago Sun-Times/ABC7 Chicago poll conducted by phone Friday and Saturday, 49% of voters either strongly or somewhat support a walkout, and 38% are opposed. About 35% say they would hold CPS or city officials responsible if a strike happens, and 12% say they would blame Lightfoot.\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot holds a press conference at City Hall in Chicago on May 31, 2019. (Photo: Ashlee Rezin, AP)\n\nWhen did Chicago teachers last strike?\n\nIn 2012. The mayor was Rahm Emanuel, who was combative with the union's leader, Karen Lewis. Teachers were upset over a new evaluation system. The district's budget was precarious. School closings were part of the discussion. The conditions now are much different.\n\nCTU almost went on strike in 2016, during negotiations on the mostly expired contract, but it agreed to a deal hours before the strike was to take place.\n\nCould CPS and CTU still avoid a strike?\n\nSharkey said negotiations would continue into Tuesday, but CTU would need to take a final vote Wednesday night on whether to accept the city's offer or strike.\n\n\"If something comes in writing at midnight on Wednesday ... that\u2019s just not possible,\" Sharkey said.\n\nEducation coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
