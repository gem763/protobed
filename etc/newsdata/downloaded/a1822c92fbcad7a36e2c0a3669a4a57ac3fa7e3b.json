For instance, this weekend, the 39-year-old singer shared an adorable snap on Instagram of herself holding her six-month-old daughter, Birdie, while wearing pajamas and no makeup, and she looks happier than ever.\n\nThe post in question features both Simpson and her daughter smiling in onesies with the caption, \"We just get each other \ud83d\ude0d #BIRDIEMAE.\" If it weren&apost for Birdie&aposs bright blue eyes, they would look like bonafide twins. Even so, the resemblance is uncanny \u2014 especially when Simpson is sporting a onesie and zero makeup. Even fans pointed out how much the mother-daughter duo look alike, as well as how young the singer looks without a full face beat. One commenter writes, \"Girl you look about 15 without makeup! #BLESSED.\" Another offers, \"I really thought she was maxidrew! Lol.\" (For those who don&apost know, Maxi Drew is Simpson&aposs eldest daughter.)\n\nOf course, countless folks also commented on how cute Birdie is, leaving comments like: \"She\u2019s precious,\" \"Look at those eyes \ud83d\ude0d,\" and \"I mean... come on.... that face \u2764\ufe0f.\" Now that she&aposs hit the six-month mark, Simpson has been sharing a ton of precious photos of Birdie, including one in which Maxi Drew is holding her like an amazing big sister.\n\nIt&aposs safe to say that fans are living for these priceless family moments from Simpson, so here&aposs hoping the singer continues to share them with the world.\n\nNow read more about Jessica Simpson:\n\nDone reading?
