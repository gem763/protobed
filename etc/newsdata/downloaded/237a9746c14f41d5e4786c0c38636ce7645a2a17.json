Exit polls show that Democratic presidential candidates have won a majority of voters who identify themselves as moderates\u2014as opposed to liberals or conservatives\u2014in every election since 1988. Put differently, Democrats have carried moderate voters in every election since Ronald Reagan left the scene.\n\nBut just prevailing among moderates isn\u2019t enough. To win nationally, history shows, Democrats need to win them decisively. In every presidential election Democrats won in that time span, they carried moderates by more than a dozen percentage points. In the elections they lost\u2014in 1988, 2000, 2004 and 2016\u2014they failed to carry moderates by such a margin.\n\nThat represents a cautionary note as the Democrats\u2019 liberal wing tugs at the large field of candidates angling to defeat President Trump in 2020. As a group, they are taking positions that would have been considered out of the mainstream just a few years ago, urged on by the party\u2019s energized progressive wing.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, who has pulled the party left over the past four years, continues to set the pace. He already has proposed free medical care, free college tuition, college debt forgiveness and a $16 trillion climate-change plan. Then, over the weekend, his campaign said he would be unveiling a plan for the federal government to pay off $81 billion in Americans\u2019 past-due medical debt.\n\nNot every Democrat is embracing the Sanders agenda, of course. But he isn\u2019t an outlier either; along with former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Sanders stands in the top tier of Democratic candidates.\n\nMeantime, the moderate ranks are thinning. Mr. Biden, who certainly is a moderate by today\u2019s standards, remains the leader of the Democratic pack, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar will join him on the debate stage later this month.\n\nBut other moderate voices are fading away: Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper has left the race to run for the Senate, and Sen. Michael Bennet, Rep. Tim Ryan, former Rep. John Delaney, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock \u2014all of whom argued for a more moderate agenda in the first two Democratic debates\u2014have failed to qualify for the next one.\n\nThat is just one sign that the primary-season energy is high on the left wing of the party this year. It is a dynamic that has some Democrats worried that the party has simply stopped talking to many of the moderate voters who again could prove critical in the general election.\n\nOne such Democrat is James Zogby, a longtime member of the Democratic National Committee and head of the National Democratic Ethnic Coordinating Council. That is a unit of the national party set up in the 1990s to reach out to the kinds of working-class ethnic groups\u2014such as Polish-Americans, Hungarian-Americans, Lebanese-Americans\u2014who long formed the backbone of both the working class and the Democratic Party. They are the personification of the moderate voters who have proven so crucial to Democratic success.\n\nMr. Zogby worries these traditional Democrats in the heart of the country aren\u2019t hearing from today\u2019s Democratic Party, focused as it is on millennials and coastal enclaves. \u201cPeople will call them everything,\u201d Mr. Zogby says. \u201cThey\u2019re white working-class, moderate, ethnic votes. They\u2019re swing voters, they\u2019re Reagan Democrats.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cWhen I speak to them they say we didn\u2019t leave the Democratic Party. They left us. They stopped talking to us.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, of course, did talk to them in 2016, and attracted enough of them in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin to win the White House, even while losing so many votes along the coast that he failed to win the national popular vote. A repeat is entirely possible, even though some of these moderate voters actually have been harmed by Trump trade policies.\n\n\u201cThese constituencies have been handed to Trump on a platter,\u201d Mr. Zogby says. \u201cHe gets them to vote against their own interest because he speaks to them.\u201d\n\nMr. Zogby views many of these voters as available to his party. They tend to be more mildly conservative on social issues than many other Democrats, he says, but embrace a progressive economic agenda: higher taxes on the wealthy, an expanded health-care safety net, robust consumer protections. \u201cMy feeling is that a carefully crafted approach to the social issues could create a majoritarian coalition.\u201d\n\nOne problem for Democrats, he adds, is that the national party\u2019s current culture isn\u2019t geared toward reaching such voters.\n\nIndeed, many Democrats think the 2020 election will be won simply by mobilizing the party\u2019s progressive base. History, though, suggests that is a risky proposition.\n\nWrite to Gerald F.
