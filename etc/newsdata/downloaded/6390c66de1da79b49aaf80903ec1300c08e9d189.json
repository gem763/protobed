What crazy things has she heard?\n\nThey didn't consider that it might actually be the case until a shock phone call came in: Michelle Obama was not only a listener but a fan. And she wanted to be a guest.\n\n\"Oh my God\u2026 What crazy things has she heard?\" Robinson recalls thinking at the time, in a rollicking interview with No Country For Young Women's Sadia Azmat and Monty Onanuga.\n\nBut the former First Lady of the United States would go on to provide Robinson not only with some stardust for her show - currently being turned into an HBO TV special - but an ongoing working relationship, a friendship and a whole lot of inspiration.\n\nAn interview with Obama would be an entirely appropriate curtain call for the final episode of 2 Dope Queens - and thereafter, Robinson would join her on stage during the book tour for Obama's bestselling memoir, Becoming.\n\n\"[It] was amazing!\" remembers Robinson. \"15,000 people turning up to hear two black women talking about a book? I loved seeing how people responded to her and her story.\"\n\nBut Obama's influence on the comedian, writer and actor would go far beyond specific collaborations. As Robinson worked with her, she observed how devoted this iconic woman was to \"being a public servant\" and lifting others up - and it's this that she now takes with her in her own life.\n\n\"She's influential in terms of living your life in an honest, giving way,\" Robinson says. \"We're all so concerned about our careers... it's take, take, take, gotta accomplish this. The awareness she has that life is more than accomplishing stuff on a to-do list, that's certainly huge.\"", "description": "Season 3 of No Country For Young Women sees Sadia and Monty talk to Phoebe Robinson", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07qj8q2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
