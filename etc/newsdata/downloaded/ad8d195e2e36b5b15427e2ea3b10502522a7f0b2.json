Dion, however, is making it very clear now she would rather he not follow through on that very specific form of homage. In an interview with iHeartRadio the singer offered Drake a series of things they can do together instead of him getting a permanent picture of her face on him. \u201cCan I tell you something: Don\u2019t do that,\u201d said Dion. \u201cYou can write me love letters, you can send me autographs for my kids, you can come and visit. I can have you home for lunch or dinner\u2026 we can go for a drink. We can sing together. Whatever you want to do. I can talk to your mother. Whatever you want, but please.\u201d\n\nAll of those options sound very good, and why get a tattoo of C\u00e9line Dion when you can have her call your mom instead? Open-minded woman that she is, though, Dion is not so concerned with the potential weirdness so much as she is the aesthetics and how her face will age on Drake\u2019s skin. \u201cThis is not the money maker over here first of all,\u201d Dion said, referring to her face. \u201cAs you go older \u2014 you too when the time comes \u2014 my face will go longer and it will go no prettier. So please don\u2019t tattoo it.\u201d Politely do what your legendary fellow Canadian asks of you, Drake.", "description": "C\u00e9line Dion does not want Drake to get a tattoo of her face, but she will totally have him over for dinner instead.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/12/19-celine-dion.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
