By outsourcing compensation to consumers, companies can pay their employees less. By controlling tips, consumers can tell themselves that they\u2019re shaping excellent service\u2014or connecting personally with a worker (\u201c\u2026 and this is a little something from me.\u201d)\n\nIn both cases, there is a tacit assumption that tipping \u201cworks\u201d because it makes service better and makes labor compensation more efficient. But a new paper using data from Uber rides comes to the stark conclusion that this assumption is wrong.\n\nTravis Kalanick, the founder and former chief executive of Uber, infamously hated the idea of allowing tipping on his app. Something about adding psychological \u201cfriction\u201d to the ride, reportedly. But John List, who served as chief economist at the company, disagreed. Drivers were so desperate for extra cash that many were busking for tips by hanging buckets on the back of their seats with signs begging riders to top off their meager income from driving. Talk about added friction.\n\nIn 2017, Kalanick was gone. Uber finally added a tipping function on the app. And List saw an opportunity to learn something profound about a behavior whose psychology had evaded other researchers. \u201cThe literature on tipping is replete with really nonconvincing studies with a paucity of data,\u201d List, who is now a professor at the University of Chicago and the chief economic adviser at Lyft, told me. \u201cI thought we could use the function on Uber as a nationwide field experiment to figure out some facts about how tipping really works.\u201d\n\nList analyzed 40 million UberX trips across the United States in August and September 2017, along with co-authors Bharat Chandar at Stanford University, Uri Gneezy, at UC San Diego, and Ian Muir, the head of economics at Lyft.\n\n\u201cThese findings slay the conventional wisdom about tipping,\u201d List told me. \u201cWe thought that if we added tipping, the quality of service might go up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it turns out, the quality of the service isn\u2019t very predictive of the tip.\u201d\n\nThe paper has three big conclusions. First, most people don\u2019t tip their drivers. Nearly 60 percent of Uber riders never leave a gratuity. Only 1 percent of people always tip.\n\nSecond, most tips have little to do with the driver. It\u2019s mostly about the rider. Men tip 23 percent more than women. Tips tend to be higher for airport and business trips, because people are generous when paying with other people's money\u2014especially when those people are the boss. Trips in small cities get higher tips. Same with early-morning and weekend-evening drives. In all, \u201crider-side effects\u201d\u2014the gender of the riders, where they were picked up, how long the trip was, and whether they were routine tippers\u2014explain three times more of the tipping variance than the qualities of the driver or the drive itself.", "description": "If you want to understand how meritocracy acts as a cover for inequality, look no further than our broken understanding of gratuity.", "authors": ["Derek Thompson", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19041521149923/facebook.jpg?1572114444", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
