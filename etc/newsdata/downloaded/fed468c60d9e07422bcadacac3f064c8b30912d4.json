As Latin America\u2019s No. 3 economy readies for the new government to come into power in December, what are the big looming questions for farmers?\n\nWILL HE HIKE TAXES?\n\nFarmers remember well the high taxes on overseas sales and export caps under Fernandez de Kirchner, who was in power before Macri moved to ease the burden on exporters.\n\nAlberto Fernandez, who is not related to the former president, is seen as likely to hike levies too to help raise tax incomes needed to trim the country\u2019s deficit and meet obligations under a funding agreement with the International Monetary Fund.\n\nInternational shipments of soybeans, along with oil and meal derivatives, are taxed at 18% plus 4 pesos per export dollar, which comes out to about 25%. Corn and wheat are hit at 4 pesos per export dollar, which amounts to about 7%.\n\nAny tax increase would be paid to the government by export companies. But it would be farmers who in effect pay the tax because the companies discount export taxes from the prices they pay to growers. So higher taxes would lower local crop prices, hitting farmers\u2019 incentives to plant and produce grains.\n\nDUAL EXCHANGE RATE\n\nWith currency controls currently in effect, Argentina could also adopt a twin exchange rate to ensure the farm and export sectors enjoy the competitive advantage of a weaker currency, while setting the exchange rate at a stronger level for other sectors to keep inflation in check.\n\nWith consumer prices rising at an annual rate of over 50% - and unlikely to come down fast anytime soon - farmers have raised the possibility of a dual exchange rate.\n\nDREADED EXPORT QUOTAS\n\nFernandez de Kirchner imposed strict quotas, or limits, on international corn and wheat shipments. The policy was meant to ensure ample domestic food supplies, but did little to keep prices under control.\n\nIndustry leaders said they did not think Fernandez would resurrect export quotas, because they would hinder his ability to bring in export dollars. But the question will remain until Fernandez makes his policies clear.\n\nFarmers say export quotas kill competition among buyers. As a consequence, wheat and corn sowing fell under Fernandez de Kirchner, while soy planting expanded rapidly, threatening to deplete soils because of the lack of crop rotation.\n\nWheat and corn planting increased after Macri took office in late 2015, while soy slightly rolled back.\n\nFOOD PRICE CONTROLS\n\nThe Peronists have tended historically toward more intervention in the economy than Macri, and could expand price controls on domestic foods to help the growing number of Argentines living in poverty.\n\nPopulist champion Fernandez de Kirchner used price agreements with retailers in her effort to control inflation during her presidency.", "description": "Argentina's farmers have some questions for President-elect Alberto Fernandez, after the center-left Peronist won a decisive election on Sunday, ousting business-friendly leader Mauricio Macri.", "authors": ["Hugh Bronstein", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
