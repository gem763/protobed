And he started with the \u201ccreepiest\u201d member of the White House team, Stephen Miller, who repeatedly refused to answer Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace\u2019s basic questions.\n\n\u201cDamn, Chris, be careful,\u201d Meyers said after playing the clip. \u201cIf you anger him too much, he\u2019ll sneak into your room at night, bite you on the neck and turn you into whatever he is, which I guess is a hairless cat?\u201d\n\nThen there was Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), who went on CNN\u2019s State of the Union to \u201crepeat a bunch of debunked conspiracy theories\u201d about Joe Biden, prompting Jake Tapper to tell him, \u201cIt\u2019s not gymnastics, it\u2019s facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun to see Jake Tapper tell an actual congressman, \u2018This isn\u2019t gymnastics,\u2019\u201d Meyers said before imitating Jordan: \u201cWhat? It isn\u2019t? I was about to tell a lie while doing a handstand on a pommel horse!\u201d\n\n\u201cSunday was filled with Republicans flailing in one interview after another because they have no convincing answers for the president\u2019s behavior,\u201d the host said, leading him to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who Meyers called \u201cby far my favorite dumb guy from the Sunday shows.\u201d\n\nAppearing on 60 Minutes, McCarthy attempted to catch reporter Scott Pelley in a trap when he quoted this line from the transcript of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you just added another word,\u201d McCarthy said confidently. But Pelley corrected him, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s in the White House transcript.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Meyers said in response. \u201cI love that his genius defense was \u2018you added a word.\u2019 And it wasn\u2019t even true. Also, which word in that sentence does he think, if you took it out, would suddenly make it OK?\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump and his allies can\u2019t defend their behavior because there is no defense,\u201d the host said. \u201cWhat happened here is very simple and obvious. The president asked for a quid pro quo, the White House tried to cover it up and they got caught. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a way, we\u2019re lucky that these guys are incompetent morons,\u201d Meyers added later, \u201cbecause now, rather than sticking together and coming up with a coherent and believable defense, they\u2019re all pointing fingers at each other and trying to blame one another for what happened with Ukraine.\u201d", "description": "\u201cTrump and his allies can\u2019t defend their behavior because there is no defense,\u201d the \u201cLate Night\u201d host said.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569904177/SM_50_l6lwtg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
