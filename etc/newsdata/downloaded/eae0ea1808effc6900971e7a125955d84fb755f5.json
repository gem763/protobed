(AP Photo/Frank Augstein)\n\nLONDON \u2014 When a giant fatberg was discovered in the sewer of a small coastal town in southwestern England last year, the company that manages the pipes was so mystified by the greasy mass of solidified fats and waste materials that it enlisted the help of scientists to discover what it was made of.\n\nThe grisly results of an autopsy were made public Friday, and they were not pretty, but held some surprises. Stuck within the massive, stomach-churning lump were wet wipes, as expected; oils; sanitary products; and even a set of false teeth.\n\nFatbergs are more commonly associated with large cities such as London and New York. Their contents can become a taxonomy of the habits of the inhabitants of nearby towns or cities.\n\nWhen a 140-ton fatberg was found in the East End of London in 2017, a subsequent autopsy revealed that the city\u2019s residents had been flushing condoms, syringes and narcotics \u2014 including cocaine and ketamine \u2014 down the toilet, and they were all lodged inside it.\n\nBut how a 210-foot-long fatberg could have festered for years underneath the picturesque seaside town of Sidmouth, England, more than 160 miles from London, presented a different puzzle to the company that manages the sewers in the area. Sidmouth, which counts only around 13,000 people as permanent residents, was not considered a prime fatberg target.\n\nSo before all trace of the fatty mass was destroyed, South West Water, the company that manages the sewers in Sidmouth and across 4,300 square miles of England, demanded answers.\n\nFour 22-pound lumps were taken from the beastly blockage and dispatched to scientists at the University of Exeter nearby for analysis.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to learn as much as we could about it, how it was created and what it was made of,\u201d Andrew Roantree, South West Water\u2019s director of wastewater, said in a statement.\n\nA team of 10 scientists welcomed the unusual challenge and carried out a dissection that involved melting down some parts of the fatberg, extracting and identifying the waste materials and even performing DNA sequencing.\n\nThe study was fascinating, John Love, a professor of synthetic biology at the University of Exeter and the project\u2019s leader, said in an interview Friday. But his team did not embrace all parts of the autopsy.\n\n\u201cIt was my first time analyzing a fatberg, and when you smell it, you think this is going to be the last time because the smell was honking,\u201d Love said. \u201cIt was awful to do, it smelled gross.\u201d\n\nHe explained that he and his colleagues wore stab-proof gloves and steel-capped shoes to protect themselves from any potential dangers within the samples. But after weeks analyzing Sidmouth\u2019s fatberg, the scientists realized they had nothing to fear.\n\nThe results found no dangerous bacteria or chemicals in the lumps, which were composed of domestic waste glued together by fats used in home cooking.\n\n\u201cWe were all rather surprised to find that this Sidmouth fatberg was simply a lump of fat aggregated with wet wipes, sanitary towels and other household products that really should be put in the bin and not down the toilet,\u201d Love said in the statement.\n\nBut, the experts discovered, just as the analysis of London\u2019s fatberg revealed some of its residents\u2019 illicit habits, the contents of Sidmouth\u2019s fatberg hinted at the town\u2019s population \u2014 or more accurately, the kind of things they threw away or lost.\n\nA set of false teeth was found within it. So, too, were a number of incontinence pads.\n\n\u201cSidmouth is a small coastal community that is largely populated by retired people, so in a sense that explains it,\u201d Love said. \u201cThis is not a hotbed of crime and drug-taking or anything like that,\u201d he added.\n\nLondon\u2019s Whitechapel fatberg was declared the biggest example in British history, and a piece taken from the 820-foot-long mass was put on display at the Museum of London last year.\n\nThe exhibition captured the imagination of the public, bumping up visitor numbers, and the museum acquired the remaining parts for its permanent collection, even setting up a live-stream video of a piece of a yellowing fatty lump.\n\nSidmouth\u2019s example, although it pales in comparison to its London equivalent, was the largest discovered in the service history of South West Water. A routine check in its sewers before Christmas last year revealed the fatberg longer than the Tower of Pisa lurking underneath the town\u2019s seafront road known as the Esplanade.", "description": "LONDON -- When a giant fatberg was discovered in the sewer of a small coastal town in southwestern England last year, the company that manages the pipes was so mystified by the greasy mass of solidified fats and waste materials that it enlisted the help of scientists to discover what it was made of.The", "authors": ["Anna Schaverien"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1SPUoQxQgICl9WhyHKGwIw--~B/aD0zNDY4O3c9NDgzNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/4d666e60-e796-11e9-8fbf-ff6e88b5694e", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
