It is unclear what Johnson intends to do but an election seems a likely outcome of whatever he decides.\n\nUnder the Fixed Terms Parliament Act, the government can call an early election but must it secure the support of two thirds of MPs.\n\nAn election can also be secured through a vote of no-confidence in the government, either brought by the leader of the opposition or by the government itself.\n\nThis process is a bit more tricky, as the act allows for a 14-day period to form a new government \u2013 although this has never been tested.\n\nThe earliest date for a poll is late November \u2013 possibly 28 November \u2013 as parliament has to be dissolved for 25 working days before a general election.\n\nAt this point, politicians stop being MPs and dedicate their attention to campaigning to be re-elected.\n\nParliament will be suspended until Monday, 14 October for a Queen\u2019s Speech, where the monarch will read out the government\u2019s new legislative programme.\n\nMPs traditionally debate the contents for several days and hold a vote, which would push the date of dissolution into the week of 21 October.\n\nThere could be some delay if the EU has to call an emergency summit to approve an extension.\n\nOver in Brussels, the general wisdom appears to be that an extension is likely to be discussed at the approaching summit.\n\nHowever there is uncertainty about what would happen if the UK has not requested a delay by that point.\n\nSome MPs may want to wait until after the Halloween Brexit deadline before triggering an election, to ensure that No 10 has not found a clever way to avoid asking for a delay.\n\nIf so, MPs would likely table a no-confidence vote on the next sitting day, which is Monday, 4 November, leaving the government to plan for a polling day around 12 December.\n\nOr MPs could wait until after Christmas to trigger an election, in a bid to avoid campaigning throughout the festive period.\n\nElections are rarely held during the winter months as turnout tends to be lower. The last election to be held in November was in 1935 and the last December poll was held in 1923.", "description": "With Brexit talks on the brink of collapse and relations between political parties sinking to new lows, the talk in Westminster\u00a0keeps returning to an early election.
