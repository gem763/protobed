The Houston Astros clinched their ticket to the ALCS. Here's everything you need to know heading into the league championship series. USA TODAY\n\nThere may have been a reason the Houston Astros were able to tee-off on Tampa Bay Rays starter Tyler Glasnow in the first inning.\n\nHe was tipping his pitches.\n\n\"I went back and looked and it was pretty obvious, as far as the tips go,\" admitted Glasnow after the 6-1 loss in Game 5 of the American League Division Series.\n\n\"I'm not going to say that's the reason why. I left some pitches over the middle of the plate and they're really good hitters and they can do things with it. I don't care how hard you throw to good hitters. I don't know if that's what it was, but when i look back, it was pretty obvious.\"\n\nHouston scored three runs before Glasnow recorded an out in the first inning. Then Yuli Gurriel extended the lead to 4-0 with another RBI single.\n\nThe Astros have a reputation for figuring out what pitchers are doing and taking advantage of it. But it's not an implication of them stealing signs, rather Houston batters being able to spot a pitchers tendencies early on and watching film of their previous starts.\n\nRays starter Tyler Glasnow gave up four earned runs in the first inning.

It was just a team approach today. It was just one at-bat after another.\"\n\nEither Glasnow is tipping his pitches or the Astros' first base coach can see the catcher's signs.\n\n\n\n\"If it's down, it's a curveball. If it's up, it's a fastball.\" -Alex Bregman#TakeItBackpic.twitter.com/twIcqPKaCt \u2014 Danny Vietti (@DannyVietti) October 10, 2019\n\nGlasnow, who finished the regular season with a 1.78 ERA over 12 starts, was chased after 2 \u2154 innings allowing five hits and four earned runs.\n\nThe Astros won the series and advanced to the American League Championship Series to face the New York Yankees.\n\nIn his postgame press conference, Rays manager Kevin Cash addressed the possibility of Glasnow's potential pitch tipping, but didn't think it was a major concern.\n\n\"Well, they could have been. We are aware at times with some pitchers, but at the end of the day it's 98 and it's a breaking ball. You've still got to do your job with it, and they certainly did.\"", "description": "Tampa Bay's right-hander gave up four runs in the first inning of Thursday's Game 5 loss to the Astros in the ALDS.", "authors": ["Scott Boeck", "Published A.M.
