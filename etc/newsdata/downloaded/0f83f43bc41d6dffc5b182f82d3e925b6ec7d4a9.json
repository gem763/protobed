Now fans mobilise on social media, picket the TV companies \u2013 and even go on hunger strike\n\nModern fandom can seem an alien concept. Gone are the teens penning heartfelt letters to their favourite pinups. Today\u2019s fans \u2013 or \u201cstans\u201d, named after the Eminem song about an obsessive stalker \u2013 are an online army ready to take on anyone that might threaten the object of their adoration. Most recently, fans of the cult Netflix show The OA have mounted a global campaign to have it reinstated after it was cancelled in August. Their tactics have taken fanaticism to the extreme: one demonstrator has even gone on hunger strike.\n\nFandom and TV have long gone hand-in-hand. The television fan movement was arguably born with the 1966 campaign to keep a little-known new series named Star Trek on air. After low ratings for the first two seasons, NBC was ready to relegate the show to the trashpile. Hearing the news, husband and wife Betty Jo and John Trimble organised one of the first grassroots fan campaigns, kicking off a letter-writing chain that amassed over 110,000 missives and which led to the renewal of the show.\n\nOther fans have been far more extreme. Post-apocalyptic show Jericho was cancelled by CBS after one season in 2006, prompting its stans to send 20 tons of nuts to the network\u2019s offices in protest. Inspired by a line from the final episode \u2013 predictably, \u201cnuts\u201d \u2013 the outpouring of nut-based feeling got the show one more season (albeit before it was axed again.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nuts! The campaign to save Jericho.\n\nSticking with the foodstuffs, sci-fi series Roswell was kept on-air for four seasons of plummeting ratings after fans bombarded its channel with bottles of Tabasco. As part of the \u201cRoswell is Hot\u201d petition, it is estimated that over 3,000 bottles of hot sauce were sent in total, until the campaign ran out of heat and the show was cancelled for good in 2002.\n\nWhen NBC threatened to axe high-school football drama Friday Night Lights in 2007, fans started sending streams of lightbulbs to their offices, as well as eye drops \u2013 a reference to the Dillon Panthers\u2019 motto: \u201cClear eyes, full hearts, can\u2019t lose.\u201d They saved the show for three more seasons. In 2018, the Adam Samberg-starring cop comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine was rescued from cancellation following a massive Twitter backlash centring around the hashtag #SaveB99. The same year, another Twitter campaign ensured a two-and-a-half hour marathon finale for the cancelled Wachowskis\u2019 sci-fi series Sense8.\n\nObscure tactics aside, what prompts such visceral reactions to these shows? For self-described \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine fanatic\u201d Jack Cartwright, it was much more than just an easy watch. \u201cIt might seem overblown to say this, but TV shows like Brooklyn Nine-Nine genuinely provide an escape from the often brutal day-to-day of work and responsibility,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen it was cancelled, I had to get involved to try and keep it on air.\u201d Cartwright, who is 27 and based in Leeds, turned to Twitter, regularly posting #SaveB99 and encouraging others to sign petitions to show the huge appetite for more.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The best fans in the world\u2019 ... Brooklyn Nine-Nine was saved after a massive backlash. Photograph: Fox/Getty\n\n\u201cWhen it got picked up by NBC, I was ecstatic,\u201d he says. \u201cIt shows that while places like Twitter can be a toxic online space, they can also be a community for real, positive change.\u201d Cartwright was joined in posting his support by celebrities like Lin-Manuel Miranda and Guillermo Del Toro \u2013 with Miranda eventually landing a guest spot on the renewed series. Showrunner Dan Goor responded to the campaign, calling them \u201cthe best fans in the world.\u201d\n\nFor fans of The OA, though, the future is still uncertain. Created by Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij in 2016, the sci-fi show centres around the reappearance of Prairie Johnson, a young blind woman missing for seven years who returns with her sight restored, now calling herself The OA. Cancelled after two seasons, the show built a dedicated following with many fans identifying with the diverse characters, including transgender Buck and disabled Dr Marlow Rhodes. When the cancellation was announced, \u201cdiscord groups\u201d sprung up to organise flash mob protests at Netflix offices and coordinate calls to the company, as well as fundraise $5,000 for a huge #SavetheOA billboard in New York\u2019s Times Square. The campaign has the feel of an insurgent political movement, yet it\u2019s all for a television programme.\n\ndestiny\u263d save The OA (@theOAagenda) THE BILLBOARD IS SO AMAZING\u2764\ufe0f IM SO PROUD OF US \u2728 #SaveTheOA #RenewTheOA @britmarling @z_al @netflix pic.twitter.com/iddRV7Ef62\n\n\u201cI had never been so moved by TV,\u201d fan and season-two OA writer Claire Kiechel says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know TV was able to do what The OA was doing \u2013 it thrilled my imagination, and gave me solace and hope at a time I had lost it.\u201d She believes the outpouring tapped into the deeper meaning the programme had for many. \u201cThe cancellation of a show which, for a lot of people had become a therapeutic totem or beacon of hope, can feel especially personal,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening with the Save the OA movement is a microcosm of what\u2019s happening in our larger society \u2013 the youth climate strikes, the calls for corporate social responsibility. We\u2019re all looking at the narratives we\u2019ve been living in and finding them lacking, and asking if we can come together for a better world. Stories matter and there is a moral responsibility that comes with telling them.\u201d\n\nThe responsibility is so marked that one OA fan, Emperial Young, decided to go on hunger strike outside Netflix\u2019s LA offices for a month \u2013 taking Sundays off \u2013 to protest her belief in its wider implications for society. \u201cIf nothing else I hope people can come away with the idea that art has an important place in the world,\u201d says Young. \u201cA lot of entertainment is feeding into the cycle of despondency, reinforcing the idea that we are powerless. The OA helps fight the hopelessness. Narrative can be a driving force that shapes reality.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It helps fight the hopelessness\u2019 ... The OA. Photograph: Nicola Goode/Netflix\n\nNonetheless, Netflix has been unresponsive to the protests, while creator Marling seems to have cryptically confirmed the end of the show with a lengthy Instagram post, saying how the fans\u2019 efforts have become its new driving force \u2013 something greater than the series itself. Perhaps this, not tons of nuts or light bulbs, is the legacy of fandom: creating communities beyond the shows they formed around.\n\n\u201cTV execs are losing out on a great opportunity \u2013 instead of seeing fandoms as enemies, they should collaborate with them,\u201d says Kiechel. \u201cRegardless of what happens with the show, I am lucky to be a part of this community and relearn what I knew as a child: art changes people. A story can give you the container, the metaphor, the name you\u2019ve been missing all your life.\u201d\n\nMcDonough is still helping to run the Save the OA campaign, mobilising their 1 million YouTube subscribers to fundraise and arrange flash mobs. Her message is clear: \u201cWe will keep going as long as it takes.\u201d", "description": "When Star Trek was due to be axed, they wrote letters in protest.
