He was forced out of his last start, Sept. 12 at Baltimore, in the first inning due to left knee discomfort. The plan was to have him pitch two innings and he responded well, other than walking consecutive batters with one out in the first.\n\n\u201cI want to pitch. I want to help this team in the postseason,\u201d Hill said. \u201cHopefully I can prove that I can help the team do that. That\u2019s the main goal, is October, and I believe today was a step in the right direction. I certainly want to continue going in the right direction on Sunday.\u201d\n\nManager Dave Roberts said Hill will start and go three innings in the season finale at the San Francisco Giants.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s encouraging that the door remains open,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cObviously the goal is to get him ready for the DS. He\u2019ll do a \u2018pen on the second or third day. It\u2019s open and that\u2019s a good thing for all of us. Richie, the training staff, they\u2019ve worked really hard to get him to this point, back, now we\u2019ve just got to hope it continues to get better each day and sustain itself.\u201d\n\nAfter he came out, Hill threw the equivalent of another inning in the bullpen.\n\n\u201cIt was a good day for us, for Richie,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nMuncy\u2019s 34th home run was a moon shot to right field on the first pitch by Gerardo Reyes with two outs in the fourth. Reyes came on after rookie Ronald Bola\u00f1os (0-2) walked Will Smith, allowed a single to reliever Tony Gonsolin and walked Joc Pederson.\n\nPederson hit his 33rd with one out in the ninth, off Michel Baez.\n\nGonsolin (4-2) pitched two perfect innings in relief of Hill, with three strikeouts. Kenley Jansen worked the ninth for his 31st save.\n\nThe Padres lost for the 10th time in 12 games. They were held hitless until the fifth, when they scored three runs on five hits against Dylan Floro. Luis Urias hit an RBI single and Manuel Margot hit an RBI triple and scored on a throwing error on the play by second baseman Gavin Lux.\n\nBola\u00f1os allowed four runs and three hits in 3 2/3 innings. He walked five and struck out four.\n\n\u201cHe put himself in a lot of problems,\u201d Padres interim manager Rod Barajas said. \u201cReally close to going four with only one run allowed, so he did put himself in a lot of problems, but he was able to make pitches. Unfortunately, too many pitches and the pitch count got ran up and that was it for him after he walked his fifth batter. Unfortunately, Reyes left the ball where Muncy could hit it.\u201d\n\nHEART & HUSTLE\n\nRookie shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr., who has been out since mid-August with a stress reaction in his lower back, received the Padres\u2018 Heart & Hustle Award as voted on by the MLB Players Alumni Association. Tatis received the award from first base coach Skip Schumaker, who was the Reds\u2019 winner in 2014. The overall winner will be announced in November.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDodgers: RHP Ross Stripling (4-4, 3.32 ERA) likely will start and pitch three innings Wednesday night. If he doesn\u2019t start, he\u2019ll be the bulk reliever.\n\nPadres: RHP Dinelson Lamet (3-5, 3.84 ERA) will face the Dodgers for the second time in his 14 starts this season. He is coming off a 14-strikeout performance in a 2-1 win last Wednesday in Milwaukee.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Rich Hill has every intention of making it back onto the Los Angeles Dodgers' playoff roster despite an injury-plagued season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bernie Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/dodgers_padres_baseball_91350_c0-189-4523-2826_s1770x1032.jpg?746f3e4b2f95864ce933e660a8e6774c3358b3d4", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
