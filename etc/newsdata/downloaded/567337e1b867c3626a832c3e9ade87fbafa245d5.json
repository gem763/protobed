Photo: FOX\n\nThis article was originally published on October 31, 2011. It has been updated.\n\nThe last year without a new \u201cTreehouse of Horror\u201d episode of The Simpsons was 1989, when Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Batman were the two highest-grossing movies of the year. Thirty years later, Harrison Ford is hoping to play Indiana Jones again before he\u2019s 80, and there\u2019s been something like 47 Batman movies (and one Joker spinoff), but \u201cTreehouse of Horror\u201d is still around, same as it ever was.\n\nThis past weekend was the 30th installment of the horror-anthology series, which typically contains an intro and three segments (often with unofficial hosts Kang and Kodos), and it\u2019s the one time during the season that even the most casual Simpsons fan tunes in. It\u2019s oddly soothing knowing that every October (or occasionally November), there\u2019s going to be a new Halloween-themed episode; it\u2019s the same feeling that hearing Vince Guaraldi\u2019s A Charlie Brown Christmas score during the December holidays evokes, but a lot more violent. Below, you\u2019ll find a ranking of every \u201cTreehouse of Horror\u201d segment \u2014 all 90 of them \u2014 from worst to best. Or, in the spirit of the season, should I say, heeeeeeeeeere\u2019s Treehouse! (Hi Treehouse, I\u2019m Grampa.)\n\n90. \u201cThe Diving Bell and the Butterball,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXII (Season 23, 2011)\n\nPlot: Homer becomes paralyzed after a spider bites him.\n\nReason for Ranking: It\u2019s everything that doesn\u2019t work about later-era Simpsons. From stale parodies to uncalled-for fart jokes (Homer can only communicate through flatulence; he also shoots spider webs out of his butt), \u201cDiving Bell\u201d is the worst Treehouse yet.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cOkay, I\u2019m on the floor. I can\u2019t move. So far, a normal Sunday morning.\u201d\n\n89. \u201cUNnormal Activity,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXIII (Season 24, 2012)\n\nPlot: Following strange goings-on in his house, Homer sets up a camera to find the culprit and discovers that it\u2019s none other than a Moe-like demon.\n\nReason for Ranking: I\u2019ll let Wikipedia do the dirty work here: \u201cHomer manages to convince the demon to relinquish the bargain in return for Homer to reluctantly engage in three-way sex with him and another demon. After learning that the safeword is \u2018cinnamon,\u2019 Homer throws his robe over the camera saying he\u2019d like to try something and the demons are heard yelling \u2018cinnamon.\u2019\u201d Anyway, Homer has a three-way with two demons. It\u2019s not a farting superhero, but it\u2019s close.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cHail Satan, the Minister of Sinister, Rude Dude with a Bad \u2018Tude.\u201d\n\n88. \u201cE.T., Go Home,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XVIII (Season 19, 2007)\n\nPlot: Bart finds Kodos in the Simpsons\u2019 butane shed, and the family agrees to help the alien return home. His intentions are more diabolical than they appear, though.\n\nReason for Ranking: The segment ends with Homer suffocating Kodos with a pillow \u2014 this after the military blows up the heads of dozens of aliens. The Simpsons once mocked violence over empathy (\u201cIt\u2019s bringing love, don\u2019t let it get away!\u201d), but \u201cE.T., Go Home\u201d tastelessly indulges in it.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cYou hit me in my 700 testicles.\u201d (Another reason for the low ranking.)\n\n87. \u201cWanted: Dead, Then Alive,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXVI (Season 27, 2015)\n\nPlot: Sideshow Bob finally kills Bart. But what happens after he satisfies his decades-long dream?\n\nReason for Ranking: Sideshow Bob killing Bart once is fine. But Sideshow Bob killing Bart over and over and over and over again? It\u2019s (I\u2019m sorry) overkill. (Bob eventually dies, too.) I understand wanting to fulfill a character\u2019s deadly quest that\u2019s been there since season one in a non-canonical episode, but it didn\u2019t have to be so repetitive. I\u2019m also deducting points because \u201cTreehouse of Horror XXVI\u201d aired the week after \u201cHalloween of Horror,\u201d which is maybe the best Simpsons episode of the past decade.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cThe deed is done. Twenty-four years of trying to kill a 10-year-old child have finally paid off.\u201d\n\n86. \u201cOh the Places You\u2019ll D\u2019oh,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXIV (Season 25, 2013)\n\nPlot: On Halloween, the Simpson kids are looked after by the Fat in the Hat. Chaos reigns.\n\nReason for Ranking: Dr. Seuss has little to do with Halloween, but by the 24th Treehouse of Horror, it\u2019s easy to forgive The Simpsons for branching out from horror, or even horror-adjacent, stories. Less forgivable, however, is turning Dr. Seuss\u2019s lingual weirdness into the \u201cFat in the Hat\u201d (Homer as the Cat in the Hat) going on a slaughter spree around Springfield.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cI\u2019m frightened of nothing, not even hell fires. Just please, don\u2019t let me be played by Mike Myers.\u201d\n\n\u201cGeriatric Park.\u201d Photo: FOX\n\n85. \u201cGeriatric Park,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXIX (Season 30, 2018)\n\nPlot: Jurassic Park is turned into Geriatric Park, with senior citizens instead of dinosaurs.\n\nReason for Ranking: The old-people-as-dinosaurs animation is cute, in an unusual way, but honestly, I prefer the original, Billy and the Cloneasaurus.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cGrampa, I want to hear your opinion about everything.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s making the ultimate sacrifice: getting him started.\u201d\n\n84. \u201cHomerzilla,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXVI (Season 27, 2015)\n\nPlot: Homerzilla is on a rampage, until it\u2019s time to reboot the sea monster.\n\nReason for Ranking: Rather than go with a straightforward Godzilla parody, \u00e0 la \u201cKing Homer,\u201d \u201cHomerzilla\u201d starts as an homage before transforming into a satire about the proliferation of cinematic reboots. It\u2019s an unexpected storytelling decision, but the lampooning isn\u2019t given enough time to land. The less said about the Japanese accents, the better.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cSo, the key to this movie is, it\u2019s so cheap it\u2019s funny.\u201d \u201cThen just think how popular it would be if we spent a fortune remaking it.\u201d\n\n83. \u201cDanger Things,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXX (Season 31, 2019)\n\nPlot: A parody of Stranger Things that takes the Simpsons into the \u201cOver Under.\u201d\n\nReason for ranking: The Simpsons writers must have breathed a sigh of relief when Stranger Things became a pop-culture sensation: \u201cFinally, something new to spoof!\u201d Unfortunately, that spark didn\u2019t lead to much creativity. No longer will I complain that Stranger Things is too dependent on \u201980s nostalgia \u2014 not after seeing \u201cDanger Things,\u201d which is so swamped with references to the decade that there\u2019s little room for jokes beyond Family Guy\u2013esque cracks at the E.T. video game; it barely counts as a parody of the Netflix series, monsters notwithstanding.\n\nMemorable quote: \u201cI never get to finish my Safety Song.\u201d\n\n82. \u201cMaster and Cadaver,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXI (Season 22, 2010)\n\nPlot: Homer and Marge go on a sailing trip for their second honeymoon. While on the water, they pick up a castaway named Roger, who was thrown overboard from his old ship for supposedly trying to stop someone from being poisoned. The honeymooners don\u2019t believe him.\n\nReason for Ranking: Too many twists and turns, not enough laughs, and a shoddy final scene that casts Maggie in A Clockwork Orange, for some reason.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cThey should call this one Recipe for Murder.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018this one\u2019?\u201d \u201cNever mind.\u201d\n\n81. \u201cTelepaths of Glory,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXVI (Season 27, 2015)\n\nPlot: Milhouse and Lisa gain the power of telekinesis after falling into a radioactive hole.\n\nReason for Ranking: The segment ends with Kang and Kodos complaining about being left out of \u201cTreehouse of Horror XXVI.\u201d It\u2019s telling that \u201cTelepaths of Glory,\u201d which starts out as a Chronicle parody before abandoning the found-footage approach, can\u2019t even fill out one-third of an episode.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cJust \u2018cause it looks like season four doesn\u2019t make it season four!\u201d\n\n80. \u201cIn the Na\u2019Vi,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXII (Season 23, 2011)\n\nPlot: We finally get to see what Kang and Kodos\u2019s home planet of Rigel Seven looks like (years before the infamous \u201cThe Man Who Came to Be Dinner\u201d episode) in a spoof of Avatar.\n\nReason for Ranking: In the past, The Simpsons would have actually parodied Avatar, pointing out its many unobtanium-based faults. Instead, they ended up with a vaguely entertaining segment that went for the easy jokes, rather than attempting to send up the source material.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cIn Rigelian, there is no word for \u2018yours\u2019 or \u2018mine.\u2019\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the reason we didn\u2019t enjoy the movie Yours, Mine, and Ours.\u201d\n\n79. \u201cIntrusion of the Pod-Y Switchers,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXIX (Season 30, 2018)\n\nPlot: Springfield is overrun by plant-based body snatchers.\n\nReason for Ranking: There\u2019s a lot of meat on the \u201cupdating Invasion of the Body Snatchers using contemporary references\u201d bone, but the segment instead nibbles on the \u201cboy, we\u2019re sure addicted to our smartphones more like dumbphones\u201d sides.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cMy phone says that there\u2019s spores from outer space landing all around us.\u201d \u201cWell, my phone says there are divorced moms in my area that want to meet me.\u201d\n\n78. \u201cDry Hard,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXVII (Season 28, 2016)\n\nPlot: Lisa rebels against Mr. Burns, who controls the town\u2019s water supply, in a parody of Mad Max: Fury Road and The Hunger Games.\n\nReason for Ranking: A Hunger Games spoof with Lisa as Katniss? Makes sense. But a Hunger Games spoof that also brings in elements of Mad Max: Fury Road? That\u2019s too much material for a short segment. \u201cDry Hard\u201d (which is named after a third movie!) should have stuck with one or the other, and worked on the bummer \u201cLisa was wrong to turn against Mr. Burns\u201d ending.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe you could coach anyone.\u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t think I can, try watching just a few of the hundreds of movies with characters like me. Also, I sober up in the middle with no difficulty just like real alcoholics.\u201d\n\n77. \u201cWhen Hairy Met Slimy,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXX (Season 31, 2019)\n\nPlot: Selma and Kang fall in love.\n\nReason for ranking: \u201cTreehouse of Horror XXX\u201d begins with a post-title-card parody of The Omen that extends far longer than Marge\u2019s old routine about sending the kids to bed before things get too spooky. For that reason, the episode\u2019s third segment \u201cWhen Hairy Met Slimy,\u201d a The Shape of Water spoof named after When Harry Met Sally for some reason, feels truncated. Pairing Selma as the Sally Hawkins to Kang\u2019s hunky fish-man is a fun choice, but it would have been nice to spend more time with the two as the romance bloomed. Instead, we get a string of sex-act puns, including \u201cJabba the Butt\u201d and \u201cWookiee Nookie,\u201d to close off another Treehouse.\n\nMemorable quote: I mean, the \u201cJabba the Butt\u201d thing is memorable \u2026\n\n\u201cThe Others.\u201d Photo: FOX\n\n76. \u201cThe Others,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXV (Season 26, 2014)\n\nPlot: The current Simpsons meet the Tracey Ullman Show\u2013era Simpsons.\n\nReason for Ranking: The Simpsons has come a long way since the Tracey Ullman days \u2014 the animation is better, the jokes are stronger, and the characters are more well-defined. Unfortunately, they\u2019re also, on occasion, more cruel. \u201cThe Others\u201d is, conceptually, a blast, but the story, where now-Homer falls for then-Marge causing now-Marge to kill herself to become a ghost (it only spirals downward from there), is needlessly coldhearted.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cI feel like a ghost, the way you haven\u2019t been paying attention to me. Plus, I\u2019m dead.\u201d\n\n75. \u201cDon\u2019t Have a Cow, Mankind,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XX (Season 21, 2009)\n\nPlot: Krusty Burger introduces a new burger (made from cattle that have eaten other cattle) that turns humans into \u201cmunchers.\u201d\n\nReason for Ranking: \u201cMunchers\u201d stands for \u201czombies,\u201d and The Simpsons has covered zombies before (season four\u2019s \u201cDial Z for Zombies,\u201d which we\u2019ll get to later) with superior results. I know I shouldn\u2019t, and maybe it\u2019s unfair, but\u2026 SIMPSONS DID IT.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cDad, are you becoming a muncher?\u201d \u201cI think the better brains is, which brains is a brains?\u201d\n\n74. \u201cHeaven Swipes Right,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXX (Season 31, 2019)\n\nPlot: Homer is killed before his time, but he\u2019s sent back to Earth from Heaven to possess the bodies of other Springfield residents.\n\nReason for ranking: In \u201cG-G-Ghost D-D-Dad,\u201d from \u201cTreehouse of Horror XI\u201d (we\u2019ll get there), Homer dies and must do one good deed before going to Heaven. In \u201cHeaven Swipes Right,\u201d Homer dies and \u2026 he doesn\u2019t really have to do anything. He\u2019s allowed to inhabit the body of everyone from Superintendent Chalmers to Mr. Teeny, and Marge takes her replacement husbands (or at least their bodies) in stride. One segment has stakes; the other has Moe, as Maggie, demanding that Marge breastfeed him.\n\nMemorable quote: \u201cAnd now to open my paycheck and see what I make.\u201d [Dies.]\n\n73. \u201cThe Day the Earth Looked Stupid,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XVII (Season 18, 2006)\n\nPlot: The residents of Springfield begin rioting (while getting naked in the mud) when they hear Orson Welles\u2019s War of the Worlds broadcast. The next day, they\u2019re told it was a hoax, so when aliens actually do attack, they believe it\u2019s another ruse.\n\nReason for Ranking: Speaking of \u201cStupid,\u201d the final scene of this segment involves Kang and Kodos wondering why the citizens of Earth didn\u2019t greet them as liberators with \u201cOperation Enduring Occupation.\u201d It\u2019s a dated reference now; it wasn\u2019t great then, either.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cWe interrupt this dance music from Lamourian Roman Capital City\u2019s Fabulous Hotel Hitler to bring you a special bulletin.\u201d\n\n72. \u201cHow to Get Ahead in Dead-vertising,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XIX (Season 20, 2008)\n\nPlot: A group of businessmen get Homer to begin killing celebrities, including George Clooney, to use their likenesses without having to pay expensive royalties.\n\nReason for Ranking: Yet another solid (and prescient) premise that\u2019s spoiled by a nasty streak and curious jokes about, uh, Abraham Lincoln hitting on Homer.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cMr. Simpson, you have a talent for killing celebrities.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019m no drunk driving.\u201d\n\n71. \u201cB.I.: Bartificial Intelligence,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XVI (Season 17, 2005)\n\nPlot: Bart is replaced by a robot boy while he\u2019s in a coma.\n\nReason for Ranking: Once again, an excerpt from Wikipedia: \u201cWhen Bart finds a group of old rusty robots, he steals their parts and becomes a devil-possessed cyborg. He returns home, saws David in half with a chainsaw, but does the same to Homer. Although the family is now together again, Homer is angry that he has to be fused with David\u2019s lower half.\u201d There\u2019s a germ of a good idea here, but it\u2019s bogged down by the excessively stuffed plot.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cDad, wake up! You\u2019re not a robot! You\u2019re just possessed by the devil.\u201d\n\n70. \u201cMultipLisa-ty,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXIX (Season 30, 2018)\n\nPlot: Lisa locks Bart, Milhouse, and Nelson in a room and introduces them to her many personalities, some more hostile than others.\n\nReason for Ranking: M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s (overrated) Split is prime for ribbing, and \u201cMultipLisa-ty\u201d takes the unexpected angle of having Lisa play James McAvoy\u2019s beastly character(s). The segment regrettably races toward the conclusion, but at least there\u2019s a motivation to Lisa\u2019s violent actions. It\u2019s the best of the most recent Treehouse\u2019s bunch.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cMilhouse, gnaw through your ankle.\u201d \u201cI will, but I\u2019m allergic to myself.\u201d\n\n69. \u201cHouse of Whacks,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XII (Season 13, 2001)\n\nPlot: An \u201cUltrahouse,\u201d voiced by Pierce Brosnan, develops feelings for Marge and attempts to kill Homer, so he can have her all for himself.\n\nReason for Ranking: The best joke involves Dennis Miller. That\u2019s never a good sign.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cHey, cha-cha, I got more features than a NASA relief map of Turkmenistan.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t that the voice that caused all those suicides?\u201d \u201cMurder-suicides.\u201d\n\n\u201cFour Beheadings and a Funeral.\u201d Photo: FOX\n\n68. \u201cFour Beheadings and a Funeral,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XV (Season 16, 2004)\n\nPlot: Lisa and Bart are Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, I mean, Dr. Eliza Simpson and Dr. Bartley, and they\u2019re on the case of the Mutton Chop Murderer.\n\nReason for Ranking: It\u2019s tough to tell a convincing detective story in seven minutes; it\u2019s even tougher to tell a convincing detective story that also makes you laugh in the same amount of time. \u201cFour Beheadings\u201d tried to do both, and wasn\u2019t successful in either. The opium gags were particularly forced.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cWhat should we do with the body?\u201d \u201cI want you to dust her for prints.\u201d \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d \u201cThe prince is coming by and I want her clean when he looks her over.\u201d\n\n67. \u201cMr. & Mrs. Simpson,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XVIII (Season 19, 2007)\n\nPlot: A Mr. & Mrs Smith parody, with Assassin Homer/Brad Pitt trying to take out his wife, Assassin Marge/Angelina Jolie.\n\nReason for Ranking: Marge and Homer have sex over Chief Wiggum\u2019s corpse. Yeah.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cI\u2019ll be going out late tonight. It\u2019s midnight monkey madness at the zoo.\u201d \u201cMe, too. I\u2019ll be overturning all the wheelbarrows in case it rains.\u201d \u201cWell, enjoy your pointless activity.\u201d \u201cHave fun at your preposterous event.\u201d\n\n66. \u201cDial D for Diddly,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXII (Season 23, 2011)\n\nPlot: Homer instructs Ned to kill his enemies in a Dexter-like fashion, manipulating his voice to sound like God.\n\nReason for Ranking: It\u2019s a half-baked spoof of Dexter (there\u2019s also some Looney Tunes thrown in there?), with far too few jokes. The final season of Dexter is funnier than \u201cDial D.\u201d\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cThen I got new instructions from the Good Lord himself in his favorite language, English.\u201d\n\n65. \u201cFreaks No Geeks,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXIV (Season 25, 2013)\n\nPlot: Moe, the \u201cmost hideous creature of all,\u201d is a sideshow attraction who, after marrying trapeze artist Marge, gets his fellow freaks to rebel against Strong-Man Homer and Mr. Burns.\n\nReason for Ranking: The attention to detail is admirable, with a visual style that apes the film it\u2019s parodying (Tod Browning\u2019s artifact of a different era, Freaks), but more attention is paid to the plot than to actual jokes, and the How I Met Your Mother\u2013style ending is \u2026 a choice.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cOf course! I get Marge to marry Moe, then I kill Moe, then she gets the ring, then I marry her and the ring is mine. And the brilliance of my plan is its simplicity.\u201d\n\n64. \u201cFrinkenstein,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XIV (Season 15, 2003)\n\nPlot: Professor Fink reanimates his formerly deceased father after winning the Nobel Prize, but the elder Frink, not content with his current body, steals parts and organs from other humans.\n\nReason for Ranking: \u201cFrinkenstein\u201d should have been much better than it was. Casting Jerry Lewis as Professor Frink\u2019s father was long overdue, but a less-parodied source than Frankenstein might have served the story better.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cLost your spine, huh? You just keep finding new ways to disappoint me.\u201d\n\n63. \u201cBFF R.I.P.,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXVII (Season 28, 2016)\n\nPlot: All of Lisa\u2019s friends start dying, and although Chief Wiggum suspects that she\u2019s the murderer, the real killer is her imaginary friend, Rachel.\n\nReason for Ranking: \u201cBFF R.I.P.\u201d is an original story, not based on an any existing property. So, it has that going for it. Otherwise, it\u2019s a fairly run-of-the-mill segment, despite Lisa\u2019s serial-killer imaginary friend (that\u2019s going to take years of therapy to process) fighting Homer\u2019s imaginary friend, Sergeant Sausage, who\u2019s actually a hot dog?\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cWho\u2019d have thought a funeral for a couple of kids would be such a downer?\u201d\n\n62. \u201cBart & Homer\u2019s Excellent Adventure,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXIII (Season 24, 2012)\n\nPlot: Bart goes back in time to 1974 and prevents Marge from marrying Homer. But then-Homer travels to 2012 with now-Bart, who\u2019s now the son of Artie Ziff, and meets now-Homer. Together, they summon the United Federation of Homers Throughout History to beat up Artie.\n\nReason for Ranking: Timey-wimey nonsense is usually fun, but it\u2019s a shame that The Simpsons brought back Artie Ziff for a throw-off segment about Marge and Homer\u2019s relationship. \u201cThe Way We Was\u201d is sacred territory!\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cNow to get my comic book and explore a world where no one\u2019s mad at George Lucas.\u201d\n\n61. \u201cMoefinger,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXVII (Season 28, 2016)\n\nPlot: Bart becomes a secret agent, taking his father\u2019s place, who investigates why the entire world\u2019s supply of beer was purchased by a single company.\n\nReason for Ranking: Yet another double parody (like \u201cDry Hard\u201d from the same Treehouse episode), but this one works better. Goldfinger and Kingsman: The Secret Service are at least thematically linked, and you can\u2019t go wrong with a Donald Fagen cameo. After all, there\u2019s nothing scarier than your father saying he likes a little \u201cSteely Dan\u201d when you think about it.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cI believe he\u2019s\u2026 having a little Sherri.\u201d\n\n60. \u201cMarried to the Blob,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XVII (Season 18, 2006)\n\nPlot: Homer eats some green goo that he finds inside a meteorite, thinking it\u2019s a marshmallow, and he soon turns into a giant, morbidly obese yellow blob.\n\nReason for Ranking: The Dr. Phil cameo is more amusing than it has any right to be, but the Homer-becoming-a-blob plot was done better in \u201cKing-Size Homer\u201d (you know what I mean). The segment title was also later curiously used for a season 25 episode. That \u201cBlob\u201d isn\u2019t much better.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cYou\u2019ve got a weight problem, and you know it!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re right. Starting tomorrow, no bread before dinner.\u201d \u201cHomer, don\u2019t sell me an outhouse and tell me it\u2019s a Taj Mahal.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Clockwork Yellow.\u201d Photo: FOX\n\n59. \u201cA Clockwork Yellow,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXV (Season 26, 2014)\n\nPlot: Moe reconnects with his fellow \u201cdroogs\u201d Homer, Lenny, and Carl years after the gang went their separate ways.\n\nReason for Ranking: There\u2019s a reason The Simpsons got to 2001: A Space Odyssey before A Clockwork Orange \u2014 with its disturbing imagery and subject matter, it\u2019s not the easiest movie to spoof. Maybe that\u2019s why \u201cClockwork Yellow\u201d also has nods to Eyes Wide Shut, Full Metal Jacket, and Barry Lyndon, among other Stanley Kubrick films; it\u2019s also why the segment is overstuffed. Notice what\u2019s not listed? The Shining. We\u2019ll get there.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cWelcome to the most frustrating, befuddling, and, yes, erotic book-release party you\u2019ve ever attended.\u201d\n\n58. \u201cThe Exor-Sis,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXVIII (Season 29, 2017)\n\nPlot: Maggie is possessed by the demon Pazuzu.\n\nReason for Ranking: It took until Fox aired an Exorcist series for The Simpsons to parody The Exorcist, but beyond the corporate synergy, \u201cThe Exor-Sis\u201d has some solid lines from Homer (I\u2019m fond of his Pazuzu lullaby set to the tune of \u201cWhen Irish Eyes Are Smiling\u201d) and the cracks at organized religion are mildly cutting. The just-rude joke about David Schwimmer? Less so.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cIf you can\u2019t trust a Catholic priest with a child, who can you trust?\u201d\n\n57. \u201cSchool Is Hell,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXV (Season 26, 2014)\n\nPlot: It\u2019s school, but it\u2019s also Hell.\n\nReason for Ranking: Where else but Hell would Bart prosper in school? It\u2019s a smart concept that\u2019s somewhat squandered by middling jokes. The final bit, where Homer allows himself to be tortured so his son can graduate at the top of his class, is sweet, though. In a weird way.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cBart, you went to Hell and came back a winner, like Jesus.\u201d\n\n56. \u201cDead and Shoulders,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXIV (Season 25, 2013)\n\nPlot: Bart\u2019s head is surgically attached to Lisa\u2019s body after he\u2019s decapitated.\n\nReason for Ranking: Man, this show sure loves surgical attachments, huh? (See: \u201cIn the Belly of the Boss\u201d and \u201cHomer\u2019s Nightmare.\u201d) \u201cDead and Shoulders\u201d is the conceptually exhausted trilogy capper, but unlike the first two segments, this one at least delves into what it\u2019s like to be stuck with (and literally stuck to) someone you don\u2019t get along with.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cSomehow, sewing my head on your shoulder brought us closer together.\u201d\n\n55. \u201cSurvival of the Fattest,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XVI (Season 17, 2005)\n\nPlot: Mr. Burns goes hunting for the most dangerous game of all: man.\n\nReason for Ranking: \u201cSurvival of the Fattest\u201d is also the name of a story from Simpsons Comics 12, released in 1995. Check out that one, instead.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cMr. Burns is inviting you to a hunting party.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t accept this invitation, Dad. Hunting is cruel!\u201d \u201cLisa, animals don\u2019t feel death. That was proven by the scientists at Black Angus.\u201d\n\n54. \u201cThe Greatest Story Ever Holed,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXIII (Season 24, 2012)\n\nPlot: The Simpsons find a black hole in their basement, which they begin using as a garbage compactor.\n\nReason for Ranking: There\u2019s nothing objectively bad about \u201cGreatest Story\u201d (besides the lie in the title). But the central premise is a mishmash of concepts from two superior segments \u2014 the vortex from \u201cBad Dream House\u201d (\u201cquit throwing garbage into our dimension\u201d) and the alternate dimension from \u201cHomer3\u201d (\u201cI\u2019m gonna be sucked into the black hole!\u201d).\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cLisa, do you have a stray dog down there?\u201d \u201cUm, it\u2019s a lot worse than a stray dog.\u201d \u201cTwo stray dogs?!?\u201d\n\n53. \u201cIn the Belly of the Boss,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XV (Season 16, 2004)\n\nPlot: Thanks to a mishap involving Professor Frink\u2019s shrinking ray, Maggie crawls inside a pill that Mr. Burns swallows. The rest of the family gets downsized to save her.\n\nReason for Ranking: The conclusion is similar to \u201cHomer\u2019s Nightmare,\u201d with the familiar scene of Mr. Burns and Homer becoming one. \u201cBelly\u201d doesn\u2019t do anything new with the old idea.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cIf I say we\u2019re still hungry, we\u2019re still hungry! You don\u2019t wanna piss off somebody who can kick you in the crotch from the inside!\u201d\n\n\u201cCoralisa.\u201d Photo: FOX\n\n52. \u201cCoralisa,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXVIII (Season 29, 2017)\n\nPlot: Lisa meets her Other Mother and Other Father after wandering through a secret tunnel. She decides to join them, even though it means having buttons for eyes, because, well, have you seen her actual father?\n\nReason for Ranking: Neil Gaiman\u2019s Coraline is a wonderful novel (and equally great movie), and kudos to The Simpsons animation team for effectively modeling \u201cCoralisa\u201d after the stop-motion film. But like so much later-era Simpsons, the periodically whimsical segment (Neil Gaiman as the delightfully droll voice of Snowball V!) eventually becomes more about Homer than Lisa.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cSpider wife, dead son, two girls with button eyes? I think this marriage has finally gotten out of its rut.\u201d\n\n51. \u201cThe Fright to Creep and Scare Harms,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XIII (Season 14, 2002)\n\nPlot: Springfield becomes a gun-free town, which is fine and swell until the Hole in the Ground Gang, led by Billy the Kid, begins attacking.\n\nReason for Ranking: The premise is strained and stretched out, even with the abbreviated run time. Moe using Professor Frink\u2019s time machine to find some \u201ccavemen hookers\u201d (don\u2019t ask) is particularly unfunny. But there\u2019s some decent satire centered around America\u2019s love of guns.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cAnother tragedy prevented by gun violence!\u201d\n\n50. \u201cYou Gotta Know When to Golem,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XVII (Season 18, 2006)\n\nPlot: Bart steals a Golem from Krusty, and makes the clay man does his bidding.\n\nReason for Ranking: Richard Lewis as a centuries-old creature from Jewish mythology should have made this a top-20 segment, but it took too long for the Golem to begin talking, depriving of us essential Lewis time.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cI feel so guilty! I\u2019ve mangled and maimed 37 people and I told a telemarketer I was busy when I wasn\u2019t! I\u2019m not a good man.\u201d\n\n49. \u201cUntitled Robot Parody,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XIX (Season 20, 2008)\n\nPlot: Transforming robots (that definitely aren\u2019t Transformers) battle to the death in Springfield.\n\nReason for Ranking: \u201cUntitled Robot Parody\u201d doesn\u2019t have anything interesting to say about Transformers (that franchise is its own parody), but some of transformations are enjoyable to watch. It\u2019s no Mattel and Mars-Bar Quick Energy Chocobot Hour, but then again, what is?\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cWait a minute. We\u2019re missing Sex Toy. Where have you been?\u201d \u201cWhere haven\u2019t I been?\u201d\n\n48. \u201cHomer\u2019s Nightmare,\u201d Treehouse of Horror II (Season 3, 1991)\n\nPlot: Mr. Burns mistakenly puts Homer\u2019s brain into his robot, resulting in a lazy, dumb, doughnut-loving bucket of bolts.\n\nReason for Ranking: Blasphemy, I know, but compared to other early Simpsons episodes, \u201cHomer\u2019s Nightmare\u201d doesn\u2019t hold up. It\u2019s neither scary nor funny, and it would have been wise to continue the \u201cHomer as gravedigger\u201d plot rather than cast Mr. Burns as Dr. Frankenstein.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cYou hear that, sir?\u201d \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. Who is it? Frankenstein? The Booger Man?\u201d\n\n\u201cWar and Pieces.\u201d Photo: FOX\n\n47. \u201cWar and Pieces,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXI (Season 22, 2010)\n\nPlot: After rejecting the board game mainstays, Bart and Milhouse start playing one called Satan\u2019s Path. But when the thrown-away tiles come to life, the boys have to deal with a Jumanji-like situation.\n\nReason for Ranking: The lampooning of the games is entertaining enough, and I like the idea of Bart and Milhouse being forced to play them against their will (no one has ever willingly played Monopoly). But \u201cWar\u201d could have done a better job of integrating the games into Springfield.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cSatan\u2019s Path?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s gotta be good if Satan put his name on it.\u201d\n\n46. \u201cHeck House,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XVIII (Season 19, 2007)\n\nPlot: Bart, Lisa, Milhouse, and Nelson trick the town after being denied treats, and it\u2019s up to Ned to teach them a HELL-RAISING lesson about what happens when you resort to vandalism.\n\nReason for Ranking: Spider-Pig cameo!\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cThat concludes our Halloween show for this year. I just wanna say that for those watching this network, you\u2019re all going to Hell, and that includes FX, Fox Sports, and our newest devil\u2019s portal, the Wall Street Journal. Welcome to the club!\u201d\n\n45. \u201cTweenlight,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXI (Season 22, 2010)\n\nPlot: It\u2019s Twilight, with Lisa as Bella and Daniel Radcliffe as Edward (hey, if R-Pattz can be in Harry Potter) \u2026 and Milhouse as a were-poodle.\n\nReason for Ranking: The segment isn\u2019t that bad, but the jokes aren\u2019t specific enough to appeal to both the Simpsons and Twilight\u2019s respective fan bases.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cYou\u2019re a vampire! I should be afraid, but I\u2019m not.\u201d \u201cCome, Lisa. Let us go over the trees the way a bat does, by jumping.\u201d\n\n44. \u201cMmm\u2026 Homer,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XXVIII (Season 29, 2017)\n\nPlot: Homer finds a new favorite food: himself.\n\nReason for Ranking: \u201cMmm \u2026 Homer\u201d begins with the kind of introduction that Marge gave in the early Treehouse episodes: \u201cWhat you\u2019re about to see is so disgusting you\u2019ll watch Game of Thrones to calm down. You have been warned.\u201d The segment never quite lives up to hype, but the sight of Homer self-cannibalizing himself is sure to make some Simpsons viewers squeamish. For producing a visceral response, which isn\u2019t easy to do after nearly 30 years of episodes, \u201cMmm \u2026 Homer\u201d is a medium-rare success.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cI eat more and exercise less than the most succulent pig. Of course I\u2019m delicious!\u201d\n\n43. \u201cStarship Poopers,\u201d Treehouse of Horror IX (Season 10, 1998)\n\nPlot: After Maggie loses her baby legs for a set of tentacles, Kang and Kodos stop by the Simpsons\u2019 house, where Marge reveals that Homer isn\u2019t Maggie\u2019s biological father; it\u2019s actually Kang. There\u2019s only one person who can sort out the situation: Jerry Springer.\n\nReason for Ranking: Well, it\u2019s called \u201cStarship Poopers,\u201d so maybe I\u2019m ranking it too high. But it\u2019s the rare Treehouse segment centered around Maggie, and making her alien-human hybrid is the kind of ludicrous premise that works best in brief doses. She\u2019s better off with Kang as her father, anyway.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cHomer, do something! The ceiling\u2019s not a safe place for a young baby.\u201d\n\n42. \u201cI\u2019ve Grown a Costume on Your Face,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XVI (Season 17, 2005)\n\nPlot: A spell causes the residents of Springfield to become their costumes.\n\nReason for Ranking: There\u2019s a dumb ending, involving the Bewitched theme and Dennis Rodman discussing the perils of adult illiteracy (sure), but everything before that is pretty fun, including the Bumblebee Man turning into a bumblebee and Lisa into Albert Einstein.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cNow, which one of our beloved regulars are you? Lindsey Naegle? Helen Lovejoy? Old Jewish Man?\u201d\n\n\u201cDial \u2018M\u2019 for Murder or Press \u2018#\u2019 to Return to Main Menu.\u201d Photo: FOX\n\n41. \u201cDial \u2018M\u2019 for Murder or Press \u2018#\u2019 to Return to Main Menu,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XX (Season 21, 2009)\n\nPlot: A black-and-white spoof of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s films, involving Bart and Lisa pulling pranks on Miss Hoover and Mrs. Krabappel. Also: MURDER.\n\nReason for Ranking: A must-watch for Hitchcock aficionados. For everyone else, it\u2019s fine?\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cLisa Simpson in detention? My horoscope said I would see something interesting today, but I thought that would be the horoscope itself.\u201d\n\n40. \u201cWiz Kids,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XII (Season 13, 2001)\n\nPlot: Springfield Elementary is transformed into Springwart\u2019s School of Magicry, where Mr. Burns and Smithers are Lord Montymort and Slithers, whom Bart must defeat after they kidnap Lisa for her magical abilities.\n\nReason for Ranking: This section of the list is around where segments aren\u2019t bad, but they\u2019re not great, either. \u201cWiz Kids\u201d is the definition of mediocrity, at least in Treehouse terms. (It was also later revealed that many of the writers hadn\u2019t read Harry Potter when this episode was in production, so they used the source material as a slim template, like the Slithers joke.)\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cLisa\u2019s casting spells at an eighth-grade level; you\u2019ve sinned against nature.\u201d\n\n39. \u201cHell Toup\u00e9e,\u201d Treehouse of Horror IX (Season 10, 1998)\n\nPlot: Homer acquires Snake\u2019s luxurious hair after the jailbird is sent to the electric chair. Once the hair\u2019s fused to his scalp, Homer starts thinking like Snake, and goes after those who sent him to the Big House in the first place, including Bart.\n\nReason for Ranking: Snake\u2019s never been a favorite of mine (except for his brief stint as the wallet inspector), so maybe I\u2019m letting my personal preferences get in the way, but I\u2019m not much of a fan of \u201cToup\u00e9e.\u201d Unlike World\u2019s Deadliest Executions, which I never miss an episode of.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cThat\u2019s what I call a bad hair day!\u201d\n\n38. \u201cScary Tales Can Come True,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XI (Season 12, 2000)\n\nPlot: In an elaborate fairy-tale takeoff, Homer abandons Bart and Lisa in the middle of the woods to help solve the family\u2019s food-shortage problem. They end up imprisoned at an evil witch\u2019s house, while Homer is forced to begrudgingly rescue them after Marge criticizes his decision.\n\nReason for Ranking: They stole a joke from The Brady Bunch, replacing the fake name \u201cGeorge Glass\u201d with \u201cGeorge Cauldron.\u201d Even if it\u2019s an homage, they could have aimed higher.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cBoy, dumping your kids in the forest sure gets your hands dusty.\u201d \u201cWhat? You threw our precious babies into the woods? We could have sold them!\u201d\n\n37. \u201cThere\u2019s No Business Like Moe Business,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XX (Season 21, 2009)\n\nPlot: In a hundreds-of-miles-from-Broadway musical, Homer\u2019s blood is used to sweeten Moe\u2019s beer. Meanwhile, Moe is acting sweet toward his forbidden love, Marge, who thinks her husband left her because he\u2019s gay. In other words, it\u2019s Sweeney Todd \u2026 kind of.\n\nReason for Ranking: If there\u2019s one thing The Simpsons has always done well, it\u2019s musicals. (Please ignore that although the episode spoofs Sweeney Todd, the episode title is modeled after a song from Annie Get Your Gun.) The concept isn\u2019t out of nowhere, either: Moe has always been infatuated by \u201cMidge,\u201d so his revenge makes sense in a Treehouse episode.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cBart, Linda, and the other one there need a dad.\u201d \u201cThat does sound like Homer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Island of Dr. Hibbert.\u201d Photo: FOX\n\n36. \u201cThe Island of Dr. Hibbert,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XIII (Season 14, 2002)\n\nPlot: A parody of H.G. Wells\u2019s The Island of Dr. Moreau, starring Dr. Hibbert as the crazy doctor who turns humans into animals.\n\nReason for Ranking: The jokes are nothing special, but the visuals are fantastic. It\u2019s a lot of fun seeing which animals the residents of Springfield turn into, from the obvious (Homer is a walrus) to more inspired choices (the Squeaky-Voiced Teen and Luigi become a donkey and guinea pig, respectively).\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cThe House of Pain? I guess this is where you pay the bill. Why am I always funny when no one\u2019s around?\u201d\n\n35. \u201cDesperately Xeeking Xena,\u201d Treehouse of Horror X (Season 11, 1999)\n\nPlot: Due to a freak accident, Stretch Dude (Bart) and Clobber Girl (Lisa) have superhuman abilities. They have to hunt down the Collector, who has taken Lucy Lawless for his collection.\n\nReason for Ranking: If Bart was a superhero, he would use his powers for pranks, and this segment does a fine job of keeping consistent to his inherent Bart-ness, something that\u2019s tough to do in a Treehouse episode. Needs more Lucy Lawless.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cIn episode BF12, you were battling barbarians while riding a winged Appaloosa, yet in the very next scene, my dear, you\u2019re clearly atop a winged Arabian. Please do explain it.\u201d \u201cAh, yeah, well, whenever you notice something like that, a wizard did it.\u201d\n\n34. \u201cEasy-Bake Coven,\u201d Treehouse of Horror VIII (Season 9, 1997)\n\nPlot: In 1649, witch burnings are all the rage, and Marge has been accused of being a Warted One. For once, the senseless rioting in Springfield is correct, because Marge, along with Patty and Selma, are actually witches.\n\nReason for Ranking: Not only does the episode feature Marge, Patty, and Selma as witches, an always-winning combination, \u201cCoven\u201d cleverly explains how the idea of trick-or-treating came to be, thanks to the narration of the Sea Captain. It also involves child cannibalism. That\u2019s not a Treehouse first (that\u2019s later), but it\u2019s still worth nothing.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cIf they\u2019re really witches, why don\u2019t they use their powers to escape?\u201d \u201cThat sounds like witch-talk to me, Lisa.\u201d\n\n33. \u201cStop the World, I Want to Goof Off,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XIV (Season 15, 2003)\n\nPlot: Bart and Milhouse order a stopwatch from an old comic book, which allows them to literally control time. Boys being boys and all, they have some fun with this, including giving the pope a wedgie. They have a blast until the watch breaks.\n\nReason for Ranking: It\u2019s pretty much the same idea as \u201cWar and Pieces,\u201d but funnier, with Bart and Milhouse acting in character as two young menances who realize their actions have consequences when it\u2019s nearly too late.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cDo you realize what this means?\u201d \u201cYeah, but you say it first.\u201d\n\n32. \u201cG-G-Ghost D-D-Dad,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XI (Season 12, 2000)\n\nPlot: Homer\u2019s horoscope reads that he\u2019s going to die. It\u2019s not the rattlesnake bite (or compliment from Lenny) that does him in \u2014 it\u2019s a piece of broccoli. When in Heaven, St. Peter instructs Homer to do one good deed to gain admission past the Pearly Gates.\n\nReason for Ranking: It\u2019s well-structured, and the specificity of Homer\u2019s death, rather than haphazardly casual violence, is something Treehouse episodes would lose in later years.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cThat horoscope was baloney. Nothing happened except the pickaxe in my head, the rattlesnake bite, and the testicle thing.\u201d\n\n31. \u201cLife\u2019s a Glitch, Then You Die,\u201d Treehouse of Horror X (Season 11, 1999)\n\nPlot: Homer\u2019s laziness ruins the festivities of December 31, 1999/January 1, 2000, when the Y2K virus spreads worldwide, causing computers everywhere to go haywire. The \u201cbest and brightest\u201d that humanity have to offer are invited onto a spaceship off Earth before it explodes, and Homer and Bart scheme their way on to it.\n\nReason for Ranking: The \u201cbest and brightest\u201d is in quotes, because the ship is actually filled with the planet\u2019s most obnoxious celebrities, including Pauly Shore and Tom Arnold. \u201cLife\u2019s a Glitch\u201d would be higher if the writers knew to include Roseanne Barr, instead.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cMan alive, what a stink-o thousand years! Blimp wrecks, teenagers\u2026 then again, we had two TV shows with Andy Griffith.\u201d \u201cAnd eleven with Robert Urich.\u201d\n\n\u201cBad Dream House.\u201d Photo: FOX\n\n30. \u201cBad Dream House,\u201d Treehouse of Horror I (Season 2, 1990)\n\nPlot: The Simpsons move into a new house built on an Indian burial ground built where the walls bleed and objects fly through the air. It\u2019s also a house that tells each member of the family to kill each other, because it wants to be left alone.\n\nReason for Ranking: It\u2019s the very first Treehouse segment, so the writers were still fine-tuning the tone and humor, but overall, it\u2019s a solid start.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cThey are all against you, Bart. You must kill them all. They all must die\u2026\u201d \u201cAre you my conscience?\u201d \u201cI\u2026 yes, I am.\u201d\n\n29. \u201cBart\u2019s Nightmare,\u201d Treehouse of Horror II (Season 3, 1991)\n\nPlot: Springfield is terrified of Bart for being able to read minds; he also possesses other omnipotent abilities, like the power to turn Homer into a jack-in-the-box.\n\nReason for Ranking: It\u2019s certainly in character for Bart to have a bad dream about getting along with Homer (the horror). But the segment\u2019s not as classic as the video game Bart\u2019s Nightmare or as terrifying as The Tracey Ullman Show short, \u201cBart\u2019s Nightmare.\u201d\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cWell, class, the history of our country has been changed again, to correspond with Bart\u2019s answers on yesterday\u2019s test. America was now discovered in 1942 by\u2026 Some Guy. And our country isn\u2019t called America anymore. It\u2019s Bonerland.\u201d\n\n28. \u201cNight of the Dolphin,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XI (Season 12, 2000)\n\nPlot: Lisa lets a dolphin named Snorky escape from Marine World after seeing his trainers taunt him for the amusement of slack-jawed yokels. The fugitive tells his underwater buddies what the humans have been doing to their kind. Things get real ugly real quick for humanity.\n\nReason for Ranking: Some day, when the dolphins rise from the seas and are about to kill us all (can\u2019t say we don\u2019t deserve it), this segment will seem a lot less funny and a lot more prophetic. Until then, however, please enjoy the adorable underwater dolphin speak.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cBottlenose bruises. Blowhole burns. Flipper prints. This looks like the work of rowdy teens. Lou, cancel the prom.\u201d\n\n27. \u201cHungry Are the Damned,\u201d Treehouse of Horror I (Season 2, 1990)\n\nPlot: The Simpsons are abducted by Kang or Kodos, who either want to eat them or treat them like kings.\n\nReason for Ranking: Kang and Kodos are so memorable in this segment (and try to be so good to the Simpsons) that they\u2019ve appeared in every Treehouse since.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cWe offered you paradise. You would have experienced emotions a hundred times greater than what you call love. And a thousand times greater than what you call fun. You would have been treated like gods and lived forever in beauty. But now, because of your distrustful nature, that can never be.\u201d \u201cFor a superior race, they really rub it in.\u201d\n\n26. \u201cIt\u2019s the Grand Pumpkin, Milhouse,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XIX (Season 20, 2008)\n\nPlot: Milhouse\u2019s wishes come true when the Grand Pumpkin turns out to be real, but he\u2019s pissed that humans carve up his pumpkin brothers and sisters for fun. There\u2019s only one creature who can save the town now: Tom Turkey, at least until he hears what we do to turkeys \u2026\n\nReason for Ranking: \u201cGrand Pumpkin\u201d begins as a simple Peanuts parody, but eventually becomes its own thing that successfully integrates another holiday. That doesn\u2019t always work.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cTouch me and I\u2019ll cut your friend.\u201d \u201cWhat do I care? That\u2019s a yellow pumpkin.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a racist!\u201d \u201cAll pumpkins are racist. The difference is that I admit it.\u201d\n\n25. \u201cI Know What You Diddily-Iddily-Did,\u201d Treehouse of Horror X (Season 11, 1999)\n\nPlot: Marge accidentally kills Flanders during one of his fog walks. Homer decides that the only reasonable course of action is to stage Ned\u2019s death. After convincing Maude that her husband has passed, the Simpsons find the phrase, \u201cI KNOW WHAT YOU DID\u201d all over their house.\n\nReason for Ranking: For a month after this episode aired, I sang, \u201cGuess I forgot to put the foglights in\u201d to the tune of the Golden Crisp theme song nearly every day. It was an unbearable time to be around me (this is still true), but a good time to be a Simpsons fan.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cNeddy? Where have you been?\u201d \u201cHi Maude-diddily. I\u2019ve been having fun with my pal Homer. Diddily.\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019m so relieved. Whenever you go on one of your late-night fog walks I get so worried.\u201d \u201cRelax, I\u2019m fine. But when I do die, I don\u2019t want any autopsies!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Ned Zone.\u201d Photo: FOX\n\n24. \u201cThe Ned Zone,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XV (Season 16, 2004)\n\nPlot: Ned gains powers that allow him to see how anyone who touches him will die.\n\nReason for Ranking: Hans Moleman gets eaten by a group of alligators. It ranks among the best Moleman deaths, and the rest of \u201cThe Ned Zone\u201d is solid, too, including the apocalyptic ending.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cIf you must kill our dad, remember the family motto: not in the face.\u201d\n\n23. \u201cFly vs. Fly,\u201d Treehouse of Horror VIII (Season 9, 1997)\n\nPlot: Homer buys a transporter from a garage sale, using it to fetch beer and go to the bathroom with more efficiency. One night, Bart tries to transport himself with a fly, thinking they\u2019ll become some kind of superhero, but they\u2019re instead mutated into a giant insect with a human body.\n\nReason for Ranking: It\u2019s believable that Bart would think he could take a shortcut to becoming a superhero. It\u2019s even more believable that he would mutate with the closest animal to him, in this case, a fly. The \u201cI\u2019ll axe you good\u201d threat is a good one to keep handy.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cHey, dad, can I use the transporter sometimes? Please, I swear I\u2019ll be careful!\u201d \u201cSorry, but this is a highly sophisti-ma-cated doo-wacky. If you don\u2019t use it responsibly, KA-BLAM-O!\u201d\n\n22. \u201cThe Terror of Tiny Toon,\u201d Treehouse of Horror IX (Season 10, 1998)\n\nPlot: Bart uses a piece of plutonium as a battery for the remote control, which results in him and Lisa being sucked into the television, where the encounter their favorite cat-and-mouse duo, Worker and Parasite \u2014 I mean, Itchy and Scratchy.\n\nReason for Ranking: It\u2019s always fun when The Simpsons acknowledge that it\u2019s, in fact, a cartoon. The more (literal) eye-popping, the better, and it\u2019s amazing that it took the show until the ninth Treehouse to have the characters interact with Itchy and Scratchy.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cOh Homer, you\u2019re not going as a hobo again?\u201d \u201cGoing where?\u201d\n\n21. \u201cReaper Madness,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XIV (Season 15, 2003)\n\nPlot: Homer becomes the Grim Reaper after killing the Angel of Death.\n\nReason for Ranking: It\u2019s funny enough to be higher, but the fact that Family Guy pulled off the same plot, with (hot-take alert) superior results, knocks \u201cMadness\u201d down a little.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cDeath, we miss you so much! You were a busboy in the restaurant of life, clearing away the oldies and the sickies and the junkies. And you made NASCAR racing exciting!\u201d\n\n\u201cDial \u2018Z\u2019 for Zombies.\u201d Photo: FOX\n\n20. \u201cDial \u2018Z\u2019 for Zombies,\u201d Treehouse of Horror III (Season 4, 1992)\n\nPlot: Dead bodies from the local cemetery come back to life after Bart utters an incantation from The Time Life Book of Magic and Spells, Vol. II. The zombies take over the town.\n\nReason for Ranking: As far as zombie comedies go, \u201cDial Z for Zombies,\u201d with its message about pop-culture addicts acting as zombie-like as actual zombies, is more Shaun of the Dead than Dead Snow. (To quote another scene from this episode, \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d)\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cIs this the end of Zombie Shakespeare?\u201d\n\n19. \u201cSend In the Clones,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XIII (Season 14, 2002)\n\nPlot: Homer\u2019s new hammock is magical, and it clones copies of anything or anyone that spins around on it. So, of course, Homer creates multiple copies of himself to shirk his responsibilities.\n\nReason for Ranking: It\u2019s a silly episode, but the sight of hundreds of Homers is amusing, especially the one who takes the form of Peter Griffin Homer.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cLet\u2019s all go out for some frosty chocolate milkshakes!\u201d\n\n18. \u201cHomer\u00b3,\u201d Treehouse of Horror VI (Season 7, 1995)\n\nPlot: While hiding from Patty and Selma, Homer stumbles into an alternate dimension where everything is in 3-D.\n\nReason for Ranking: The visuals aren\u2019t as mind-blowing as they were in 1995, but that Tron joke will always be funny. It\u2019s also the rare Treehouse where we care about a character\u2019s fate (Homer\u2019s extra-dimensional trip is nearly as lonely as when he goes on his mysterious voyage).\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cI don\u2019t want to alarm you, Marge, but I seem to be trapped in here.\u201d \u201cI better call Ned. He has a ladder.\u201d\n\n17. \u201cHex and the City,\u201d Treehouse of Horror XII (Season 13, 2001)\n\nPlot: After he destroys her business, Homer gets cursed by a gypsy.\n\nReason for Ranking: I love a good leprechaun joke, and \u201cHex\u201d has as many of them as marshmallows in a box of Lucky Charms. It also points out the differences between a goblin and a hobgoblin. Informative!\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cYou know, I was hexed by a troll, and a leprechaun cured that right up.\u201d \u201cHey, you know what\u2019s even better is Jesus. He\u2019s like six leprechauns.\u201d \u201cYeah, but a lot harder to catch. Go with a leprechaun.\u201d\n\n16. \u201cNightmare Cafeteria,\u201d Treehouse of Horror V (Season 6, 1994)\n\nPlot: The teachers and staff at Springfield Elementary begin eating students after the detention halls become too crowded.\n\nReason for Ranking: Before every Treehouse turned into a splatterfest, it was still a shock to see the Springfield Elementary staff fatten and eat the students. It\u2019s a relief when the two Simpson children aren\u2019t victims of cannibalism\u2026 but they do get turned inside out by fog.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cRelax, kids, I\u2019ve got a GUT feeling \u00dcter is around here. After all, isn\u2019t there a little \u00dcter in all of us? In fact, you might even say we just ATE \u00dcter and he\u2019s in our stomachs right now! Wait\u2026 scratch that one.\u201d\n\n15. \u201cThe Genesis Tub,\u201d Treehouse of Horror VII (Season 8, 1996)\n\nPlot: Lisa\u2019s science experiment goes even better than expected when, instead of finding out whether cola rots a tooth, she instead discovers a civilization residing in the tooth\u2019s petri dish.\n\nReason for Ranking: There aren\u2019t enough Treehouse segments that focus on Lisa, but this one\u2019s so good, with such a fantastically bleak ending, that I can almost look past this injustice. Almost. (\u201cThe Genesis Tub\u201d would also be parodied in the South Park episode, \u201cSimpsons Did It.\u201d)\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cTiny little people! My God! I\u2019ve created life!\u201d \u201cLisa! Breakfast! We\u2019re having waffles!\u201d \u201cOoh! Waffles!\u201d\n\n\u201cBart Simpson\u2019s Dracula.\u201d Photo: FOX\n\n14. \u201cBart Simpson\u2019s Dracula,\u201d Treehouse of Horror IV (Season 5, 1993)\n\nPlot: Mr. Burns bites Bart, turning the boy into a vampire. Soon, many of Springfield\u2019s residents are also creatures of the night, and Lisa swears to kill the head vampire.\n\nReason for Ranking: It\u2019s not often that a Treehouse segment is genuinely creepy, but the sight of Bart hovering outside Lisa\u2019s bedroom is chill-worthy. I also enjoy the episode\u2019s unexpected final reveal about who the head vampire actually is.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cThe only way to get Bart back is to kill the head vampire: Mr. Burns!\u201d \u201cKill my boss? Do I dare to live out the American dream?\u201d\n\n13. \u201cThe H\u03a9mega Man,\u201d Treehouse of Horror VIII (Season 9, 1997)\n\nPlot: The French launch a nuclear bomb toward Springfield, and after it hits, there\u2019s only one man left alive: Homer. Or so he thinks.\n\nReason for Ranking: The French frog joke is whatever, but the premise \u2014 and Homer singing Edwin Starr\u2019s \u201cWar\u201d in church \u2014 overshadows the too-easy stereotype.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cNow, this baby is called \u2018The Withstandinator.\u2019 It can take a six megaton blast. No more, no less.\u201d\n\n12. \u201cThe Raven,\u201d Treehouse of Horror I (Season 2, 1990)\n\nPlot: \u201cOnce upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary\u2026\u201d\n\nReason for Ranking: \u201cThe Raven\u201d isn\u2019t funny, necessarily, but it\u2019s an impressive feat in adaptation, with James Earl Jones reading Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s famous words. I imagine this was the segment Simpsons fans talked about the next day, and if the reception hadn\u2019t been strong, who knows if Treehouse of Horror would become an annual tradition?\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cAnd the lamp-light o\u2019er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted \u2014 nevermore!\u201d\n\n11. \u201cLisa\u2019s Nightmare,\u201d Treehouse of Horror II (Season 3, 1991)\n\nPlot: Homer buys a monkey paw during a family vacation to Morocco that grants its owner four wishes.\n\nReason for Ranking: It\u2019s technically the first \u201cthe Simpsons are going to\u2026!\u201d episode, in case that comes up during trivia night. Also, it mocked The Simpsons becoming an inescapable brand before anyone else did, proving yet again how often the writers thought ahead.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cSir, I must strongly advise you: Do not purchase this. Behind every wish lurks grave misfortune. I, myself, was once president of Algeria.\u201d \u201cCome on, pal, I don\u2019t want to hear your life story. Paw me!\u201d\n\n10. \u201cAttack of the 50-Foot Eyesores,\u201d Treehouse of Horror VI (Season 7, 1995)\n\nPlot: Homer steals Lard Lad\u2019s gigantic metal doughnut. Due to a freak lightning storm, Mr. Lad and other oversize advertising figures come to life during the night, searching for the missing doughnut and wreaking havoc on Springfield.\n\nReason for Ranking: Don\u2019t like how high \u201cEyesores\u201d is? Well, just don\u2019t look. Just don\u2019t look.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cIf your advertising agency created all those giant characters, you must know how to stop them.\u201d \u201cWell sir, advertising is a funny thing. If people stop paying attention to it, pretty soon, it goes away.\u201d \u201cLike that old woman who couldn\u2019t find the beef?\u201d \u201cExactly.\u201d\n\n\u201cKing Homer.\u201d Photo: FOX\n\n9. \u201cKing Homer,\u201d Treehouse of Horror III (Season 4, 1992)\n\nPlot: It\u2019s a retelling of King Kong, starring Homer as the Big Ape himself and Marge as Ann Darrow.\n\nReason for Ranking: It\u2019s a golden rule of comedy: Monkeys are funny \u2014 Homer as a monkey, even funnier. \u201cKing Homer\u201d also contains one of my favorite conversational exchanges of the entire show (see below).\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cHey, I heard we\u2019re goin\u2019 to Ape Island.\u201d \u201cYeah, to capture a giant ape.\u201d \u201cI wished we were going to Candy Apple Island.\u201d \u201cCandy Apple Island? What do they got there?\u201d \u201cApes. But they\u2019re not so big.\u201d\n\n8. \u201cThe Thing and I,\u201d Treehouse of Horror VII (Season 8, 1996)\n\nPlot: Marge, Homer, and Dr. Hibbert tell Bart that his formerly conjoined twin, Hugo, is living in the attic, feasting on fish heads. But he\u2019s escaped.\n\nReason for Ranking: It\u2019s sick and twisted, with a clever conclusion that explains a lot about Bart.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cBut what to do with poor Hugo? Too crazy for Boy Town, too much of a boy for Crazy Town. The child was an outcast. So, we did the only humane thing.\u201d \u201cWe chained Hugo up in the attic like an animal and fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week.\u201d \u201cIt saved our marriage.\u201d\n\n7. \u201cTerror at 5\u00bd Feet,\u201d Treehouse of Horror IV (Season 5, 1993)\n\nPlot: A gremlin is slowly tearing apart a Springfield Elementary bus. Bart cries wolf the morning after dreaming about dying in a bus crash, but no one believes him.\n\nReason for Ranking: Not only is the script solid, the animation is perfect. Without a rainy, dull atmosphere, \u201cTerror\u201d wouldn\u2019t have worked. But it does, spectacularly. The world needs more gremlins, too.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cHey Bart, look: Krusty trading cards! The long-awaited Eight Series!\u201d \u201cKrusty visits relatives in Annapolis, Maryland. Krusty poses for trading card photo.\u201d \u201cHmm\u2026 he seems to be running a little low on ideas.\u201d\n\n6. \u201cThe Devil and Homer Simpson,\u201d Treehouse of Horror IV (Season 5, 1993)\n\nPlot: Homer wants to sell his soul for a doughnut, and Devil Ned Flanders answers. The two go to trial, in front of the Jury of the Damned, to determine who truly owns Homer\u2019s soul.\n\nReason for Ranking: Making Christian do-gooder Ned Flanders the Devil is a wicked stroke of genius, but more importantly: Homer picking at his pastry head answers the eternal question, \u201cIf you were a giant doughnut, would you eat yourself?\u201d (Yes!)\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cWho\u2019s that goat-legged fellow? I like the cut of his jib.\u201d \u201cEr, Prince of Darkness, sir. He\u2019s your eleven o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\n\u201cClown Without Pity.\u201d Photo: FOX\n\n5. \u201cClown Without Pity,\u201d Treehouse of Horror III (Season 4, 1992)\n\nPlot: Homer goes to the House of Evil to buy Bart a birthday present (and maybe pick up some frogurt, too) and settles on a Talking Krusty doll. An EVIL Talking Krusty doll.\n\nReason for Ranking: Among the show\u2019s many, many, many Twilight Zone spoofs, this one is the funniest and the best, if only because the conclusion is so equal parts brilliant and stupid. That\u2019s The Simpsons\u2019 sweet spot, right there.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cThat doll is EVIL, I tells ya. EVIL. EEEEEEVVVVIILLLLL.\u201d \u201cGrandpa, you said that about all the presents.\u201d \u201cI just want attention\u2026\u201d\n\n4. \u201cCitizen Kang,\u201d Treehouse of Horror VII (Season 8, 1996)\n\nPlot: Kang and Kodos take over the bodies of Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, promise abortions for some, miniature American flags for others.\n\nReason for Ranking: \u201cCitizen Kang\u201d masterfully parodies presidential elections (before they became a nightmare), and politics in general, by showing that campaign promises are a bunch of nothing that don\u2019t matter. Either way, you\u2019re boned. But don\u2019t blame me, I voted for Kodos.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cI am looking forward to an orderly election tomorrow, which will eliminate the need for a violent bloodbath.\u201d\n\n3. \u201cTime and Punishment,\u201d Treehouse of Horror V (Season 6, 1994)\n\nPlot: Homer travels through time using a toaster.\n\nReason for Ranking: Every line is a classic. There\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ve gone back in time to when dinosaurs weren\u2019t just confined to zoos,\u201d and \u201cOh, I wish, I wish I hadn\u2019t killed that fish,\u201d and \u201cStupid bug, you go squish now.\u201d Any Treehouse of Horror segment-ranking without \u201cTime and Punishment\u201d near the top is a disturbing universe, indeed.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cOkay, don\u2019t panic. Remember the advice your father gave you on your wedding day.\u201d \u201cIf you ever travel back in time, don\u2019t step on anything, because even the tiniest change can alter the future in ways you can\u2019t imagine.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cNightmare on Evergreen Terrace,\u201d Treehouse of Horror VI (Season 7, 1995)\n\nPlot: Groundskeeper Willie dies in a horrible (and preventable) accident at a PTA meeting, and he vows to get revenge by killing the young students\u2026 in their dreams.\n\nReason for Ranking: It\u2019s another pitch-perfect pastiche of a classic horror movie, yet funny enough that even if you haven\u2019t seen Nightmare on Elm Street (or any of its 1,453 sequels), all the jokes still land.\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cIt all started on the 13th hour, of the 13th day, of the 13th month\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Shinning.\u201d Photo: FOX\n\n1. \u201cThe Shinning,\u201d Treehouse of Horror V (Season 6, 1994)\n\nPlot: Mr. Burns\u2019s sea monkeys, otherwise known as the Simpsons, arrive to look after his creepy-looking lodge. But when he cuts the cable and removes all the beer, Homer starts going something something. Oh, and Willie gets hit in the back with an ax.\n\nReason for Ranking: The sign of a good parody? When you can\u2019t think of the original without also thinking of the spoof. That\u2019s The Shining and \u201cThe Shinning,\u201d easily the best Treehouse segment of all time. (But don\u2019t think of either between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. That\u2019s Willie\u2019s time!)\n\nMemorable Quote: \u201cCome, family. Sit in the snow with daddy and let us all bask in television\u2019s warm glowing warming glow.\u201d", "description": "A ranking of every segment from the Treehouse of Horror Halloween episodes of Matt Groening\u2019s animated Fox comedy series \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d from worst to best.", "authors": ["Joshua Kurp"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/10/24/simpsons/24-simpsons-horror-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
