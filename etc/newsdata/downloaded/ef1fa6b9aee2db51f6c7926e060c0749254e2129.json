Late last night, the companies were still negotiating.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGoing to trial could have cost the drug companies more than $8 billion if Cuyahoga and Summit counties were awarded all the money they were seeking. It also buys the companies time to try to fashion a more wide-ranging settlement with the 2,400 cities, counties, Native American tribes and others that have sued the drug industry. Their cases have been consolidated in a sprawling \u201cmultidistrict litigation\u201d before a federal judge here.\n\nThe Ohio counties would receive $215 million in cash from the distributors and another $20 million from Teva, according to people aware of the settlement, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations. Teva also would supply another $25 million in anti-addiction medication.\n\nThe settlement with the four companies follows the collapse of an extraordinary effort Friday to reach a deal covering all the cases. U.S. District Court Judge Dan Aaron Polster summoned the chief executives of the three big distributors and representatives of the other two companies to his courtroom here in an effort to hammer out an agreement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlso called were the plaintiffs lawyers and four state attorneys general who represented dozens of states that have been negotiating with the drug companies. Nearly every state has sued a variety of companies in state courts.\n\nPolster, who has urged a mass settlement for nearly two years, shuttled among the parties, trying to find common ground. But after about 10 hours of talks, the negotiations ended without agreement.\n\nMore than 200,000 people have died of overdoses of prescription narcotics in the past two decades and another 200,000 have succumbed to overdoses of heroin and illegal fentanyl, which is now the main drug propelling the crisis.\n\nThe counties\u2019 argument rests mainly on the sheer volume of drugs the companies poured into northeastern Ohio. They contend the distributors, motivated by profits, did little to monitor doses that spilled into the black market, ignoring obvious signs as they filled order after order.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey argue that deluge created a \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d that endangered residents\u2019 health and are seeking $7.2 billion to remedy the crisis. They also want another billion in damages.\n\nPolster has ruled that if the jury finds the companies liable, he will decide how much they must pay to remedy the public nuisance.\n\nIn August, an Oklahoma judge found health care giant Johnson & Johnson liable for fueling the opioid crisis and order the company to pay the state $572 million on a similar public nuisance claim. After a seven-week trial, Judge Thad Balkman agreed with the state\u2019s claim that the company had endangered public health by aggressively marketing opioids and by importing and processing the raw materials for oxycodone.\n\nAD\n\nJohnson & Johnson has appealed that decision.\n\nIn this case, Cuyahoga and Summit counties also claim the companies worked together like a drug cartel, conspiring to expand their market, deceptively promote their products and minimize addiction risks.\n\nThe drug companies deny the accusations, asserting they delivered legitimate medications to patients suffering from cancer and other painful conditions and complied with regulations set by the DEA and the Food and Drug Administration. They also deny working in concert, contending the counties cannot prove any direct link between their conduct and the harms or expenses incurred.\n\nAD", "description": "But the deal covers only two Ohio counties, leaving thousands more to fight it out in court or hammer out similar deals.", "authors": ["Lenny Bernstein", "Reporter Covering Health", "Scott Higham", "Investigative Reporter", "Sari Horwitz", "Reporter Covering The Justice Department", "Criminal Justice Issues For The Washington Post'S National Security Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3RE_lyXuGJ_AqZjAvhlhyrH1FCg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZJ4NFYXPSUI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
