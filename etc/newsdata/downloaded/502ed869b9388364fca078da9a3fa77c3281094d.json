Usually he sits by a window looking out in the afternoon smiling and waiting for us,' she said.\n\nWhen she and Masua's aunt arrived on Wednesday, she found his wheelchair up against a wall in the centre.\n\n'He was facing the wall playing with some little cars,' she said.\n\nIt wasn't until she spun his wheelchair around that she noticed the red wounds taking up half of his face.\n\nNobody from the school had contacted her to tell her Masua had been hurt, she said.\n\nAn aunt, Leika Tusa, said his injuries looked like he'd been 'beaten up'.\n\nHis left eye was swollen shut, he had puss oozing from cuts to more than half his face and blood pouring from his nose.\n\nMasua's mother has now pulled him from the school all together, saying its the second time they've let her down while caring for her only child\n\nDue to Masua's limited verbal communication skills, he is unable to tell his parents exactly what happened.\n\nWHAT IS CEREBRAL PALSY? Cerebral palsy is a movement disorder which affects muscle tone and flexibility. More than 34,000 people are living with cerebral palsy in Australia. The cause is largely unknown and there is no known cure. It is a lifelong condition. In 13 out of 14 cases of cerebral palsy in Australia, the brain injury leading to cerebral palsy occurs either in the uterus (while the mother is pregnant) or before one month of age.\n\nMasua's mother has now pulled him from the school all together, claiming it was the second time they had let her down while caring for her only child.\n\nIn future, she's hoping to home school Masua.\n\nMasua's grandmother Mary Tusa told Daily Mail Australia that her grandson is 'a bright boy'.\n\n'He just can't talk very well, but he understands everything,' she said.\n\nShe said he's needing to have his wounds dressed and bandaged regularly, but that he is slowly recovering.\n\n'But we can't feel his pain,' she said.\n\nThe family have contacted police, who are currently investigating the matter.\n\nThe daycare centre, which Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to name, said in a statement to New Zealand Herald they are taking the matter seriously.\n\n'We're working with our head office and we're also working with the Ministry of Education, as well, to make sure that they know that we worked hard to try and do everything that we could for him,' they said.", "description": "Masua Tusa - usually a happy and smiley child - was dazed and confused when his mother came to pick him up from kindergarten in Auckland, New Zealand on Wednesday afternoon.", "authors": ["Brittany Chain For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/23/19610298-0-image-a-10_1570832447291.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
