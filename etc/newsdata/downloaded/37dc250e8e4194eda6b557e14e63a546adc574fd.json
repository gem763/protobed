I expect you to apologize for the damage you have done to the martini.\u201d\n\n[Make the recipe: Classic Martini]\n\nHaving daydreamed of this for years, I laughed aloud when I arrived at the James Bond-related part of drinks writer Robert Simonson\u2019s terrific new book, \u201cThe Martini Cocktail.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis chapter will be short, because I find its subject such an irritant,\u201d Simonson writes. \u201cSince at least the 1970s, no journalist has gotten away with writing about the Martini without addressing James Bond. Often they begin their story with Bond. Because Bond, more than sixty-five years after writer Ian Fleming dreamed up the suave British superspy, is still the first thing many people think of in connection to the Martini.\u201d\n\nI guess it\u2019s too late to rethink my lead?\n\nSimonson goes on to explain our shared pique: Bond\u2019s famous \u201cshaken, not stirred\u201d order is infamous in the cocktail world (martinis, most agree, should not be shaken), as is the fact that Bond usually orders the drink with vodka, a spirit with much less complexity than gin.\n\nSimonson and I made no such gaffes when we sat down recently for martinis at Maison Premiere in Brooklyn. The restaurant\u2019s Old King Cole martini (one of dozens in Simonson\u2019s book) combines Old Raj gin, Mancino secco vermouth and Angostura orange bitters. Presenting it is a two-person job: One server holds the tray of ingredients; another assembles, stirs and pours the drink tableside, served with a choice of garnishes \u2014 olives, lemon peel, seaweed \u2014 and a tiny spoon of caviar, if you like. We liked.\n\n[The 7 essential cocktails every drinker should know how to make]\n\nOur drinks came with a story, the server explaining that the Old King Cole name is based on the tale that the martini originated at the Knickerbocker Hotel in New York, whose bar had a Maxfield Parrish mural of Old King Cole.\n\n\u201cThe story is nonsense,\u201d Simonson noted, but the resulting martini is all it should be.\n\nSimonson, brave fellow, drank hundreds of martinis researching his book, which delves into the drink\u2019s fascinating history and faux histories, its spinoffs, the evolution of preferences around gin vs. vodka. And, of course, it touches on the vermouth-to-spirit ratio, long one of the greatest points of debate about the drink.\n\nHis desire to write the book, in fact, was inspired by a martini recipe competition he wrote about. He was one of several judges on the panel, which tasted 27 variations and chose a winner far lower in vermouth \u2014 much closer to the older style \u2014 than the 1-to-1 ratio lately heralded in the cocktail world.\n\nHis article reporting the results came out, \u201cand people flipped! They were so mad that a 50:50 did not win,\u201d Simonson says. \u201cI was just kind of amazed by the response. And it occurred to me: People are still getting upset about martinis! After 135 years, they\u2019re still angry about this drink, and they\u2019re still arguing about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked him, somewhat facetiously. After all, I like arguing about martinis myself. But so much analysis and wit has been expended on the drink that sometimes it seems even to evoke its name is to add another layer to a heavily gilded lily.\n\n\u201cIt certainly helped that writers and artists took up the cause and decided it was worth arguing about,\u201d Simonson says. \u201cIt is a very singular cocktail. People think martinis are simple. It\u2019s gin and vermouth, leaving aside the vodka question for the moment. But gin has all these things in it, and vermouth has all these things in it, and if you throw in the orange bitters, you\u2019re dealing with even more. The balance of all those botanicals is kind of bewitching.\u201d\n\nMaking it right\n\nLots of people have a preference about their martinis, and if you\u2019re hosting, it\u2019s smart to find out what it is. Here is how to approach the variables while understanding the rules:\n\nChoose your base. Gin is the classic choice, and many will argue, a better one than vodka. But gin-haters do exist, so you\u2019ll need to check. You might try the adventurous ones on a Vesper, a martini variation that combines gin and vodka (and was created by Bond in one of Ian Fleming\u2019s novels \u2014 arguably the spy\u2019s one good contribution to cocktails).\n\nDecide your spirit-to-vermouth ratio. Many people have come to understand that good vermouth is a thing of beauty. But those raised on ultradry martinis may not have come around yet. Ratios range from the contemporary 50:50 to a scant whisper of vermouth. A 5-to-1 or 4-to-1 gin-to-vermouth split is a good starting point.\n\nNail the garnish game. The choice of an olive or a swath of expressed lemon peel changes the whole drink. Add a cocktail onion, you\u2019ve got a variation known as a Gibson. Add olive juice for a dirty martini, or an olive stuffed with blue cheese for a murky nightma \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, for a drink many people love. Different bitters can also bring out new flavors.\n\nServe it very cold and properly diluted. A hefty pour of spirit and vermouth, the martini needs the dilution it gets when stirred with ice. Treat the process patiently, and remember to chill your glassware. With all the arguments about martinis, it\u2019s hard \u2014 but not impossible \u2014 to find someone arguing it doesn\u2019t need to be cold.\n\nRemember, ingredients vary. If you delve more deeply into martinis, tasting for nuances of flavor, you\u2019ll start to understand why people still argue about them. One gin is not the same as the next. Ditto the vermouth, ditto the bitters, and each combines with the other ingredients a little bit differently. You can use the same classic spec and still end up with different drinks.\n\nBe a little scared of it. This is not some sessionable little spritzer. Aside from the dilution from the ice, this baby is a solid wave of booze coming at you. Treat it accordingly.\n\n\n\nBatched Martinis.\n\nBatched Martinis\n\nThere\u2019s some debate in the bar world about pre-batched martinis, where you prep the drink in advance and then hold them in the freezer. Proponents argue that it allows the flavors of the drink to combine. Critics say \u201cNope,\u201d noting that guests served a pre-bottled concoction of someone else\u2019s gin-to-vermouth ratio won\u2019t get the value they do watching their favorite version prepared before their eyes. For the home host, though, batched martinis can be a thing of beauty: You can keep a bottle in the freezer, have drinks ready for anyone who might drop by and modify them on the spot with guests\u2019 preferred garnishes and enhancements. And the drink gets so cold in the freezer, it pours almost like cream \u2014 a thick, arctic sip of boozy goodness.\n\nMake Ahead: The batched cocktail needs to be mixed at least 1\u00bd hours ahead of time.\n\nStorage Notes: The cocktail can be stored in the freezer for up to 6 months.\n\n6 servings; makes 24 ounces\n\nScant 2 cups (450 milliliters) dry gin\n\nScant 2/3 cup (150 milliliters) dry vermouth\n\nScant 2/3 cup (150 milliliters) cold water\n\nAssorted orange bitters, olives and olive brine, lemon twists and/or cocktail onions, for serving\n\nSet up an empty 750-milliliter bottle with a funnel on top. Pour the gin, vermouth and water into the bottle, then seal and shake to combine. Store the bottle in the freezer for at least 90 minutes and up to 6 months.\n\nBefore service, chill glasses for 5 to 10 minutes. When ready to serve, customize the drinks based on individual preferences: Add a dash or two of orange bitters, or a splash of olive juice if they like a \u201cdirty\u201d martini. Garnish with a lemon twist, an olive or a cocktail onion (a variation known as a Gibson) \u2014 or some combination of these.\n\nTuxedo\n\nSupposedly drawing its name from the location that spawned the suit (Tuxedo Park, N.Y.), this 19th-century martini variation has its own variations roaming about; the Tuxedo No. 2 includes vermouth, absinthe and maraschino and is, obviously, a very different beast. This version is an easy, dry and delicious cocktail that echoes the classic martini but subs dry sherry \u2014 such as fino or manzanilla \u2014 for the vermouth, which adds a faintly nutty flavor. While no garnish is specified in most recipes, an orange twist is a nice addition here.\n\n1 serving\n\nIce\n\n2 ounces dry gin\n\n1 ounce dry sherry\n\n1 dash orange bitters\n\nOrange twist, for garnish (optional)\n\nChill a cocktail glass. Fill a mixing glass with ice, then add the gin, sherry and bitters. Stir to chill, 20 to 30 seconds, then strain the drink into the chilled glass. Express the twist of the orange peel over the surface of the drink, if using, then drop it in.\n\n\n\nPuritan Cocktail.\n\nPuritan Cocktail\n\nA terrific martini variation gussied up with a little touch of herbal yellow Chartreuse. The Brooklyn bar Tooker Alley, which provided the specs here, uses Plymouth for the gin and Dolin for the vermouth.\n\n1 serving\n\nIce\n\n2 ounces gin\n\n1 ounce dry vermouth\n\n2 teaspoons yellow Chartreuse\n\n1 dash orange bitters\n\nLemon twist, for garnish\n\nChill a cocktail glass. Fill a mixing glass with ice, and add the gin, vermouth, Chartreuse and bitters. Stir to chill, 30 seconds. Strain into the chilled glass, then express the twist of lemon over the surface of the drink and drop it into the glass.\n\nBatched Martinis and Tuxedo recipes from Spirits columnist M. Carrie Allan.
