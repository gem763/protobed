But that is only the tip of the old iceberg for this Titanic-like team. According to NFL salary cap expert Joel Corry, the team is facing a bill of $31 million over the next two years to pay injured quarterback Alex Smith.

Perhaps that divide in the war room during the draft played into the limited time on the field for Haskins so far this rookie season.\n\nHaskins was selected No. 15 overall, the third quarterback taken in April\u2019s NFL Draft.
