Ratau said this factor was also taken into account.\n\nHe said the general causes of South Africa\u2019s water shortages were: . Less rain, as well as extended droughts and the climate crisis;\n\n. The increasing population and industrial growth; . Aged infrastructure, pollution, wastage of water as a result of leaks in homes, in streets and at large water plants; . Vandalism; and . Illegal water connections.\n\nWillem de Clercq of the Water Institute at Stellenbosch University in the Western Cape said news of the looming water crisis had been general knowledge among experts in the field for a few years already.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe hard reality is that we are at the end point of our water supply \u2013 we have reached the ceiling. Like the current situation with electricity, people will urgently have to begin looking at how they can save water every day,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge is that existing systems have to be changed to firstly make more water available, and secondly to store it. And one has to give the department credit here \u2013 plans to provide enough water have been ready for years, but it\u2019s the implementation of the plans that has failed. Most of the plans only exist on paper, whereas these ideas should already be delivering results.\u201d\n\nRatau said plans the department was looking at included: . The utilisation of new water sources such as rivers where there are no dams at present;\n\n. The utilisation of available underground water; . The reclamation and purification of grey water; . The collection of more rainwater; and . The desalination of sea water, where possible.\n\nHe could not, however, say which of these plans had been developed and executed.\n\n\n\nDe Clercq said the bigger reason for this was that the department did not have money to implement its plans.\n\nThe drought in parts of the country has also forced the department to focus on emergency measures instead of long-term planning.\n\nAccording to De Clercq, desalination was one of the many projects that should already be delivering water, but construction had not even started.\n\nRatau said the department, pending the minister\u2019s approval, planned to release a national water and sanitation intervention plan soon.\n\nAnthony Turton of the department of environmental management at the University of the Free State has warned that the department\u2019s rescue plans often placed too much emphasis on consumers having to save water.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt gets said over and over, and they\u2019re beginning to sound like a stuck record. One has to remember that daily water use, such as drinking water and water to flush toilets, only makes up about 2% of South Africa\u2019s daily water consumption,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe largest quantity of water is needed for agriculture and industrial activities. If we run out of water, it\u2019s going to have enormous implications for our country\u2019s economic wellbeing.\u201d\n\nHe said foreign investors were already scared of investing in South Africa as a result of challenges including an unstable electricity supply.\n\n\u201cIf we have water problems on top of the power problems, the risk simply becomes too big.\u201d\n\nTurton said a few experts were busy establishing the SA Business Water Chamber, which would aim to help government overcome these challenges.", "description": "While everyone has been preoccupied with the recent bout of load shedding, our taps also appear to be running dry.", "authors": ["Suzanne Venter"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9403/0f700196939a466dbf4aa6adebc7c9ac.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
