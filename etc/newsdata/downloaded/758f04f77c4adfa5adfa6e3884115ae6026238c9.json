Reporting indicates that the president has given Turkey the go-ahead for their planned move into Syria, despite what this means for our allies, the Kurds.\n\nBREAKING: In explaining his decision to pull back US military presence in northern Syria, President Trump tweets his view that \"it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home.\" \u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) October 7, 2019\n\nThe While House said @realDonaldTrump gave the Turkish President his blessing for his long-threatened military operation against elements of the Kurdish YPG militia that have been among America\u2019s most effective partners in the fight against ISIS.https://t.co/yz86d5AaND \u2014 Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) October 7, 2019\n\nCue the hawks\u2019 hysteria.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Trump\u2019s decision \u201cvirtually reassures the reemergence of ISIS\u201d and called it \u201cso sad\u201d and \u201cso dangerous.\u201d Meanwhile, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida called the move a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d and warned about the supposed consequences it will have worldwide.\n\nNightmare predictions aside, Trump has shown great bravery with this decision, given the inevitable vitriolic political backlash. The president campaigned on putting America first, and he\u2019s fulfilling that promise to voters no matter how angry the establishment gets. His decision will stop risking American lives and wasting taxpayer dollars on policing Middle East politics. This is long overdue, seeing as our security goals in Syria have already been accomplished.\n\nTo recap, the U.S. military first intervened in the Syrian conflict in 2014. Our goal was to destroy the Islamic State Caliphate, as the terrorist group had built up territorial control of much of the conflict-ridden region.\n\nMission accomplished.\n\nIn 2015, ISIS controlled large amounts of territory in Syria and Iraq, a territory \u201croughly the size of Portugal,\u201d according to CNN . As of February 2019, it controlled just 50 square miles of territory.\n\nNo, the terrorist group hasn\u2019t been entirely eradicated, but it has been degraded to the point of insignificance. It\u2019s time to declare victory and come home. A complete and total elimination of all terrorist capability anywhere was never a feasible goal. To demand such a utopia prior to withdrawal is a recipe for indefinite occupation of half the world.\n\nAnd the costs of our continued world-policing are serious. Just in 2019, at least five American service members have died in Syria, not to mention the countless civilians we\u2019ve killed without even intending to. Those hawks who wish to continue our indefinite involvement in Syria until some mythical time in which the Middle East is not a conflict zone ought to look at the family of the deceased soldier Michael Thomason in the eyes \u2014 he died in April \u2014 and tell his loved ones we are going to keep putting the lives of young men like him at risk to play policemen of the world.\n\nMoreover, our very limited involvement is Syria has cost taxpayers a minimum of $54 billion, according to the Brown University Cost of War Project. It\u2019s time for American involvement in this disaster to come to an end.\n\nI stand with @realDonaldTrump today as he once again fulfills his promises to stop our endless wars and have a true America First foreign policy. \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) October 7, 2019\n\nObjections to Trump\u2019s withdrawal take two forms, both worth taking seriously.\n\nOne school of critics predicts that in the absence of American military involvement, ISIS will make a comeback. This is a worthwhile concern, and worth taking seriously, seeing as something similar happened when former President Obama pulled troops out of Iraq in 2011.\n\nBut that\u2019s not going to happen in Syria. As Trump rightly notes, an involved Turkey will have a strong security incentive not to allow ISIS to re-emerge. So too would regional neighbors such as Russia. And if a terrorism threat were to re-emerge, the U.S. does not need troops on the ground to step back in and fight it through remote strikes.\n\nThink about it like this: Can we really justify endless occupation of a foreign country based on the idea that if we ever leave, a threat might emerge? That logic would have us occupy everywhere, all the time.\n\nThe other chief concern, as pointed out by my Washington Examiner colleague Tom Rogan, is that by pulling out, we will condemn our allies, the Kurds, to death at the hands of merciless Turkish forces.\n\nSyria will continue to be a bloody disaster zone with deaths on all sides either way, and it may be true that leaving puts the Kurds in danger. But we should leave anyway. U.S. foreign policy exists to put America first, and we did not enter Syria or return to Iraq in order to establish a Kurdish state. We never promised the Kurds our ongoing protection or aid in a war of independence in northern Syria. Our own goals and interests should always dictate our military decisions. To risk U.S. lives to police the outcome of the Syrian conflict, which will continue to be extremely bloody no matter what, puts American interests last in a failed attempt to continue policing the world.\n\nAs Stand Together foreign policy expert and Afghanistan veteran William Ruger told me in a statement: \u201cIt is not America\u2019s job to sort out the future of Syria. We were in Syria for a very limited reason \u2014 to eliminate ISIS\u2019s territorial caliphate. We have accomplished that goal, so now it is time to bring our troops from that country home.\u201d\n\nTime to bring our troops home, indeed. President Trump is right to do so now, before more Americans lose their lives in yet another endless war in the Middle East.\n\nIn fact, the president shows great bravery to make a decision that will undoubtedly be so controversial that the entire foreign policy establishment will shriek in unison \u2014 even Fox and Friends host Brian Kilmeade blasted Trump this morning. With the establishment\u2019s abysmal record in the Middle East, you know by their ire that Trump is on to something.", "description": "The foreign policy establishment is having a meltdown \u2014 and if you know anything about the last 20 years of U.S. history, then you know that means something good is happening.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/65c8d6a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x788+0+55/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F79%2F2f%2Fcc1cc7bda80536b19ad01619e542%2Ffc92aa7a3c2f88acdf4be350b09ec551.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
