We went on, and it was nerve-racking, the audience went crazy when they found out we were there. It was like a million decibels high. It was insanity! When the gumboot squad came out to dance with Lebo M, everyone went crazy. This is the best performance I've ever had.\"\n\nSEE THE VIDEO CLIP HERE:\n\nBefore this performance, the Drakensberg Boys Choir had performed at several venues across London and outskirts \u2013 St George's Chapel (Windsor Castle), Great St Mary's Church, The Holiday Inn (in conjunction with the Barnsley Youth Choir), Emmanuel Church, SA House, and at King's College School.\n\nCompiled by Alex Isaacs.
