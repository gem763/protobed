The company redrew almost 40,000 of Helvetica\u2019s characters as part of the Helvetica Now revamp in an attempt to make the typeface feel nicer to read and to work better at smaller sizes.\n\nHellvetica, meanwhile, is a much more anarchic affair. It\u2019s the product of Zack Roif and Matthew Woodward, two New York-based creative directors, and it\u2019s designed specifically to irritate graphic designers around the world. Think of it as a self-aware Comic Sans with kerning that\u2019s somehow much much worse.\n\nIntroducing : HELLvetica. Like helvetica, but with like, much shittier kerning for Halloween.
