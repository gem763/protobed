The momentum has slowed even if progress is still in the right direction.\"\n\nOn Friday, Saudi Arabia announced the launch of tourism visas as part of its push to diversify the economy -- but that was an announcement that many had expected more than a year ago.\n\nAlso mired in delays is the planned stock market listing of state oil giant Aramco, a cornerstone of Prince Mohammed's reform agenda that was initially scheduled for 2018.\n\nDespite all this, the murder has not threatened to unseat the prince.\n\nInstead, he has tightened his grip on military and security agencies and launched a crackdown on political rivals as well as conservative clerics and women activists.\n\n\"Saudi has been hiring Western social media influencers to promote the kingdom and improve its reputation since Khashoggi's murder,\" de Pimodan said.\n\n\"But the murder stain will be hard to wash off.\"", "description": "Saudi Arabia is attempting a comeback on the global stage one year after journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder, but the crisis has weakened it and undermined its de facto leader's ambitious reforms, analysts say.
