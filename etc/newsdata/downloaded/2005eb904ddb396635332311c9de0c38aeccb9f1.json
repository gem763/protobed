It ignited on Monday in LA's wealthiest neighborhoods just after 1.30am along the 405 Freeway and quickly spread to scorch 658 acres as of Tuesday afternoon, triggering a mass evacuation for 20,000 residents.\n\nThe cause of the fire has been determined to be as the result of high winds blowing a branch onto an electric line that caused it to arc, ignite dry grass and destroy a dozen homes, according to the preliminary findings by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) utility and the Fire Department.\n\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department issued these images of the eucalyptus branch on the power line. Local utility LA Dept. of Water and Power said it had cleaned brush in the area during the summer\n\nDWP said that in the summer it had trimmed vegetation in the area near the iconic J. Getty Museum broke out.\n\nThe branch of the eucalyptus, which is a notoriously flammable tree, blew about 30-feet onto the power line, the utility said.\n\nVideo shot by a motorist on Interstate 405 in the early morning showed a bright blue flash on the side of the road where the fire started at the base of a brush-covered steep hillside beneath the Getty Center.\n\n'It really was one of those acts of God,' Mayor Eric Garcetti said.\n\nNeither the pole nor the line failed, and power did not need to be cut off in the area at the time. The utility said it was trying to determine who owned the land.\n\nThis aerial shot shows the Getty Center in Los Angeles standing perilously close to smoldering mansions hit by the Getty Fire\n\nFirefighters dampen down hot spots on a charred hillside in Los Angeles.

Firefighters are scrambling to contain the flames before tonight's devastating Santa Ana wind event\n\nThe blaze left firefighters scrambling to contain the flames, and high winds are predicted to whip Santa Ana on Tuesday night, and threaten to expand the inferno.\n\nAbout 1,100 firefighters were summoned to Los Angeles County to fight the flames, desperately spraying the Brentwood area.\n\nAs of Tuesday evening, 15 percent of the inferno is contained.\n\nFirefighters continue to work around the clock to subdue the flames before the Santa Ana gusts, also known as 'devil winds', hit Tuesday night into Thursday with vicious 70mph blasts that could easily spread the fire.\n\nThe Getty Fire is just one of 17 devastating wildfires burning across California as of Tuesday, razing more than 94,000 acres of land. The fires have sent tens of thousands of locals fleeing, left millions without power, and turned the ocean in Malibu pink with fire retardant.\n\nEleven of the biggest fires raging through California pictured above. The Getty Fire in Los Angeles is the latest fire which sparked Monday and threatened some of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods. Meanwhile the devastating Kincade fire in northern California swelled to twice the size of San Francisco by Tuesday\n\nThis map shows the fires concentrated in Los Angeles County. The active fires include the Tick, Saddle Ridge, Getty and Palisades Fires\n\nEfforts to quell the fire from spreading led authorities to sprinkle fire retardant over Malibu, turning the ocean pink\n\nOfficials say preventing the Getty Fire from expanding under Santa Ana winds is a priority. The natural phenomena are strong and extremely dry downslope gusts that originate inland and are famous for fanning regional wildfires.\n\nThe wind gusts, forecast to be 'remarkable and dangerous' are expected to be the worst the region has seen this season, according to the National Weather Service in Los Angeles. It will bring will bring gusts of 60mph to 70mph winds in the valley and up to 80mph winds in the mountains.\n\n'It only takes one ember to blow downwind to start another fire. We\u2019re very concerned about tonight\u2019s wind event,' LAFD Chief Ralph Terrazas said to the Los Angeles Times.\n\n'We know we're going to have a major wind event tonight at about 11 o'clock that's going to last until Thursday. We're doing everything we can to wrap our arms around this fire to be able to prevent a potential of those strong gusty Santa Ana winds, pushing this fire, rekindling a lot of the fire and blowing embers a mile to two miles down range,' Assistant Chief Jaime Moore with Los Angeles Fire said.\n\nFirefighters try to salvage what they can of this home in Los Angeles during the Getty Fire\n\nFirefighters managed to save part of this home in Los Angeles during the Getty fire\n\nA burnt-out washing machine in a destroyed home is covered in ash\n\nSome homes were completely destroyed, including this one with the skull on its front lawn - presumable a Halloween decoration\n\nAs a result of the fire some 20,000 residents have been ordered to evacuate, including the area's celebrity residents. LA Lakers star LeBron James tweeted that he and his family had to flee in the middle of the night on Monday, while Arnold Schwarzenegger said they evacuated around 3.30am.\n\nCelebrities are also standing up to support California firefighters as they tackle the state's catastrophic fires.\n\nFormer First Lady of California Maria Shriver shared an Instagram post praising first responders for their work in tackling the fire and evacuating locals on Tuesday\n\n'For many like myself, mandatory evacuations are still in effect with high winds expected tonight. To all of our first responders, thank you for staying on this, we are heeding your advice and staying safe! Remember, just because you don\u2019t see active fire right now, doesn\u2019t mean it might not happen tonight when the wind picks up,' she shared\n\nActor John Cena, who plays a firefighter in his upcoming film Playing With Fire, announced on Monday he'll make a $500,000 donation to firefighters. Katherine Schwarzenegger and Chris Pratt have also pledged to donate to the fire rescue effort.\n\n'And on behalf of Playing With Fire' and out of respect to the people who I truly believe are heroes my response will be to immediately donate half a million dollars to this cause,' Cena said. 'In times like this, when people are giving their lives and working around the clock what they need from us is resources.'\n\nFormer First Lady of California Maria Shriver also shared an Instagram post praising first responders for their work in tackling the fire and evacuating locals on Tuesday.\n\nFormer California governor Arnold Scwarzenegger also praised firefighters saying: 'Right now I am grateful for the best firefighters in the world, the true action heroes who charge into the danger to protect their fellow Californians.'\n\nLos Angeles Lakers star LeBron James revealed his family had to evacuate their house in the middle of the night, saying the fires were 'no joke'\n\n'For many like myself, mandatory evacuations are still in effect with high winds expected tonight.

As of Monday evening the expanding fire was just 15 percent contained.\n\nOn Sunday a grass fire broke out along the I-5 highway in Natomas near Sacramento, torching cars and sending local scrambling on foot for safety\n\nFrantic locals were seen running away from the sudden grass blaze under the direction of Contreras\n\nThe Sunday I-5 highway blaze near Sacramento was so strong it left some cars completely burned to ash\n\nSan Francisco firefighters shared heart-stopping video on Tuesday showing the front window view of a firetruck rushing to the front lines of the fire on a burning hill in Sonoma County, passing through thick smoke, orange flames, and blazing embers.\n\nSan Francisco Firefighters Local 798 shared the footage on Twitter showing the Kincade Fire rage at 3am adding: 'We appreciate their complete dedication to the task of protecting lives and property.'\n\nSo far the Kincade Fire has destroyed 123 structures - 57 of which were residential homes. About 90,000 structures are still threatened by the blaze, according to Cal Fire spokesman Jonathan Cox.\n\nOn Tuesday more than 26 million people from California to Arizona were placed under red flag warnings meaning winds, temperatures and humidity levels were dangerous and prone to spreading fires.\n\nThe Kincade fire is particularly hard to contain due to the steep topography of the densely forested hills it's located in. It's also fueled by hurricane-force winds that saw it grow at a rate of one football field every three seconds when it first ignited, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.\n\nWinds are expected to reach 20 to 30mph on Tuesday and will reach 50mph by evening. Officials believe the blaze can be put out by November 7.\n\n'We tentatively believe the fire will be contained November 7th, again that is our best estimate based on models and projections,' Cox said. 'As far as when every smoking stump may be extinguished, that could be weeks if not months.'\n\nThere have been no deaths reported in the Kincade Fires however two first responders have been hospitalized due to burns, officials said. Cox said one person suffered a serious burn injury and was flown to UC Davis Medical Center and a second person was treated at a local hospital for a minor burn.\n\nAn Illinois couple who got married in Sonoma County in Northern California, in the midst of Kincade\u2019s fury, posed for a dramatic wedding portrait on Saturday wearing masks.\n\nThis NASA photo released Tuesday from NASA's Terra satellite shows the massive smoke plume cascading down California's coast from the devastating Kincade Fire in Sonoma County which has grown past 74,000 acres\n\nIllinois couple Katie and Curtis Ferland, who got married in Sonoma County in Northern California in the midst of Kincade\u2019s fury, posed for a dramatic wedding portrait on Saturday wearing masks as the inferno blazed just miles away\n\nWedding photographer Karna Roa of KMR Photography took the poignant of the newlyweds Katie and Curtis Ferland, of Chicago, who got married at the Chateau St. Jean Winery in Kenwood as the Kincade Fire burned just miles away.\n\n'The whole area, of course, was super smoky,' Roa said to Fox. 'I would love to say this is the first time it has happened, but this is the third year in a row in October that wine country has experienced this.'\n\nThe perilous winds led Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. to enforce a blackout starting early Tuesday that will cut power for 596,000 customers - about 1.5million people - spanning 29 Northern California counties, according to Fox News.\n\nFILE - In this Nov. 9, 2018 file photo Wind-driven flames from a wildfire race up a slope and cross the road in Malibu, Calif. known as the Woolsey Fire, it has consumed tens of thousands of acres and destroyed multiple homes.
