Still inside \u2013 more details to come. https://t.co/fHhqkZ6x3Z \u2014 Rep. Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) October 23, 2019\n\nTheir leader, Florida Man Matt Gaetz, claims he organized the stunt in an effort to force the members of the committee investigating a series of whistleblower complaints to open their process up to all members of congress. In essence, Gaetz is demanding the House turn its legal inquiry into the President\u2019s alleged high crimes into a public trial.\n\nThe House inquiry involves both Republicans and Democrats and isn\u2019t required or meant to be a public hearing. It\u2019s held in a secure location because key witnesses and pieces of top secret evidence are examined by the formal, appointed committee in order to determine whether the sitting president should be impeached. These are serious proceedings with potentially devastating consequences.\n\nWhat\u2019s important here is that the proceedings take place in a secure location. Called a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), these rooms are specially designed for senstive proceedings and have very strict protocols, including a ban on electronic devices.\n\nSecurity expert Mieke Eoyang, who worked at an SCIF handling related issues, tweeted about the national security risks:\n\nStorming the SCIF without respecting the security protocols that require people to leave their electronic devices *outside* the space, is actually compromising our national security. \u2014 Mieke Eoyang (@MiekeEoyang) October 23, 2019\n\nEverything said within the confines of that room is considered extremely sensitive. If any other country \u2013 adversary or ally \u2013 gained access to the conversations held in that room, it would give them an inconceivable advantage against the US.\n\nWhen Gaetz and his colleagues decided to breach protocol and introduce electronic devices into this room, the very best case scenario is that it was all in good faith. If we assume every single member of the allegedly 30-deep crew of Republicans who did so are good actors, then the taxpayers merely shoulder the burden of an hours-long delay while security teams sweep the room and debrief the individuals who broke protocol.\n\nBut what if one of them isn\u2019t playing straight? Or what if one of them is a patsy who unknowingly trafficked a listening device into the room? What if we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know? Because all we do know is that a group of people planned and executed a well-timed scheme to surprise and disrupt what\u2019s arguably the most important Congressional proceedings in decades.\n\nThat these politicians aren\u2019t getting an NSA grilling right now is a testament to just how bizarre US politics have become. It\u2019s hard to imagine any other time in our nation\u2019s history that a DoD official\u2019s testimony to a House committee in a secure facility would be interrupted by internal activists without repercussion. It appears even national security must take a backseat to the Trump show.\n\nRead next: Elon Musk: Tesla\u2019s full self-driving mode could arrive before the year's end", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fgaetz.jpg&signature=83af0fb78304daf9c55c4f9c088a45e4", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
