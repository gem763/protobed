According to the filed complaint obtained by Vulture, De Niro created a hostile work environment with unwanted physical contact, sexually charged comments, verbal abuse, and gendered stereotyping. Examples of harassment from the suit include suggesting Robinson should get pregnant using a married male co-worker\u2019s sperm, jokes about his Viagra prescription, lashing out at Robinson while he was intoxicated, urinating while on the phone with her, and asking her to \u201cimagine him on the toilet.\u201d The law firm has published a voicemail from De Niro to its client, in which he calls Robinson a \u201cspoiled fucking brat\u201d and yells at her for not answering his call.\n\nIn August, De Niro\u2019s Canal Productions sued Robinson for $6 million, accusing her of spending \u201castronomical amounts of time\u201d watching Netflix on the job (her faves included Friends, Schitt\u2019s Creek, and Arrested Development), using his frequent-flier miles, and charging expensive lunches from places like Paola and Dean & DeLuca to the company card. Robinson\u2019s complaint alleges De Niro filed his lawsuit only to retaliate against her for speaking up and to \u201cfalsely characterize Ms. Robinson as a loafer, a thief, and a miscreant.\u201d CGI de-aging can\u2019t send you back in time to fix this mess, Bob.", "description": "Actor Robert De Niro\u2019s former employee is suing him for gender discrimination and harassment just a few months after he sued her for embezzlement.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/03/03-deniro.w1200.h630.jpg"}
