(Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe International Judo Federation on Wednesday banned Iranian athletes from its events over the country\u2019s policy to boycott matches with Israeli participants.\n\nThe move comes after one of Iran\u2019s top judoka said he was pressured not to advance beyond the semifinals at the World Judo Championships in August to avoid facing an Israeli fighter. Saeid Mollaei walked off the team after he said he was pressured not to defeat Belgian Matthias Casse in a semifinal and went into hiding in Germany with the help of the IJF. The organization said the pressure on Mollaei was \u201cin gross contradiction\u201d with a letter in which Iran\u2019s judo federation agreed to respect the Olympic Charter. The IJF told the Iranian federation it had 21 days to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n\nA story on the federation\u2019s website suggested Mollaei could compete at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics without representing Iran; the Associated Press reported that the IJF is exploring the possibility of Mollaei competing on the IOC\u2019s team of refugees.\n\nThe Israeli government applauded the ban and said action from international sports organizations has been years in the making.\n\n\u201cFor far too long countries like Iran prefer to sabotage their excellent athletes, demanding they give up their dreams for the country\u2019s relentless effort to delegitimatize Israel,\u201d Elad Strohmayer, a spokesman for the Israeli embassy in Washington, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd and cruel, and it\u2019s commendable that the International Judo Federation is finally addressing it.\u201d\n\nA representative from the Iranian mission at the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. The president of Iran\u2019s judo federation told a semi-official Iranian news agency that the suspension was \u201chasty and unfair,\u201d according to the AP.\n\nThe Iranian team will be allowed to compete at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo because the Iranian Olympic Committee, not the judo federation, sponsors the athletes. Only the judo federation faces the suspension.\n\n[Iran held him captive for 544 days. Now he\u2019s rooting for its World Cup team.]\n\nIran, which doesn\u2019t formally recognize Israel as a country, has for decades forbid its athletes to compete against Israeli opponents. That has led to repeated controversies about violations of the Olympic Charter, which prohibits \u201cdiscrimination of any kind, such as race, color, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\u201d\n\nIn May, ahead of the world championships, the Iranian National Olympic Committee wrote to IJF leaders pledging the Islamic Republic would \u201cfully respect the Olympic Charter and its nondiscrimination principle.\u201d The IJF hailed the decision as \u201chistoric,\u201d and Mollaei and Israeli judoka Sagi Muki appeared on a course to meet in the world championship as the top-ranked fighters in their weight class.\n\nBut before Mollaei\u2019s quarterfinal bout against Khasan Khalmurzaev of Russia, the 2016 Olympic gold medalist, on Aug. 28, the Iranian first deputy minister of sport called the Iranian team coach and told him to withdraw Mollaei from the match, according to the IJF\u2019s account.\n\nMollaei fought anyway, and won the bout. Before his next event, according to the IJF, an Iranian diplomatic delegation arrived at the venue and Iranian Olympic committee president Reza Salehi Amiri called with a thinly veiled threat: Iranian security forces were at his parents\u2019 home.\n\nHe lost the match against Casse \u2014 \u201cI could not compete because of the law in my country, and because I was scared of consequences for my family and myself,\u201d he said, according to the IJF \u2014 and then lost the bronze medal bout to Georgia\u2019s Luka Maisuradze.\n\n[Banned from men\u2019s soccer matches in Iran, these women dressed as men to sneak in]\n\n\u201cToday, the National Olympic Committee of Iran and the Sport Minister told me to not compete, that I had to comply with the law,\u201d Mollaei said afterward, according to the federation. \u201cI am a fighter. I want to compete wherever I can. I live in a country whose law does not permit me to. We have no choice, all athletes must comply with it. All I did today was for my life, for a new life.\u201d\n\n\n\nIranian judoka Saeid Mollaei poses for a portrait photo at an undisclosed southern city of Germany where he has been in hiding since he left the Iranian judo team last month. (Michael Probst)\n\nIran\u2019s ban on competition with Israeli athletes dates to the 1979 Islamic revolution, said Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, when the new nonsecular government used anti-Israel and anti-Western sentiment to whip up popular support.\n\nBut now 40 years later, the rabid anti-Israel and anti-West movement has faded, he said, even as the government continues to push the same diplomatic strategy that has isolated Iran in global politics.\n\n\u201cHere is a young, successful athlete whose had his career ruined because of the foreign policy,\u201d Vatanka said. \u201cBut you have thousands of young men like him walking around Iran looking for employment and wondering, \u2018Why am I where I am economically? Why can\u2019t I find a job?\u2019 It\u2019s a regime that has a foreign policy that has an impact way outside of sports.\u201d\n\nAlready this month, Iranian sports fans were confronted with the death of a young woman by self-immolation outside a courthouse in Tehran.

He said the Iranian people \u201cdon\u2019t hate us [Israelis].\" He called the Iranian government \u201cextreme.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have two dreams,\u201d he said. \u201cOne is to win the gold medal at the Olympics. But I also dream to face Mollaei, and it doesn\u2019t matter who wins. I want to shake his hand, give him a hug. This way, we will not only show honor for each other, but together we can show that sport is above everything else.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA \u2018College Game Day\u2019 sign asked for beer money.
