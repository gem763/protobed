Yet despite the continued controversy surrounding its director, that film also met with highly positive reviews.\n\nPolanski did not travel to the festival to promote the drama, nor did he attend the closing night ceremony to pick up his prize.\n\nLuca Marinelli won best actor for Martin Eden, and Ariane Ascaride took the best actress prize for the the French domestic drama Gloria Mundi.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Comic book movie starring Joaquin Phoenix takes top award and An Officer and a Spy wins grand jury prize", "authors": ["Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/724d1b4198854d8ddbb73b2db2355ed5fcaff856/0_129_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=17b0f3da0c8cd7bb5e89d8a0d3580387", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
