The results were adjusted for age, gender, Type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, smoking and cholesterol levels.\n\n\u2018Morning ingestion has been the most common recommendation by physicians.\u2019 \u2014 Ram\u00f3n Hermida, director of the Bioengineering and Chronobiology Labs at the University of Vigo, Spain\n\nThe researchers found that patients who took their medication at bedtime reduced by 45% their risk of dying from or suffering heart attacks, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure or requiring a procedure to unblock narrowed arteries, compared to those who took their medication after waking up in the morning.\n\nThe risk of death from heart or blood vessel problems was reduced by 66%, the risk of myocardial infarction was reduced by 44%, coronary revascularization (unblocking narrowed arteries) by 40%, heart failure by 42%, and stroke by 49%. However, the researchers noted there are no studies showing that treating hypertension in the morning reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n\u201cMorning ingestion has been the most common recommendation by physicians based on the misleading goal of reducing morning blood pressure levels,\u201d said co-author Ram\u00f3n Hermida, director of the Bioengineering and Chronobiology Labs at the University of Vigo in Spain. Allowing the medication to work before the next day\u2019s activity may also play a role.\n\nPreventative measures in early adulthood include taking statins \u2014 lipid-lowering drugs \u2014 and drugs to lower cholesterol, which can be more effective than merely relying on diet and exercise, particularly for those who have a genetic predisposition to high cholesterol and elevated blood pressure, experts say.\n\nYou may also like: Taking these two health precautions now can dramatically reduce your risk of heart disease later in life\n\nBetween 2008 and 2018, 10,614 male and 8,470 female adults of Caucasian Spanish origin who were diagnosed with hypertension had to adhere to a routine of daytime activity and night-time sleep. Hermida said it\u2019s not possible to know whether the results apply to people who work night shifts or those from other racial/ethnic backgrounds.\n\nOne possible theory for the results: A bad night\u2019s sleep can result in a spike in blood pressure that night and the following day, separate research found. That study, published in a recent edition of the journal Psychosomatic Medicine, offers one explanation for why sleep problems have been shown to increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and even death from cardiovascular disease.\n\nThose participants who had lower \u201csleep efficiency\u201d showed an increase in blood pressure during that restless night. They also had higher systolic blood pressure \u2014 the number in a person\u2019s blood-pressure reading \u2014 the next day. The researchers said getting good sleep and quality sleep was important for a healthy heart. It also allows medications to work while the body is restoring energy.\n\n\u2018Blood pressure is one of the best predictors of cardiovascular health.\u2019 \u2014Caroline Doyle, a graduate student at the University of Arizona\u2019s department of psychology\n\n\u201cBlood pressure is one of the best predictors of cardiovascular health,\u201d said lead study author Caroline Doyle, a graduate student at the University of Arizona\u2019s department of psychology. Cardiovascular disease is the No. 1 killer of people in the country. \u201cWe wanted to see if we could try to get a piece of that story: how sleep might be impacting disease through blood pressure.\u201d\n\nThere are other ways to help reduce hypertension. A diet that helps people reduce high blood pressure may also reduce the risk of heart failure in people under the age of 75, according to separate research recently published in the latest edition of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.\n\nThis \u201cDash\u201d (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet recommends eating fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, poultry, fish and low-fat dairy products, while reducing the amount of salt, red meat, sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages, full cream and alcohol in your diet. Aside from the last two items, it\u2019s very similar to the Mediterranean diet.", "description": "The trial instructed 19,084 patients to take their pills on waking or at bedtime, and followed them for more than six years.", "authors": ["Quentin Fottrell", "Personal Finance Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GJ319_boomer_ZG_20180516142545.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
