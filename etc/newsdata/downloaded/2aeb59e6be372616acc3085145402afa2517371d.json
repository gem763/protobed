The book offers a simple definition. \u201cPlatforms, in general, connect individuals and organizations for a common purpose or to share a common resource.\u201d Examples include Airbnb Inc., Google search and Facebook Inc.\u2019s social network.\n\nPlatforms are all about network effects. The more products or services a platform offers, the more users it will attract, helping it then attract more offerings, which in turn brings in more users, which then makes the platform even more valuable. Moreover, the larger the network, the more data is available to customize offerings to user preferences and better match supply and demand, further increasing the platform\u2019s value.\n\nA platform strategy differs from a product strategy in that it relies on an external ecosystem to generate complementary innovations and/or business transactions. The potential for innovation and growth is therefore higher than what can be achieved by one company focused on products.\n\nAnd yet platform companies fail at an alarming rate. The reasons are numerous. After all, startups fail all the time. But the authors found four common mistakes that lead to failures: mispricing; lack of trust with users and partners; prematurely dismissing the competition; and entering too late.\n\nMispricing. \u201cThe biggest business challenges for platforms are to nurture network effects and then translate the momentum and value created into a steady and growing stream of revenue and profits,\u201d the authors write.\n\nKickstarting these network effects generally requires underwriting one side of the market to encourage the other side to participate. Think of Amazon.com Inc. subsidizing two-day shipping to attract buyers and sellers to its marketplace, while consistently losing money or earning meager profits for its first several years as a public company, much to Wall Street\u2019s displeasure. It\u2019s not surprising that so many platform companies, especially transaction ones, run out of money before their network effects achieve liftoff.\n\nMistrust. While getting the price right is necessary for success, it\u2019s not sufficient. Platforms require two or more parties who generally don\u2019t know each other to connect. \u201cIn such a world, building trust is essential,\u201d the authors write.\n\nThe book cites the example of eBay China, which had a dominant share in e-commerce in the early 2000s. As was the case in the U.S., eBay China relied on PayPal as its payment system. But Chinese consumers didn\u2019t have the kind of banking and credit-card relationships that underpin PayPal in the U.S. and other advanced economies. Enter Alibaba. Unlike PayPal, its Alipay payment system was based on an escrow model that didn\u2019t release payment until the consumer was satisfied. This enabled Alibaba to quickly capture the bulk of the e-commerce market in China, forcing eBay Inc. to withdraw despite its first-mover advantage.\n\nHubris. Prematurely dismissing the competition is another common mistake. There\u2019s no question that first movers often have an advantage, and once the market tips in their favor they are likely to be the long-run winner. \u201cBut there is a better way to think about tipper markets: it is the winner\u2019s opportunity to lose. Hubris, along with overconfidence and arrogance, to name a few misdirected traits, can produce spectacular failures.\u201d\n\nMistiming. \u201cPerhaps the most classic platform mistake is mistiming the market.\u201d The book illustrates this last mistake with the smartphone sector. For years in the early 2000s, Microsoft Corp. tried to recreate its Windows PC leadership with Windows Mobile and Windows Phone. But despite billions of investments, including the acquisition of Nokia\u2019s mobile division in 2013, Microsoft eventually withdrew from the smartphone market. \u201cEntering the business five years after Apple, and three years after Google, meant that Microsoft missed the platform window and never recovered.\u201d\n\nMany things can go wrong in a platform market because there are so many moving parts.\n\n\u201cFirms not only have to coordinate internal operations, a supply chain, and novel methods of distribution,\" the authors say. \"They also have to manage complements, overcome chicken-or-egg problems, and simultaneously stimulate multiple sides of a market\u2026.Despite the huge upside opportunities that platforms offer, pursuing a platform strategy does not necessarily improves the odds of success as a business.\u201d\n\nIrving Wladawsky-Berger worked at IBM from 1970 to 2007, and has been a strategic adviser to Citigroup, HBO and Mastercard and a visiting professor at Imperial College.
