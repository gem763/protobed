While Kim stuck to her usual style of black gown - by Vivienne Westwood though, rather than Versace - Kendall mixed it up in a red floral Richard Quinn dress, layered over a black, very shiny polo neck top.\n\nTake a look yourself:\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter has been laying into poor Kendall for the look, with many pointing out how, um, sweaty she must be under all that black latex.\n\nKendall Jenner\u2019s ensemble looks like when you get the sex toys almost hidden in the sofa because your mom dropped by unannounced. #Emmys \u2014 Emerson Collins (@ActuallyEmerson) September 23, 2019\n\nKendall Jenner\u2019s Emmy dress looks like the prom dress every girl wanted at junior prom but lubricated \u2014 anne \ud83d\udc18 (@Styles_Anne_) September 23, 2019\n\nWhile I don\u2019t agree with the tweet, I have to say..... what the actual efff is Kendall wearing? She looking like she might need to dominate her prom date after the dance and just wore it under her dress to save time. https://t.co/u7vOO62vMh \u2014 Allie (@thatgirl__allie) September 23, 2019\n\nMe when I saw Kendall Jenner\u2019s dress: https://t.co/wviwdbuglK \u2014 Maryam \u2728 (@Reemy_alhamad) September 23, 2019\n\nKendall Jenner serving Alice in Bondageland with that latex + floral getup #Emmys pic.twitter.com/LxUDdhT8xr \u2014 Cooper Jackson (@cooperjackson) September 22, 2019\n\nNot that she cares, I guess. Kendall was working the camera all the way down the red carpet, and we have to give her serious props for being a style chameleon.\n\nThis time last week she fooled us all into thinking she'd gone blonde, after she walked the Burberry runway with a new lighter hairdo. But, since she's rocking a slicked-back style in her usual dark colour at the Emmys, we'd guess it was just a wig.\n\nCan't wait to see what look she pulls out of the bag next.\n\nFollow Abbi on Instagram.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "It looks kinda sweaty tbh", "authors": ["Abigail Malbon"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GpNv0IhnIIP.vSm6GTr6bA--~B/aD0zNDA7dz02ODA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/1f69f0bb84078db5ede02553d8404ed3", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
