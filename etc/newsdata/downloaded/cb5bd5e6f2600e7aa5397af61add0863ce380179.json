We need to talk about that.", "language": "en", "text": "As for his lack of transparency about his heart event, \u201cThat\u2019s nonsense,\u201d Sanders told NBC News. He said he wasn\u2019t about to run to the New York Times and decant his medical condition every 15 minutes\u2014even though nobody was asking for that sort of granularity. \u201cI think we acted absolutely appropriately,\u201d he said.\n\nBut feel free to question Sanders\u2019 capacity to judge the status of his own health\u2014if only because he does. \u201cI must confess, I was dumb,\u201d Sanders said on Tuesday. \u201cI, in the last month or two, just was more fatigued than I usually have been. And I should have listened to those symptoms.\u201d\n\nNow that Sanders is listening to his symptoms, he should let us eavesdrop, too, or at least get a full readout of his health from his doctors so his supporters can glean a stronger sense of whether he\u2019ll survive his potential term in office or whether his health will trigger 25th Amendment action should heart disease strike him again.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jack Shafer"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
