So, AirPods Pro, wipe that mucus off your shiny plastic and say hello to the world.\n\nIf you\u2019re here looking for general information and specs on the new true wireless earbuds, I\u2019d recommend you check out this article. This piece is looking at something different: the clever branding Apple has undertaken with the AirPods Pro.\n\nNow, when the second generation of AirPods (colloquially known as AirPods 2) were announced in March of this year, I was disappointed. Yeah, there was an improvement in battery life, a new chip (gotta love that sweet H1, right?), and Siri support, but the whole thing felt like an iterative upgrade; an AirPods 1.5 if you like, not the next generation of Apple\u2018s earbuds \u2014 something I pointed out and discussed at the time.\n\nHonestly, it felt like a weird move.\n\nGenerally, Apple makes huge hardware strides across the first few iterations of its products. I mean, just consider the evolution of the iPod, iPhone, and Apple Watch over their first couple of generations. Seeing the second version of the AirPods (or AirPods 2 if you prefer) being so similar to the original models didn\u2019t feel particularly Apple.\n\nBut with the release of the AirPods Pro, things finally make a bit more sense. Rather than releasing an iterative AirPods upgrade \u2014 you know, like the Apple Watch Series 3 to Series 4 for example \u2014 the introduction of a Pro model gives Apple the chance to have its cake and eat it.\n\nOr, to put it differently, make a shit ton of cash.\n\nAs much as I like the look of AirPods Pro, I\u2019m not a huge fan of this chode case.\n\nThe AirPods Pro are the true wireless earbuds we wanted the second generation AirPods to be. They\u2019re packed with new tech, have a fresh design, and feel way more in line with other true wireless earbuds at the premium end of the market.\n\nBut, by naming them the AirPods Pro (instead of the AirPods 3, I guess), Apple has simultaneously kept its older earbuds relevant to the wider public, while still selling to the upgrade-mad amongst us. And that\u2019s not even discussing the interest the AirPods Pro will get from the audiophile community, who were, in the main, put off by the original pairs.\n\nIf the latest earbuds were named the AirPods 3, that immediately makes the second generation AirPods feel outdated. But with Pro moniker, it positions them as a different sort of earbud. Effectively, this doubles people\u2019s purchasing options.\n\nHell, I can imagine folks buying a set of both standard and Pro AirPods, something I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d do if it was just an ascending number system.\n\nThe genius in the AirPods Pro naming convention is its simplicity. It\u2019s a dumb trick, but slapping on \u201cPro\u201d is successful because, basically, we\u2019re all stupid. It\u2019s why shops still sell items that end in \u201c.99.\u201d \u2014 we all know what they\u2019re doing, but it still works.\n\nThis is what the AirPod Pro would look like if you had CRAZY X-RAY VISION.\n\nBefore we finish, it\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t discuss the differences between the \u201cPro\u201d moniker on the iPhones and AirPods.\n\nWhile they both serve a similar function on the surface (i.e. letting users that these are the premium devices), there\u2019s one key thing that separates them: the iPhones bearing the Pro badge were all released at the same time. This means the \u201cPro\u201d moniker is solely used to differentiate the phones, making it easier for the consumer to decide which is right for them.\n\nThe AirPods 2 and AirPods Pro, on the other hand, were released over 6 months apart. This makes me feel that they\u2019re the next evolution of the true wireless earbuds, not a related category, like an iPad Mini or a Plus iPhone.\n\nBut Apple has obviously looked at the sales of the classic AirPods and found a way to release a new pair that won\u2019t cannibalize the sales of the old. All with that single word.\n\nThis image shows how you can change volume, and select noise-cancelation and transparency modes.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, the AirPods Pro are really the proper AirPods 2. They\u2019re the upgrade to the original product. They\u2019re the outcome of Apple\u2018s drastic improvement of its new hardware. They\u2019re the true wireless earbuds we were waiting for.\n\nBut, by calling them the AirPods Pro, and not positioning them as an iterative update, Apple has kept the second generation AirPods relevant. Just in time for Christmas too. That, friends, is a pro move.\n\nThis post includes affiliate links to products that you can buy online.
