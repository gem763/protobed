I just went for the first one that I felt alright in. I\u2019ve been to try it on again and I hate it.\"\n\n(Image: Say Yes To The Dress Lancashire)\n\nBut this has led to serious consquences for both her and her groom.\n\nMel added: \"If I don\u2019t find a dress today then I can\u2019t walk down the aisle.\"\n\nTo make matters worse Sara, who is tasked with helping Mel find the perfect gown, admits she's super opinionated.\n\nArriving at the Ava Rose Hamilton boutique, she said: \"My role today is speak my mind, tell her the truth, because I don\u2019t think anybody else will.\n\n\"I can\u2019t keep my gob shut when I think something looks a mess.\"\n\n(Image: Say Yes To The Dress Lancashire)\n\nTo get the ball rolling, Gok gets Mel to try on a gorgeous lace fishtail dress, but the bride has some surprising reservations.\n\nShe says: \"It\u2019s not what I expected but my heart is pounding out of my chest because I just know full well when I go downstairs there\u2019s going to be some kind of negativity.\"\n\nSara certainly doesn't let her down and makes a cutting comment as soon as she sees her friend in the frock.\n\nShe says: \"Right, how can I put this without being awfu? Your stomach is really flat in it, it\u2019s not about your stomach.\n\n\"But behind I can see dimples in your legs and your bum.\"\n\n(Image: Say Yes To The Dress Lancashire)\n\n(Image: Say Yes To The Dress Lancashire)\n\nDesperate to relieve the tension, Gok insists he can't see any dimples - but sara definitely disagrees.\n\nShe says: \"It\u2019s not shocking but I\u2019m just telling you that\u2019s what I can see. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s ever met anyone as vocal as me.\"\n\nThankfully Gok sees the funny side.\n\nWorried Mel asks: \"It\u2019s all turned into my dimply bum and not about the dress,.\"\n\nShe then asks if she has any back fat in the gown - and Sara once again replies with a brutal observation.\n\n(Image: Say Yes To The Dress Lancashire)\n\n(Image: Say Yes To The Dress Lancashire)\n\nShe says: \"I don\u2019t think your bra helps.\"\n\nGok desperately tries to salvage the situation, although he has a mammoth task ahead of him.\n\nHe says: \"What I\u2019ve got to do now is cover dimples, show the body off, cover the boobs, and find a dress that is available in 71 days.\"\n\nHe picks a stunning, intricately laced, backless dress that suits Mel down to a tee. \u201cI love it - and thankfully Mel loves it.\n\nShe says: \"There\u2019s no dimples there. That feeling in the pit of my stomach has completely changed.\"\n\nBut they still have to get the gown past Sara.\n\nThis time, Mel, Sara and everyone else are in tears of happiness.\n\nSara says: \"I can\u2019t actually believe that her dress has made me cry.\"", "description": "Mel has just 71 days before her big day - but there's one thing standing in the way of her happy ever after", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "Say Yes To The Dress Lancashire"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20724518.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Say-Yes-To-The-Dress-Lancashire.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
