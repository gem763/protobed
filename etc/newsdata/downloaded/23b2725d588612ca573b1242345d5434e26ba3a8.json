The policy was intended to give popular users a better experience, incentivizing them to stay on the platform.\n\n\u201cHistorically, users with high follower counts have seen fewer ads,\u201d a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement to The Verge. \u201cRecently, we\u2019ve shifted our approach to showing ads to everyone who uses Twitter and as a result, some will notice an increase in the number of ads they\u2019re seeing.\u201d\n\nSome Twitter users had already noticed the shift. For weeks, popular users have been complaining about seeing more ads on the platform. That was likely the result of the changed policy, which previously suppressed the number of ads shown to those high-follower accounts. Now, the company has leveled the playing field. As a result, popular accounts are seeing more ads, finally experiencing what it\u2019s like to be a plebe on the platform.\n\n\u201cHistorically, users with high follower counts have seen fewer ads.\u201d\n\nThe revelation comes on the heels of a low earnings announcement that the company is blaming on issues with its advertising products, including some alarming data management practices. Twitter normally asks users\u2019 permission to share information on their device type, Wi-Fi connection, and operating system. But the setting wasn\u2019t working properly, and the information ended up going to advertisers when it shouldn\u2019t have.\n\nNow, that problem is fixed, which is good for humanity but bad for the company\u2019s bottom line since advertisers want to target valuable users who are more likely to spend money on their products. Twitter is still working on a more long-term fix and says the problems could bleed into next quarter.\n\n\u201cAlthough we are working on remediation, there isn\u2019t remediation yet in place, so the effects of that will continue into Q4,\u201d the company\u2019s chief financial officer Ned Segal told CNBC. \u201cAs you can imagine, the remediation would be sharing aggregated data as opposed to personalized data when people have asked us not to share data.\u201d", "description": "Twitter has a history of working to appease high profile people on the platform.
