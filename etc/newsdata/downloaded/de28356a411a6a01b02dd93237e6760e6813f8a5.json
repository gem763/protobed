Jennifer Wexton (@RepWexton) October 22, 2019\n\nThe Democratic representative has previously quarreled with Carson, decrying a new HUD policy rolled out earlier this year which allowed federally funded homeless shelters to turn away transgender people on religious grounds, a move she called \u201cincredibly dangerous.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com No laughing matter: PC policing would make \u2018Monty Python\u2019 and other comedies \u2018crimes\u2019 today\n\nCarson has been something of an anti-PC warrior for years, well before the highly politically incorrect president entered the Oval Office in 2016, regularly shredding the concept in media appearances and warning of \u201ca society where people are afraid to say what they actually believe\u201d \u2013 at times even drawing comparisons to Nazi Germany.\n\nLike this story?
