Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack, but U.S. and Saudi officials doubt that claim and stress, as Pompeo did, that it has \u201cthe fingerprints of the ayatollah\u201d \u2014 a reference to Iran\u2019s supreme leader.\n\nWhen pressed by reporters traveling with him about the efficacy of Trump\u2019s current approach, Pompeo said something he perhaps didn\u2019t quite intend. \u201cI would argue that what you are seeing here is a direct result of us reversing the enormous failure of the JCPOA,\u201d he said, using the official acronym for the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers that Trump opted to leave.\n\nPompeo was hailing Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign on the Iranians that has strangled the country\u2019s oil exports and inflicted deep economic pain. But he also seemed to be linking the White House\u2019s reneging of American commitments to the nuclear deal to the current veil of hostilities hanging over the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe regime in #Iran is the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terror. The Trump administration\u2019s maximum pressure campaign is working; the campaign will continue as long as the Iranian regime pursues its destabilizing behavior. pic.twitter.com/v2hwvyDCfa \u2014 Department of State (@StateDept) September 18, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s a view held both by U.S. allies in Europe and analysts in Washington. \u201cHaving upended the nuclear agreement in pursuit of a bigger, better bargain with Iran \u2014 whose leaders are clearly disinclined to sit back and accept the U.S. economic onslaught quietly \u2014 Trump has ignited the forces of chaos and conflict that the deal was meant to contain,\u201d wrote Suzanne Maloney of the Brookings Institution.\n\nPompeo left the Middle East on Thursday insisting that the United States and its allies were still focused on a \u201cpeaceful resolution\u201d of the current crisis. The White House\u2019s main response to last weekend\u2019s attack on a major facility operated by Saudi oil giant Aramco was an announcement of further sanctions on the already heavily sanctioned Iranian regime. Just days before world leaders gather in New York at the United Nations, there was little indication the Trump administration was plotting a concerted military response to Iran\u2019s perceived aggression.\n\nAs my colleague Anne Gearan wrote earlier this week, Trump is walking a seemingly contradictory line. On one hand, he routinely rattles his saber at Iran and has applied sanctions even more asphyxiating than what the Obama administration mustered in its bid to force Iran to the table years ago. On the other hand, Trump\u2019s vow of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d belies his own stated desire to disentangle the United States from protracted conflicts in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cTrump is caught between a political imperative to confront Iran \u2014 pleasing hawkish Republican supporters and allies Israel and Saudi Arabia \u2014 and his own political instincts against foreign intervention and toward cutting a deal,\u201d wrote Gearan. \u201cBut uncertainty over where Trump stands has complicated every other foreign policy challenge the United States faces in the Middle East, unnerved Israel and helped push out the administration\u2019s leading Iran hawk, former national security adviser John Bolton.\u201d\n\nThe Iranians, who consistently blamed figures like Bolton for Trump\u2019s confrontational agenda, seemed to have called the White House\u2019s bluff. \u201cIn May, Iran\u2019s leaders again concluded that countering American pressure required aggressive action that would change the cost-benefit calculus for Washington and the world,\u201d Maloney wrote for The Washington Post. \u201cIran calculated that pushing back against the United States by targeting its allies and interests would generate diplomatic leverage that could be used in any future negotiations, inject urgency among world powers and dissuade its neighbors from cooperating with Washington\u2019s pressure campaign.\u201d\n\nThat seems to have been borne out by developments in the Persian Gulf, where even staunch U.S. allies such as the United Arab Emirates have, out of necessity, taken a more cautious, mollifying approach to Iran than the Trump administration. \u201cEuropean states that joined U.S. operations to secure the Persian Gulf in the past are very reluctant to do so now, because they fear Trump will drag them into a war,\u201d noted The Post\u2019s editorial board. \u201cEven some of Iran\u2019s foremost adversaries don\u2019t want a conflict with Iran presided over by an erratic and unstable U.S. president, who already canceled one military strike at the last minute.\u201d\n\nTheodore Karasik, a senior adviser at Washington-based Gulf State Analytics, pointed to the unpredictability of \u201cthe typical Trump zigzag policy.\u201d Even as Trump insists he\u2019s willing to meet Iran\u2019s leaders, it\u2019s impossible to \u201crule out\u201d a possible military escalation, Karasik told Today\u2019s WorldView, adding that \u201cwar is already being waged by nontraditional means, including exchanges of cyberattacks.\u201d\n\nThe trouble right now is that there\u2019s no obvious track for diplomacy, and that\u2019s a view shared both in Washington and Tehran. The \u201cTrump administration\u2019s approach toward the Islamic Republic has amounted to a confused and incoherent strategy,\u201d wrote Alireza Saedi, who sits on the executive board of Iran\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. He added that \u201ca comprehensive agreement that will definitively resolve the long-standing conflict between Iran and the United States still seems far from within reach.\u201d\n\nNext week\u2019s meetings at the United Nations are unlikely to serve as a space for rapprochement; both the Americans and Saudis are expected to air their grievances with the Iranians at the dais of the U.N. General Assembly. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has already instructed his proxies in President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif not to engage the United States in talks.\n\nDomestically, Iran\u2019s hard-liners will resist making any concessions to Washington and excoriate any Iranian official who does. \u201cNobody wants to be the individual who shows up holding the hand of the U.S. president and then has to go home and account for what he got out of that photo op,\u201d Alex Vatanka, an Iran expert at the Middle East Institute, told Today\u2019s WorldView.\n\nThe current course of provocation is risky, said Vatanka, but hard-liners may believe it\u2019s \u201can even worse risk to be seen to be willing to talk to Trump.\u201d In the wake of the attacks on a major Saudi oil installation, some in Iran have already concluded that Trump\u2019s bark is worse than his bite.\n\n\u201cHe is a not a lion,\u201d Ali Bigdeli, a political analyst in Tehran, said of Trump to the New York Times. \u201cHe is a rabbit.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
