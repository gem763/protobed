He said that Digital Turbine Inc. ( APPS ) , a speculative software company, has been around for a long time and has an exciting story, but investors may be late to the party. He recommended using limit orders and buying only after a sizable pullback.\n\nLet's check out the charts and indicators of APPS, which is a holding in TheStreet's Stocks Under $10 portfolio.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of APPS, below, we can see a significant mark-up in prices the past 12 months. After this kind of big rally it is not surprising to see prices pause or correct lower as early investors decide to nail down their big profits. Prices look like they have made a correction this month but that alone is not a reason to buy. Let's dig deeper.\n\nPrices are above the rising 50-day moving average line and tests of that line the past year have been buying opportunities. The 200-day moving average line has a bullish slope but at the end of August prices we extended above that indicator.\n\nThe trading volume has increased since November and that is a positive as more traders and investors have been attracted to the stock. The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a positive trend and tells us that buyers have been more aggressive. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator turned lower in the beginning of this month giving us a take profits sell signal.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of APPS, below, we can see that prices have soared the past three years. These are \"life changing\" returns, in my opinion, and early investors who have been \"seasoned\" by a few market cycles are thinking very hard about booking their gains.\n\nWe would like to think that a rally from $1.50 to $7.50 will be repeated but it probably won't be and the shame will be not capitalizing on those gains. Prices are still above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is bullish and trading volume has been heavy. The MACD oscillator has begun to narrow and we could see a bearish crossover in the weeks ahead.\n\nIn this very large Point and Figure chart of APPS, below, we can see that prices have met an upside price target and that there isn't any nearby support.\n\nBottom-line strategy: APPS needs either several weeks of sideways price action to form an upper level base to support further gains OR a correction to the $5.50 area to make the stock more attractive to new buyers.", "description": "Digital Turbine Needs to Correct Its Outsized Gains...APPS", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Digital Turbine Needs To Correct Its Outsized Gains", "Here'S What It Would Take To Make Apps More Attractive To New Buyers", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Timothy Collins", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Jonathan Heller", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/a4b23fae-a937-11e7-989a-6367a110eb2e.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
