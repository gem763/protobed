Here, Trystan Upstill speaks about Google News at the Google I/O conference in Mountain View, Calif., on May 8, 2018. (Jeff Chiu)\n\nGoogle and Facebook say they are racing to elevate quality journalism in the lead-up to the 2020 elections, but some fear the changes could have unintended consequences for news media.\n\nGoogle said this week that it is tweaking its algorithms and the guidelines for its human search quality raters in a manner that will allow original reporting \u2014 news discovered by the publication and not aggregated from another outlet \u2014 to obtain a higher ranking on its search pages and maintain that ranking for a longer time. That follows Facebook last month saying it would begin offering several major news outlets as much as $3 million a year to license headlines and previews of articles, according to the Wall Street Journal, for use in a new feature called News Tab that is curated in part by veteran news editors.\n\nBoth companies have also pledged $300 million to fund local journalism projects over a three-year period.\n\n[Why Facebook is giving $300 million for local journalism]\n\nStill, some in the news media are concerned that Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s efforts may actually prove to have less of a positive impact than the companies envision \u2014 and may even be detrimental.\n\n\u201cIf they want to have quality content for their users, which they say they want to have, they\u2019re going to have to come up with a more broadly sustainable business model for publishers than handing out candy every once in a while,\u201d said David Chavern of the News Media Alliance trade group, which represents 2,000 news organizations and has been critical of tech companies.\n\nMuch of the way news currently surfaces is due to algorithms, which have been trained to identify important news. But some signals that a story might be important \u2014 like lots of people sharing it or clicking on it \u2014 don\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s real news. And the systems can also be tricked.\n\n[\u2018Deepfakes,\u2019 deep pockets: Facebook spends $10 million on contest for detecting \u2018constantly evolving\u2019 videos]\n\nCritics have lambasted Google and Facebook for the role their platforms played in amplifying a Russian disinformation campaign around the 2016 presidential election, saying the companies were slow to identify the foreign interference and didn\u2019t do enough to point users toward quality journalism. With the 2020 election around the corner, the companies say they are working on how to better address fake news stories, deceptive social media accounts and deepfake videos powered by artificial intelligence.\n\nAt the same time, politicians including President Trump have accused Google, Facebook and other major tech companies of anti-conservative bias in the way the platforms surface news.\n\nWith the new changes, companies appear to be realizing that humans may need to play a bigger role in helping identify quality news.\n\nGoogle says its has instructed its human raters to prioritize news reports that display a high degree of skill, time and effort. To evaluate trustworthiness, raters are told that \u201cprestigious awards, such as the Pulitzer Prize award, or a history of high quality original reporting are strong evidence of positive reputation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how that will play out, particularly with local publications, which rarely have the resources to compete in national journalism contests but are often the only professional news source in a given area.\n\n[Here are the best and worst things that happened to journalism in 2018]\n\nIn response to questions about Facebook\u2019s approach to news, a spokesman referenced an internal memo about News Tab obtained by The Information, which stated that editors \u201cwill seek to promote the media outlet that first reported a particular news story, and additionally prioritize stories broken by local news outlets.\u201d Should the story be covered nationally or internationally, the human editors will then make subsequent decisions about the developments.\n\nEmployment in newspaper newsrooms has declined by nearly half since 2008 as readers turn to free news content and entertainment gleaned from platforms like Google and Facebook. Local news, in particular, has been hit by the collapsing news media ecosystem, with fewer customers willing to spend subscription dollars.\n\nWhile Chavern of the News Media Alliance trade group lauded Google and Facebook\u2019s $300 million commitments, he said it won\u2019t be enough to reinvigorate the news industry before the 2020 election. He also said that it is possible that the new approaches could discourage outlets from attributing or hat-tipping each other\u2019s reporting in an attempt to look the most \u201coriginal\u201d to the companies\u2019 algorithms.\n\n\u201cThe current algorithms punish investments and promote copying,\u201d said Chavern. \u201cThat\u2019s the baseline.\u201d", "description": "Google and Facebook are racing to elevate quality journalism in the lead-up to the 2020 elections, but some fear the changes could have unintended consequences for news media.", "authors": ["Marie C.
