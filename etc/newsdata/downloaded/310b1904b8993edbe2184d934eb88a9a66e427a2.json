Kamala Harris (D) is taking heat after a progressive health care activist shared a video of the 2020 presidential candidate laughing at an audience member referring to President Donald Trump's actions as \"mentally retarded.\" Instead of correcting the man and condemning the use of the word \"retarded,\" Harris agreed with what was said. \"Well said, well said,\" she replied.\n\nDuring a rally, a voter referred to Trump's actions as \"mentally retarded\", prompting @KamalaHarris to laugh and say, \"well said, well said.\"\n\n\n\nI hate amplifying content I know the right will seize on and twist for their own hypocritical gain, but this hurts my heart. #CripTheVote pic.twitter.com/aVQWtLFw30 \u2014 Kendally Brown (@kendallybrown) September 7, 2019\n\nThe health care activist, Kendally Brown, explained how Harris betrayed the disability community.\n\nUsing \"retarded\" as a slur and an insult is never, EVER \"well said\", @KamalaHarris, no matter who it's against and no matter the larger point being made. It's ALWAYS a betrayal of the disability community.\n\n\n\nWe need\u2014and expect\u2014better from you. #CripTheVote https://t.co/XCQmlcmPG3 \u2014 Kendally Brown (@kendallybrown) September 7, 2019\n\nCBS News political reporter Caitlin Huey Burns asked Harris about the encounter. And, naturally, Harris quickly backtracked.\n\n\"It's an incredibly offensive term. And as someone who has a long standing relationship of advocacy for our disability community \u2013 in fact, I have a whole proposal of policies that I have been working on for some time and we rolled out weeks ago,\" Harris told the reporter. \"It's offensive, and you would think that in the year 2019, people would have a much better understanding how hurtful a term like that can be \u2013 but also the history behind it, which is the history of really ignoring the needs and the realities and the capacity of our disabilities community.\"\n\nI just asked @KamalaHarris about someone at her event yesterday calling President Trump \u201cmentally retarded.\u201d She told me: \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly offensive term\u201d and she does not condone it, noting her disabilities plan. \u2014 Caitlin Huey-Burns (@CHueyBurns) September 7, 2019\n\n@KamalaHarris told me that \u201cin the year 2019, people should know it\u2019s hurtful.\u201d She said she did not hear him use the term. \u2014 Caitlin Huey-Burns (@CHueyBurns) September 7, 2019\n\nPosting video soon. Here is our exchange: pic.twitter.com/1VegOapc54 \u2014 Caitlin Huey-Burns (@CHueyBurns) September 7, 2019\n\nThe most interesting part though, is Harris claimed she didn't hear the man.\n\n\"I heard him talk about the other stuff. And then that came later. And it was not something that I really heard or processed,\" Harris told the reporter.\n\nI noted to Harris that she did not correct the man who used the term. Did she hear him? \u201cI heard him talk about the other stuff. And then that came later. And it was not something that I really heard or processed.\u201d \u2014 Caitlin Huey-Burns (@CHueyBurns) September 7, 2019\n\nIn the moment, Kamala probably thought it was a great idea to laugh and shrug off what the man in the audience said. Now she's apologetic because she was called out by someone on her own side. She's alienated people who might have otherwise supported her. If she didn't actually hear the guy like she said, she would have said that from the get go. The reporter wouldn't have had to ask her about it again. Not to mention it's hard to believe she didn't hear what was said. The entire audience laughed and agreed with the guy.\n\nBut keep on pandering, Kamala.", "description": "Oh snap..09/08/2019 7:40:09AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/152/615cf8af-21b1-4523-b7ab-e5dd6eacd4fe.png", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
