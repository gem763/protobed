Brent crude, the global gauge of oil prices, soared 13% to nearly $69 a barrel. If those moves held, they would mark some of the biggest intraday for crude in years and put oil at its highest level in months.\n\nAnalysts cautioned that prices likely will be volatile as trading volumes increase throughout the session and more details emerge about the disruption in Saudi Arabia, where attacks over the weekend knocked out 5.7 million barrels a day of production, or roughly 5% of the globe\u2019s output.\n\nA sustained spike in fuel prices could mark the latest threat to a world economy already under significant pressure from the U.S.-China trade war. It could also impact stocks in the U.S., where resilient consumer spending has helped lift major indexes near records. Higher energy prices can raise gas and heating bills, cutting into available income.\n\nSunday\u2019s moves followed weeks of listless trading in oil, prompting some analysts to say markets were overlooking the possibility of heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThis is what happens when somebody lights the spark,\u201d said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of crude oil and one of the most geopolitically volatile areas on the planet\u2026. They are the biggest exporting country.\u201d\n\nShortly before 6 p.m., Mr. Trump said on Twitter he was authorizing the release of crude from the SPR to keep markets well supplied if needed. Such releases have been rare historically and only used as a last resort. The president said the size of the release was yet to be determined. There are more than 600 million barrels in the SPR.\n\nGovernment-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco, expects to restore roughly a third of the lost crude output by Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported, potentially limiting some of the spike in oil prices moving forward, traders said.\n\nThe attacks targeted Abqaiq, a massive processing plant that is at the heart of Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy system. Analysts say the damage could potentially create a supply shortfall as the kingdom assess the damage and tries to avoid a sharp drop in exports.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest crude exporter could tap oil inventories and use other facilities to process crude, but analysts say the uncertainty created by the attack could lead to significantly higher fuel costs. While the U.S. has grown its shale production, limited export capacity could limit the industry\u2019s ability to respond to a large shortfall.\n\n\u201cThis is basically equivalent to taking the entire Permian Basin and having it produce nothing for days,\u201d said Rob Thummel, a senior portfolio manager who oversees energy assets at Tortoise Capital Advisors, referring to the prolific U.S. region that spans more than 75,000 square miles of West Texas and New Mexico. \u201cThe response here is key and how long it takes to come back.\u201d\n\nMr. Thummel said he wouldn\u2019t necessarily immediately add to investments in energy stocks first thing Monday given the number of unknowns about the disruption to Saudi output.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see this play out a little more,\u201d he said.\n\nHouthi rebels in Yemen backed by Iran claimed responsibility for the attacks, the latest in a series in recent months on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure. A Saudi-led coalition has fought for years to seize control in Yemen from the Houthis, who took control of the country\u2019s capital, San\u2019a, in 2014 during a civil war.\n\nThis weekend\u2019s incident stoked ongoing tensions between Iran and the U.S. and its ally Saudi Arabia. The U.S. blamed Iran for the attacks, a claim Tehran denied. U.S. and Saudi officials are also investigating whether they involved cruise missiles fired from Iraq or Iran, The Journal reported.\n\nThe uncertainty in the Middle East could force investors to brace for more possible disruptions to output, analysts said. U.S. crude ended last week up 21% for the year at about $55 barrel, though it was well below its April peaks and levels from a year ago on fears that softening demand would result in a supply glut.\n\nRecent declines in fuel prices have been a boon for large users of fuel and consumers who have paid less at the pump. U.S. consumers have continued to spend steadily in recent months, powering the economy despite a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. growth.\n\nAnalysts said more responses from developed nations that could tap their plentiful stockpiles of crude could soften some of the market\u2019s reaction. An inventory response could be necessary because the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has limited spare capacity, production that can be quickly turned on in an emergency, to handle what could be the industry\u2019s largest disruption in years.\n\nLarge buyers of Saudi Arabian oil in Asia such as China, Japan and India could also be impacted depending on how much fuel prices rise on the supply disruption.\n\n\u201cThese attacks make it even more difficult to protect these facilities, so there\u2019s a reason why a risk premium is likely to stay over the coming weeks,\u201d said Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at UBS Wealth Management.\n\nWrite to Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com", "description": "Crude prices surged following an attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure and announcement from President Trump that he has authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.", "authors": ["Amrith Ramkumar", "Amrith.Ramkumar Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107318/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
