Blitzchung had been competing in the online card game Hearthstone\u2019s Asia-Pacific Grandmasters when he made the comment.\n\nOn Tuesday, Blizzard suspended Blitzchung for a year and said he had forfeited approximately $10,000 in prize money won in the tournament up to that point, CBS News reported.\n\nBlizzard, the creator of such wildly successful games as World of Warcraft, Starcraft and Diablo, said in its statement that Blitzchung violated a competition rule against engaging in an act that \u201cbrings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter an investigation, we are taking the necessary actions to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe two individuals who interviewed Blitzchung on the broadcast were also fired, even though their actions \u2015 they hid their faces \u2015 suggested they were not aware of the gamer\u2019s planned protest. Blizzard did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost.\n\nHong Kong has been rocked for months as thousands of citizens have repeatedly flooded the streets in anti-government protests. What started as demonstrations against a proposed law on extradition to mainland China have widened into a pro-democracy movement against the Chinese government and its efforts to limit Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. Clashes between protesters and authorities have grown increasingly violent as the demonstrations have intensified, with a viral video from last week showing a Hong Kong police officer shooting a teenage protester in the chest.\n\nThe Chinese government recently banned face coverings on protesters. In an apparent reference to that, Blitzchung can be seen in the interview wearing a mask and a pair of goggles.\n\nAs CBS noted, Blizzard, a California-based company, is partly owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent.\n\nPublic criticism of the company\u2019s decision has been swift, and the official Blizzard subreddit closed following Blitzchung\u2019s suspension, Kotaku reported. It\u2019s not immediately clear if that closure was in response to the suspension.\n\nReddit users upset with Blizzard\u2019s decision have discussed boycotting its games. There\u2019s also online talk of protesting at BlizzCon, the company\u2019s official fan expo, which is set to kick off next month.", "description": "The gaming behemoth also pulled prize money from Hearthstone player Chung \"Blitzchung\" Ng Wai.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9ce051210000420733df92.jpeg?cache=kgdpbes8qa&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
