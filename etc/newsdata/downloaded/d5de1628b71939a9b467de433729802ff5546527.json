He is a bit of a funny guy but at the same time he is a serious guy.'\n\nNow Mane is leading the charge for Liverpool as they bid to claim their first Premier League crown for 30 years, and the player has hailed the effect his manager has had on him.\n\n'Usually when I am talking to him off the pitch it is about personal things. Things about lifestyle and life - and that is important to me. I think I have somebody I can confide in.'", "description": "The 27-year-old has become one of the most dangerous players in the Premier League under the guidance of Klopp since arriving from Southampton in 2016 in a \u00a334million deal.", "authors": ["Oli Gamp For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/09/19950480-0-image-a-10_1571560130642.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
