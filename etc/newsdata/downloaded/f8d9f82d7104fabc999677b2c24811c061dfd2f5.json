He did some great filming which will go out when the awards are broadcast in November.\n\n\u201cChris Packham gave us his support as well, and all that goes a long way in getting the message out there about how important our work is.\n\n\u201cAlready we\u2019ve managed to bring back the chequered skipper butterfly which disappeared from the UK in 1976.\n\n\u201cWe brought some females back from Belgium two years ago, and earlier this year we had our first crop of English-born ones in more than 40 years.\u201d\n\nOther creatures the team hopes to save include the narrow-headed ant and ladybird spider.\n\nRich added: \u201cThe narrow-headed ant is now completely restricted to Devon by the A38 dual carriageway. It\u2019s the only location we have them in England.\n\n\u201cThe hope is we can extract some from the colony and move them to new sites, growing the population that way. The techniques are quite experimental.\n\n\u201cThen in Dorset we have the poster girl of the project, the ladybird spider. It\u2019s a beautiful animal and we\u2019re working very hard to up the numbers there, too.\u201d\n\nThe 25 Birthday National Lottery Awards, hosted by Ore Oduba, will be on BBC One on November 19.", "description": "Back from the Brink fights to save the country\u2019s most at-risk species from extinction", "authors": ["Dave Masters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20723593.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Steve-Backshall-and-Back-From-the-Brink-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
