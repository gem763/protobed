(Brendan Smialowski / AFP)\n\nPresident Trump's trade war is crimping economic growth to the 2 percent pace he assailed as unacceptable in the Obama years.\n\nThat's the implication of new research from a group of Federal Reserve economists. They just released a first-of-its-kind study by the central bank to attempt to quantify the impact of the trade fight on GDP.\n\nThe researchers examined hundreds of corporate earnings-call transcripts and news stories to assess rising uncertainty spawned by the trade war and arrived at an estimated tab for it. The trade war, they estimate, will shave 1 percent off of growth through the early part of 2020.\n\nThat may not seem huge, but it's the difference between where growth has been tracking lately \u2014 bumping along at the respectable but unimpressive 2 percent level Trump blasted under President Barack Obama \u2014 and the 3 percent clip that Trump promised to deliver at a minimum. New data show further economic weakening, with the Atlanta Fed trimming its third-quarter GDP forecast to an annualized rate of just 1.5 percent.\n\nHere's how growth under the two presidents has stacked up so far:\n\nThe Fed researchers lay some blame on Trump\u2019s tariff escalation, writing that had he not ramped up import duties this spring, \u201cthe drag on GDP would have already started to ease in the second half of 2019.\u201d\n\nAnd they expressed doubt that the president would wind down the hostilities any time soon. \u201cWhile it is possible that negotiations will eventually lead to a more open and fair global competitive landscape, developments so far have resulted in an increase in uncertainty about the outlook for global trade,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cHigher uncertainty could lead firms to delay their investment and reduce their hiring, lower consumer confidence and spending, and ultimately curtail economic activity around the world.\u201d\n\nHere's what the Fed discovered about how trade war uncertainty has spiked in news stories and corporate earnings calls:\n\nFed policymakers have struggled to fit the trade war \u2014 a massive, continuously shape-shifting shock to the global supply chain \u2014 into their decision-making. Moved in part by trade war uncertainty, the central bank last month cut interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis. It looks almost certain to do so again in two weeks.\n\nThe Fed economists\u2019 attempt to quantify the trade war damage probably will factor in what\u2019s shaping up to be a spirited debate among central bank policymakers about what to do next. \u201cI think the research staff is looking to keep abreast of any topical issues that would change how they would adjust their macro forecast,\u201d Derek Tang, an economist at LH Meyer Inc., an economic-forecasting firm, tells me. \u201cThe difficulty with trade policy uncertainty is there\u2019s no set guide as to how to incorporate it into a forecast. There are very few test cases.\u201d\n\nTang said the report, which posted to the Fed\u2019s website Wednesday, has generated a lot of buzz among policymakers. \u201cThere are lots of people very focused on how the Fed sees itself equipped to deal with this issue,\u201d he said.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. (Reuters/Sarah Silbiger)\n\nTrump has mostly sought to blame the Fed for any economic sluggishness, criticizing the central bank for not cutting interest rates far or fast enough. But he acknowledged again this week that the trade war is imposing pain at home, arguing the Dow Jones industrial average would be 10,000 points higher if he had avoided the matter altogether. He said China\u2019s trading abuses forced his hand. \u201cSomebody had to do this,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday. Precisely what \u201cthis\u201d is \u2014 and what outcome would satisfy the president and convince him to wind down the confrontation with China \u2014 continues to befuddle forecasters, investors and business executives alike.\n\nU.S. and Chinese negotiators are set to meet next month to resume talks, news that sent stocks soaring Thursday. Yet two new tariff escalations are scheduled to bite in the weeks ahead: On Oct. 1, levies on $250 billion of Chinese imports will ratchet up from 25 percent to 30 percent; and on Dec. 15, all the rest of Chinese goods, a total worth $300 billion, will face a 15 percent tariff.\n\n\u201cOverall, the hit is hard,\u201d says Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist at S&P Global Ratings. \u201cWhile the trade dispute hurts and is causing market uncertainty, and businesses are starting to get gun-shy about investing, the domestic side of the equation is holding up rather well, which gives us a cushion.\u201d\n\nThe Fed will get another important clue about the strength of the domestic economy, and what damage the trade war may be wreaking, with the release of the August jobs report this morning. Employers cut 10,000 jobs in August because of trade pressures, according to a new report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. \u201cEmployers are beginning to feel the effects of the trade war and imposed tariffs by the U.S. and China,\u201d Andrew Challenger, vice president of the company, said in a Thursday statement, per Bloomberg.\n\nYou are reading The Finance 202, our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.

(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\n\u2014 Trump administration unveils plan to revamp housing market: \u201cThe Trump administration released a sweeping plan Thursday that could remake the U.S. housing market, starting with ending more than a decade of government control of two massive companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that back half of the nation\u2019s mortgages,\u201d my colleague Renae Merle reports.\n\n\u201cThe long-awaited plan from the Treasury Department features nearly 50 proposals, including many technical changes to financial regulations, and is aimed at shrinking the government\u2019s role in the housing market. The cornerstone of the plan would resolve the fates of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which 11 years ago this week were put into government conservatorship during the global financial crisis.\u201d\n\nThe future of Fannie and Freddie: \u201cFannie Mae and Freddie Mac represent the last major unresolved business from the financial crisis, and [Treasury Secretary Steven] Mnuchin has called them a top priority for more than two years. Under the plan, they would be turned back into private companies but would be required to pay taxpayers a fee for government protection. It would also open the market up to competitors for the first time.\u201d\n\n\u201cFannie Mae and Freddie Mac represent the last major unresolved business from the financial crisis, and [Treasury Secretary Steven] Mnuchin has called them a top priority for more than two years.

I\u2019m urging the president: Make it easier for working people to buy or rent their homes, not harder,\u201d said Sen. Sherrod Brown (Ohio), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nTRADE-FLY AROUND:\n\n\u2014 Services sector suggests economy is doing fine: \u201cU.S. services sector activity accelerated in August and private employers boosted hiring, suggesting the economy continued to grow at a moderate pace despite trade tensions which have stoked financial market fears of a recession,\u201d Reuters\u2019s Lucia Mutikani reports.\n\n\u201cThe upbeat reports on Thursday took some of the sting from data this week that showed the manufacturing sector contracted for the first time in August as the year-old trade war between the United States and China intensified. \u2018It\u2019s a tale of two cities in this economy faced with trade war uncertainty, and right now the bigger services economy is weathering the storm,\u2019 said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Japan deal far from done. Bloomberg's Jenny Leonard: \"The U.S. and Japan are still thrashing out details of a trade deal that [Trump] wants to sign this month, including the crucial issue of whether he\u2019ll refrain from imposing higher tariffs on imported cars, according to people familiar with the matter. Trump, at the Group of Seven meeting in France last month, celebrated what he called a 'major deal' that he and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would sign on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, starting later this month in New York.\n\n\"But people familiar with the talks said the leaders only agreed on the broad strokes of a trade deal. Negotiators are now finalizing many of the core elements, including how much Japan is willing to open its agriculture market to U.S. imports, cuts to industrial tariffs, and the treatment of digital trade that could impact U.S. technology giants like Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google.\"\n\nMARKET MOVERS\n\nTrader Michael Milano works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

CNN's Anneken Tappe: \"The Dow and the broader stock market rallied sharply on Thursday, logging its best day in three weeks, after US and Chinese officials said they will resume trade talks. The escalating tensions between the world's two largest economies has weighed on markets throughout the summer. But the new talks, on the agenda for early October, are spurring optimism.\n\n\"Stocks soared in response, with the Dow rising 379 points, or 1.4%, closing at its best level since July 31. It was its best one-day percentage gain since August 13. The S&P 500 finished 1.3% higher, logging its best day since August 16, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.8%. It was the index's best session since August 13.\"\n\n\u2014 August jobs numbers could be misleading. Bloomberg's Jeff Kearns and Reade Pickert: \"U.S. jobs data due Friday may be inflated by Census Bureau hiring for the 2020 count, and economists say the underlying numbers may show that job gains are slowing. Nonfarm payrolls increased by about 160,000 in August, according to Bloomberg\u2019s survey, a level that would be just under the prior month, but still more than enough to keep pace with growth in the working-age population.\n\n\"The unemployment rate is projected to hold at 3.7%, just above a 49-year low, though annual wage gains are seen cooling to 3%, the weakest in almost a year. But some economists said their estimates reflected an expected temporary boost from recent Census hiring.\"\n\nBiggest Bond Rout in Years Whiplashes Bulls Who Were Right After August\u2019s historic drop, it was starting to seem like Treasury yields could only fall.

At least another $50 billion is projected for the rest of the month, and the activity is spilling over to junk bonds and leveraged loans as well.

AP's Josh Boak: \"Despite a decade-plus of economic growth, Americans have slowed the pace at which they\u2019re forming new companies, a trend that risks further widening the gap between the most affluent and everyone else.
