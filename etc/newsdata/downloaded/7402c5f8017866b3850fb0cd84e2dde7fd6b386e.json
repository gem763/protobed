But, what really is his claim based on?\n\nRetweeting a tweet from Raoul Pal, Founder/CEO \u2013 Global Macro Investor and Real Vision Group, Peter shared a BTC/USD chart which looks something as below. Let\u2019s see what \u2018possible\u2019 factors \u2018inspired\u2019 him to do the same.\n\nBest Time To Get On The \u2018Bitcoin Rocket Ship\u2019 Is Now\n\nPal made specific comments regarding wedge pattern formation on the bitcoin price chart, which according to him is a robust uptrend indicator in itself. He clearly doubled down on the idea of BTC, as a potential way out of an impending recession.\n\nRaoul based his thoughts on numerous factors viz., the complete, deflationary breakdown of the Commodity Index, the European Union (EU) & Japanese banking system.\n\nHe even went ahead with charting a potential yield collapse to -4% for the two-year U.S. Treasury.\n\nWhat happens if the bond bears are wrong and the shock is not a sharp rise in yields, but instead a fall in yields so far yet unimagined. How about -4% in US 2 years? pic.twitter.com/F8QGbJ5pZC \u2014 Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) August 31, 2019\n\nBTC Price Stock-to-Flow Relation Is Strong\n\nBashing opinions regarding the correlation of Litecoin\u2019s lackluster post-halving price performance with bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving, celebrated quantitative analyst PlanB mentioned that the above logic is flawed.\n\nUnlike Litecoin, Bitcoin has a significant stock-to-flow relation and the cryptocurrency\u2019s May 2020 halving is still pretty much relevant in this regard. This, in turn, will have a positive effect on the price.\n\nSome people think that because litecoin didn't jump on ltc halving, btc halving will also be irrelevant for #bitcoin. That logic is flawed. LTC price doesn't have a significant relationship with stock to flow, so halvings are indeed irrelevant. BTC price-s2f relation is strong \ud83d\ude80 https://t.co/5Wx7vHLvUd \u2014 PlanB (@100trillionUSD) August 31, 2019\n\nHowever, PlanB has made it clear that the bitcoin stock-to-flow model does not predict BTC\u2019s price at any moment in time, and does not predict bitcoin price ATH & ATL levels or timing.\n\nWhat it does though is predicting what level BTC price will oscillate around. Prominent Bitcoin investor Alistair Milne also doesn\u2019t expect a bear market to happen, when we are so close to the next halving.\n\n$28,000 Bitcoin Price In Play: Max Keiser\n\nCiting game theory and commenting on the latest explosive Bitcoin mining hash rate performance, permabull Max Keiser set a $28,000 bitcoin price target, in one of his recent tweets.\n\n#Bitcoin hash approaches 90 Quintillion. Per protocol\u2019s hard-coded Game Theory, hash precedes price. $28,000 in play. \u2014 Max Keiser, tweet poet. (@maxkeiser) September 1, 2019\n\nKeiser reasoned that per the \u201cprotocol\u2019s hard-coded Game Theory, hash precedes bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHashrate refers to the amount of computing power servicing the Bitcoin network. The more hashes per second involved, the more power miners are devoting to processing and validating transactions.\n\nA higher network hash rate also means better security and often better decentralization of mining power across more users.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is clocking an all-time high mining hashrate of 84,033,177 TH/s, data from monitoring resource and wallet provider Blockchain.com confirmed.\n\nThat number is a record in BTC\u2019s ten-year history.\n\nDo all these points explain Mr. Brandt\u2019s \u2018parabolic\u2019 argument? We guess it does, but then these are just assumptions and when it comes to actual market movements, things are very different.\n\nDo you think Bitcoin price will go parabolic in the near future?
