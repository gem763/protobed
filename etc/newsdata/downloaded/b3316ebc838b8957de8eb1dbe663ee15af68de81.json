We\u2019re sorry for any inconvenience.\u201d Instagram similarly said its issues were more or less resolved, too.\n\nEarlier today, some people and businesses experienced trouble uploading or sending images, videos and other files on our apps. The issue has since been resolved and we should be back at 100% for everyone. We're sorry for any inconvenience. \u2014 Facebook Business (@FBBusiness) July 3, 2019\n\nWe\u2019re back!

The errors aren\u2019t affecting all images; many pictures on Facebook and Instagram still load, but others are appearing blank. DownDetector has also received reports of people being unable to load messages in Facebook Messenger.\n\nThe outage persisted through mid-day, with Facebook releasing a second statement, where it apologized \u201cfor any inconvenience.\u201d Facebook\u2019s platform status website still lists a \u201cpartial outage,\u201d with a note saying that the company is \u201cworking on a fix that will go out shortly.\u201d\n\nApps and websites are always going to experience occasional disruptions due to the complexity of services they\u2019re offering. But even when they\u2019re brief, they can become a real problem due to the huge number of users many of these services have. A Facebook outage affects a suite of popular apps, and those apps collectively have billions of users who rely on them. That\u2019s a big deal when those services have become critical for business and communications, and every hour they\u2019re offline or acting strange can mean real inconveniences or lost money.\n\nWe\u2019re aware that some people are having trouble uploading or sending images, videos and other files on our apps. We're sorry for the trouble and are working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible. #facebookdown \u2014 Facebook (@facebook) July 3, 2019\n\nUpdate July 3rd, 3:55PM ET: Updated with an additional statement from Facebook describing the cause of the outage.\n\nUpdate July 3rd, 8:05PM ET: Updated with additional statements from Facebook and Instagram indicating the outage is over.", "description": "Facebook has had problems loading images, videos, and other data across its apps today, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.
