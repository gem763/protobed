It matters. If you vote Leave, we will leave.' We have to do that, otherwise our whole democratic system, I think, is under real attack.\"\n\nShe spoke to CNBC after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson failed in his bid to call a snap general election on Wednesday, after lawmakers took control of Parliament this week and voted through a bill that aims to stop a no-deal Brexit. Hoey was one of a few Labour MPs who voted in favor of snap elections.\n\nIn a no-deal Brexit scenario, the U.K. would leave the EU without a deal in place. It would be an abrupt departure, without any transition period for businesses based in Britain to adjust to life outside the bloc.\n\nNew legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit was passed by a vote of 327-299 on Wednesday and could now essentially force Johnson to ask the EU for another delay for the U.K. departure, which has a current deadline of Oct. 31. The EU would have to agree to a delay and the bill would also have to be approved by the largely pro-EU House of Lords \u2014 the upper house of parliament \u2014 later this week.\n\nHoey said that Johnson is \"determined to honor the will of the British people.\"\n\nAsked if she thought the British people could've changed their minds about Brexit since the initial vote, she said people have become more aware of just how \"anti-democratic the European Union is. And, how restrictive it has made some of the ways that a country can trade independently.\"\n\nIn fact, she said, if there were another referendum, even more people would likely vote to leave.", "description": "Kate Hoey, a pro-Brexit member of parliament from the Labour Party, said Britain's democratic system would be under attack if the U.K. failed to leave the EU.", "authors": ["Saheli Roy Choudhury"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106112603-1567658769631gettyimages-1133593296.jpeg?v=1567658832", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
