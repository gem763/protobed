I was still recovering from my seventh-grader announcing she had been invited to the mall for the first time. And now he wanted my exhausted brain to contemplate the vault of online sex my 11-year-old \u2014 who still plays with Calico Critters, mind you \u2014 will one day be exposed to? Hard pass.\n\nI started thinking about whether I could invent a time machine and go back to parenting a toddler or, heck, a tween in the 1980s. It\u2019s hard enough to talk to your kids about plain old sex, let alone the panoply of pornography available to them through any electronic device.\n\nBut my husband interrupted my time travel reverie to make a point that applies to so much of parenting: \u201cJust because you\u2019re scared of it, doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t talk about it.\u201d He was right, of course, so I dove in and ran with it.\n\nI called some of the top experts on kids, sex and the digital age. What I learned helped me have a conversation that was way less scary than I imagined, so I put together this hand-holding guide for any parents who, like me, are filled with equal measures of good intentions and fear.\n\nStick with me. I\u2019m going to front-load the scary stuff to end on a more reassuring note. And know that your tween or teen is going to give you 10 minutes, tops. That takes a little pressure off and means there\u2019s no way you will hit all these points. Pick a few that resonate with your values. Experts emphasized that this shouldn\u2019t be a one-off chat anyway, but part of an ongoing conversation about healthy sexuality. You can do it. Here\u2019s how.\n\nAccept that your child is likely to see sex on the Internet. There are many routes that exposure can take, from an innocent Google search to a kid on the bus who thinks it\u2019s hilarious to show your child a clip on a phone. \u201cIt used to be that you had to borrow your brother\u2019s Playboy, and now all you have to do is Google \u2018boobs,\u2019\u201d says Lisa Damour, a psychologist and author of \u201cUnder Pressure: Confronting the Epidemic of Stress and Anxiety in Girls.\u201d Several years ago, she talked with the family of a 9-year-old boy who went looking for \u201cDick\u2019s Sporting Goods\u201d online and, well, you can imagine the rest.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury to be awkward,\u201d says Peggy Orenstein, author of \u201cGirls and Sex\u201d and the forthcoming \u201cBoys and Sex.\u201d \u201cIf we don\u2019t get in there, we are letting the media and porn educate our kids.\u201d\n\n[In the battle against unsavory online content, I'm enlisting my tweens on my team]\n\nKnow that this is not your brother\u2019s Playboy. The content available is much more hardcore than it was when we were growing up. \u201cThere are videos of people engaged in what may or may not be consensual acts that most people don\u2019t prefer \u2014 or would require heavy negotiation between partners \u2014 and look very violent,\u201d says Devorah Heitner, author of \u201cScreenwise: Helping Kids Thrive (and Survive) in Their Digital World.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t want your 10-year-old son or 5-year-old daughter to assume they are everyday acts.\u201d But they might if you don\u2019t tell them otherwise.\n\nExplain that porn and sex are not the same. Kids don\u2019t have years of mature sexual experience to put porn into perspective, which means they may equate what they see with this \u201csex\u201d thing they\u2019ve heard about. Let your child know that online porn may be scary and could freak them out. That \u201cit depicts people who are paid to have sex on camera and may not represent a tender, romantic sex life that is healthy and happy and mutual,\u201d says Damour. That alone can bring them tremendous relief if (or when) they come across it.\n\nPosition yourself as an ally. With any potential pitfall of adolescence \u2014 vaping, drinking, drugs or porn \u2014 you can\u2019t help your kids safely over it if you don\u2019t know they are facing it. So the No. 1 goal in any conversation about tough subjects is to get across that you are the person to talk to.\n\nLet your child know that if they see something upsetting, you want to know. \u201cThe rule is: If you see something like that, turn off the device and let me know,\u201d says Amy Lang, a sex educator in Seattle. \u201cYou won\u2019t be in trouble.\u201d\n\nPositioning yourself less as an arbiter of rules and more as an ally to help your child understand and navigate these tricky topics will increase the likelihood that they will talk to you. Damour suggests saying, \u201cI want you to know that we can talk about anything you see however it is you come across it.\u201d\n\nTalk about gender dynamics. Orenstein has interviewed hundreds of tweens and teens, and what concerns her most about their exposure to pornography is \u201cnot the explicitness, but the message, which shows female pleasure in service to men and eroticizes male aggression and female submission.\u201d\n\nDamour agrees. \u201cPornography coalesces around themes of violence against women,\u201d she says. Explaining this dynamic can help reinforce the values you do want them to learn about treating people (in intimacy or otherwise) with respect, seeking enthusiastic consent and working toward a healthy sex life (someday).\n\nProtect your kids at home. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be said for putting in as many speed bumps as possible,\u201d says Damour. Make use of the parental controls and filtering options offered by your Internet service provider, devices and browser. Common Sense Media offers this helpful guide to help you get started.\n\nSome parents enforce a \u201cno device in the bedroom or on the second-floor\u201d rule. Another option is monitoring your kids\u2019 online behavior. Monitoring software enables you to block specific sites and search results (by choosing key words), and keeps a record of what your child is doing.\n\nIf you choose monitoring software, Lang and Damour recommend that you let your child know. \u201cTell them, \u2018There\u2019s yucky stuff on the Internet, so we will be getting an email letting us know where you\u2019ve been, so we know you\u2019re safe,'\u201d Lang says.\n\n\u201cIf you find out they\u2019ve done something they weren\u2019t supposed to, you can talk to them about it,\u201d Damour adds. That conversation will be much more awkward \u2014 and potentially harmful to your relationship \u2014 if your kid discovers you\u2019ve been tracking their activity in secret. Plus, you miss out on one of the benefits of monitoring, says Damour: \u201cKnowing that you are watching is its own speed bump.\u201d\n\nProtect your kids outside your home. Of course, those safeguards won\u2019t stop another child from sharing inappropriate content with yours. Help your child prepare responses in case it happens, including letting them know they can throw you under the bus with a comeback like, \u201cMy mom will kill me if she knows I\u2019ve looked at that.\u201d Or \u201cParents are sneaky. Yours could have monitoring software.\u201d Or the more straightforward, \u201cI don\u2019t want to see that.\u201d Brainstorming some options with your kid will give them a chance to practice saying \u201cno.\u201d It also makes you two a team (rather than adversaries) focused on the shared goal of staying safe.\n\nShare your values about sex. \u201cThe easiest way to help your kids survive their porn exposure is by making sure that they already know what sex is and your values about sexuality,\u201d Lang says. This accomplishes two things. It makes it less likely that your child will head to the Internet to learn about sex. And you will be helping your child think through what they do want from an intimate relationship. There are great resources to help you, including online lists from Orenstein and Lang. But only you (or your co-parent) can offer personalized support to your child and share your family\u2019s values.\n\nChoose your moment. Take a deep breath, pick a low-key, calm moment when you are not face-to-face \u2014 when you are doing dishes, folding laundry, or on a walk, say \u2014 and go for it.\n\nI\u2019ll confess that I had my conversation face-to-face, and it was fine. We\u2019re not going for perfect. We\u2019re going for doing it. I got 80 percent of my points across. It was way less uncomfortable and scary than I expected. And it was a short conversation. There will be more to come, I know. But with one under my belt, I am way less worried about future chats.\n\nKate Rope is a mother and the author of \u201cStrong as a Mother: How to Stay Happy, Healthy and (Most Importantly) Sane From Pregnancy to Parenthood.\u201d Find her on Twitter @katerope.\n\nFollow On Parenting on Facebook for more essays, news and updates.
