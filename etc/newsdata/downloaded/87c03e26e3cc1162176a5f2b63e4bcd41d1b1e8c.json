It\u2019s how do you get your fiat currencies in and out? [...] very difficult, since no information is collected on a decentralized exchange, no name, no address, no social security number, no email, nothing.\u201d\n\nRather than find a mechanism for fiat conversions, McAfee outlined his vision for a reality in which national fiat currencies become increasingly irrelevant and a plurality of cryptocurrencies are sufficient to meet individuals\u2019 needs:\n\n\u201cImagine a world six months from now, a year from now, two years from now, where fiat currency is diminishing in importance, you can only buy houses and cars and shoes with crypto, with Bitcoin and Monero and Ethereum and others [...] soon we\u2019ll have the ability to acquire everything that we need with crypto.\u201d\n\nMcAfee then proceeded to qualify his vision by proposing that \u2014 presumably in the interim \u2014 stablecoins such as DAI can help reduce the need for DEX users to be concerned about fiat withdrawals.\n\nThe DAI, he noted, is programmed via smart contracts to never lose dollar parity by more than one percentage point \u2014 no matter the situation on the cryptocurrency markets:\n\n\u201cImagine getting your currency out [of a DEX] in DAI, it\u2019s always going to be worth a dollar.\u201d\n\nMcAfee DEX\n\nAs reported, McAfee launched the McAfee DEX earlier this month; a decentralized, distributed trading platform that entails no Know Your Customer checks and doesn\u2019t block any jurisdictions.\n\nAny ETH-based token (ERC-20 standard) \u2014 such as DAI \u2014 can be added without a fee to the beta version, with more unspecified tokens to be supported in the future.\n\nAt the time of its launch, McAfee argued in favor of DEXs by underscoring that the crypto community faces the question of whether its aspirations are limited to merely expanding the possibilities for pure speculation \u2014 \u201call about money\u201d \u2014 or are about an ideal, namely freedom.\n\nAs of January 2019, a survey of over 400 international crypto exchanges had indicated that decentralized platforms accounted for just 19% of the global exchange ecosystem, and their trading volumes amounted to less than 1% of those on centralized exchanges.", "description": "American entrepreneur and staunch crypto advocate, John McAfee, has argued for the importance of stablecoins for decentralized exchange adoption", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNTI1YzlkYmNjMzA5MGQzOTFjYjk1YWIxM2IxMTUzMGEuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
