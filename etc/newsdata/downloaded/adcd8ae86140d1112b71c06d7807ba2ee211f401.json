Chief Executive Bill Johnson walked into a room full of California lawmakers and told them he was the man who would fix the state\u2019s largest utility.\n\nJohnson was 15 days on the job, and PG&E had just been found to have caused California\u2019s Camp Fire, which killed 86 people, leveled an entire town and landed the company in the biggest utility bankruptcy in U.S. history. \u201cLet\u2019s not do it again,\u201d he said.\n\nThis week, PG&E proved its problems are far from fixed. The company\u2019s equipment is being probed as the potential cause of at least three fires that have erupted in the past week. One still rages across wine country. To keep its power lines from igniting more, the company has plunged millions of people into darkness four times this month. And the 65-year-old CEO, a 27-year veteran of utilities, has found himself defending decisions that, he says, are the result of extreme weather \u201cbeyond anybody\u2019s control.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any executive in the utilities industry has faced a situation like this,\u201d said Travis Miller, a utilities analyst for Morningstar. \u201cHe faces almost a day-to-day risk of losing his job.\u201d\n\nClimate change has brought about increasingly severe weather in California, dragging it through cycles from heavy rains to unprecedented drought. That has turned the state into a tinderbox every summer and fall, primed to be lit by fallen wires. PG&E has no choice, it says, but to carry out mass blackouts. It\u2019s a last-ditch attempt at keeping high winds from knocking over live power lines and setting dry brush ablaze.\n\nThis past weekend, during PG&E\u2019s largest outage yet, Johnson stayed behind the scenes. He skipped PG&E\u2019s daily media briefings, where company executives faced increasing scrutiny. On Tuesday, he emerged once again at the company\u2019s headquarters to field questions on the latest round of blackouts -- and to implore the public not to take its anger out on employees.\n\nFor more on the future of California\u2019s blackouts, listen to this podcast.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I told you it doesn\u2019t affect me,\u201d Johnson said of the growing ire he\u2019s also facing. \u201cEverybody who says it doesn\u2019t affect you isn\u2019t telling the truth -- because we\u2019re all human. But you cannot let that affect your decision making. You cannot make decisions based on public sentiment or that angry letter you got.\u201d\n\nLuxury Helicopter\n\nIn an interview late Tuesday, Johnson said he\u2019ll remain in the job for as long as he\u2019s helpful. \u201cI really am here on a mission,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that sounds old-fashioned, maybe, but that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. And the mission is to help rectify this situation.\u201d\n\nJohnson didn\u2019t have to take the job with PG&E. He could have easily retired, he told lawmakers in May.\n\nBefore accepting the gig, he enjoyed a long run as chief of the sleepy, federally owned utility Tennessee Valley Authority, where he made $6.5 million a year -- more than any other federal employee. In a style that\u2019s atypical for even some of his corporate peers, he traveled with his own security detail and flew around in an $11 million Cessna jet, according to a critical 2018 government audit.\n\nHis job wasn\u2019t without controversy: In February, he defied President Donald Trump with TVA\u2019s decision to retire a coal-fired power plant in Kentucky.\n\nRead More: Why California Fire Threats Cut Lights for Millions: QuickTake\n\n\u2018Fix-It Guy\u2019\n\nBefore PG&E, however, Johnson was best known as the victim of a strange moment of boardroom drama. In 2012, he was fired as CEO of Duke Energy Corp. less than an hour after the energy giant finalized its takeover of his prior company, Progress Energy. Delays at a troubled nuclear reactor contributed to his demise. At a hearing, a teary eyed Johnson said he didn\u2019t even get a chance to say goodbye to his staff.\n\nJohnson didn\u2019t seek out the PG&E job -- it \u201ccalled me,\u201d he said back in May. He described himself as a \u201cfix-it guy,\u201d someone who cared enough about the industry to take the job nobody else wanted.\n\n\u201cI have the luxury at this point in my life and career of really doing what you want to do, and this is something I want to do,\u201d Johnson said Tuesday.\n\nThe pay probably didn\u2019t hurt. Johnson scored a $2.5 million salary, more than double that of his predecessor, Geisha Williams, who was ousted before the company filed for bankruptcy. He also got $3.5 million in annual stock awards, a $3 million one-time transition bonus and stock options, according to an April company filing. Altogether, his target compensation totals $6 million.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Five months ago, PG&E Corp.
