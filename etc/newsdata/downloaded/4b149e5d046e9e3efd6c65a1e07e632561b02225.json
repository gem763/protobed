That's a jump up from just 9 percent a decade ago. From large-scale wind farms to single panels installed on rooftops, renewable energy has gone from novel to commonplace.\"\n\nThat being said, the electrical grid that brings power to homes and businesses will need to continue being updated in order to accommodate the ever-growing renewable energy industry.\n\nNicki Zvik, Founder of Green Solar Technologies, states, \"If we're going to get to a place where our country is powered by 100% renewable energy, we're going to need a lot of grid space to do so. We as a country can't quite support 100% clean energy yet, but we're getting there, and as alternative methods of energy continue to rise in popularity, the methods by which power is brought to homes and businesses will continue to be modernized.\"\n\nThe GreenBiz article continues, \"Electricity producers and the utility companies that distribute that electricity to households and businesses throughout the country are working to make it easier for renewable sources to provide that power, according to John Jimison, executive director of Americans for a Clean Energy Grid, a non-profit advocacy group focusing on modernizing the grid. 'The basis of the transition is the need to get off carbon-based energy and stop emitting greenhouse gases,' Jimison says. 'That's a priority for everybody who understands the science.'\"\n\n\"Because the need to switch from carbon-based energy to renewable sources is so widely accepted and celebrated, it shouldn't be long before the rest of the country gets on board with states like California and Hawaii in committing to going 100% solar within the next few decades,\" shares Zvik, \"As long as every state has the ability to make the switch, and as long as Americans continue to see the importance of going carbon-free, there should be nothing holding us back from becoming a solar-powered country in the not-so-distant future.\"\n\nNicki Zvik is the founder of Green Solar Technologies and Spectrum Properties LLC.", "description": "LOS ANGELES, Oct. 17, 2019 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- As renewable energy becomes more and more prominent, it is essential to ensure the grid is prepared to take it on.
