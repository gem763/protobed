The thoughtful ring will help remind the couple of the start of their relationship\n\nThe pair celebrate the engagement with a glass of fizz. Half of environmentally conscious generation Y claiming they would like their engagement rings to be recycled\n\nA further 73 per cent of those surveyed said they relied on their smartphone to meet potential suitors - and 30 per cent of those said they were looking for someone to marry rather than a casual relationship.\n\nThe study found that over a quarter of millennials spoke to their beloved on the phone more than they did in person, with the average millennial texting and calling their partner for three hours of the day.\n\nWith half of environmentally conscious generation Y claiming they would like their engagement rings to be recycled this may offer a solution when re-purposing the hard to recycle components from our technology filled lives.", "description": "James Lawrence, 24, and Hayley Orchard, 26, from\u00a0Melksham, Wiltshire, have transformed their old iPhones into something much more precious in a homage to technology that brought them together.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/16/20286580-0-image-a-2_1572278742837.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
