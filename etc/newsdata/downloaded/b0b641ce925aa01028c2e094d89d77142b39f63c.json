I also found them very credible,\u201d said Democrat Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nAt least one Republican member of the Senate Intelligence Committee expressed dismay about the complaint\u2019s contents. Senator Ben Sasse, who has been critical of fellow Republican Trump, said there were \u201creal troubling things here.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepublicans ought not just circle the wagons\u201d to protect Trump, he said after leaving a secure room where senators read the complaint.\n\nThe Democratic-led House of Representatives on Tuesday launched a formal impeachment inquiry of Trump over the Ukraine matter.\n\nAfter initially resisting demands by Democrats in Congress to see the whistleblower complaint, the Trump administration relented and allowed members of the House of Representatives and Senate Intelligence committees to view it on Wednesday.\n\nThe acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, was due to testify about the issue before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday.\n\nTrump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July phone call to launch a probe of Biden and his son, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company. The call occurred after Trump had ordered a freeze of nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine. A summary of the call was released by the Trump administration on Wednesday.\n\nThere has been no evidence that Biden, who served as U.S. vice president from 2009 to 2017, used his position to help his son in the Ukraine matter.\n\nA Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee, Mike Conaway, said after reading the complaint he did not think it would compromise Trump if it was declassified.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything that bothers me,\u201d Conaway said.\n\nU.S. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) speaks during a news conference about impeachment proceedings at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., September 25, 2019.
