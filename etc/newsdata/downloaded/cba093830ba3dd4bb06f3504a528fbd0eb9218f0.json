Worryingly, staff in each shop claimed they did not stock anything containing hydroquinone.\n\nCorrie viewers saw Asha, played by Tanisha Gorey, 17, order illegal bleaching creams after a trip to India with her dad Dev.\n\nWe discovered numerous overseas sellers willing to ship products containing hydroquinone to the UK despite it being illegal here due to its strength.\n\nDr Bav Shergill of the British Association of Dermatologists, who regularly sees patients who have had a nasty reaction to the creams, told us: \u201cHigh doses of hydroquinone can make you very unwell.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Investigators discover that toxic lotions that can increase risk of cancer are on sale in the UK for as little as \u00a37.99, following controversial Corrie storyline", "authors": ["Amy Sharpe", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20466656.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Asha-Alahan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
