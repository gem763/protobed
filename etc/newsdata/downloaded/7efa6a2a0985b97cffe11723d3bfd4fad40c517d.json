We\u2019re suing to expose improper attempts to politicize NOAA because the public needs to be able to count on science agencies to do their jobs without political interference,\u201d Democracy Forward Executive Director Anne Harkavy said in a statement, The Hill reported.\n\nNOAA has been under fire recently after a memo was released in early September that incorrectly supported President Trump\u2019s claims that Hurricane Dorian would pose a threat to Alabama.\n\nResearch Assistant Administrator Craig McLean said NOAA would be investigating the origins of the \u201cpolitical\u201d memo, calling it\u2019s release \u201cvery concerning.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump defended his warnings that Hurricane Dorian would threaten parts of Alabama, despite forecasts that later showed the state was in virtually no danger of being hit.\n\nDuring an Oval Office press gaggle, Mr. Trump even displayed a hurricane forecast map with an extra bubble drawn in black ink to include parts of Alabama, reportedly to prove his point.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
