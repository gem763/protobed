Quarterback Ian Book completed just 8 of 25 passes for 73 yards and a touchdown. The Irish were held to 180 total yards.\n\nThe Irish were limited to 52 total yards and three first downs in the first half as the Wolverines jumped to a 17-0 lead.\n\nThe Wolverines got on the board with a 21-yard Jake Moody field goal with 5:25 left in the first quarter. Charbonnet had a 35-yard run to bring Michigan inside the Irish's 5 but the Wolverines couldn't punch it in.\n\nThe next possession was a different story. Relying solely on the ground game, Michigan put together an eight-play, 59-yard drive finished off by Charbonnet's 7-yard scamper up the middle.\n\nFollowing a three-and out for Notre Dame, Michigan scored again early in the second quarter. Patterson's 22-yard run set up Charbonnet's 1-yard scoring run.\n\nNotre Dame broke through with 5:27 left in the third quarter on Book's 7-yard scoring pass to tight end Cole Kmet. Book rolled out to his right and threw across the field to a wide open Kmet. The drive was kept alive by a questionable pass interference call that wiped away a Michigan interception.\n\nHaskins burst through a hole for a 49-yard run on Michigan's next drive, taking the ball to the Notre Dame 26-yard line. The Irish were then whistled for pass interference twice before Patterson tossed an 8-yard scoring pass to Donovan Peoples-Jones to make it 24-7, which is where the score stood at the end of three quarters.\n\nPatterson's 16-yard scoring strike to Nico Collins with 11:29 remaining gave the Wolverines a 31-7 lead. Tru Wilson scored on a 27-yard run less than three minutes later to make it 38-7, and Dylan McCaffrey's 26-yard pass to Mike Sainristil completed Michigan's scoring. The Irish's Phil Jurkovec found Javon McKinley from 14 yards out to make it 45-14 with 3:45 to play and round out the scoring.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Zach Charbonnet ran for two touchdowns and Hassan Haskins rushed for 149 yards  on 20 carries as No. 19 Michigan dealt a crushing blow to No. 8 Notre Dame's ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
