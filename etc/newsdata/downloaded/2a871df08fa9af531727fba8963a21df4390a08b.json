Here she lists her six helpful study tips for mastering these subjects.\n\nVisit the Parent24 school exams hub for free practice papers, study guides, exam advice and more.\n\nUse a calendar\n\nTo help you plan what needs to be covered and by when, break up the task into bite-sized, manageable pieces.\n\nThis will ensure that you cover everything and do not become overwhelmed by the enormity of it.\n\nMake sure that you have a designated study area\n\nHave a comfortable chair, a desk, good lighting and the stationery that you will need.\n\nStay away from the parrot-fashion approach\n\nYou cannot study Maths or Science by reading and trying to memorise the work. These subjects require pencil to paper!\n\nYou will need to practice, practice and practice some more! Do not just do one example of a skill and feel that it is enough. Keep going until you know that you will not forget how to do it\n\nNote: Try using a pencil instead of a pen. It is a non-threatening tool as it can be rubbed out. It also makes your work look neater.\n\nStart with easy-mark skills and questions first\n\nMake sure that you know these well. This will give you the confidence to keep going.\n\nWork through past exam papers\n\nFamiliarise yourself with the layout of the paper as well as the types of questions that are likely to be asked. Again, do not feel like you are ready after completing just one paper.\n\nKeep at it \u2013 you will feel your confidence increase as you practice.\n\nAsk for help if you need it\n\nIdentify questions that you are not 'getting' and ask for clarification from someone who can help \u2013 your teacher, a friend, your parents or a tutor.\n\nFind old math and science exam papers here\n\nBut what about handling exam stress and anxiety?\n\n\"The trouble with exams is that the task of preparing effectively seems an almost insurmountable one \u2013 most especially for learners who may have made some negative choices for themselves throughout the year,\" Cindy explains.\n\n\n\nTo avoid seeing exams as an \"insurmountable\" undertaking, Cindy says a shift in mentality is necessary, sharing her top 4 tips for keeping an even keel while getting ready for finals.\n\nChange your mindset\n\nHow badly do you WANT to achieve success? What are you WILLING to do to get where you want to go? If you are eager to put in what it will take to achieve your goals, you will reap the rewards.\n\nBelieve that you are capable\n\nNo matter what your learning experiences have been to date, you CAN turn it around. You are in control of your learning. You are responsible for your success. Believe that you can!\n\nStart now\n\nRemember, you are doing this for yourself, and there is no better time to get going than right now.\n\nCommit to healthy boundaries with others\n\nIt is up to you to ensure that your cell phone is switched off during study time and that your friends and family respect your boundaries.\n\nThis is your life to live - do not allow others to distract your purpose! You can and must do this by being respectfully assertive.\n\n\n\n\"Remember that you are allowed to make mistakes, but you are not allowed to give up!
