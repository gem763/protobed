He was arrested for selling a Tokyo man in his 40s a modded PS3 for 15,555 yen ($216).\n\nNot only does this violate Japanese trademark law, but it also violates the country\u2019s Unfair Competition Prevention Law, which protects the rights of companies to sell their products.\n\nThe modded PS3 was sold last year through an online auction site. Abe, a part-time worker, was arrested yesterday. In an affidavit, he said he did this for income.\n\nAuthorities found forty PlayStation 3s in his apartment and are currently investigating whether or not they have been modded.", "description": "Forty-four-year-old Tadaaki Abe has been arrested in Kagawa, Japan for modding PlayStation 3s and then selling them....", "authors": ["Luke Plunkett", "Alex Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/meclrzpcbk9lpjsxcbnk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
