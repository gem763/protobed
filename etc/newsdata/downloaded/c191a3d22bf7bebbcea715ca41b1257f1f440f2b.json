The report did not mention the exact number by which Trump is looking to cut the agency's staff.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.\n\nThe development comes as Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives are examining whether there are grounds to impeach Republican Trump based on a whistleblower's account that said he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 25 phone call to help investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden.\n\nLawmakers are investigating concerns that Trump's actions have jeopardized national security and the integrity of U.S. elections.
