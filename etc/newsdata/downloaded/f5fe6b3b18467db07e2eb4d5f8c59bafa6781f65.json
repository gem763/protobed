Zachary Terwilliger, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement announcing the suit. \u201cThis lawsuit will ensure that Edward Snowden receives no monetary benefits from breaching the trust placed in him.\u201d\n\nSnowden, a former CIA employee and National Security Agency contractor who leaked a trove of documents detailing top-secret U.S. surveillance programs, is abroad in Russia. He is charged in the United States with espionage and recently told CBS News he would like to return \u2014 but only if he would be allowed to defend himself at trial by asserting his actions were in the public interest. That type of defense is not allowed under U.S. law.\n\n[The lawsuit: United States of America v. Edward Snowden]\n\nThe 26-page lawsuit is separate from the criminal charges against Snowden, and it also names as defendants the companies involved in publishing the book: Macmillan Publishers, Henry Holt and Co. and Holtzbrinck Publishers. Spokespeople for the companies did not immediately return messages seeking comment. The suit notes it is only seeking Snowden\u2019s earnings or those given to his agents but names publishers because they are likely to control the funds.\n\nOn Twitter, Snowden noted the lawsuit with a link to buy the book, writing, \u201cThis is the book the government does not want you to read.\u201d He added later, \u201cIt is hard to think of a greater stamp of authenticity than the US government filing a lawsuit claiming your book is so truthful that it was literally against the law to write.\u201d\n\nThe suit details the secrecy agreements that Snowden signed with the CIA and NSA and asserts Snowden knew he had to submit for pre-publication review any materials he planned to publish about his government work.\n\n\u201cSnowden did not, at any time, submit the manuscript for Permanent Record to either the CIA or NSA for pre-publication review,\u201d the suit alleges. \u201cNor did Snowden obtain written approval from CIA or NSA prior to sharing manuscripts with Macmillan or prior to the book\u2019s publication.\u201d\n\nMacmillan promoted the book, published Tuesday, as a story of Snowden\u2019s time in the CIA and NSA and \u201cthe disillusionment he felt with the American intelligence establishment that led him to give up his future to share the truth about the U.S. government\u2019s pursuit of a mass surveillance system.\u201d\n\n[Book review: Snowden explains how he pulled off one of the largest leaks in U.S. history]\n\nBen Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberty Union\u2019s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project and an attorney for Snowden, said in a statement: \u201cThis book contains no government secrets that have not been previously published by respected news organizations. Had Mr. Snowden believed that the government would review his book in good faith, he would have submitted it for review. But the government continues to insist that facts that are known and discussed throughout the world are still somehow classified.\u201d\n\nJesselyn Radack, a whistleblower lawyer who has represented Snowden, said the government was \u201ctacitly recognizing\u201d that Snowden \u201chas a First Amendment right to speak and to publish,\u201d by not seeking to block distribution or publication of the book.\n\nBut she said that the lawsuit would nonetheless scare those in government who might want to share or comment on episodes of wrongdoing and noted that the government had chosen a venue \u2014 federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia \u2014 that has a reputation for aggressively pursuing those who share information. Snowden was charged there, as was WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.\n\n\u201cClearly, when the government does something like this, I would argue that it has a chilling effect on people\u2019s speech,\u201d Radack said.\n\nRadack said Snowden probably anticipated such a suit by the government and had \u201cworked out arrangements with the publisher about how to handle that,\u201d though she was uncertain of the details. But even if the government was able to take back earnings or prevent him from profiting, she said, Snowden was probably more concerned with sharing his story. It is unclear whether Snowden already has been paid any money for work on the book or, if so, what steps the government might be able to take to get it back.\n\n\u201cFor me, just knowing Ed, I don\u2019t think he was in this for the moneymaking-venture aspect of it,\u201d Radack said.\n\nWizner said Snowden hoped the lawsuit would \u201cbring the book to the attention of more readers throughout the world.\u201d\n\nThe case would not be the first time the government has sought proceeds from a former government official\u2019s book published without approvals. In 2016, the government reached an agreement with Matt Bissonnette, a former Navy SEAL, to take $6.8 million in royalties from his book, \u201cNo Easy Day,\u201d which detailed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.\n\nFormer government officials who go through the pre-publication review process often complain that it is an opaque and lengthy procedure. Five former federal employees recently filed a lawsuit over it, alleging it was an unconstitutional \u201csystem of censorship\u201d that is often politicized.", "description": "The department alleged the former NSA contractor violated nondisclosure agreements in publishing \u201cPermanent Record\u201d without the necessary government approvals.", "authors": ["Matt Zapotosky", "National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department", "September At Pm", "Matt Zapotosky Covers The Justice Department For The Washington Post'S National Security Team.
