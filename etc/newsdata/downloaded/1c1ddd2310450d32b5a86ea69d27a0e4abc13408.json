Biden dodged the question: He insisted he and his son did \u201cnothing wrong,\u201d that he was \u201cproud\u201d of his son\u2019s judgment, that people should really be focused on President Donald Trump\u2019s corruption, and something about George Washington.\n\nTrump\u2019s request in a July 25 phone call that the president of Ukraine investigate the Bidens is what prompted Democrats to officially open an impeachment inquiry. As the debate moderator noted in his question, there is no evidence that the Bidens had a corrupt arrangement in Ukraine. But both Joe and Hunter Biden seem aware of the poor optics. The former vice president has said he would ban his family and anyone associated with him from being \u201cinvolved in any foreign operation whatsoever\u201d if he were elected president. And Hunter acknowledged Tuesday, hours before the debate, that he used \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in taking the job.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks during the fourth Democratic presidential candidates' debate Tuesday in Westerville, Ohio.

I did nothing wrong,\u201d he started, even though Cooper had already said there was no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d Biden said multiple times before veering off on a tangent about Trump and the Founding Fathers:\n\nWhat I think is important is we focus on why it\u2019s so important to remove this man from office. On the 17th \u2015 look, the fact that George Washington worried, on the first time he spoke after being elected president, that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections. It was the greatest threat to America. This president on three occasions, three occasions, has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous. Rudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t want me to be the candidate. He is going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.\n\nCooper tried again. \u201cYour son Hunter today gave an interview and admitted that he made a mistake and showed poor judgment by serving on that board in Ukraine. Did you make a mistake by letting him? You were the point person on Ukraine at the time,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nBiden again insisted he did nothing wrong \u2014 and said that he was \u201cproud\u201d of his son\u2019s judgment.\n\n\u201cLook, my son\u2019s statement speaks for itself. I did my job. I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy son made a judgment. I\u2019m proud of the judgment he made. I\u2019m proud of what he had to say. And let\u2019s focus on this. The fact of the matter is that this is about Trump\u2019s corruption. That\u2019s what we should be focusing on.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nRead Live Updates From The 4th Democratic Presidential Debate\n\nBeto O'Rourke 'Cannot Fathom' Running For Office Again If He's Not The Nominee\n\nElizabeth Warren Blames Ukraine Scandal On Impeachment Inaction After Mueller Report\n\nKamala Harris Declares 'Women Will Die' If Reproductive Rights Aren't Protected\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
