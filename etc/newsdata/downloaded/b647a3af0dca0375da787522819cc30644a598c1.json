Nadler said his panel's primary focus would be determining whether Kavanaugh lied to the Senate.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

He said it was urgent to receive because of the potential for Kavanaugh to rule on policy matters that may have come up during his time in the White House.\n\nLast month, Nadler asked the National Archives to release a large cache of records related to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's time in George W. Bush's White House.\n\nNadler's comments on Kavanaugh preceded some of his strongest comments to date on impeaching Trump. Nadler emphasized that in his view, it's \"imperative\" that Trump be impeached to deter wrongdoing by future presidents. He also said Congress already has all the information it needs to make that decision. What's missing, he said, is educating the public on those findings.\n\n\"In my personal opinion, impeachment is imperative not because he's going to be removed from office \u2014 the Senate won't do that \u2014 but because we have to vindicate the Constitution,\" he said. \"We have to show that the kind of self-dealing enrichment that this president is engaged in ... that the kind of public corruption he's been involved in, that the kind of obstruction of justice that the Mueller report documented \u2014 five instances of which met all the requirements for an indictment and the president would have been indicted for those five instances had the Justice Department not had a policy of not indicting presidents no matter what -- we have to show that this kind of behavior \u2026 cannot be normalized.\"\n\nNadler's position on impeachment puts him much further ahead on the issue than Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has said the House must continue to investigate and litigate against Trump before making a determination on what to do. She's acknowledged that public sentiment does not favor impeachment but insists that the decision won't be political but rather based on the factual merits.\n\nNadler hinted at the divide among Democrats, noting that some of his colleagues are reluctant to use the terms \"impeachment inquiry\" or \"impeachment investigation\" to describe what the House is doing. Nadler, though, described a Tuesday hearing that his panel will convene on obstruction of justice allegations against Trump as an \"impeachment hearing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are involved in an investigation to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment to the House. That is what we're doing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe term impeachment investigation, the term impeachment inquiry have no legal meaning. Shorthand for an investigation into determining whether to recommend articles of impeachment. That's what we're doing and we're doing it officially.\u201d\n\n\"I have said this in very certain terms as many times as I can as definitely as I can now. Other people have, for various reasons, have been more reluctant -- been reluctant to use the term impeachment inquiry or impeachment investigation,\" he said. \"But as I've said those terms have no official meaning.\"\n\nAs for the prospect of an actual impeachment vote int he House, Nadler said there is a math challenge within the Democratic caucus to get 218 votes of support for impeachment.\n\n\"There's a maximum of 236 possible votes, namely 235 Democrats and Justin Amash\" \u2014 the former Republican who shed his party affiliation after coming out in support of Trump's removal, Nadler said. \"We have to through the hearings that we're going to hold now \u2014 a very aggressive series of hearings on very serious offenses committed by the president ... We have to show that there are adequate grounds for impeachment that there are imperative grounds for impeachment.\"\n\n", "description": "Jerry Nadler says the committee is too busy \"impeaching the president\" to consider investigating the Supreme Court justice.", "authors": ["Kyle Cheney"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fa/89/36cd0fa54de0a98859b34c2a3af6/190916-nadler-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
