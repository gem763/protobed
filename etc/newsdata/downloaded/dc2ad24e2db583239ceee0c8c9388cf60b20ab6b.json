Try getting a dog", "language": "en", "text": "So what exactly is it about owning a dog that would make people live longer?\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, cardiologist Dhruv Kazi of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center outlined some of the findings. For starters, there are well-documented mental health benefits to owning a pooch: \"Dogs offer companionship, reduce anxiety and loneliness, increase self-esteem, and improve overall mood,\" Kazi writes. The 2018 General Social Survey, for instance, found that dog owners were happier than cat owners.\n\nThen there are the physical benefits. \"Several studies have shown that acquiring a dog perforce increases physical exercise (as anyone who has unsuccessfully tried to sleep past the time of a dog's routine morning walk can attest),\" Kazi writes. People who own dogs tend to spend more time outdoors, which is known to be beneficial to health. Simply petting a dog - especially a familiar one - lowers a person's blood pressure.\n\nIt's plausible that such physical and mental health benefits are the pathway by which dog ownership makes a person live longer. One drawback in the literature, however, is that there haven't been any randomised controlled trials looking at dog ownership and mortality. Researchers haven't done many studies, for instance, that direct one group of people to buy a dog, and another group to remain petless, and track their health over a period of time. Those types of studies are considered the gold standard of evidence, what you'd need to be able to say definitively that owning a dog causes people to live longer.\n\nYou'd want to do this to rule out confounding factors. \"Pet owners tend to be younger, wealthier, better educated, and more likely to be married, all of which improve cardiovascular outcomes,\" Kazi writes. It may be the case that being healthier and wealthier causes people to be more likely to acquire a dog.\n\nStill, Kazi writes, the balance of the evidence so far convinces him that \"the association between dog ownership and improved survival is real, and is likely at least partially causal\". One of the larger studies included in the review controlled for a variety of socio-economic and demographic factors and found that the longevity effect of dog ownership remained.\n\nThere also have been several randomised controlled studies on pet ownership in general, showing direct benefits of owning an animal. In one, a group of cardiac patients who had been randomly instructed to acquire a dog or a cat showed a diminished blood pressure response to stressful situations. In another, researchers randomly assigned nursing home residents in Korea pet crickets and directed them to care for the insects for eight weeks. After that time, the cricket-caring group showed significant improvements on measures of depression and cognitive ability, relative to the control group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The most salient benefits of dog ownership on cardiovascular outcomes,\" Kazi writes, \"are likely mediated through large and sustained improvements in mental health, including lower rates of depression, decreased loneliness, and increased self-esteem.\"\n\nThough the current study didn't examine the effects of cat ownership on mortality, at least one previous paper has explored the connection and found that cat ownership, too, is linked to a decrease in fatal cardiovascular events.\n\nThat suggests that if you're really serious about living a long life, you should get a dog and a cat to cover all your bases.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "A new study published in the journal of the American Heart Association reviews several decades of evidence on the relationship between dog ownership and mortality.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_81/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8f8e0fef1c84cfc9f30f621c959fe8b739ba7b75", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
