Shape Created with Sketch. 20 directors who hate their own films 1/20 American History X \u2013 Tony Kaye There are few directors who have gone so actively out of their way to discourage people from watching their film as Tony Kaye. Unhappy with the way the studio, New Line, had re-cut American History X, the filmmaker wrote multiple open letters \u2013 published by the trade press \u2013 telling people to not watch the final version. He even had the film pulled from Toronto Film Festival. \u201cI had tried to get my name taken off it, and replaced with various pseudonyms,\u201d Kaye wrote in The Guardian, three years after the release. \u201cOne was \u2018Humpty Dumpty\u2019. Another was \u2018Ralph Coates\u2019, who played for Tottenham in the 1970s.\u201d The Directors Guild of America would not allow Kaye to change his name, and he has bitterly lived with the accolade of directing the cult classic ever since. 2/20 Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen \u2013 Michael Bay The first Transformers was a decent-enough popcorn flick. Critics may not have been enamoured by the CGI blockbuster, but there\u2019s no denying watching robots beating each other up is mindless entertainment of the highest order. Yet, Michael Bay managed to make a mess of that simple winning formula in the sequel, Revenge of the Fallen, something he later admitted. \"When I look back at it, that was crap,\u201d he said of the film in 2011. \u201cThe writers' strike was coming hard and fast. It was just terrible to do a movie where you've got to have a story in three weeks. I was prepping a movie for months where I only had 14 pages of some idea of what the movie was. It's a BS way to make a movie.\u201d 3/20 The Snowman \u2013 Tomas Alfredson While Swedish director Tomas Alfredson received acclaim for the Oscar-nominated Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, his follow-up film, the mystery thriller The Snowman, was ripped apart by critics. \u201cOur shoot time in Norway was way too short,\u201d he explained following the film\u2019s release. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get the whole story with us and when we started cutting we discovered that a lot was missing.\u201d Alfredson added that, despite The Snowman being in development for years, with Martin Scorsese once attached as director, around 10 to 15 per cent of the script was not filmed. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you\u2019re making a big jigsaw puzzle and a few pieces are missing so you don\u2019t see the whole picture,\u201d he added. 4/20 Avengers: Age of Ultron \u2013 Joss Whedon Joss Whedon changed cinema with The Avengers. The ensemble film brought a host of disparate superheroes together, and in the process made over $1.5 billion (\u00a31.15 billion) at the box-office. Balancing all those characters was tough, and come the sequel, Age of Ultron, the director was worn down. Whedon apparently couldn\u2019t muster the ability to watch the entire film after completion, saying: \u201cI\u2019m tied and I had a terrible time.\u201d A year later, in 2016, the filmmaker clarified his comments. \u201cI was so beaten down by the process. Some of that was conflicting with Marvel, which is inevitable. A lot of it was about my own work, and I was also exhausted.\u201d Whedon added that he remains \u201cproud\u201d of the film, yet there are still things about the film that \u201cfrustrate\u201d him hugely. 5/20 Annie Hall, Hannah And Her Sisters, Manhattan \u2013 Woody Allen Annie Hall is widely regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Hannah And Her Sisters won an Oscar for best screenplay. Manhattan is often heralded as a comedy masterpiece. Woody Allen, though, believes his other films are better. \u201cFor some reason [Annie Hall] is very likeable. I\u2019ve made better films than that. Match Point is a better film, Purple Rose of Cairo is a better film, the French one \u2013 Midnight in Paris \u2013 is a better film, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is as good. I mean, I\u2019ve made films that were as good, but for some reason that\u2019s got some charismatic, inexplicable hold on people. That and Manhattan too. [On] Manhattan, I missed what I was going for. Same thing with Hannah and Her Sisters. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a terrible film or a bad \u2013 I\u2019m not here to knock my films. But for me personally, I missed. It was too treacly at the end, too bailed-out.\u201d 6/20 Highball \u2013 Noah Baumbach Noah Baumbach is now a beloved indie filmmaker (thanks to The Squid and the Whale, Frances Ha, and The Meyerowitz Stories). Yet he was not always an acclaimed director. Baumbach despised his second film, Highball, so much that his directing credit was changed to Ernie Fusco and his writer\u2019s one to Jesse Carter. \u201cIt was just too ambitious,\u201d he said of the film, which concerns a newly married couple who end up inviting too many people to their Brooklyn flat for a party. \u201cWe didn't have enough time, we didn't finish it, it didn't look good, it was just a whole ... mess. We couldn't get it done, and I had a falling out with the producer. He abandoned it, and I had no money to finish it, to go back and maybe get two more days or something. Then later, it was put out on DVD without my approval.\u201d 7/20 Babylon AD \u2013 Mathieu Kassovitz Before Babylon AD \u2013 a futuristic sci-fi flick about a mercenary who has to escort a woman from Russia to America \u2013 reached cinemas in the UK, the director, Mathieu Kassovitz, was trying to distance himself from the Vin Diesel-led project. \"The movie is supposed to teach us that the education of our children will mean the future of our planet,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the action scenes had a goal: they were supposed to be driven by either a metaphysical point of view or experience for the characters... instead parts of the movie are like a bad episode of 24.\" Kassovitz later added the film was \"pure violence and stupidity\". 8/20 Catchfire \u2013 Dennis Hopper In 1992, Dennis Hopper joined the ranks of directors who released their film under the pseudonym Alan Smithee (famously used when filmmakers disown their own film). Originally called Catchfire, the Jodie Foster-starring thriller about a woman who enters witness protection was later retitled Backtrack, and 20 minutes were cut for the straight-to-VHS release. Hopper rarely spoke about the film; he wanted to distance himself as much as possible from the doomed project. 9/20 The Underneath \u2013 Steven Soderbergh \u201cI think it\u2019s a beautiful film to look at and I think the score is beautiful,\u201d Steven Soderberg said of The Underneath, \u201cbut 15 seconds in I know we\u2019re in trouble because of how f***ing long it takes to get through those opening credits. That\u2019s just an indication of what\u2019s wrong with this thing: it\u2019s just totally sleepy.\u201d The film, about a recovering gambling addict, was an unsurprising box-office flop. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019d recommend it to anyone,\u201d Soderbergh added, \u201cother than to look at in the context of someone\u2019s career\u201d. 10/20 Thor: The Dark World \u2013 Alan Taylor Alan Taylor \u2013 of Game of Thrones and Sopranos fame \u2013 seemed a perfect fit for Thor, the heroic God of Thunder who spoke in Shakespearean prose. When the sequel was released, many were disappointed with the film, which somehow wasted Christopher Eccleston, who played the villain. Taylor later criticised the project, saying: \u201cThe Marvel experience was particularly wrenching because I was sort of given absolute freedom while we were shooting, and then in post it turned into a different movie. So, that is something I hope never to repeat and don\u2019t wish upon anybody else.\u201d Marvel 11/20 Fear and Desire \u2013 Stanley Kubrick Few filmmakers have spotless filmographies. Stanley Kubrick believed the blotch on his was Fear and Desire \u2013 the renowned-perfectionist\u2019s cinematic debut. As his stature as a director grew, Kubrick was said to grow ever-more disgruntled with Fear and Desire, an anti-war film about four soldiers trapped behind enemy lines. Reports emerged in the Sixties that Kubrick had destroyed the original negative print, and was hoping to destroy all leftover prints. In 1964, Kubrick called the film \u201ca serious effort, ineptly done\u201d. 12/20 Batman and Robin \u2013 Joel Schumacher Almost everyone involved with Batman & Robin seems to hate the final product. George Clooney has apologised for his Bat-nippled version of the Caped Crusader, while director Joel Schumacher has said sorry multiple times. \u201cLook, I apologise,\u201d he said in 2017. \u201cI want to apologise to every fan that was disappointed because I think I owe them that.\u201d After the widely maligned film reached cinemas, Schumacher said he was treated like \u201cscum\u201d. \u201cIt was like I had murdered a baby,\u201d he continued. 13/20 The Day the Clown Cried \u2013 Jerry Lewis Jerry Lewis\u2019s The Day the Clown Cried has never been released. The director, who also starred as the leading character, locked the film \u2013 about a clown arrested in Nazi Germany for drunkenly defaming Hitler \u2013 in a private vault after completion. Lewis thought the film was so \u201cbad, bad, bad\u201d that he often refused to discuss the project, only commenting very occasionally. \"I was ashamed of the work and I was grateful I had the power to contain it all and never let anyone see it. It could have been wonderful but I slipped up \u2013 I didn't quite get it,\u201d he said in 2013. AFP 14/20 Fantastic Four \u2013 Josh Trank Everything was looking good for Fantastic Four before filming began. Some of Hollywood\u2019s most promising actors were playing the eponymous characters \u2013 Michael B Jordan, Miles Teller, Kate Mara and Jamie Bell \u2013 while Josh Trank, coming off the back of runaway success Chronicle, was hired to direct. During post-production, though, everything fell apart. Trank was forced by the studio, Fox, to do extensive reshoots (you can tell which scenes were reshot because Mara\u2019s wig looks awful and Teller has varying lengths of stubble). The month before the film\u2019s release, the director spoke out on Twitter. \u201cA year ago I had a fantastic version of this,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd it would\u2019ve received great reviews. You\u2019ll probably never see it. That\u2019s reality though.\u201d The film bombed at the box office, with Trank\u2019s tweet reportedly costing Fox between $5m and $10m (\u00a33.8m and \u00a37.6m). 15/20 Woman Wanted \u2013 Kiefer Sutherland During the Nineties, Kiefer Sutherland wanted to progress from acting to directing. Although his feature-film debut as director, 1997\u2019s Truth or Consequences, was not exactly a critical success, he persevered, directing the 2000 flick Woman Wanted. Sutherland was so disappointed with the results, he released the film under the pseudonym Alan Smithee \u2013 becoming the last person to ever use the famed name. He has not directed a film since. 16/20 An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn \u2013 Alan Smithee/Arthur Hiller A film about the pseudonym Alan Smithee that ironically ended up being an Alan Smithee film. Arthur Hiller had no intention of disowning Burn Hollywood Burn, which aimed to lampoon the Hollywood system. The film centred on a director, named Alan Smithee (played by Eric Idle), who hands in a cut of a film, only for the studio to recut the entire thing. Life mirrored art as the studio behind Burn Hollywood Burn took the film away from Hiller, who ended up using the Smithee pseudonym on the release. 17/20 Dune \u2013 David Lynch Following the success of Oscar Best Picture winner The Elephant Man, David Lynch could have done almost anything. Despite having not read the book, Lynch agreed to adapt Dune, choosing the project over the third Star Wars, Return of the Jedi. Lynch soon started work on turning Frank Herbert\u2019s epic novel into a screenplay, turning in over five drafts. Yet, despite the preparation time, the final results were less than satisfactory for the director. \u201cI started selling out on Dune,\u201d he said. \u201cLooking back, it's no one's fault but my own. I probably shouldn't have done that picture, but I saw tons and tons of possibilities for things I loved, and this was the structure to do them in.\u201d 18/20 Alien 3 \u2013 David Fincher David Fincher was just 28 years old when the producers of Alien decided to bring the upstart on board their second sequel. With just five weeks\u2019 preparation time, an unfinished script, and no real clout behind his name, Fincher struggled with the film. \u201cOh, it was just awful,\u201d he later said. \u201cThis is the worst thing that ever happened to me.\u201d In 2009, promoting The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Fincher elaborated: \u201cI had to work on it for two years, got fired off it three times and I had to fight for every single thing. No one hated it more than me; to this day, no one hates it more than me.\u201d 19/20 Hellraiser: Bloodline \u2013 Kevin Yagher The fourth film in the horror series Hellraiser had a troubled production. Original director Kevin Yagher was ordered by the studio to reshoot scenes, which he refused to do. Joe Chappelle stepped in, leading to Yagher demanding the Alan Smithee pseudonym be used. The final film \u2013 which acted as both a prequel and a sequel to the other three films \u2013 was not screened for critics, and was dismissed by many fans. 20/20 Accidental Love \u2013 David O Russell David O Russell began working on Nailed in 2008. Envisioning the film as a romantic comedy with political undertones, the director cast Jessica Biel and Jake Gyllenhaal in leading roles, and was awarded $26 million (\u00a320 million) to make it. And still, somehow, the entire filming process was a mess. The set was shutdown a reported 14 times after cast and crew complained about not being paid. Eventually, after key scenes were not filmed during production, the entire thing was abandoned. After Russell started drawing Oscars attention for The Fighter and American Hustle, though, the studio wanted to get Nailed out in cinemas. Work continued on the film without Russell\u2019s involvement. The film was then retitled Accidental Love and released in cinemas, with the director\u2019s name changed to Stephen Greene. Critics hated the results. 1/20 American History X \u2013 Tony Kaye There are few directors who have gone so actively out of their way to discourage people from watching their film as Tony Kaye. Unhappy with the way the studio, New Line, had re-cut American History X, the filmmaker wrote multiple open letters \u2013 published by the trade press \u2013 telling people to not watch the final version.
