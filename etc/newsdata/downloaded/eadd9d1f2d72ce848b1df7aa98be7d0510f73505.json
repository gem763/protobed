REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - The nominee to become the European Union\u2019s next economic commissioner pledged \u201cadequate\u201d fiscal efforts on Thursday to counter the risks of an economic slowdown in the bloc.\n\nIn his confirmation hearing before EU lawmakers, Italy\u2019s Paolo Gentiloni reiterated that he would seek to use the leeway allowed by EU fiscal rules to permit governments to invest for growth and would also target a reduction of public debt.\n\nHe said the next European Commission would decide on the recommended fiscal stance for the euro zone after it releases new economic forecasts on November 7.\n\nThe bloc has currently a \u201cbroadly neutral\u201d fiscal stance, despite pressure from some countries for more expansionary plans to counter recession risks. The European Central Bank also backs a more expansionary fiscal stance.\n\nGentiloni said the Commission\u2019s recommendation would depend on the \u201cseriousness and duration of the slowdown\u201d which will emerge from the EU forecasts.\n\nHe also called for a review of EU fiscal rules that would make them simpler and urged an \u201cambitious\u201d funding plan for an EU unemployment reinsurance scheme.\n\nThe bloc is currently debating whether to fund this scheme with loans or with more generous grants to states with high unemployment levels.", "description": "The nominee to become the European Union's next economic commissioner pledged \"adequate\" fiscal efforts on Thursday to counter the risks of an economic slowdown in the bloc.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436548043&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920F6"}
