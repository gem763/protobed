Facebook (52%) dominates among social sites people say they use to get news content, followed by YouTube (28%), Twitter (17%), and Instagram (14%). Business Insider Intelligence\n\nSpecifically, US adults feel that social media presents a \"worse\" overall mix of news content compared with other options. Over half (55%) say that accessing news content via social platforms results in a \"worse\" overall mix of news content, with just 15% saying it results in a \"better\" mix. Social media feeds are controlled by algorithms that surface content it thinks a user will be most interested in, based on past engagement on the platform.\n\nThis algorithmic sorting has been shown to result in the phenomenon of \"filter bubbles,\" in which a user's news selection is highly personalized to maximize engagement, but also likely to present a lopsided view of current events as a result. Rising wariness about the quality of their news mix on social platforms could be the result of US adults growing more aware of the narrowing effect algorithms have on what they see. That frustration could also be a function of rising consumer distrust in tech to control the flow of information generally: 65% of respondents say that tech companies have too much power to determine what news and information people see or not, per Edelman.\n\nStill, it's unlikely that US news consumers will shift their habits any time soon, and new pushes into human-curated news could help social platforms guarantee that.While social sites face some competition from emerging news aggregation apps like SmartNews, with about 15 million global MAU, these apps are unlikely to ever match the reach of global sites like Facebook (2.4 billion MAU), YouTube (2+ billion) LinkedIn (645 million), Instagram (1 billion), and Twitter (139 monetizable DAU).\n\nUltimately, even though news consumers might be frustrated with the quality of the news experience on social platforms, the convenience of finding news on platforms will likely be enough to keep them there: 21% of social news consumers say the thing they like most about getting news on social sites is the convenience, the top response, per Pew.\n\nDespite this advantage, social platforms aren't betting on convenience alone. Later this month, Facebook will launch a dedicated, human-curated section for news content called News Tab that will include links to stories from about 200 publications. And Snapchat is reportedly in \"early talks\" with publishers to launch a dedicated news tab on its platform, per the Information. If social platforms can boost the news consumption experience in a way that builds trust \u2014 like by relying on more editor-curated, dedicated news zones, for example \u2014 social sites might not only maintain their status but add to it.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
