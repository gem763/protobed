Trump will repeatedly remind his supporters that, after two partisan witch hunts perpetrated by unscrupulous antagonists with little regard for evidence and less for ethics, he is still standing and ready to take on any challenger the Democrats nominate. Moreover, he will hang the embarrassingly inept Mueller investigation and the inevitable implosion of impeachment around the neck of that unfortunate candidate. Trump will force him to explain why the Democrats wasted two years in the House and accomplished nothing but failed attempts to oust him.\n\nThe 2020 Democratic nominee will be Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, or Bernie Sanders. All of these people have called for Trump\u2019s impeachment. Two of the three are, inconveniently, members of the upper chamber of Congress that will eventually acquit him. If Biden is the nominee, the President will remind voters that the former VP is on video bragging about doing exactly what he calls an impeachable offense in Trump\u2019s case \u2014 threatening to withhold aid to Ukraine in a quid pro quo arrangement. Ironically, impeachment is actually a blessing in disguise for the Trump campaign.
