The Benn Act required him to send a letter to the president of the European Council seeking an extension, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s done. The act doesn\u2019t require that he sign the letter,\u201d Pannick said, referring to law asking him to request a delay.\n\n\u201cThe Benn act has achieved its purpose. The act doesn\u2019t require the prime minister to abandon his political objectives, his political beliefs, that we should leave on the 31st.\u201d\n\nPannick said he had assisted lawmaker Oliver Letwin in drafting the amendment which derailed Johnson\u2019s plans for a vote on his Brexit deal on Saturday.\n\nThe amendment said that lawmakers would withhold approval for Brexit until legislation to deliver Brexit was in place, meaning parliament had not approved a deal and that a extension had to be requested under the terms of the Benn Act.\n\nScotland\u2019s highest court will sit on Monday to consider whether Johnson has complied with the Benn Act. Anti-Brexit campaigners who brought the case said they wanted the court to delay its ruling to see how negotiations with the EU play out.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is on the right side of the law after he reluctantly sent a letter requesting a Brexit delay at his opponents' behest, a lawyer who has worked on high-profile cases challenging the government said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
