I apologise ahead for the tech talk, but if it the SSD is NVME, which I suspect it will be for the improved UI, then I\u2019d expect it to be only a 500GB SSD, because 1TB would add 33% onto the base price. The CPU will likely be based on Ryzen Zen 2, which isn\u2019t actually priced ridiculously. However, 4K Blu-ray drives appear to be \u00a3100+ and the current GPUs available that feature ray-tracing start at just shy of \u00a3300.\n\nNow, I\u2019m aware that Sony will be dealing directly with suppliers, prices on components should fall between now and when the console is being mass produced, and Sony doesn\u2019t look to make a profit from hardware on day one, but I\u2019d be surprised if the PlayStation 5 is less than \u00a3450.\n\nIn fact, I think a likely launch price is \u00a3499. Sony have had a great generation with the PlayStation 4 but it wasn\u2019t too long ago, March 2007 to be precise, that the PlayStation 3 launched at a staggering \u00a3425 in the UK. On the Continent it was priced at \u20ac599! Now that the exchange rate has swung so far the other way, perhaps it\u2019s going to be higher than \u00a3500! Who knows. What are GC\u2019s and other reader\u2019s predictions?\n\nMatt\n\nGC: We could see them going for a more expensive console if they had a streaming service like Project xCloud to balance it out and act as the cheaper option. Whether that will be possible at launch though, there\u2019s no way of guessing at the moment.", "description": "The Thursday Inbox is very excited about the prospect of PlayStation VR 2, as one reader recommends Yooka-Laylee And The Impossible Lair.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image12_1570657121.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
