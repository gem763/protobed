She likened it to the extreme control over women in Gilead, the theocratic future United States where both \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cThe Testaments\u201d are set.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the legislative moves made by a number of different states within the United States, you can see that some of them are almost there,\u201d Atwood said at London\u2019s British Library during a publication-day news conference.\n\nWhen \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d was published in 1985, some readers found the idea of a fundamentalist state supplanting the democratic United States far-fetched. Now, with authoritarianism on the rise around the world, it strikes many as eerily prescient.\n\nAtwood said she wasn\u2019t a prophet, just observant.\n\n\u201cIn 1985, people were already saying these kinds of things,\u201d Atwood said. \u201c(Politicians) were talking about what they would like to do in the United States if they had the power. And now they do have the power.\u201d\n\nAtwood says she long resisted revisiting the world of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d because she didn\u2019t think she could recapture the voice of narrator Offred, a \u201chandmaid\u201d compelled to bear children for a powerful man.\n\nThe success of the Emmy Award-winning \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d television series starring Elisabeth Moss - and renewed interest in the novel from the TV drama - may have helped change the writer\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cThe Testaments\u201d is set about 15 years on from where \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d ends with Offred fleeing to an undetermined future. It has three narrators, including Aunt Lydia, one of Gilead\u2019s fearsome enforcers, who features in both book and series of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d\n\nThe author says the follow-up tells the story of \u201cthe beginning of the end\u201d of Gilead.\n\nThe TV series that first aired in 2017 has helped make Atwood\u2019s Gilead a cultural touchstone. Demonstrators at women\u2019s rights protests routinely don the red cloaks and bonnets of the show\u2019s handmaids.\n\nIntriguingly, the dominant color of \u201cThe Testaments,\u201d splashed on the book\u2019s cover and ad campaign, is bright green.\n\n\u201cThere are some new costume choices in the book,\u201d Atwood said. \u201cThese kinds of regimes are very big on outfits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Testaments\u201d is sure to be one of the year\u2019s biggest books, and the months leading up to its publication were surrounded by secrecy - and security.\n\nAtwood says she and the publishers were targeted in cyberattacks aimed at stealing the manuscript. Publisher Penguin\u2019s tight pre-publication procedures were slightly compromised when Amazon sent some customers copies early. Amazon apologized for the \u201ctechnical glitch.\u201d\n\nThe book was launched with \u201cHarry Potter\u201d levels of hype: midnight festivities in British book stores, a press conference for international journalists and a celebrity-studded evening gala broadcast to 1,300 movie theaters around the world.\n\nThe novel is on the shortlist for the prestigious Booker Prize - Atwood\u2019s sixth time as a Booker finalist. She has won the prize once (for \u201cThe Blind Assassin\u201d in 2000), along with a slew of other awards including Canada\u2019s Governor General\u2019s Award and the PEN/Pinter free-speech prize.\n\nShe\u2019s long been considered a favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature. When British writer Kazuo Ishiguro won in 2017, he said \u201cI apologize to Margaret Atwood that it\u2019s not her getting this prize.\u201d\n\nAtwood was introduced at a news conference Tuesday as a \u201cliterary rock star.\u201d\n\nAtwood, who turns 80 in November, said she is \u201cpleased and grateful,\u201d but unfazed.\n\n\u201cI think this kind of thing can be quite ruinous for a 35-year-old,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause where do you go from there? In my case, I think we know the answer.\u201d\n\nShe has no immediate plans for another installment but has not ruled out a third trip to Gilead.\n\n\u201cI never say never to anything, because I have said \u2018never\u2019 and been wrong,\u201d Atwood said.\n\n___\n\nAn earlier version of this story misspelled the first name of Elisabeth Moss.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Margaret Atwood often gets asked if \"The Testaments,\" her sequel to \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" is set in a dystopian world.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jill Lawless"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/britain_atwood_82186_c0-0-4723-2753_s1770x1032.jpg?88e75030e82155b6cff9928b136d442dd8d57b1d", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
