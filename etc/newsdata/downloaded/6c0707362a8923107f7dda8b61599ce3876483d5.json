despite breaking a manifesto pledge to save the lifeline.\n\nThe Prime Minister was tackled over the Tory betrayal as over-75s face forking out to watch their favourite shows.\n\nThe Conservatives promised to preserve the benefit - but had already thrown it into jeopardy after stitching up a deal for the BBC to take responsiblity for funding the \u00a3745million-a-year cost from next June.\n\nCampaigners have piled pressure on the PM to stump up the cash so over-75s can continue to receive free licences.\n\nHighlighting the Tories\u2019 \u201cmanifesto commitment at the last general election to implement free television licences for the over-75s\u201d, Labour MP Jim Cunningham asked Mr Johnson: \u201cWhen is something going to be done about it?\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nBut instead of facing up to the 2017 election commitment, the Conservative leader launched a fresh attack on the corporation.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe BBC has the funds, as he knows full well.\n\n\u201cIt is there, they should be funding those free TV licences and we continue to make that argument very vigorously with the BBC - and believe me, he asked me to put the screws on the BBC, we certainly will.\u201d\n\nBectu broadcasting union chief Philippa Childs said: \u201c Boris Johnson knows very well the BBC doesn\u2019t have the funds to fully cover the cost of this welfare benefit.\n\n\u201cThe Conservative Government cynically outsourced its social responsibility for over-75s free TV licences to the BBC as part of the last licence fee settlement but it was clear the public service broadcaster would not be able to fund that in full.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cFor the Prime Minister to suggest otherwise is simply not true.\n\n\u201cBectu members working there will be extremely concerned to hear the PM threaten to \u2018put the screws on the BBC\u2019 - as should the general public be if they appreciate the value of a public service broadcaster free from political interference.\u201d\n\nThe Conservatives promised at the 2017 election to protect the benefit for the rest of the Parliament, due to run until 2022.\n\nBut the BBC was handed responsibility for funding the lifeline from June 2020, under a deal stitched up in 2015.\n\nIt plans to curb the benefit, meaning just 1.5 million OAPs are likely to continue receiving free licences when restrictions take effect.\n\nFrom next June, only over-75s receiving Pension Credit will be eligible - meaning 80% of over-75s, some 3.7 million people, will have to stump up \u00a3154.50 to watch their favourite shows.\n\nLast month, the Mirror revealed how TV licence con men are targeting pensioners ahead of restrictions on the benefit.\n\nFraudsters are contacting OAPs in a scam aimed at swindling the elderly who face having to cough up.\n\n(Image: PA Wire/PA Images)\n\nSpeaking at PMQs , Labour backbencher Chris Elmore said \u201cthe elderly and the vulnerable are more at risk from scamming than ever before\u201d - and the scrapping of free licences \u201cputs them at further risk of scamming\u201d.\n\nFraudsters are poised \u201cto go door to door collecting the licence fee once the Government\u2019s decision has been implemented\u201d, he warned.\n\nThe PM suggested the 20,000 police officers being recruited could target TV licence con men.\n\nBut Deputy Labour Leader Tom Watson said: \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace that this Prime Minister would rather waste police officers\u2019 time up with mopping up the mess he\u2019s made, than just step up, admit his cruel policy is a mistake and save free TV licences today.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cTime and time again this Prime Minister resorts to his usual bluster to avoid taking responsibility for scrapping free TV licences.\n\n\u201cBut this attempt to pull the wool over the public\u2019s eyes just won\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cWe know the truth - the Tories promised to keep free TV licences for over-75s but they have completely refused to fund them.\n\n\u201cNow 3.7 million older people face losing their free TV licences next year.\u201d\n\nThe Mirror is campaigning to save the lifeline, with more than 18,000 readers backing the fight by completing coupons in the paper.\n\nMore than 600,000 have signed Age UK\u2019s Switched Off petition calling for free licences to be preserved and the Government to take back responsibility.\n\nAge UK charity director Caroline Abrahams said: \u201cIt\u2019s great the Prime Minister wants free TV licences to continue for our over-75s but his administration needs to do something more useful about it than just keep repeating it\u2019s all down to the BBC.\n\n\u201cThe Government needs to live up to its responsibility to sit down with the corporation to sort this issue out once and for all, particularly since the free TV licence has been a universal welfare entitlement since its creation, until a previous administration rather shamefully shunted it onto the BBC, without it seems giving them the money to fund it.\n\n\u201cOlder people deserve a lot better than to be stuck in the middle between the Government and the BBC.\u201d", "description": "The Prime Minister was tackled over the Tory betrayal as over-75s face forking out", "authors": ["Ben Glaze", "Image", "Getty", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Pa Wire Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20561718.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS186004548.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
