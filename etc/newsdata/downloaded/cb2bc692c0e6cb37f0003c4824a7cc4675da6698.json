Of course, this could very easily be a fight to the death \u2013 with Moira (Natalie J Robb) trapped in the depths of the lake and the boat about to be obliterated by an explosion, not everyone might make it out of the big fight alive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if they do, there are lots of questions to be answered. Why is Faith so troubled \u2013 has she recognised the woman Cain slept with or has she realised that Nate has the wrong end of the stick?\n\nIf Nate is indeed Cain\u2019s son, then who is the mother? And did Cain know that he had a child out there?\n\nFaith\u2019s definitely his mum, they did air her in the scenes for no reason, come on guys \u2014 Connor Byrne (@connorbyrne83) October 23, 2019\n\nI have this strong feeling that Faith is Nate's mum.. by the look on her face. #Emmerdale \u2014 Lauren (@BeauchampLove) October 23, 2019\n\nI don\u2019t think Nate is cains son, either he is faiths son or faith helped with his fake adoption and used cains name and that\u2019s how faith leaves #Emmerdale \u2014 Leanne White (@Mammy_white) October 22, 2019\n\nSo much intrigue \u2013 but whatever Faith is hiding, it leads to her being driven out of the village for some time, potentially forever. Sally confirmed her exit from the show to Metro.co.uk, indicating that Nate\u2019s true identity would the cause of Faith \u2018having to go away for a little while\u2019.\n\nWhile Sally is up for returning to the role, no confirmation at this stage has been made whether the exit is permanent. But it seems clear that there is more drama to come before she goes anywhere.\n\nEmmerdale continues on Wednesday 23rd October at 7pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Fans are guessing that all is not as it seems.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/faith-cain-4-7ea0_1571824065.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
