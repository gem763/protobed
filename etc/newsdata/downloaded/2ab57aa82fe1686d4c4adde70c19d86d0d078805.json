The service, also sometimes referred to by acronyms in Russian or Uzbek, changed its name to State Security Service last year but is still often referred to abroad as NSS.\n\nAccording to two people with knowledge of the attacks, the targets of the NSS have included regional news outlets Fergana News, Eltuz, Centre1 and the Palestine Chronicle, all of which report on the Uzbek government. The publishers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nBartholomew, speaking at the Virus Bulletin cybersecurity conference in London, said he was able to attribute the activity directly because of mistakes the hackers made covering their tracks online. In some cases they tested their attacks on computers running Kaspersky\u2019s antivirus software.\n\nIn one case, Kaspersky traced a cyber attack it was investigating to a domain listed in a public registry as belonging to a man named O.T. Khodzhakbarov. He had listed his organisation in the directory as \u201cMilitary Unit 02616\u201d.\n\nPublicly-available Uzbek business records show Military Unit 02616 is a state-owned entity. A person called Omonillakhon Tulkunovich Khodzhakbarov is named as an NSS officer in an Uzbek presidential degree awarding him a military honour in 2005.\n\nThe NSS did not respond to questions submitted via the Uzbek Foreign Ministry and Uzbek embassy in London. Reuters was unable to reach Khodzhakbarov for comment and the Uzbek presidential administration did not respond to questions about his role at the NSS or the award he received.\n\nKaspersky said it had detected Unit 02616 carrying out attacks using software from German firm FinFisher. FinFisher did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nEmails from an Italian spyware vendor, Hacking Team, posted on Wikileaks in 2015, showed that the NSS was a customer. After a merger this year, the company is now part of Swiss-Italian cyber intelligence firm Memento Labs, whose head, Paolo Lezzi, said the Uzbek government was not currently a customer and he had no knowledge of Hacking Team\u2019s former operations.\n\nHOMEGROWN HACKING\n\nUzbekistan, a former Soviet republic of 32 million people in Central Asia, has made efforts to improve its human rights record following the death of President Islam Karimov, who ruled the country from 1989 until he died in 2016.\n\nBut the government is still regularly criticised by human rights groups over its actions against dissidents, including reports of torture and widespread surveillance of journalists and other activists.\n\nClaudio Guarnieri, head of Amnesty International\u2019s Security Lab project, said Uzbek authorities were known to target \u201cpeople who are outspoken and critical about the conduct of the government\u201d with cyber attacks in an effort to discredit them with compromising material.\n\nKaspersky\u2019s Bartholomew declined to identify any specific targets of the NSS hacking but said the unit was attacking \u201chuman rights activists, journalists and other dissidents. We didn\u2019t see much outside the country, it was internally focused.\u201d\n\nAs well as purchasing off-the-shelf hacking tools, Unit 02616 began developing its own framework called \u201cSharpa\u201d in October 2018 to hack computers and mobile phones, Bartholomew said. It is not clear whether the system has yet been used in any attacks.\n\nBill Marczak, a senior research fellow at Canada\u2019s Citizen Lab research group, said it was common practice for customers of commercial spyware vendors to invest in efforts to develop their own in-house tools.\n\n\u201cUzbekistan\u2019s NSS has been on our radar for some time as an organisation that\u2019s been interested in acquiring offensive hacking tools,\u201d he said.\n\nCountries like this want to \u201cadvance their hacking capabilities quickly so they turn to outside vendors,\u201d he added. \u201cBut the goal is always to eventually become more independent.\u201d", "description": "Uzbek intelligence officers have used commercially-available computer spying tools to launch a series of cyber attacks against activists and dissidents, researchers at Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Jack Stubbs", "Christopher Bing", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436603704&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920RE"}
