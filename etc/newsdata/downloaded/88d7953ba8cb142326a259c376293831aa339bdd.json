Pete Ricketts signs a bill passed by the state legislature last week.\n\nThe state requires 490 days of schooling to become a licensed cosmetologist. Students have to learn how to apply makeup, style and color hair and must pass a licensing exam to become a licensed cosmetologist.\n\nHair-braiding is barely taught in most cosmetology schools, but anyone wanting to make a few dollars by braiding hair \u2013 a practice most common in African-American communities, where traditional hair-braiding has been taught for centuries \u2013 has to go through the cosmetology licensing process.\n\nThose 2,100 hours of training can cost as much as $20,000 in tuition and fees. Getting licensed also requires a high school diploma or GED, as if passing algebra was essential to understanding how to braid hair.\n\n\u201cTo put it simply, this is ridiculous,\u201d said Jessica Herrmann, director of legislative outreach for the Platte Institute of Economic Research. \u201cHair braiders must not only obtain permission from the government, but also spend thousands of dollars on course instruction on coloring, men and women\u2019s cutting, waxing, home creative skills, skin and spa services and chemistry. This burdensome regulation creates a huge financial barrier to entry for this new class of entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nBut skipping that lengthy and expensive process means facing the potential penalties for being an unlicensed cosmetologist. Those include fines of up to $25,000 and the potential of four years in prison.\n\nHair braiders won\u2019t have to worry about those punishments after July 1 if the new rules take effect. Hair braiding, along with the application of hair extensions and topical treatments like shampoos and conditioners, will no longer require any sort of license in Nebraska.\n\nThe bill\u2019s passage \u201cwill help small, mostly minority, owned businesses by removing an unfair and expensive barrier to their efforts and success,\u201d said state Sen. Nicole Fox, R-Lincoln, who introduced the measure.\n\nThe bill passed on a 42-0 vote, with six senators not voting. Ricketts has voiced support for the legislation, Fox said.\n\nLawmakers in Nebraska may have been keeping an eye on the ongoing fight in neighboring Iowa over the hair braiding issue. Iowa\u2019s licensing laws also require 2,100 hours of cosmetology training for hair braiders, but the state is facing a lawsuit over those requirements.\n\nREAD MORE: Hair braiders tangle with Iowa bureaucrats in lawsuit challenging excessive regulations\n\nAs Watchdog has reported, the two plaintiffs in that lawsuit are African-American women who have been prevented from starting businesses by the onerous licensing rules.\n\nOne of them, Achan Agit, came to the United States as a refugee from Sudan in 2004. Though she\u2019s been braiding hair in the African tradition since she was five years old, her lack of a high school diploma means she cannot be licensed to work in Iowa.\n\nThese types of licensing schemes are getting more attention in state legislatures this year, not just because of the threat of lawsuits.\n\nThe White House issued a report last year urging state and local governments to loosen licensing requirements and cut red tape to open employment opportunities. The report noted that the number of jobs requiring an occupational license has grown five-fold since the 1950s and argued that licensing schemes disproportionately affect the poor, who are probably less likely to spend time and money on licenses.\n\nIn Nebraska, it seems, state lawmakers were listening.", "description": "Hair braiding in Nebraska will no longer require a cosmetology .09/02/2019 3:15:57AM EST.", "authors": ["Eric Boehm", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/03/shutterstock_132261179-600x400.jpg"}
