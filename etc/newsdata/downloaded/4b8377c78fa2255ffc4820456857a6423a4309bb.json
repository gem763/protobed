Bloomberg\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 Wall Street ended a choppy week of trading with a broad rally that drove the Dow Jones Industrial Average more than 370 points higher.\n\nThe gains Friday also gave the S&P 500 index its best day in seven weeks, though the benchmark index still finished with its third straight weekly loss.\n\nTechnology, health care and financial stocks powered much of the rally, which was spurred by mixed job market data for September. The report showed that employers are still adding jobs at a healthy clip, albeit more slowly, and that the national unemployment rate dropped to a five-decade low.\n\nThe jobs report punctuated a rough week dominated by surprisingly weak numbers in surveys of manufacturing and service industries, which raised recession worries and sent the S&P 500 to its first back-to-back losses of 1% this year.\n\nKey financial deadlines this fall: FAFSA, Social Security among important events\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably some relief this morning that the labor report didn\u2019t confirm or enhance the weakness that we saw out of the two (economic) surveys,\u201d said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 41.38 points, or 1.4%, to 2,952.01. The index finished the week with a 0.3% loss.\n\nMonitors display the ebb and flow of money at the New York Stock Exchange.

The Nasdaq composite gained 110.21 points, also 1.4%, to 7,982.47. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks rose 14.36 points, or 1%, to 1,500.70.\n\nStock markets around the world rose and gold dipped following the release of the U.S. jobs data as investors felt less need for safety.\n\nThe Labor Department said employers added 136,000 jobs last month, slightly less than the 145,000 that economists were expecting and below the 168,000 pace from August. Worker\u2019s wages were also weaker than expected, with zero growth from a month before.\n\nOn the encouraging side, the government said hiring in prior months was stronger than earlier estimated, and the unemployment rate dropped to 3.5% from 3.7%.\n\n\u201cWhile the bears may take this as a further confirmation of a slower economy, it is actually a pretty strong read, especially when you factor in previous revisions\u201d said Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at ETrade Financial.\n\nIf the job market can remain strong, it would allow U.S. households to keep spending. And that spending strength has been the hero for the economy recently, propping it up when slowing growth abroad poses a threat and President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China saps exports and manufacturing.\n\nAnticipation built through the week for the jobs report as a parade of weak data on the economy shook markets around the world. Manufacturing contracted last month at its sharpest pace in a decade, and growth in the nation\u2019s services sector slowed.\n\nFriday\u2019s mixed report shows a jobs market that is slowing but still growing, and economists said it could signal that a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s meeting later this month is no longer a slam dunk. The central bank has already cut rates twice this year to shield the economy from the effects of slowing growth abroad and the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 1.53%. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations about what the Fed will do, rose to 1.40% from 1.37%.\n\nThe world\u2019s two largest economies are set to talk again next week about trade. Markets have been quick to swing on any hint of movement in their dispute, which has dragged on manufacturing around the world and pushed CEOs to delay investments given all the uncertainty.\n\n\u201cWhat market participants will be looking for is really what is the next trajectory?\u201d Northey said. \u201cIs it getting worse? Is it getting better? Is it status quo?\u201d\n\nThe odds of Washington and Beijing hammering out a substantive deal in the near term are very low, he added.\n\n\u201cAn agreement to continue to negotiate toward a mutually acceptable future endpoint is really what would be viewed as a success,\u201d Northey said.\n\nTechnology, health care, financial and communication services stocks accounted for much of the market\u2019s gains Friday. Visa rose 1.8%, UnitedHealth Group gained 2.1%, Citigroup added 2.2% and Google parent Alphabet picked up 1.8%.\n\nApple helped drive the market higher, rising 2.8%. A Japanese newspaper, Nikkei, said that the company asked suppliers to ramp up production of its iPhone 11. Moves in Apple\u2019s stock have an outsized effect on the S&P 500 because it\u2019s the second-largest constituent in the index by market size.\n\nHP slumped 9.6% after the maker of personal computers and printers announced jobs cuts of up to 16% of the company\u2019s payroll.\n\nCrude oil recovered from an early slide to close with a modest gain. Still, it ended the week with a loss of 5.3%, reflecting worries about weakening demand and growing supplies.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude rose 36 cents to settle at $52.81 per barrel. It started the week at $55.91. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 66 cents to close at $58.37 per barrel.\n\nWholesale gasoline rose 1 cent to $1.57 per gallon. Heating oil climbed 1 cent to $1.89 per gallon. Natural gas rose 2 cents to $2.35 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\nGold fell 90 cents to $1,506.20 per ounce, silver fell 5 cents to $17.54 per ounce and copper rose 1 cent to $2.56 per pound.\n\nThe dollar was unchanged at 106.87 Japanese yen from the yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.0984 from $1.0973.\n\nMajor European stock indexes finished higher.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/04/dow-stocks-rise-after-unemployment-rate-reaches-50-year-low/3864127002/", "description": "Stocks surged Friday after a report showed the U.S. jobs market is still growing enough for the unemployment rate to drop to a five-decade low.", "authors": ["The Associated Press", "Published A.M.
