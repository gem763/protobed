GILL HUDSON on life for those with the disease", "language": "en", "text": "Gill Hudson received a call from a neurologist about her friend Lucy, 66\n\nOctober 2018. I\u2019ve been up in London and am just heading to Paddington for the journey home to Berkshire when my mobile phone starts buzzing. The screen says: \u2018No Caller ID\u2019.\n\nI never answer calls like that. If the caller\u2019s genuine, they\u2019ll leave a message, otherwise it\u2019s either a wrong number or a scam. So I can\u2019t explain why on this occasion I do.\n\n\u2018Gill Hudson?\u2019 It\u2019s a man\u2019s voice: well-spoken, assured. I\u2019m wary. \u2018Yes?\u2019\n\nIt turns out he\u2019s a neurologist from one of the big London hospitals. \u2018I\u2019ve got your friend Lucy with me. She wants you to know about her diagnosis. We found some proteins consistent with neurodegenerative disease in her spinal fluid.\u2019 He thinks Lucy has dementia, even though, at 66, she is relatively young for such a diagnosis.\n\nDevastating enough, but there\u2019s an additional complication. Apart from a very elderly uncle living in Cornwall, Lucy has no one: no partner, no children, no other family at all. So she has named me as, effectively, her next of kin, even though I\u2019ve barely seen her this year.\n\nLucy and I had been great friends for more than two decades, but our friendship had been under strain for a couple of years, and, as far as I was concerned, was pretty much over.\n\nHer long-term anxiety issues had started to spiral out of control. She\u2019d phone me endlessly to obsess over the most mundane of issues (was she using the right recycling bin for cardboard; her terror at the prospect of an entirely routine eye check). I was having serious health issues myself at the time and was ground down by her constant neediness.\n\nThe last time I spoke to her, in May, I lost my temper and told her she really needed to see her doctor, as she was beginning to alienate even her oldest friends, including me. She promised she\u2019d book an appointment with her GP. This was the outcome.\n\nBeing diagnosed with dementia doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t live alone. The adult social services department of a council can identify where patients might benefit from help, for example with meals or housework (file image)\n\nAfter the neurologist\u2019s call, instead of going home, I took the Tube to her house. I found Lucy [not her real name] on the doorstep, rummaging endlessly through her bag trying to find her keys. She burst into tears when she saw me and clung desperately to my arm, agitated and disorientated, shockingly thin and pale. Her coat was only half on and dragging along the ground.\n\n\u2018Come on, let\u2019s get you inside,\u2019 I said. I found her keys easily \u2014 \u2018Look! Here they are!\u2019 \u2014 and opened the door.\n\nThe sight stopped me in my tracks. It was as though someone had trashed the place. Chairs were overturned. The landline phone was off the hook and trailing uselessly. The contents of her filing cabinets had been tipped out.\n\nThe fridge door lolled open, its paltry contents warm and rancid. The carpet was covered with coffee cups, unwashed plates, dirty underwear, old bills and used tissues and stank of sour milk.\n\nMost striking of all was the paper. It was everywhere \u2014 A4 photocopier paper, notelets, Post-it notes, sheets from notepads \u2014 all covered in tiny, barely legible, scribbles detailing names, phone numbers, shopping lists and random thoughts; the desperate scrawls of someone trying to hold on to reality by writing things down, only to lose track of what they\u2019ve done.\n\nDaily Mail campaign to end dementia care cost betrayal\n\nLucy\u2019s answerphone was blinking insistently. There were more than 40 messages, all unanswered, including several from her elderly uncle, increasingly agitated by the lack of response. \u2018I think you need to ring him,\u2019 I said. But, although Lucy agreed, she was gazing blankly at the phone, as though baffled by it. I dialled the number for her, then went into another room to give her some privacy.\n\nAs I left, I heard Lucy say: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry I haven\u2019t rung before. I\u2019ve been having such problems with my phones.\u2019\n\nLucy \u2014 a highly intelligent and articulate former deputy head \u2014 was on conversation autopilot. You\u2019d never have known there was a problem at all. She was obviously no longer capable of living on her own without help. I needed to talk to her GP. But who was she? Lucy couldn\u2019t think what her doctor\u2019s name was. All I knew was that she was local, so I started to ring around the surgeries.\n\nThere were 15 of them. And, frustratingly, if understandably, none of them could tell me whether she was a patient for reasons of confidentiality.\n\nI suddenly remembered that Lucy had told me her doctor had been to Canada last year. It was only by checking this detail each time I rang that I was eventually able to identify the likely surgery, even though they still couldn\u2019t confirm that Lucy was on their books.\n\nIt took weeks to get any kind of acceptable care in place. Social services arranged an emergency six-week support package, with two care visits a day, but the practical problems were interminable.\n\nWhile the carers could get supplies from the nearby supermarket, they weren\u2019t allowed to use Lucy\u2019s credit or debit cards, for obvious reasons.\n\nBut, in that case, where was the money going to come from?\n\nI ended up leaving an emergency \u00a340 in an envelope and then filled out a cheque to myself for Lucy to sign, uncomfortably aware of how easy it would be to defraud her.\n\nThere were only two cheque slips left. What to do when these ran out? How long could I afford to subsidise her? After my abortive attempts to communicate with her bank, social services eventually managed to explain the situation to them, but getting a new chequebook still took weeks.\n\nA customer services manager subsequently sent a handwritten notelet in the post, giving a number to call if Lucy needed help.\n\nBut, as Lucy was incapable even of reading it, let alone phoning, I rang and left a message, saying that while I understood the need for confidentiality, perhaps she could liaise with me via social services, or suggest another way through? I left a message three times. No reply.\n\nSocial services needed to know what Lucy\u2019s income and outgoings were so they could assess how much she\u2019d have to contribute towards care costs.\n\nI rummaged through her files, trying to find some clues. Were there outstanding bills? How did she pay for her gas, water and electricity? What other income did she receive apart from her state pension? I had absolutely no idea.\n\nI opened a bill from her mobile phone provider. Lucy had negotiated a very keen monthly tariff because she barely used her mobile, preferring the landline.\n\nBut, no longer able to dial, she\u2019d obviously been resorting to speed dial on her mobile and had gone hopelessly over the agreed limit.\n\nI checked the number of anxiety-driven calls she\u2019d made to me in the past week alone: 72. Her bills were now more than \u00a3300 a month, instead of \u00a37.39.\n\n\u2018What\u2019s her password?\u2019 asked the provider, refusing to discuss the issue without it. How could I know? Hospital letters for appointments continued to be sent to her and, every time I trekked up to town to see her, at least once or twice a week, I\u2019d have to crawl around the constantly replenished piles of paper, trying to locate any new letters that might need acting on.\n\nHere was one about an in-patient stay. Could she please ring immediately to confirm, otherwise they couldn\u2019t guarantee a bed? I rang on her behalf, but \u2014 guess what \u2014 they couldn\u2019t talk to me unless I knew her security word. In desperation, I emailed the surgery and asked for help. No reply.\n\nPurely by chance, I was present when social services sent round an \u2018assessor\u2019.\n\n\u2018Right, Lucy, I need to ask you some questions,\u2019 she began. She had boxes to tick on her forms.\n\nQuestion one: \u2018Can you make decisions?\u2019\n\nI was at even more of a loss to answer than Lucy. There was a long pause. \u2018Yeeeess?\u2019 said Lucy, uncertainly. Tick.\n\nQuestion two: \u2018What are your cultural and identity issues?\u2019\n\nExcuse me? We both sat in stunned silence. Lucy looked bewildered. \u2018I don\u2019t know?\u2019 she eventually offered. Tick (but which box?).\n\nQuestion three: \u2018What outcomes would you like from your support?\u2019\n\nI\u2019d had enough already. \u2018I\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019d like to achieve,\u2019 I said, tersely. \u2018The issue is that Lucy can barely walk, has no short-term memory, is not capable of even buying, let alone cooking, food, and can\u2019t dress or wash herself any more. Is that enough to be going on with?\u2019\n\nI was met with a blank look and a dutiful noting down of my comments. What if I hadn\u2019t happened to be there?\n\nThe process of getting a fuller diagnosis of the extent of Lucy\u2019s dementia and agreeing the best long-term care has been chaotic, gruelling and often overwhelming.\n\nThere have been endless hospital appointments: neurology, urology, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and more.\n\nI\u2019ve had countless conversations and meetings about safeguarding issues, who is paying for the care, the varying quality of that care, and the lack of continuity (six social workers so far).\n\nMost of these issues are still being resolved nearly a year later, although I have managed to arrange power of attorney through Lucy\u2019s solicitor.\n\nA Growing Crisis Around 120,000 people with dementia in the UK currently live on their own, and that number is expected to double to 240,000 by the year 2039, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Society. Patients living alone are less likely to receive a formal diagnosis of dementia \u2014 or are given a delayed diagnosis \u2014 compared with those living with others, say campaigners. This may be because they are in denial that they have a problem, or they forget their GP appointments. A delayed diagnosis means delayed access to medicines that might slow progression of the disease and support that would make life easier. Around 62 per cent of people with dementia who live alone feel lonely, compared with 38 per cent of all people with dementia, found a 2013 survey by the Alzheimer\u2019s Society. Studies have shown loneliness can lead to early death because it can damage the heart.\n\nWhen someone lives on their own, and without a family to call on, there is nobody to hold the different threads of their life together. It fell to me to stitch together some sort of support.\n\nIt\u2019s just as well I decided to keep detailed notes of dates and times from the start. Nobody else did.\n\nNo one seemed to notice Lucy\u2019s breath was foul and her toenails alarmingly long. I had wrongly assumed the carers would automatically attend to such basic personal hygiene.\n\nHer flat ended up plastered with Post-it notes from me saying: \u2018Please brush her teeth, please buy milk/bin bags/bananas, please wash these clothes. Please.\u2019\n\nOver the months, I managed to gather together a small, but trusty, band of old friends of Lucy\u2019s, for whose support I will be eternally grateful. Most of them, like me, had rather lost touch due to her increasingly alienating behaviour, but were ready to pitch in.\n\nWe set up a rota so Lucy would have at least one or two visits a week. Not nearly enough, but certainly better than nothing.\n\nWe all felt guilty that we had missed the point at which Lucy\u2019s \u2018funny little ways\u2019 had tipped over into full-blown dementia.\n\nHow long had we been fooled by her verbal fluency? Every time I tracked down another of her old friends, they\u2019d initially be baffled \u2014 \u2018But she seemed fine the last time I phoned her . . .\u2019 \u2014 before remembering the peculiarities of their last actual encounter with her. \u2018Ah yes, of course, that explains why . . .\u2019\n\nAll of us have been shocked by how hard it\u2019s been to tackle practical problems when so much of what we needed to know was hidden away on Lucy\u2019s computer.\n\nAt the very least, anyone living alone should compile an easily accessible list of key contacts (GP, solicitor . . .), basic financial information (\u2018A current account with x, a savings account with y and a pension from z. All outgoings paid by direct debit\u2019), and arrange power of attorney.\n\nGo on. Do it right now.\n\nIn May this year, Lucy finally went into a care home. After a number of falls and subsequent hospital admissions, all parties agreed she was no longer safe living on her own. I\u2019m not ashamed to admit the relief has been immense.\n\nBut Lucy\u2019s is by no means an isolated problem. A report in March 2019 from Ageing Well Without Children highlights that the number of over-65s without children will nearly double to two million by 2030.\n\nAs the number of people living with dementia is expected to rise to a million within the next couple of years, more people without children will have dementia, too.\n\nThis, combined with shrinking state resources, is a timebomb.\n\nDominic Carter, policy manager at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, recently said: \u2018The care system for those living with dementia is overly reliant on family care.\n\n\u2018If you don\u2019t have family to care for you, you\u2019re left to fend for yourself, which means risking becoming very unwell. We need a special care and health system that recognises this demographic.\u2019\n\nLucy is just one of that demographic. She so very nearly slipped through the net. I often wonder what would have happened if I hadn\u2019t answered that phone call.\n\nHow to help dementia patients who are on their own\n\nBeing diagnosed with dementia doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t live alone. The adult social services department of a council can identify where patients might benefit from help, for example with meals or housework.\n\nIf the patient\u2019s \u2018primary need\u2019 relates mainly to health, they might be eligible for NHS Continuing Healthcare (CHC) funding, covering the cost of care bills, at home or in a care home. Around 160,000 people a year receive this funding, and the majority are elderly with dementia, but it\u2019s a system mired in controversy. The definition of a \u2018health need\u2019 is vague, and interpretation of the eligibility criteria varies depending on the health authority (Clinical Commissioning Group, or CCG). A National Audit Office report in 2017 found the proportion of patients deemed eligible ranges from 41 to 86 per cent, depending on where you live.\n\nCharities usually suggest appointing a friend or family member to act as an advocate. For those totally alone, charities may be able to help. Admiral nurses \u2014 registered nurses who are experts in dementia, run by the charity Dementia UK \u2014 offer solutions to people with dementia living on their own.\n\nThe Alzheimer\u2019s Society has developed a network of more than 400 dementia-friendly communities, where residents are committed to improving the lives of people with dementia in their area, and runs an initiative called Side By Side, pairing volunteers with people living with dementia so they can carry on doing the things they enjoy.\n\nThere is also a growing range of products and services, such as movement sensors that can detect when someone has fallen, to help those with dementia live independently and safely.\n\nJeremy Hughes, the chief executive of the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, has warned too many people living alone with dementia don\u2019t get the support they need.\n\n\u2018Dementia should not mean becoming a prisoner in your own home,\u2019 he told Good Health. \u2018It shouldn\u2019t mean everyday activities, such as going to the shop, fill you with anxiety and dread.\u2019\n\nNational Dementia Helpline: 0300 222 1122.", "description": "GILL HUDSON: October 2018.
