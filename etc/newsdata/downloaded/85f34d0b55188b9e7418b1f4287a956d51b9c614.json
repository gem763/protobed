Experts told Business Insider that an unstable environment can contribute to thoughts of self-harm.\n\nTwo protesters who Business Insider spoke to for this article expressed similar feelings of despair and fear for their futures.\n\nTwo others, one teacher and one youth psychologist who both work closely with protesters, told Business Insider that they have encountered students who expressed distress over the current state of affairs in the city.\n\n\"We believe this is the last stand for our future and freedom,\" a 22-year-old protester told Business Insider. \"We'd rather die in the fight then slowly suffocate to death after we lose the fight.\"\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThey're dressed in an all-black uniform, faces distorted behind gas masks, using umbrellas as shields, and following a sophisticated set of hand motions which act as their form of communication.\n\nFor more than three months, millions of civilians have been protesting the Hong Kong government.\n\nProtesters stand off against riot police in a business district of Tsim Sha Tsui on August 10, 2019.

And for many young protesters, weekly demonstrations have become an increasingly more desperate, sometimes violent fight against what they see as a shrinking view of their future.\n\nUnlike the city's high concentration of super-wealthy, the youth of Hong Kong are struggling to afford to live in one of the world's most expensive cities. A recent economic shift hit \"educated, white-collar professionals\" particularly hard, The New York Times reported. \"Wages stalled or declined. What they made bought far less. Many became less well-off than their parents had been.\"\n\nThe average price of a home in Hong Kong in 2019 is $1.2 million. Graffiti near a protest site calls out the average rent for a small room in a shared apartment: \"7K for a house like a cell and you really think we out here scared of jail,\" referring to HK$7,000, or $893.\n\nAdditionally many feel uncertain about their future in the Chinese territory once the \"one country, two systems\" agreement ends in 2047.\n\nTo the protesters who spoke to Business Insider, the continued demonstrations are a matter of life and death.\n\n\"We believe this is the last stand for our future and freedom,\" Chan, 22, a recent college graduate and protester who requested we use only his last name, told Business Insider over the messaging app Telegram in early August. \"We'd rather die in the fight then slowly suffocate to death after we lose the fight.\"\n\nA protester makes a gesture during a protest on June 12, 2019 in Hong Kong China. Large crowds of protesters gathered in central Hong Kong as the city braced for another mass rally in a show of strength against the government over a divisive plan to allow extraditions to China. Anthony Kwan/Getty Images\n\nProtesters have 5 key demands\n\nProtest groups have put forward five key demands, which continue to fuel demonstrations and have become a rallying cry for many protesters:\n\nA full withdrawal of the extradition bill;\n\nRetraction of the characterization of protests as riots;\n\nThe release of protesters arrested by police unlawfully;\n\nEstablishing an independent inquiry into allegations of police brutality and excessive use of force against protesters;\n\nCarrie Lam's resignation and the introduction of fair and free elections in the city.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam scrapped the incendiary extradition bill on September 4 in a long-awaited concession, promising to formally withdraw the legislation without debate or voting in the next council, which is set to resume in October.\n\nStill, some pro-democracy activists have called the move \"too little and too late,\" and protests, particularly among students, have continued with no signs of slowing. Large-scale protests are also expected ahead of two anniversaries: the five year marker of the Umbrella Movement this weekend and the 70th anniversary of the formation of the People's Republic of China on Tuesday.\n\nViolence on the 'front lines'\n\nChan considers himself a \"frontline protester,\" someone stationed at the forefront of demonstrations directly facing off against riot police who are armed with tear gas, batons, rubber bullets, beanbag rounds, and even live ammunition.\n\n\"I believe almost all frontline protesters, including myself, are ready to be arrested or die in protests,\" Chan told Business Insider last month.\n\nA protester throws brick at the Tseung Kwan O Police Station on August 4, 2019. Anthony Kwan/Getty Images\n\nThough a portion of protests over the last 16 weeks have been peaceful and largely without incident, offshoot groups of protesters \u2014 growing more and more infuriated with government inaction and allegations of police brutality \u2014 have frequently clashed with police, throwing bricks, umbrellas, and other objects at law enforcement.\n\nHardline activists have been criticized by police for their violent tactics. In recent months, groups of protesters have stormed and ransacked the city's Legislative Building, surrounded the city's police headquarters, and occupied the city's airport for days, disrupting flights and causing tourism to plummet.\n\nPolice have ramped up their responses to protests in tandem, firing tear gas and rubber bullets at crowds, infiltrating protest groups using disguises and arresting people en masse. Protesters have also suggested that police have employed the use of organized gangs in order to carry out attacks on commuters.\n\nOn September 19, Amnesty International released results from a field investigation which revealed instances of severe beatings, arbitrary arrests, and threats of violence towards protesters at the hands of police.\n\nWhile peaceful activism has helped the movement spread their message to the mainstream, many protesters are wary that demonstrations alone will actually achieve results without disrupting the status quo.\n\nOrganizers say two million people joined protests on June 16, 2019.

After 79 days, the protests ended, but the movement's core goal \u2014 establishing true, universal suffrage \u2014 was never actualized. Nine pro-democracy campaigners were convicted for their leadership roles in the protests, with four handed jail sentences this past April.\n\n\"It's proven that violence, to some degree, will be useful,\" a 30-year-old protester told Reuters last month.\n\nProtesters hold placards and banners during the demonstration.

In that time, over 1,400 people have been arrested, according to Bloomberg, and at least 70 people have been charged with rioting, the South China Morning Post estimates, a criminal offense that carries a jail sentence of up to 10 years.\n\nProtesters are willing to die for freedom\n\nMourners hold candles during a candlelight vigil to commemorate a protester who died last night during a rally against a controversial extradition law proposal on June 16, 2019. Anthony Kwan/Getty Images\n\nA protester actively working on the frontlines who requested anonymity due to fears for her safety told Business Insider that protesters, including herself, see the current fight against Chinese influence as an \"end game,\" and she said she has engaged with protesters who have expressed a readiness to die in continued clashes.\n\n\"They say that if Hong Kong has no future, I have no future either,\" she told Business Insider. \"So I may as well fight or die for it.\"\n\nGraffiti and umbrellas are seen outside the main chamber of the Legislative Council during a media tour in Hong Kong on July 3, 2019, two days after protesters broke into the complex.

Some carry suicide notes or a last will and testament in their bags.\n\n\"They fight, they're very ready to die,\" she said.\n\nChan said he, too, always has a note addressing his family inside of his bag in case confrontations turn violent.\n\nIn July, masked assailants linked to organized crime gangs stormed the Yuen Long Metro Station in the city's north and attacked commuters returning from protests.\n\nA few weeks ago, a young female medic was hit in the eye by a bean bag round shot by police. Police denied the claims and said there was no evidence that officers had caused her injury.\n\nAn injured young female medic receives medical assistance after being hit by a pellet round in the right eye during a demonstration in Tsim Sha Tsui neighborhood, August 11, 2019.

We Hong Kong citizens are frightened, every frontline protester is frightened.\"\n\nFor Chan, the current climate is a win or lose scenario.\n\n\"This time is our last effort to fight for our democracy,\" he added. \"We have been shot, beaten, overwhelmed with tear gas. We are risking our life and future. We just wanted to enjoy democracy. We are prepared to die. Because Hong Kong is our home, our beloved home.\"\n\nExperts say protests have left people feeling hopeless and helpless\n\nProtests have not only consumed Hong Kong's physical space, but according to experts, they are taking a mental toll on protesters.\n\nAt least four protesters have died by apparent suicide in the last few months. Several suicide-prevention groups previously shared that they had received more calls since protests began, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\n\"This is a public mental health situation,\" Clarence Tsang, the executive director of suicide-prevention group Samaritan Befrienders, told the Post.\n\nProtesting appears to dominate the daily discourse for Hong Kong's youth. A teacher and a youth psychologist who both work closely with protesters told Business Insider last month that they have encountered students who expressed distress over the current state of affairs in the city.\n\nProtesters attempt to smash a glass door at the government headquarters in Hong Kong on July 1, 2019, on the 22nd anniversary of the city's handover from Britain to China. ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHenry Ng, a lecturer at Hong Kong University and expert in social psychology, told Business Insider that there has been a \"general sense of hopelessness and helplessness\" among protesters, many of whom are students or young adults. \"The two feelings may cause people to become numb to the situation,\" Ng said.\n\nHe added that in terms of cognitive development, young protesters, particularly teenagers, may be more susceptible to group influences and may be less developed in terms of inhibitory control. Ng says this may explain why the city's youth have been drawn to more violent means of protest.\n\nAnother lecturer at Hong Kong University, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution at work, told Business Insider in August that the general sentiment among protesters was that violence is \"inevitable\" because of lack of response by the government to more peaceful methods of protest.\n\nShe added that in her experience, many young protesters felt like they had \"nothing to lose\" and that \"blood is ready to be shed because there is no future ahead.\"\n\nProtesters hold banners and shout slogans as they march on a street on June 16, 2019. Anthony Kwan/Getty Images\n\nA youth psychologist who requested to be identified only by his last name, Ching, told Business Insider in August that a combination of feelings \u2014 fury over police use of force, confusion about the government's lack of response, distrust towards the Hong Kong legal system, and worry over Hong Kong's future \u2014 dominated the mindset of protesters that he had spoken to.\n\nChing recalled an incident in July during a memorial service for one of the protesters who died by suicide, in which he was on hand to give \"psychological first aid\" to those in attendance. He said as the evening wore on, he tended to a 14-year-old protester who expressed concern over retribution towards his family for his activity in protests, which progressed into suicidal ideation.\n\n\"Overwhelmed and feeling helpless, Hong Kongers are inexperienced in facing such large scale protests and desperation,\" he said. \"They are using different methods and ways to express their anger and frustration.\"\n\nNg said steps were being taken to address the mental well-being of young protesters, including the creation of task forces in local universities in order to address the psychological needs of their students.\n\nChing said those within his organization are conducting psychological first aid training and have set up public outreach services, like counseling, for teachers and students, as the city's youth have been most affected by protests.\n\nA protester covers her eyes with a China flag.

Earlier this week she held an \"open dialogue\" town hall, where 150 people in the movement shared their feelings about her leadership. Protesters then blockaded the stadium where the meeting was held.\n\nThough the extradition bill has been withdrawn, protesters are preparing for the long haul\n\nChing told Business Insider on September 11 that protesters will continue to turn out until their five demands are met \"and not one less.\"\n\n\"The withdrawal has only made a small difference on the movement from the protester's point of view,\" he said.\n\nSecondary school students wearing masks join a human chain protesting against what they say is police brutality against protesters, after clashes at Wan Chai district in Hong Kong, China September 9, 2019. REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh\n\nA protester actively working on the frontlines told Business Insider earlier this month that while protesters have begun to shift their focus onto the other key demands outlined, her mindset on protesting remains the same.\n\n\"I think our methods have changed a lot since August,\" she said. \"But I think one thing that really has shown itself to be more clear is that we do not separate from each other.\"\n\n\"Whether we are peaceful or whether we are on the frontlines, [our methods] are inseparable.\"\n\nShe said that although uncertainty lies ahead, the situation in the city for her remains a matter of life and death.\n\n\"The fight is definitely not over yet.\"", "description": "\"We'd rather die in the fight then slowly suffocate to death after we lose the fight,\" one protester told Business Insider.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8b28082e22af27ac557568?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
