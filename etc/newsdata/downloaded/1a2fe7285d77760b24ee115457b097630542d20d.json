They themselves are still in the line of succession to the Swedish throne.\n\nIt is believed this move by the king is to slim-down the royal family and better define the roles of the individual members.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nThe Deputy Marshal of the Realm, Fredrik Wers\u00e4ll, gave a press conference and said the whole royal family had been involved in the decision.\n\nDebate about the issue has been ongoing for several years and it's believed the desire was to provide a a better idea of the future roles of the children of the two younger children of the king.\n\nIn a statement from Fredrik Wers\u00e4ll, the royal house said: \"His Majesty The King has decided on changes to The Royal House. The purpose of these changes is to establish which members of The Royal Family may be expected to perform official duties incumbent on the Head of State or related to the function of the Head of State.\n\n\"His Majesty The King has decided that the children of Their Royal Highnesses Prince Carl Philip and Princess Sofia, and the children of Her Royal Highness Princess Madeleine and Mr Christopher O'Neill will no longer be members of The Royal House.\"\n\nAnd as if to confirm the news, the photo on the Royal Family page of the Swedish Royal Website has been changed from a group photo of all the children, wives and grandchildren, to one which just shows the King with the two heirs, Crown Princess Victoria and Princess Estelle.\n\nThe King of Sweden has three children - Crown Princess Victoria, Duchess of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland, who is the heir to the throne. Her daughter, Princess Estelle, is second in line to the throne while Prince Oscar is third in line.\n\nHis other children are Prince Carl Philip, Duke of V\u00e4rmland and Princess Madeleine, Duchess of H\u00e4lsingland and G\u00e4strikland.\n\nIt is his two younger children who have had their own children removed from the Royal House.\n\nRoyal Blogger Gert's Royals said: \"I don\u2019t think this is a result of any tension in the Royal Family. It\u2019s just about slimming down the monarchy (which is something we\u2019s seen throughout Europe in the last few generations) and allowing the children to lead quieter, private lives, without the burden of HRH.\"\n\nEarlier this year a Channel 5 documentary claimed the Prince of Wales wants to \"slim down\" the royal family .\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe Channel 5 show, The Royal Family at War, investigates the relationship between Prince Charles and Prince Andrew, stating that Charles is concerned about his brother \"ruining the Queen's legacy\".\n\nDuring the documentary, royal insiders said ongoing scandals, including his brother's relationship with a disgraced billionaire and his reputation for racking up huge travel bills, risked the family's public image.\n\nCharles is said to want a smaller monarchy when he eventually is crowned as king, with only his immediate family paid with taxpayers' cash.\n\nCNN royal commentator Victoria Arbiter said Prince Charles needs a \"slimmed down monarchy\" to remain relevant, as people are becoming frustrated by members of the family who are funded by the taxpayer \"but don't do an awful lot\".\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe full statement from the Swedish Royal House\n\nHis Majesty The King has decided on changes to The Royal House.
