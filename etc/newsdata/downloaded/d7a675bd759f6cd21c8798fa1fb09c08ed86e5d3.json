ACB, +2.07% ACB, +4.60% and Canopy Growth Corp. CGC, +1.57% WEED, +2.91% included a reference to the secret calculations in their most recent financial statements. The accounting tricks are necessary because both companies \u201cown\u201d U.S. companies that they must put a value on, even though they cannot legally own the businesses yet.\n\nBecause cannabis sales are prohibited under U.S. federal law, the Toronto Stock Exchange last year asked all Canadian pot companies listed on its exchange to divest their U.S. weed assets or risk losing their listings. Major cannabis producers such as Aurora and Canopy figured out ways to have U.S. holdings, though, including purchasing warrants and other options in U.S. businesses and spinning off arm\u2019s-length businesses that are able to invest in the U.S. because they are listed on junior exchanges, like Aurora\u2019s Australis Capital Inc. AUSA, +3.33% AUSAF, +3.29% .\n\nDetermining the value of those holdings is quite complicated, though. That\u2019s where a formula to determine when the cannabis companies will be able to recognize their investments in the U.S. market comes into play.\n\nAurora disclosed the use of the secret formula for the first time Wednesday in its disappointing fourth-quarter earnings report, when it revealed a new method of valuing warrants it holds to buy back a stake in one-time subsidiary Australis. Using the formula added almost C$10 million ($7.6 million) to Aurora\u2019s bottom line.\n\nPreviously, Aurora valued the cash costs of its warrants in Australis, a venture capital-type unit, at half a million dollars. The change \u201cadjusted for a probability factor of legalization of cannabis in the U.S. under federal and certain state laws\u201d resulted in a C$9.6 million gain, which flowed through the income statement and bolstered the company\u2019s net income. Aurora did not disclose the formula itself, only that it factored in the probability of legalization in the future.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Aurora Cannabis stock drops after earnings, as pot sales miss revised target\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really looking at ways where we can make, one, Australis more attractive to us, because we envision sometime in the near term that we\u2019re going to be able to access our back-end rights for Australis,\u201d Aurora executive chairman Michael Singer said in a phone interview Thursday.\n\n\u201c[T]wo, I think it really drives how we\u2019re looking at [merger and acquisition activity] vis-\u00e0-vis in the U.S. as a real near-term opportunity for us,\u201d Singer added. \u201cI wish I could tell you I knew more about how the regulations were going to change. I do believe they are and we\u2019re hopeful they\u2019re going to change relatively quickly and we want to be ready.\u201d\n\nSinger said that valuing the warrants with the new method was, in part, driven by the company\u2019s adherence to accounting rules.\n\n\u201cWe obviously report under [international financial reporting standards] and not U.S. [generally accepted accounting principals], so I think it\u2019s part of the year-end audit with KPMG.\u201d\n\nCanopy Growth, which also uses KPMG as an auditor after switching from Deloitte, also makes a secret calculation about the timing of U.S. legalization, according to its most recently available public financial statements. It uses the formula to adjust the value of Acreage Holdings Inc. ACRGF, +3.47%, which it bought the right to acquire in the future for $300 million, exchangeable shares of TerrAscend Corp. TER, +9.21% TRSSF, +8.70% and Slang Worldwide Inc. SLNG, +9.09% SLGWF, +9.05% warrants.\n\n\u201cWe report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards and external valuation specialists are engaged to assist management in determining the fair value of complex instruments,\u201d Jordan Sinclair, vice president of communications, wrote in an emailed statement.\n\nCanopy Growth also did not disclose the precise formula, nor when the company expects the U.S. to legalize marijuana, when it announced earnings last month.\n\nSee also: Canopy Growth\u2019s remaining CEO talks about pot company\u2019s shake-up, and the search for his replacement\n\nLegalization may not be the actual target for the formula, however. Canopy and Aurora have also recently adopted terminology that suggests they could attempt to enter the U.S. market for marijuana ahead of full legalization. In filings, the companies say they intend to be active in the U.S. market as soon as it is federally \u201cpermissible.\u201d\n\nThe change in language could be a nod to the STATES Act, which would allow states to make their own rules about cannabis. Though the act has received little attention from the current Congress despite a large push from weed-industry groups, if passed it would allow states such as California and Colorado to operate regulated cannabis regimes without the risk of federal reprisal.\n\nMultistate operators largely support such legislation, though it\u2019s unclear whether large-cap tobacco or food-and-beverage companies that have invested in the industry would also support the law, according to several well-placed people in the cannabis industry. Companies such Altria Group Inc. MO, -1.78% and Constellation Brands Inc. STZ, -1.72% may prefer to back legislation that legalizes pot and allows interstate commerce.\n\nRead: Cannabis industry\u2019s lobbying on track to hit a new record\n\nSinger told MarketWatch that the word \u201cpermissible\u201d isn\u2019t a perfectly defined term. \u201cIt\u2019s what we\u2019ve effectively negotiated with the [New York Stock Exchange] and TSX,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not certain about whether the [federal government] are going to make it legal, or whether they\u2019re going to make it permissible and then give the states the ability to sort of decide their own regulations \u2014 we think that may be enough,\u201d he said. \u201cBut again, we\u2019re still at the mercy of having those discussions with the regulator, though we\u2019ve been able to define permissibility as the right sort of threshold for us to engage in those discussions.\u201d\n\nIn a Thursday morning conference call, Chief Executive Terry Booth said that he spends about 90% of his time on opportunities for mergers and acquisitions, adding that the passage of the farm bill has created a significant opportunity for cannabis companies interested in pursuing products with cannabidiol, or CBD, derived from hemp.\n\nBooth said there were \u201ca couple of hurdles\u201d with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration related to products people ingest, but that the company has a \u201cgood idea of how its going to go.\u201d\n\nU.S.-traded shares of Aurora fell 9.2% in Thursday trading to close at $5.89, as Canopy stock dropped 3.2% to $26.53. The Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index HMMJ, +2.25% fell 2.5% during regular trading Thursday, while the benchmark S&P 500 index SPX, -1.83% rose 0.3%.", "description": "The two largest pot companies in the world have developed secret formulas that predicts U.S. federal and state cannabis legalization.", "authors": ["Max A.
