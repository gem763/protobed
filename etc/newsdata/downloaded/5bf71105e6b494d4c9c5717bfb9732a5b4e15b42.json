In the most recent of a stream of grievances aired anonymously over past years, whistle-blowers accused Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh of instigating employees to inflate profits, mis-represent the lucrativeness of deals, even of abusing travel privileges. In a memo reproduced in local newspapers, Parekh\u2019s accusers offered emails and recordings to back up their claims.\n\nLittle evidence of wrong-doing has emerged publicly so far. Infosys pledged a full investigation Tuesday, while Parekh himself has remained silent. Yet investors blind-sided by the sheer volume of the charges wiped more than $7 billion off the company\u2019s market value in a single day. They may still be smarting from 2017, when internal upheaval eventually sparked an ouster of the popular Vishal Sikka, paving the way for Parekh\u2019s ascension and a board reshuffle.\n\n\u201cThe allegations appear serious and reputation is such a fragile thing,\u201d said Harish Bijoor, a Bangalore-based brand consultant. \u201cIt is very unfortunate but this type of thing besmirches a company\u2019s reputation in the eyes of employees, investors and clients.\u201d\n\nRead more: Infosys Dives Most in 6 Years as Whistle-Blowers Target CEO\n\nThe events unfolding in Infosys\u2019s home-town of Bangalore, the nation\u2019s tech capital, bear a resemblance to those of 2017 that brought down the tech giant\u2019s leadership. Two summers ago, a similar whistle-blower complaint alleged irregularities in a $200 million acquisition, setting off a chain of events that culminated in a vicious face-off with co-founder Narayana Murthy and Sikka\u2019s removal. The accusations against him were never proven.\n\nSikka and Parekh, a former Capgemini SE executive, were the first outside professionals brought in to run the 38-year-old company, after several decades of co-founders taking turns to occupy the CEO\u2019s office. Infosys\u2019s shares have gained 50% since Parekh took the helm in January 2018, versus roughly 20% over Sikka\u2019s three-year term. And the company\u2019s revenue grew about 25% during both their tenures.\n\nYet the number of whistle-blower complaints spiked during Sikka\u2019s and Parekh\u2019s reigns, covering a plethora of topics. None spooked markets quite as much as the latest missive published in the Deccan Herald on Monday. The company is now taking the right steps, auditing the whistle-blowers\u2019 letters and appointing a third-party investigator, said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief executive officer of Singapore-based Greyhound Research.\n\n\u201cThe CEO has a difficult task at hand coming after the sudden exit of his predecessor, managing founder and investor expectations and operating in a difficult business environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world over, companies take a ton of short cuts to look good in front of investors and analysts.\u201d\n\nInfosys May Need Some Private Time to Fix Itself: Andy Mukherjee\n\nThe brewing crisis around Infosys is far from the only one to hit corporate India of late. State-run lender Punjab National Bank disclosed fraud, for instance, part of a series of scandals to hit the financial industry.\n\nInfosys itself can ill-afford the distraction. It\u2019s grappling with fundamental changes in the software outsourcing industry, where younger rivals are snatching away contracts with newer technologies, and clients are moving away from the paid-by-the-hour outsourcing work that Infosys and rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. specialized in.\n\nAt Infosys, revenue growth slowed to single-digit percentages, while operating margins shrank. That marked the end of an era when its co-founders delivered stellar performances quarter after quarter, endearing the stock to investors. Fresh-out-of-college engineers compared a job offer from Infosys to winning the lottery.\n\nThis month, Infosys posted a 2% fall in quarterly profit after nervous clients held off on spending and growth in traditional service contracts stalled. That underscored the challenge for Parekh, who has pledged to drive growth.\n\nBoth he and Sikka have stressed investments in innovation, digital services and re-training employees in latest technologies such as automation and artificial intelligence. \u201cTo build the future Infosys, we have to make those investments now,\u201d Parekh, who has a reputation for being calm and understated, told Bloomberg in an interview last year.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The dust had barely settled at Infosys Ltd. when Asia\u2019s No. 2 software services firm once more found itself grappling with a potential leadership crisis.For the second time in about as many years, the Indian icon synonymous with the country\u2019s technological ascendancy is being forced to", "authors": ["Saritha Rai"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/09AusWXS4XK1IRvGo073xg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/21ba5ab08383181a365785bcf30d64f2", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
