(Image: Fox)\n\nBart Simpson has done some shitty things in his long, ageless life, but this one might take the cake. In an upcoming episode of The Simpsons, Bart is mistaken for a terminally ill child and gets to see a highly anticipated movie early. Instead of being honest about it though, he decides to use the spoilers for blackmail.\n\nAccording to TV Line, the episode, called \u201cBart and the Bad Guy,\u201d airs February 24. And since the whole premise is an obvious wink at Disney mega-blockbusters, it\u2019ll feature the voices of Marvel Chief Creative Officer Kevin Feige as well as Avengers: Endgame directors Joe and Anthony Russo.\n\nThe Russos voice executives furious with Bart for his lies and Feige voices \u201cChinnos,\u201d the \u201cevil alien supervillain\u201d from the film franchise in question, called Vindicator. (Uh... guess nobody involved has ever watched Rick and Morty?)\n\nThis is a picture of \u201cChinnos,\u201d a mash-up of Thanos and \u201cChin\u201d since he has such a weird one.\n\nChinnos, as voiced by Kevin Feige. (Image: Fox, TV Line)\n\nIs Chinnos holding a golden ticket or some kind of space iPhone? Find out in February!\n\nI first read this news as \u201cBart lies about being terminally ill,\u201d and I was like, \u201cMan, fuck you Bart.\u201d But, reading it again, it seems like he\u2019s just mistaken for someone who is sick and lies about it to see the movie. (Which is still shitty, but not quite \u201cFuck you, Bart\u201d shitty.) I\u2019m very curious how this all plays out, because minus the sick part, weaponised spoilers are becoming a problem in popular culture. Who can forget those lovely days when Endgame opened and people created Twitter accounts to just send spoilers to random people who tweeted about going to see the movie?\n\nAnyway, The Simpsons version of this comes next year.", "description": "Bart Simpson has done some shitty things in his long, ageless life, but this one might take the cake.
