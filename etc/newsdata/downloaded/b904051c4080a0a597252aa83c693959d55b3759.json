(AP) - Injured New York Yankees center fielder Aaron Hicks feels like he\u2019s ready to return to the roster for the AL Championship Series.\n\nHicks, who has a right elbow flexor strain and last played on Aug. 3, is among a group of players at the Yankees\u2019 complex in Tampa who were not on the AL Division Series roster.\n\nHick said Tuesday he is \u201cdefinitely ready to go out there and play.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor sure,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cThat\u2019s really what I\u2019m getting ready for is to get back and play in the playoffs. Get back to playing baseball.\u201d\n\nNew York, which completed a three-game sweep of Minnesota on Monday night, will face either Houston or Tampa Bay in Game 1 of ALCS on Saturday night.\n\nHicks is facing live pitching and throwing to bases.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty much doing everything,\u201d Hicks said.\n\nHicks watched the Yankees\u2019 series-clinching win with Rays catcher Travis d\u2019Arnuad and his family at a restaurant in St. Petersburg.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the second time that they celebrated without me, so it\u2019s one of those things that you just want to be part of it,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cIt is tough.\u201d\n\nOthers working out include outfielder Clint Frazier, first baseman Mike Ford, and pitchers Jordan Montgomery and Stephan Tarpley.\n\n\u201cI think all of us are ready to help if called upon,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a situation that you\u2019d rather be there, but if we\u2019re called upon I think anyone of us is ready to go up there and contribute.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique situation, especially because it\u2019s hard to break into the big leagues as it is,\u201d Frazier added. \u201cSo, I think it\u2019s one of those things when you finally do break in, it\u2019s one of the best feelings that you can have. I\u2019ve had that feeling for a little bit this year, and I\u2019m searching for that feeling again. All I can do is continue to wait.\u201d\n\nThird baseman Miguel And\u00fajar and first baseman Greg Bird, both out for the season with injuries, are also at the complex.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Injured New York Yankees center fielder Aaron Hicks feels like he's ready to return to the roster for the AL Championship Series.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Didtler"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
