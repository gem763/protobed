However, reports have suggested some screen protectors are incompatible with the reader because they leave a small air gap that interferes with the scanning.\n\nSamsung has said it is \"aware of the case of S10's malfunctioning fingerprint recognition and will soon issue a software patch\".\n\nBanks understand a fix will be rolled out this week, but on Thursday the South Korean firm was unable to confirm when that might happen.", "description": "Users have found a glitch that lets anyone unlock the device via its fingerprint authentication system.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9A08/production/_105723493_b152bfde-e98e-420d-8ebf-106e6ad09a12.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
