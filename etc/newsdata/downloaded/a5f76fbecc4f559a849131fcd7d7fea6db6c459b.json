McGahn's name appeared 529 times in the 448-page report on the special counsel's investigation.\n\nMueller ultimately concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to show the Trump campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. And though Mueller declined to make a conclusion on whether the president committed obstruction of justice, he also did not exonerate Trump and outlined 11 instances of potential obstruction.\n\nIn short, though the conclusions the special counsel offered are complicated, Mueller did not explicitly accuse Trump of a crime.\n\nAlong these lines, Barr in the April phone call asked Trump why Giuliani was on TV attacking McGahn and drawing attention to himself instead of declaring victory and moving on from the Mueller probe, according to The Journal.\n\nRead more: 'Pure insanity': Intelligence veterans are floored by Barr's 'off the books' overtures to foreign officials about the Russia probe\n\nMore recently, Barr has reportedly expressed dismay over Trump lumping him in with Giuliani during a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the center of a whistleblower complaint that's sparked an impeachment inquiry in Congress. In the call, Trump urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and said he'd connect his Ukrainian counterpart with Barr and Giuliani.\n\nBarr is explicitly mentioned in the whistleblower complaint, but not nearly as many times as Giuliani.\n\nThe blurred lines between Barr and Giuliani's roles have continued to foster scrutiny from the president's critics.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi last Friday accused Barr of being part of a \"cover-up of the coverup\" and \"going rogue\" in relation to the Justice Department's role in urging the acting director of national intelligence against releasing the whistleblower complaint to Congress. The extent of Barr's involvement is an open question, but there's currently no evidence he played a direct role.\n\nBarr is also facing criticism from congressional Democrats, intelligence veterans, and legal experts over a Washington Post report that says he urged foreign officials to cooperate in the Justice Department's probe into the origins of the Russia investigation. The attorney general also reportedly urged Trump to ask the prime minister of Australia to aide in the Justice Department's inquiry.", "description": "William Barr has been widely accused of behaving more like Trump's personal lawyer than the attorney general.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d93a4032e22af65560c0547?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
