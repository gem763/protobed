(AP) - Louisville started piling up points early behind its quick-strike special teams and big-play receivers. Wake Forest\u2019s league-best offense joined in with a late flurry.\n\nIt added up to one of the highest-scoring games in Atlantic Coast Conference history - and a signature victory for the Cardinals\u2019 new coach.\n\nLouisville held off No. 19 Wake Forest\u2019s late rally to upset the Demon Deacons 62-59 on Saturday night in the second-highest-scoring game in ACC history.\n\nThe combined 121 points was second only to the 137 scored in Pittsburgh\u2019s 76-61 victory over Syracuse in 2016. The teams combined for 1,188 total yards in this one.\n\n\u201cAll praise to the offense. They came out and just did everything they needed to do,\u201d Louisville nose tackle G.G. Robinson said. \u201cWe won. It\u2019s still tough to look at 600 yards of offense we gave up. But a win is a win so it is a big win over a big-time opponent and we can definitely see why they\u2019re the No. 1 offense in the ACC.\u201d\n\nFreshman quarterback Evan Conley ran 41 yards for a critical touchdown with 2:15 remaining after throwing two touchdown passes to Dez Fitzpatrick, and Hassan Hall returned a kickoff 100 yards for a score to help the Cardinals (4-2, 2-1) spoil Wake Forest\u2019s first national ranking in 11 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to help us to know that we can fight and compete with anybody out there,\u201d first-year coach Scott Satterfield said.\n\nWake Forest (5-1, 1-1) trailed 52-31 with less than 6\u00bd minutes remaining before rallying, with backup Sam Hartman - the starter for most of 2018 - throwing two touchdown passes in 35 seconds. He hit Scotty Washington from 22 yards before his 21-yarder with 3:37 left to Jack Freudenthal - who recovered the onside kick that set up his scoring catch.\n\nConley took a fourth-and-1 keeper 41 yards for a touchdown to give the Cardinals a 62-52 lead with 2:52 remaining - but that left plenty of time for the Demon Deacons to counter, with Hartman leading them 92 yards in seven plays and scoring on a 1-yard keeper with 1:10 remaining.\n\nThe onside kick squirted downfield, Tutu Atwell came away with it in a pileup with 1:05 left and the Cardinals ran out the clock to seal their first big victory under Satterfield.\n\n\u201cWe can talk all we want about the last play, but the bottom line is that if we show up ready to play today, it never comes down to that,\u201d said Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson, whose team fell behind 28-7 one play into the second quarter.\n\n\u201cWe just showed up and laid a dud in the first quarter,\u201d he added.\n\nMicale Cunningham threw a 55-yard touchdown pass to Seth Dawkins and a 9-yarder to Atwell before leaving in the second quarter with an injury. Conley took over and finished 12 of 18 for 196 yards with touchdowns of 15 and 50 yards to Dez Fitzpatrick.\n\n\u201cEvery time they needed a play,\u201d Clawson said, \u201cthey got it.\u201d\n\nJamie Newman threw three touchdown passes to Sage Surratt - covering 12, 3 and 47 yards - and finished 24 of 41 for 251 yards, but was intercepted twice.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nLouisville: The Cardinals took yet another huge step toward putting the misery of their 2-10 finish in 2018 behind them. They earned their first victory over a Top 25 opponent since their Lamar Jackson-led 63-20 rout of then-No. 2 Florida State in 2016, and their first against a ranked team on the road since Charlie Strong and Teddy Bridgewater won at No. 24 West Virginia in 2011.\n\nWake Forest: So much for the possibility of two unbeatens facing off in Death Valley when Wake Forest visits No. 1 Clemson on Nov. 16. The Demon Deacons\u2019 first appearance in the Top 25 since 2008 figures to be undone by a series of mistakes and an inability to keep up with the speedy Cardinals. Their seven-game winning streak - which dated to last season and matched the 1944 team\u2019s as the longest in school history - also is history.\n\nHAPPY RETURNS\n\nThat big yardage total doesn\u2019t include the three big field-flipping returns by the Cardinals. In addition to Hall\u2019s big return, he also brought the second-half kickoff 83 yards to the Wake Forest 15 to set up Conley\u2019s first touchdown pass. And Atwell had a 50-yard punt return. Wake Forest\u2019s coverage team struggled so badly that they opted for short, high kickoffs. \u201cOur special teams were atrocious tonight,\u201d Clawson said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even trust ourselves to cover it.\u201d\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nIt certainly seems like Wake Forest will drop a few spots - if not all the way out of the poll - but this result also might benefit Satterfield\u2019s old school: Appalachian State (5-0), which was three spots back of the Top 25 last week. Satterfield was a quarterback for the Mountaineers in the 1990s and spent six years as their head coach before taking the Louisville job before this season. \u201cMore importantly, it\u2019s helping our team,\u201d Satterfield said. \u201cBut anything to help the Mountaineers as well.\u201d\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nCunningham was hurt after he took off toward the left sideline early in the second quarter. Nasir Greer hit him low, causing the quarterback to do a complete head-over-feet flip and lose the ball, with Traveon Redd scooping it up and returning it to the Louisville 4. Cunningham briefly entered the team\u2019s sideline medical tent, then quickly returned to throw on the sideline but never got back in the game because Satterfield said he wasn\u2019t 100% healthy.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLouisville: Plays host to No. 1 Clemson on Saturday.\n\nWake Forest: Plays host to Florida State on Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Louisville started piling up points early behind its quick-strike special teams and big-play receivers.
