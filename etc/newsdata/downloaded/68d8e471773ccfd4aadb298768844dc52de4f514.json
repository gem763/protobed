Demers then shared the information with other top Justice Department officials and discussed next steps.\n\nAccording to the source, Attorney General Bill Barr was not involved in the conversations or informed on the matter at that point. It is unclear when Barr was briefed on the matter, but at least one senior Justice Department official was made aware of the call and concerns surrounding it that day.\n\nThe official whistleblower complaint regarding that call had already been transmitted to the intelligence community inspector general at that point. The IG has reported receiving that information on Aug. 12.\n\nBut the DOJ apparently learned of the concerns days before the complaint was formally turned over by the IG. The inspector general relayed the complaint to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Aug. 26, who then referred the matter to the Justice Department for review of executive privilege in the contents of the phone call.\n\nMaguire testified on his handling of the matter on Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee, defending his actions and citing the \u201cunprecedented\u201d nature of the matter.\n\nThe timeline of when the Justice Department first learned of the call was first reported by CNN on Thursday. The names of the officials involved in those initial discussions were not known until now.\n\nThe phone call is now at the heart of Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry into the president, announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week.\n\nINTEL CHIEF DEFENDS HANDLING OF TRUMP CALL COMPLAINT, SPARS WITH SCHIFF IN TENSE HEARING\n\nThe White House released an unclassified version of the transcript of the phone call on Wednesday. The memo, which does not reflect a \u201cverbatim transcript\u201d but is based on notes and recollections of those memorializing the call, shows Trump congratulating Zelensky on his election victory before Trump eventually gets to the subject of the Bidens, seeking an investigation of some kind.\n\nTrump first asked Zelensky to do a \u201cfavor\u201d and \u201cfind out what happened\u201d with the hacking of the Democratic National Committee server in 2016. He referenced CrowdStrike, a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks.\n\nThen, Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens.\n\n\u201cThe other thing, there\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that [Joe] Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it\u2026It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nThis refers to Joe Biden, while vice president, urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokrin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden allies maintain that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint, which was declassified by the Trump administration and released by the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, alleged that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, and claimed that Trump was soliciting foreign assistance to intervene in the 2020 presidential election. The whistleblower acknowledged in the complaint, though, that this was based on second-hand information.\n\nWhile the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to \u201clook into\u201d the Bidens, Trump allies note that it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid\u2014which had been frozen days earlier. Biden is vying for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nOn the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City on Wednesday, Trump met with Zelensky, who was asked by reporters about whether he felt pressured by Trump on the phone call this summer.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI think you read everything. I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t want to be involved in democratic elections of the U.S.A.,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cWe had a good phone call. It was normal, we spoke about many things.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cNobody pushed me.\u201d", "description": "The Justice Department first learned about the controversial call between President Trump and the Ukrainian president in mid-August after being informed by a top CIA official of internal concerns, Fox News has confirmed.", "authors": ["Jake Gibson", "Jake Gibson Is A Producer Working At The Fox News Washington Bureau Who Covers Politics", "Law Enforcement", "Intelligence Issues."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/27/694940094001_6089977836001_6089965176001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
