I was hooked.\n\n'I just went to seminars and workshops and got it all going.'\n\nAfter scrimping and saving throughout high school she was able to purchase her first home right out of school.\n\nShe didn't have enough money for a deposit in Sydney so she bought an apartment in Canberra for $70,000.\n\nAn inheritance of $12,000 helped secure the deal. And in just 18 months she was able to purchase her second home.\n\nDuring this time Ms Tower made the decision to study business at the University of Sydney, despite having no desire of having a career in the industry.\n\nSpeaking to Daily Mail Australia, she admits she was quite lost when she was young.

So that's where it stemmed from to start a tutoring business.\n\n'I fell in love with business so there was no way I was going back into the classroom.'\n\nShe was 20 years old and running a successful toy store and tutoring centre.\n\nFour years later, when the business was flourishing, Ms Tower fell pregnant with her first child and she was forced to reassess how her time was structured.\n\nShe decided to branch out and start licencing her own programs and curriculum as Begin Bright, which she eventually turned into a franchise.\n\nMs Tower credits her success to her childhood - which she admits was far from ideal but taught her a lot\n\nShe now wants to inspire other women and has written a book called One Life - How To Have The Life of Your Dreams\n\nWhen she finally sold the company in 2016 there were 33 tutoring centres across Australia - a remarkable feat for someone who had been told business wasn't for them.\n\nShe then decided to take a year off and travelled around the world, visiting 28 countries, with her husband and two boys.\n\nShe says her childhood taught her amazing resilience and problem solving, which helped with her success.\n\n'When things come up now with serious adulating it's not a big deal for me because I've had a lot of practice dealing with that. When you have been down really low you learn that you're going to be okay.\n\n'I know especially in my 20s I was willing to try anything because I knew that if I failed I'd be back to where I started, which wasn't a bad place to be.'\n\nShe now wants to inspire other women and has written a book called One Life - How To Have The Life of Your Dreams.\n\nHer advice to any budding entrepreneurs is to give it a go and don't be afraid to fail.\n\n'I always think my biggest metric for success is joy, sometimes we can be stuck in a life that looks good on the outside but leaves us feeling hollow.
