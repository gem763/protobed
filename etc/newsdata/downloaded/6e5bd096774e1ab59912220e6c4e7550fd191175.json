Not just the landmarks, the kids and the tacos we ordered from a San Antonio food truck. I shoot my car, my hotel room, even my vacation rental. When I arrive, I reflexively capture an image with my Pixel smartphone.\n\nExcept on a recent trip to Houston. After two exhausting days of driving, I collapsed in the bed of my VRBO vacation rental. I didn\u2019t notice the scratch marks on the kitchen counter and table until a day later.\n\nIt looked as if the previous tenant had sliced food on the counter without a cutting board. I saw the same patterns on the kitchen table. Had my teenagers done it? No, they assured me.\n\nThen I realized that, as only the second tenants in what had been advertised as a \u201cbrand new\u201d vacation rental, we might have to pay for new counters and a new kitchen table.\n\nMy fears are justified. I receive regular complaints from readers who have had to cover damages to rental cars or property. A photo would have exonerated them \u2014 if they\u2019d just remembered to take one. But what, exactly, should you photograph, and when should you take the picture?\n\nIf you\u2019re renting a car, you need \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d images. Why? The car rental company holds you responsible for the vehicle, even if someone else puts a scrape, ding or dent in it.\n\nWhat if you bought the car rental company\u2019s pricey insurance? Yes, even then. I\u2019ve received numerous complaints from drivers who thought they were insured but weren\u2019t.\n\nKimberly DeCarrera, a tax attorney from Atlanta and a frequent traveler, says she always shoots a video of her rental car. \u201cI walk around the entire vehicle, pointing out on the video any marks, scratches, dings or other damage. I then video the inside of the car,\u201d she says.\n\nA video of a rental vehicle saved her from a damage claim recently.\n\n\u201cThere was damage near the bottom of the car, so I didn\u2019t notice it when I rented the car,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut, of course, they noticed it when I returned the car and said that it was my fault. I brought out my cellphone and reviewed the video. It was there. Since it was date- and time-stamped, it saved me from having to pay the additional fees for the damage or the deductible on the insurance.\u201d\n\nTake a post-rental picture, too. Car rental companies often discover damage long after you\u2019ve returned the vehicle. The damage might not be your fault; a careless employee or another renter could have caused it. Having the \u201cafter\u201d images would exonerate you.\n\nKatherine Ziegler, a retired nurse from St. Louis, says she holds up the line when she returns her rental cars. She finds a car rental employee and asks for an in-person inspection.\n\n\u201cThen I request that the attendant write \u2018no damage\u2019 on the contract before leaving the return site. I have had cars with some damage as well as a smoke smell. I find someone from the company to verify that \u2014 and it\u2019s not always easy \u2014 before leaving and always get it in writing.\u201d\n\nThe same dynamic applies to hotel rooms.\n\n\u201cWhen in doubt, take a picture,\u201d says Shylar Bredewold, who owns Odyssean Travel, an online travel agency. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to slip on a wet floor because the shower has a crack or to face electrocution because an outlet is damaged,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take much to get a new unit or to move to another room. If in doubt, take a picture.\u201d\n\nThe biggest hotel \u201cgotchas\u201d are cleaning charges, particularly those related to smoking. Taking a quick photo of your room when you check out can save a $250 fee, usually assessed after you\u2019ve left the hotel, for removing the odor from your accommodations.\n\nHow so? Well, when you see a cleaning fee on your credit card after checkout and ask for evidence, hotels often send a picture of a cup or ashtray filled with ashes. Your checkout photo can prove that it wasn\u2019t taken in your room, and potentially get you off the hook for the fee.\n\nWhen it comes to vacation rentals, owners appear to be getting much stricter about charging guests for damage, and vacation rental platforms often side with the owners. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that. No one should trash a vacation rental or a hotel room \u2014 or a rental car, for that matter. But charging the wrong person for the damage is also wrong.\n\nI\u2019ve heard from many readers who had to eat a security deposit because an owner believed they\u2019d damaged an apartment or house. One of the worst accounts came from Courtney Kerschner, a teacher from Reading, Pa., who had rented a house in Rehoboth Beach, Del. She cleaned the house after her week there, but the owner pocketed the deposit because of \u201csmelly trash.\u201d\n\nKerschner says she\u2019d taken the trash to the curb. Unfortunately, she had no way to prove it. After one of my advocates contacted VRBO on her behalf, it refunded her $500 deposit as a courtesy.\n\nSo you can probably understand why I was nervous about the kitchen in my Houston vacation rental. I imagined losing the deposit or having to pay extra for something we didn\u2019t do. I sent a note to the owner, thanking her for her hospitality and casually mentioning the damaged countertops. To my relief, she quickly answered, \u201cWe\u2019re aware of it.\u201d\n\nNext time, I\u2019ll take a picture.", "description": "A photo or video can be worth a lot when contesting charges for damage to a rental car or lodgings.", "authors": ["Christopher Elliott", "Elliott Is A Consumer Advocate", "Journalist", "Co-Founder Of The Advocacy Group Travelers United.
