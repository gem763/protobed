Pelosi has clashed repeatedly with the judiciary chair in recent weeks and, according to several sources, has lost confidence in him and prefers to have House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff be the public face for making the case against Trump.\n\n\u201cA shift to Schiff is one of the options,\u201d a Democratic source told Yahoo News.\n\nMultiple party leadership aides on Capitol Hill told Yahoo News on Tuesday that a future inquiry could be moved out of the House Judiciary Committee and into another jurisdiction, including that of a select committee created by Pelosi\u2019s office.\n\nThat would signify a marked escalation in Democrats\u2019 pursuit of Trump while at the same time be seen as a slap at Nadler and Judiciary Committee members.\n\n\u201cThis idea has been raised by some members. We understand some members may endorse this publicly. The caucus will make these decisions,\u201d a senior Democratic aide said on condition he not be identified.\n\nThe Democratic source who discussed the possibility of Schiff leading impeachment proceedings said Pelosi is \u201cupset\u201d with how Nadler has handled the hearings especially after last week\u2019s testimony by Corey Lewandowski \u2014 a session that was widely panned as a disaster for the Democrats when the former Trump campaign manager repeatedly refused to answer the panel\u2019s questions.\n\nAlex Wong via Getty Images WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 17: Committee ranking member Rep.

Complete embarrassment.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Nadler did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Schiff declined to comment.\n\nBut some judiciary committee members argue that letting Schiff handle the impeachment case has its own problems: His committee is bound by strict confidentiality rules, forcing any documents or information it receives from the intelligence community to be kept behind closed doors.\n\nMoreover, setting up a new select panel could only further delay any House impeachment vote, resulting in the Democrats squandering a rare opportunity to strike against Trump when he is potentially vulnerable-and infuriating judiciary committee members who have been working on impeachment for months. Another way for Pelosi to reward her allegiance to Schiff, one member said, is to give him assurances he will be one of the impeachment managers for any trial in the Senate.\n\nSuch considerations were a sign that Pelosi has come to recognize that impatience with the investigations into Trump thus far has become untenable. Particularly, there was widespread frustration among Democrats with Nadler\u2019s handling of a hearing involving President Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski last week. In that hearing, Lewandowski repeatedly refused to answer questions and assumed a haughty, insulting posture towards Democrats. Two other key witnesses who had been given subpoenas simply did not show up.\n\nIt is far from certain, however, that Pelosi will activate a more aggressive investigatory agenda. While the Democratic source who discussed the structure of a potential inquiry said that Pelosi is likely to escalate matters this week, they were not sure whether that would include launching formal impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cNot sure how far she\u2019ll go,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe growing calls for impeachment follow last week\u2019s revelation that a whistleblower filed a complaint alleging President Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who has had business dealings in Ukraine. Joe Biden is a contender for the Democratic nomination for president, making any such investigation a charged political affair.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS U.S. President Donald Trump addresses reporters as he arrives with first lady Melania Trump for the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly, at U.N. headquarters, Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2019. (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle)\n\nTrump has admitted to talking about Biden to Zelensky, but has maintained that the \u201cperfect\u201d call was perfectly acceptable.\n\nThis week came renewed calls to impeach the president, which had quieted somewhat in the weeks since special counsel Robert S. Mueller III testified somewhat anticlimactically on Capitol Hill about his report on electoral interference in the 2016 election, and alleged attempts by the Trump administration to obstruct an investigation into that interference. For the president\u2019s detractors, trying to exert influence on a foreign nation is a more clear-cut example of wrongdoing.\n\nOn Monday night, seven first-term Democrats published an op-ed in the Washington Post, calling on House leaders to consider holding impeachment hearings over Trump\u2019s \u201cflagrant disregard for the law.\u201d More than a dozen Democrats in the House have come over to the pro-impeachment side, meaning that 150 Democrats now support such proceedings, which have not taken place since 1998, when Bill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath about his affair with intern Monica Lewinsky.\n\nNow the pressure is on Pelosi, who it appears can no longer ignore the growing calls for impeachment. At the same time, she knows how risky such a move would be: Republicans are widely believed to have lost seats in the 1998 midterm elections because of their zealous pursuit of Clinton at that time.\n\nIn a letter sent to House Democrats on Sunday, Pelosi announced that acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire would be testifying on Capitol Hill later this week about the Ukraine phone call. She also warned that if the administration attempted to shut down a congressional investigation into the whistleblower complaint, \u201cthey will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\u201d\n\nThe message from Pelosi to the Democratic conference was 303 words long, but it was most notable for the single word it did not contain: \u201cimpeachment.\u201d\n\nProgressives, however, are saying the time for caution is over. \u201cNow is the time to prosecute the case,\u201d says Max Bergmann, who directs the Moscow Project at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning Washington think-tank. \u2019The president committed an impeachable act,\u201d Bergmann said, adding that \u201cit makes Democrats look weak\u201d if they fail to call him to account.\n\nCalifornia congressman Jared Huffman voiced a similar sentiment on Twitter, charging his fellow Democrats with \u201ctragic fecklessness\u201d for failing to impeach Trump. The message has close ten thousand retweets, and close to forty thousand \u201clikes.\u201d\n\nWith pressure rising for Democrats to move against Trump, three Democratic House committee chairmen\u2014Eliot L. Engel of New York, who heads the foreign affairs committee, Schiff of California, and Elijah E. Cummings of the oversight committee, who has been one of Trump\u2019s most vociferous critics in Congress\u2014announced on Monday that they would issue subpoenas unless the Trump administration was forthcoming in producing evidence regarding the call with Zelensky. \u201cIf press reports are accurate,\u201d the three influential Democrats wrote, Trump had committed \u201ca betrayal of the President\u2019s oath of office\u201d that \u201ccannot go unchecked.\u201d\n\nBill Clark via Getty Images UNITED STATES - SEPTEMBER 23: A woman holds an impeach sign as Rep.

The aide characterized those calls as the predictable fulminations of a small but loud fringe.\n\nThat, however, was before a sustained campaign by pro-impeachment Democrats that lasted through Monday and into Tuesday\u2014and could continue indefinitely.\n\n\u201cHouse Democrats\u2019 strategy for holding Donald Trump accountable has been consistent from day one: legislate, investigate, litigate \u2013 and it is working,\u201d the speaker\u2019s aide said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The aide pointed to \u201coversight and legal efforts that \u201chave produced a number of new and damning examples of the corruption and incompetence of this administration,\u201d including investigations into travel expenditures by Vice President Mike Pence and spending by the military at Trump-owned properties.\n\nThe aide explained that Pelosi believes that proceeding on impeachment without an \u201cironclad\u201d case is simply too risky.\n\nBut by Tuesday morning, reports had Pelosi \u201creconsidering\u201d her reluctance to impeach.\n\nFor Don Beyer, a moderate progressive who represents a district in Northern Virginia and is generally in line with House leadership, the time for impeachment has come. He compared Trump\u2019s alleged call to have Biden investigated to the interference Russia conducted on his behalf in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cCongress absolutely cannot allow that,\u201d Beyer told Yahoo News. \u201cI think the case for impeachment is the strongest that it has ever been,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to take action to put a check on this president\u2019s lawless abuses of power.\u201d\n\nPatience finally appears to be running out among Democrats.\n\nRep. Huffman told Yahoo News that he retains faith in Democratic leadership, including Pelosi, and he forcefully discounted any suggestion of a Tea Party-style putsch. But he also expressed a strong frustration with leadership\u2019s inaction.\n\n\u201cI think this is a hinge of history right now,\u201d Huffman said. \u201cWe shot past Watergate levels of corruption long ago.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "The path forward may not be be with House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, who Pelosi has lost confidence in, sources say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8a98bb230000c6026df168.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
