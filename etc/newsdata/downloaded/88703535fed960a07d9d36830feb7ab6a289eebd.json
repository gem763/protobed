And in case any breakdown in discussions triggers a flight to safety, Aviva (LON: ) Investors has been been buying the yen.\n\n\u201cWe expect another empty-handshake meeting,\u201d said Bryan Carter, London-based head of emerging-market fixed-income at BNP Paribas (PA: ) Asset. Ultimately, no substantive agreement will be reached, he said.\n\nEmerging-market stocks have rebounded as much as 5.8% from early September, when China and the U.S. announced they would hold face-to-face negotiations once again. The rally has since petered out after President Donald Trump said he won\u2019t seek an interim agreement and global growth showed further signs of deterioration as the year-long trade war dragged on. Impeachment proceedings have also spurred concern that it may hinder Trump\u2019s hand in the negotiations.\n\nBelow are comments from investors and analysts:\n\nSergey Dergachev, senior portfolio manager at Union Investment in Frankfurt:\n\nExpectations for a breakthrough are \u201cvery low,\u201d though it will be important to see how the meeting will end and the mood during the meeting\n\nFuture steps are also crucial, such as when the next round of talks will be\n\nDergachev said he\u2019s positioned \u201cmildly defensive,\u201d and is focusing on the credit quality of his holdings\n\nWerner Gey van Pittius, co-head of emerging-market fixed income at Investec Asset Management in London:\n\nThe trade war will last longer than what the market is hoping because it\u2019s not just about trade. There\u2019s an element in the U.S. that is afraid of \u201cthe geopolitical rise of China\u201d and that is much bigger than just trade right now\n\nChina is preparing for the next decade and trying to reduce the impact of the trade war by opening up their markets, attracting capital, and moving away from U.S. influence by selling Treasuries and buying gold. Their time horizon is beyond the U.S. elections\n\nHe is taking a long duration strategy in his bond portfolio as the trade war raises the risk of a recession\n\nBNP Paribas\n\nCarter at(PA: ) Asset:\n\nPolitics are driving the negotiations, and not economics\n\nThe upcoming 2020 presidential election, and impeachment investigations in the House, are the dominant context for the trade meeting\n\nCarter said he plans to continue cutting exposure to junk-rated bonds even if there was a positive outcome from the meeting. That\u2019s because the firm doesn\u2019t expect any comprehensive agreement will be reached that would reverse the negative economic effects of the trade war\n\nAviva\n\nStuart Ritson, emerging-market bond fund manager at(LON: ) Investors in Singapore:\n\nIt is hard to be too optimistic on the outcome of trade talks given the narrow scope of the discussions\n\nThe firm\u2019s local-currency bond portfolio is \u201crelatively defensive\u201d at the moment, given the weak global growth backdrop. It is also positioned for further easing by EM policy makers and has increased exposure to the yen, given its anti-cyclical properties, and still attractive valuations\n\nING Groep\n\nRobert Carnell, chief economist at(AS: ) NV in Singapore, writes in a note:", "description": "Emerging-Market Investors Don\u2019t Expect an Olive Branch in Trade Talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic185925f8e3459c081559858c4c845982.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
