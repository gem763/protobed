The storm is expected to pass just to the north and west of the islands.\n\nJerry is expected to be a strong tropical storm on its closest approach. A tropical storm has maximum sustained winds of up to 73 mph with higher gusts.\n\n\"Bermuda can experience strong winds, soaking rain and rough surf as a result of Jerry,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Mary Gilbert said.\n\n\"These impacts will be amplified if Jerry passes right over the islands,\" she added. However, this scenario appears unlikely at this point.\n\nJust this past week, former Major Hurricane Humberto unleashed fierce winds as it passed just to the north of Bermuda.\n\nBermuda's building codes require dwellings to withstand sustained wind speeds of 110 mph (177 km/h), which is the equivalent of a high-end Category 2 hurricane. A majority of properties are made of stone and mortar.\n\nAs a result, structural damage is unlikely to occur with Jerry, even with its projected path very close to Bermuda.\n\nHowever, gusty winds can toss around loose items like toys and cause them to become potentially deadly projectiles. Isolated power outages and tree damage may also occur.\n\nResidents should make sure to secure or safely house any outdoor furniture, planters or decorative items ahead of Jerry's arrival.\n\nWaterspouts can occur within Jerry's rain bands.\n\nThe rain and wind could hinder any continued recovery efforts from Humberto, according to Gilbert.\n\nConditions will dramatically improve across Bermuda later Wednesday as Jerry gets swept northeastward.\n\nIn the wake of Jerry, several other tropical disturbances are being closely monitored across the Atlantic basin, including Karen.", "description": "Forecasters believe Tropical Storm Jerry will track close enough to Bermuda to deliver a period of soaking rainfall, gusty winds and rough seas prior to midweek.Jerry weakened from a Category 1 hurricane to a tropical storm early Saturday morning while passing a few hundred miles to the north of the", "authors": ["Renee Duff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1Pqn4Lrl09XhYPPgzEjvSA--~B/aD0zNjY7dz02NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/accuweather_297/8f0508a5ef7abe983505623d0fa9e044", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
