Which is why we have People\u2019s Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed products and single out the most convincing ones. (You can learn more about our rating system and how we pick each item here.)\n\nAnd while we\u2019ve written about lots of skin-care products \u2014 including the best acne-fighting cleanser, the best moisturizers for mature skin, and the best products for redness and rosacea \u2014 here we\u2019ve rounded up the best Korean beauty products as praised by the most enthusiastic reviewers on Amazon.\n\nBest-rated Korean beauty product\n\nElizavecca Milky Piggy Carbonated Clay Mask 4.2 stars, 5,697 reviews Reviewers raved about this mask, saying it was fun to use, banished blackheads, and was effective on different skin types, all at an affordable price. One reviewer, who says she struggles with dry skin and hormonal acne, writes, \u201cI\u2019ve been buying this mask for a little over a year now and can verify that it is totally worth the hype \u2026 I tried many more-expensive masks, but I also have very sensitive skin and previous products either left me itchy and irritated or had no effect. This mask has completely cured all of my skin problems.\u201d Another shopper writes, \u201cI use this two-to-three times a week because I have extremely oily skin \u2026 This stuff cleans deep into the pores.\u201d Reviewers love the bubbly texture of the mask \u2014 which one says \u201cfeels like spongy Jell-O\u201d \u2014 and found it left their skin feeling refreshed. \u201cFirst? It\u2019s weird. Second. It\u2019s awesome,\u201d writes one. \u201cI use this every few days to keep the dead skin from building up on my face \u2014 even with washing, I get a lot of clogged pores, and my skin is very dry to begin with. This smooths out my texture a bit and takes off the dead layers.\u201d And shoppers agree that the price is right. \u201cGreat price point for what it actually does to your skin,\u201d says one. Another writes, \u201cIt\u2019s really well priced and absolutely cleared up my dark and huge pores.\u201d $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest-rated (less expensive) Korean beauty product\n\nNature Republic Aloe Vera Gel 4.4 stars, 478 reviews \u201cDo not underestimate the product [because of the] price,\u201d says one shopper. \u201cIt works better than any other pricey products.\u201d Plenty of reviewers agree, writing, \u201cIt\u2019s a big container, and the price is amazing compared to other products I\u2019ve tried,\u201d \u201cThe container it comes in is massive for the price, and you really don\u2019t need much of it so a little goes a long way,\u201d and \u201cSoothes and refreshes skin at a bargain price!\u201d It worked especially well for those with acne: \u201cI have struggled with acne for a long time and have tried everything from Accutane to Proactiv to Rodan + Fields,\u201d says one user. \u201cThis works wonders. It keeps my face and skin clear and acne free.\u201d And one reviewer even calls it a \u201cmiracle gel,\u201d adding, \u201cIt helps my skin to stay hydrated, especially during summer. It will keep your pores tight, and it is very refreshing \u2026 it has improved my skin and removed whiteheads and blackheads on my face. I\u2019m glad I found this product.\u201d $7 at Amazon Buy\n\nAnd now some micro-picks for every type of Korean beauty product you might be looking for.\n\nInnisfree Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam 4.2 stars, 671 reviews Shoppers with oily skin particularly like this cleanser. \u201cIf you have VERY oily skin, and I mean oil-slick-style, this is a dream product,\u201d writes one. Another says, \u201cIt is wonderful for people with extremely oily skin. It does not dry out the skin, but for me what it does is help control how much or how quickly my face will get oily again.\u201d Those with acne say this wash helped clear up breakouts. \u201cI\u2019ve had really bad acne since I was in my teens,\u201d one reviewer says. \u201cI would get it on my jaw, chin, and T-zone. It was pretty severe acne, and since I started using this, it cleared my skin up. I only get breakouts every once in a while, and they aren\u2019t even that bad anymore.\u201d Another writes, \u201cThis face wash changed my life \u2026 My acne reduced so much because of this, plus my acne spots have been fading away \u2026 Thank God for this product. I recommend this a million times. You\u2019ll not regret it.\u201d $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest Korean-beauty face mask\n\nSKEDERM Snail Jelly Face Mask Pack of 10 4.5 stars, 588 reviews Shoppers say although this mask was a little slimy because of the snail jelly, it left their skin \u201crejuvenated,\u201d hydrated, and moisturized. \u201cHoly-grail skin-care product for me,\u201d writes one reviewer. \u201cOne of the few skin-care items I will continue to repurchase any time I run out of. 100 percent recommend.\u201d Another claims, \u201cThey make such a difference compared to most masks. Not only do they leave my skin feeling soft, they truly do hydrate the skin to the point where my fine lines nearly disappear.\u201d It\u2019s a hit among those with sensitive skin, too. \u201cI\u2019m super-picky about my face masks because I have super dry and sensitive, eczema-prone skin,\u201d writes one shopper. \u201cThis mask doesn\u2019t sting my face, and it\u2019s insanely moisturizing. I bought this set like three times already. I like it a lot.\u201d Another says, \u201cHave supersensitive eyes, and this product doesn\u2019t bother me at all \u2026 Beyond happy.\u201d $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest Korean-beauty soothing moisturizer\n\nKlairs Rich Moist Soothing cream $19 (was $25, now 24% off) 4.3 stars, 202 reviews Those with very sensitive skin praise this soothing moisturizer highly. \u201cI have extremely sensitive skin, and when I use a product that my skin rejects, my face immediately turns into a red inflamed histamine fireball and looks totally raw,\u201d writes one reviewer. \u201cAfter trying a lot of different Korean moisturizing creams, this is one of the few that does NOT make my face sting. In fact, I basically don\u2019t feel much impact at all, which is exactly what I want.\u201d Another shopper with \u201csupersensitive skin\u201d that\u2019s prone to breakouts says, \u201cThis is the hands-down best moisturizer I\u2019ve ever used.\u201d Others who describe themselves as prone to breakouts had similar results. \u201cI\u2019ve finally found a holy-grail moisturizer I will never be able to let go,\u201d writes one. \u201cI have very acne-prone skin, so anything can trigger my skin and make me break out. After discovering Klairs products last year, my skin has completely changed.\u201d $19 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest Korean-beauty sunscreen\n\nEtude House Sunprise Sun Milk 4.2 stars, 1,316 reviews Those with oily skin who found that other sunscreens broke them out raved about this product. \u201cThis is the best face sunscreen I have ever tried,\u201d writes one reviewer with oily, acne-prone skin. \u201cI hate wearing sunscreen on my face because it would always break me out. It has a nice watery, milky texture, matte finish, and feels so light. It definitely didn\u2019t make my skin oily or greasy feeling.\u201d Another shopper who calls this her \u201choly-grail sunscreen\u201d also praised the light texture, writing, \u201cTotally invisible when it\u2019s applied, very minimal scent, not chalky like other sunscreens I\u2019ve tried.\u201d And one reviewer, a self-proclaimed \u201cavid sunblock user for decades\u201d writes that this one is a favorite: \u201cExcellent product, I highly recommend.\u201d $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest Korean-beauty overnight mask\n\nCOSRX Ultimate Nourishing Rice Overnight Spa Mask 4.2 stars, 202 reviews Reviewers who put this mask on before going to sleep say they woke up with healthy, glow-y skin. \u201cIt makes my skin so supple and bouncy that by the morning, I can\u2019t stop squishing my cheeks because they\u2019re so soft,\u201d says one. Another shopper, who says she used to have severe acne and now has discoloration and scars, writes, \u201cI\u2019ve used this for a couple weeks now, and I see a difference. I feel like it has helped my scars, because my skin is so hydrated and plump. I\u2019m in love with this stuff.\u201d Shoppers say that despite its being an overnight mask, it absorbed quickly enough for them not to worry about staining their pillows. \u201cI love this overnight mask so much that I use it every night at the end of my skin-care routine. It makes my skin bright and glow-y and less red,\u201d says one. \u201cIt also spreads extremely easily and dries decently quickly \u2014 at least I never worry about it getting on my pillow.\u201d Others saw a decrease in redness after using it. \u201cMy face is noticeably calmer and less red the mornings after using this product,\u201d writes one satisfied customer. $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest Korean-beauty exfoliator\n\nSkinfood Black Sugar Mask Wash Off Exfoliator 4.4 stars, 1,320 reviews Those with sensitive skin who still want to slough off dead and dry bits highly praise this exfoliating mask. \u201cI have very dry, very sensitive skin, and this mask is one of the only products I can find that doesn\u2019t burn it. It leaves it smooth, soft, and bright,\u201d writes one shopper. \u201cThis is perhaps the best mask I\u2019ve ever used, and once it\u2019s gone I\u2019ll definitely be ordering more.\u201d Another reviewer says, \u201cThis mask is unreal \u2026 rub it into the skin, then let it sit for 10 minutes. Wash off and your skin will literally feel like the supple dream skin you pray for.\u201d And one shopper, who writes about having tried many scrubs in the past, describes this one as providing particularly long-lasting results: \u201cIt kept my skin exfoliated for two weeks without any dry skin peeking through. It left my skin feeling refreshed and baby smooth.\u201d $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest Korean-beauty peel\n\nSecret Key Lemon D-Toc Peeling Gel 4.2 stars, 463 reviews \u201cI literally never leave reviews, but after struggling with my skin for 20 years, I felt others might be able to relate,\u201d begins one reviewer who quickly fell in love with this peeling gel that exfoliates dead skin. \u201cI used this product twice, and I already notice a difference in the tone and texture of my skin.\u201d Says another, \u201cMy skin tends to flake on my chin and around my nose. This peels away the dead skin and smooths the area without drying my skin.\u201d A third mentions that using this as a supplementary product is transformative for skin so dry that lotion can\u2019t penetrate it. \u201cEven lotion wouldn\u2019t keep my skin from drying and flaking,\u201d this shopper writes. \u201cThis product is the solution.\u201d Reviewers love how smooth it left their skin. \u201cIt smells amazing, is easy to wash off, and makes my face feel SO SMOOTH after rinsing. I love it because it feels like an exfoliator, peel, wash, and brightening serum in one,\u201d writes one. Another says, \u201cIt\u2019s gentle and completely nonabrasive, yet it practically dissolves the dead, rough skin from my face, leaving it so smooth.\u201d $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest Korean-beauty cleansing balm\n\nBanila Co Clean It Zero Original Cleansing Balm 4.3 stars, 588 reviews Shoppers love that this three-in-one cleansing balm melted away even tough-to-erase makeup. \u201cThis one is by far the best cleanser I have ever used,\u201d writes one reviewer. \u201cI always use thick waterproof mascara, and this cleanser COMPLETELY removes it.\u201d Another says, \u201cI absolutely love it and feel stupid for not getting it sooner! Since using this stuff, I wash my face every night because it\u2019s EASY, not messy, and literally takes less than five minutes.\u201d And even though the balm deeply cleans skin, reviewers found it was very gentle and nonirritating. \u201cThis product does what it says it\u2019s supposed to, and that\u2019s to remove every little bit of makeup from your face. The best part is it does this without going Rambo on your skin,\u201d writes one user. \u201cThis cleansing balm is gentle, soothing, and moisturizing. I have sensitive skin and a lot of products are too harsh, so this might be an item that those with sensitivity issues may want to try.\u201d $17 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest Korean-beauty double-cleansing duo\n\nThe Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Foam 4.2 stars, 1,426 reviews Those looking for a double-cleansing duo found this pair from the Face Shop got the job done. \u201cIT WORKS,\u201d writes one reviewer. \u201cI have been using this combination of products (along with toner, essence, ampoule, and serum) for about four days now and my skin has never looked so good. I have not broken out, and I have not seen a single dry flake. Would buy this again and again.\u201d Another says, \u201cLove this combo for a double cleanse. Oil cleanser feels nice and silky.\u201d For those who haven\u2019t tried double cleansing but want to, one shopper thinks these products would be a good place to start. \u201cI have been looking into double cleansing for a while and bought this product since I heard it was good for beginners,\u201d writes this recommender. \u201cI was not disappointed! This product has been amazing. My skin is so much brighter and gives me the glow I\u2019ve been looking for. My acne scars are less noticeable, and my skin tone is more even.\u201d $17 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest Korean-beauty collagen cream\n\nEtude House Moistfull Collagen Cream 4.3 stars, 428 reviews Reviewers rave about this moisturizer, with one finding it stood up to much more expensive options: \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking \u2014 at this price point, how great can a moisturizer be?\u201d writes one shopper. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s my holy grail of moisturizers, and I\u2019ve tried Clinique, SKII, La Prairie, La Mer, La Roche-Posay, Av\u00e8ne \u2026 The amount I\u2019ve spent trying to find a good anti-aging moisturizer is almost obscene, considering the modest price tag on this simple little orange jar.\u201d Other reviewers say this product left their skin feeling particularly soft. \u201cThis collagen cream is really nice. My skin feels so much better and softer all day long,\u201d says one shopper. Another writes, \u201cI don\u2019t think my face has ever felt this smooth and soft.\u201d $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest Korean-beauty gel cleanser\n\nCOSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser 4.1 stars, 1,139 reviews Those who want a squeaky-clean post-wash feeling without creating dry, stripped skin in the meantime love this gel cleanser. \u201cI cannot describe the goodness that is this gel cleanser. It cleans without stripping my skin to the point of super, super clean and leaves my skin feeling refreshed,\u201d comments one shopper. \u201cI have noticed my acne breakouts becoming milder, and my skin is glowing after using this cleanser for about three months.\u201d Another reviewer, who says she has been using this cleanser daily for close to two years, writes, \u201cIt thoroughly cleans without that stripped-tight feeling. Hubby helped himself to my bottle in the shower, and he immediately converted to it.\u201d $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
