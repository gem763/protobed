That is why we have this joint committee so that there is no overlap in the roles of the village development and security committee,\u201d he said, adding that it will be a waste of resources if this were to occur.\n\nHe said the decision to expand MPKK to Sarawak goes against the decision of Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad to set up the joint committee.\n\n\u201cThis joint committee must be inclusive, covering social, economic and other issues that concern Sarawak,\u201d he said.\n\nOn electoral reform, the chief minister said there are some issues that PBB agrees on and there are others which need to be deliberated further by the electoral reform committee so they will not conflict with state laws.\n\n\u201cWhatever the reforms are, they need to be discussed by the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly further. But, of course, we are also pro-reform, for example, on the question of 18-year-olds being election candidates and voters.\n\n\u201cBut there are other matters which have to be discussed further so as to follow state laws,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated Articles Sarawak CM foregoes Mercedes, opts for Korean hydrogen-fuelled car Roof collapses onto Sarawak school canteen Abang Johari never suggested immigration relaxation for Sabahans to enter Sarawak, CM\u2019s Office clarifies", "description": "KUCHING, Oct 24 \u2014 Parti Pesaka Bumiputra Bersatu (PBB) is insisting that the so-called \u201cadvance payment\u201d of Sarawak\u2019s loans with Putrajaya must be used to fix dilapidated schools in the...", "authors": ["Sulok Tawie"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5tA3P5nXK3JVKcf1.1ZwUw--~B/aD01NTc7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/mmail.com.my/441bedfd47ed316b6c6b36af96e0ebff", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
