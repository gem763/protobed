Policymakers voiced concerns about its potential to destabilize the global financial system and erode the power of countries to control monetary policy. Others said it could undermine users' privacy.\n\nThe G7 report said authorities should apply to stablecoins existing rules on payments and anti-money laundering, as well as capital market and banking standards.\n\nIt added that new rules may be needed to deal with the emerging technology, with the Financial Stability Board - a body created after the 2008 financial crisis - assessing related regulatory issues before reporting to the Group of 20 wealthy nations in April.\n\nStablecoins had before Libra attracted virtually no attention from global policymakers, partly because of their relatively tiny size. The biggest, Tether, is only a fraction of the size of bitcoin, the No.1 cryptocurrency.\n\nFacebook says Libra is designed to address inefficiencies in the global payments system, which is beset by high fees, lengthy transfer times and a lack of reliability. That hinders, and in many cases prevents, people from making cross-border payments, especially in developing countries.\n\nThe G7 said central banks, finance ministries and other authorities should work to address these weaknesses in payments systems. The public sector, it said, should step up efforts to bring people lacking access to banking services into the financial system.\n\nIt added that central banks, by themselves and in cooperation with one another, should look at issuing their own digital currencies.\n\n(Reporting by Tom Wilson and Balazs Koranyi; Editing by Paul Simao)", "description": "LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook's plans to launch its Libra cryptocurrency faced a new hurdle on Thursday when the Group of Seven wealthy nations said such \"stablecoins\" should not be allowed to launch until the profound international risks they pose are addressed.", "authors": ["Tom Wilson"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
