(Thom Bridge/Independent Record, File)\n\nHELENA, Mont. (AP) \u2014 Montana Secretary of State Corey Stapleton put tens of thousands of miles on a state-owned pickup truck and used it extensively during weekends and holidays in addition to other travel that legislative auditors said violated state policy, an Associated Press review has found.\n\nA state audit of the secretary of state's office covering two fiscal years ending in June 2018 found Stapleton's travel to his home in Billings violated policy. After auditors questioned the use, Stapleton returned the vehicle to the motor pool in March 2019.\n\nAn AP examination of the Stapleton's use of the truck between July 2018 and March 2019 found the first-term Republican, who is running for Montana's U.S. House seat, improperly used the truck to regularly travel from Helena to his home in Billings.\n\nOver the entire lease, he also traveled thousands of miles in the 2015 GMC Sierra during weekends and holiday periods when he had no official events scheduled, according to the AP review of government documents obtained through public-records requests.\n\nStapleton declined multiple requests for interviews by the AP. His office manager and spokeswoman, Susan Ames, said Stapleton traveled to fulfill his job responsibilities and a long-term vehicle lease was the most efficient and least costly way of doing so.\n\n\"Three government agencies have investigated and found no wrongdoing by anyone in the agency, including the secretary,\" Ames said. She did not respond to an email asking which agencies found no wrongdoing.\n\nAuditors found nearly half of Stapleton's travel over the first 18 months of the lease violated a policy that says state-owned vehicles can only be used for commuting distances of less than 30 miles (48 kilometers) and only if the employee is on call for a quick response to an emergency that threatens life or property. The audit could not conclude how the vehicle was used 25% of the time.\n\nThe audit, completed earlier this year, found Stapleton improperly used the pickup truck to commute from Helena to Billings, where he said he \"teleworked\" part time, from January 2017 through June 2018. He had driven the truck just over 45,000 miles (72,417 kilometers) at that point.\n\nThe audit findings were turned over to the Department of Justice, which forwarded them to Helena police in June.\n\nHelena police Officer Jayson Zander, who led the investigation, said Stapleton told him that while he doesn't need to respond to emergencies, his job requires him to be available at all times.\n\n\"He compared his job to that of the Governor or Attorney General,\" Zander wrote in his findings. \"He explained that if there was a call in Glendive for a report of election fraud, he would have to respond and could not tell them that they would have to wait until Monday.\"\n\nStapleton also acknowledged using the pickup to travel to medical appointments in Bozeman, Zander said in his report. It is a violation of government policy to use a state vehicle for personal travel.\n\nHelena's city attorney, Thomas Jodoin, declined to file charges. He said in July that the one-year statute of limitations for filing a misdemeanor charge had expired.\n\nBut public records show Stapleton continued to use the pickup from July 2018 through March 2019 to travel to Billings as well as other events around the state, tallying another 25,000 miles (40,232 kilometers), before the pickup was returned to the motor pool.\n\nThat additional travel was not reviewed by auditors or Helena police.\n\nHelena police investigated \"and my office reviewed, the allegations that were presented to us,\" Jodoin said. \"No allegations of unlawful use of a state vehicle from July 1, 2018 to when the vehicle was returned to the state motor pool were provided to HPD or my office.\"\n\nAn AP analysis of Stapleton's daily schedule and records of the truck's mileage and fueling dates found that in addition to commuting to Billings, he traveled hundreds of miles on weekends and holidays when he did not have any official events scheduled.\n\n\u2014 The pickup was fueled up Friday morning, June 9, 2017, in Hardin and two days later in Garryowen after having traveled more than 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers). The pickup averaged about 350 miles (563 kilometers) per tank, so it was likely filled up two other times between those dates. The towns are 19 miles (31 kilometers) apart.", "description": "Montana Secretary of State Corey Stapleton put tens of thousands of miles on a state-owned pickup truck and used it extensively during weekends and holidays in addition to other travel that legislative auditors said violated state policy, an Associated Press review has found.
