And no one should doubt his wisdom either after this exchange on ABC\u2019s This Week. When Martha Raddatz attempted to draw the former Secretary of Defense into judgment on Ukraine-Gate (or whatever we\u2019re calling it), Mattis conducted \u2026 a tactical recon in force to the rear.\n\nAlternate headline: James Mattis Speaks for America.\n\n.@MarthaRaddatz: \"Should a president be asking foreign leaders to investigate political opponents?\" Former Defense Sec. James Mattis: \"This is is not something I have any background on\u2026I really prefer to talk about things I know more about.\" https://t.co/dQI0GVFuCn pic.twitter.com/inFwaWll8L \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) September 23, 2019\n\nRADDATZ: Secretary Mattis, I just want to turn to something else that\u2019s in the news, and that\u2019s the whistleblower investigation. President Trump just said \u201cI hope they can put out that conversation.\u201d Should a president be asking foreign leaders to investigate political opponents? MATTIS: Yeah, Martha, this is not something I have background on. I don\u2019t know anything more than what I read in the news. And apparently no one has seen the complaint, so I really prefer to talk about things I know more about.\n\nEr, why ask Mattis about this at all? Yes, Mattis served on Trump\u2019s Cabinet, and yes, Mattis just wrote a book about leadership, but those don\u2019t give Mattis any particular insight into this controversy. The conversation took place nine months after Mattis left the government, and Mattis wasn\u2019t involved in diplomacy that didn\u2019t relate to military strategy and partnerships. This looks like an attempt by Raddatz to basically brace any Trump official on the question, whether it makes sense to ask them or not. Mattis\u2019 reply was brief and polite but also firm: Ask me questions within my portfolio, please.\n\nEarlier, though, Raddatz did address this with an administration official with an actual connection to the controversy. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insisted that no undue pressure was put on Ukraine, and furthermore the question of Joe Biden\u2019s actions with Ukraine is a legitimate issue to pursue:\n\nRADDATZ: And I want to turn to this whistleblower complaint, Mr. Secretary. The complaint involving the president and a phone call with a foreign leader to the director of national intelligence inspector general. That\u2019s where the complaint was launched by the whistle-blower. \u201cThe Wall Street Journal\u201d is reporting that President Trump pressed the president of Ukraine eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son. What do you know about those conversations? POMPEO: So, you just gave me a report about a I.C. whistle-blower complaint, none of which I\u2019ve seen. I can tell you about this administration\u2019s policies with Ukraine. I remember the previous administration was begged \u2014 begged by the Ukrainian people to deliver defensive arms, so that they could protect themselves from Vladimir Putin and Russia. And they gave them blankets. This administration took seriously the responsibility of the Ukrainian people. We\u2019ve provided now on multiple occasions resources, so that the \u2014 the Ukrainians can defend themselves. We\u2019ve worked on that. We \u2014 we\u2019re working \u2014 we\u2019ll see President Zelensky this week. We want a good relationship with the Ukrainian people. RADDATZ: Let me read something that the\u2026 POMPEO: We want them to have freedom and independence, but \u2014 but Martha, if it\u2019s the case that\u2026 RADDATZ: You say you know nothing about this, but let me \u2014 let me \u2014 let me ask you this question. The Ukrainian presidential readout of the conversation said they discussed \u2014 quote \u2014 \u201cinvestigation of corruption cases which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA.\u201d The president tweeted Saturday: \u201cIt was a perfectly fine and respectful conversation.\u201d Do you think it\u2019s \u2014 quote \u2014 \u201cperfectly fine\u201d to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent? POMPEO: I think I saw a statement from the Ukrainian foreign minister yesterday, said there was no pressure applied in the course of the conversation. I do think \u2014 I do think, if Vice President Biden behaved inappropriately, if he was protecting his son and intervened with the Ukrainian leadership in a way that was corrupt, I do think we need to get to the bottom of that, Martha. And I \u2014 I hope that we will. I hope that, if Vice President Biden engaged in behavior that was inappropriate, I hope the American people will come to learn that. America can\u2019t have\u2026 RADDATZ: We\u2019ve seen no evidence of that yet. But I want to go back to the question. POMPEO: America cannot have our elections interfered with. America cannot have our elections interfered with. And if \u2014 if that\u2019s what took place there, if there was that kind of activity engaged in by Vice President Biden, we need to know. RADDATZ: There\u2019s no evidence of that yet. But if the conversation was perfectly fine, as President Trump said, why not release the transcript or a portion to the public? POMPEO: I will have \u2014 the White House will have to explain. They \u2014 they \u2014 you know, Martha, they \u2014 we don\u2019t release transcripts very often. It\u2019s the \u2014 it\u2019s the rare case. Those are private conversations between world leaders. And it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to do so, except in \u2014 in the most extreme circumstances. There\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s no \u2014 there\u2019s no evidence that that would be appropriate here at this point.\n\nWell, we\u2019ll see. The White House doesn\u2019t release transcripts of these conversations very often, it\u2019s true, but they may not have much choice in this case. The intel community will likely leak it sooner or later to Congress, and it might be better to pre-empt that by publicly releasing it first along with their \u201cperfect\u201d argument.\n\nWhat seems a bit surprising at this point is Pompeo\u2019s professed ignorance of the conversation, even at this point. It\u2019s been almost two months since the phone call, and several days since it became an issue. Has Pompeo not requested a briefing on the conversation? That seems oddly incurious for the nation\u2019s top diplomat, who would have to operate under whatever agreements are made in those kinds of bilateral discussions, if any.\n\nOne would think that Pompeo would be curious enough over the last few days to ask for a look at the transcript himself first before going on the Sunday talk shows, where the topic was bound to arise. Still, if Pompeo hasn\u2019t been briefed, it might be because there was nothing in the call worth briefing about. It\u2019s a good reminder that we should wait for the evidence to emerge before leaping to conclusions about either its \u201cperfection\u201d or its \u201ctreason.\u201d Like most hysterias whipped up these days, the answer is likely to fall in between those poles, and it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess to which of these the truth comes closest.", "description": "\"Apparently, no one has seen the complaint ...\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mattis-abc.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
