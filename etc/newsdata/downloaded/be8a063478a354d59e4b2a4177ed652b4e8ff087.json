I hope I don\u2019t sound ridiculous \u2026 Sorry to Keke Palmer, whose previously pristine mind palace has now been sullied with the knowledge of who Dick Cheney is.\n\nLast week, a clip of the Hustlers star taking a lie-detector test and admitting she had \u201cno idea\u201d who the former vice president was went viral.\n\nIn the full video, posted by Vanity Fair, Palmer is asked if her character True Jackson, from Nickelodeon\u2019s True Jackson, VP \u2014 a show about a 15-year-old who is made vice president of a high-end fashion company \u2014 was a better vice president than Cheney. Faced with a picture of Cheney on a plane, Palmer looked taken aback and said, \u201cWho the hell is \u2026 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate to say it. I hope I don\u2019t sound ridiculous. I don\u2019t know who this man is,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI mean, he could be walking down the street, and I wouldn\u2019t know a thing.\u201d\n\nThen, pushing the picture with the resigned, pitying energy of someone putting down a sick animal, she concluded: \u201cSorry to this man.\u201d\n\nThe clip instantly exploded into a meme, and \u201cSorry to this man\u201d became a succinct, tidy way to dismiss someone.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know her\u201d passing the baton to \u201cSorry to this man\u201d pic.twitter.com/sBrOxI1D6F \u2014 Kyle Gamboni (@KyleGamboni) September 16, 2019\n\nDrew Barrymore in 50 first dates: pic.twitter.com/EwCwZs4eTO \u2014 I AM SORRY TO THIS MAN (@foreverignorant) September 14, 2019\n\nI hate to say it, I hope I don't sound ridiculous, I don't know who this man is. I mean, he could be walking down the street I wouldn't... I wouldn't know a thing. Sorry to this man. https://t.co/nScIDqFwDC \u2014 Ira thee Third (@ira) September 16, 2019\n\nAnd how beautiful for Palmer, that she could move through the world unburdened by the knowledge of the instrumental role Cheney played in leading the United States into the Iraq war, or that time he shot his friend in the face, or the 2018 film Vice. Alas, nothing pure can last, and after her video went viral, Palmer\u2019s mom taught her the way of the world, and of former veeps.\n\n\u201cIt was so crazy. My mom was like, \u2018You didn\u2019t know who Dick Cheney is?\u2019\u201d she said during a panel at the Brooklyn Expo Center, according to \u201cPage Six.\u201d \u201cI said, \u2018We don\u2019t even talk about Dick Cheney!\u2019 and then she tried to tell me what he was about, and I said, \u2018I see why we don\u2019t talk about him!\u2019\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
