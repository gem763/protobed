Even more unusual was how Bransfield obtained the cash he gave away.\n\nThe untold story behind those gifts illustrates how $21 million was moved from a church-owned hospital in Wheeling, W.Va., to be used at Bransfield\u2019s discretion. It adds a new dimension to a financial scandal that has rippled through the Catholic Church since Bransfield\u2019s ouster last year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA Post investigation found that the money Bransfield sent to Farrell was routed from Wheeling Hospital to the Bishop\u2019s Fund, a charity created by Bransfield with the stated purpose of helping the residents of West Virginia, tax filings show.\n\nAs Bransfield prepared to write the first of his personal checks to Farrell, a church official arranged to transfer money from the Bishop\u2019s Fund into a diocese bank account \u2014 and then from there to Bransfield\u2019s personal bank account, an internal email obtained by The Post shows.\n\n\u201cBishop Bransfield made very specific requests,\u201d said Bryan Minor, a Bishop\u2019s Fund board member and diocese employee who wrote the email and arranged the transfers for the gifts to Farrell. \u201cHe wanted to have a discretionary fund.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBransfield used Bishop\u2019s Fund money for a variety of purposes, including church projects in West Virginia that burnished his reputation as a generous benefactor.\n\nAD\n\nThe bishop also drew on it to send the second check to Farrell for the apartment, this time for $15,000, church financial records and emails show.\n\nIn all, $321,000 was sent out of West Virginia, in apparent contradiction to the stated purpose of the Bishop\u2019s Fund, The Post found. Church officials have declined to identify the out-of-state recipients.\n\nThe hospital was the charity\u2019s only source of funding, tax filings and hospital audits show. As a nonprofit institution that relies heavily on federal funding through Medicare, the hospital is subject to restrictions on how it uses its money.\n\nAD\n\nIn the interview with The Post over the summer, Bransfield defended the cash gifts to Farrell, saying they were \u201cfunds that I had raised.\u201d He and his attorney did not respond to subsequent questions about The Post\u2019s findings.\n\nAD\n\nBransfield stepped down in September 2018 amid allegations he misused church money and sexually harassed seminarians and young priests, claims that he has denied. He has since been stripped of his clerical authority and ordered to leave the West Virginia diocese.\n\nDuring his 13-year tenure at the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston, Bransfield spent millions of dollars of diocese money on extravagances, including travel on chartered jets, lavish furnishings at his official residence and nearly 600 cash gifts to fellow clergymen, according to the findings of an internal church investigation previously obtained by The Post.\n\nChurch officials have declined to release the investigators\u2019 confidential report, but a Post story in June detailed many of its findings.\n\nAD\n\nTo support his lavish spending, Bransfield long relied on oil revenue from land in Texas that was left to the diocese more than a century ago. The church investigators wrote that he created the Bishop\u2019s Fund in 2014 to serve as a \u201cvehicle\u201d to also access and spend hospital money, a finding that has not previously been reported.\n\nAD\n\nThe Post determined that the money sent to Farrell and others outside the state originated at the hospital by examining tax filings and internal church documents and emails as well as other records.\n\nMinor, the diocese\u2019s human resources director, told The Post in an interview that he understood the transfers to be legally permissible and properly authorized.\n\nAD\n\nSpokesmen for the diocese and hospital declined requests for comment about the Bishop\u2019s Fund.\n\nTwo members of the hospital board, Sister Mary Palmer and Richard Polinsky, said in interviews that they had never heard of the Bishop\u2019s Fund and did not recall approving multimillion-dollar transfers.\n\nA third board member, retired FBI agent Thomas Burgoyne, questioned how any money that started in the hospital ended up passing through Bransfield\u2019s personal account. \u201cBased on my experience in law enforcement, this is something that needs to be looked at,\u201d said Burgoyne.\n\nAD\n\nTwo tax law specialists and a former federal prosecutor who examined related documents at The Post\u2019s request agreed, citing laws that restrict how federally funded hospitals and nonprofit groups can use money.\n\nAD\n\nUnder one federal law, hospitals that receive substantial federal benefits through programs such as Medicare are prohibited from directing money to any entity or person without proper authority or purpose. Under another, charity money may not be used to unduly benefit an individual.\n\n\u201cLining the pockets of private citizens, even when those private citizens are priests, is a violation of charities and tax law,\u201d said Jill Horwitz, professor and vice dean of the University of California at Los Angeles law school.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Justice Department has sought information about the transfers to the Bishop\u2019s Fund as part of a lawsuit that accuses the hospital of defrauding the federal government of millions of dollars by filing false claims for Medicare reimbursement. Hospital officials deny the allegations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA diocesan windfall\n\nFrom the time he became bishop in 2005, Bransfield poured church money into building projects and other work, while also spending on personal luxuries for himself, according to the confidential investigative report.\n\nBut he faced mounting criticism from parishioners for his extravagances after local news accounts of his spending on his church residence, a chauffeur and a personal chef. Bransfield has defended his spending as appropriate.\n\nBy 2014, the bishop was seeking a way to continue spending on projects of his choosing without \u201cmaking the subsequent donations appear to be coming from the DWC,\u201d according to the confidential investigative report, using the shorthand for the diocese.\n\nAD\n\nHe found an answer in the coffers of Wheeling Hospital.\n\nBransfield, as bishop, served as chairman of the hospital board. Long a money-loser, the hospital experienced a financial turnaround under consultants hired to lead it after Bransfield\u2019s arrival in Wheeling. Revenue soared and cash on hand skyrocketed, financial statements show. Much of its revenue came from Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement.\n\nAD\n\nThe hospital\u2019s operations included a self-insurance entity, Mountaineer Freedom Risk Retention Group, which pooled hospital money to offset malpractice claims. Bransfield found \u201cextra pockets of cash\u201d on Mountaineer\u2019s balance sheet, according to the confidential investigative report.\n\nHe \u201cfelt he should be able to have access to that money,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn December 2014, Bransfield created the Bishop\u2019s Fund. The stated purpose of the charity was \u201cto provide for the pastoral care of the diocese\u201d and \u201ccharitable care of the people of the diocese,\u201d tax filings show.\n\nChurch investigators later concluded that the fund was a \u201cvehicle for Bransfield to access [Mountaineer] money and spend on projects of his choosing,\u201d according to their report.\n\nThe financial transfers from the hospital began in 2015. They involved multiple steps and were carried out with help from hospital administrators, Bransfield aides and allies on the boards of multiple nonprofit groups.\n\nAD\n\nThe first step involved the closure of Mountaineer Freedom Risk and the creation of a new self-insurance entity. During the changeover, hospital officials carved out $8 million from Mountaineer and gave it to another hospital subsidiary, a charitable group called the Medical Park Foundation, hospital audits show.\n\nIn state incorporation filings, Medical Park said it existed to raise contributions for the benefit of Wheeling Hospital and the \u201csick, injured, disabled, infirm, aged and poor\u201d in the community.\n\nMedical Park, run by several hospital executives and board members, transferred the $8 million to the Bishop\u2019s Fund, according to state records and tax filings.\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, the hospital gave another $13 million to the Bishop\u2019s Fund, some directly and some through Medical Park, tax filings show.\n\nHospital officials referred questions about those transfers, including whether the board had approved them, to an outside lawyer, David Paragas.\n\nParagas initially agreed to answer questions but later sent an email saying the hospital would not do so. \u201cAt this stage, it would be inappropriate for Wheeling Hospital to comment,\u201d Paragas wrote.\n\nIn the interview with The Post, Minor said he had no knowledge of how the transfers from the hospital came about. The next day, he wrote in an email that he had checked with a hospital attorney and was told that the hospital board had approved the transfers.\n\n\u201cThe board acted on the advice of independent counsel for the hospital, the transactions were reviewed by independent counsel for the hospital, and the transfers were approved by the board,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe declined to provide minutes documenting those votes and said he had no further comment.\n\nPalmer and Polinsky, who served together on the hospital board for a decade, said they would have recalled votes for such large transfers.\n\n\u201cIt would be unusual and eye-catching at a meeting to say, \u2018We\u2019re going to take this amount of money and send it to an open fund that the bishop would have,\u2019 \u201d said Polinsky, who served on the board until late last year. \u201cI have no recollection of anything like a Bishop\u2019s Fund.\u201d\n\nPalmer said she was never told about the Bishop\u2019s Fund. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any approval, or even that it was brought up,\u201d she said.\n\nThe lay investigators who prepared the confidential report about Bransfield wrote that they also found no indication the hospital board approved the transfers. Their work included an interview with the hospital president, Msgr. Kevin Quirk, who was also on the board of the Bishop\u2019s Fund and served as a top aide to Bransfield in the diocese. He did not respond to messages seeking comment for this story.\n\n\u201cWe found no evidence that the Board of the Hospital was consulted or approved the establishment and funding of The Bishop\u2019s Fund,\u201d the investigative report said.\n\nMsgr. Frederick Annie, who served on the hospital board, \u201crolled his eyes\u201d when investigators asked about the board\u2019s oversight role, \u201csuggesting an absence of any meaningful review,\u201d the confidential investigative report said.\n\nFunding a legacy\n\nThough few parishioners knew about the Bishop\u2019s Fund, most of the group\u2019s money made its way to projects and initiatives across the state. Among the beneficiaries were select Catholic schools and churches in West Virginia, tax and church records show. In local news accounts, the recipients were often quoted praising Bransfield personally for his generosity.\n\n\n\nThe largest amount by far went to a financially troubled Catholic university in Wheeling that had no formal affiliation with the diocese. Wheeling Jesuit University had asked Bransfield for financial assistance because it was buckling under massive debt and declining revenue.\n\nBransfield, nearing retirement, saw a chance to expand the diocese\u2019s real estate holdings and add luster to his reputation, according to Mark Phillips, then the chief of staff at Wheeling Jesuit, who regularly met with Bransfield to discuss the school\u2019s fate.\n\n\u201cBransfield was very concerned about his legacy,\u201d Phillips wrote to The Post. \u201cHe clearly saw the investments in the Diocese, Wheeling Hospital, and the University as his personal gifts to West Virginia.\u201d\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, the Bishop\u2019s Fund gave a total of $12.6 million to the university to help keep it afloat. In exchange, the diocese gained control of the university and its campus near the Ohio River. The school, now known as Wheeling University, continues to struggle financially.\n\nBishop\u2019s Fund grants helped pay for a new air conditioning system at the gymnasium of Wheeling Central Catholic High School. School President Lawrence Bandi, who at the time served on the board of the Bishop\u2019s Fund, renamed the facility after Bransfield.\n\n\u201cThis was a great opportunity to acknowledge the generosity of the bishop,\u201d Bandi said at the unveiling. Bandi did not respond to phone calls seeking comment. The high school stripped Bransfield\u2019s name from the gym earlier this year.\n\nThe Bishop\u2019s Fund also spent $400,000 on a custom-made Italian altar set that was rejected last fall by parishioners at a church in Wheeling who objected to Bransfield\u2019s lavish spending. The altar now sits in a storage facility, a diocese spokesman said.\n\nBransfield also wanted to use the Bishop\u2019s Fund to send donations and cash gifts outside of West Virginia, according to the investigative report. But there was a problem. The charity had reported to the Internal Revenue Service that its efforts were exclusively devoted to helping people in West Virginia.\n\n\n\nBransfield and his aides decided they could avoid that impediment by using the diocese as a \u201cpass-through,\u201d Minor said.\n\n\u201cI thought that was legal and, according to accounting, that we could make a grant to the diocese and that the diocese could make a grant as a pass-through to a Catholic entity,\u201d Minor said during the interview at his home.\n\nMinor provided The Post with a Bishop\u2019s Fund document listing grants made by the group totaling $17 million. The money given to the diocese and sent out of West Virginia \u2014 including money for Farrell\u2019s apartment \u2014 was described only as supporting \u201coperations.\u201d\n\nThe Post determined that some $60,000 of that was donated through the diocese to the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in the District, where Bransfield had worked as a finance director and rector. The donation was used to help renovate the church\u2019s iconic dome, according to a spokesman for the National Shrine.\n\nDisbursements related to the two gifts for Farrell\u2019s apartment in Rome account for another $54,000.\n\nFarrell was one of more than 130 clergymen, including more than a dozen cardinals, who received cash gifts totaling $350,000 from Bransfield during his time in West Virginia, The Post previously reported. Most of those gifts predate the creation of the Bishop\u2019s Fund.\n\nBransfield wrote the checks from his personal account. The West Virginia diocese reimbursed him by boosting his compensation to cover both the value of the gifts and the taxes he would owe on the added compensation, church investigators found.\n\nAs a tax-exempt organization, the diocese is supposed to use its money only for charitable purposes and may not excessively enrich any individual, according to IRS rules.\n\nIn addition to the $29,000 that went to Farrell, the diocese paid Bransfield $25,000 to cover the income taxes Bransfield would owe, drawing all of the money from the Bishop\u2019s Fund, according to church documents and interviews with Minor and Bransfield.\n\nMultiple emails among diocese leaders directly link the money from the Bishop\u2019s Fund to the Farrell gifts.\n\n\u201cHey there. Just a note that I need to order a check from The Bishop\u2019s Fund, payable to DWC, to cover a check as a gift to Abp Kevin Farrell at the Vatican,\u201d Minor wrote on May 12, 2017.\n\nIn statements to The Post earlier this year, Farrell and more than a dozen other recipients of Bransfield\u2019s gifts said they had presumed the money was the bishop\u2019s. Farrell and the others pledged to repay the diocese.\n\nA Vatican spokesman confirmed this month that Farrell had done so.\n\nFarrell is a close adviser to the pope and an influential figure in the church. He and Bransfield became friends in the 1980s and 1990s, when both held church posts in Washington.\n\n\n\nThe men had the same mentor, former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, a legendary fundraiser for the church who was defrocked after the church found him guilty of sexual abuse. Bransfield and Farrell also served together on the influential Papal Foundation, a charity that raises money from wealthy American Catholics for initiatives chosen by the pope.\n\nThe gifts to Farrell and other clerics were cited in a letter by Quirk, Bransfield\u2019s aide, as an example of his alleged misconduct.\n\nQuirk\u2019s August 2018 letter to Baltimore Archbishop William Lori, obtained by The Post, accused Bransfield of trying to buy influence in the church. Quirk wrote that Bransfield was seeking help from Farrell to arrange a one-on-one visit with the pope last fall.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is my own opinion that His Excellency makes use of monetary gifts, such as those noted above, to higher ranking ecclesiastics and gifts to subordinates to purchase influence from the former and compliance or loyalty from the latter,\u201d Quirk wrote.\n\nBransfield denied Quirk\u2019s allegation. \u201cI didn\u2019t do these things for people to give me something,\u201d he told The Post in July.\n\nLori, as acting administrator of the diocese, announced in July that he was shutting down the Bishop\u2019s Fund as part of a package of reforms to improve financial oversight in the wake of The Post\u2019s revelations about Bransfield\u2019s conduct. Lori did not detail the concerns about the charity or describe its financial link to the hospital.\n\n\u201cWhen a bishop is entrusted to care for a diocese, he is expected to be a wise and honest steward of its resources,\u201d Lori wrote in an open letter to Catholics. \u201cBut here in Wheeling-Charleston, these procedures and policies did not prevent the bishop from misusing diocesan funds.\u201d\n\nA spokesman said the $4 million remaining in the charity coffers would be transferred to the diocese.\n\n'It is my hospital'\n\nThe Justice Department lawsuit against Wheeling Hospital, based on a whistleblower\u2019s claim, was unsealed in March and is still in its early stages. It alleged that the hospital and its then-leader, Ronald Violi \u2014 named as a defendant and described in court records as Bransfield\u2019s \u201chand-picked\u201d chief executive \u2014 were responsible for thousands of false claims for reimbursement from the federal health-care program for the elderly.\n\nJustice said that the hospital\u2019s financial turnaround was driven in part by the alleged scheme.\n\nThe lawsuit said the executives \u201creported to and took direction from Bishop Bransfield,\u201d who personally maintained control over hospital operations and set the pay of the chief executive.\n\n\u201cIt is my hospital,\u201d Bransfield often said, Violi told Justice Department lawyers in a recent deposition.\n\n\n\nBransfield was not named as a defendant.\n\nThe hospital has described the allegations as \u201can unfair attack\u201d on its values and physicians.\n\n\n\nVioli stepped down as chief executive earlier this year. He has denied wrongdoing. His attorney did not respond to requests seeking comment for this story.\n\nIn a filing this month, Justice Department lawyers sought information about Violi\u2019s relationship with Bransfield and about the transfers to the Bishop\u2019s Fund.\n\nThey alleged that Bransfield increased Violi\u2019s compensation at the same time the hospital was directing \u201ca large amount of its (allegedly ill-gotten) profits towards the Diocese and the now-dissolved Bishop\u2019s Fund.\u201d", "description": "The untold story behind the cash gift from Bishop Michael Bransfield adds a new dimension to a financial scandal in the Catholic Church.", "authors": ["Robert O'Harrow Jr.", "Investigative Reporter Covering The Trump Administration", "Technology", "Shawn Boburg", "Investigative Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7qYnVwsv_36_C4fJNNqzy0mwc30=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XQGUCWHYJ4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
