(Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nWashington Mystics Coach Mike Thibault gave a speech to his players this week about cutting out distractions, because he knows what happens when the WNBA Finals get rolling: Social media chatter picks up, friends start texting suggestions, and family members trickle into town.\n\n\u201cEverybody has ideas,\u201d Thibault said.\n\nCenter LaToya Sanders understood the message. But to her, family isn\u2019t a distraction to be shut out, especially in pressure situations such as the one the Mystics are staring down. On Saturday, Washington will travel to Connecticut for Sunday\u2019s Game 3 of the WNBA Finals, with the best-of-five series tied at a game apiece.\n\n[No one has more WNBA victories than Mike Thibault. He needs two more for his first title.]\n\nSanders leads the Mystics defense along with guard Natasha Cloud, who holds things down on the perimeter while the 6-foot-2 center patrols the post. Washington has been drilling down on defense all week since its Game 2 loss \u2014 it\u2019ll be the crucial factor against the Sun with Elena Delle Donne\u2019s status unknown due to a herniated disk in her back. Thibault said the team will give an injury update on Delle Donne on Saturday.\n\nWhat\u2019s certain is that Sanders will have to be at her best. Which means she\u2019ll be thinking of her family before the game.\n\n\u201cI really play mostly for them,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nA winding path brought Sanders, 33, to the Mystics. Drafted by Phoenix in 2008, she also played for Minnesota and Los Angeles before taking leave from the WNBA in 2011 so she could spend time with her terminally ill father, Reece Pringle, who died of cancer in 2012. She didn\u2019t return to the WNBA until 2015, opting to stay home for at least part of the year so she could keep an eye on her mother and sister, though she did play abroad in Turkey during that time, competing both on a professional club and with the national team. (Sanders became a naturalized Turkish citizen in 2012.)\n\nThe decision to come back to the WNBA wasn\u2019t one Sanders took lightly. It helped that. by the time she was considering a comeback. Washington owned her rights, so at least if she chose to play she would be relatively close to home \u2014 about a four-hour drive away from where her mother, Sharon, lives. Feelings of guilt about missing time with her family mingled with the desire to end a career on her own terms. Ultimately, she didn\u2019t have to choose one over the other.\n\n\u201cI kind of felt guilty missing so much of my dad\u2019s life later on and then not being around my mom and sister,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut I know they love to see me play in the WNBA. My mom and sister and grandmother, at the time, could all see me play [in Washington], so I\u2019d actually say I came back for them. Coach T was gracious enough to ask me to come back.\"\n\nThe reputation of Thibault as a players\u2019 coach and the presence of Ivory Latta, Sanders\u2019s college teammate from North Carolina, on the Mystics made Sanders comfortable with restarting her domestic basketball career with Washington.\n\nThibault liked her defense enough to make her the first sub off the bench in her first game with Washington, despite the fact that she didn\u2019t know any plays. That laid a foundation of trust that has continued into this season \u2014 Thibault often lets Sanders stand aside during drills in practice because she picks up plays and strategy so quickly.\n\nSince then, Sanders has become a key part of the Mystics defense. She was second on the team behind Delle Donne in rebounding during the regular season, averaging 5.5 per game. In the playoffs, her rebounds have dipped slightly, to 4.3 per game, in part because she takes the hardest defensive assignment. In these playoffs that has meant taking on two bruising interior stars, 6-foot-8 Liz Cambage of Las Vegas and 6-6 Jonquel Jones of Connecticut.\n\nBeyond her stats, Sanders is what Cloud and Thibault call Washington's glue player.\n\n\u201cToya does stuff that doesn\u2019t come up on the stat sheet, all the little things,\u201d guard Shatori Walker-Kimbrough said. \u201cShe\u2019s battling some injuries; she could have sat down a long time ago if she wanted to. But you see her giving it her all. I mean she\u2019s battling Liz Cambage all series, diving all over the floor. And when we see her, at that age \u2014 not saying she\u2019s old \u2014 but when we see that, that brings us together and brings us energy. She\u2019s one of those people who doesn\u2019t say much, but when she does we all lock in, because she\u2019s a vet.\"\n\nSanders has played the entire season with a torn labrum in her hip that will eventually require surgery, though probably not until she retires. The pain isn\u2019t as bad when she\u2019s playing as it is when she\u2019s going about daily life, so she has refused to miss games.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a change for someone who was ready to be done with the WNBA just a few years ago.\n\n\u201cIt took me a while to find my role and my importance and what I can bring to a team. It took me being comfortable in Coach T\u2019s system to realize, you know, I\u2019m pretty good,\u201d Sanders said with a laugh. \u201cSometimes you have to go until you find a place that fits you, and maybe I didn\u2019t necessarily fit in in Phoenix and L.A. But five years later, and I\u2019m still here, with more years to come.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nWith Delle Donne\u2019s status in doubt, Mystics vow to be more physical on defense\n\nKevin B.
