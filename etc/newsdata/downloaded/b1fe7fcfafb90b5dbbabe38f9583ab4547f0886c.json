The so-called transcript of his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelevsky released last week \u2014 really a collection of notes \u2014 was already damning evidence of the president manipulating foreign policy for his personal political goals. Then the actual whistleblower complaint reconfirmed and solidified the case. Trump\u2019s White House counsel, Donald McGahn, even wrote a memo cautioning him that using law enforcement powers to target a political adversary would be illegal and clearly impeachable.\n\nBut if Democrats are going to uncover more information through aggressive hearings and ultimately impeach the president, they need to recognize their most powerful adversary: Attorney General William Barr.\n\nBarr has not just failed in his duty to carry out and enforce the law as attorney general. He has also used the power of his office to go after Trump\u2019s enemies. We now know that he has served as a leading \u201cdiplomat\u201d for a sort of shadow \u201cthe president is the state\u201d foreign policy, conducted with at least the United Kingdom, Italy, and Australia.
