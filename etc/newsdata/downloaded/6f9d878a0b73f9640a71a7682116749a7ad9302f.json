Not all of those who are affected have been removed and those who were not actually dishonest were demoralised and many of them left the service and you have lack of integrity and professional capacity at those levels.\n\n\"The poison lingers on... we are all upset that we have seen no easy matted cases. We want to see people in orange [prison] uniforms. We are angry.\"\n\nThe commission of inquiry into state capture, which is currently under way, is investigating allegations of undue influence by the politically connected Gupta family on Zuma and at state-owned enterprises.\n\nZuma previously admitted that he was friends with the Guptas.\n\nSince the start of the commission, inquiry chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has heard some startling testimony.\n\nSome have even suggested that the scope of the inquiry should be extend to include all arms of the state.\n\n", "description": "Retired Constitutional Court Justice Johann Kriegler says it is dangerous to view state capture as something which only relates to former president Jacob Zuma and his relationship with the controversial Gupta family.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9509/0d9bf24055754102b58adca79a0779f7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
