You run into your constituents every single day.\"\n\nOn Thursday Extinction Rebellion attempted to shut down London City Airport, with one protester lying on top of a plane. On Friday they blocked the headquarters of the BBC, the public service broadcaster in the United Kingdom.\n\n'We want to see action'\n\nEarlier this week, members of the movement in France blocked a street and bridge in Paris' Chatelet district. The city's mayor and C40 chair, Anne Hidalgo, said she shared their concern.\n\n\"We are facing threats of climate breakdown \u2013 the response that we're seeing from Extinction Rebellion and young climate strikers around the globe should come as no surprise,\" she said.\n\n\"As mayors, it is our duty, responsibility and privilege to support them in creating the future they want.\"\n\nIn Copenhagen, city leaders unveiled a series of pledges and measures to cut planet-warming emissions, from reducing meat consumption to tackling air pollution with cheap bus fares and vehicle bans.\n\nBut delegates at the summit opening on Wednesday were met by demonstrators from Klima Aktion DK, a local climate action group, armed with fake binoculars made from toilet rolls.\n\n\"Our message to the C40 Mayors is: The people are watching you! We want to see action!\" the group wrote on Facebook.\n\nCities are vital to limit global warming as they account for about three-quarters of carbon emissions and consume more than two-thirds of global energy, according to the United Nations.\n\nWider use of existing clean technologies - such as electric buses - could deliver more than half the cuts needed to keep global temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the UN says.\n\nWorld leaders agreed in the 2015 Paris agreement to hold temperate hikes to \"well below\" that threshold.\n\n\"Cities are where the climate battle will largely be won or lost,\" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Copenhagen summit.\n\n'Feel the same heat'\n\nHilda Nakabuye, the founder of Fridays for Future in Uganda, said her family had been forced to sell its land and livestock as heavy rains, high winds and dry spells linked to climate change had wiped away crops and made the soil barren.\n\n\"Your beds might be comfortable right now but not for long. You'll soon feel the same heat that we feel every day,\" she warned.\n\nMany mayors in attendance said they were inspired by the resolve shown by young activists - and somewhat surprised by the rapid growth of their movement.\n\nMilan's mayor Giuseppe Sala said the city council was planning to consult young people in climate matters. But translating ideas into concrete action was not always easy, as not everybody agreed on what should be done, said the mayor of Lisbon, Fernando Medina.\n\nEven simple measures such as creating more cycle lanes often faced opposition from residents and politicians when, for example, they encroached on parking spaces, he said.\n\n\"I don't have a magic wand,\" he said. \"But I can tell [young people] that I can work every day to make things happen more quickly\".\n\nOthers lamented that cities alone could not solve the climate crisis. \"Cities are leading the change, but countries need to do their part too,\" said the mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau.\n\nAt least 70 countries announced plans at the UN Climate Action Summit last month to boost efforts to cut emissions, but most major economies, including the United States and China, failed to announce stronger new measures.", "description": "City governments commit to work with young activists on implementing policies that cut carbon emissions more quickly.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/11/c17dd30ea6774f2eb91b058597d139a3_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
