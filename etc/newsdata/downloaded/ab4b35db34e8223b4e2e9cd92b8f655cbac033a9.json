But talks have been sluggish and the EU is skeptical about whether the British government can come up with a solution that doesn\u2019t breach the bloc\u2019s red lines and that can get U.K. parliament approval.\n\nThe government wants to replace the backstop -- which the EU says is necessary to protect peace on the island of Ireland -- with new measures that avoid the U.K. staying in a customs union with the bloc. But with only six weeks to go, the government hasn\u2019t put forward any formal proposals, EU officials said.\n\n\u201cI called on the prime minister to come forward with operational proposals in writing,\u201d Juncker said. \u201cUntil such time as those proposals are presented, I will not be able to tell you, looking you straight in the eye, that any real progress has been achieved.\u201d\n\nPound Falls\n\nA British official said on Tuesday the government is sounding out the bloc on its ideas for the Irish border before submitting its plans in written form.\n\nThe pound dipped after Juncker\u2019s comments, dropping 0.3% to $1.2467. It has staged a small recovery this month as the U.K. parliament and the British courts push back on Johnson\u2019s efforts to crash out of the EU in October whether an agreement has been reached or not.\n\nJohnson\u2019s officials have indicated he will defy a new law designed to force him to seek a delay to Brexit rather than allow a no-deal split next month. The EU has signaled that it will be open to postponing the U.K.\u2019s departure date rather than see a no-deal crash-out.\n\nThe talks with Johnson in Luxembourg were \u201cfriendly, constructive and, in part, positive,\u201d Juncker said, but added that the prospect of the U.K. leaving the bloc without an agreement to soften the economic blow \u201cremains real.\u201d\n\nWhile there aren\u2019t any written proposals for alternatives to the backstop, the two sides have been talking about possibilities. The U.K. has suggested an all-Ireland agri-food zone, that would eliminate the need for checks. But the EU says this doesn\u2019t go far enough to replace the backstop and insists the government must come up with more ideas.\n\n(Updates with British comment in the sixth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from John Ainger.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jonathan Stearns in Strasbourg, France at jstearns2@bloomberg.net;Ian Wishart in Brussels at iwishart@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Sills at bsills@bloomberg.net, Richard Bravo, Stuart Biggs\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Wednesday that the risk of a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31 is now \u201cpalpable,\u201d sparking a drop in the pound.Juncker, speaking to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, after a meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on", "authors": ["Jonathan Stearns", "Ian Wishart"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7yBE1Y5ZMtfjYC_dY9XUMg--~B/aD0xMzM1O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/6a4b551be542335c6be3042c993e358f", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
