She holds a coffee. She stands with her hand on her popped hip.\n\nIn her world, the experiences of women, and their broad contributions to society, form the basis of the board game.\n\n\n\n\u201cMs. Monopoly\u201d incorporates the gender pay gap into the classic board game. According to Hasbro, it's the first game \u201cwhere women make more than men.\u201d (Hasbro)\n\nThe banker gives $1,900 in Monopoly money to female players and $1,500 to each male, reported USA Today. When players pass go, women again get the upper hand \u2014 receiving $240 to the men\u2019s $200. Investments in real estate from the original game have been replaced by investments in innovations made by women, such as bulletproof vests, WiFi, chocolate chip cookies and ladies\u2019 modern shapewear.\n\nAlong the way, players can pick up tokens, such as a barbell, a glass or a jet plane. The watch token symbolizes that it is \u201cabout time for some changes,\u201d Jen Boswinkel, senior director of global brand strategy and marketing for Hasbro Gaming, told USA Today.\n\nThe white top-hat token is meant to represent Mr. Monopoly passing the hat to his niece.\n\n\u201cWith all of the things surrounding female empowerment, it felt right to bring this to Monopoly in a fresh new way,\u201d Boswinkel said. \u201cIt\u2019s giving the topic some relevancy to everyone playing it that everybody gets a turn, and this time women get an advantage at the start.\u201d\n\nMs. Monopoly\u2019s premise is a not-so-subtle nod to the gender imbalances in modern workplaces, including pay inequality, and the ways that women\u2019s experiences and contributions have often been played down \u2014 or erased altogether \u2014 from history.\n\n\n\nIn \u201cMs. Monopoly,\u201d female players start out with $1,900 and male players with $1,500, a nod to the gender pay gap. (Hasbro)\n\nThe game does two things, Boswinkel told USA Today. It illuminates inventions, innovations and products that families probably use but perhaps don\u2019t know were invented by women. It also provides a fun framework for a nuanced issue that, Hasbro hopes, will prompt discussions about structural discrimination during family game night.\n\nIn a statement about the game launch, Hasbro called the pay imbalance \u201ca fun spin\u201d that \u201ccreates a world where women have an advantage often enjoyed by men.\u201d\n\nEven still, male players \u2014 the game pieces, not the humans manipulating them \u2014 can still win, even with the monetary disadvantage. And, Boswinkel told USA Today, families can opt to take the money talk out of Ms. Monopoly by doling out equal amounts of cash, regardless of the player\u2019s gender.\n\nThe rollout of Ms. Monopoly, which can be preordered at Walmart starting Sept. 10, comes after the launches of two other recent spinoffs, Monopoly: Socialism and Monopoly for Millennials.\n\nIn marketing the game, Hasbro made a short video advertisement featuring three young female inventors talking about gendered stereotypes around technological and scientific achievements. In the short film, the three girls receive $20,580 in real \u2014 not Monopoly \u2014 money to fund their own innovative projects.\n\nSophia Wang, 16, of Connecticut invented a device that is 93 percent accurate in detecting sinkholes before they happen. Ava Canney, also 16 and from Ireland, created a spectrometer that measures artificial dye in candy and soda. In Denver, 13-year-old Gitanjali Rao\u2019s invention involves detecting lead in drinking water in an accessible, portable, inexpensive way.\n\nRead more:\n\nPerspective | Why the gender pay gap persists (and what we can do about it)\n\nWhen will the gender pay gap close?
