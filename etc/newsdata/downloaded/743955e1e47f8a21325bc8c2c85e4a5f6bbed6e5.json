That all helped me a lot to get to where I am now. I played a lot of rugby, got a lot of starts. The head coach, Steve Diamond, backed me continuously.\"\n\nThe defensive structure of the Boks has been one of their standout features in Japan, highlighted by a massive defensive effort against the hosts in the quarter-final.\n\nDe Klerk earned many plaudits for his defensive effort in that match.\n\n\"It might look a bit role-less, but there is a bit of a role going on there,\" he said.\n\n\"It\u2019s not just willy-nilly and running around. I need to fill certain spaces, and make sure we are covered on both sides of the ruck, and make sure the numbers are right.\n\n\"As nines in our system, we need to make sure we come off the line and our numbers are correct on both sides.\n\n\"I try to do well for the team and create a turnover, and that\u2019s one great thing about this team \u2013 everybody is up for it. We saw this past week the boys were nice and physical, and we\u2019ve been speaking a lot about that\n\n\"The boys really pitched up. Hopefully they will just get better and better, and take it forward.\"\n\nThe Boks will name their side for Sunday's semi-final on Thursday, and kick-off will be at 11:00 (SA time).\n\n- Compiled by Lloyd Burnard", "description": "Springbok scrumhalf Faf de Klerk has paid tribute to his club Sale Sharks for helping develop his game.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7808/0bc1df482a644cf192ddd2453e54e5a9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
