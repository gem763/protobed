It doesn\u2019t matter who plays quarterback. It doesn\u2019t matter who coaches. Nothing matters as long as Dan Snyder owns the team.\u201d\n\nHow about starting today, with the stories that coach Jay Gruden, after an 0-5 start to the season (35-49-1 overall) was fired Monday morning? Does it really matter? Will nothing short of a three-hour tour by Snyder on his yacht change anything, no matter who is the coach?\n\nThe answer is no, and to believe otherwise may be dangerous to your health.\n\nThe truth is that if you were truly judging Gruden\u2019s ability as a coach, you would have fired him at the end of the 2016 season, when, with a record of 8-7-1 and a chance to make the postseason for the second straight year, his team lost 19-10 to a New York Giants squad that had already locked up a playoff spot and had nothing to play for.\n\nAll the ills that have consistently defined Gruden\u2019s tenure as the Redskins coach \u2014 the sloppiness, the lack of discipline, the inability to prepare a team to play in a big game \u2014 all that was in evidence in a must-win game against a sparring partner of an opponent.\n\nIt was the end of Year 3 under Gruden, and we were hearing too many times from the coach himself that he was being outcoached in losses, such as their 26-15 loss to Carolina weeks earlier, when he said, \u201cWe were outcoached today.\u201d He did the same thing after the Giants loss, telling reporters, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do a better job as coaches.\u201d\n\nI might point out that he was outcoached that day by Ben McAdoo \u2014 who was out of a job a year later.\n\nWe heard it too many times after games throughout Gruden\u2019s time in Washington. His media buddies \u2014 and Gruden had many \u2014 might say this is coachspeak to protect his players. But it was the continuous drum that Gruden himself beat. And he was right. He was often outcoached.\n\nHe may be a great play caller. He may be a smart offensive coordinator. I say these things because so many Gruden media supporters have said it, so it must be true. But this from former Philadelphia Eagles president Joe Banner on Twitter may be closer to the truth: \u201cThe Skins organization is awful and I have been very critical of it, but media people giving Jay Gruden a semi/pass are not doing anything but defending a friend. He has also not been good.\u201d\n\nGruden was easy to like. He treated reporters with respect, rarely losing his cool. But he may be Norv Turner \u2014 a likeable media favorite and good offensive coordinator who was unable to be the firm, visionary leader on the field to guide a team to consistent winning.\n\nThen again, it wouldn\u2019t matter if he was that kind of coach. It won\u2019t matter if the next coach is that kind of coach. It just doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nIn case Redskins fans need convincing of that, all they had to do was listen to the Prince of Darkness\u2019 news conference Monday from Redskins Park, an exercise that reminded everyone there are worse things than watching this team play football.\n\nTeam president Bruce Allen was at his arrogant, delusional worst, declaring that their Politburo culture is \u201cdamn good.\u201d He also claimed there are \u201cmillions of Redskins fans,\u201d ignoring the fact that few of them watch the team on television and even fewer pay money to see them in person.\n\nAsked about the Patriots fans that filled Ghost Town Field Sunday, Allen put the blame on fans selling their tickets on the secondary market \u2014 one of the very things that former chief operating officer Brian Lafemina and his team of business executives were trying to stop to repair the damaged attendance. Then again, Allen undermined Lafemina and drove him and his crew from the building eight months after they arrived.\n\nI wonder what Allen\u2019s father, former Redskins coach and Hall of Famer George Allen, would think of his son these days. Since he was hired as general manager, the team has a record of 59-89-1. Monday, the Prince of Darkness claimed he would not \u201chide\u201d from that record.\n\nHis father might say, \u201cSon, maybe you should.\u201d\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday and Sunday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
