(Oct. 8) AP, AP\n\nTurkey was on the brink Wednesday of launching an offensive into Kurdish-controlled parts of Syria, a senior Turkish official said, in a move that would defy international criticism and comes just days after President Donald Trump announced U.S. troops supporting Kurdish forces in the area would be pulled back from the border zone.\n\nFahrettin Altun, the Turkish government's chief spokesman, tweeted that the \"Turkish military, together with the Free Syrian Army, will cross the Turkish-Syrian border shortly.\"\n\nAltun's tweet Wednesday linked to an op-ed in The Washington Post, in which he wrote that Turkey seeks to \"neutralize\" Syrian Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria and to \"liberate the local population from the yoke of the armed thugs.\"\n\n'A reckless gamble': Four reasons critics decry Trump's 'impulsive' Syria withdrawal\n\nSyria's Kurds have partnered with U.S.-led coalition forces in northeastern Syria fighting the Islamic State group for nearly four years.
