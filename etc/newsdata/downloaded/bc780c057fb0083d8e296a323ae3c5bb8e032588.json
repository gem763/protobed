Especially confidence walking into clothes shops.\n\nIf you were brought up in the Seventies, you\u2019ll remember what a terrifying prospect that could be.\n\nThe dismissive assistant, seemingly intent on not making a sale: that is such a trope of my Seventies past.\n\nFemail columnist Christa D'Souza says it's time we called out those day-to-day moments when we're patronised for not being younger\n\nIf there is a trope of today, it\u2019s got to be the over-zealous sales assistant whose life depends on getting you into the changing room with at least ten items.\n\nSo I was surprised when, although the only customer in my favourite shop last week, I was entirely ignored.\n\nWhich would have been fine if the place had been jammed and I didn\u2019t need help. But it wasn\u2019t and I did.\n\nEventually I caught the attention of a young man.
