And we would have gone on the record to say that if the [Post] had given us more than 6 minutes (literally) to respond.\u201d Trump also knocked the report, saying Wednesday in a news conference, \u201cThe Amazon Washington Post just put out a fake article that [Maguire] was going to quit.\u201d\n\nA member of the intelligence community had submitted the complaint to warn officials that President Donald Trump may have violated campaign finance law in talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe Trump administration initially responded to the whirlwind of reports by shielding the complaint \u2015 said to focus on a call between Trump and Zelensky \u2015 from members of Congress. But its strategy began to crumble this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, the summary of a July 25 call between the leaders produced by the White House confirmed the president had asked Zelensky to \u201cdo us a favor, though.\u201d Trump said Zelensky should open an investigation into Joe Biden, the political foe Trump sees as his biggest threat in the 2020 election, and also investigate a conspiracy theory related to the 2016 hack of Democratic National Committee servers by Russia.\n\nHe appeared to link the offer of U.S. military aid to Ukraine to the requests, having asked for \u201ca favor\u201d directly after Zelensky spoke about needing more anti-tank missiles.\n\nContents of the White House\u2019s summary left even some Republicans on the hill with serious concerns.\n\nYet Trump and his personal attorney, the former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, have vehemently denied any wrongdoing. Giuliani was drawn straight into the melee himself, along with Attorney General William Barr, when Trump told Zelensky to speak with both men about the requested favors.\n\nAs House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced a formal impeachment inquiry on Trump Tuesday, she also issued a clear directive to Maguire, demanding that he turn over the full whistleblower complaint to congressional intelligence committees.\n\n\u201cHe will have to choose whether to break the law or honor his responsibility to the Constitution,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nMaguire previously asserted in a statement that he was \u201ccommitted to protecting whistleblowers and ensuring every complaint is handled appropriately.\u201d", "description": "Joseph Maguire disputes the report as he prepares to testify before Congress about a damning whistleblower complaint.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8bb7c622000031005154ec.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
