Regulators have ramped up scrutiny on the sector amid concerns over the quality of audits provided by U.K. audit firms following several high-profile corporate collapses. Regulators and lawmakers are concerned that conflicts of interest could arise if an audit firm sells nonaudit services to its audit clients. U.K. regulators, including the Competition and Markets Authority, in recent months have proposed an operational split between accounting firms\u2019 audit and consulting business. Meanwhile, a parliamentary committee is suggesting new legislation that would introduce a structural separation between audit and consulting businesses. Newsletter Sign-up The U.K. government has yet to respond to the recommendations. Deloitte, Ernst & Young, PwC and KPMG didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. KPMG recently confirmed it would move about 750 U.K. employees from its advisory business to its audit division in preparation for potential regulatory changes. PwC in September said it is considering changes to how its U.K. partners are being remunerated to avoid potential conflicts of interest.
