Maybe Velasquez, maybe Lesnar.\"\n\n(Image: WWE/Youtube)\n\nFury's stature in America rose considerably when he rose from the canvas to achieve a stunning draw against WBC champion Wilder last December, and the pair are set for a rematch next year.\n\nBut first, the Manchester-born boxer will achieve a dream later this month when he steps into the wrestling ring.\n\n\"I'd like to take this opportunity to say how honoured I am to be here and involved,\" Fury said at the press conference.\n\n\"This is something I've always dreamed of, I'm a lifelong WWE fan and this is a fantastic opportunity for me.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"I'd like to say how excited I am to be fighting the monster among men Braun Strowman. But me, being the undefeated lineal boxing champion, I fear no one.\n\n\"When I go to Saudi, I am still going to be undefeated, I am going to knock Braun Strowman out.\n\n\"He is messing with a guy with the best hands in boxing. He don't want none of them hands.\"\n\nUndefeated Fury is still recovering from an eye injury that he suffered in his battling victory over relative unknown Otto Wallin in Las Vegas last month, which required around 50 stitches.", "description": "Tyson Fury has made a foray into the world of professional wrestling that will culminate in a fight against Braun Strowman", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Pa", "Wwe Youtube"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20068631.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Tyson-Fury-File-Photo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
