She has been on record\u2014to the press, to writer-director Lorene Scafaria, to Jennifer Lopez\u2014that she would have cleaned the set or stock meals at craft services if it meant she got to be a part of the film, although she admits that she doesn\u2019t think \u201canyone can compete with what [Lopez] does in this movie.\u201d\n\nStiles, who has spent two decades as a major Hollywood presence, since her breakout turn in 1999\u2019s 10 Things I Hate About You, can\u2019t remember the last time she sought out and actively pursued a project, like she did with this.\n\nShe had read the New York magazine article by Jessica Pressler, \u201cThe Hustlers at Scores,\u201d that the film is based on, and started following Pressler\u2019s work. \u201cI was obsessed with that Anna Delvey story she wrote,\u201d she says, referring to the now-iconic feature on a fake heiress who scammed her way through New York\u2019s haut monde. Our conversation is nearly derailed gushing over Pressler\u2019s recent yarn about a class riot among the 1 percent when Brooklyn\u2019s oldest nursery school tried to modernize.\n\nWhen she heard a project based on the hustlers article was in the works, she asked her agents to get her the script. \u201cThey were like, you might really like this but the part\u2019s not that flashy because you\u2019re not playing a dancer,\u201d she says. But she was instantly struck by Scafaria\u2019s take on the story and asked to meet with the director, whose previous film, The Meddler, had a well-received release in 2015. \u201cI spoke to her and I was like, I don\u2019t care if I have to sweep the floors. I\u2019ll do anything to be part of this movie.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re having a late lunch on a scorching day in early August before she has to be home to relieve her babysitter. The family is getting ready for a mini-vacation to visit her parents before their now-annual relocation to Europe, where she shoots the noir thriller series Riviera, which airs on Sky Atlantic in the U.K. and on Ovation stateside. The new season adds Italy and Argentina to the titular shooting location.\n\nStopping herself from detailing the hectic nature of the travel plans, a giddy smile broadens across her face. \u201cI always feel like a jerk when people ask where I\u2019m working,\u201d she laughs. \u201cLike, no big deal: the South of France.\u201d\n\nShe had just snuck into an early Hustlers press screening a few days before, after waffling over whether or not it be weird for her to show up. It would still be a month until the film\u2019s premiere last weekend at the Toronto Film Festival\u2014it officially hits theaters Sept. 13\u2014but she is so glad she went: \u201cI can\u2019t remember being in a movie that I kept thinking about this much afterwards.\u201d\n\nIt turns out that Stiles didn\u2019t have to sweep floors. She plays the role based on Pressler herself: Elizabeth, the journalist who sits down with former strippers Destiny (Constance Wu), Ramona (Lopez), and the detectives who investigated their crimes in order to piece together what exactly these women had done and, more importantly, why.\n\nAfter the Wall Street crash in 2008, dancers at a New York City strip club saw their clients evacuate the Champagne Room en masse, so they devised a plan. The group would go \u201cfishing\u201d together at bars for executives who seem like they still have high limits on their credit cards. They\u2019d drug the men with a combination of MDMA and ketamine\u2014to keep them happy, but passed out\u2014take them back to the club, run up charges on their cards, and take a cut of the profits.\n\nAt first, Elizabeth is judgmental. But the more she talks to the women, the more compassion she has for them.\n\n\u201cThey could have made five different versions of this story,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cIt could have been Striptease. It could have been Showgirls. It could\u2019ve been a true crime story demonizing these women, focusing on the aftermath of what happened to the men they drugged. But Lorene focuses on the sisterhood and the partnership between these women, trying to get us to understand why these women did what they did.\u201d\n\nThe reviews for the film have been ecstatic, with many critics championing it as a stealth Oscar contender\u2014stealth only because of a double standard that would historically see a film about strippers dismissed, even though everything from its themes and tone to its structure is something that would be celebrated if, say, it was a Martin Scorsese movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nWe talk a lot about that double standard over lunch. It\u2019s a conversation that\u2019s been high on Stiles\u2019 mind for practically her entire career. She\u2019s aware of how difficult it was to get Hustlers made for that reason. She\u2019s engaged in conversations about it on the set of Riviera. She had to give up the rights to a long-gestating adaptation of The Bell Jar\u2014which is still wallowing seven years later\u2014because of it, too.\n\nBut that\u2019s why she\u2019s so unabashedly gleeful about Hustlers, and this moment in her career.\n\n\u201cIf you had talked to me two or three years ago, I might have been more nervous or more frustrated, but I\u2019m really, really happy where I am now,\u201d she says.\n\nBefore Riviera came along, she had shot a string of independent films that nobody saw. \u201cI felt like I was sort of jumping from job to job that I wasn\u2019t really connected to, and worried about where my career was going.\u201d\n\n\u201c I think a few years ago my frustration was feeling like nobody knew what to do with me. You know, I had had some success in my twenties and now I\u2019m in a different place in my life and I didn\u2019t really fit anywhere. \u201d\n\n\u201cI think a few years ago my frustration was feeling like nobody knew what to do with me,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, I had had some success in my twenties and now I\u2019m in a different place in my life and I didn\u2019t really fit anywhere.\u201d\n\nThat afforded her the opportunity to direct and do more theater, but she felt lost in her own industry. \u201cBut a movie like Hustlers to me is such an affirmation that like I have a place in the film industry and stories that I\u2019m interested in are being told.\u201d\n\nYou could say that Julia Stiles is having a moment.\n\nShe\u2019s had them before. But what\u2019s rare about this one is that, thanks to the recent blitz of press timed to the 20th anniversary of 10 Things I Hate About You and the (much deserved) fawning over her performance as Kat, the \u201cmoment\u201d is simultaneously rooted in nostalgia for her big break and a celebration of her current work.\n\nFor Stiles, it\u2019s an opportunity to reflect on how she\u2019s grown, the ways she did and didn\u2019t succeed in weathering the industry and fame as an It Girl ing\u00e9nue, and how she\u2019s seen the business evolve in ways that are more amenable to her interests, taste, and values.\n\nA loose adaptation of Shakespeare\u2019s The Taming of the Shrew set in a Seattle high school at the turn of the millennium, 10 Things I Hate About You was a cinematic incubator for future stars, from Gabrielle Union and Joseph Gordon-Levitt to Heath Ledger. But it\u2019s Stiles whose career instantly exploded.\n\nHer Kat was a teenage feminist, a strong-willed and strong-minded heroine whose intelligence and unapologetic opinions never obscured the fact that she was still a high-school girl with big feelings and big emotions. Stiles beat out Kate Hudson and Katie Holmes for the part, owing to her intense chemistry with Ledger and the endearing vulnerability that shone through her buttoned-up strength.\n\nDuring the scene near the end when her character reads the titular poem to Ledger\u2019s character, Stiles started crying, even though it wasn\u2019t scripted. As far as movies chronicling teen angst go, it\u2019s the perfect performance in the perfect scene. It\u2019s no wonder that Stiles would soon be cast in a string of similar roles in films like Save the Last Dance, Hamlet, O, and Mona Lisa Smile.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t take it for granted that people are talking about the movie 20 years later,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cIt\u2019s an affirmation that even back then the things, the stories, and the roles that I was drawn to, other people were interested in as well. That was the first time I really read a female character, especially as a teenager, who was feisty and opinionated and unapologetic.\u201d\n\nStiles soon earned the moniker \u201cthe thinking teenager\u2019s movie goddess,\u201d a reputation that got cemented when, at the height of her Hollywood rise, she enrolled in Columbia University, graduating with an English literature degree in 2005.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for Stiles to reconcile how all that played into her career: where she was being steered as a hot commodity in the industry, what she wanted from her career, and her own ambitions for education on top of it all.\n\n\u201cIt happened to me before I could really understand what was going on,\u201d she says. Going to college helped her keep her head on straight. \u201cAcademic professionals don\u2019t really give a shit about me being in a movie or having to go the MTV Movie Awards. But then also people in the entertainment industry don\u2019t really care about university. That helped me a lot.\u201d\n\nWhat fame meant, what it meant to have things you say written in print or scrutinized, is something she learned through trial and error. \u201cI\u2019m still figuring it out, but I feel a little less anxious about it than I did in my twenties.\u201d She laughs. \u201cTherapy helped.\u201d\n\nI ask her if she thinks she was ever being pulled in opposing directions, the way it appears if you look at her list of IMDb credits at the time. There\u2019s the romantic dramas and comedies that seem to have been meant to capitalize on her 10 Things I Hate About You popularity\u2014A Guy Thing or The Prince and Me among them\u2014and then the string of Shakespearean films that seemed to more squarely line up with her \u201cthinking teenager\u201d reputation.\n\n\u201cI think there was the commercial viability of romantic comedies and that\u2019s how people saw me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then there was what I was interested in, and I was trying to balance both. But I was also so young and had to learn how to stick up for myself and assert what I wanted.\u201d\n\nThat took some time, and some stepping back.\n\n\u201c I think there was the commercial viability of romantic comedies and that\u2019s how people saw me. And then there was what I was interested in, and I was trying to balance both. But I was also so young and had to learn how to stick up for myself and assert what I wanted. \u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that she wasn\u2019t working, or that the projects weren\u2019t seen. There was The Omen remake in 2006 and Silver Linings Playbook in 2012, with the Jason Bourne film franchise dotting her resume from 2002 until the most recent installment in 2016. She earned some of the best reviews of her career when she joined the Showtime drama Dexter for a season in 2010, earning Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for her performance.\n\nThe experience was formative, not just in terms of revealing what goes into a well-written, long-running show\u2014something she\u2019d remember when considering joining Riviera\u2014but also some of the frustrations that can plague actors who are years into a long TV contract. And while playing a rape survivor on a revenge-murder spree marked a definite departure from the roles she had been known for, she says she actually didn\u2019t see a noticeable change in what she was being offered after the whole experience.\n\nThe story that actually pops into her head is from the Golden Globes, when she attended as a nominee. As usual, the names of everyone nominated in her category are read out as the camera pans to each actress. When Stiles\u2019 name was read, however, the camera showed the wrong person\u2014a producer from the show instead. \u201cSo that was like, you know, a great reminder to not get too confident.\u201d\n\nShe takes great pride in the praise that her character on Riviera, Georgina, gets. An art curator whose life is upended by the mysterious death of her billionaire-husband, Georgina has been described as \u201ca female Michael Corleone.\u201d\n\nAs such, she says the idea of \u201clikability\u201d comes up often on the Riviera set. At the end of season two, for example, her character commits a violent crime. There was a version of the script where it\u2019s committed in self-defense, but Stiles fought for it to be unequivocally deliberate.\n\n\u201cIt was the question of, is she sympathetic, and I was like, I don\u2019t really care,\u201d she says. \u201cAny mafia movie or gangster movie you watch, you can have a guy running around with a gun and it\u2019s cool. But if you give a woman a gun in a movie or TV show, you have to jump through hoops to explain why she needs it.\u201d\n\nThe gender double standard leads us to talk about The Bell Jar. For years, she held the rights to the Sylvia Plath novel, about a woman\u2019s descent into mental illness, even commissioning a script.\n\n\u201cNobody wanted to make it because they said it was too dark,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it was at a time when nobody was interested in female-driven stories.\u201d She had envisioned a \u201cvery hallucinogenic\u201d approach, citing director Julian Schnabel\u2019s style in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. By 2012, she had decided to give up the rights.\n\nIn 2016, it was announced that Kirsten Dunst would direct an adaptation starring Dakota Fanning, but Dunst recently said she was no longer attached. Fanning is still involved with a version in development at Showtime as a limited series, but that\u2019s also been plagued by uncertainty: SMILF\u2019s Frankie Shaw was at one point going to direct, before her development deal was suspended amidst misconduct allegations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where things are now,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cBut now I think there\u2019d be much more of an audience for it.\u201d\n\nBefore she heads out to resume baby duty\u2014her son with husband Preston Cook turns two in November\u2014she makes a point to pick this entertainment journalist\u2019s brain for some TV recommendations, as she was nearly done with her current binge of Netflix\u2019s Dead to Me.\n\nAt the mention of Fleabag, she both gets visibly excited and turns a bit red. She had the chance to meet creator and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge at the BAFTA Awards, she explains, \u201cand totally fucking embarrassed myself.\u201d Primed with some liquid courage, she gushed to Waller-Bridge about how much she loved her work. When the conversation had run its course, Stiles said goodbye and for some reason\u2014she\u2019ll never be entirely sure why\u2014she winked at her. \u201cLike an asshole,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThen I was like, \u2018Oh my god, why did I do that? I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019\u201d She began fabricating excuses. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m tired and have a twitch\u2014like you know when you\u2019re tired and your eye just starts twitching?\u2019 I totally embarrassed myself.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s still shaking her head when the waitress brings the leftover food from lunch for her to take home. She gets up to leave and it clicks why the silly story is so endearing. It\u2019s Kat. It\u2019s Sara in Save the Last Dance. It\u2019s Joan in Mona Lisa Smile. It\u2019s Elizabeth in Hustlers. It\u2019s goofy and vulnerable, from a person you didn\u2019t expect it from, who you now understand better because of it. It\u2019s Julia Stiles.", "description": "For too long, Stiles felt that she didn\u2019t fit anywhere in Hollywood.
