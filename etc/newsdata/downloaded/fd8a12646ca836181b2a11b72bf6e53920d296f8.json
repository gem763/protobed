It was the first PGA Tour event played in Japan.\n\nWoods, who had to play seven holes on Monday in the weather-affected event, finished at 19-under 261 in his first tournament since undergoing arthroscopic left knee surgery two months ago.\n\nTiger Woods tees off at the 9th hole during the fourth round of the Zozo Championship golf tournament on Monday\n\nTiger Woods hits a shot out of a bunker on the 18th hole during the final round of the Zozo Championship on Monday\n\nWhen he turned professional in 1996, Woods had two landmarks in mind that he knew would occupy him for much of his career. One, was Jack Nicklaus's total of 18 majors.\n\nThe other was Snead's all-time record of 82 victories on the PGA Tour.\n\nAfter making progress towards the Niklaus record for the first time in 11 seasons with his 15th major success at the Masters in April, Woods - playing in his first tournament for nine weeks following a fifth bout of surgery on his knee - signed off a comeback year by moving alongside Snead.\n\nGolf legend Sam Snead waves to spectators during a special challenge match of past British Open Champions on the Old Course at St. Andrews, Scotland in July 2000.
