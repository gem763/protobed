Realizing there were no systems in place to monitor the health of firefighters combating wildfires, Herrera and nurse Vicen\u00e7 Padr\u00f3 began collecting data by hand. Eventually, they joined forces with three IT professionals, Salom\u00e9 Valero, Josep R\u00e0fols, and Marco Rodriguez, and the team joined the Call For Code challenge.\n\nAccording to an IBM press release:\n\nThe health device\u2014which is about the size of a smartphone and straps to a firefighter\u2019s arm\u2014has multiple sensors that measure key variables including temperature, humidity, and smoke concentration. This information is collected and transmitted to IBM\u2019s Cloud IoT platform; then, a Node-RED workflow sends the data to the IBM Watson-based machine learning model, which distills the information into a simple color-coded status for fire command centers to monitor the health of each deployed firefighter in real-time.\n\nA distinguished panel of judges led by President Bill Clinton chose Prometeo from a field of 32 finalists. The top five teams received awards, per IBM:\n\nSecond place: Sparrow\u2014whose members hail from India, China, and the US. The Sparrow team developed an open source conversational AI platform that helps users address their physical and psychological well-being during and after natural disasters by matching them with automated support and live experts. Sparrow was awarded USD $25,000. Third place awarded to Rove, an SMS chatbot that uses natural language understanding to give users health information during a natural disaster. Rove was awarded USD $25,000. Fourth place AsTeR was awarded USD $10,000. Fifth place Healios was awarded USD $10,000.\n\nCall for Code is an annual challenge held by IBM, David Clark Cause, and their partners that solicits technology-based ideas that can help mitigate the catastrophic effects of natural disasters. It culminates in an annual challenge, but also features numerous hackathons and other events that occur around the globe at IBM-sponsored events throughout the year.\n\nTNW spoke with R\u00e0fols a few days before the winners were announced. He told us they wanted to win the first prize so they could take their project \u201cthe next level.\u201d When asked what it was like participating in Call for Code this year, he told us:\n\nIt was very exciting! The people from IBM are helping us to improve our project. They were so wonderful.\n\nCongratulations to R\u00e0fols and the rest of the Prometeo team, and everyone else who participated in this year\u2019s Call for Code challenge!\n\nCheck out IBM\u2018s website for more information about this year\u2019s winning teams, and for more info about the Call for Code challenge, click here.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F09%2Fcall-for-code.jpg&signature=ef871196bbae6ce048a12e8eaf811378", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
