'He has to be.'\n\nLys Mousset celebrates at full-time after scoring the leveller for Sheffield United at West Ham\n\nAnd all players have to be ready to take the rough with the smooth to stay in the plans of the Blades' impressive manager.\n\nWilder's man-management style, rare in the modern game according to those who know him well, is one of his greatest strengths and has underpinned his rise from non-League to the Premier League.\n\nHe is renowned for keeping players on their toes and commands such respect from his players who know they need to perform every day just to give themselves a chance of game time.\n\nWhen he needs to make selection calls what has happened in the past has no bearing and he is never afraid to leave anyone out.\n\nWilder's players know, question one of his decisions or sulk at your peril.\n\nChris Wilder's honest man-management style has led to Sheffield United's meteoric rise\n\nThe challenge if they are dropped is simple \u2014 take it on the chin and when your next chance comes, take it, just as Mousset did, shrugging off any disappointment to score his third goal of the season to cancel out Robert Snodgrass's opener.\n\nFrench striker Mousset is also another example of a characteristic that runs right through Sheffield United.\n\nFrom impressive young goalkeeper Dean Henderson to veteran striker Billy Sharp, Wilder's squad is packed with players getting their first genuine crack at the Premier League.\n\nThey are getting that chance because of him \u2014 he is not afraid to remind them of that \u2014 and that increases their desire to deliver for him.\n\nIn Mousset's case he struggled to make much of an impression at Bournemouth who were happy to let him go.\n\nBilly Sharp symbolises the desire within the Blades squad to grasp their top flight opportunity\n\nMousset has matched his league tally from 58 games for Bournemouth in just seven at United\n\nUnited's \u00a310m bid gave them a \u00a34.6m profit on a player who was never going to get past Callum Wilson, Josh King and Dominic Solanke and scored just five goals in 71 appearances.\n\nMousset did not jump out as a potential solution to Wilder's search for a regular source of goals but, so far, he is one of many players Wilder is squeezing extra out of.\n\nHis equaliser at the London Stadium ensured he has already matched his league tally from 58 appearances for Bournemouth in just seven for United.\n\n'Great stat,' said Wilder. 'When you score goals at any club people are going to take notice. And you might see a few more Mousset shirts around Sheffield this week.'\n\nIf his popularity does grow, Mousset knows who he needs to thank.", "description": "With one blunt, five-word response Chris Wilder gave a small window into the approach that has made him such a success as a manager.", "authors": ["Adrian Kajumba For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/21/20256492-0-image-a-66_1572212761166.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
