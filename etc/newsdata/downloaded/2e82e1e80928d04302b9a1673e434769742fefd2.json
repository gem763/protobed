He added that it was not tourism itself that is subject to sanctions but the mechanics of the money flows.\u201cThere is a difficulty in reprising past methods of tourism [to Mount Kumgang] because of [UN] Security Council sanctions,\u201d Moon said.By implication, a new method may be considered that could act as a way for Seoul to placate North Korea, whose denuclearization talks with the United States have stalled. Individual trips by South Korean citizens to Mount Kumgang which would not involve Hyundai Asan collecting and transferring payments to Pyongyang, as was done in the past, has been cited as one method by which the North could achieve tourism gains within the parameters of sanctions.South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told reporters on Thursday that individual tourism was an issue under the Unification Ministry\u2019s jurisdiction, since it oversees all permits in relation to entry into the North.Yet it is also disputed whether such individual tours to the North, which have been offered by North Korean travel companies to Europeans - and U.S. citizens until Washington banned them in Sept. 2017 - are free from sanctions after all. United States Executive Order 13722 restricts a range of economic support to the North, primarily focusing on material goods that can be deemed as benefitting the regime\u2019s nuclear or ballistic missile programs. UN Security Council Resolution 2270 bans the transfer of any material or financing related to the North\u2019s weapons programs.Mount Kumgang tours, which began in 1998, involved thousands of tourists visiting the mountain resort.BY SHIM KYU-SEOK [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
