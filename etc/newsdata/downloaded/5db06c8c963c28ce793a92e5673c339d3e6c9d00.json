Meanwhile, a 70,000-strong militarized police force called the National Guard has drawn criticism for being used heavily to keep migrants from reaching the US border.\n\nAsked about the ambush on Tuesday, Amlo said the government would continue with its strategy. \u201cThis is a violent area, and we are going to continue attending to the causes of this kind of social decomposition,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Falko Ernst, Mexico analyst of the Crisis Group, the problem is that this focus on the long term is allowing entrenched conflicts, like the one in Michoac\u00e1n, to spin out of control.\n\n\u201cThere is no short-term strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the very least, these groups are getting the message that the leash is loose \u2013 and it makes sense for them to test how far they can go.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s ambush was claimed by the CJNG, which is currently fighting to seize the region known as Tierra Caliente \u2013 the Hot Land \u2013 from a litany of other armed groups.\n\nThese include the remnants of older cartels partially dismantled by government offensives of the past (such as the once-dominant Knights Templar), former armed vigilante groups and the different police forces \u2013 all of which are deeply corroded by links to organized crime.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The memorial service in Morelia.
