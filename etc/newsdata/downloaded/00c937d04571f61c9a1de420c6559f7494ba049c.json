And the more ambitious a project is, the more chance it has of becoming part of the history of a city.\u201d\n\nDirand approaches all interior projects in the same manner, be they residential, hospitality, even maritime. (He\u2019s now working on what by his estimation is \u201cthe most beautiful sea-going exploratory boat in the world\u201d.)\n\nFrancois-Xavier Lalanne's Mouton de Laine in the living room of the Avenue Montaigne apartment. Adrien Dirand\n\nHe begins by analysing what he calls the interior\u2019s \u201cprogram\u201d \u2013 the perspectives, the constraints, how light enters and air flows through a space \u2013 then removes what he deems inessential, even detrimental, to arrive at a new clarity, the interior\u2019s \u201cessence\u201d.\n\nFrom there he builds up layers of restraint: subtle textures, gentle hues (it\u2019s often hard to discern an actual colour), bespoke fittings that act as volumetric blocks to rhythm a room. He\u2019s aiming for what he calls \u201ca delicate equilibrium between the heavy, the bold, and the fragile\u201d.\n\nDirand walks this fine line with finesse, even in the most grandiose of projects. Projects such as a 600-square-metre apartment in an impeccable Haussmannian building on the Avenue Montaigne, nestled (as much as a behemoth can nestle) amid the flagship boutiques of the world\u2019s most famous fashion houses.\n\nThe Paris residence of an Eastern European heiress who gave the designer carte blanche to create his dream interior, it was reimagined by Dirand as an urban retreat for a contemporary princess.\n\nI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever gone so far in terms of detailing and complexity of fabrication as I did in the Avenue Montaigne apartment. \u2014 Joseph Dirand\n\nLuckily, when Emperor Napol\u00e9on III appointed Baron Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann to masterplan Paris in the mid-19th century, it was precisely with this kind of noblesse in mind.\n\nHaussmann decreed that under his watch, apartment buildings would all be five floors high, created from sculpted sandstone and with uniform fenestration in order to create harmonious city blocks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe interior program followed these exterior strictures, with the first floor \u2013 or \u00e9tage noble \u2013 being the most desirable since easily attainable by stairs (the elevator hadn\u2019t yet been invented) but still a remove from the street.\n\nThe bath tub of the Dirand-designed apartment is carved from a single block of Estremoz marble. Adrien Dirand\n\nCeiling heights were fixed at 3.35 metres, windows close to full height to create a lightness across the facades as much as to illuminate the interiors. Better bones are hard to imagine.\n\nDirand\u2019s client had acquired two adjacent apartments along one of Haussmann\u2019s finest avenues and the designer (who trained as an architect) devised a symmetrical floor plan to unify them, placing grand entertainment and reception areas at the centre of the plan, and private zones to the edges.\n\nThe breathtaking grandeur of the reconfigured volumes is something another interior architect might possibly have achieved. But Dirand\u2019s skill is in imbuing those rigorous spaces with a sensuality that propels them well beyond the bounds of bon go\u00fbt and into the stratosphere of uncharted chic.\n\nWood panelling throughout has been washed in hand-blended shades of ever-so-slightly-off-white, sometimes tinged palest sage; where light switches have been installed on marble surfaces, they\u2019ve been painted to marry perfectly with the stone\u2019s veining.\n\nIn the gallery-sized dressing room, cabinetry was hand-painted \u2013 using sable brushes, not rollers \u2013 and tested at various times of day to ensure a consistent \u201cTurner fog effect\u201d, as the designer calls it, referring to the dissipated light in the English artist\u2019s paintings.\n\nIn the dramatically minimal bathroom, the freestanding tub is carved from a single block of snowy white Estremoz marble. It sits in the middle of the room, like an altar. Something of a Dirand signature, in its sculptural rigour the single-block bathtub is reminiscent of the honey-hued alabaster bath set created for couturier Jeanne Lanvin by Armand-Albert Rateau in the mid-1920s.\n\nThe Lanvin bathroom and boudoir is a permanent installation at the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, a fine example of French excellence, an art-historical reference even. It\u2019s not hard to imagine Dirand\u2019s work figuring in that prestigious collection in the not-too-distant future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs an interior architect, I try to place my work within the grand tradition of the French decorative arts, pushing the limits of our savoir faire to the extreme,\u201d says Dirand. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever gone so far in terms of detailing and complexity of fabrication as I did in the Avenue Montaigne apartment.\u201d Not yet, anyway.\n\nDirand\u2019s acute awareness of belonging to the history of the French decorative arts means that he feels a great responsibility to ensure its future. For him, \u201cthe real client is the project itself\u201d.\n\nAcross town, over in Paris\u2019 Sentier district, Pierre Yovanovitch shares Dirand\u2019s respect for the history of a building, insisting \u201cit doesn\u2019t work to do a tabula rasa of the past\u201d.\n\nBut where Dirand prioritises the project \u2013 \u201cthe building tells me what it needs to be\u201d \u2013 Yovanovitch spends a long time analysing the client\u2019s needs \u2013 \u201care they great entertainers, or recluses, for instance?\u201d \u2013 in order to deliver a unique environment tailored to its residents\u2019 desires.\n\nPierre Yovanovitch designed for Pierre Cardin for eight years before moving into interior design. Antoine Doyen\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if each project has its own alchemy, its own circumstances which bring it to life in a particular way. Which means that each project is different and we need to reinvent ourselves with each new adventure.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch, who was named 2019\u2019s Designer of the Year by Wallpaper magazine, is a deft hand at historical nuance: his quirky interiors emanate a mid-century French vibe offset by strangely frisky furniture and fittings of his own design.\n\nWhereas Dirand strives for an \u201cequilibrium\u201d, Yovanovitch seeks \u201ca sort of tension\u201d which arises when apparently incompatible materials and forms are brought together.\n\nYou can feel it in the apartment he designed on the Quai d\u2019Orsay, where a kooky, quadrilateral fireplace in ceramic is attended by an oversized, serpentine sofa and a pair of plump armchairs that have headrests shaped like cute animal ears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTitled Ours (bear), the chairs, like all the other pieces, are of Yovanovitch\u2019s own design and a nod to his hero, mid-century French designer Jean Roy\u00e8re, whose Ours Polaire sofa is one of the most sought-after items on the secondary market.\n\nYou can feel a sort of tension, too, in the sitting room of another Yovanovitch apartment near the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, where doorways have been splayed at oblique angles, walls panelled in sandblasted oak and a rugged daybed seems to have been hewn from a massive tree trunk. Fine, inky-blue linen upholstery adds an offbeat-luxe touch.\n\nA Yovanovitch apartment on the Quai d'Orsay features elements he designed himself, such as the quadrilateral fireplace in ceramic, the serpentine sofa and Ours armchairs with animal ear headrests.

Jean Francois\n\n\u201cI strive for a certain chic, but it\u2019s a chic which arises from restraint, an ordering of the levels of opulence involved in a decor,\u201d the designer says.\n\nYovanovitch\u2019s interiors always feature a savvy mix of vintage and contemporary pieces, which means that his rooms echo with the familiar but reverberate into the future.\n\nDoorways at oblique angles in a Yovanovitch apartment near the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale.

Jean Francois\n\n\u201cI like to mix contemporary with vintage to create a rich, complete interior, something that feels as if it\u2019s been built up gradually over time,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s important that for each job we recount a story, and we do this by creating a d\u00e9cor that is completely adapted to the client but in which the spirit of the architect is also immediately recognisable.\u201d\n\nLike Dirand, he\u2019s also ventured beyond significant private interiors, and added to the cultural landscape by creating highly refined, intensely thoughtful semi-public spaces.\n\nYou can see his work at the rustic-chic Quinta da Co\u0302rte inn which opened late last year, set amid the vineyards of the Alto Douro region of Portugal; a new must-do on the porto-tasting trail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso melding public and private is Studio KO (\u201cKO\u201d is a homonym for the French pronunciation of \u201cchaos\u201d, a charming provocation).\n\nFournier and Marty are expert in a robust elegance \u2013 grand Parisian apartments reinvigorated with unabashed decorative \u00e9lan; country villas that seem to surge from the landscape itself.\n\nKarl Fournier (left) and Oliver Marty opened Studio KO immediately after graduating from architecture in 2000. Mathieu Salvaing\n\nThere\u2019s also the Chiltern Firehouse for hotelier Andr\u00e9 Balazs, which cemented Marylebone\u2019s position as the hippest London neighbourhood as soon as it opened in February 2014.\n\nThe pair have a Paris establishment in the pipeline for Balazs, although details are still under wraps.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing we find more terrifying than the client who says \u2018do what you like\u2019,\u201d confesses Karl Fournier, the de facto spokesman of Studio KO.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a dialogue with our clients, a to-and-fro, a combining of our tastes with theirs. Taste imposed by the decorator on-high, that doesn\u2019t interest us at all.\u201d\n\nA recent KO project, an expansive apartment on the 17th-century Place du Palais-Bourbon, illustrates the intensity of this collaborative narrative approach.\n\nIt was renovated in the early 1990s by flamboyant American decorator Tony Duquette and acquired a few years back by a wealthy art collector; KO\u2019s mission was to update the space for today while retaining a sense of its recent rococo past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormer glitter has been transformed into contemporary glamour: window casements are lined with antique mirrors to bounce light in from outside; a polished brass room divider features pivoting panels that can be adjusted to reflect movement inside; a shimmering metal picture rail runs through the entire space, not only allowing easy rehanging of a constantly changing collection but literally forming a thread through the home, uniting rooms that play on disparity more than uniformity.\n\nThe glitz is offset by rich, Brazilian rosewood joinery, including parquet laid in an intricate coffer motif throughout the reception rooms, matched by walnut wall panelling in the study and master bedroom.\n\nIn this Studio KO apartment in the 8th arondissement, the mid-century modern furniture riffs off the neo-classical windows. Yann Deret\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re speaking to a client about an apartment it\u2019s usually their principal residence,\u201d says Fournier, who points out that KO is often commissioned to design the holiday homes for its clients as well.\n\n\u201cSo it needs to perfectly reflect their self, their personality. The idea in each case is to treat the apartment as a portrait of the client. So the question is always, \u2018What does the client want their home to say about them?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe walnut-panelled bedhead at the Studio KO apartment in the 7th arondissement. Yann Deret\n\nIf they\u2019re commissioning KO, you can bet the client wants a sense of decorative excess attenuated by a pronounced architectural rigour.\n\nIn fact, to varying degrees it\u2019s this dialogue between the severity of modernism and a d\u00e9lire of the decorative that underpins the work of all three studios \u2013 even if each took a different path to what is today widespread acclaim.\n\nFournier and Marty met while studying architecture at the \u00c9cole des Beaux Arts in the mid-1990s, setting up Studio KO straight after graduating, in 2000.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t see the need to spend years working for established practices before launching out on our own,\u201d says Fournier. \u201cIt was cheeky, but it worked.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch studied commerce, then segued into fashion, designing the menswear collections for Pierre Cardin for eight years before realising his real affinity was for interior design. He set up his studio in 2001 \u201cwith strictly zero clients\u201d and no training. \u201cIt was madness, but I just had to do it,\u201d he says.\n\nDirand grew up surrounded by images of incredible interiors since his father, Jacques, was an esteemed architectural photographer. (Joseph\u2019s brother, Adrien, also a photographer, shoots all Dirand\u2019s interiors.)\n\nHe studied at the Ecole d\u2019Architecture de Paris and set up his own agency upon graduating, age 23. \u201cI began by doing small interior design projects and that set the foundations for my work ever since,\u201d he recalls.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of this m\u00e9tier: it\u2019s one big adventure. We don\u2019t do the daily grind, we reinvent ourselves with each new project, we don\u2019t know from one day to the next what kind of story we\u2019re going to be asked to recount. So there\u2019s a certain element of magic to this job.\u201d\n\nThe November issue of AFR Magazine, including the Young Rich List, is out on Friday, October 25 inside The Australian Financial Review.
