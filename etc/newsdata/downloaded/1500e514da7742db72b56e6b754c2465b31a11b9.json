But senators\u2019 votes could change by the time they receive the articles of impeachment from the House.\n\nThat is why tracking the changes in the president\u2019s support in the polls is so important. Members of Congress will factor in what the public thinks as well as their own assessments of the president\u2019s behavior.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, these are difficult measurements to make. As with all polling, the results depend to some extent on who is polled, what they are asked and when.\n\nWhom are you asking?\n\nNew polls on the topic are being released every couple of days, and journalists are reporting on the latest shifts in opinions.\n\nMany stories link attitudes on impeachment to the president\u2019s level of support as measured in his approval ratings.\n\nAttitudes on impeachment \u2014 and presidential approval \u2014 reflect the current state of political polarization in the U.S. Trump\u2019s approval ratings are determined by strong support among Republicans and disapproval among Democrats; party identification has become the primary determinant of most attitudes in the U.S.\n\nMost polls involving political issues focus on one of three target populations: adults 18 years of age and older, registered voters or likely voters.\n\nEach of these is a subset of the previous one. Most importantly, each subset is generally more Republican-leaning as well.\n\nPresidential approval is commonly measured for all adults. But questions about candidate support \u2014 relevant as the U.S. works through the primaries and next year\u2019s election approaches \u2014 are typically analyzed for registered or likely voters.\n\nAs these samples get smaller by definition and therefore more Republican, this usually mean greater support for Donald Trump and less for impeachment.\n\nPolitical groups will sometimes produce press releases based on selected samples, such as people \u201cin Republican-held congressional seats and National Republican Congressional Committee targets.\u201d These groups are obviously more likely to be partisan and unrepresentative of the national population.\n\nPartisanship is strongly related to attitudes about impeachment. Consumers should look for differences in opinions by party identification in any single poll. Changing attitudes over time could be related to differences in the partisan composition of samples from different polls, even from the same polling organization.\n\nDemocrats are generally more willing to participate in polls while Republicans disproportionately refuse. This potential problem has appeared in some polls in the past. This makes it especially important to compare the partisan makeup of poll samples from different firms, as well as whether the partisan composition is changing over time for the same polling organization.\n\nWhat are you asking?\n\nBut what does \u201csupport\u201d for impeachment mean?\n\nPollsters are asking a variety of questions to measure that concept.\n\nSome use the phrase \u201cstart an impeachment inquiry\u201d while others use the phrase \u201cimpeach President Donald Trump and remove him from office,\u201d asking for a harsher judgment. \u201cSupport\u201d is generally higher in response to the first question than in the second.\n\nDue to the variations in question wordings used in different polls, the search for shifts in opinions over time can be sensitive to the wording used in the polls.\n\nSome polls are asking about how high a priority impeachment and removal of Trump should be.\n\nIn some polls, the impeachment question includes an explicit \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d option, while in others it is a volunteered response. The proportion of \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d responses is quite variable right now from poll to poll, but I expect it to decline over time as people are exposed to more news coverage.\n\nComparing results from different polls using different wording can be confusing and misleading, so it is best to compare polls conducted by the same organization at different points in time to see whether support for impeachment is stable, increasing or decreasing.\n\nWhen are you asking?\n\nPublic opinion on impeachment will change as more information becomes available from additional sources. Those sources could include a second whistleblower and documents disclosed by the congressional inquiry.\n\nPolls about impeachment have been conducted since Robert Mueller began his investigation. However, the number of polls increased substantially after news about President Trump\u2019s phone conversation with the president of Ukraine.\n\nThese opinions were pretty stable until that disclosure, with slightly more Americans opposing impeachment than not. Support for impeachment among Democrats was about twice as high as among Republicans, with self-described Independents split evenly.\n\nSince the disclosure of the phone call, support for impeachment among all groups has increased. It increased the most among Democrats, but also among Republicans, and now a majority of Americans support impeachment.\n\nIn my view as a polling researcher, the most consequential shifts in opinion on impeachment will be among Republicans and Independents, as Democrats are already pretty solid in their views.\n\nMichael Traugott is a research professor at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan.
