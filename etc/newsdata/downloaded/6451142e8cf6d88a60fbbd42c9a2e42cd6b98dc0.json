However, authorities are not obligated to release formal results until Tuesday.\n\nIn the upmarket Tunis suburb of La Marsa, long queues formed early at polling stations. \u201cThese are really historic moments. I got here at 7 a.m. ... to give my voice to our new leader who must protect our democracy,\u201d said Lilia Amri, 36, a bank worker.\n\nTunisia threw off autocratic rule eight years ago in a revolution that inspired \u201cArab Spring\u201d revolts in Egypt, Yemen, Bahrain, Libya and Syria, but it alone has enjoyed a peaceful transition to democracy.\n\nHowever, after years of economic troubles including high unemployment and inflation, many Tunisians have voiced frustration over their government\u2019s inability to improve living standards.\n\n\u201cI call on young people and all Tunisians to leave homes and exercise their electoral right,\u201d said electoral commission head Nabil Baffoun.\n\nHe said that by 3pm turnout stood only at 27.8%. In the 2014 election, turnout was higher than 50% in the presidential vote.\n\nIn the central Lafayette district of Tunis, dozens of people stood patiently queuing in the Rue de l\u2019Inde primary school in a whitewashed stucco courtyard under sky blue wooden shutters.\n\nKholoud Alwi, 27, said none of the candidates had convinced her. \u201cBut I have to vote. It\u2019s important for the country,\u201d she said.\n\nHeavily indebted, Tunisia\u2019s next government, like its last, will have to navigate popular demands to relax public purse strings while foreign lenders push for spending cuts.\n\nMany voters are disillusioned. In the poor Ettadamen district, Mouaz Chneifiya, a 42-year-old unemployed man, was sitting in a cafe and said he would not vote.\n\nA woman carries a child as she casts her vote at a polling station during presidential election in Tunis, Tunisia September 15, 2019.

The elections will end and the promises will be dropped as soon as they get into office like in past elections,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile foreign attention, especially in Arab countries, is focused on the moderate Islamist Ennahda party candidate Abdelfattah Mourou, Tunisians have been engrossed by the fate of media magnate Nabil Karoui.\n\nA court on Friday ruled he must stay in detention after his arrest last month on the three-year-old charges brought by a transparency watchdog, and which he denies. His supporters say he has been silenced.\n\nPrime Minister Youssef Chahed, as well as two former prime ministers, a former president and Defence Minister Abdelkarim Zbidi are also standing. So too is the conservative constitutional law professor, Kais Saied, largely unknown before the election but a prominent figure in recent opinion polls.\n\nTwo of the 26 candidates have withdrawn in recent days to support a rival, though their names still appear on the ballots.\n\nCROWDED FIELD\n\nWith so many in the race, Sunday\u2019s vote could produce a very close outcome, with few votes separating the two candidates who make the second-round run-off, due by Oct. 13, from the others.\n\nThe election was brought forward after the death in July of the incumbent Beji Caid Essebsi.\n\nAnalysts have warned that a close outcome, with several candidates near the cut-off point to make the second round, could make appeals likely.\n\nTunisia\u2019s president has direct control over foreign and defence policy while most other portfolios are handled by a prime minister chosen by parliament, for which an election will be held on October 6.\n\nWith that limited role, many candidates have emphasised their policies on security - an area in which Tunisia has improved since two jihadist attacks in 2015 killed scores of tourists, devastating the country\u2019s tourism sector.\n\nA pair of armed soldiers stood outside each polling station Reuters visited.\n\nDespite economic frustrations, many voters said they were proud of Tunisia\u2019s march to democracy.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nOutside the capital, in the village of Sidi Thabet, six middle-aged men sat debating the merits of rival campaigns in a field under the shade of a gum tree, having pulled chairs over from the cafe opposite.\n\nThey each had the inky forefinger that showed they had voted, and were united in concern at the poor level of public services in a local economy based on growing olives, vegetables and fruit, though they supported different candidates.\n\n\u201cWe all voted for different candidates but despite our differences, we are discussing it peacefully,\u201d said Noureddine Dridi, a service manager at a company.", "description": "Tunisians voted in the first round of an unpredictable presidential race on Sunday, with the electoral commission urging young people to head to the polls after a slow early turnout.", "authors": ["Tarek Amara", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430114838&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0CS", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
