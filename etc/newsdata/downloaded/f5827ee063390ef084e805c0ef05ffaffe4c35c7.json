Mr. Castro, who is polling near the bottom of the field, was the only candidate to attack Mr. Biden in such strong terms, drawing backlash that illustrated why other candidates had shunned that approach.\n\nAsked by a reporter Friday whether he would release his medical records to address \u201cconcerns,\u201d Mr. Biden, 76, said he would do so before votes are cast.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell concerns, man, you want to wrestle?\u201d he said lightheartedly. He continued, \u201cWhen I get the next physical. Look, I\u2019ll release my \u2014 before there\u2019s a first vote, that\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019ll release my medical records. There\u2019s no, I mean there\u2019s no reason for me not to release my medical records.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn Mr. Biden\u2019s camp, there is a persistent sense that his rivals and the news media are underestimating him and giving him too little credit for the blocs of support he has already claimed. Whatever the flaws in Mr. Biden\u2019s performance in Houston, there was no exchange in which an opponent obviously routed him, as Senator Kamala Harris of California did in the first debate and Mr. Booker did in the second.\n\nHe has faced many controversies throughout the campaign, his allies note, and he is still in the lead \u2014 a reflection, they argue, of the good will he enjoys from rank-and-file Democrats who feel that they already know him and who see him as best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump.", "description": "They have staked out diverging political paths, but have mostly refrained from attacking each other.
