Trump has denied wrongdoing.\n\nBut others only recently embraced the idea, after initial reluctance out of concern that the process might take attention away from more important issues to voters.\n\nHere is where the candidates stand now on impeachment.\n\nJoe Biden\n\nThe former vice president was the last major Democratic candidate to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment, after initially taking a measured approach that emphasized letting Congress work its way through the process.\n\nBiden had issued several blistering critiques of Trump\u2019s actions in Ukraine but did not outright call for his impeachment until Wednesday.\n\n\u201cTo preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe\u2019s shooting holes in the Constitution and we cannot let him get away with it.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nWarren, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts who is gaining on front-runner Biden in some opinion polls, called for impeachment in April, after Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report found multiple contacts between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia as Moscow was trying to sway the 2016 presidential election in his favor.\n\nWarren has said there was more than enough evidence that Trump obstructed justice in the Mueller report to impeach him.\n\nNow she says she supports having the impeachment focus be on Trump\u2019s Ukraine call because it was such a clear violation of the law.\n\n\u201cThe president is asking for help against one of his political rivals and asking a foreign government for a thing of value for himself personally,\u201d she told CNN after the inquiry was launched.\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nSanders, the U.S. senator who has represented Vermont in Congress since 1991, in June called on the House of Representatives to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump.\n\nSanders has called Trump a \u201cliar and a cheat\u201d and \u201cthe most corrupt president in the modern history of this country\u201d, but has not said he would support impeachment if it came to a vote in the Republican-led Senate.\n\nSanders has said it would be irresponsible to make a decision before reviewing the evidence.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s wrong for me to say he\u2019s guilty before the process unfolds,\u201d he told NY1 television after the inquiry began.\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\nThe young mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said in April that Trump \u201cdeserves impeachment\u201d but warned the process might take attention away from issues that are more important to Americans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to look away from a horror show,\u201d he said.\n\nHe warns that impeachment is not necessarily a win for Democrats, but says the president must be held accountable.\n\n\u201cThis is one of those moments that comes along where you just have to state what the right thing is and then figure out the politics around that, rather than the other way around,\u201d he told CNN after the Ukraine matter came to light.\n\nKamala Harris\n\nHarris, who sits on the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, is all-in on impeachment, having endorsed the move since April.\n\nThe former California attorney general warned the Trump administration in an Oct. 9 letter against trying to destroy evidence or intimidate witnesses.\n\nHarris, who confronted Biden on race issues in an earlier debate, rose to his defense last week when asked about his role in the Ukraine controversy.\n\n\u201cLeave Joe Biden alone,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what Donald Trump wants. The focus needs to be on him and his conduct and all of the members of his Cabinet who are aware or facilitated that should come before Congress to testify under oath.\u201d\n\nAndrew Yang\n\nThe entrepreneur best known for his $1,000 per month \u201cfreedom dividend\u201d proposal was one of the last Democratic candidates to support impeachment, believing, like Buttigieg, that it would detract from issues more important to voters.\n\n\u201cEvery moment that the story\u2019s about Donald Trump, that\u2019s a moment that Democrats aren\u2019t presenting a new vision for the country that can help move us forward,\u201d he told ABC days after Pelosi announced the inquiry.\n\nYang said impeachment was unavoidable nonetheless.\n\n\u201cYou have the president colluding with foreign leaders and putting pressure on them to kneecap political rivals - and cover it up.\u201d\n\nCory Booker\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee member called for impeachment proceedings to begin in May after Mueller said his team did not determine whether the president committed a crime and it was up to Congress to do so.\n\nAfter the whistleblower complaint emerged, Booker said he was confident his Republican colleagues would do the right thing when confronted with the evidence against Trump.\n\nThe former mayor of Newark, New Jersey, last week made clear he would not target Biden - or let anyone else try.\n\n\u201cIf you come after Joe Biden, you\u2019re going to have to deal with me,\u201d Booker told CNN.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke\n\nThe former Texas congressman welcomed the impeachment inquiry as the right thing to do regardless of political considerations.\n\nLike other Democrats, O\u2019Rourke stressed that Biden had done nothing wrong and the focus should be kept on Trump.\n\nHowever, without naming names, he noted Biden\u2019s son Hunter should not have been allowed to serve in a highly paid position with the Ukrainian gas company.\n\n\u201cI would not allow a family member, anyone in my Cabinet, to have a family member work in a position like that,\u201d he told the Washington Examiner.\n\nTom Steyer\n\nThe last person to join the 2020 Democratic presidential race was one of the first to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nThe billionaire environmentalist began a national campaign to remove Trump from office just nine months into his term.\n\nHis \u201cNeed to Impeach\u201d initiative has spent millions of dollars to that end since it launched in October 2017.\n\n\u201cI believe the truth was there two years ago,\u201d Steyer told MSNBC recently. Steyer will have a chance at his first debate to expound on why he thinks Trump is the most corrupt president in U.S. history, and a failed businessman to boot.\n\nAmy Klobuchar\n\nThe Minnesota senator joined calls for an impeachment inquiry in June, citing Trump\u2019s comments that he would be willing to listen if a foreign government approached him with damaging information on a political rival.\n\nFast forward four months. Klobuchar last week told CNN Trump was acting like a \u201cglobal gangster\u201d who \u201cis basically going to one leader after another trying to get dirt on his political opponent.\u201d\n\nAsked about Hunter Biden\u2019s position, Klobuchar added that she would not be comfortable with having her daughter sit on the board of a foreign company, \u201cbut that is not the issue.\u201d\n\nJulian Castro\n\nAlong with Warren, former housing secretary Castro sought Trump\u2019s impeachment in April after the Mueller report. He made a forceful argument for initiating an impeachment inquiry during a July presidential debate.\n\nAfter the House initiated proceedings, Castro said the best thing for the country would be getting Trump out of the White House.\n\n\u201cHe has used the office of the presidency to boost himself and put his own self-interest above the national interest,\u201d he told NPR. \u201cHow much more evidence do people need that this man should not be anywhere near the Oval Office?\u201d\n\nTulsi Gabbard\n\nThe congresswoman from Hawaii had been opposed to impeachment just a few days before she embraced it, the same week Pelosi announced a formal inquiry.\n\n\u201cUp to this point, I have been opposed to pursuing impeachment because it will further divide our already badly divided country,\u201d she said in a Sept. 27 statement.\n\nTrump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president and the whistleblower report on the matter convinced her that not pursuing the inquiry \u201cwill set a very dangerous precedent.\u201d", "description": "Twelve Democrats hoping to replace Donald Trump in the White House hold their fourth debate on Tuesday just three weeks after an impeachment inquiry ensnared the Republican president in a pitched battle with Democrats in Congress.", "authors": ["Doina Chiacu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440677907&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0RY", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
