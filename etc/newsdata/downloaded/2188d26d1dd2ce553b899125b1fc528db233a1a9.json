I\u2019m saying it shouldn\u2019t have been dealt with this way.\n\n\u2018Coleen could have gone down the route where she got a private investigator\u2026 I think she\u2019s going to be in the public eye so much more, they\u2019re both going to get trolling.\u2019\n\nRebekah denies Coleen\u2019s leak claims (Picture: Getty/Rex)\n\nChanetelle has been married to Emile since 2014 (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nShe added: \u2018Rebekah\u2019s had horrendous things sent to her.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a form of bullying in a way and I think it\u2019s unacceptable. I do not agree with anyone selling stories on anyone but I just think there\u2019s a better way to deal with it.\u2019\n\nHours after the drama unfolded, Rebekah, who is currently pregnant, shared a horrible message from an Instagram troll wishing harm on her unborn child.\n\nKerry, who is married to footballer Chris Whelpdale, continued: \u2018She\u2019s gone to up here from her bringing that out so her private life is completely destroyed from this and is going to bring up all stuff from the past as well.\u2019\n\nHowever, Chantelle felt Coleen was right to address the situation publicly and drew on her own experience from close friends selling stories about her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChantelle recalls how someone in her inner circle leaked stories about her relationship with husband Emile Heskey when they were in the early stages of dating.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a small circle of friends you\u2019ve got as it is, and it\u2019s someone you thought you\u2019d trust, it must be hard,\u2019 Chantelle weighed in.\n\n\u2018Maybe because Coleen\u2019s so quiet and private usually, maybe enough is enough.\n\n\u2018I think she\u2019s done her [Rebekah] a favour so now she can see where she\u2019s compromised.\n\nRebekah suggests her account was hacked (Picture: ITV/REX)\n\n\u2018WAGs are supposed to stick together.\u2019\n\nBut Kerry said Coleen should have considered her young children and what they may come across on social media.\n\n\u2018I just think I don\u2019t want my children growing up \u2013 they\u2019re not on social media yet \u2013 but I don\u2019t want them thinking that\u2019s the right way to go about handling situations.\n\n\u2018I would rather them talk to somebody [privately]. I just think they could have done it a lot better,\u2019 she said.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
