REUTERS/Hannah McKay\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Troubled British lender Metro Bank (MTRO.L) ditched a 250 million pound ($311 million) bond issue on Monday after failing to attract investors despite offering a hefty yield.\n\nMetro, which launched on British high streets in 2010, has endured a torrid year after disclosing a major loan book error in January that wiped more than 1.5 billion pounds off its stock value.\n\nThe bank has struggled to rebuild investor confidence since the error, while investor concerns about the economic impact of a potential disorderly Brexit have also weighed on its share price.\n\nThe British challenger bank had launched the deal on Monday morning, looking to raise a minimum of 250 million pounds of bail-in debt known as \u2018MREL\u2019 to meet an interim regulatory deadline of Jan. 1 2020.\n\nEven though the bank offered a chunky 7.5% yield on the new four-year bond issue \u2014 in November last year the bank was targeting a yield of 2%-4% for MREL debt \u2014 orders had only reached 175 million pounds by around 2 pm London time (1300 GMT).\n\nThe banks managing the transaction had also reduced the size of the deal sought from a minimum of 250 million pounds to 200-250 million pounds.\n\n\u201cMetro Bank PLC thanks the broad number of investors who have met with the company and shown interest in their potential inaugural MREL issuance. Given the current market conditions though Metro have elected to not proceed with a transaction at this time,\u201d the lender said in a statement.", "description": "Troubled British lender Metro Bank ditched a 250 million pound ($311 million) bond issue on Monday after failing to attract investors despite offering a hefty yield.", "authors": ["Abhinav Ramnarayan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433024303&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1ME", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
