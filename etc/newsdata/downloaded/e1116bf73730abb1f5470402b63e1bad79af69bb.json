First things first: the Switzerland international is a good player who cares tremendously and does not deserve anything like the negative reception he received upon his substitution against Aston Villa after 72 minutes. But his replacements, Lucas Torreira and the outstanding youngster Joe Willock, helped turbo-charge Arsenal\u2019s comeback while Matt\u00e9o Guendouzi played the second half like a man possessed. Xhaka, by contrast, looked hesitant and off the pace. He is nowhere near automatic selection territory on this season\u2019s form and Emery, who has delayed formally announcing Arsenal\u2019s next club captain, may have a tough decision to make.

Jo\u00ebl Matip was the best player on the pitch at Stamford Bridge, ensuring that Tammy Abraham\u2019s rich vein of goalscoring form came to an abrupt halt, and is playing with a calm and poise unrecognisable from his first couple of seasons at Anfield, when Liverpool\u2019s defence often resembled a comedy troupe. The Cameroonian has certainly had the last laugh, having established himself as central part of the division\u2019s best defence and helping keep a clean sheet in a triumphant Champions League final. Quite where this leaves the hugely promising Joe Gomez, though, is another question.

In the wake of Manchester United\u2019s 2-0 loss at West Ham, which came about after a dreadfully passive performance, the manager suggested his team had merely been unlucky to come down on the wrong side of the finest of margins. Solskj\u00e6r would have been within his rights to read the riot act but that has not been his style since he took on the job. The initial transformation he effected after succeeding Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was built on injecting positivity. Yet behind the scenes, it would have been a surprise if Solskj\u00e6r had not given the players a dressing-down. He has that in him and it was easy to read into his decision to send them out early for the second half. What is clear is that if Solskj\u00e6r truly believes United were let down only by their decision-making, the club have problems.

The Blades manager thought his side were poor in possession at Goodison, and admitted he was berating his players until he was interrupted by a defender who could not believe what he was hearing. \u201cPhil Jagielka chipped in: \u2018Gaffer, we\u2019ve just won at Everton,\u2019\u201d Wilder said. \u201cHe put it into perspective, so I ended up telling them they should go out and have a beer and not go home disappointed. I didn\u2019t mean to be over-critical, it\u2019s just the mardy-arse Yorkshireman in me. We are not much fun at times. It\u2019s a great feeling when you win any game of football, but I just felt if we play like that away from home for the rest of the season it is unlikely we will get anything.\u201d Wilder is probably right. They will not meet opponents as accommodating as Everton every week.

With five minutes left, and Manchester United\u2019s 24-year-old Premier League record of 9-0 against Ipswich to surpass, Kevin De Bruyne brilliantly smashed home the eighth but another goal would not come. Instead, with Leroy San\u00e9 and Aymeric Laporte out for the long term, there was satisfaction the club\u2019s key midfielder was looking in full working order. Two years ago this month, it was the Belgian conducting the orchestra in a 6-0 win at Watford that was probably the best performance of Pep Guardiola\u2019s first Premier League title-winning season. And it was De Bruyne who set the tone and tempo on Saturday, starting with the cross for David Silva to open the scoring after 52 seconds. Watford\u2019s hopes of a first victory over City since 1989 met a sudden end. There was worse \u2013 much worse \u2013 to follow.

That can mean changes of shape, but this season for Leicester it has tended to be more about switching personnel within that system. Three times, James Maddison has been used on the left; Saturday was the third time he has been used through the centre, a role he seemed to relish. His winner was fitting reward for an all-round performance in which Tottenham looked vulnerable to pretty much every Leicester attack. The presence of Jamie Vardy means defences are wary of exposing themselves to his pace by pushing too high, and that gives Leicester\u2019s creators a fraction more room in which to operate. Maddison exploited it brilliantly.

His Newcastle side had only 21% possession and the midfielder Isaac Hayden was so concerned he had approached the bench to say \u201cthis isn\u2019t working\u201d. Hats off to Bruce for responding but his problems run considerably deeper than tactics and team shape. Miguel Almir\u00f3n, Jonjo Shelvey and Jetro Willems were woefully off the pace and the evening should have ended with Brighton winning comfortably. Instead poor finishing and Bruce\u2019s late introduction of Allan Saint-Maximin\u2019s devastating pace and the returning Andy Carroll\u2019s aerial threat left Graham Potter\u2019s players ultimately clinging on for a point. Bruce\u2019s worry is that Saint-Maximin and Carroll\u2019s physical fragilities dictate they cannot always be relied on to rescue Newcastle.

Bournemouth\u2019s away win means that Southampton have won only 15 of their last 60 league matches at St Mary\u2019s. Or, to put it another way, they have averaged fewer than five victories a season at home over the past three years. At the risk of stating the obvious, that puts huge pressure on them to keep picking up the sort of results on the road that have seen them win at Brighton and Sheffield United already this season. Hasenh\u00fcttl said he takes comfort from the chances that have been created at St Mary\u2019s but the truth is that their most dangerous player on Friday was a midfielder \u2013 James Ward-Prowse. Moussa Djenepo\u2019s return from injury will help but Che Adams and Danny Ings \u2013 one goal between them so far \u2013 need to come good.

They showcased the best of themselves in a neat display against Norwich, playing with a tenacity and purpose their opponents lacked. And Chris Wood\u2019s partnership with Ashley Barnes up front is a force to reckon with, with the New Zealander finally getting the goals his performances have merited to see off Daniel Farke\u2019s side. Proper striker\u2019s goals too \u2013 a powerful set-piece header and a lovely near-post flick from a tricky angle. On their day they remain one of the best sides around at punishing defensive flimsiness.

In the end, it was the Palace manager left cursing his luck after the visitors snatched a point, Diogo Jota scoring with virtually the last kick of the game. Hodgson cannot feel too hard done by - Palace dominated the second half, but were distinctly second best in the first. It had looked like Wolves would see another promising display end in demoralising defeat, but perhaps their luck has finally changed. You might also argue Wolves made their own luck. Jota showed great persistence and composure to profit from Joel Ward\u2019s late slip, lifting morale before another busy week.
