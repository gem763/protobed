(Brian MacKay/CBC)\n\nIn Canada, building construction falls under provincial jurisdiction, but the federal government publishes and updates the National Building Code to provide a baseline starting point.\n\nSix provinces have accepted the national code as is. Alberta and British Columbia use the code, but with some variations. Ontario and Quebec have their own provincial codes.\n\nThis year thousands of Canadians were affected by floods.\n\nResidents along the Ottawa River were forced to evacuate their homes when water levels rose to record levels in May. The month before, the St. John River flooded homes throughout New Brunswick. In July, hay crops in British Columbia were destroyed when the Chilcotin River burst its banks.\n\nThe Canadian government says the frequency and severity of flooding will likely increase in the years ahead.\n\nCanadian basements\n\nCoulbourne Consulting has helped governments in the United States craft codes to build flood-resistant structures. But Canada's code needs to be tailor-made.\n\n\"In the U.S., one of the prohibitions when you're building in a flood plain is that you cannot build a basement,\" Coulbourne said.\n\n\"In Canada, colder temperatures mean deeper foundations for buildings. You pretty much [always] have a basement.\"\n\nSandbags stacked around a home in Woodmans Point, N.B., protect it during a springtime flood in May 2018. (Brett Ruskin/CBC)\n\nFor homes built alongside bodies of water, Coulbourne suggests assuming that a basement will flood on a semi-regular basis and to plan accordingly.\n\nThat would mean using a basement for storage boxes that could be easily moved upstairs when floodwaters rise.\n\n\"[It means] keeping the basement in place but using it as a place to collect water when it floods,\" he said. \"That's not a popular thing to do, as you can imagine. In some cases, that might be half their living space.\"\n\nWater more powerful than wind\n\nFor newer construction, keeping floodwaters out of basements is possible but challenging.\n\n\"The force of water is usually a lot higher than the load transferred into buildings from high winds and earthquakes,\" said Coulbourne. \"So water can actually exert quite a force on something like a building wall.\"\n\nHundreds of homes in Windsor, Ont., and Tecumseh, Ont., had their basements flooded after storms pummelled the region in 2017. (Jason Viau/CBC)\n\nIf the structure is built strong enough to withstand the force of the water, the next step is sealing every entrance.\n\n\"The effort in flood-proofing a building is really to search for all those places that water could penetrate the building and figure out how to seal them up,\" Coulbourne said.\n\nProviding guidance, not writing policies\n\nCoulbourne says his team is not telling the Canadian government exactly what its code should be.\n\n\"I don't think that's our place. We are going to stay out of the policy conversation as much as we can,\" he said.\n\n\"We are working on reports and guidance documents that would provide the NRC with information about what to use and how to consider the current information that's available in Canada.\"\n\nThe NRC says the reports and analysis from Coulbourne Consulting \"will be provided to codes committees for consideration in future editions of building codes, standards and guides.\"", "description": "The National Research Council has hired a team of American experts to help update Canada's building code to include measures to flood-proof homes and businesses.", "authors": ["Reporter Videojournalist", "Brett Ruskin Is A Reporter", "Videojournalist Covering Everything Local Breaking News To National Issues.
