A block trade is a large transaction that takes place off the open market in order to avoid moving the price too much.\n\nThe trade, which took place Tuesday, comes on the heels of a disappointing launch last week for the much-hyped Bakkt, whose on-exchange volume in its first five trading days totaled just over $5 million.\n\nRelated: It\u2019s Too Soon to Write Off Bakkt, Wall Street Analyst Tells ICE Investors\n\nTwo years in the making, Bakkt is the first live market in the U.S. for bitcoin futures that are physically delivered, meaning the buyer receives the underlying commodity.\n\nDespite Bakkt\u2019s inauspicious debut, Galaxy Digital and XBTO expressed confidence in the platform.\n\n\u201cAs the digital asset class continues to mature, we view the launch of Bakkt as a foundational piece of market infrastructure,\u201d Galaxy Digital said in ICE\u2019s press release.\n\nXBTO said in the release that it bought the first bitcoin daily futures last week, in addition to participating in the block trade.\n\nRelated: Trading Volume for Bakkt\u2019s Bitcoin Futures Hit Just $5 Million in First Week\n\nThe new bitcoin futures contract has been closely watched by crypto investors, as well as in the broader financial industry, where it\u2019s been billed as a product that might attract allocations from institutional money managers, including hedge funds, pension funds and endowments.\n\nGalaxy Digital is led by Mike Novogratz, a former Goldman Sachs executive who later helped run the hedge fund Fortress Investment Group. XBTO\u2019s CEO is Philippe Bekhazi, a formerly of Citibank and Steven Cohen\u2019s SAC Capital hedge fund.\n\nFriday\u2019s press release from Atlanta-based ICE didn\u2019t state whether the block trade was made in the exchange\u2019s monthly- or daily-settled futures contracts.\n\nIn the first two weeks since the start of trading, almost all activity has taken place in the monthly contract, but, even there, activity has disappointed.\n\nSome market analysts have even said that the sluggish uptake contributed to a drop last week in bitcoin prices, since it indicated a lack of demand among institutional investors \u2013 with most individual investors currently to gravitate toward the futures contracts started in late 2017 by the rival Chicago-based exchange CME.\n\nIn the first four days of this week, just 260 of the Bakkt\u2019s monthly futures contracts changed hands, worth about $2.1 million at the closing price of $8,152 per bitcoin on Thursday. While data wasn\u2019t available for Friday, the pace of trading is down from last week\u2019s volume of 623 contracts, which carried a value of just over $5 million.\n\nOn Tuesday, when the block trade crossed, some 27 of the monthly contracts changed hands, for a value of just $226,584 based on that day\u2019s closing price. No volume was reported in the daily contract for the day.\n\nBitcoin prices were little changed in the 24 hours through 17:00 UTC on Tuesday, though were down sharply from over $10,000 prior to the Bakkt contracts\u2019 debut on Sept. 19, based on CoinDesk\u2019s Bitcoin Price Index.\n\nCoinDesk\u2019s Michael Casey with Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler and ICE chairman and CEO Jeffrey Sprecher, image via CoinDesk archives\n\nRelated Stories", "description": "Crypto fund Galaxy Digital and OTC trader XBTO have conducted the first-ever block trade of Bakkt's bitcoin futures contract.", "authors": ["William Foxley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vB7NaTOIqkIMXaZxEsMT8A--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/0b8d9e4ba7a30d542c89e6dad11dd387", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
