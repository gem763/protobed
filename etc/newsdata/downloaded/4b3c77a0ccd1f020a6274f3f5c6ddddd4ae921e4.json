You can win the race even though you haven\u2019t got the quickest package. And that\u2019s what happened today,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt makes it so special. You start to doubt and you know where you have the deficit and then you cling on to these few hopes like a safety car (intervention). You\u2019re hanging it out there and then it happens.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just overwhelmed in the team. It\u2019s such an important step towards the championship also.\u201d\n\nMercedes lead Ferrari by 162 points in the constructors\u2019 standings with 220 remaining to be won.", "description": "Lewis Hamilton sped closer to a seemingly inexorable sixth Formula One title with a 'special' victory in Russia on Sunday, but the Mercedes driver still insisted he was taking it one race at a time.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435373468&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T050", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
