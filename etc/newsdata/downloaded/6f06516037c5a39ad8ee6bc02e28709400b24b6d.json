Trump Explored Cutting Grants for Schools Tied to Erdogan Foe\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Early in his presidency, Donald Trump\u2019s White House explored whether the U.S. could cut off taxpayer funding for a network of charter schools affiliated with a political opponent of Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe 2017 episode, never previously reported, came as the newly inaugurated U.S. president prepared to meet for the first time with Erdogan, an ostensible U.S. ally who has since complicated American Mideast policy by aligning his country with Russia and, this month, launching a military operation in northern Syria.\n\nThe debate over funding for the schools unfolded over a few weeks ahead of Erdogan\u2019s visit to the U.S. in May 2017, and one of the people who took an interest in the matter was former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, according to the people. He would later become Trump\u2019s personal attorney and drive events in Ukraine that have the president on the brink of impeachment.\n\nAdministration lawyers ultimately concluded they couldn\u2019t justify cutting off money for the schools, which are associated with a movement headed by a Turkish cleric and Erdogan opponent, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.\n\nIt\u2019s not known how the Gulen-linked schools came to the attention of the White House. The two people familiar with the matter said they were told that information about how to cut funding for the schools was sought for the president, though it\u2019s unclear if Trump himself requested it. The episode shows how Erdogan, from the start of Trump\u2019s administration, has appealed to the U.S. president. He has twice persuaded Trump to withdraw U.S. forces in Syria, against the advice of American military officials.\n\nIn December, Trump reversed himself after criticism by Republicans and the resignation of his defense secretary. But earlier this month, Trump agreed to remove troops from a region along Turkey\u2019s border, allowing Erdogan to begin an offensive to clear U.S.-allied Kurds and drawing bipartisan condemnation in Congress.\n\nExiled Cleric\n\nErdogan and Gulen were once political allies. But the Turkish president blames him for a failed coup in 2016 and has long sought Gulen\u2019s extradition from the U.S. to Turkey. Before Trump, Erdogan tried to persuade President Barack Obama to give up Gulen, who lives in self-imposed exile in the Poconos and has denied involvement in the attempted coup.\n\nIn early 2017, officials on the National Security Council and Domestic Policy Council asked Education Department officials whether it was possible to block money that the Gulen-affiliated schools received through a federal grant program for charter schools, people familiar with the matter said. The money is provided to states, which then distribute funding to schools.\n\nThe White House suggested that the Education Department could investigate whether Gulen was laundering money through the schools, or could argue that the schools\u2019 ties to Gulen -- a Muslim cleric -- amounted to a religious affiliation and meant they couldn\u2019t receive federal funding.\n\nBut the Education Department pushed back against both approaches. Department aides told the White House that the government would be seen as hypocritical and discriminatory if it continued to support Christian schools while punishing schools affiliated with Islam.\n\nMany officials in the department were particularly disturbed by the conversations because cutting funding would also deny resources to schools largely attended by low-income children, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nIn the end, the Education Department argued that the grants were multi-year funding for states, not just the Gulen schools. The money couldn\u2019t be pulled back without evidence of malfeasance or a violation of grant conditions, and cutting off the funding otherwise would violate the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, department officials concluded.\n\nThe schools still receive federal funding. A spokeswoman for the Education Department declined to make Secretary Betty DeVos available for an interview or comment for this story.\n\nWhite House spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment. The Turkish embassy in Washington also did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s Role\n\nWhile the administration was debating whether it could cut off money for the schools, Giuliani was pushing the White House to extradite Gulen, according to four people familiar with the matter.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s interest in Gulen and the schools isn\u2019t clear. At the time, he was a prominent Trump supporter but had not assumed his role as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. He was working for a Turkish gold trader, Reza Zarrab, who had been arrested in the U.S. and faced prosecution for his role in a scheme to evade Iranian trade sanctions. Erdogan wanted Zarrab released, and Giuliani was attempting to work out a diplomatic deal that would entail his client being freed.\n\nGiuliani participated in one phone call concerning the Gulen-linked schools\u2019 funding, according to a person who was also on the call. The person didn\u2019t know who Giuliani was representing on the call and couldn\u2019t remember what he said.\n\nAt one point, at Giuliani\u2019s request the White House gave a pamphlet about the Gulen-affiliated schools to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, as evidence there was something wrong with them, according to one person familiar with the matter. Tillerson discarded it, concluding the pamphlet was simply an advertisement for the schools and showed no evidence of wrongdoing, the person said.\n\nGiuliani didn\u2019t respond to a text message about this story or a message left with a man who answered his phone but didn\u2019t identify himself.\n\nThis year, as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Giuliani\u2019s role in a behind-the-scenes effort to pressure Ukraine\u2019s president into investigating Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, has emerged as a central focus of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nInternational Campaign\n\nTurkey\u2019s government has undertaken an international campaign to shut down Gulen-linked schools in dozens of countries around the world. A state-backed Turkish foundation is opening new schools to replace them, where the campaign has been successful. Erdogan has repeatedly said the Gulen schools provide capital for a \u201cterrorist\u201d group responsible for the 2016 coup, although those connections have been disputed by others.\n\nSince 2015, the Turkish government has paid $1.3 million to a law firm, Amsterdam & Partners, for a campaign to discredit U.S. schools allegedly run by Gulen\u2019s adherents. Turkey\u2019s lobbyists have contacted officials ranging from Senate staffers to local school boards in the effort, disclosures filed with the Justice Department show.\n\nRobert Amsterdam, the firm\u2019s founding partner, said in an interview that he was \u201cnot aware of Giuliani\u2019s involvement.\u201d He accused the schools of committing immigration fraud by hiring Gulen followers from Turkey under U.S. employment visas and said: \u201cGetting the government to wake up to this threat has been our job for years.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., the schools aren\u2019t formally organized and their ties to Gulen are indirect, at times including the employment of Turkish administrators, teachers and vendors who are adherents of his movement. Alp Aslandogan, executive director of the Alliance for Shared Values, a nonprofit that promotes Gulen\u2019s teachings, has described ties between taxpayer-funded U.S. charter schools and Gulen\u2019s movement as on the \u201cintellectual or inspirational level.\u201d\n\nAslandogan said in an email that Erdogan\u2019s pursuit of Gulen \u201cnow extends to trying to limit the educational opportunities available to American children. We are grateful that U.S. institutions are strong and can stand up to such pressure.\u201d\n\nCBS News counted about 136 Gulen-affiliated American schools in 2017. Some of the schools have been the subject of an FBI investigation into whether they secretly finance Gulen\u2019s organization. Critics say Gulen gets payments from supporters doing contract work on the schools or from \u201cdonations\u201d made by Turkish instructors brought to the U.S. on special visas to teach at them, charges he has rejected.", "description": "Trump Explored Cutting Grants for Schools Tied to Erdogan Foe", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB2C0AG_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
