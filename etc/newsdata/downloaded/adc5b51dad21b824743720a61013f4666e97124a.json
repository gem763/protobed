In a way, you had to admire his pluck. Going on about how all the pressure was on New Zealand in this Saturday\u2019s World Cup semi-final. About how the pressure was going to be \u201cchasing them down the street\u201d. About how nobody expected England to pull off an upset. All very theatrical, and all spectacular copy, gratefully accepted by the many journalists in the room. And yet, one imagines that in the All Blacks camp, Jones\u2019s words would have been taken less as a declaration of hostilities and more a statement of the bleeding obvious.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

As Warren Gatland once said of his upbringing in Waikato in the 1970s: \u201cBack then the All Blacks were the best team in the world, always had been and always would be. To discover that other countries played rugby, and were any good at it, came as something of a shock. You were brought up believing the All Blacks were invincible.\u201d\n\nAnd so from the moment an All Black slips on his jersey, the expectation to continue that success is total and unstinting. The number of hurdles overcome to claim the shirt in the first place, and the wealth of challengers looking to steal it, generate their own manic energy.\n\nPart of deconstructing an All Blacks team, then, is deconstructing the mythology around it. In the past, that weight of expectation has been as much burden as ballast. But since the agony and the exorcism of finally lifting the World Cup in Auckland eight years ago, they\u2019ve won close to 90 per cent of all the matches they\u2019ve played. In the World Cup itself, they\u2019re on a streak of 18 consecutive victories. Perhaps it\u2019s time to admit that this might all be a slightly more significant source of pressure than \u2013 say \u2013 an Eddie Jones press conference.\n\nThis is why so many of their opponents look beaten almost before a ball has been kicked. Certainly you suspect there was an element of this from Ireland at the weekend, who after suffering an intense and disastrous start never looked like they remotely believed they were capable of victory. We can argue the toss over whether this is a classic New Zealand side, but at their best they carry around the sort of aura that accompanies only the most dominant sporting champions: Vicente del Bosque\u2019s Spain, the Golden State Warriors, Australia\u2019s cricketers around the turn of their century, Rafa Nadal at Roland-Garros, Phil Taylor.\n\nHere, then, is the conundrum for their opponents. Do you try and treat them like any other team when, deep down, we all know they\u2019re not? Or is to acknowledge the aura, in a way, to succumb to it? This is why Jones\u2019s mind games are such a double-edged sword: on one hand, there\u2019s the potential of cutting the giant down to size, but by resorting to such tactics you\u2019re sort of admitting the existence of the giant in the first place.\n\nThe fact that this Saturday\u2019s game is only their second meeting in the space of five years merely adds to the sense of mystique. There was a wistful relish in the eyes of Ben Youngs here as he described his tussles with the All Blacks as the best atmosphere he\u2019d ever known as a rugby player. Youngs is one of half a dozen survivors from England\u2019s last victory over New Zealand at Twickenham in 2012, and knows exactly the sort of game that will be required. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be absolutely on it. They\u2019re the most dangerous team in the world at punishing you.\u201d\n\nFrom the younger members of the squad, there\u2019s a more carefree approach. \u201cI was never too fazed by the whole mystique of the All Blacks,\u201d said Anthony Watson. \u201cI respect the prolonged success they\u2019ve had as a team, but the whole aura that surrounds them and the \u2018invincible\u2019 stuff: I never bought into that. They are rugby players and we\u2019re rugby players. They are definitely beatable.\u201d\n\nOf course, talking a good game and playing one are two very different things. But 13 of this squad have a precious life experience to fall back on. The last Lions tour exposed rare frailties in the New Zealand edifice, as Gatland\u2019s side fought back from 1-0 down to square the series on foreign soil. Gatland\u2019s diary from that series is a worthwhile read, notably for its insights on how the Lions eschewed a conservative, risk-averse style of play in favour of taking the game to the All Blacks, being brave on the ball, keeping the scoreboard ticking and refusing to take a backward step. \u201cLet\u2019s take it to these f***ers,\u201d Sean O\u2019Brien implores the dressing room before the pivotal second Test at Wellington. \u201cDon\u2019t give them any time. Don\u2019t give them any space.\u201d\n\nWill any of this matter once the whistle blows on Saturday? Maybe not. Maybe, as the coaches and number crunchers are always drumming in, it\u2019s simply a case of who executes their skills better on the night. But as England line up in the tunnel on Saturday evening, as they step onto the field, as they face the haka, as the first kick flies through the Tokyo air, they may just feel that little bolt of electricity, the headrush that attends any leap into the unknown.", "description": "\u201cI\u2019d never set eyes on them before.
