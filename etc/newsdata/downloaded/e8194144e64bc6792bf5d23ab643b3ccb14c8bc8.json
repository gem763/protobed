Sinot Yacht Architecture & Design 2019\n\n\"For development of Aqua we took inspiration from the lifestyle of a discerning, forward-looking owner, the fluid versatility of water and cutting-edge technology, to combine this in a 112-meter superyacht with truly innovative features,\" designer Sander Sinot said in a statement shortly before a detailed model of Aqua was revealed at the Monaco Yacht Show in September.\n\n\"Our challenge was to implement fully operational liquid hydrogen and fuel cells in a true superyacht that is not only groundbreaking in technology, but also in design and aesthetics.\"\n\nAqua's technology system will rely on two 28-ton vacuum isolated tanks, which are to be stored at temperatures as low as -253 C.\n\nThe liquified hydrogen is converted into electrical energy by proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells.\n\nRelated content What it's like to own a superyacht\n\nCutting-edge design\n\nl e v a r t\n\nThis energy will then be submitted to the vessel's switchboards and distributed, in order to provide power for propulsion, auxiliary systems and hotel services.\n\nThe exterior and interior design for Aqua, which took developers five months to conceptualize, is almost as impressive as its radical technology system.\n\nRenderings for the futuristic superyacht showcase an on-board infinity pool and heli-pad, along with a spa and swimming pool.\n\nSpread over five decks, Aqua will also has a hydro massage room, a yoga space, a swim platform and a beach deck close to the waterline.\n\nWhile it's just a design concept at the moment, and there are no imminent plans to roll Aqua out, according to Sinot, the pioneering design \"clearly prefigures the superyachts of tomorrow.\"\n\nThe radical vessel design is one of a number of recent developments in the superyacht industry.", "description": "Aqua, a new cutting-edge vessel concept, looks set to propel the superyacht industry into a more eco-friendly direction.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191003100850-hydrogen-powered-superyacht---sinot-aqua-exterior-bow-side-view-super-tease.jpg"}
