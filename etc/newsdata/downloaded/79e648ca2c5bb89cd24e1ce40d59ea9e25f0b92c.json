We\u2019re going through a tough spell, but we put everything out on the pitch and I think we deserved the victory.\n\n\u201cIt is never easy playing with 10 men, so to score again after they equalised was great.\n\n\u201cThen we had the whole of the second half, and that is what a good win feels like.\u201d\n\nAurier was dismissed for two fouls in quick succession both saw referee Graham Scott reaching for his pocket, but Pochettino felt both yellow cards were harsh.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor me it was completely unfair, but it is for me now to talk because I watched the two actions.\n\n\u201cCompletely unfair, but I am not blaming the referee. This type of action happens, today it was against us.\n\n\u201cWhen I watched the two actions, both were not yellow cards. I can say now after we got the three points, but with a different result I would say the same and be honest. It wasn\u2019t a sending-off.\u201d\n\nSouthampton had a spell of pressure after the break, but they did not do enough to deserve an equaliser.\n\nTheir preparations were not helped by the withdrawal of Cedric before kick-off due to an injury.\n\nJannik Vestergaard replaced him in the starting XI, but boss Ralph Hassenhuttl admits he does not know what was wrong with Cedric.\n\nHassenhuttl said: \u201cI don\u2019t know when it happened, it\u2019s not perfect to start a game when you make changes half an hour before kick-off.\n\n\u201cYou prepare everything and then he walks out on the pitch and says he cannot train, I don\u2019t know what happens, it\u2019s not the best preparation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, I haven\u2019t spoken to him yet but I will.\u201d", "description": "Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane believes his side\u2019s gritty win over Southampton shows their character.
