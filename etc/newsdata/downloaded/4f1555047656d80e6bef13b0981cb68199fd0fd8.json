I\u2019m not a fashion guru but looking like the produce section of your local Woolies isn\u2019t what I\u2019d call \u201cstyle\u201d.\n\nThe fruit and veg shop may be a good source of vitamin c, but it shouldn\u2019t be your go-to for fashion advice.\n\nJust like the moment the first Yeezys ever entered our lives, a majority of the internet is sitting here wondering \u201cwhat r those\u201d.\n\nAccording to Sneaker News, the horrendous fruit foam clogs were first spotted on North West, and I\u2019m not about to talk shit on a child, but these shoes are definitely not it.\n\nThe Yeezy Foam Runners look like they\u2019ve been 3D printed straight onto the models\u2019 feet, with no laces or visible zips. So, once you work out how to get this abomination on your foot, good luck ever getting it off.\n\nBut the Yeezy Foam Runners aren\u2019t even the first time somebody tried to make Crocs boujee. No. Balenciaga have a pair of bright pink platform Crocs that retail for a whopping $1,075. Or, alternatively, you could chuck a few hundred dollar bills in your shredder. Your choice.\n\nBut you don\u2019t need to take my word for it, Twitter has been flooded with negative comments about the terrible shoes, or as @JoeJoeColes calls them, \u201cYocs\u201d. Yeezy Foam Runners are NOT a Friday mood.\n\nTrue crocs:\n\nAffordable\n\nEasily customizable\n\nAdjustable strap for sport or leisure mode\n\n10/10 Yeezy crocs:\n\nSuper expensive\n\nWeird diamond shape\n\nProbably can\u2019t even fit jibbitz smh\n\nTerrible idea, 2/10 pic.twitter.com/m7Bqjrv03z \u2014 Josh Brown (@josh_brown_57) September 12, 2019\n\nI didn\u2019t think that anything could be uglier than crocs, but I was wrong. #YeezyCrocs pic.twitter.com/zz01Auqjjw \u2014 Roger (@MissesThe90s) September 13, 2019\n\nSorry Yeez, but this ain\u2019t it. Take your fruit mesh sleeves back to Coles and stop trying to make Crocs happen.", "description": "YeezyMafia announced the new Yeezy Foam Runner on Twitter, but the internet couldnt help but compare the white foam shoes to Crocs.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/pjimage-27.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
