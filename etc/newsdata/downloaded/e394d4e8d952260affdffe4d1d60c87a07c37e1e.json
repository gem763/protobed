MORE isn't inclined to release details on paying for \"Medicare for All,\" Juul is cutting jobs, Senate Democrats are ramping up the pressure on the administration to release its vaping flavor ban, and a federal judge blocked Alabama's abortion law.\n\nWe'll start with the big news in Alabama...\n\nFederal judge temporarily blocks Alabama's near-total abortion ban\n\nA federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked an Alabama abortion law that would have outlawed the procedure in almost all cases.\n\nThe law was one of the strictest abortion bans in the country. It would ban abortion in nearly all instances with no exceptions for rape or incest. Any doctor who performed an abortion would face a sentence of up to 99 years in prison.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJudge Myron Thompson, a Carter appointee, issued the preliminary injunction, which means the state can't enforce the law while it is being challenged in court. But Thompson said the law will \"almost certainly be found unconstitutional.\"\n\nThe decision was expected, and in fact it's likely what advocates of the law were hoping for.\n\nStates have been enacting increasingly strict restrictions on abortions in order for them to be challenged and overturned, in an attempt to get the Supreme Court to revisit Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that established a woman's right to abortion.\n\nWill Alabama's law be that case? Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) said she expects the state's attorney general to challenge Tuesday's ruling. But it's an open question whether the case moves forward. Some experts argue the Supreme Court is unlikely to take up a case that is blatantly unconstitutional.\n\nOther options: If Alabama's abortion ban isn't ripe for Supreme Court review, states like Georgia and Kentucky have passed bans on abortion after 6 weeks of pregnancy, testing court precedent that says states can't ban the procedure before the fetus is viable. Health professionals put fetal viability -- the point at which a baby can survive outside the womb -- at about 24 to 28 weeks.\n\nRead more here.\n\nSanders: 'I don't think I have to' release details on paying for 'Medicare for All'\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) says he will pay for \"Medicare for All.\" He just doesn't think he needs to release more details about how that's going to happen.\n\nDuring a wide-ranging interview with CNBC's John Harwood published Tuesday, Sanders dismissed the idea that he should explain in detail how he'd pay for his signature health plan.\n\n\"You're asking me to come up with an exact detailed plan of how every American -- how much you're going to pay more in taxes, how much I'm going to pay. I don't think I have to do that right now,\" Sanders said.\n\nHis comments come as Sen.

We are therefore deeply troubled that there is no final compliance policy more than six weeks after the Oval Office announcement,\" the senators wrote.\n\nIs Trump backing down? Trump's initial announcement was met with fierce opposition from the vaping industry and conservatives. Health Secretary Alex Azar is now reportedly considering exempting mint and menthol flavors from the ban, amid warnings from Trump's 2020 campaign team that the ban could have negative political ramifications for the president.\n\nRead more here.\n\nJuul cutting jobs, losing top executives\n\nE-cigarette company Juul is cutting between 10 to 15 percent of its workforce amid a major restructuring effort as the company seeks to focus on getting its products through the Food and Drug Administration's review process, the company confirmed.\n\nThe FDA process \"is the best way to assess the role our products can play in helping adult smokers move away from combustible cigarettes while also being kept out of the hands of youth,\" Juul's new CEO K.C. Crosthwaite said.\n\nGovernment affairs, corporate responsibility and clinical and scientific affairs teams will all report directly to Chief Regulatory Officer Joe Murillo going forward -- and will focus on the \"immediate task\" of submitting the company's products for FDA review.\n\nJuul's take: \"Over the past several years, the company has grown at a rapid rate. To right-size the business, the workforce will be reduced between now and the end of the year,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nExecutives leaving: Meanwhile, CNBC reported Juul has replaced Chief Financial Officer Tim Danaher. In addition, Chief Administrative Officer Ashley Gould, Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers and Senior Vice President of Advanced Technologies David Foster all voluntarily left their roles at the e-cigarette manufacturer.\n\nWhat we're reading\n\nSen.
