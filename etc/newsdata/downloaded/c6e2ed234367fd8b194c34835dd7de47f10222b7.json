Sanders is 78.\n\n\u201cI hope there\u2019s an age limit,\u201d Carter said with a laugh as he answered audience questions at his annual report at the Carter Center in Atlanta. \u201cIf I were just 80 years old, if I was 15 years younger, I don\u2019t believe I could undertake the duties I experienced when I was president.\u201d\n\nCarter\u2019s remarks came in response to a jovial inquiry about whether he had considered running in 2020 since he\u2019s still constitutionally allowed another term. The 39th president left office in 1981 at the age of 56 after losing his reelection bid to Ronald Reagan, who served two terms and left office as the oldest sitting president in history, at 77.\n\nEither Biden or Sanders would be older upon their inauguration than Reagan was on his final day in the Oval Office. At 73, President Donald Trump is a record-setter, as well. He eclipsed Reagan\u2019s mark as the oldest newly elected president in history and would become the oldest president to be reelected, as well.\n\nCarter, whose birthday is Oct. 1, said the demands of the Oval Office require a president \u201cto be very flexible with your mind,\u201d particularly on foreign affairs. He was speaking on the 41st anniversary of the Camp David Accords, a peace agreement Carter negotiated with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.\n\n\u201cYou have to be able to go from one subject to another and concentrate on each one adequately, and then put them together in a comprehensive way like I did between Begin and Sadat with the peace agreement,\u201d Carter said.\n\n\u201cThe things I faced in foreign affairs, I don\u2019t think I could undertake them at 80 years old,\u201d he continued, before adding with a smile: \u201cAt 95, it\u2019s out of the question. I\u2019m having a hard time walking.\u201d\n\nCarter said he remains undecided in the 2020 primary, and his assessments on age could leave him with few easy choices.\n\nHe repeated Tuesday his previous disclosure that he voted for Sanders in 2016 over Hillary Clinton, siding with the democratic socialist over the party establishment favorite. But Carter has since warned Democrats not to go too far left, lest they risk alienating independents and moderate Republicans who can help the party defeat Trump in a general election.\n\nHe has cited proposals like a single-payer health care system as potential deal-breakers for some voters inclined to vote against Trump. Sanders and another leading progressive candidate, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, back a single-payer health insurance system run by the federal government.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, is leading most national and early state primary polls in part because of his strength among more moderate Democrats. Other moderates in the field trail far behind Biden, Sanders and Warren.\n\nWhen he ran and won in 1976, Carter was the outsider challenging establishment favorites. But the former Georgia governor also represented the more moderate wing of a party that had been dominated by liberals from the Northeast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ninety-four-year-old former President Jimmy Carter says he doesn't believe he could have managed the most powerful office in the world at 80 years old.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bill Barrow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/03/07/AP_465807040734_c0-157-3130-1981_s1770x1032.jpg?6b711a59fdf69e270bdd92f35808183c18a8a859", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
