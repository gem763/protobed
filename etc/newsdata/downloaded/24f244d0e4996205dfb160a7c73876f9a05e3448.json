We are going to speak about that because the reaction was wrong.\n\n'We are going to speak (about that) inside, with the players and the club.\n\n'We are here because we have supporters. We are the workers inside the club but we play for them.\n\n'We need to have a lot of respect for them when they are applauding us but also when they are criticising us.'\n\nEmery also blasted the decision to disallow what would have been a late winner for the Gunners via VAR.\n\nSokratis rammed home a loose ball to spark wild celebrations, but the goal was eventually ruled out because of a foul from Callum Chambers on Luka Milivojevic.\n\nArsenal boss Unai Emery admitted the skipper was wrong after the final whistle\n\nBut replays show the tangle between Chambers on Milivojevic was far from clear-cut, and Emery added: 'Our goal, the third goal, he is not fouled. That is not a foul. Who is the person who checked that? If the referee watched that action on the TV, I am sure he would not decide that it was a foul.\n\n'In the office with the TV, I don't know who the person is who decides this. (For the referee to view a screen on the side of the pitch) is the next step. We lost two points to that tonight. The next step is that they will check. We have cameras on the pitch, but here I don't remember a single referee going to check on the touchline. I don't remember that.\n\n'VAR is to help the referees, but also to watch or to take the best decision with your own eyes.'\n\nXhaka took his shirt off in frustration as left the pitch during the Premier League clash\n\nPalace boss Roy Hodgson also had to deal with a show of indiscipline from one of his players; Jordan Ayew visibly furious after being replaced by Christian Benteke during the closing stages.\n\nHodgson added: 'I didn't notice particularly, but I would suspect players don't like coming off the field. But often afterwards, after they have settled down they feel it was the right decision.\n\n'I thought the fresh legs was a good idea, and I'm sure if you asked Jordan he would agree with you.\n\n'But if he was upset, I don't hold that against him. I'm really quite pleased. I don't want them to be happy about coming off, I want them to want to stay on the field.'", "description": "SAMI MOKBEL AT THE EMIRATES STADIUM: Unai Emery will hold talks with the Arsenal hierarchy before deciding whether Granit Xhaka will remain as captain.", "authors": ["Sami Mokbel For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/23/20259978-0-image-a-2_1572219236031.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
