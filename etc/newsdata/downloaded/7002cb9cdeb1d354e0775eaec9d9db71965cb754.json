But they have a lot of talent. You can tell they have a lot of fight. Our guys fought back and in the end they had the ability to battle through some of those adverse situations.\u201d\n\nRidder finished 14 of 24 for 263 yards, three touchdowns and an interception. Ridder also had 11 carries for 50 yards and a score.\n\nTrailing 21-10, Houston quarterback Clayton Tune re-energized the home crowd with a career-long 69-yard touchdown pass to Marquez Stevenson to start the second half.\n\nThe Cougars (2-4, 0-2) cut the lead to five with 9:09 left on Tune\u2019s 6-yard pass to Christian Trahan, but it wasn\u2019t enough to prevent Houston\u2019s first 0-2 start in conference play since 2002, when the Cougars were in Conference USA.\n\n\u201cCame up short,\u201d Houston coach Dana Holgorsen said. \u201cWe had a chance to win in the fourth quarter. A couple of bad calls I thought prevented us from being able to get the ball back and go score. It is what it is, you have to deal with it.\n\n\u201cSome bright spots but overall just happy with the guys and the way they played. Happy with the way they fought. Nobody\u2019s happy about 2-4 and we\u2019ve lost to four pretty good teams and we expect to be a good team as well.\u201d\n\nTune finished 9 of 27 for 184 yards, two touchdowns and three interceptions.\n\n\u201cI thought Clayton, for not repping for two weeks, actually hung in there and did some good things,\u201d Holgorsen said. \u201cHe\u2019s our starting quarterback.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nCincinnati: A week after forcing four turnovers against Central Florida and limiting the Knights to their fewest points in 2019, Cincinnati\u2019s defense shined again. The Bearcats had four interceptions to run their season total to 13 and forced a fumble to help hold Houston to a season-low 23 points.\n\nHouston: With D\u2019Eriq King redshirting the rest of the season, Houston has been seeking his permanent replacement for this year. Tune, Bryson Smith and Logan Holgorsen all got playing time. Tune started, Smith was brought in to run the wildcat formation and Holgorsen got his first playing time in the first quarter.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nCincinnati should move up with No. 23 Memphis losing to Temple on Saturday and No. 20 Virginia losing to Miami on Friday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCincinnati: The Bearcats return home Oct. 19 to face Tulsa.\n\nHouston: The Cougars travel to UConn on Oct. 19 for the teams\u2019 first meeting since 2016.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Desmond Ridder passed for 263 yards and three touchdowns and No. 25 Cincinnati held off Houston's late surge to beat the Cougars 38-23 on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joshua Koch"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/cincinnati_houston_football_57871_c0-461-3100-2269_s1200x700.jpg?d6611361b344e1ad68ecce9180cb2d2fbe7bc2bd", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
