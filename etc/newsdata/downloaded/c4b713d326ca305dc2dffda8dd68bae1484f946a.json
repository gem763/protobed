They have not long been married and she\u2019s just had a baby.\n\n\u2018They need a couple of months to go away to be a normal family.\u2019\n\nRuth then argued: \u2018They are not a normal family though.\u2019\n\n\u2018Meghan enjoys the press when it\u2019s helping her charity or doing something she\u2019s passionate about,\u2019 Ruth continued. \u2018And then there\u2019s the argument of \u201cyou can\u2019t have it both ways\u201d.\u2019\n\nThe discussion certainly got Loose Women viewers talking as many of them took to social media to share their thoughts.\n\nOne viewer tweeted: \u2018Just let Harry & Meghan have time to let their lives settle down. Give them time to heal.\u2019\n\nAnother commented: \u2018Leave Meghan and Harry alone. can understand where your both coming from. But I can understand more about her not wanting to be around it all when all she gets is full-on hated by the UK. She\u2019s targeted more than any other royal, we love Meghan.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne added: \u2018Wow, the Meghan debate on #loosewomen really has divided opinions. Even in this household. She didn\u2019t marry into the Royal family for the job, she married Harry. Other celebrities can promote their work and block their private life out so why can\u2019t Meghan. This world is so sad.\u2019\n\nAnother tweeted: \u2018Just because she lives a lavish life it doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t have an opinion and express how she is feeling. As was said on the show, stop trying to force Meghan to be something or someone she is no.\u2019\n\nAnother viewer tweeted: \u2018I completely agree that people expect Meghan to fit a mould that she can never fit. She\u2019s an incredible woman and we should be proud to have someone who is so passionate and independent representing the women of Britain/America without slagging her off all the time!\u2019\n\nLoose Women airs weekdays at 12.30pm on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
