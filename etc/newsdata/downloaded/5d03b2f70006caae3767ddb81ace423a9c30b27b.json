That\u2019s bigger than the populations of U.S. cities such as Austin and San Jose, Calif.\n\nCBP also seized more than 100,000 pounds of cocaine, nearly 2,800 pounds of deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl, and nearly 3,000 illegal weapons \u2014 each of those an increase compared to 2018.\n\nMr. Morgan said that was all the more impressive because it came amid the disruptions of the border surge, when as many as 40% of Border Patrol agents were pulled off the line to perform babysitting duties such as driving and feeding illegal immigrant families and children.\n\nMr. Morgan said President Trump\u2019s wall-building campaign kicked into gear in 2019, with 76 miles of replacement fence now done, another 156 miles under construction \u2014 including some newly fenced areas \u2014 and 276 miles in \u201cpreconstruction.\u201d\n\nThe flow of people across the border now is dramatically different than earlier this year.\n\nSome migrants who earlier may have jumped the border illegally, confident of exploiting loopholes to gain a foothold in the U.S., are now showing up at ports of entry to make claims of admission \u2014 a process that is legal.\n\nMore than one in five unauthorized border crossers came to the port of entry last month, compared to less than 8% in May, the record month for illegal family migration.\n\nAn increasing percentage of those crossers are Mexican families, and agents also are seeing more Brazilians attempting to enter without authorization, Mr. Morgan said.\n\n\u201cI always say this kind of tongue-in-cheek, but I\u2019m serious, that the Mexican cartels and the human smuggling organizations really should teach a business class at Harvard,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery single time we attack the current tactics \u2026 they change and develop new ones.\u201d\n\nIn this case, he said, that means the cartels who just months ago were advertising in Central America, draining some regions of nearly 3% of their population as they headed north, are now running similar ads in Mexico.\n\nYet even as Mexican cartels create new challenges, Mexico\u2019s government has been instrumental in helping curb the surge of Central Americans who fueled the border crisis.\n\nOne critical bit of help has come from the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy, which takes would-be asylum seekers from other countries who cross Mexico en route to the U.S. Under the policy, begun in January, many of those people can now be pushed back across the border and made to wait in Mexico while their asylum claims are judged.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security says the Migration Protection Protocols, as the program is officially known, has been a singular success.\n\nOf the 55,000 migrants subject to MPP, only a \u201csmall subset\u201d have won their cases and been readmitted to the U.S. to proceed with asylum claims.\n\nAnother 20,000 are still waiting in northern Mexico, Homeland Security officials believe. But that leaves tens of thousands who are believed to have given up their claims.\n\nJust as important are the would-be migrants who have not made the trip in the first place, Homeland Security said, cutting the number of illegal immigrant families nabbed at the U.S.-Mexico border by 80% from its record high in May.\n\nThe program is also more fair to the migrants, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said, since they can get a final hearing and learn their fate within a few months, rather than the years-long backlog for those stuck in the U.S. immigration courts.\n\nThe MPP, which began in a few select locations on the border, expanded this week to Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\n\u201cWe have already seen individuals granted asylum, and many more fraudulent or non-meritorious cases closed,\u201d Mr. McAleenan said.\n\nUnder the old system, asylum-seekers had been allowed to enter the U.S. and roamed free, with few of them returning to be deported when the time came.\n\nNow they are denied that foothold and allowed entry only after they pass the first asylum hurdles.\n\nThe theory behind the program is that if someone from a country other than Mexico travels through Mexico, they could claim asylum there, and their continued journey to the U.S. suggests they are regular illegal immigrants seeking jobs or to reunite with families. Neither of those is considered a reason for asylum under the law.\n\nMPP has drawn fierce criticism from immigrant-rights activists who say the policy has created dangerous conditions in northern Mexico, with migrant camps making easy prey for criminals.\n\nActivists have filed several lawsuits, drawing federal judges into the fray, and they are scrutinizing the policy.\n\nSeveral judges have indicated the policy may need to have more protections for those who, despite coming from other countries, fear being left in Mexico.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
