Having sex with anyone under the age of 15 is considered statutory rape.\n\nAccording to local paper Walliser Bote, the girl, who was not present in court for the hearing, said: 'The morning after you ripped the clothes off my body and forced yourself into me with your violent actions, I woke up completely confused and did not know why my body hurt so much.'\n\nShe was advised not to appear in court in Visp, Switzerland, by a psychologist.\n\nThe prosecutor is pushing for a four-year jail sentence and a ten-year-ban from Switzerland.\n\nThe girl's father has said the proposed sentence is too short. He told the court: '48 months for my daughter's rapist is too little. It has ruined her life as well as the life of our family.'\n\nThe alleged rape happened on the night of December 19, 2018. The teenager went to the hotel bar at around 9pm and ordered an alcoholic drink.\n\nAfter serving her without checking her ID, it is alleged that he continued to serve her free drinks all evening.\n\nHe is then accused of kissing her on the cheek before passionately kissing her on the lips.\n\nAccording to reports the girl had so many drinks that she could hardly stand up.\n\nThe barman claims that she said she was 20 and that the sex was consensual.

The owner called the police. But there were no witnesses to the alleged rape.\n\nIn court, the man apologised to the girl but said the sex was consensual.\n\nHe admits he should have asked for her ID and claimed she told him she was 20 years old.\n\nHe said she was 'all made up' and looked 20.\n\nThe public prosecutor sees it differently and called the man a 'gigolo' and say he acted in his own interests, according to reports.\n\nThe case continues and the verdict is due in a few weeks.\n\nNeither the suspect nor the alleged victim have been named due to local privacy laws.", "description": "The 55-year-old barman is accused of giving the girl free alcoholic drinks all night without checking her ID.
