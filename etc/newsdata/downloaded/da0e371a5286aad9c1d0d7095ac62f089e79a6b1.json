Turns out I'm pretty good if you give me more than three months.\"\n\nStill, KSI claimed to be a cross between Vasyl Lomachenko and Mike Tyson so maybe there's hope yet.", "description": "YouTube stars KSI and Logan Paul will go head-to-head in their rematch in Los Angeles on November 9", "authors": ["Martin Domin", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20532941.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_KSI-Logan-Paul-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
