It\u2019s one of the components of the game that the players and fans enjoy.\u201d\n\nMatch officials in Japan continue to face strident criticism, with coaches picking up on inconsistency in implementing World Rugby protocols on safer tackling in particular.\n\nBut Hansen said World Rugby were playing their role in opening up debate over the tackle area, underlining that it was now the responsibility of coaches and players to adapt better to the new regulations.\n\n\u201cA couple of people have been very seriously injured in tackles and in some cases actually passed away,\u201d Hansen said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not leading if you\u2019re not looking at that and World Rugby are meant to be leaders of the game so they\u2019ve looked at it and decided this is the way to go.\u201d\n\nHansen, who led the All Blacks to World Cup victory in 2015 having previously helped Graham Henry to glory four years previously, added: \u201cHave we got it 100 percent right? No.\n\n\u201cBut it is what World Rugby have asked us to do and as keepers, players and coaches of the game, then we\u2019ve got a responsibility to try to respond to that and do it the best we can. I think you always find a balance.\u201d\n\nAll Black forwards Nepo Laulala and Ofa Tuungafasi were both yellow carded in their team\u2019s 71-9 victory over Namibia for high tackles.\n\nWhile admitting that both cards were justified, Hansen added that New Zealand were working on how to deal with a ball carrier falling over in the tackle.\n\n\u201cUnder the guidelines, the yellow cards were fair. But the game is incredibly difficult under those guidelines when players are falling at your feet,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe rules aren\u2019t going to change, so we have to accept that and get on the best we can and adapt and adjust quicker than we have.\u201d\n\nHansen added that it was more than feasible, as pool play comes to an end this week, for a big game in the knock-out phase to be decided by a call on a high tackle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say so, but we all know what the guidelines are and we\u2019ve all got to work harder. There\u2019s no point moaning about it, it\u2019s about accepting and getting on with it.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Rugby union remains a sport of \u201cintimidation\u201d, All Blacks coach Steve Hansen insisted Monday amid a slew of yellow and red", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/5f7799_rugby-is-physical-game-stresses-hansen-rugby-sport-intimidation-all-blacks-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
