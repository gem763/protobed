But most analysts say the scope for aggressive stimulus is limited in an economy already saddled with piles of debt following previous easing cycles, which have sent housing prices sharply higher.\n\n** \"Given exports are unlikely to stage a comeback and a possible slowdown in the property sector, the downward pressure on China's economy is likely to continue, with fourth-quarter economic growth expected to slip to 5.9%,\" Hwabao Trust economist Nie Wen said.\n\n** \"Authorities will loosen policies, but in a more restrained way.\"\n\n** Some argued the latest data was not that unexpected.\n\n** The miss of the GDP growth rate in the third quarter is not that big, as China's economy remains in a downward trend, which could prompt the central government to roll out more stimulative measures to underpin the economy, Zhang Gang, analyst with Central Securities said.\n\n** Focus still remains on the progress of the proposed Sino-U.S. trade deal.\n\n** China hopes to reach a phased agreement in the trade dispute with the United States and cancel tariffs as soon as possible, the Commerce Ministry said on Thursday, adding that trade wars had no winners.\n\n** Sectors fell across the board for the day, led down by real estate and infrastructure firms.\n\n** Around the region, MSCI's Asia ex-Japan stock index was weaker by 0.29%, while Japan's Nikkei index closed up 0.18%.\n\n** At 0704 GMT, the yuan was quoted at 7.0849 per U.S. dollar, 0.11% weaker than the previous close of 7.0772.\n\n** So far this year, the Shanghai stock index is up 17.8% and the CSI300 has risen 28.5%, while China's H-share index listed in Hong Kong is up 4.1%. Shanghai stocks have risen 1.13% this month.\n\n** As of 07:05 GMT, China's A-shares were trading at a premium of 28.84% over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares.
