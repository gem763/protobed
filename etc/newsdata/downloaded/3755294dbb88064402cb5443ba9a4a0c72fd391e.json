Nearly all the company\u2019s North American plants are shut down, with nearly 50,000 hourly workers off the job. The strike is costing GM tens of millions of dollars a day.\n\nAutomotive News reported that if the strike continues through the weekend, GM will have lost $660 million in profit, citing Anderson Economic Group. JPMorgan has estimated it could cost the company $1 billion during the third quarter.\n\nAs days without production mount, so do worries about the automaker\u2019s third- and fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nInvestors are starting to do the math \u201con the trade-offs between the upfront pain of lost profit and cash flow vs. potential concessions to the union that could impact GM competitiveness longer-term,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a note to investors this week.\n\nGM Stock Down\n\nGM stock closed at $34.91 Friday, down from more than $38 on the last trading day before the strike in mid-September.\n\nThe union and company are trying to work out disagreements over health care costs, temporary workers and the level of domestic production \u2014 as well as wage increases.\n\nThe entire auto industry is watching closely. The UAW contract also will have to be negotiated at other automakers, and they are likely to wait until after the GM issues are resolved.\n\nKristin Dziczek, vice president of the Center for Automotive Research, this week told analysts at UBS that there\u2019s a lower risk of a strike at Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), which is slated to enter talks next with the UAW.\n\nBut Dziczek said she saw a 50% strike risk for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE: FCAU), given tougher issues with that automaker, according to UBS.\n\nSuppliers are also feeling the effects. Canadian auto parts maker Linamar, for example, said the walkout is costing it CA$1 million ($750,300) per day.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nUAW Declares Strike Against GM For First Time Since 2007\n\nGeneral Motors Strike In Detroit Causes Factories To Shut Down In Mexico\n\nLatest Ratings for GM\n\nDate Firm Action From To Oct 2019 Maintains Buy Oct 2019 Maintains Overweight Aug 2019 Maintains Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for GM\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
