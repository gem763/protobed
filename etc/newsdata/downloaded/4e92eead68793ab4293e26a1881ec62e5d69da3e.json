I went downstairs to find Cuc (Cuchulain) in the kitchen supervising our daughter eating her breakfast.\n\n\"He put our daughter in front of the TV and I sat down with her. A minute later I heard a moan, the only way I can describe it is like a wounded animal.\n\n\"We had two dogs so I thought they were playing, I shouted through to them to \u201cpack it up\u201d.\n\n\"Seconds went by and my stomach dropped, I felt the dread I should\u2019ve felt earlier, I shouted 'what?' No reply \u201c'what?'\n\n\"Again, the feeling of dread got stronger so I ran up the stairs. That\u2019s when my life changed. I found Cuc in Preston\u2019s bedroom door cradling our baby, fighting back tears, time had stopped.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I screamed, screamed like I\u2019d never screamed before and ran down the stairs still screaming and grabbed the phone from the dock at the bottom and dialled 999.\n\n\"When the operator answered everything was in slow motion and she was asking what service I needed.\n\n\"I was confused so I screamed \u201call of them, please help me, my baby is dead\u201d\n\n\"She asked me to take the phone upstairs, I didn\u2019t want to because I didn\u2019t want to see my baby gone, all I\u2019d seen was the back of his head before that but I ran the phone upstairs and found Cuc in our bedroom trying to revive Preston but it was obvious we were too late, he was grey, I fell to my knees and felt like I\u2019d died the most painful death.\"\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nIt wasn't until Lisa was in hospital she found out how her baby had died.\n\n\"When we identified Preston he looked so peaceful, for a second I thought he was asleep.\n\n\"I bent down and stroked his head, I begged him to wake up and we could go home, \" said Lisa.\n\n\"I stroked his hair, I remember touching him and he felt empty, I could feel the life that was inside of him was gone.\n\n\"That night I couldn\u2019t stay at home, I stayed with a friend and I vowed I would make some good come from this, when I got home I opened the laptop and Googled \u201ccot bumper deaths\u201d there was loads, I felt sick, if I\u2019d have done that sooner Preston would be here now.\n\n\"That\u2019s when I made this page , there was no time to lose and I knew bumpers were on cots all around the world, I needed to reach people immediately and that\u2019s what we did.\n\n\"Six years later Preston\u2019s death wasn\u2019t in vain, he died for a reason. Advice has changed, laws have changed all because we stood up.\n\n\"Despite the changes made babies have still died, unnecessarily.\"", "description": "Since Preston's tragic death, Lisa Gee has devoted her life to raising awareness and warning other parents about the dangers of cot bumpers", "authors": ["Emma Grimshaw", "Danya Bazaraa", "Image", "Lisa Marie", "Daily Mirror", "Mirrorpix"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20661043.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Little-Preston.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
