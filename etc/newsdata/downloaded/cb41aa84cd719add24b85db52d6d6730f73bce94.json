(AP) - The erratic play of Maryland\u2019s defense has proven to be more of a problem for first-year coach Mike Locksley than losing his starting quarterback to injury.\n\nTyrrell Pigrome ran for a 61-yard score and threw for 218 yards at Purdue last Saturday as the replacement for Josh Jackson , who was out with high ankle sprain. Unfortunately, the Boilermakers amassed 547 yards and walloped the Terrapins 40-14 .\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t play great team defense,\u201d Locksley acknowledged Tuesday. \u201cWe missed a lot of tackles and we didn\u2019t play with the energy our defense has displayed throughout the course of the season.\u201d\n\nThe Terrapins (3-3, 1-2 Big Ten) opened with a shutout of Howard and entered the Purdue game coming off a 48-7 rout of Rutgers. But Maryland also gave up 59 points to Penn State and stumbled mightily against Purdue, which moved the chains on 11 of 18 third-down attempts - including conversions of 11, 13 and 23 yards that left Locksley shaking his head.\n\n\u201cThere are times when we play really, really good on defense, and there are times when we look really, really bad,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get rid of the inconsistency.\u201d\n\nHe can only hope that Maryland\u2019s defense - currently ranked 11th in the 14-team conference - can get it right Saturday against Indiana (4-2, 1-2). The Hoosiers are averaging 33.3 points per game and rank second in the Big Ten in yards passing behind Purdue.\n\nThe Terrapins will be without senior defensive back Tino Ellis, who is out for the year with an upper body injury after starting the first six games. Ellis started all 12 games last season and was honorable mention Big Ten.\n\nEven before Ellis was removed from the mix, Maryland was relying heavily two true freshmen, defensive backs Deonte Banks and Lavonte Gater.\n\n\u201cWe were getting beat with slants, which are fundamental issues that we\u2019ll get cleaned up and get fixed,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cThe more experience those guys get, the better we\u2019ll be.\u201d\n\nLocksley has no intention of re-writing the game plan to accommodate an ever-changing starting lineup.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to attack. We\u2019ve got to be aggressive up front,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a big interior defensive line group, so to sit back and play zone defense (won\u2019t work). The quickest way to get beat is to allow people to run the ball.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the best player on Maryland\u2019s defense is safety Antoine Brooks Jr., who leads the Big Ten with 5.8 solo tackles per game and ranks second on the Terps with 38 tackles overall.\n\nBrooks usually roams the field while focusing on taking out the ball carrier, but opposing teams have been making it harder for him to be a factor.\n\n\u201cOne of the things people have done to us to negate Antoine Brooks is they\u2019ve spread us out, so he\u2019s not close to the box where he has been able to create a lot of issues for people on offense,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cWe\u2019re making some adjustments there to keep him in the game.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The erratic play of Maryland's defense has proven to be more of a problem for first-year coach Mike Locksley than losing his starting quarterback to injury.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Ginsburg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/maryland_purdue_football_18934_c0-0-3190-1860_s1200x700.jpg?f59359d25afa35867822f1a61af22110144744c1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
