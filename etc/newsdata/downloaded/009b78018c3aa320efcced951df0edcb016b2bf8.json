The company plans to debut in the U.K. within the next 12-18 months, followed by 20 or so company-operated restaurants in the country quickly thereafter.\n\nFrom there, Penegor intends to build out the European market before first considering a foray into China \u2014 which he says is a \u201clittle further out.\u201d Penegor thinks Wendy\u2019s could reach $2 billion in sales and 1,500 restaurants overseas by 2024, up from $1 billion in sales and 900 or so restaurants currently.\n\nWendys gave fans the ultimate fresh beef and bacon experience at Chicagos Daley Plaza Farmers Market with a 15-foot-tall Baconator dome September 1, 2016 in Chicago, Illinois.

It has a lot of brand equity across all of Europe. There are a lot of social followers across all of Europe on Twitter. We are already looking to partner with some big partners to help bring the brand to life beyond the U.K. into Europe,\u201d Penegor tells Yahoo Finance.\n\nIndeed, Wendy\u2019s will face some formidable competition in the U.K. from McDonald\u2019s, Domino\u2019s Pizza and KFC. The same competition also awaits Wendy\u2019s in Europe and of course, China.\n\nBut as long as the Baconator is on the menu, Wendy\u2019s succeeding internationally must not be ruled out.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
