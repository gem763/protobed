Microsoft has handled moderation on Xbox Live for almost 20 years, including the ability to report messages, Gamertags, photos, and much more, but this new effort places the player in control of what they will see on Xbox Live. At first, Microsoft is rolling out text-based filters for messages on Xbox Live, but the company has a much broader goal of being able to filter out Xbox Live party sessions in the future so live audio calls could be filtered with real-time bleeps similar to broadcast TV.\n\nThere will be four new levels of text-based filtration available to Xbox Live users initially: Friendly, Medium, Mature, and Unfiltered. As you might imagine, Friendly is the most child-friendly option, designed to filter out all potentially offensive messages. At the opposite end, there\u2019s Unfiltered, which will work as Xbox Live messaging mostly works today.\n\nThe context of messages is key\n\nFiltered messages will appear with a new \u201cpotentially offensive hidden message\u201d warning on them, and if you\u2019re using an adult Xbox Live account, you\u2019ll be able to click through to see the content and report it using the regular tools if need be. Child accounts will be placed into the Friendly level by default, and they\u2019ll be blocked by default from seeing potentially offensive messages. Parents will be able to manage the levels through Microsoft\u2019s family settings, and the filtering will work across Xbox One, Xbox Game Bar, and the Xbox apps for Windows 10, iOS, and Android.\n\nFor Microsoft, this isn\u2019t just about filtering out the bad stuff people might send to you while you\u2019re playing the latest Call of Duty title. It goes much deeper. \u201cYou see stories of African American players being called out for lynching in multiplayer sessions, or female gamers in competitive environments being called all sorts of names and feeling harassed in the outside world, or members of our LGBTQ community feeling like they can\u2019t speak with their voice on Xbox Live for fear that they\u2019ll be called out,\u201d explains Dave McCarthy, head of Microsoft\u2019s Xbox operations, in an interview with The Verge. \u201cIf we really are to realize our potential as an industry and have this wonderful medium come to everybody, there\u2019s just no place for that.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy and his team have been looking at various ways to identify the context of messages using a mix of artificial intelligence and filtering. \u201cContext is a really tricky thing in the gaming space,\u201d admits McCarthy. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say you\u2019re going to go on a killing spree when you\u2019re getting ready for a multiplayer mission in Halo, and it\u2019s another when that\u2019s uttered in another setting. Finding ways for us to understand context and nuance is a never-ending battle.\u201d\n\nI spent part of my meeting with McCarthy and his team in one of the more bizarre moments of my career: bombarding an Xbox Live account with rude messages in an attempt to beat the filters. I tried some of the basic ways to get around typical text filters by manipulating swear words with accents or symbols, and Microsoft caught them. Even context-based messages about murdering waves of zombies were picked up correctly. I didn\u2019t have enough time to test the system fully, but nothing is foolproof, and the internet can quickly adapt to create offensive phrases and memes that attack certain communities. Microsoft demonstrated how it could take a particular phrase and instantly add it to the company\u2019s filtering system, although someone would still need to flag this word in the first place.\n\nMicrosoft is now trying to be more open and transparent about how it moderates Xbox Live and the choices it makes to enforce these filters across the community. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to ask our users to be accountable for their actions on Xbox Live and our other services, we need to be transparent about our value system, our practices, and why we do what we do,\u201d explains McCarthy. \u201cWe\u2019ve had success recently in doing things like providing evidence, and pointing people back to our new Xbox Live community standards, as part of our transparency effort around investigations we do.\u201d\n\nAt present, Xbox Live users can dig into the company\u2019s enforcement website to ultimately find hints about what specific message got their account into trouble. But it\u2019s not the same as highlighting the bad behavior in a message to the person responsible for the account. Microsoft is considering some changes to how Xbox Live owners are notified when they break the rules, but the company is also looking far beyond just text-based messages.\n\nMicrosoft also wants to tackle the challenge of voice chat toxicity on Xbox Live. A lot of toxic behavior and harassment can occur when someone is invited into an Xbox Live party chat. Microsoft Research has already developed speech-to-text capabilities to translate audio in real time, and the Xbox division is looking at using this.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve started to experiment with is \u2018Hey, if we\u2019re real-time translating speech to text, and we\u2019ve got these text filtering capabilities, what can we do in terms of blocking possible communications in a voice setting?\u2019\u201d explains McCarthy. \u201cIt\u2019s early days there, and there are a myriad of other AI and technology that we\u2019re looking to stack around the voice problem, things like emotion detection and context detection that we can apply there. I think we\u2019re learning overall... we\u2019re taking our time with this to do it right.\u201d\n\nAudio chats could be filtered with bleeps like TV\n\nThat\u2019s obviously hugely complex, both in terms of the technology to achieve it and also the privacy aspects involved, but Microsoft\u2019s goal is to have something similar to the filtering that TV stations can achieve on live broadcasts.\n\n\u201cAn ultimate goal could be similar to what you\u2019d expect on broadcast TV where people are having a conversation, and in real time, we\u2019re able to detect a bad phase and beep it out for users who don\u2019t want to see that,\u201d explains Rob Smith, a program manager on the Xbox Live engineering team. \u201cIt\u2019s a great goal, but we\u2019re going to have to take steps towards that.\u201d Microsoft will also have to consider any potential latency around analyzing voice samples in real time, as most party chat is used to coordinate in-game moves.\n\nIt sounds like before any automated audio filtering, Microsoft is looking at analyzing party chat speech to detect toxicity. \u201cIn the meantime, we could do things like analyzing a person\u2019s speech and figuring out, overall, what\u2019s their level of toxicity they\u2019re using in this session? And maybe doing things like automatically muting them,\u201d reveals Smith.\n\nMicrosoft is running a variety of tests internally to figure out what will work best and to consult its Xbox Live community on implementing its party chat plans. It\u2019s an ambitious plan, but Microsoft will have to be very careful in how it analyzes this audio as the privacy implications are huge. \u201cWe have to respect privacy requirements at the end of the day for our users, so we\u2019ll step into it in a thoughtful manner, and transparency will be our guiding principle to have us do the right thing for our gamers,\u201d says McCarthy.\n\nMicrosoft could also find itself in a free speech debate with these filters, even though the Supreme Court affirmed earlier this year that First Amendment rights don\u2019t apply to private platforms like Xbox Live. Microsoft is being clear about its intentions here and what it expects from a community it ultimately controls.\n\n\u201cXbox Live is not a free speech platform. It is a curated community where we want you to have some degrees of personal freedom in that, which is why we\u2019re doing four different settings to start here,\u201d explains McCarthy. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want to be ambiguous about what we stand for. This has to be a place where everyone has fun, and everything we do feature-wise and moderation practice-wise is going to vector across that set of values.\u201d", "description": "Microsoft is adding new text and voice filters to Xbox Live.
