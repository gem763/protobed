'How the linesman on that side can\u2019t say something.\n\n'The ref gesticulates to the linesman then puts the thumbs up. How they both can come to that conclusion is just amazing.'\n\nMeanwhile, Brazilian midfielder Fred endured yet another poor night in a United shirt. Solskjaer played the \u00a352million signing and in his chance to impress the boss, Fred failed to deliver, losing the ball on multiple occasions.\n\nFred was lucky to evade punishment for a clumsy push on an AZ Alkmaar opponent\n\nUnited were fortunate to evade any punishment when the 26-year-old looked to have brought down an Alkmaar attacker during a corner routine. Again, the referee waved away appeals.\n\n'(Was it a penalty?) Yes definitely, that would have compounded a real miserable night for Fred.\n\n'First hand goes on then the second, it\u2019s because he\u2019s not concentrating, he\u2019s looking at the ball. I thought it was a penalty.'\n\nUnited have picked up four points from their opening two games in Group L as they look to win the Europa League again after Jose Mourinho's triumph in 2017.", "description": "The England international had run into the box before cutting back on the ball when was brought down by Stijn Wuytens in the 0-0 draw at the Kyocera Stadium in their Europa League contest.", "authors": ["Ollie Lewis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/21/19269094-0-image-a-2_1570134934744.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
