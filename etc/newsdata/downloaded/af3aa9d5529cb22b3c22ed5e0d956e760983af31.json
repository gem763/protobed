Flowers' first penalty came during a 3rd-and-10 play where the Lions sacked Rodgers. Green Bay likely would've punted, but the penalty resulted in an automatic first down to keep the drive alive.\n\nFlowers was called for another illegal hands to the face penalty on Green Bay's final drive. This penalty crept the Packers closer to the end zone, and kicker Mason Crosby eventually converted a 23-yard field goal as time expired to seal a 1-point Green Bay win.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNFL Twitter, including several current and former players, were not pleased (or at least were confused) with the officiating. One of those players was Patriots linebacker Dont'a Hightower, who played with Flowers for three seasons. Here's a collection of notable Twitter reaction to the penalties on Flowers:\n\nIdk bout that.... \ud83d\udc40 \u2014 Dont'a Hightower (@zeus30hightower) October 15, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nThe refs need to be investigated. This is horrendous. Check bank accounts. #NoExcuses \u2014 Desmond Howard (@DesmondHoward) October 15, 2019\n\nOH MY GOD THE REFS LOST THE LIONS A GAME!!! \u2014 Chris Long (@JOEL9ONE) October 15, 2019\n\nThat is sickening... the @NFL needs to look at a way to prevent that from happening. Two phantom hands to the face calls really hurts us tonight. Yes, we could have scored TDs, but @Lions played too well to have the game end this way. #DETvsGB @espn \u2014 Barry Sanders (@BarrySanders) October 15, 2019\n\nIn my 11 years involved with the NFL, I've never seen worse officiating than this year and it's not even close. \u2014 TJ Lang (@TJLang70) October 15, 2019\n\nThere is no explanation.

Al Riveron continues to blindly side with his refs and the current status quo. Something must change! Zero accountability. ...#throughthewire \u2014 Clay Matthews III (@ClayMatthews52) October 15, 2019\n\nThe bogus personal foul and the non call Pass Interference was six more points. Four wrong calls is hard to imagine. https://t.co/GUoT0h7JV4 \u2014 Tony Dungy (@TonyDungy) October 15, 2019\n\nGreen Bay can thank the refs for that touchdown \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 Reggie Bush (@ReggieBush) October 15, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
