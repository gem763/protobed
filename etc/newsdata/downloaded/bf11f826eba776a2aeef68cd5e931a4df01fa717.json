The message comes after Blizzard caught fire this week for banning a professional Hearthstone player for shouting a statement associated with Hong Kong protesters.\n\n\u201cEpic supports everyone\u2019s right to express their views on politics and human rights. We wouldn\u2019t ban or punish a Fortnite player or content creator for speaking on these topics,\u201d an Epic Games spokesperson told The Verge.\n\nOver the weekend, Blizzard banned Hearthstone player Ng \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Wai Chung from participating in tournaments after he voiced support for the protesters in Hong Kong. In a post-game interview on Sunday, Blitzchung said, \u201cLiberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our age!\u201d Now, he cannot participate in any tournaments for an entire year (effective October 5th), and Blizzard is withholding any prize money he would have received in the Grandmasters tournament over the weekend. Those forfeited winnings have been reported to total around $10,000.\n\nIn an interview with AFP, Blitzchung said, \u201cI don\u2019t regret saying that stuff. And even now, I don\u2019t regret it at all.\u201d\n\nBlizzard responded to the criticism saying in a statement that it stands \u201cby one\u2019s right to express individual thoughts and opinions,\u201d but Blitzchung violated a competition rule that prohibits players from doing anything that would bring \u201c[them] into public disrepute,\u201d offend \u201ca portion or group of the public,\u201d or damage Blizzard\u2019s image.\n\nFollowing Blizzard\u2019s decision, the company\u2019s own forums and subreddits dedicated to its games ballooned with messages from angry fans condemning the ban. The r/Blizzard subreddit went down for a few hours on Tuesday after the board was overrun with memes and posts calling for players to boycott Blizzard and its games like World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and Hearthstone.\n\nSenators on both sides of the aisle have also taken notice, tweeting out statements criticizing Blizzard\u2019s move. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) said, \u201cBlizzard shows it is willing to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d He continued, \u201cNo American company should censor calls for freedom to make a quick buck.\u201d", "description": "Blizzard banned Hearthstone player Ng \"Blitzchung\" Wai Chung from participating in tournaments after he voiced support for the protesters in Hong Kong.
