An RFEF source said the governing body was following the matter with concern although it was an issue between the clubs and the players.\n\nThe ACFF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Top-flight women footballers in Spain are going on strike indefinitely from Nov. 16 over a disagreement about pay and conditions, the Association of Spanish Footballers (AFE) said on Monday.", "authors": ["Rik Sharma", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
