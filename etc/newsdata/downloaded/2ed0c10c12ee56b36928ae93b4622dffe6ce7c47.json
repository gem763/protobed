The attendees, who included such right-wing Internet luminaries as Diamond and Silk and former White House aide Sebastian Gorka, were even treated to a vintage diatribe against the mainstream press: \u201cThe media says \u2014 the establishment media, the fake media \u2014 they say, \u2018Aww, there\u2019s no censorship in social media! That\u2019s all made up, that\u2019s all fake.\u2019 You and I know that\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nIt was classic Trump. Only it wasn\u2019t Trump. That last bit was delivered by Josh Hawley, a 39-year-old Republican freshman senator from Missouri who has quickly become the face of the conservative side of the backlash against Silicon Valley. Half a year into his first term, he has introduced a raft of legislation aimed at cracking down on some of the business practices of giants like Facebook and Google. And, somewhat improbably for a Republican senator who often speaks in the language of Trumpian grievance, much of this legislation has been bipartisan. In March, he teamed up with Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) on a bill to strengthen online privacy protections for children; then in May, he partnered with Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) on the Do Not Track Act, which would let users opt out of having their data mined.\n\nAll of this has earned Hawley accolades from across the aisle, even though the bills stand little chance of becoming law anytime soon, and some of them strike experts as clunky and overbroad. (A measure he introduced in late July \u2014 the Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology Act \u2014 reads like a parody of hyper-regulation: \u201c[T]he operator shall present the user with an option to decline by clicking an icon that is identical to the other icon in terms of size, shape, font, and other visual or auditory design.\u201d) Feinstein told me that she and Hawley are \u201cboth advocates for individual control of personal data.\u201d Warner said, \u201cIt\u2019s great to work with a Republican partner who is thinking deeply about these issues.\u201d And Markey called Hawley \u201ca tenacious privacy advocate.\u201d\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) questioning William Barr during the attorney general's confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in January. (Carolyn Kaster/Associated Press)\n\nThe senator from Missouri \u2014 a devout Christian conservative and former law professor, widely seen as a likely 2024 presidential contender \u2014 says his goal is to hold tech companies accountable. \u201cThese companies, Google and Facebook in particular \u2014 Twitter, too \u2014 have built a model based around exploitative and addictive practices,\u201d he told me recently. \u201cI think we need to be asking ourselves, \u2018What is it that these companies have really given this country? Have they increased our economic productivity? Have they given us new and better jobs at higher wages? Have they made us more literate? More hospitable?\u2019 I don\u2019t think so. I think the answer is \u2018no\u2019 to all those questions.\u201d\n\nHawley\u2019s mix of policy entre\u00adpre\u00adneur\u00adship, anti-tech zeal and Trump-style provocation doesn\u2019t, of course, always win friends on the left \u2014 and, in fact, it can sometimes prove off-putting to conservatives. Consider legislation he introduced in June that would crack down on alleged anti-conservative bias in online searches and social media. The Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act would force large tech companies \u2014 under penalty of losing their immunity from what their billions of users do on their platforms \u2014 to submit to federal audits to ensure they don\u2019t engage in politically biased moderation.\n\nThe bill attracted zero co-sponsors and was panned on both sides of the political spectrum. Liberals argued that there\u2019s no evidence of anti-conservative censorship on the big platforms; to the contrary, conservative outlets like Fox News do quite well in Facebook engagement, and YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithm has been great for right-wing channels. Many conservatives, meanwhile, balked at the notion of empowering the federal government to regulate speech online. \u201cJosh Hawley\u2019s Internet Censorship Bill Is an Unwise, Unconstitutional Mess,\u201d declared a headline in the National Review.\n\nYet Hawley remains defiant. And why shouldn\u2019t he? The bill curried favor with Trump, the only Republican endorsement that matters. Moreover, the politics of tech have changed dramatically \u2014 in Hawley\u2019s direction \u2014 during the Trump era. Silicon Valley was long politically untouchable, insulated on the left by its ties to the Democratic establishment and on the right by a stable pro-corporate, free-market consensus. Trump\u2019s election threw both dynamics into question. Democrats have realized that social media platforms very likely enabled Trump\u2019s victory, no matter the political leanings of Mark Zuckerberg or Sheryl Sandberg. And Republicans increasingly understand that the GOP base has little affection for long-standing party orthodoxy on economic issues; maybe corporations \u2014 especially those tech companies seen as progressive \u2014 aren\u2019t untouchable just because they\u2019re profitable.\n\nThe result of all this is a D.C. environment that has become far more hostile to Big Tech, with the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and House Judiciary Committee recently launching parallel investigations of the major players. \u201cThe tech companies and their allies need to be really careful in this world,\u201d says Zach Graves, head of policy at the Lincoln Network, a conservative tech-focused think tank. \u201cA lot of them are still operating on George Bush-era assumptions about what the rules are. I don\u2019t think those rules apply anymore, and Hawley is great proof of that.\u201d\n\nBut Hawley may not be content to stop with Big Tech. In July, he introduced a bill with Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) to lower the value of the dollar \u2014 a serious break from long-standing Republican consensus on trade. And in a speech he gave not long after the social media summit, he took shots at both parties for worsening the nation\u2019s economic divide: \u201cFor years, the politics of both left and right have been informed by a political consensus that reflects the interests not of the American middle, but of a powerful upper class and their cosmopolitan priorities,\u201d he declared, adding: \u201cAnd where has this left middle America? Well, with flat wages, with lost jobs, with declining investment and declining opportunity.\u201d\n\nYou can almost hear those words coming from the mouth of someone like Bernie Sanders \u2014 and they raise tantalizing questions about just how far the bipartisanship of Josh Hawley and those who share his views may, or may not, plausibly go. Is the overlap between the left and Hawley-ism like the middle of a Venn diagram? Or is it more like the momentary intersection of two lines pointing in very different directions, and diverging outward to infinity?\n\nHawley campaigning in St. Charles, Mo., in 2018. (Jeff Roberson/Associated Press)\n\nLike many political phenoms who seem to emerge out of nowhere onto the national stage, Hawley\u2019s preparations for a career in public office began early. Growing up in Lexington, Mo., a small town surrounded by farmland about an hour\u2019s drive east from Kansas City, Hawley showed a keen interest in what was happening in Washington. While still in high school, at a private Catholic prep school in Kansas City, he wrote an opinion column for his hometown newspaper called \u201cState of the Union.\u201d (Sample take: \u201cThe American people no longer want security provided by the government; they want freedom to provide their own security unhindered by government.\u201d)\n\nAs a freshman at Stanford, Hawley approached historian David M. Kennedy to do an independent study about the history of the presidency. Kennedy was reluctant. \u201cI gave him a list of pretty heavy readings going back to the 19th century, frankly expecting I\u2019d never see him again,\u201d he recalls. Hawley returned two weeks later and Kennedy, skeptical that he had actually absorbed the reading, quizzed Hawley on the contents. \u201cHe nailed every question absolutely perfectly. It was clear he had read it all carefully, critically, assimilated it, thought it through. It was a truly impressive response from a young student.\u201d\n\nLater, Kennedy supervised Hawley\u2019s senior thesis, an intellectual history of Theodore Roosevelt that would turn into a book. \u201cIt might have been one of the most impressive senior theses that I supervised over more than 40 years of teaching at Stanford,\u201d Kennedy says. At the same time, Hawley was very much a politician in the making: \u201cIt was clear he had that kind of ambition. He had the whole package from a very early age.\u201d\n\nAfter Stanford came Yale Law School, where Hawley led the school\u2019s chapter of the Federalist Society, an influential conservative legal network. Ian Bassin, who was Hawley\u2019s liberal counterpart as president of Yale\u2019s American Constitution Society, remembers Hawley as a \u201creligious and moral person\u201d who had compassion for people with different views. \u201cThose of us who really appreciated talking to people we didn\u2019t agree with, we found Josh to be genuinely principled and interesting,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt was a good back and forth that we had.\u201d\n\nHawley sometimes seems like a walking manifestation of horseshoe theory \u2014 the idea that the political spectrum is not a line, but a curve along which the far left and the far right eventually bend toward each other.\n\nAt Yale, Hawley made an important early political connection. Harold Hongju Koh, then the Law School dean and a fixture of the Democratic foreign policy establishment, had invited former senator John Danforth, a pillar of the Missouri Republican Party, to give a talk. Afterward, at a dinner party, Koh made a point of sitting Danforth next to one of his students, a young conservative from Missouri. \u201cHe is just such a good person that I want you to know him,\u201d Danforth recalls Koh saying. Koh remembers the setup slightly differently. Hawley \u201cwas eager, desperate to meet Danforth, and I like to help my students achieve what they want, so I introduced them to each other,\u201d he says. Either way, it was the start of a friendship \u2014 one that would come in handy when Hawley was ready to enter Missouri politics.\n\nFollowing law school, Hawley spent a year clerking for Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., and he began dating a co-clerk, Erin Morrow, who would become his wife. After a stint at D.C. law firms, they joined the University of Missouri Law School faculty, while Hawley also worked for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a public interest law firm.\n\nHis writings from those years provide a window into his politics. In a 2010 essay for National Affairs titled \u201cAmerica\u2019s Epicurean Liberalism,\u201d he wrote that the \u201ccelebration of individual will\u201d is \u201cclosely associated with a series of prominent dysfunctions in contemporary America.\u201d By Hawley\u2019s account, the growth of a liberal state devoted to individualism had paradoxically reduced liberty by replacing the functions of civil society with government \u2014 \u201ctoo often leaving no room for the mediating institutions of family, churches, civic associations, and fraternal groups that keep society strong and free.\u201d\n\nHawley stresses that he doesn\u2019t think the government has any business directly promoting Christianity. But his views on religion certainly place him toward the far right of the spectrum. This spring, he shocked even Republican colleagues by torpedoing a federal judicial nominee who, as a lawyer representing East Lansing, Mich., had defended the application of that city\u2019s anti-discrimination law against a Catholic-owned orchard that announced it wouldn\u2019t allow same-sex marriages on its property. And in Missouri in 2018, he drew criticism for suggesting that the 20th-century sexual revolution was responsible for sex trafficking \u201con a scale that we would never have imagined.\u201d\n\nHawley, left, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Andrew Harnik/Associated Press)\n\nIn his book, \u201cTheodore Roosevelt: Preacher of Righteousness,\u201d which he published when he was just 28, Hawley describes a scenario that may sound familiar. For the election of 1884, the Republican Party nominated James G. Blaine, a controversial presidential candidate with a history of sketchy real estate dealings and an economic platform centered on protective tariffs. A number of high-minded GOP members broke ranks and refused to support him. But Roosevelt, an up-and-coming Republican politician, decided to set aside his contempt and back the nominee in the name of party loyalty. \u201cPolitics,\u201d he told himself, in Hawley\u2019s summary, \u201cwas a rough business; the political man must, to do any good, be willing to work with the less-than-ideal.\u201d\n\nHawley has taken many of his cues from the iconoclastic former president, his boyhood hero. Like Roosevelt, who grew up wealthy in New York City but remade himself as a rugged outdoorsman, Hawley has cultivated an image as a political outsider. In 2016, when he ran for Missouri attorney general, his campaign produced an ad featuring him walking toward the camera as, all around, men in suits climb literal ladders. Hawley is tall, lean and muscular, with a thick swoop of brushed-back brown hair and a narrow, serious face. Speaking in the sonorous baritone of a radio announcer, he says: \u201cJefferson City is full of career politicians just climbing the ladder. I think you deserve better.\u201d A narrator\u2019s voice concludes: \u201cJosh Hawley. Conservative. Outsider. Attorney general.\u201d\n\nThe 2016 race was Hawley\u2019s first foray into politics. That November, he cruised to victory, winning slightly more votes statewide than even Trump. From the beginning, he did not behave like someone content to stay on the bottom rung. An investigation by the Kansas City Star found that, as attorney general, Hawley\u2019s payroll included a team of D.C.-based political consultants, who helped choreograph high-profile initiatives including litigation against opioid manufacturers and a raid on alleged sex traffickers, where Hawley appeared, camera-ready, wearing a law-enforcement badge around his neck. (The consultants were paid not by the attorney general\u2019s office but by Hawley\u2019s campaign committee, which is allowed under state law.) What drew Hawley\u2019s first national headlines, however, was the announcement of an antitrust investigation against Google \u2014 a sign both of his early interest in the subject and of its political potential.\n\nThe ladder-climbing ad became infamous in Missouri politics when, less than a year into his term, Hawley announced he was running to try to unseat Sen. Claire McCaskill (D). Hawley, who was heavily recruited to join the race, insists that the Senate wasn\u2019t on his mind when he ran for attorney general.\n\nTo a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren, the problem with woke capital is the capital. To a Josh Hawley, it\u2019s the wokeness.\n\nIt was during his Senate race that Hawley\u2019s current public persona started coming into view. In his campaign announcement video, flanked in the family kitchen by his wife and two young sons, he began laying down the anti-elite refrain he has been humming ever since. \u201cThe D.C. career crowd just keeps on doing the same old thing,\u201d he told the camera. \u201cAnd you know? The system works pretty well for them. They\u2019re connected.\u201d\n\nHis challenge, as Missouri political reporters Lindsay Wise and Bryan Lowry would later write, \u201cwas to convince both the populist, Trumpian wing of the Republican Party and the country club establishment that he was secretly one of them \u2014 and that he was just humoring the other guys.\u201d Early on, it looked like that might prove difficult. In August 2017, Hawley skipped a Trump rally in Springfield; the week before, his political mentor, Danforth, had published a blistering op-ed in The Washington Post urging Republicans to break with the president. After Hawley refused to denounce Danforth, a pro-Trump Republican threatened to jump into the race. According to news reports at the time, Hawley\u2019s campaign grew worried that former Trump adviser Steve Bannon would follow through on threats to back a primary opponent, and Hawley called Bannon to assure him they were on the same team. The next time Trump came to Missouri, Hawley was there to greet him. After that, Trump became a frequent visitor to the state, appearing with Hawley at a rally the night before the election. The next day, Hawley defeated McCaskill 51 percent to 45 percent.\n\nHawley\u2019s embrace of Trump and other politically expedient positions \u2014 he ran ads declaring his support for coverage of preexisting conditions even as he joined litigation to overturn the Affordable Care Act \u2014 strained some relationships. \u201cI was deeply disappointed in his behavior,\u201d Koh told me. \u201cIt shocked me he was so eager to win he was ready to say pretty much anything.\u201d\n\nDanforth, who in an interview described himself as a friend and admirer of Hawley, didn\u2019t criticize him directly \u2014 but he made clear that he dislikes anti-elite populist rhetoric. \u201cThat\u2019s just a standard political style today, to try to convince people that they\u2019re being victimized by the in group, the powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nSome of Hawley\u2019s Yale classmates, including former friendly rival Bassin, also wrote an open letter to Missouri voters blasting him. \u201cWe may not have always agreed with Josh\u2019s politics during law school, but those of us who knew him respected his principles,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe have been saddened to see Josh abandon those principles as he tries to climb the political ladder.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump at a campaign rally for Hawley in Springfield, Mo., in 2018. (Charlie Riedel/Associated Press)\n\nEvery politician faces questions about authenticity; the unusual thing about Hawley is that the private version of him appears to be more likable than the political one. When I asked his wife, Erin, to tell me something that most people don\u2019t know about him, she said: \u201cI would probably say the fun side. He has a wicked sense of humor and so we laugh a lot. \u2026 I\u2019m not sure you get that from the public persona.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the public Hawley is dependably grim. In Senate hearings, he\u2019s sarcastic and stern. During one hearing a week after the White House social media summit, he verbally cornered Karan Bhatia, vice president of public policy at Google, letting Bhatia repeat his assurances that Google would never censor or filter results based on political viewpoints, before pouncing on the fact that the company deployed a censored search engine in China for four years before shutting it down in 2010. \u201cYou have been more than happy to partner with the most repressive authoritarian regime on the planet,\u201d Hawley said from the dais. \u201cAll for profits. Whatever it is that\u2019s good for Google. Why would anybody believe you now?\u201d\n\nIn other settings, Hawley can be downright apocalyptic. A few hours after the Google hearing, he was at a hotel in Washington delivering a keynote speech to the first National Conservatism Conference, a three-day gathering of the nascent movement to impose intellectual architecture on the post-Trump conservative coalition. \u201cThe fate of our republican government is at issue,\u201d he warned, raising the specter of a \u201ccosmopolitan elite\u201d with questionable allegiances. \u201cThis class lives in the United States, but they identify as \u2018citizens of the world.\u2019 They run businesses or oversee universities here, but their primary loyalty is to the global community.\u201d\n\nThe speech drew warm applause in person, but Hawley\u2019s rhetoric didn\u2019t go over so well online. A number of Jewish and left-leaning critics, including New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, called out Hawley\u2019s notion of a \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d elite as anti-Semitic. (\u201cRootless cosmopolitan\u201d was a common anti-Semitic slur in the Soviet Union, and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories often depict Jews as globalists who are disloyal to the nations they live in. \u201cIf you\u2019re Jewish and the use of \u2018cosmopolitan\u2019 doesn\u2019t scare you, read some history,\u201d Krugman tweeted.)\n\nHawley, as always, was unapologetic. \u201cWhen it comes to liberals,\u201d he told Tucker Carlson the following week on Fox News, \u201cthere\u2019s only one thing that they love more than being elites, and that\u2019s accusing everyone else of being bigots.\u201d\n\nWhen I met Hawley in his Senate office the next day, however, there was little trace of that hostility. In person, he was a totally game interview subject, playful, quick to laugh, including at himself, and to smile broadly. Even his theory of politics was subtly different. In speeches and Fox News appearances, he portrays elites as scheming and disloyal; at the conference, he argued that \u201cthe leadership class have tried to build a new state in their own image.\u201d But when we spoke, he seemed more understanding. \u201cI think both parties were probably caught off guard by this, frankly, by these developments over the last 20 or 30 years, because the neoliberal consensus, if you like, predicted something different,\u201d he said, leaning back, one arm draped over his office\u2019s leather couch. \u201cAnd now we\u2019ve got to think through what do we do about that.\u201d\n\nI asked him what he meant by \u201ccosmopolitan elite\u201d \u2014 and how someone with his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 doesn\u2019t qualify. \u201cThe problem is not people going to places like Stanford or Yale, or wherever they go,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is thinking that just because that\u2019s something that they wanted to do with their lives, that their priorities and their ambitions and their values should control the whole rest of the country\u2019s.\u201d\n\nHawley insists that his evocation of \u201cthe great American middle\u201d is not code for whites or Christians. \u201cIn this country, we are proudly and rightly \u2014 we\u2019re not united by blood, we\u2019re not united by ethnicity, we\u2019re not united by race,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are united by the things we love together. And in loving those things together, we come to love each other. That has got to be our goal, and that has got to be our aspiration.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s poetry. Who could object to coming together in love? (At that point, I scribbled in my notebook: \u201cMarianne Williamson?\u201d) But an unpleasant corollary is that there\u2019s another group of Americans who don\u2019t love the same things. According to Hawley, that\u2019s an elite made up of Wall Street, Hollywood, academia, the news media \u2014 and, of course, Big Tech.\n\nHawley at a campaign rally before Trump takes the stage in Springfield, Mo., in 2018. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nDefining politics in opposition to some enemy of the masses is the very definition of populism, and the role that the cosmopolitan elite play in Hawley\u2019s rhetoric is similar to the one that \u201cmillionaires and billionaires\u201d play in Bernie Sanders\u2019s. In fact, Hawley sometimes seems like a walking manifestation of horseshoe theory \u2014 the idea that the political spectrum is not a line, but a curve along which the far left and the far right eventually bend toward each other. \u201cThese orthodoxies, plural, that have defined our politics, really since the Second World War, it is time for them to be put to rest,\u201d he told me.\n\nAnd yet, with the major exceptions of trade policy and his willingness to aggressively regulate Big Tech, it\u2019s hard to find examples of Republican orthodoxy that Hawley actually rejects. He supported the 2017 tax cut, which heavily benefited corporations and the wealthy, and told me he still thinks it was a good idea. In Missouri, he backed a right-to-work law that voters overwhelmingly rejected in a statewide referendum. And while Hawley expresses general concern about the threat of rising corporate concentration, especially to small businesses, he hasn\u2019t co-sponsored any of the bills Senate Democrats have introduced to strengthen antitrust enforcement. (In a statement, Hawley\u2019s spokesperson pointed out that Hawley asked about antitrust and tech during Attorney General William Barr\u2019s confirmation hearing. \u201cAs he has said consistently,\u201d the spokesperson noted, \u201cantitrust enforcement is a critical tool in the competition policy tool kit, and he is friendly to all efforts to begin a conversation about how best to use and strengthen those tools.\u201d) I was surprised to have to prod him to discuss Amazon, a corporation that in some ways dominates the economy more than any of the other tech giants and may be doing the most to crush independent merchants. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nSince his speech at the National Conservatism Conference, a fair bit of liberal commentary has pointed to Hawley\u2019s political positions and wondered whether he\u2019s a \u201creal\u201d populist. That may be the wrong question. Populism isn\u2019t an ideology; it\u2019s a style, not wedded to any particular policy agenda. J.D. Vance, the conservative author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d and a friend of Hawley\u2019s, told me he thinks Hawley is betting that the Republican Party can be the first to win over an American working class that is to the left of the GOP economically, but to the right of the Democrats on social issues. The challenge \u2014 especially as long as Trump leads the party \u2014 is figuring out how to appeal to working-class whites, whose cultural conservatism heavily centers on immigration and race, without alienating minority working-class voters.\n\nHawley attempts this by blaming the declining economic fortunes of the working class not primarily on illegal immigration, but on the various manifestations of cultural liberalism. Philosophers and screenwriters are, in this telling, somehow responsible for offshoring jobs to China. \u201cI think the big divide of our time is between the leadership class and their aspirations and their value set and their ideals, and the aspirations and ideals and therefore the lives of the folks in the middle of our country,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd our economic structure reflects that.\u201d\n\nThis theory helps explain why social media is such a natural target for Hawley. If any place in America combines liberal cultural values with a hardcore capitalist streak, it\u2019s Silicon Valley. Conservatives even have a name for this: \u201cwoke capital\u201d \u2014 the idea that corporations engage in performative cultural progressivism to stave off criticism of their business practices.\n\nHawley\u2019s anti-censorship bill is \u201cone of the best examples that we have of what a nationalist would mean when they say they want to use political power to address a cultural problem,\u201d says David French, author of the National Review piece criticizing the legislation. \u201cThe one area in which the right broadly has been much more successful is politics, and the left has been broadly successful in culture, and therefore [they think] what we must do to save our nation is exert political power to change the national culture.\u201d\n\nThis is where the left and right critiques of corporate America part ways. To a Bernie Sanders or an Elizabeth Warren, the problem with woke capital is the capital. To a Josh Hawley, it\u2019s the wokeness.\n\nTo the left, the sweeping social changes over the past 40 years happened despite a growing economic divide. But to Hawley, the former caused the latter. The rise of an individualist culture that devalues traditional Christian morality, hard work and civil society is responsible, along with the endurance of the post-New Deal welfare state, for the hollowing out of the middle class. If you believe that, then of course your political program is going to look nothing like that of a liberal who wants to raise the minimum wage and expand the social safety net. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t give people dignity,\u201d Hawley told me. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t give them the ability to manage and control their own lives.\u201d\n\nThis is why, despite the surface-level overlap between left- and right-wing economic populism, they remain so irreconcilably opposed. Both sides might hate Big Tech; both sides might justify their policy objectives in terms of reviving the economic fortunes of middle America. But because their theories of what has gone wrong are almost entirely different, they will continue to pull in opposite policy directions. And they will continue to train their anger on (mostly) different enemies.\n\nAfter about an hour, Hawley\u2019s staff finally persuaded him to wrap up the interview so he could make his next appointment. As we stood up, I squeezed in one more question: Did he really believe the media was ignoring censorship of conservatives, as he had said with his \u201cfake media\u201d comment at the social media summit? \u201cMy sense is the mainstream media thinks that is just ridiculous, that it\u2019s a joke,\u201d he said.
