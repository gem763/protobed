We've seen the public's right to know slowly erode over the past two decades, with the introduction of laws that make it more difficult for people to speak up when they see wrongdoing and for journalists to report these stories,\" David Anderson, managing director of Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), said in a release issued to Business Insider.\n\n\"No one is above the law but something in our democracy is not working as it should when we fail to protect people acting in the public interest.\"\n\nRead more: China just blocked The Washington Post and The Guardian from the country's internet\n\nThe campaign cites 60 different pieces of legislation that have been introduced over the last two decades in the country \u2014 laws it claims seek to \"criminalize journalism and penalize whistleblowing.\"\n\nIt comes after a string of concerted and highly controversial attacks on the Australian media this year. In June, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) raided the ABC's Sydney offices as well as the Canberra home of a News Corp journalist. According to the news agencies, the raids had been organized over articles that relied on leaked documents from whistleblowers. Both media organizations are waiting to hear the outcome of each investigation and whether their journalists will face prosecution.\n\n\u2014Richard D Boyle (@Richard_D_Boyle) October 20, 2019\n\nIn response to Monday's campaign, AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw told a Senate inquiry that the AFP had launched an internal inquiry into its media investigations.\n\nRead more: Trump accuses Twitter and Facebook of censoring him and conservative commentators during bizarre 'social-media summit'\n\n\"The review will not be an audit into current matters at hand but rather a holistic approach to ensure we have in place investigative policy and guidelines that are fit for purpose,\" Kershaw said.\n\nHe was less sure in his answering of whether or not more media raids were planned.\n\n\"This is not just about police raids of journalists' homes and our nation's newsrooms,\" Nine Entertainment's CEO Hugh Marks said. \"This is much bigger than the media. It's about defending the basic right of every Australian to be properly informed about the important decisions the government is making in their name.\"\n\nWhistleblowers in particular appear to have been in the government's firing line. Take the case of Richard Boyle, an employee with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), who went to the media after his organization planned to take money from people's bank accounts without their knowledge. In doing so, he threw his entire career away and now faces being sentenced to up to 161 years imprisonment if found guilty.\n\nThe media is now calling for legislative changes to protect whistleblowers like Boyle as well as the journalists who endeavor to tell their stories. The proposed reforms would prevent journalists from being jailed and force the government to consider the public interest before conducting raids and prosecutions.\n\nWithout these, Australia's media is warning that the news may as well just be censored like the newspapers front pages that were published on Monday.", "description": "The protest comes after the Australian Federal Police (AFP) raided the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the home of a journalist.", "authors": ["Sophia Ankel", "Business Insider Australia"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5dada137695b587e991343fe?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
