Other times, you just want to go somewhere \u201cwarm\u201d or \u201ccheap\u201d and are open to options. For those times, Escape is a site that can help you with a little inspiration.\n\nWith it, you enter where you\u2019re travelling from as well as when you\u2019d like to travel. Afterward, the site will give you pricing for different destinations around the world you can travel to during your specified travel dates along with pricing information on how much it will cost for you to get there.\n\nBeyond just pricing, you can also filter results by what kind of visa you\u2019ll need to travel to a destination, how popular or safe it is, what there is to do there, and was the weather is likely to be like during your trip.\n\nFor instance, a trip from Sydney to anywhere over the Christmas and New Year's break showed me that Sydney to Asia would cost from $1126 and Europe from $1291.\n\nImage: Escape\n\nResults are presented on a map that\u2019s initially zoomed out to give you an overview of your options but can be zoomed in on when you want to get more specific. For instance, that $1126 trip to Asia, upon closer inspection, is a flight to Dili, Timor-Leste, specifically. I can also get to Singapore that weekend for $1137 or Sorong, Indonesia for $1219.\n\nIf you\u2019re more interested in what the weather will be like where you\u2019re travelling than the cost, you can set a particular temperature range you\u2019re comfortable with on the site, for instance, 21-32 degrees Celcius. You can also say whether or not you\u2019ll be likely or unlikely to see snow on that trip.\n\nFor vacations where you already know where you\u2019re going, this site obviously isn\u2019t going to be very useful. If you\u2019re still in the early planning stages of your next vacation and are still trying to determine the \u201cwhere\u201d of where you\u2019re travelling; however, then it can be a great place to start.", "description": "Sometimes a vacation is to a destination you specifically want to visit.
