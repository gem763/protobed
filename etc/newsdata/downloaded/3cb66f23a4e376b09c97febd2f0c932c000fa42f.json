She noted that Benedict College did not personally extend the invitation to Trump to attend the forum, which was organized by the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center. That organization, of which Artis is a part, is comprised of a bipartisan group of Black leaders across the country.\n\n\u201cI think people\u2019s emotional reactions to Donald Trump and the misunderstanding of how this came to be \u2015 the idea that we extended a personal invitation to Donald Trump to come to an HBCU campus \u2015 have caused people to be a little irrational,\u201d Artis said.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump\u2019s award comes just days after he faced backlash for calling the House impeachment investigation a \u201clynching.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!\u201d the president tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nThe term is associated with a form of white terrorism used in the Jim Crow era that was responsible for the death of thousands of Black Americans, according to the NAACP.\n\nMany Democratic 2020 candidates, including Harris, spoke out against the president\u2019s use of the word to describe the congressional investigation.\n\n\u201cLynching is a reprehensible stain on this nation\u2019s history, as is this President,\u201d Harris tweeted. \u201cWe\u2019ll never erase the pain and trauma of lynching, and to invoke that torture to whitewash your own corruption is disgraceful.\u201d\n\nThe senator said Friday she would meet with students and community members on Saturday to discuss criminal justice reform instead of attending the forum at Benedict College.", "description": "The president received the award for his efforts to pass the First Step Act on federal prison reform.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db38d9c210000cf2c34b172.jpeg?cache=tuecytt2mf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
