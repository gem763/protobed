The main thing it boils down to is the fact that with a safety razor, you\u2019re shaving with only one blade \u2014 many of our experts told us that more blades do not necessarily mean a better shave, and that using multi-blade cartridges can increase the likelihood of ingrown hairs and razor burn. \u201cThe safety razor is the absolute way to go,\u201d says Chad Beightol, owner of New York City\u2013based men\u2019s-grooming store Consigliere. \u201cYou\u2019re working with a single blade that is sharp, instead of relying on a multi-blade cartridge that is trying to trap the hair between the blades.\u201d Paul Langevin of barbershop Mildred New York adds, \u201cThe single blade minimizes irritation.\u201d Another plus is that safety razor blades are far less expensive to replace than disposable cartridges, and they don\u2019t generate any plastic waste.\n\nThe experts admitted that, at first, using a safety razor won\u2019t be quite as effortless as shaving with a Gilette or Shick (and if you\u2019d rather stick to those cartridge razors, there are some on this list, too). But they say most people are quick converts once they get the hang of it. We\u2019ve written about safety razors before, and German razor manufacturer Merkur was the brand that came most recommended. The Merkur 34C was our experts\u2019 top pick, with many saying it\u2019s an especially good choice for beginners because the short handle makes it easy to maneuver.", "description": "Grooming experts recommend the best razors, including cartridge, electric, and safety razors, from brands like Merkur, Bevel, Harry\u2019s, Gillette, Philips Norelco, Andis, Schick, and more.", "authors": ["David Notis"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/09/20/20-homer-simpson-shaving.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
