The once mighty caliphate has all but crumbled, and thousands of his fighters have been killed or languish in jail cells.\n\nSince the caliphate\u2019s collapse earlier this year, western intelligence agencies had speculated that Baghdadi had gone into hiding somewhere in the desert regions of Iraq or Syria. Despite being the most wanted terrorist in the world, he still managed to release occasional audio and video messages to Isis supporters.\n\nSpeaking from the White House, Mr Trump said Baghdadi met his end when the tunnel he had retreated into caved in due to the explosion caused by his suicide vest. He killed three of his own children with him.\n\nThe president added that Baghdadi\u2019s \u201cmutilated\u201d body was retrieved and tested, providing \u201ccertain, immediate and totally positive\u201d identification that it was the terrorist the US has hunted for so long.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In 2017, Russia said it was investigating whether one of its airstrikes on the city of Raqqa killed him and 300 other fighters. Other reports suggested he had been incapacitated by a US-led coalition strike.\n\nNews of the raid first emerged around midnight on Saturday when locals in northern Syria reported hearing gunfire and helicopters near the town of Barisha, just five miles from the Turkish border.\n\nWhile rumours swirled that Baghdadi had been killed, the details of the operation were withheld so they could be announced by Mr Trump.\n\nMr Trump said the US began to receive intelligence on the whereabouts of Baghdadi around a month ago. Intelligence officials were able to put the location under surveillance two weeks ago, allowing the president to authorise the raid three days ago.\n\nUS military personnel took off in eight helicopters from an unidentified military base in the Middle East.\n\nAs they approached the compound where Baghdadi was thought to be hiding, the helicopters came under gunfire but were able to land safely.\n\nThey quickly cleared the compound, \u201cwith people either surrendering or being shot and killed\u201d, said Mr Trump. Eleven children were removed, uninjured, and taken into care by a third party whom the president declined to name. US soldiers captured and later imprisoned several Islamic State fighters.\n\nBaghdadi fled into a tunnel complex, dragging three of his young children with him and pursued by US soldiers. When they demanded he surrender, he refused, and detonated his belt.\n\nBoris Johnson said: \u201cThe death of Baghdadi is an important moment in our fight against terror but the battle against the evil of Daesh is not yet over. We will work with our coalition partners to bring an end to the murderous, barbaric activities of Daesh once and for all.\u201d\n\nIn the hours after the raid, there were conflicting reports about who and what information paved the way for the operation.\n\nIraq\u2019s intelligence service said it had provided the US-led anti-Isis coalition with the exact coordinates of Baghdadi\u2019s location, paving the way for the raid that reportedly killed him.\n\nThe agency learned of Baghdadi\u2019s location from documents found at a secret location in Iraq\u2019s western desert after arresting an Iraqi man and woman from within his \u201cinner circle\u201d, an Iraqi intelligence official told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe have been constantly coordinating with the CIA, providing valuable information that the Iraqi National Intelligence Service has on Baghdadi\u2019s movements and place of hiding,\u201d the official said.\n\nMr Trump thanked a number of countries for their assistance in the raid, including Turkey, Russia, Syria and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which he said provided intelligence. The UK military was not believed to be involved in the operation.\n\nBaghdadi\u2019s alleged death comes at a time when many feared Isis was on the verge of a resurgence. A military operation by Turkey against Kurdish forces in the northeast has caused mass displacement and chaos, and led to a reduction in anti-Isis operations.\n\nThe group will now undergo a hunt to replace one of the world\u2019s most deadly jihadi leaders.\n\nBaghdadi was not just the Islamic State\u2019s military chief, but a self-proclaimed spiritual and religious leader. He was key to the group\u2019s brutality and its propaganda appeal, which brought followers from all around the world.\n\nBorn in the Iraqi city of Samarra in 1971 and radicalised by the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, he claimed to have descended from the Prophet Muhammad. His background in religious instruction gave him legitimacy in the eyes of his jihadi followers.\n\nTo the world, however, Baghdadi was a monster, responsible for untold death and suffering. Under his command, Isis committed genocide against the Yazidi people and took thousands of women as slaves. It murdered hostages and massacred civilians \u2013 most of them Muslims in Iraq and Syria.", "description": "For years, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u00a0ruled a brutal international terror organisation that killed thousands of innocents and held a territory greater than the size of Britain.\u00a0 In the end, he died like many of his victims: cornered and afraid.", "authors": ["Richard Hall", "Dave Maclean"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/05/01/02/Baghdadi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
