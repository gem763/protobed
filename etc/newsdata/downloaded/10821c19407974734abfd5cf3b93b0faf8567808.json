Video Shows Indian Square In New Jersey Littered After Diwali & It's Shameful", "language": "en", "text": "Diwali is a festival which is celebrated by people all across the country, and even by Indians who leave overseas, far away from their motherland. It is called the festival of lights, but people have made it a \u2018festival of firecrackers\u2019! The aftermath of the festival is hazardous and despite so many campaigns to dissuade people from bursting crackers, there was very less, if any restraint shown on that front.\n\nA video that is going viral on social media shows empty boxes, wrappers of firecrackers and other materials littered on the roads. No, not on Indian roads, but on New Jersey roads! A large crowd gathered at the India Square - where all the Indians celebrated Diwali.\n\nYou can see some people speaking in Hindi in the video and seconds later, a New Jersey police van is seen patrolling on the streets. The video was shared on Twitter with the caption, \u2018Ashamed to be called an Indian. Last Night on Indian Street near Journal Square New Jersey. Hats off to NJ Police handling the mess Very professionally\u2019.\n\nWatch the video here:\n\nAshamed to be called an Indian\n\nLast Night on Indian Street near Journal Square New Jersey\n\nHats off to NJ Police handling the mess Very professionally \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f pic.twitter.com/39nVmGaejO \u2014 sANDhya (@DhooDala) October 28, 2019\n\nThe video garnered over 35.5 k views, 536 likes and comments.\n\n1.\n\nSo called the best Culture in the world, my @$ \u2014 Rakesh Mhatre (@Rakesh6497) October 29, 2019\n\nDon't Miss\n\n2.\n\nIndians are champion litterers. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 \u2014 Rod O'Net (@rodonet) October 29, 2019\n\n3.\n\nThis place felt like a was zone with all the noise and smoke before the administration has to stop it. pic.twitter.com/LLWhwXkTBC \u2014 Harjinder Singh (@pisingh_) October 28, 2019\n\n4.\n\nWish that the NJ police clear we Indians off the streets and the country instead of the mess \u2014 Vijayan Rao (@VijayanRao1) October 28, 2019\n\n5.\n\nall indians should undergo compulsory rigorous training camps on cleanliness before entering these developed countries \u2014 Kishor Siri (@KishyCool) October 29, 2019\n\n6.\n\nYes.. Totally agree.. I saw it in UK also. One of our person throwing food waste from 3rd floor window. We never bother about the cleanliness. \u2014 Bala Iyer (@Bala1000) October 28, 2019\n\n7.\n\nUnless Diwali is celebrated, there is a lurking insecurity!\n\nLittering is inevitable at the present-level we understand as \"celebration\"( masters celebrate a disciple getting enlightened, quietly when whole nature around lights up illogically \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23) \u2014 Narayanan P S (@narayananpsn) October 28, 2019\n\nSpitting and littering is all too common a sight in India, and a fine on people doing the same has been long awaited so that people think twice before littering. It is shameful that mature adults - in our country and abroad - still struggle with the concept of cleanliness. It is indeed disturbing, that the remnants of a glorious festival like Diwali, were litter and shame.", "description": "Diwali is a festival which is celebrated by people all around the world with joy and happiness.
