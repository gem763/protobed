From youthful rap to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air to Independence Day to global domination, Smith was on you so fast you barely had time to register that he\u2019d taken over the world. And in recent years, he has remained likable and relatable, even when his star has taken a dip or two. He even managed to still be charming in Suicide Squad, which one would have thought impossible.\n\nAnd don\u2019t think he doesn\u2019t have depth, either, playing \u201cserious\u201d roles in both dramas (Ali) and four-quadrant blockbusters (I Am Legend). Even with his missteps, Smith remains the sort of movie star you just don\u2019t see anymore. With the release of Gemini Man, we went back and ranked all of his movie performances.\n\n(Quick note: We decided to exclude his voice work in animated films. And sorry, Bright didn\u2019t get a theatrical release, so it\u2019s not on here. It\u2019s best for Smith if we ignore it anyway.)\n\n29. After Earth (2013)\n\nThe debacle that prompted Smith to take an 18-month hiatus from acting, After Earth really is as bad as you remember: an overly ponderous, drag-ass sci-fi action-drama in which Will\u2019s son Jaden wholly lacks the charisma that made his dad a mega-star. What undoubtedly made its failure harder on Smith was that he had dreamed up the original story and thrust his son into the central role, figuring it would propel him up the Hollywood food chain. Maybe that\u2019s why Smith looks so glum throughout the film: He seems to be realizing in real time what a bad idea After Earth was.\n\n28. Collateral Beauty (2016)\n\nYeah, it\u2019s the complete misguided mess that you\u2019ve heard it is, but all told, it\u2019s more embarrassing for Edward Norton, Michael Pena, and Kate Winslet \u2014 who play the awful human beings meant to be the \u201cgood guys\u201d of this bewildering \u201cheartwarmer\u201d \u2014 than it is for Smith, who is mostly put-upon and thus escapes the true awfulness. The real problem with Smith here is one that\u2019s common to many of his \u201cserious\u201d performances: He turns down the star wattage that we love about Will Smith and turns mopey and morose. There are already enough mopey and morose actors: There\u2019s no need for you to be one, Will. Though to be fair: It\u2019s possible he realized the dog of a movie he was in and just couldn\u2019t work up any smiles anyway.\n\n27. Men in Black II (2002)\n\nEverything that was terrific about the first Men in Black \u2014 the witty premise, the hip tone, the oil-and-vinegar rapport between Smith and Tommy Lee Jones \u2014 evaporates in this strained, unfunny sequel. Where Smith\u2019s Agent J was once an awesome smartass, Men in Black II presents him as just a smug dick. This is the first time Smith seemed to take a movie precisely because he needed a hit \u2014 which, in the wake of Wild Wild West, was the case.\n\n26. Seven Pounds (2008)\n\nThe infamous Jellyfish movie. This is the closest Smith ever came to John Travolta\u2019s Battlefield Earth territory, a personal project that\u2019s a nightmare to sit through and seriously made you wonder for a second if Smith had some sort of Jesus complex. And seriously: Watch that jellyfish scene:\n\n25. Wild Wild West (1999)\n\nThis really did make sense at the time. Barry Sonnenfeld of the Men in Black films, Kevin Kline as the trusty sidekick, and a sci-fi-meets-Western premise. But, wow, did it ever go wrong. (Starting with that terrible theme song. We bet Smith would like that one back.) Pandering, chaotic, disorganized Hollywood filmmaking at its worst. The one true big-budget flop of Smith\u2019s career, and you can\u2019t say it doesn\u2019t earn the designation.\n\n24. Where the Day Takes You (1991)\n\nWhat\u2019s it like when a seemingly random smattering of early \u201890s up-and-coming young \u201cstars\u201d all don\u2019t take a bath for a day and pretend to be \u201ctroubled\u201d drug addicts on the streets of Los Angeles? Well, it looks like a movie-of-the-week with everybody wearing flannel. Seriously, check out this crazy cast: Dermot Mulroney, Sean Astin, Lara Flynn Boyle, Christian Slater, David Arquette, Nancy McKeon, Alyssa Milano, Ricki Lake! Smith, in his first film, plays Manny, a legless homeless kid who mostly shows up to be friendly, move a wheelchair quickly, and get beaten up. Fortunately, Smith would be out of these roles very soon.\n\n23. Winters\u2019s Tale (2014)\n\nSmith has just a small part in this Akiva Goldman misfire, but it\u2019s a super silly one: He plays the devil! He doesn\u2019t do a lot of devilish things, but he does do this:\n\n22. Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013)\n\nWe had kinda forgotten he was in this, too. Or, maybe we just wanted to forget: Smith is part of the epic, lame battle royale that happens near the end of this just-good-enough sequel. He\u2019s the anchor of the ESPN crew, and his cameo consists mostly of a goofy early-\u201980s hairdo. And what\u2019s with his voice? Is he trying to make his character sound prissy or nerdy or what? Don\u2019t feel too bad, Will: Everybody in this scene \u2014 Tina Fey, Kanye West, Jim Carrey \u2014 comes off badly.\n\n21. The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)\n\nA classic \u201cMagical Negro\u201d role that Smith was able to avoid the rest of his career, this is a low point for both Smith and director Robert Redford. The role is beneath Will Smith, and really beneath any prominent black actor; it\u2019s impossible to imagine it being made today. Seriously, watch this again: You\u2019ll be pretty taken aback. (It was also the last film of Jack Lemmon.)\n\n20. Suicide Squad (2016)\n\nWell, you certainly can\u2019t blame Smith for everything that goes wrong with Suicide Squad, and at the very least, he\u2019s a reason to keep watching when the movie is flapping all over the place and running into walls. He and Robbie are the only people who seem to have put much thought into what went onscreen, and for that, we must express our gratefulness. And then run out of the theater.\n\n19. Bad Boys II (2003)\n\nSmith didn\u2019t have to do this sequel \u2014 he was already the biggest movie star on the planet at this point \u2014 and he probably should have stayed away. This is Michael Bay trying maybe a little too much comedy, to the point that the opening sequence takes place at a Klan rally in which Martin Lawrence gets shot in the butt. It goes downhill from there, but Smith somehow keeps it afloat, largely because he\u2019s Will Smith and has an internal governor that won\u2019t let him sink too low. (One suspects he cringes when he watches this now.) There are rumors that a Bad Boys III is coming. Let those stay rumors.\n\n18. Jersey Girl (2004)\n\nYes, Will Smith was in a Kevin Smith movie. Only briefly, though. This brief, and ill-fated, attempt by Kevin Smith to become a Serious Hollywood Filmmaker fell on its face \u2014 to be fair, it would have difficult for anything to survive Bennifer \u2014 but it\u2019s worth pointing out that Smith has a wonderful little cameo here. Playing himself, he comes across Ben Affleck\u2019s character in a hospital waiting room and provides the film its only genuine moment, in which he and Affleck share a moment of understanding and commiseration that feels earned. It\u2019s also funny how Smith plays himself. Unlike most movie stars, who feel the need to send up their persona, Smith is just how he sees himself, and maybe how he actually is: A laid-back guy who\u2019s living the best life and can\u2019t believe how lucky he is. Few movie stars have felt so comfortable in their own skin. You see that surprisingly well here.\n\n17. Aladdin (2019)\n\nAfter the initial Aladdin trailer, which revealed Will Smith as the Big Blue Dude, received less-than-stellar responses from the internet, it was reasonable to go into this live-action remake with major worries. Lowered expectations are probably for the best: The new movie isn\u2019t terrible, although it\u2019s certainly a far cry from the original. Ditto Smith as the jovial genie. Weirdly, for all the hits he\u2019s been a part of over the decades, he\u2019s rarely done what you\u2019d call a straight-up family film, outside of maybe Shark Tale, so it\u2019s interesting to see him tap into his big-kid gusto in such a pronounced way. Still, anyone attempting to outdo Robin Williams is asking for trouble, so it\u2019s just as well that Smith doesn\u2019t try, mostly playing the character as the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air all grown up. Too much of this Aladdin seems designed chiefly to make money, and likewise Smith\u2019s performance is profoundly efficient \u2014 it\u2019s a somewhat impressive technical and creative feat that no one really needed.\n\n16. Focus (2015)\n\nSmith is extremely fun as a con man \u2014 the first con man he\u2019d played since Six Degrees of Separation 20 years earlier, a movie that strikes a very different pitch \u2014 in a movie that never quite figures out whether it\u2019s a heist comedy, a dark thriller, or something. He has obvious rapport with Margot Robbie, which would carry over to a worse movie in Suicide Squad, and, as usual, he effortlessly gets the audience on his side. The story has too many twists and turns to be taken seriously, but it\u2019s worth it just to hang out.\n\n15. Concussion (2015)\n\nSmith\u2019s best straight-drama performance since 2006\u2019s The Pursuit of Happyness finds him playing Bennet Omalu, a soft-spoken Nigerian doctor living in Pittsburgh who helped uncover the traumatic brain injuries devastating NFL players. It\u2019s a modest portrayal without much in the way of actorly fireworks, and the two-time Oscar nominee leans heavily on his quiet decency. When you\u2019re among the most charismatic humans on the planet, that\u2019s more than enough.\n\n14. Made in America (1993)\n\nThe concept of this movie is so inherently bizarre \u2014 Whoopi Goldberg discovers that the father of the child she conceived from a sperm donor is dumbass car salesman Ted Danson \u2014 that you look for any sort of escape. And you certainly find it in Smith, who plays the love interest of the daughter (Nia Long) with such movie-star charm that he practically leaps off the screen. He wouldn\u2019t have to play silly comic-relief supporting roles much longer, but, man, was he ever good at it. He\u2019s so exuberant and having such a blast that it almost makes you forget Goldberg\u2019s and Danson\u2019s real-life relationship. Almost.\n\n13. Hitch (2005)\n\nThe sort of dumb studio rom-com that goes as far as its star will take it, Hitch suggests what Smith\u2019s career might have been like if he\u2019d taken the Matthew McConaughey route. He plays a suave relationship adviser who counsels dorky Kevin James on how to talk to a pretty gal (Amber Valletta) \u2014 so, of course, he\u2019s nervous in his own life trying to woo assertive gossip columnist Eva Mendes! Yeah, like we said, Hitch is dumb, but it\u2019s dumb in a fluffy, appealing way, and Smith gets to work that 1,000-watt smile while playing the romantic lead \u2014 something he hasn\u2019t done much at the movies.\n\n12. Bad Boys (1995)\n\nSmith and director Michael Bay teamed up when both men were on a career upswing, and Bad Boys was the very appealing (and, yes, sorta racist and homophobic) result. This is where the Fresh Prince graduates to big-screen badass action hero, setting the stage for Independence Day, Men in Black and the title of King of the Fourth of July Blockbuster. What\u2019s funny about watching Bad Boys now: Dude seems so young, but his smartass chemistry with Martin Lawrence still shines.\n\n11. Gemini Man (2019)\n\nWill Smith is up for the challenge of battling (and of course eventually teaming up) with his 30-years-younger clone, but even he can\u2019t overcome this hoary, aging-hit-man story that\u2019s so tired that it\u2019s a borderline miracle he doesn\u2019t once say \u201cI\u2019m too old for this shit.\u201d (And don\u2019t get us started on Ang Lee\u2019s insistence on the accelerated FPS rate, which makes the whole thing look like the most expensive episode of As the World Turns ever.) Fortunately, Smith is still dedicated enough to sell the dynamic between his two selves, and there are even some moving moments in which you see him struggling to reckon with his younger self, both onscreen and off. But if you\u2019re going to re-create a young Will Smith \u2026 don\u2019t you have to make him more fun than this?\n\n10. Men in Black 3 (2012)\n\nThis was the first movie Smith made after 2008\u2019s Hancock and Seven Pounds, and the four years away from multiplexes only reminded us how much we loved the guy. Men in Black 3 washes away the bad memories of the 2002 sequel, pairing Smith mostly with Josh Brolin, who\u2019s playing Tommy Lee Jones\u2019s Agent K in the past. The time-jumping narrative and Brolin\u2019s spot-on Jones impression are the movie\u2019s highlights, which allows Smith to ease back into movie-star mode, supplying Agent J with endless cool and still-stellar comic timing.\n\n9. I, Robot (2004)\n\nA fairly basic thriller that hasn\u2019t aged particularly well \u2014 unlike the Isaac Asimov book it\u2019s based on \u2014 and feels compromised, not least of which by some truly bizarre product placement. Smith can play this sort of Wry Cop in his sleep, but he\u2019s a steadying force among all the chaos around him. He\u2019s also a surprisingly urgent action star: He\u2019s physical, sure, but also vulnerable and insistent. He makes it look easier than it is.\n\n8. Enemy of the State (1998)\n\nThis Tony Scott action-thriller came out during Smith\u2019s bulletproof period where he could do no wrong. (Spoiler alert: The following year\u2019s Wild Wild West would end that streak.) He\u2019s not the cool cat or the cocky showboat this time, though: He plays a mild-mannered lawyer mixed up in a government conspiracy, with only Gene Hackman\u2019s mysterious operative able to save him. Enemy of the State was Smith\u2019s dry run for the dramatic roles he would soon be pursuing, and he\u2019s commanding and sympathetic as a regular guy fighting for his life.\n\n7. Hancock (2008)\n\nSmith\u2019s nerviest blockbuster finds him playing a superhero who\u2019s also an asshole, and the actor seems tickled at the prospect of tweaking his own squeaky-clean image. Hancock doesn\u2019t always balance its desire to be a dark satire of comic-book movies with its need to deliver supersized, put-asses-in-the-seats spectacle. But Smith finds the nuance and pain in an all-powerful character who can save the world but can\u2019t get out of his own way.\n\n6. The Pursuit of Happyness (2006)\n\nOne of the hardest things for A-list stars to do is portray \u201cordinary\u201d people. (Stay too long in the limelight and you lose the common touch.) But Smith earned his second Best Actor nomination effortlessly playing Chris Gardner, who in the early 1980s fell into homelessness while raising his young son (Smith\u2019s own son Jaden). There\u2019s nothing showy in Smith\u2019s performance, which is crucial for a character who\u2019s been beaten down by life but still clings to a defiant optimism. Smith\u2019s obvious affection for his boy radiates through the screen.\n\n5. Six Degrees of Separation (1995)\n\nThis adaptation of John Guare\u2019s Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning play had all the Appeal to the Smart Upper East Side Crowd cachet a young actor looking to make a splash would want, but what\u2019s stunning is how much fire and passion Smith brings to the performance, at times wiping seasoned vets Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing right off the screen. Smith is a little mannered at first as a grifter who cons a cultured NYC couple into believing he\u2019s Sidney Poitier\u2019s son, but once his ruse is discovered, he, and the film, turn into something much more raw and searing. Even if you found Smith charming before this, his performance snapped you to attention: Wait, he can do this? In some ways, he hasn\u2019t quite challenged himself as much since.\n\n4. Independence Day (1996)\n\nThis sequel didn\u2019t bring back Smith, and it left a huge crater at its center: Would we have ever made this such a big hit, would we have ever cared so much, if it hadn\u2019t have been for Smith? The movie is fairly standard disaster-flick porn \u2014 albeit done in Roland Emmerich\u2019s harmlessly dumb style \u2014 but Smith springs it to life every time he shows up. No wonder he became such a July 4 star: This is America how we want to see ourselves, a little John Wayne, a little Muhammad Ali. Welcome to Earth!\n\n3. I Am Legend (2007)\n\nThe movie never quite figures out its ending \u2014 and the initial ending, from the book but rejected by test audiences, might have been a better place to land \u2014 but Smith is incredibly moving as a man who has lost everyone he loved and knew but still, in spite of himself, keeps trudging forward. It\u2019s a tricky performance, and its strength is in Smith\u2019s unwillingness to ever go for the easy out: You can tell he\u2019s invested in what a man like this would go through, and he appears legitimately damaged from it. Not everything in this movie works, but it might be Smith\u2019s most underappreciated performance.\n\n2. Ali (2001)\n\nMuhammad Ali\u2019s death may have brought newfound appreciation to this deeply moving, under-loved biopic, but the greatness of Smith\u2019s performance was never in dispute. Ali merges the two sides of this dynamic actor \u2014 the electric entertainer and the soulful dramatist \u2014 into one perfect whole, presenting the iconic boxer as the ultimate showman who was also sensitive to (and swept up in) the political and racial turmoil swirling around him. Earning his first Oscar nomination, Smith uses his charisma like a weapon, tapping into Ali\u2019s sting-like-a-bee magnetism.\n\n1. Men in Black (1997)\n\nSure, the man is a superb dramatic performer. But be honest: This is the movie \u2014 and character \u2014 you first think of when someone mentions Will Smith. Men in Black is a miracle of a blockbuster \u2014 a snazzy, funny, eye-popping sci-fi action movie \u2014 and Smith treats the whole enterprise like one big lark. No movie star makes blas\u00e9 irreverence feel hipper, just as no other movie star makes event movies feel like the coolest thing in the world. You know what? He did make this look good.\n\nGrierson & Leitch write about the movies regularly for the New Republic and host a podcast on film.
