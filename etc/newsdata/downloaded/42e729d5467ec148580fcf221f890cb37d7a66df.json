There\u2019s no real consolation in anything.\n\n\u201cWe have to move on to the next opportunity to put on this red jersey that means so much.\u201d\n\nWyn Jones is a Welsh rugby legend and is the most capped player in the nation\u2019s history, a record he passed with his 130th game in the pool matches against the Wallabies and is the world\u2019s most capped lock.\n\nBut the 34-year-old will continue after the World Cup, extending his career at least until 2021 with the national team.\n\nStill fans were feeling for the skipper after another deep run in the competition wasn\u2019t able to yield a trophy.\n\nA proper kick to the guts.

The third and fourth playoff is a tough game to play but you have to give it the respect it deserves.\n\n\u201cIt will be hugely monumental, it\u2019s the team I haven\u2019t beaten with Wales so it will be nice to be able to achieve that.\u201d\n\nWales are currently on a 30-game losing streak to New Zealand dating back to 1953.\n\nFormer Wales flanker Martyn Williams speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live said he thought Wales still had a bright future.\n\n\u201cI think Wales have a group of players there,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t see anyone retiring, not Alun Wyn Jones \u2014 I think he\u2019ll want to go to a fourth Lions tour \u2014 but it\u2019s not as if it\u2019s the end of an era. There\u2019s another World Cup in most of these players.\n\n\u201cWayne Pivac (the next Wales coach) has done a fantastic job down at Scarlets. He\u2019s been around, he\u2019s experienced, a lot of the team\u2019s still staying. The back team staff are staying on board.\u201d\n\nWales will play New Zealand for third place on Friday night.", "description": "Wales have fallen short once again after a third World Cup semi-final campaign ended with heartbreak at the hands of South Africa, losing 19-16.", "authors": ["Andrew Mcmurtry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/137b4d603eb3acb3a52f0bc55b548ac0?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
