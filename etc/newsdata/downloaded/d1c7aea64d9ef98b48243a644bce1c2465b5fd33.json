I hope he\u2019ll get it through Parliament, I suspect he will but it will be tight.\u2019\n\nMr Cameron, 53, was speaking at Harrogate\u2019s Crown Hotel on the first night of the town\u2019s literature festival to promote his book, For The Record.\n\nBoris Johnson to try and woo MPs to back his Brexit deal before Super Saturday\n\nFielding questions from the BBC\u2019s James Landale, the former PM said of the deal: \u2018At the end of the day, I think this is quite close to what was talked about in the 2017 manifesto, and it is a way of leaving with a deal, so I think that is the right thing to do.\n\n\u2018We can\u2019t go on being stuck. You can\u2019t rule out having a general election if Parliament cannot pass this deal and is still stuck, and you cannot rule out a second referendum.\u2019\n\nAsked about his relationship with Mr Johnson and whether they had nicknames for one another, Mr Cameron said that a friend had texted him earlier on Thursday to ask if the new Brexit deal would be voted through Parliament.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Cameron said he responded: \u2018The thing about the greased piglet is that he manages to slip through other people\u2019s hands where mere mortals fail.\u2019\n\nA small group of protesters had formed outside the hotel prior to Mr Cameron\u2019s talk, and he was repeatedly interrupted during the event.\n\nAt one stage, as he discussed the reasons for calling the 2016 referendum, one woman stood up and shouted: \u2018I think the good people of Harrogate came here to hear an apology from you.\u2019\n\nDriver fined \u00a3100 for parking over two bays while getting cash in empty car park\n\nAs other audience members responded with a mixture of angry boos and applause, a man called out: \u2018Apologise for ruining our country.\u2019\n\nIt came after he had described the three years following the referendum as \u2018very painful for the country\u2019.\n\nWhen Mr Cameron was at one stage discussing ways to unite the country following the division of the referendum, another man interrupted and shouted: \u2018Your policy of austerity did absolutely nothing to bring this country together.\u2019\n\nWhen the man spoke across him as he attempted to respond, the former Conservative party leader quipped: \u2018You can pay \u00a335 to shout at me in here, or you can shout at me outside for free afterwards.\u2019\n\nThe comment prompted cheers from the remaining members of the crowd.", "description": "He said: 'The thing about the greased piglet is that he manages to slip through other people's hands where mere mortals fail.'", "authors": ["Richard Hartley-Parkinson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI88524542-3a6b_1571381459.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
