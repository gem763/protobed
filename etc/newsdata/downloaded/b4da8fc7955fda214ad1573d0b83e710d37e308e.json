You will regret that you sold it. You don't know what you are doing. I like the stock.\"\n\nShopify said in June it planned to spend over $1 billion for more fulfillment centers to compete with Amazon and EBay. Total operating expenses in the third quarter rose to $252.4 million from $181.1 million a year earlier.\n\nThe EPS miss was driven largely by \"a significant one-time tax item,\" Colin Sebastian, senior research analyst at Baird, pointed out in a note on Tuesday.\n\nBaird has a 12-month price target of $410 on Shopify, which would represent a 36% gain.\n\nThe price target is derived from a \"combination of 16x our 2021E revenue estimate and a multi-year DCF, near the high end of SaaS valuations (20x+ 2020E sales), which we believe is warranted given Shopify's scale, massive market opportunity, and engineering sophistication,\" Sebastian said.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.", "description": "Shares of Canadian e-commerce company Shopify dropped after reporting a surprise loss on earnings.", "authors": ["Yun Li"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103390615-GettyImages-496745802.jpg?v=1550071028", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
