Quantum computers are still a long way from having a practical application but might one day revolutionize tasks that would take existing computers years, including the hunt for new drugs. CNET reported they could also create solar panels, help develop artificial intelligence and self-driving cars, and even manage investment portfolios.\n\nThe technique relies on quantum bits, or qubits, which can register data values of zero and one \u2013 the language of modern computing \u2013 simultaneously. Big tech companies including Google, Microsoft, IBM and Intel are avidly pursuing the technology.\n\n\"Quantum things can be in multiple places at the same time,\" said Chris Monroe, a University of Maryland physicist who is also the founder of quantum startup IonQ. \"The rules are very simple, they're just confounding.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump last year signed into law a congressional proposal to spend $1.2 billion over five years for quantum research across the federal government. Google's research was centered at a University of California, Santa Barbara laboratory but relied in part on a Department of Energy supercomputer and experts at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to verify the work.\n\nIvanka Trump, the president's daughter and adviser, on Wednesday called Google's breakthrough a \"remarkable scientific achievement\" that will help usher in future U.S. industries. \"We're proud to have contributed to this major milestone,\" she tweeted.\n\nIt\u2019s official! \ud83d\udca5 The US has achieved quantum supremacy!\n\nIn a collaboration between the Trump Admin, @Google and UC Santa Barbara, quantum computer Sycamore has completed a calculation in 3 min 20 sec that would take about 10,000 years for a classical comp. pic.twitter.com/YBv2TPCP1A \u2014 Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) October 23, 2019\n\nGoogle's findings, however, are already facing pushback from other industry researchers. A version of Google's paper leaked online last month and researchers caught a glimpse before it was taken down.\n\nIBM quickly took issue with Google's claim that it had achieved \"quantum supremacy,\" a term that refers to a point when a quantum computer can perform a calculation that a traditional computer can't complete within its lifetime. Google's leaked paper showed that its quantum processor, Sycamore, finished a calculation in three minutes and 20 seconds \u2013 and that it would take the world's fastest supercomputer 10,000 years to do the same thing.\n\nBut IBM researchers say that Google underestimated the conventional supercomputer, called Summit, and said it could actually do the calculation in 2.5 days. Summit was developed by IBM and is located at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.\n\nGoogle has not commented on IBM's claims.\n\nWhether or not Google has achieved \"quantum supremacy\" or not may matter to competitors, but the semantics could be less important for the field of quantum research. What it does seem to indicate is that the field is maturing.\n\n\"The quantum supremacy milestone allegedly achieved by Google is a pivotal step in the quest for practical quantum computers,\" John Preskill, a Caltech professor who originally coined the \"quantum supremacy\" term, wrote in a column after the paper was leaked.\n\nIt means quantum computing research can enter a new stage, he wrote, though a significant effect on society \"may still be decades away.\"\n\nThe calculation employed by Google has little practical use, Preskill wrote, other than to test how well the processor works. Monroe echoed that concern.\n\n\"The more interesting milestone will be a useful application,\" he said.\n\nThe promise of such future applications in commerce and national security has attracted interest from governments including the United States and China that are increasingly investing in the expensive basic research needed to make quantum computers useful. One feared outcome of quantum computing \u2013 though experts say it's likely still decades away \u2013 is a computer powerful enough to break today's best cryptography.", "description": "Google's findings, however, are already facing pushback from other industry researchers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/23/cb68b410-768c-40f0-8e73-a1afec568405/thumbnail/1200x630/f538a70372fff4213f6fa0a1217e4aa6/google-quantum-kws9fbz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
