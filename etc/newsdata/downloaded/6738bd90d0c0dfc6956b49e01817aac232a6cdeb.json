The cryptocurrency project, first announced in June with backing from major financial industry players, lost the support of Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and other established payments and technology companies earlier this month. The companies walked back their initial commitments to join the Libra Association, a Switzerland-based organization that will be tasked with managing the digital currency.\n\nLibra has been unable to escape the political baggage piling up at Facebook, which is under fire for privacy missteps, facilitating foreign interference in U.S. elections and its handling of political ads.\n\nThe climate on Capitol Hill has turned hostile to big tech. With that backdrop, Facebook has said in recent days that it no longer plans to be the face of Libra and that its Libra Association partners will take on a more prominent role in defending the project.\n\n\"I believe this is something that needs to get built, but I understand we\u2019re not the ideal messenger right now,\" Zuckerberg said in his prepared testimony. \"We\u2019ve faced a lot of issues over the past few years, and I\u2019m sure people wish it was anyone but Facebook putting this idea forward.\"\n\nZuckerberg will try to appeal to lawmakers' sense of patriotism in his defense of Libra, which regulators have warned could pose serious risks to consumers and the broader financial system.\n\n\"While we debate these issues, the rest of the world isn\u2019t waiting,\" he said. \"China is moving quickly to launch similar ideas in the coming months. Libra will be backed mostly by dollars and I believe it will extend America\u2019s financial leadership as well as our democratic values and oversight around the world. If America doesn\u2019t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed.\"\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6e/4c/a1b8f5714a89865c78248a5a11f8/20191014-zuckerberg-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
