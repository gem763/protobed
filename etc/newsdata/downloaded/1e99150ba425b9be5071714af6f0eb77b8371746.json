USADA said it received information from 30 witnesses.\n\nUK Athletics had done its own investigation into Salazar and given Farah, who runs for Britain, the OK to continue working with him. Farah parted ways with Salazar in 2017, saying he wanted to move back home.\n\nSalazar also coached 2012 Olympic silver medalist Galen Rupp. Salazar, Rupp and Farah have, in the past, strongly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nUSADA said it relied on more than 2,000 exhibits between the two cases and that proceedings included nearly 5,800 pages of transcripts.\n\n\u201cThe athletes in these cases found the courage to speak out and ultimately exposed the truth,\u201d USADA CEO Travis Tygart said. \u201cWhile acting in connection with the Nike Oregon Project, Mr. Salazar and Dr. Brown demonstrated that winning was more important than the health and wellbeing of the athletes they were sworn to protect.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Track coach Alberto Salazar, who trained four-time Olympic champion Mo Farah and a number of other top runners, has been given a four-year ban in a case pursued by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eddie Pells"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/salaza_doping_10106_c0-364-3774-2564_s1770x1032.jpg?94028ec9a52fb0244bd22172ab4193d919b849ab", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
