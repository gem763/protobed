It is a pity that the heavyweight Pakistan batting line-up were unable to chase a modest score of 168 runs set by an inexperienced B-team of Sri Lanka. What was surprising was the ease with which Sri Lanka shut Pakistan's chase down. Pakistan needs to win this one to stay afloat in the series.\n\nTv telecast and online streaming info\n\nThe proceeding can be watched Live on PTV Sports tv channel in Pakistan with live stream available at the official site.

There was no way the hosts to get back up and win from there. Umar Akmal who got out for a first-ball duck, has not made a T20 fifty since February 2016.\n\nBut Pakistan is known for coming back after losing the initial match.\n\nPakistan have never lost a bilateral T20 series to Sri Lanka.\n\nIn another international match, India beat South Africa in the first Test match by a massive 200 plus runs. Rohit Sharma created a record of sorts after scoring centuries in each innings as an opener.", "description": "Viewers in India can watch on the Pak vs SL 2nd Twenty20 live on Sony Six with stream on Sonyliv.com.
