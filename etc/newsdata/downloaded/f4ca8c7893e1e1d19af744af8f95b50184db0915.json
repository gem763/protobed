James Mattis, his former defense secretary, \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general\u201d and said he wasn\u2019t \u201ctough enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was obvious that the meeting was going to get angrier and more defensive. And we felt that the meeting was no longer a meeting in which we thought we would get useful discussion and results. And so we left,\u201d Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters.\n\nPelosi told reporters outside the White House that Trump\u2019s behavior was \u201cvery sad.\u201d Soon after that, Trump posted a series of photos from the meeting, mockingly asking in one, \u201cDo you think they like me?\u201d and accusing Pelosi herself of having an \u201cunhinged meltdown\u201d in another.\n\nDo you think they like me? pic.twitter.com/TDmUnJ8HtF \u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2019\n\nPelosi appeared unfazed by Trump\u2019s outburst, and one of the photos quickly appeared on her own Twitter profile page as a badge of honor.\n\n\u201cThanks for the new cover photo @realDonaldTrump!\u201d tweeted Drew Hammill, Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff.\n\nTrump continued his Twitter attack into the night. After Pelosi, back at the Capitol, told reporters: \u201cI pray for the president all the time . . . Now, we have to pray for his health \u2014 because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.\u201d\n\nThat spurred Trump to tweet: \u201cNancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her \u201cupstairs,\u201d or she just plain doesn\u2019t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person!\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump went on a Twitter tirade late Wednesday, tweeting photos of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that were taken during a contentious White...", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT471_pelosi_ZG_20191016193910.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
