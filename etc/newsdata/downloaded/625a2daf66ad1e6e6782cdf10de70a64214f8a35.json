Taylor that the release of military aid to Ukraine was contingent on that country\u2019s government making a public declaration that it would investigate former vice president Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and interference in the 2016 election.\n\nAD\n\nTaylor\u2019s testimony had been highly anticipated ever since it was revealed that he sent this text to two other U.S. diplomats: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCrazy is one word for it. Impeachable is another.\n\nEmerging reports suggest that Democrats are zeroing in on a single \u201cabuse of power\u201d impeachment count, based on President Trump\u2019s attempts to strong-arm Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into delivering dirt on Biden, a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThis is a savvy strategy for several reasons.\n\nFirst, the strategy adheres to the \u201ckeep it simple, stupid\u201d maxim that any experienced prosecutor learns. The task of constructing a winning white-collar case typically can involve paring back voluminous evidence and choosing a compelling and easily understood theme to relentlessly hammer home in front of the jury.\n\nAD\n\nSecond, it blunts the Republicans\u2019 apparent strategy of confusing matters by arguing legalisms such as \u201cno quid pro quo,\u201d which Trump\u2019s defenders have begun to make into a drumbeat.\n\nAD\n\nActually, on the facts and under the law, there appears to be plenty of quo for the quid \u2014 Taylor\u2019s testimony powerfully bolsters the case that the president aimed to hold up military aid, as well as the valuable prospect of a presidential meeting, to induce Zelensky to do his political bidding. But this is a disadvantageous argument for Democrats \u2014 not because they\u2019re wrong, but because it plays into a Republican strategy of sowing legal doubt. If the Democrats fight on that field, and enough Trump loyalists intone \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d on Fox News and on the House floor, the idea that the evidence doesn\u2019t quite meet the necessary legal requirements could take hold with undecided voters.\n\nBy contrast, an abuse-of-power theme largely takes arcane legal arguments off the table. Who cares whether Latin scholars or appellate judges would be satisfied by the connection between withholding military aid and political dirt? In real-world terms, it\u2019s easy to understand what Trump was after, and why it was inconsistent with his constitutional responsibilities.\n\nAD\n\nIt is likewise apparent that the White House\u2019s strategy has been to obstruct the inquiry at every turn. It would be sensible for that obstruction to be a separate count of impeachment.\n\nAD\n\nThird and most important, the focus on abuse of power best gets at what is repugnant about Trump\u2019s conduct. The apparent Ukrainian shakedown is precisely the sort that the framers used to justify the political remedy of impeachment.\n\nIf the allegations prove true, it was rank abuse coming and going: Trump sought to commandeer public funds designed to secure the country\u2019s global security interests and use them instead to induce a foreign country to interfere in our election by providing negative information against his political opponent. That\u2019s several levels of scummy.\n\nAD\n\nAnd the Democrats are being thoughtful not only in conceiving the theory of the case, but in assembling the evidence to serve it. Taylor is but the latest example of a credible witness who will reinforce the basic theme around which the majority is coalescing. And, presumably, the House Intelligence Committee is assembling this evidence behind closed doors with an eye toward constructing for the whole country an overwhelming account of the president\u2019s abuse of power.\n\nAD\n\nOn that day, the Trump loyalist cries of \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d will sound silly.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "They appear to be assembling a meticulous and tightly focused case against the president.", "authors": ["Harry Litman", "Contributing Columnist Focused On Legal Issues", "Contributing Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xWl3eAkVbXX7SmjE8e3OippmWpo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AOKRTCA2KNF3HMWOGVFWEMY5A4", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
