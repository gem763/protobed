And if you have some sort of skills that can be applied, you have a better chance at employment.\n\nMasai School is a startup in Bangalore looking to tackle just that. They're offering coding-centric learning programs, designed to train and mould learners into skilled professionals ready for the modern work climate.\n\nWhat makes them different from any coaching class though, is that their main focus seems to be in upskilling people in lower economic groups. Specifically, they want to help people that can't afford it, learn how to perform higher level jobs.\n\nDon't Miss 180 SHARES 173 SHARES 3.3 K SHARES\n\nMasai School was founded by Prateek Shukla, Yogesh Bhat, and Nrupul Dev. They just commenced their first batch earlier in June, five month-long high intensity full-stack web development program. Alongside that, they also provided participants with lessons on personality development and soft skills coaching. The school uses a combination of in-class and online programs, so already engaged workers can find the chance to scale up their capabilities.\n\nHis impregnable urge to learn and dedication stirred us all.\n\nI am proud to announce that in his 17th week, Mahesh has been placed as a Full Stack Developer at almost 4 times the package he couldn't crack earlier. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nSurreal? Too good to be true? (2/3) \u2014 Prateek Shukla (@pratshukla) 4 October 2019\n\nMost importantly though, students don't need to pay up front. Masai School is seed-funded, so it can provide training to people at no initial cost. Instead, they sign an income share agreement, so they pay Masai 15 percent of their salary over the first three years of employment to cover the training. And that too is enforced only if they're earning more than Rs 6 lakh per annum, with the overall fees for the school capped at Rs 3 lakh.\n\nThe idea is Masai School wants lower-skilled workers to gain the capabilities needed to secure employment in the tech industry, without being disadvantaged by a lack of pertinent education.\n\n\"India today has the world's largest IT workforce, and growing. Each year, thousands of engineering colleges churn out lakhs of graduates, but the reality is that not even half are job ready. With organizations today giving priority to skill-set rather than educational background, there is a wide skill gap that exists. This is where we created Masai School. We believe that focused skill development is the way forward,\" Shukla says.\n\nIn an era where big technology companies like Apple and IBM are saying on record that a degree isn't an absolute necessity for IT jobs, it's good to see educational startups like Masai School trying to re-imagine what education means for the current generation in terms of getting people decent paying jobs.", "description": "As technology marches ever onward, it influences more than just how convenient it becomes to do certain things.
