Instability and uncertainty are increasing,' a customs agency spokesman, Li Kuiwen, said at a news conference.\n\nTit-for-tat tariff hikes on billions of dollars of each other's goods have battered manufacturers and farmers on both sides and disrupted supply chains worldwide.\n\nUncertainty has prompted some companies to postpone investments, adding to downward pressure on global growth and fueling financial market jitters.\n\nChina's global exports fell 1.4 percent from a year earlier to $218.1 billion. Imports fell 5.8 percent to $178.5 billion.\n\nThe slump adds to pressure on President Xi Jinping's government to shore up cooling economic growth and prevent politically risky job losses.\n\nChinese growth fell to its lowest level in at least 26 years in the quarter ending in June, decelerating to 6.2 percent over a year earlier.\n\nThe slump adds to pressure on President Xi Jinping's government to shore up cooling economic growth and prevent politically risky job losses\n\nTrump agreed to put off an additional tariff hike planned for this week on Chinese imports\n\nTrump shakes hands with Chinese Vice Premier Liu on Friday after being given a letter in the Oval Office of the White House\n\nForecasters expect growth in the July-September quarter, due to be reported this week, to fall further to as low as 5.9 percent, sinking below the ruling Communist Party's official target for the year of at least 6 percent.\n\n'While import growth should start to recover soon, it will take longer before export growth bottoms out,' said Martin Lynge Rasmussen of Capital Economics in a report. 'The mini U.S.-China trade deal reached on Friday doesn't alter the outlook significantly.'\n\nThe country's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States contracted by 16.5 percent from a year earlier but stood at $25.9 billion.\n\nIncreased exports to Britain and other European countries and developing markets such as Vietnam helped to offset some of the losses. China's global trade surplus expanded by 42.2 percent to $39.7 billion.\n\nPassengers shop at the Shanghai Disney flagship store at the Hongqiao Railway Station in Shanghai, China on Monday\n\nFor the first nine months of the year, Chinese imports of American goods were off 26.4 percent at $90.6 billion.

But Washington still is planning a Dec. 15 tariff hike on $160 billion of smartphones and other imports.\n\nBefore then, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are due to attend an economic conference in Chile in mid-November. That is raising hopes a face-to-face meeting might produce progress.\n\nTalks broke down in May over Beijing's insistence that Trump's punitive tariffs had to be lifted once a deal took effect. Washington says some must remain in place to ensure Chinese compliance.
