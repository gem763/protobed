I thought the worst and that we were going to lose our little girl.\n\n\"I really believed this was just a bad case of sickness.\n\n(Image: Portsmouth News/Solent News)\n\n\"The doctor took a breath and told us that 'Isla is very, very poorly, much more sick than we thought'.\n\n\"From this moment on, everything the doctor said felt like a bad dream. Isla had kidney failure. Her kidneys did not function at all and her body wasn't able to cope.\n\n\"This turned into a matter of life or death.\"\n\nE.coli is a bacteria found in the gut and faeces of many animals, particularly cattle.\n\nIt can be caught by eating contaminated food, touching infected animals and contact with people who have the illness.\n\nPublic Health England said it is investigating the source of the infection.\n\nLauren added: \"I was so pleased we had an answer and knew what has caused the failure, but I'm very concerned that we are yet to find out where the E.coli was contracted from, and there is a high chance other people can be putting themselves at risk.\n\n(Image: Portsmouth News/Solent News)\n\n(Image: Portsmouth News/Solent News)\n\n\"No matter how much someone warns you how scary things will look, it will never prepare you for the moment you see your child in that way, reliant on machines to function and to breathe.\n\n\"She still has E.coli 0157 and isn't allowed back to school until she has had two clear stool samples confirmed by Public Health.\n\n\"She will most likely face problems in the future when she hits puberty and pregnancy, and her future prognosis is still unknown.\n\n\"I pray no one else's son or daughter has to face what Isla has faced, and I really hope we can raise awareness to other parents about this horrible bacteria that has been so innocently contracted.\"\n\nDr Anand Fernandes, consultant in health protection for Public Health England South East, said: \"E.coli O157 can cause a range of symptoms, from mild diarrhoea to severe abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea and, on rare occasions, it can also cause more serious conditions.\n\n\"The best for of defence is to make sure you thoroughly wash your hands before preparing or eating food, or if you have been in contract with any animal or their faeces.\n\n\"Anyone who suspects they may have a diarrhoeal illness should drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration and if they have severe symptoms like bloody diarrhoea they should contact NHS 111 or their GP surgery.\"", "description": "Isla Grainger, from Fareham, had to be put in an induced coma after catching the deadly infection on a trip to the Isle of Wight", "authors": ["Pippa Allen-Kinross", "Image", "Portsmouth News Solent News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20565012.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
