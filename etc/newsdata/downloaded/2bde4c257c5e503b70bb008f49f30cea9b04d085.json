There are quite a few of them out there to choose from these days, with two of the most popular being Amazon\u2019s Ring system and Google\u2019s Nest. They\u2019ve been growing in popularity, particularly in suburban neighborhoods. This has been abetted by hundreds of local police departments going so far as to subsidize or even give away Ring systems to homeowners in an attempt to gain access to more video surveillance footage when investigating crimes.\n\nThis partnership with law enforcement feeds into Ring\u2019s social networking app called Neighborhood, where members of the community can share footage and reports of crime or suspicious activity. The police can request the footage from willing participants without a warrant because the sharing of the videos is not mandatory. Plenty of people are still sharing, however. This has led to the usual complaints about privacy concerns, misidentification, and even racism, as you might expect.\n\nOver at Wired, Louise Matsakis has a lengthy analysis of how these camera systems are changing our culture. She does a good job offering data on both sides of the debate, both in terms of effects on crime rates and the aforementioned privacy concerns. On the latter point, she brings up some peculiar complaints, specifically in terms of questions as to whether this filming activity is actually doing anyone any good.\n\nOften at the heart of Ring news reports is one thing: passivity. Because many of the videos were filmed when the cameras owners were out of town, at work, or sleeping, there\u2019s little they could have done to change the course of what transpired in them, at least in the moment. The man whose camera filmed a girl with a dog at almost 4 am couldn\u2019t go and ask if she was OK. The feeling is best encapsulated in a clip from North Carolina earlier this year, in which a Ring camera captured a tornado destroying the residence it was installed on. The couple who owned the house, who weren\u2019t inside, watched as it was ravaged\u2014at least until the connection was lost.\n\nThis \u201cpassivity\u201d argument seems to me to be one of the most specious of them all. Take the examples that the author provides in that excerpt. A film clip of a little girl walking a dog at four in the morning isn\u2019t all that interesting in and of itself. But if she was in trouble and the owners couldn\u2019t help her because they were sleeping, that doesn\u2019t invalidate the system. Let\u2019s say in a worst-case scenario that the girl went missing. Police could still use the video and its timestamp to at least confirm someplace she was before disappearing and establish a timeline of events to help solve the mystery.\n\nAs for the homeowners who watched from afar as a tornado approached and then destroyed their house, what could they (or anyone) have done about it had they been there? We don\u2019t have a way to stop or deflect tornados. But if they had been home and awake, perhaps they\u2019d have seen the twister approaching a few minutes earlier and had time to flee to safety.\n\nThe article also goes into the question of whether or not you\u2019re allowed to film things that aren\u2019t taking place on your own property. That\u2019s not even an issue anywhere in the country as far as I know. Anyone can take pictures or video of things going on out in public spaces, whether with their phone or an installed surveillance system. The only restrictions come into play if the owner of the video attempts to use someone else\u2019s image for profit without their permission. Simply having the video, or even sharing it on social media or with the police is not going to land you in court to the best of my knowledge.\n\nAlso, these systems have settings where you can limit the range of the motion detectors and the angle of the lens. So if you really don\u2019t want to film beyond the edge of your property you don\u2019t have to.\n\nThis technology is not only helping police solve crimes more quickly, but it arguably reduces overall crime if potential porch pirates and car thieves become aware that a given neighborhood is constantly being filmed. How anyone sees this as a bad thing remains a mystery to me.", "description": "Ding Dong.
