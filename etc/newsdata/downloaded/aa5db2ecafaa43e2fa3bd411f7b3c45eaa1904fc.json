I literally thought in that delivery room that I would somehow be 'less than' as mother for tapping out and asking for the drugs. Like there would be a gold medal or AT LEAST a gold sticker on my medical chart for having a natural birth. And I felt like I was letting some invisible committee down when we bought formula to help him pass the amniotic fluid he had swallowed.\"\n\nGibson told \"GMA\" she's surprised by how many times her post has been shared.\n\n\"If I could have chosen a photo of myself to go viral it wouldn't be one of my four days postpartum,\" she laughed. \"But it's been great to hear that the post helped some moms heal in a way or just that it was something they needed to hear.\"\n\nGibson's continued to think of her husband's words as she enjoys the journey of parenting her third boy. \"It's been so much fun,\" she said. \"I've been able to relax into it.\"\n\nHer advice to new moms: \"You really have to trust your gut. People have all sorts of advice, but no one knows your specific situation.\"", "description": "Husband reminds his wife there's 'no trophy' in parenting in viral Facebook post.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/191001ashleygibsonnotrohiesviralpostmain_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
