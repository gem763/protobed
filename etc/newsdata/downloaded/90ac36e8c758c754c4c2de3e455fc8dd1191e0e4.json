Fed\u2019s Evans Is Open-Minded on Rate Cut Despite Weak Industry\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Chicago Federal Reserve chief Charles Evans said the recent weakness in manufacturing hasn\u2019t yet convinced him to cut interest rates again given many of the U.S. economy\u2019s fundamentals are solid.\n\nMarkets have increased bets on a quarter-point rate reduction at the Fed\u2019s Oct. 29-30 meeting after disappointing figures this week. The U.S. ISM factory index dropped to a decade-low and job growth came in below expectations.\n\nYet in a Bloomberg Television interview on Thursday, Evans said U.S. consumer spending and the labor market remained strong and that \u201cI\u2019m open minded about the decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether one more rate cut at this point is the right decision or not, I think we\u2019re just going to have to go into the meeting and see,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is how accommodative we need to be. At the moment it\u2019s still risk management.\u201d\n\nOne of the next big data points comes Friday, when the Labor Department will release payrolls for September. The report, which could be key to the Fed in evaluating the outlook, is expected to show a 148,000 increase, compared with 130,000 in August.\n\nThere\u2019s a \u201cpretty good growth outlook,\u201d Evans said. \u201cThe question is whether or not we\u2019re going to be able to navigate the uncertainties and some of the shocks that come our way and get that growth path.\u201d\n\nEvans, a dove who backed rate cuts in July and September, said he was worried about the inflation outlook and would like to push the rate above the 2% target for a while to balance the long period of undershooting.\n\nThat way, \u201cyou\u2019d be more assured you\u2019d get to 2 if you found headwinds.\u201d", "description": "Fed\u2019s Evans Is Open-Minded on Rate Cut Despite Weak Industry", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEEAJ00C_L.jpg"}
