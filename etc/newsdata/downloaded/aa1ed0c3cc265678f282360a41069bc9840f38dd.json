Even if it does face difficulties in the leadership transition, the underlying ideology and the sectarian hatred it promoted remains attractive to many.\n\nWhere once they rode around in armoured vehicles, brandished rifles, flew black flags and indulged in acts of spectacular cruelty, the Sunni Muslim militants are now prisoners or scattered stragglers whose leader was chased down in a tunnel during a raid by American special forces.\n\n\u201cOperationally it doesn\u2019t affect much, they are already broken and globally their attacks have receded,\u201d said Rashad Ali, resident senior fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based think-tank. \u201cThey are mostly concentrated in the Iraqi-Syria borderlands.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make much of a difference other than the symbolism,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think taking out one terrorist (matters) while failing to address the root causes that led this ideology to take hold, you are mistaken.\u201d\n\nBut some of those grievances are very much on show today. Sunni Muslims in Iraq are angered at their treatment by a ruling Shi\u2019ite elite they see as under the influence of Iran and the Iranian-backed militias that now roam their provinces unchecked.\n\nRECRUITMENT\n\nIn Syria, recruitment to groups such as Islamic State is encouraged by the killing of Sunnis by Syrian government forces backed by Iran and Russia.\n\nIslamic State\u2019s effectiveness arises from its members\u2019 loyalty to its ultra-fanatical Islamist ideology, and this may not be much affected by the killing of its leader, said Fadhil Abu Ragheef, an Iraqi political analyst and security expert.\n\nHe said Islamic State\u2019s 9-man Shura Council, or leadership group, was expected to meet and appoint a leader from among five candidates.\n\nAmong the front runners are Abu Abdullah al-Jizrawi, a Saudi, and Abdullah Qaradash, an Iraqi and one of Baghdadi\u2019s right-hand men, also a former army officer under Saddam Hussein. Also mentioned is Abu Othman al-Tunisi, a Tunisian.\n\n\u201cThe new leader will start working to pull together the group\u2019s power by relying on new recruits and fighters who fled the prisons in Syria. He is expected to launch a series of retaliatory attacks for the killing of Baghdadi,\u201d said Abu Ragheef.\n\nIt is possible that whoever takes over as the head of the group, which experts say has been beset by internal disputes, will cause it to splinter within months because he is unacceptable on grounds of nationality to some factions.\n\n\u201cFor sure they will fight among themselves over resources. I predict the Iraqi faction will win because they have more money,\u201d said Iraqi analyst Hisham al-Hashemi, an expert on jihadist groups.\n\nA security source with knowledge of militant groups in Iraq said the killing of Baghdadi would splinter the group\u2019s command structure because of differences between senior figures and lack of confidence among group members who were forced to go underground when the caliphate collapsed.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that killing Baghdadi will not lead to the disappearance of Islamic State because eventually they will pick someone for the job,\u201d the source said. \u201cBut at same time whoever follows Baghdadi will not be in a position to keep the group united.\u201d\n\nOPERATIONS\n\nThe new leader will attempt to restructure the group by encouraging followers to launch operations not only in Iraq but in other countries to raise morale among existing and new followers, the source said.\n\nBy franchising its name, Islamic State has attracted followers in Africa, Asia and Europe. Incidents such as one in London, where attackers used easily obtained weapons such as motor vehicles and knives, show that lack of organisational backing is not an obstacle.\n\nIn South East Asia, where Islamic State has spread its influence, officials believe the group\u2019s ideas will have to be fought even after Baghdadi\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cHis death will have little impact here as the main problem remains the spread of the Islamic State ideology,\u201d Malaysian police counter-terrorism chief Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWhat we are most worried about now are \u2018lone wolf\u2019 attacks and those who are self-radicalised through the internet. We are still seeing the spread of IS teachings online. IS publications and magazines from years ago are being reproduced and re-shared,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Iraq, where Baghdadi proclaimed his caliphate from the Grand al-Nuri Mosque in 2014, authorities have pursued a policy of taking out senior Islamic State figures as an effective way of keeping the group on the back foot.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Iraqi youth watch the news of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi death, in Najaf, Iraq October 27, 2019. REUTERS/Alaa al-Marjani\n\nHashemi argues that more is needed.\n\n\u201cThey have the ability to regroup. The way to stop that is through real fostering of democracy and civil society, truly addressing grievances, in short, creating an environment that repels terrorism,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cKilling leaders is definitely a good thing but it does not prevent their return, only creating such an environment does,\u201d he added.", "description": "The killing of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is of considerable importance, experts believe, but the underlying reasons for his jihadist group's existence remain and attacks in the Middle East and beyond are not likely to stop.", "authors": ["Ahmed Rasheed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1446004692&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1H0", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
