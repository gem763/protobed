They are stories that capture everything that is funny and captivating and peculiar about this person onstage. For Nate Bargatze, it\u2019s his joke about seeing a dead horse.\n\nSee, it\u2019s hard to pin down what makes Bargatze funny, but whatever it is, it\u2019s all in that six-minute story. At a glance, Bargatze\u2019s an unassuming, 40-year-old white guy with an easy southern drawl. His even, measured cadence and clean material are enough to convince a casual listener that he\u2019ll carry on indefinitely in his gentle way, and there are absolutely no surprises forthcoming. Then, without any obvious tell, Bargatze sidles up to a punch line. Listen to Bargatze once, and its evident how well he exploits an audience\u2019s presumptions about his un-remarkability, and how easily he can put them right where he wants them. He is the son of a magician, after all.\n\nThis great joke, which was in Bargatze\u2019s Netflix special, The Tennessee Kid, is the subject of this week\u2019s Good One, Vulture\u2019s podcast about jokes and the people who tell them. Read a short excerpt from the conversation or listen below. Download the episode from Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Overcast, or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nThere are phrases in the dead-horse joke, like \u201cspill the beans,\u201d that are both childlike and formal. Can you talk about your approach to writing when you know you don\u2019t curse and how it makes you a more specific writer?\n\nYou just end up saying words differently. Sometimes, I don\u2019t know what words you\u2019re supposed to say. So whatever comes out first is just the one I\u2019ll end up going with, and then if it works and I just keep saying it that way. I say \u201creal good\u201d a lot. No one says real good. By not cursing, I\u2019m having to do a word that maybe is longer than a quick curse word. It changes the whole rhythm of that sentence and then it affects the entire way you tell the joke. If everybody\u2019s dirty, if it\u2019s a topic everybody\u2019s done, I want to do it a different way.\n\nYour comedy seems to acknowledge the existence of magic while grounding it in everyday experience. How much of this do you think is due to your dad\u2019s professional life?\n\nI say it in this special where I was like, \u201cI just thought everybody\u2019s dad was a clown.\u201d Now me doing this, in comedy \u2014 when my daughter sees my Netflix special or on The Tonight Show, it\u2019s not a crazy thing. This is all she\u2019s known. So, yeah, my dad being a magician, but also starting as a clown, it was very normal. I come from a very normal family in the sense of everyday life, but we do these things that are very not normal. It\u2019s a mix of those two worlds. I never talked about it at the beginning. I was just like, Why would I talk about that? He\u2019s a magician. That\u2019s just what he does.\n\nThough you started in Chicago and New York, you live in Nashville now. What does it mean to you to be a southern comedian?\n\nThe Nashville scene has definitely gotten bigger. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily because of me \u2014 Nashville is doing very good as a city on its own \u2014 but it means a lot. It\u2019s nice to show new southern comics that they can do it, and that we\u2019re not just bumbling rednecks. Jeff Foxworthy doesn\u2019t get enough credit. The nicest guy in the world and an unbelievable storyteller. I just watched him a month or two ago. When people think like it\u2019s some trick or like, \u201cHe\u2019s just the redneck story guy dumbing it down,\u201d you\u2019re always like, \u201cIf it\u2019s just this simple trick, then you go do it and be a success.\u201d There\u2019s way more to it than that.\n\nI want to be a southern comic, I want to be a guy from Nashville, but I would always be sensitive to that stuff at the beginning. You want to stand out and then get above where you\u2019re from, in a way. You don\u2019t want someone to come to this show and be like, \u201cOh, this is blue-collar kid.\u201d You want it to be like, talk about family, talk about being married. But it means a lot to be kind of a flag, like, We\u2019re funny down here. To show that there\u2019s a lot of funny southern comedians.\n\nIn the special you tell the audience the message is that you don\u2019t think things through; then you say, \u201cIt\u2019s not. There\u2019s no message.\u201d So what do you want the audience to walk away with?\n\nI don\u2019t want to change anybody\u2019s mind about anything. I don\u2019t have it in me to offend people, or to push the envelope. Everything\u2019s about just being funny and telling the joke. It\u2019s just being like, \u201cAlways remember I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d And saying it over and over again to be like, \u201cHey, like don\u2019t like write me and be mad at me.\u201d I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t do anything, but I have zero education. I\u2019m just having a little fun making fun of these little things. Bill Burr says \u201cWhat do I know?\u201d a lot because then he can say what he wants. Maybe some people think, Oh, you are stupid, but it\u2019s funny you\u2019re that stupid. You take it however you want to take it. There\u2019s other comics that are trying to change your mind. If you want an opinion on something, there\u2019s so much of that. So go get that. But if you want a break and just sit and laugh and mind your own business and point and laugh at me cause I\u2019m stupid, then I\u2019m not bad to be sitting and waiting for.", "description": "On this week\u2019s \u201cGood One,\u201d Nate Bargatze discusses being a southern comedian, not cursing, and one of the all-time funny jokes.", "authors": ["Jesse David Fox"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/27/27-nate-bargatze-good-one-podcast-lede.w1200.h630.jpg"}
