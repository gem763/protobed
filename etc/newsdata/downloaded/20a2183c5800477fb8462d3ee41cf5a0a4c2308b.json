Sorry.\"\n\nITV\n\n\"What's the sadness for you?\" Morgan asks.\n\n\"To be the number one and he don't see nothing, he doesn't see me receive awards.\"\n\n\"He never saw how great you became,\" Morgan adds.\n\n\"No,\" Ronaldo says. \"Never. My family see, my mum, my brothers, even my old son, but my father, he didn't see nothing.\"\n\nAccording to Metro, Ronaldo adds: \"I think the interview would be funny, but I didn't expect to cry. But I never saw these images. I don't know where you ... I have to have these images to show my family.\n\n\"But I really don't know my father 100%. He was a drunk person. I never spoke with him, like a normal conversation. It was hard.\"\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Ronaldo opens up about life with his girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez, who he met in a Gucci store.\n\n\"Gio is part of me, she helped me so much,\" he says. \"I'm in love for her, and I'm so passion for her.

You have a girlfriend, you have a family, you have kids. When they play with your honesty, it's bad, it's hard.\"\n\n\"I remember one day I was at home in the living room with my girlfriend zapping the television to see the news and they speak about 'Cristiano Ronaldo this and that,' you listen to your kids coming down the stairs and you change the channel because I was embarrassed,\" he says. \"I feel embarrassed. I just changed the channel [so] Cristiano Jr. [wouldn't] see that they speak bad about his father about a very bad case.\n\n\"It makes me feel so bad, Piers, to be honest.\"\n\n\"Cristiano Ronaldo Meets Piers Morgan\" will air on ITV at 9 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\nRead more:\n\nAlex Morgan says 'there's too much evidence to cover up' the rape allegation against Cristiano Ronaldo\n\nCristiano Ronaldo gave an emotional interview where he said being accused of rape made 2018 the worst year of his life\n\nThe Cristiano Ronaldo rape allegations started with a chance meeting at a Las Vegas nightclub", "description": "In teaser clips for the hour-long interview, Morgan shows Ronaldo video of his late alcoholic father speaking proudly about his son's achievements.", "authors": ["Alison Millington"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7f5f1c2e22af12410389b3-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
