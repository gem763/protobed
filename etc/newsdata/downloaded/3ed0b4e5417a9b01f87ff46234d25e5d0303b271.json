The move was made citing a historical Parliamentary precedent, which finds asking Members of Parliament the same question again and again is an affront to their dignity because their first decision should be respected.\n\nYet this begs the question why politicians should be afforded this privilege and not members of the public. In a peculiar twist of fate, many MPs protected in this way are simultaneously campaigning tirelessly to force the British people to vote on Brexit for a second time \u2014 and maybe even a third \u2014 until they give the right answer and embrace the European Union.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa WATCH | The European Union doesn't take 'No' for an answer. Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, France and Greece have all had referenda ignored or overturned.

And by the same token, it is quite wrong to expect the voters to have to answer the same question a second time.\u201d\n\nHis remarks were met with jeers in the chamber.\n\nRe-running, changing the question of, or simply ignoring the outcomes of national votes that go against the desired direction of travel set by Brussels has become a regular feature of European Union-style democracy. Such reruns when Brussels got the wrong answer have been seen in Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, and possibly the United Kingdom in the near future.\n\nThe Associated Press wrote of the Speaker\u2019s move to prevent Parliament voting on the deal again:\n\nBercow says the vote sought by the government was \u201cin substance the same\u201d as one held on Saturday and it would be \u201crepetitive and disorderly\u201d to allow a new vote Monday. Johnson\u2019s Conservative government will now go to its Plan B: get Parliament\u2019s backing for the deal by passing the legislation necessary to implement it. The government plans to publish the bill later Monday and hopes to have it become law by Britain\u2019s scheduled Oct. 31 departure date. But it\u2019s unclear whether the bill can win majority backing in Parliament, and opposition lawmakers will try to seek amendments that could alter or scuttle it. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay urged lawmakers to back the bill and \u2014 more than three years after British voters narrowly voted to leave the EU \u2014 \u201cenable us to move onto the people\u2019s priorities like health, education and crime.\u201d\n\nRead more at Breitbart London", "description": "Anti-Brexit Members of Parliament are outraged the government wants them to vote more than once on Brexit after they gave the wrong answer the first time -- an ironic position given the determined push to have a second referendum on whether to leave the European Union, as one Brexiteer member pointed out Monday afternoon.", "authors": ["Oliver Jj Lane"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1132156512-e1571681322553-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
