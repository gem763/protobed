Although $1 million is the oft-cited amount needed to retire comfortably, it might not be enough. \"On average, a $1 million retirement nest egg will last 19 years,\" according to a 2019 report from personal finance site GOBankingRates. And depending on where you live, retirees could blow through $1 million in as little as a decade. Of course, everyone's individual situation is different. It's certainly possible to retire with $1 million in savings \u2014 and many Americans live on much less. While the amount you need is highly personal and depends on your lifestyle and spending habits, there are a few basic guidelines to follow if you want to retire comfortably.\n\nSet aside 10-15% of your income as soon as possible\n\nWork your way up to saving 10 times your salary\n\nAnother rule of thumb, from retirement-plan provider Fidelity Investments, is that you should have 10 times your final salary in savings by 67 to last you through retirement. \"Our savings factors are based on the assumption that a person saves 15% of their income annually beginning at age 25, invests more than 50% on average of their savings in stocks over their lifetime, retires at age 67, and plans to maintain their preretirement lifestyle in retirement,\" Fidelity says. Getting to 10 times your final salary \"may seem ambitious,\" the report adds, \"but you have many years to get there.\" Here's a timeline you could follow to see if you're on track to get there: By 30: Have the equivalent of your starting salary saved\n\nsaved By 35: Have two times your salary saved\n\nsaved By 40: Have three times your salary saved\n\nsaved By 45: Have four times your salary saved\n\nsaved By 50: Have six times your salary saved\n\nsaved By 55: Have seven times your salary saved\n\nsaved By 60: Have eight times your salary saved\n\nsaved By 67: Have 10 times your salary saved\n\nHow do I get on track?", "description": "According to TD Ameritrade's 2019 Retirement Pulse Survey, 58% of Americans think that $1 million in retirement savings will be enough.
