If you\u2019ve spent time researching how to \u201cimprove,\u201d \u201cchisel,\u201d or \u201cdefine\u201d your jawline, you may have stumbled across the product as an option that doesn\u2019t require fillers or implants. If you pay attention to the MMA community, you may have seen sponsored posts from Jose Torres or Ricky Glenn endorsing it. Or, maybe most likely, you might have discovered Jawzrsize through clips circulating the internet mocking it, because it\u2019s hilarious to watch someone use one. A Jawzrsize in action looks like a combination of a ball-gag and a pacifier, a combination that amounts to viral alchemy.\n\nWomen no longer have the market cornered when it comes to hating what they look like and feeling the societal pressure to throw money at their insecurities. Men are flocking to plastic surgeons, and a May 2019 New York Magazine feature chronicled the incel pilgrimage to one Dr. Barry Eppley, the reconstructive surgeon whose talents many men reportedly believe could gift them a better face and thus, a better life. But one of the features that\u2019s become a focal point of masculine insecurity is also one that can supposedly be altered with nonsurgical solutions by men who see room for facial improvement but lack the drive or the resources to go under the knife. For the dudes who despair over their jawline, Jawzrsize says: What's good.\n\nJawzrsize is a patent-pending silicon ball that users can chew on systematically in order to exercise their masseter muscle, which connects the lower jaw to the cheekbones and is most prominent below the ears, where the jaw meets the neck. The reasoning goes that an active masseter muscle is a thicker masseter muscle, and a thicker masseter muscle makes for a more defined, masculine jawline. The device comes in three different tiers, with three different levels: beginner (20 pounds of resistance), intermediate (30 pounds of resistance), and advanced (40 pounds of resistance). Each Jawzrsize is either a \u201cpop 'n' go\u201d model, which means it\u2019s ready for use upon arrival, or a \u201ccustom fit,\u201d which comes with two mouthpieces that you can boil and mold to fit your teeth. It also comes with a string, so you can wear your Jawzrsize around your neck and use it on the go, if the mood were to strike. Reviews of the device are often done by men chomping on the silicone ball as they also lift weights in the gym, doing face reps as they do body reps.\n\nDr. Jacob Steiger, a facial plastic surgeon who practices in Boca Raton, Florida, told VICE he gets asked about facial exercises on a daily basis. Although his clientele still skews female, he said that around one in five of the people he treats is male, and called men the \u201cgrowth segment\u201d of the last decade. \u201cCosmetic surgery\u2019s not just for the girls anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nSteiger is familiar with the masseter muscle because it\u2019s where he\u2019ll inject Botox or other neuromodulators in order to thin a patient\u2019s face into something more heart-shaped than square-jawed. Jawzrcise users, theoretically, are looking for the opposite effect. \u201cIn the medical literature, there really isn\u2019t any good data other than small, selective studies that would show any benefit to doing any kind of facial exercises or exercises with the jaw to thicken the masseter,\u201d he said. Steiger also expressed concern about the jaw stress that could stem from using a product that depends on chewing. \u201cJust like when you play a lot of tennis you can get tennis elbow, or if you run a lot you can have arthritis in your knees, I would have problems with a lot of chewing, or chewing with a lot of force, with this product,\u201d he said.\n\nAsHBoy, a 19-year-old YouTuber from Morocco who regularly takes on \u201cchallenges\u201d and films them, said he saw real aesthetic results from using Jawzrsize. AsHBoy posted his first Jawzrsize-oriented video, titled \u201cBEST EXERCICE TO TIGHTEN CHIN & JAWLINE!- 30 DAYS FACE TRANSFORMATION [sic],\u201d in February 2018. It has since garnered more than 2 million views. \u201cI thought that everything about it was fake, so I had to go ahead and try it out,\u201d AsHBoy told VICE. He reached out to Harris over email and the CEO sent him a Jawzrsize sample. \u201cI proposed the video and he loved it,\u201d AshBoy said. He didn\u2019t enter the testing process expecting results, but ended up seeing a significant difference anyway. \u201cMy jawline got better, it got stronger and it looked bigger than how it used to look back on day one,\u201d he said. He stopped using Jawzrsize after he stopped filming\u2014he said he was in it for the content, not for the facial improvement\u2014but would \u201cdefinitely recommend\u201d Jawzrsize to anyone looking for a \u201chotter, more manly\u201d profile.\n\nJawzrsize CEO Brandon Harris maintains the reason his product has survived the mockery it has received since his company completed a successful Kickstarter campaign in July 2016 is that it works. Harris claims he has a legion of satisfied customers ready to testify in favor of the product\u2019s unverified cosmetic and medical claims. The Jawzrsize website cites feedback from people who say Jawzrsize has helped them with \u201cTMJ disorder, smoking cessation, lock jaw, low bite strength, post-surgery muscle restoration, circulation, and blood flow.\u201d Harris thinks it\u2019s capable of even greater feats, even though he\u2019s not a doctor and he definitely\u2014as he was careful to emphasize multiple times\u2014isn\u2019t making any medical claims. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really done as much research as we would like,\u201d Harris told VICE. \u201cNone of this is medically proven or even scientifically proven\u2014this is just common sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rejuvenator,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe\u2019re actually creating beauty from the inside out on a person\u2019s face. This is action, a physical motion. This is the one cosmetic beauty tool that is going to change the world.\u201d\n\nOne of the more nebulous benefits of Jawzrsize that Harris discussed was the activation of the \u201cprimal bite,\u201d the innate human urge he said \u201csoft, processed\u201d modern food is unable to satisfy. (Scientists do theorize that jaw alignment in the Western world has been altered by the introduction of the knife and fork, and a diet rich in processed foods has been linked to weight gain, but the \u201cprimal bite\u201d itself seems to be Harris\u2019s own theory.) Jawzrsize is for you, he said, \u201cIf you have this primal bite somewhere inside you that\u2019s just yearning to get out, you\u2019re biting your nails, clenching your jaw, grinding your teeth when you\u2019re sleeping, you smoke cigarettes, you\u2019ve got oral fixations a mile long.\u201d This was the potential use that appealed to me most about the overflowing box of Jawzrsize samples Harris sent to the VICE office. The last thing I\u2019m looking for is facial bulk, but honestly, chewing on the beginner-level Jawzrsize felt amazing (to me! Other staffers kind of hated it. My editor worried out loud that Jawzrsize would give her \u201cbuck teeth\u201d).\n\nHarris said also believes, based solely on the anecdotal evidence of customer feedback, that Jawzrsize could be effective when it comes to dealing with sleep apnea, teeth grinding, \u201camnesia,\u201d and stimulating blood flow to the temporal lobe.\n\n\n\nPart of the reason Harris is such a fervent believer is that he developed the Jawzrsize with himself in mind. He\u2019s a former MMA fighter who suffered a series of devastating jaw injuries that he says he bounced back from completely, thanks to Jawzrsize. Before, his jaw was atrophied after months wired shut. Now, when he goes to the dentist, he said they pepper him with questions and compliments. \u201cThey cannot believe my TMJ [temporomandibular joint]\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel my face and they\u2019re like, This is the most healthy, aligned, smoothest TMJ I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Harris, skeptics abound. Chief among these doubters are plastic surgeons.\n\nDr. Steven Pearlman, a facial plastic surgeon who runs a private practice in Manhattan and takes before-and-after photos of his patients for posterity, criticized the deceptive visuals of the transformation photos that flash across the homepage of Jawzrsize\u2019s site. \u201cLooking at the photos on this website\u2014the first guy, he\u2019s moving his chin forward! He\u2019s putting his lower teeth in front of his upper teeth, behind his lips,\u201d he told VICE. \u201cThese are not quality pictures, you can barely see the face\u2019s anatomy.\u201d Pearlman said his practice has its own studio with preset lighting, fixed flash, and procedural guidelines to ensure the angle of the face is the same in all of the pictures his employees shoot and display. \u201cThere are ways to make a neck, jawline, eyes, all kinds of facial features look better if you just have the patient do certain facial movements or change the lighting,\u201d he said.\n\nBenjamyn Smith, a YouTuber, personal trainer, and movement coach who reviewed Jawzrsize, sought the product out for non-cosmetic reasons. He told VICE that he bought Jawzrsize after experiencing jaw discomfort and night grinding, which he concluded was caused by the headrest in the truck he drove for his primary job at a utility company (without the consultation of any kind of doctor). He picked up a Jawzrsize \u201cmasterpack,\u201d again without heading to a doctor or dentist, because he said he \u201cfelt that I had enough knowledge in this area to evaluate the cause of the issue and a reasonable solution, aka rehabilitative exercises,\u201d a move he said he doesn\u2019t recommend other people make. (We second that conclusion.) Within three months, Smith said his night grinding stopped and his jaw was back in line with his head and neck. \u201cFor me it was very beneficial, but I was also very aware of why I was using it and what I was doing it for,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019m not shaving my beard to evaluate whether it changed the way my jaw looks, especially considering that\u2019s not why I bought it in the first place.\u201d Smith has since stopped using Jawzrsize. He has also switched jobs, and said his jaw issues have not recurred.\n\nBoth Smith and AsHboy felt Jawzrsize was overpriced (a single piece is priced at $34.95, and a set of three is priced at $69.95), and warned against potential tooth damage from overuse. \u201cIt\u2019s like any other workout,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou can go lift weights in a way that\u2019s beneficial to you, but you can also lift weights in a way that you\u2019re gonna hurt yourself. This product is no different. You can\u2019t just grab it and start gnawing away on it and expect to get what you want out of it.\u201d\n\nHarris knows how his fervent belief may come off to critics. \u201cIt\u2019s also a little bit crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cI get it. But you think the first time Edison had a lightbulb people didn\u2019t think he was nuts? And now look at the world!\u201d\n\nPearlman, the plastic surgeon who was critical of Jawzrsize\u2019s advertising strategy, said he wouldn\u2019t try to dissuade a potential patient from using Jawzrsize if they were curious. \u201cThey can prove me wrong,\u201d Pearlman said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to dash anybody\u2019s hopes for a nonsurgical treatment. If I treat you now, or in a month from now or five years from now, it\u2019s not going to change the inevitable aging process.
