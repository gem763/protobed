She\u2019s back to releasing music with her new single \u201cGood Side\u201d and a promised 2020 album, and has plans for a second memoir. There can\u2019t be much she still wants to do, right? Wrong! At the New Yorker Festival on Saturday, where she talked about her new book and performed a hit-filled set with her band, Phair told the crowd about two lingering aspirations.\n\nOne: She wants to live in a period drama. \u201cI wanna have a corset on, to have tea and wonder what the men are doing. Like, I really, really do,\u201d she told New Yorker writer Ariel Levy. \u201cI\u2019m so scared I\u2019m gonna die and never have that.\u201d We can\u2019t let that happen! Is it too late to sneak Liz Phair onto this next season of The Crown? Wondering about men might seem out of place for the singer who made Exile in Guyville, but Phair has a theory. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because all the women were together in those movies, maybe because I was so longing to have female company in my profession,\u201d she added. \u201cBut it\u2019s stuck, it\u2019s like my comfort.\u201d And as rock royalty, Duchess Phair will only have the finest! \u201cI call them dress movies, they have very specific standards,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey\u2019re not rom-coms. They must have socio-political undertones. Men have to actually react as men would. And there has to be an unnecessarily long shot of a dinner table.\u201d Tragically, she\u2019s been saving the Downton Abbey movie for when she\u2019s back home in Chicago, so we\u2019ll have to wait for her review.\n\nTwo: She wants to help cows build their own villages. (Just, uh, try to follow here.) Later in the talk, an audience member asked Phair if she believed in a hierarchy of art forms. \u201cI have a field of things I love,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019m like Ferdinand the Bull, I\u2019m just sitting in the field.\u201d She went on, explaining that she doesn\u2019t understand how humans\u2019 opposable thumbs have made us significantly more developed than other creatures, and doubled down on with the cow motif. \u201cI don\u2019t even see human beings as particularly better than animals,\u201d Phair said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why like, cows haven\u2019t developed villages yet. \u2026 I\u2019m a little concerned about that.\u201d Very concerning for sure! One possible explanation? \u201cThey couldn\u2019t get it done, they couldn\u2019t get the zoning. They couldn\u2019t pass their plans in the zoning wars, I understand,\u201d Phair said. But if you are reading this and you are a cow, do not fret! She added, \u201cI\u2019m planning to help them with that.\u201d Well, you heard it here first! And whatever cause Liz Phair is backing, we\u2019re backing it too.\n\nWith such a busy schedule ahead, let\u2019s hope Phair gets some time to live out both her dreams. Although, probably not at the same time.", "description": "Promoting her new book Horror Stories at the New Yorker Festival, singer-songwriter Liz Phair talked about her love of period dramas and wondered why cows don\u2019t have their own society by now.", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/14/14-liz-phair.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
