No pinching, no scratching, no kicking, no biting,' Van Fossen can be heard saying to the girl as she tries to place the seat belt over her shoulder.\n\nFrancella Van Fossen, 78, is facing a charge of battery after a surveillance camera caught her slapping a 10-year-old girl across the face as she tried to buckle her into a seat on a school bus\n\nShortly after, the girl hits Van Fossen several times on the arm, before appearing to bite her.\n\nThe bus aide then quickly turns around and slaps the disabled girl across the face.\n\nThe other woman gasps in shock, before Van Fossen replies: 'I shouldn't have done that, I know, but she bit me!'\n\nThe pair continue to struggle to secure the girl into the bus before the camera cuts out.\n\nAccording to WTHR, Van Fossen had been transporting the girl to school for three years prior to the incident.\n\nIn court documents obtained by the news network, Van Fossen told investigators she \"touched\" the girl's face after she was bitten.\n\nShe is expected to plead guilty to the battery charge in court on Monday, the network says.\n\nNobelsville schools released a statement following the incident, saying: 'Student safety is our top priority and we have zero tolerance for behavior that puts our students at risk in any way.\n\n'We immediately addressed this issue in collaboration with Noblesville Police upon learning of this situation back in May. The bus aide in question is no longer employed with Noblesville Schools.'", "description": "Francella Van Fossen, 78, is now facing a charge of battery over the incident which occurred in Noblesville back in May", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/14/19590576-0-image-a-9_1570802090080.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
