Colt McCoy will start Sunday against the New England Patriots at FedEx Field.\n\nCoach Jay Gruden announced the move Friday, saying he made his choice \u201ca long time ago.\u201d McCoy replaces Case Keenum, who is questionable for Sunday\u2019s game with a foot injury, as starter and will play ahead of first-rounder Dwayne Haskins.\n\nThe Redskins had been waiting for McCoy to get healthy. After breaking his leg last December, the 33-year-old aggravated the injury in mid-August \u2014 sidelining him for a month and a half. McCoy returned to practice last week.\n\n\u201cAll three quarterbacks know the system, but Colt has the most experience in it,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cHe\u2019s very comfortable in it. \u2026 I think this will be a great test for him. He hasn\u2019t faced a live [pass] rush since Philadelphia last year. I think that\u2019ll be the biggest test for him.\u201d\n\nBefore his injury, McCoy made a strong impression in training camp. Gruden said Friday that the starting job was the quarterback\u2019s \u201cto lose\u201d and McCoy looked comfortable in running the offense.\n\nThe Redskins made a change at quarterback for a few reasons. The first, Washington is 0-4 and Keenum\u2019s play has spiraled over the last two weeks. After starting out the year with five touchdowns in two games with no interceptions, Keenum turned the ball over six times combined against the Chicago Bears and the New York Giants.\n\nGruden benched Keenum at New York, partially citing the 31-year-old\u2019s foot injury, which he suffered against the Bears.\n\nBut the Redskins are also turning to McCoy for his experience. The Texas product signed with Washington in 2014, the same year Gruden was hired. The two have been linked ever since, and Gruden has praised McCoy throughout their tenure.\n\n\u201cThis is his sixth year in the system,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cThese other guys just got here in the offseason. It means a lot, really. \u2026 He\u2019s been in all the meetings. He\u2019s confident in the system and now it\u2019s just a matter of going out and doing it.\u201d\n\nGruden drew criticism this week for saying he didn\u2019t \u201chave a plan\u201d at the position when on a conference call with reporters. The sixth-year coach has also received flack for his handling of Haskins, the team\u2019s 15th overall pick who threw three interceptions.\n\nGruden pushed back against both of those notions throughout the week, taking jabs at critics during his daily press conference.\n\nThe Redskins\u2018 coaching staff don\u2019t feel like Haskins is ready to play, though Gruden turned to him in the Giants\u2019 game in search of a spark with his team down 14 points in the second quarter. Haskins\u2018 performance, however, seemed to confirm Gruden\u2019s hesitancy as the 22-year-old threw three interceptions in the loss.\n\nGruden did not reveal if Haskins or Keenum will be the backup quarterback on Sunday.\n\n\u201cDwayne is working on a daily basis,\u201d offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell said. \u201cIt\u2019s just trying to go from the system he was running in college to running what we run now here and being ready to play against an NFL defense. There\u2019s a lot of things that are kind of out of his control that come into play, while also understanding where he\u2019s at in his long-term development process that\u2019s very, very important to us.\u201d\n\nThe Patriots will be McCoy\u2019s seventh start since 2014. He started two games last year after Alex Smith suffered a season-ending leg injury, but his chance was ruined when he broke his own leg on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nNow, McCoy will receive another opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe made a big deal about, \u2018I don\u2019t want him on the field until he feels like he\u2019s 100%,\u2019\u201d Gruden said. \u201cAnd he got some good throws in last week to get his feet wet. This week, he\u2019s had a good week.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
