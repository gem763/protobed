That is because the Sep 20, 2019 $22.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Revolve shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company?
