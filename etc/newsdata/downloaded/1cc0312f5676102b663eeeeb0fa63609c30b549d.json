This giraffe will be rehabilitated and return to the wild, as a number of others have done before him. Right now, giraffes are undergoing what has been referred to as a silent extinction. Current estimates are that giraffe populations across Africa have dropped 40 percent in three decades, plummeting from approximately 155,000 in the late 1980s to under 100,000 today. The decline is thought to be caused by to habitat loss and fragmentation and poaching, but because there haven't been long term conservation efforts in the past, it's hard to know exactly what is happening.

This is more than 18 times global electricity demand today.\u201d\n\nBut the agency says \u201cmuch work\u201d must be done to bring a clean energy revolution to fruition.\n\n\u201cOffshore wind currently provides just 0.3 per cent of global power generation, but its potential is vast,\u201d said Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA.\n\n\u201cMore and more of that potential is coming within reach, but much work remains to be done by governments and industry for it to become a mainstay of clean energy transitions.\u201d\n\nGrowing awareness of the climate crisis and political responses to environmental concerns are also contributing to growth in the sector, the report indicates.\n\nIn just 20 years, wind could become Europe\u2019s main source of energy generation.\n\nCurrent offshore wind capacity in the European Union stands at almost 20 gigawatts, and under current policies, that is set to rise to nearly 130 gigawatts by 2040.\n\nHowever, if EU countries meet their stated carbon-neutrality aims, offshore wind capacity would jump to around 180 gigawatts by 2040 and become Europe\u2019s largest single source of electricity, the IEA says.\n\nBut that could be boosted even further, the authors say. An even more ambitious vision \u2013 in which government policies drive an increase in demand for clean hydrogen produced by offshore wind \u2013 could push European offshore wind capacity \u201cdramatically higher\u201d.\n\nIn this scenario, electricity generated by wind turbines would be used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen atoms, with the hydrogen then being stored and ultimately blended with normal gas supplies to heat houses or fuel vehicles. It could also be recycled to generate more clean electricity.\n\nMeanwhile, China is set to take the lead from the UK as the nation producing the most energy from offshore wind.\n\n\u201cBy around 2025, China is likely to have the largest offshore wind fleet of any country, overtaking the United Kingdom,\u201d the IEA said. \u201cChina\u2019s offshore wind capacity is set to rise from 4 gigawatts today to 110 gigawatts by 2040. Policies designed to meet global sustainable energy goals could push that even higher to above 170 gigawatts.\u201d\n\nThe technology is particularly attractive in China, where major efforts are under way to reduce air pollution. Offshore wind farms can also be built near many of the country\u2019s major population centres.\n\nThe IEA said one of the most important technological advancements in offshore wind is the development of floating turbines that could be deployed further out at sea.\n\n\u201cIn theory, [floating turbines] could enable offshore wind to meet the entire electricity demand of several key electricity markets several times over, including Europe, the United States and Japan,\u201d the agency said.", "description": "Wind power\u00a0accounts for just 0.3 per cent of the world\u2019s energy \u2013\u00a0but as\u00a0costs fall and green\u00a0policies rise, it is on course to grow into a trillion-dollar industry.
