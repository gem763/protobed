I was nearly two weeks into establishing a dedicated routine in Ring Fit Adventure, the latest fitness experiment from Nintendo. But I was sick and just couldn\u2019t summon the energy to run on the spot for 10 minutes. The idea of doing squats or thigh presses made me feel weak. But as I laid in bed chugging cough syrup, I also realized just how much the game had changed my mindset in such a short period. I went from never working out to feeling guilty about taking a weekend off.\n\nRing Fit Adventure is a game that builds off of one of Nintendo\u2019s biggest hits. Back in the glory days of the original Wii, Wii Fit sold millions of users on the idea of working out in front of their televisions. But despite coming from Nintendo, it wasn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d call a video game. It was more of a lightly playful fitness aid. Ring Fit Adventure, meanwhile, is most definitely a game \u2014 and not just any game, but a full-fledged RPG, complete with worlds to explore, monsters to battle, and items to collect. By combining the two, Nintendo has created something I thought was impossible: a way to exercise regularly that I actually enjoy.\n\nSo what exactly is Ring Fit Adventure? It\u2019s a combination of a game and peripherals. In terms of hardware, you get two main pieces: a leg strap and a large resistance ring. Each of these connects to a Joy-Con controller to measure and track your movement. They\u2019re both quality add-ons that stood up to what I could give them over the last two weeks. I had some occasional issues with the leg strap coming loose, but it\u2019s easy enough to tighten, even in the middle of doing some lunges. Similarly, the ring \u2014 which Nintendo calls a Ring-Con \u2014 is a sturdy accessory. You have to be really hard on it during certain exercises, pulling and squeezing it as much as you can, and it held up to everything I gave it.\n\nThe setup for the game is appropriately ridiculous. You play as a silent hero in a fantastical realm that is under threat from a roided-up dragon in spandex. Like many games, you travel across a large map, going from level to level, accomplishing various goals. There are towns and shops, enemies and gear. You can even gather ingredients to create magical potions, which, naturally, are called smoothies in the game. It\u2019ll all be very familiar if you\u2019ve ever played an adventure or role-playing game before.\n\nIt\u2019s very familiar if you\u2019ve ever played an adventure or role-playing game before\n\nBut things are very different once you actually start playing. One of the first things you do in Ring Fit Adventure is meet a sentient ring named\u2026 Ring. It serves as a combination of sidekick and personal trainer, helping you through the game with a steady stream of tips and encouragement. Here\u2019s how a level works: with the leg strap tightened and the Ring-Con held in front of you like a steering wheel, you move through the level by jogging on the spot. As you do this, you\u2019ll regularly come up against obstacles that require different movements to get past. To jump, you point the Ring-Con down and squeeze; to go up stairs, you raise your knees higher while jogging. You can collect coins on the side of the trail by stretching out the Ring-Con and sucking them up, and you can destroy obstacles like boxes by squeezing the ring, letting out a powerful burst of air.\n\nIt might not sound that hard, but it can be tricky, especially as you have to remember all of the various inputs in quick succession, without taking a break from running. Naturally, more interactions are added as you progress. Eventually, you\u2019ll be doing squats to jump higher on trampolines and twisting your body to paddle a boat. Levels can last anywhere from two to 10 minutes, and I regularly found myself sweating after doing two or three.\n\nThen there are the battles. In addition to running through each stage, you also have to fight bad guys. The enemies are adorable versions of gym gear; a trundling kettlebell with an attitude or a sweet yoga mat with doe eyes. Battles are turn-based, as if you were playing Final Fantasy in a gym. In order to attack, you select from a number of different exercises. You then do reps \u2014 that could mean squats, a warrior pose, or planking \u2014 which will inflict damage on your enemies. When it\u2019s their turn to fight back, you hold the ring against your abs and squeeze, holding it for the duration of the attack to create a shield. This process repeats until one of you runs out of health.\n\nThere\u2019s a layer of strategy added in to force you to try different exercises. Most enemies have a color, and exercises are similarly grouped into colors. Leg-related exercises are blue, for instance, while yoga poses are green. So if you come up against a blue kettlebell, you\u2019ll probably want to do some thigh crunches. This becomes particularly important against bosses, which have huge health bars. If you aren\u2019t being strategic about your attacks, you\u2019re going to have a hard time. The more you play, the more exercises you\u2019ll unlock so that you\u2019re not stuck doing the same yoga pose every time you encounter an angry green exercise ball.\n\nThe game is easy to fit into your life\n\nWhat\u2019s perhaps most surprising is that both halves of Ring Fit Adventure not only work well together, but they feel fully developed on their own. I really enjoyed the lighthearted RPG gameplay and particularly the world, which is a charming, pun-filled place, despite initially looking very generic. Somehow, despite it yelling at me constantly, I never got tired of Ring and its very helpful positive reinforcement. At the same time, whenever I play, I really feel like I\u2019m getting a workout in. It was a struggle at first, but I could feel myself becoming more adept with each passing day. I could do more, and I felt better afterward. (In a nice touch, the game will ask you each day if you want to increase the challenge or keep it the same, allowing you to ramp things up at your own pace. Though this also means you aren\u2019t forced to test your limits; you have to choose to.)\n\nAlso important: the game is easy to fit into your life. Because each level is just a few minutes long, you can get in a quick workout on a busy day, but you can also string together a few if you\u2019re looking for something more intense. The game will even warn you if it thinks it\u2019s time to take a break. Ring Fit Adventure also supports multiple accounts, so you can have several people in the same household using it, and it will track their efforts and customize the experience to their needs. There are also mini-games (more on those tomorrow) and customizable exercise playlists for those who don\u2019t see the appeal of digging through a multi-hour RPG.\n\nThe best part about the game, though, is that it is just plain fun. I\u2019m a little bit dubious about how accurate it is in terms of tracking my calories and heart rate, but I don\u2019t think the specifics matter all that much, at least for me. Instead, the most important thing is how it changed the way I think about exercise. It\u2019s no longer a chore. By making the experience into something I\u2019m intimately familiar with \u2014 namely, a nerdy RPG \u2014 Ring Fit Adventure gave me a structure that made sense and that I enjoyed. The result is that once I started playing, I didn\u2019t want to stop. I\u2019ve missed three out of the last 14 days, and I feel guilty even about that. That\u2019s pretty decent progress for someone who generally avoids the gym.\n\nNow that\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t issues. As I said, I\u2019m not really not sold on how accurate everything is; after each workout, the game tracks your heart rate via the Joy-Con\u2019s IR sensor, and it never seemed to accurately represent the way I felt. I would get relaxed readings when I could barely catch my breath and told I had an intense workout when I breezed through a level. Similarly, there are some elements of the RPG experience that don\u2019t jibe so well with exercise. Having to grind through experience levels by replaying levels or going through optional side quests, in particular, feels very tedious the few times it\u2019s forced on you in the game, and those long, exhausting boss battles are incredibly frustrating when you die. I also had a few issues with certain exercises not recognizing my movements, which is a common flaw in motion control games, but it feels extra annoying when you don\u2019t get credit for hard physical work.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you that Ring Fit Adventure is a proper substitute for going to the gym or a way to really get in shape. What I can say is this: it\u2019s a polished, fun game that feels like a real workout, and, for me, it became a way I could almost seamlessly fit physical activity into my life. Even as I sit here typing this, I\u2019m feeling a bit off about only having put in 20 minutes today. The good thing is that squeezing in another 20 is pretty simple.
