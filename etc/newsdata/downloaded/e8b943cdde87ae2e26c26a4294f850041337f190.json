September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 4/11 8. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Gennady Golovkin (38-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. Getty Images 6/11 6. Errol Spence (25-0-0) After his impressive win over Garcia in which he didn't drop a round, Spence added another big name to his record. Shawn Porter will be next, to unify the belts and perhaps further close the gap between himself and rival Terence Crawford in the P4P standings. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight, but injury has delayed his debut against Carlos Takam. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\n\u201cYou remember during the first press conference [for the Khan fight]? I was wearing sunglasses. Do you think I was wearing them to look cool? It was because the lights were bothering me and my mind was so mentally f****d up and confused that I don\u2019t remember anything from that training camp.\n\n\u201cI got a concussion in the summer [2017]. But I didn\u2019t know it when I was fighting in Niagara Falls [in June against Gurrola]. The symptoms got lost for a year because I didn\u2019t know how to treat it, I was like, \u2018what\u2019s going on with my mind? I feel so confused and so f****d up. What\u2019s going on with me?\u2019\u201d\n\nLo Greco was expected to easily knock out Gurrola when they met in Canada, but the fight lasted the eight-round distance and left him tired and drained.\n\nDespite failing to shake the symptoms, he recognised the reward on offer against Khan and hoped the issue would pass. The attraction of subsequent paydays should he have beaten the high-profile British fighter, alongside Khan\u2019s vulnerability after a near two-year lay-off following a knockout loss to Canelo Alvarez in 2016, made the fight appear more appealing.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t get to the bottom of it so I went to the hospital and saw the doctor in October or November of that year [2017],\u201d Lo Greco adds. \u201cHe told me, \u2018You have a concussion, you have to treat this\u2019. Then I go ahead and taunt Amir Khan, not thinking I would get the fight. But I get the fight and I\u2019m like, \u2018f*** I spoke so much, what am I going to do, back out? People will think I\u2019m a big mouth\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo when I was there, at the press conference, my mind was spinning, I was just praying to god during the training camp I would heal. I don\u2019t remember nothing, absolutely zero.\n\n\u201cWhen they (the photographers) took the pictures I thought, \u2018f***, they caught my eye\u2019, but luckily nobody made a big fuss. Can you imagine the conditions I went into the fight that night? How dangerous and critical and dumb was it of myself to do that.\u201d\n\nLo Greco\u2019s revelation comes after Anthony Joshua\u2019s trainer Rob McCracken admitted he \u201cknew\u201d the former world heavyweight champion was concussed in the third round of his knockout loss to Andy Ruiz Jr in June. The Team GB coach later denied any wrongdoing, insisting \u201cit may be that concussed is not the right term to have used\u201d.\n\nBut Lo Greco suspects some trainers may overlook warning signs depending on what is at stake.\n\n\u201cIt depends on the type of fight that it was,\u201d Lo Greco explains. \u201cFor me it was a winnable fight [vs Khan], I took a shot to take the fight.\u201d", "description": "Phil Lo Greco admits he was \u2018lucky not to end up in a coma\u2019 after fighting Amir Khan while carrying the effects of a long-term concussion.
