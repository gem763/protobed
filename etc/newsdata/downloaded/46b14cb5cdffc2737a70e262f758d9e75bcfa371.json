Yet a second successive 4-0 defeat in a heavy Euro 2020 qualifier now makes it four defeats in five for Steve Clarke and while the Nations League play-offs in March won\u2019t throw up another Belgium or Russia, Scots hopes of a return to a major finals now look as distant as ever.\n\nFor 57 minutes Clarke\u2019s makeshift side just about held it together.\n\nRussia's forward Artem Dzyuba celebrates after scoring the first goal of the match on Thursday\n\nDzyuba broke the deadlock in the 57th minute and Scotland then fell apart in the second half\n\nMATCH FACTS Russia: Guilherme, Fernandes, Semenov, Dzhikija, Kudryashov, Ozdoyev, Barinov, Zhirkov, Ionov, Dzyuba, Golovin. Subs: Dzanaev, Petrov, Chistyakov, Lunev, Ignatiev, Kuzyaev, Bakaev, Cheryshev, Komlichenko, Belyaev, Karavaev, Akhmetov. Scotland: Marshall, Palmer, Mulgrew, Devlin, Robertson, Fleck, McGregor, McGinn, Snodgrass, Burke, Fraser. Subs: Russell, MacGillivray, Shankland, Forrest, Christie, O'Donnell, McLaughlin, Taylor, Armstrong, Gallagher, Findlay.\n\nThe loss of another mundane goal from a corner saw the roof cave in around their heads, the World Cup quarter-finalists running in another three goals in the final half hour.\n\nIn those torrid final minutes the best hope of salvation lay in an abandonment caused by the sudden emergence of a Tokyo style typhoon. No such luck. For Scotland\u2019s national football team the night ended in another perfect storm. Mercifully, the Russians stopped short of matching their 60 point thrashing at the rugby. Just.\n\nFour defeats in their last five qualifiers saw Scotland enter this game with an air of pensive, gloomy resignation. To escape serious damage the game required Clarke to display the organisation nous which landed the job in the first place. And it needed a tight, compact formation concentrating to within an inch of their lives. Against the odds they pretty much managed it for 57 minutes. Alas, they couldn\u2019t do it for 90\n\nAberdeen\u2019s Mikey Devlin made his Scotland debut a fortnight after starting a 5-0 defeat to Rangers at Ibrox and losing his place for the next game. At 34 Charlie Mulgrew is playing for Wigan in England\u2019s League One. Liam Palmer replaced Stephen O\u2019Donnell at right-back despite a nightmare debut in a 3-0 defeat to Kazakhstan. If the plan was to use Andrew Robertson\u2019s Champions League medal might as a shield of steel to repel Russia it didn\u2019t work.\n\nDepressingly a meat and drink corner kick was Scotland\u2019s undoing once again. For almost an hour a two lines of dark blue frustrated and defied the home nation. The goal which broke the defiance but brilliantly taken by the menacing Artem Dzyuba, but ridiculously easy.\n\nA corner kick from Aleksandr Golovin picked out the captain, losing Mulgrew a little too easily. Pluncking the ball from mid-air with his left foot the number 22 volleyed a controlled strike into the top corner to provoke an outpouring of joy in the Luhniki Stadium.\n\nDzyuba celebrates adding a third for his side to pile pressure on Scotland boss Steve Clarke\n\nIronically, the breakthrough came as Scotland were enjoying their best spell in the match. Lawrench Shankland, the Dundee United striker, was called from the bench at half-time for Oli Burke and the Scots were passing the ball better than at any time in the match.\n\nYet the pre-match foreboding was well placed in the end. Three minutes after the opening goal Russia doubled their lead, an outstanding 25 yard strike from Magomed Ozdoev fizzing into the top corner. Russia now found themselves a point away from automatic qualification. After some dogged resistence Scotland were back to square one. Backs to the wall trying to keep the score down. Dzyuba\u2019s second and Russia\u2019s third came wit 20 minutes to play, owing much to more poor defending.\n\nIt was always likely to be a long night, Steve Clarke making big calls in every department. The goal threat of James Forrest was benched for the second game in succession in favour of left sided Ryan Fraser playing on the right flank. At 34 Robert Snodgrass switched from right to left as 28-year-old John Fleck of Sheffield United finally made his full international debut.\n\nOli Burke, one of just five players in the squad to have scored in six qualifying games, was given the nod up front, with midfielder John McGinn surprisingly occupying an advanced role in a 4-4-1-1 formation ahead of Celtic\u2019s Ryan Christie. Playing as a striker Burke scored a last winner against Cyprus in Clarke\u2019s only win in five matches. The experiment really didn\u2019t work here, the West Brom hauled off at half-time in a quest to get further up the pitch.\n\nRussia's Magomed Ozdoyev (C kneeling) celebrates after scoring the second for his side\n\nThe Scots made it to half-time undamaged despite a damaging lack of composure in possession. Snodgrass couldn\u2019t lift the ball off the ground when he was twice presented with the chance to send Ryan Fraser in on goal after 28 minutes and it rather summed things up. From promising opportunities to break in the first half the Scots managed to lose possession time and again, Burke a persistent offender. The former West Brom winger turned centre forward has ability, but never seems entirely sure what to do with it. A terrific athlete, he would take a touch, find a promising pocket of space then pass the ball straight to a Russian.\n\nAnd yet. Scotland could be happy with a first half when It took 39 minutes for David Marshall to make an actual save.\n\nIn a 2-1 win in Glasgow Monaco\u2019s Aleksandr Golovin tore Scotland to shreds. He almost did it again before the interval, some neat Russian passing crafting a rare shaft of light for a shot on goal. Marshall managed to push the ball wide clear of danger.\n\nThe last passing move of a goalless first half came from the Scots. As the whistle shrilled in the Moscow sky the rain had finally stopped and things were looking up.\n\nTaking a heavy fall in the first half Burke failed to appear for the second. The appearance of a third debutant in Lawrence Shankland, a Championship striker with Dundee United, raised eyebrows. Not least, you suspect, from Johnny Russell \u2013 a player whose willingness to travel from MLS to sit on the substitute bench remains a modern marvel.\n\nAleksandr Golovin, second right, celebrates with team-mates after scoring his side's fourth\n\nYet the change had an instant impact. Shankland\u2019s first contributions in a Scotland shirt did something Burke failed to do. Keep the ball.\n\nScotland were growing in confidence, retaining possession, playing well, when the sky caved in. Yet again the damage was done from poor defending at a set-piece. The second goal was outstanding, David Marshall powerless to stop Ozdoev\u2019s stunning strike.\n\nFrom nowhere Scotland were two goals down, struggling to cling to respectability. It proved too much in the end.\n\nDzyuba smashed an ambitious curling shot against the crossbar. With 20 minutes to play things grew ominous, the towering captain Dzyuba scoring the easiest goal he\u2019ll ever score.\n\nReplacing Ryan Fraser Celtic\u2019s Ryan Christie gave Russian keeper Marinato his first save of the night with a drilled left foot strike. The game was 74 minutes old.\n\nAs they did in Glasgow the Russian duo of Dzyuba and Golovin destroyed Scotland in the end. The captain unselfishly passed on the chance of a deserved hat-trick to give his teammate the goal he deserved with six minutes to play. For Scotland the final whistle couldn\u2019t come quickly enough.", "description": "STEPHEN MCGOWAN IN MOSCOW: Routed at rugby Russian revenge came on the football pitch and proved swift, clinical and brutal.
