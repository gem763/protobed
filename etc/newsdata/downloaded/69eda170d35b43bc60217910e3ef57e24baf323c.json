Lines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America's fundamental freedoms,\" the NRA said in a release.\n\nWalmart won praise from gun control advocates for its statement Tuesday announcing a decision to curb sales of some guns and ammunition, as well as to discourage open carrying of weapons in store by shoppers.\n\nWalmart's announcement comes just days after a mass shooting claimed seven lives in Odessa, Texas, and follows two other back-to-back shootings last month, one of them at a Walmart store.\n\nOn Aug. 3, a gunman entered a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, and killed 22 people with a type of firearm that the retailer already bans the sale of. It was the deadliest shooting in Walmart's history. A second unrelated shooting that same day in Dayton, Ohio, killed nine people.\n\n\"It is shameful to see <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Walmart?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Walmart</a> succumb to the pressure of the anti-gun elites.

The company stopped selling handguns in the mid-1990s in every state except Alaska. The latest move marks its complete exit from that business and allows it to focus on hunting rifles and related ammunition only.\n\nSupporters of stricter gun laws say that as the nation's largest retailer, Walmart will have an outsized influence on the gun debate, sending a strong message to Congress as well as other corporations to take action.\n\n\"Walmart deserves enormous credit for joining the strong and growing majority of Americans who know that we have too many guns in our country and they are too easy to get,\" said Igor Volsky, executive director and founder of Guns Down America, in a statement.", "description": "The National Rifle Association has lashed out at Walmart, criticizing the retail giant for discontinuing sales of some gun ammunition products and requesting that customers no longer openly carry firearms in its stores.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5270318.1567620147!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/earns-walmart.jpg"}
