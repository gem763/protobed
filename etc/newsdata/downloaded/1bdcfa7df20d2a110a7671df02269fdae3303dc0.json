She became the first woman from Iraq to win the Nobel Peace Prize for her activism in speaking out against abuse and sexual violence\n\n'It's the US under President Truman, under President Roosevelt that said \"no we have to have trials because there must be a judicial record of the atrocities committed by the Nazis\",' Clooney continued in the CBS network interview.\n\n'Because today you do have people denying that there were gas chambers and what do you have to point to? You can go back and say there are 4,000 documents that were submitted in the Nuremberg trials and the Yazadis deserve nothing less than that.'\n\nMurad appeared on the 60 Minutes 2014 season Premiere after she was found by Associate Producer Rachael Morehouse a few weeks before, living among Yazidi refugees who had escaped ISIS.\n\nThousands of Yazidi men were massacred and more than 3,000 women and girls as young as nine were enslaved. She only agreed to speak to Pelley with her face covered out of fear of retribution against her family members she believed were still held by ISIS but had in fact been killed.\n\nIn Sunday's interview Clooney explained: 'You had mass graves that weren't secured and Yazidis knew their relatives were buried and nobody was exhuming them.\n\n'I noticed witnesses were more and more reluctant to speak out as time went by. There's only so much you can do as a small team of lawyers and we said this is the responsibility of the UN. And it's the responsibility of the most powerful body within the UN, which is the Security Council.'\n\nClooney on Tuesday addressed a panel discussion at the UN about press freedom around the world\n\nFive years ago, Morehouse held her hand as she spoke about the genocide of her people and the women who were taken and sold into sexual slavery.\n\nShe then asked the UN to hold ISIS accountable.\n\nIn the new interview she speaks with her face uncovered.\n\n'At the beginning, rape was a big shame for me and for others to speak about,' she told Pelley. 'Because it would have remained as a shame on you, on your family and on your people. The biggest incentive that made me talk was those left behind including my mother and sisters. I knew what was happening to those in the captivity of ISIS.'\n\nMurad joined an activist group in Germany, it took her to the UN, where she became a Human Rights Ambassador and then wrote a book and now the UN recognizes the genocide that happened to the Yazidis, but Clooney is helping with the steps required to secure a trial.\n\n'I saw it as a test of the international system. It was so egregious because it involved ISIS and involved a clear case of genocide. It involved sexual slavery at a scale that we haven't seen in modern times,' says Clooney. 'I thought if the UN can't act in this case then what does the international rule of law even mean?'\n\nIn the new program, 60 Minutes goes back to Sinjar with Murad days after she received the Nobel and where she put a replica of the medal next to the mass grave that contained her mother's remains.\n\n'I wonder if [mother] knows that I have talked to the world about her silent death, the killing of her six sons and her two nieces,' Murad says in the program. 'I often feel that what I have been doing is because of her. I wish that she would know about it she may be happy because the world now knows what ISIS has done.'\n\nNobel Peace Prize winning human rights activist Nadia Murad shared her harrowing story of escape from the clutches of ISIS with Donald Trump in the White House, but things quickly took an awkward turn when the seemingly confused \u2013 or disinterested - president asked her where her family was, despite having just been told twice that they\u2019d been murdered by the Islamic State\n\nPresident Trump was seemingly unaware of her effort to stop the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, judging by their July meeting in the White House.\n\nMurad was awkwardly forced to explain to President Trump why she had been internationally recognized as things quickly took an awkward turn when the president asked her where her family was - despite having just been told twice that they'd been murdered by the Islamic State.\n\nDuring her moving monologue, Murad stood beside a seated Trump urging him to help her Yazidi community return home to Iraq by intervening in the conflict between Iraqi and Kurdish forces fighting over the land left behind in ISIS' collapse.\n\n'Now there's no ISIS, but we cannot go back [home] because the Kurdish government and the Iraqi government, they are fighting each other [over] who will control my area,' Murad told the president. 'They killed my mom, my six brothers.'\n\nPlight of the Yazidi under ISIS The Yazidis are a religious sect whose beliefs combine elements of several ancient Middle Eastern religions. The group's beliefs were seen as heretical by the twisted butchers of the Islamic State. ISIS overran the Yazidi faith's heartland of Sinjar in northern Iraq in 2014. Men and older women were massacred, while younger women and girls were forced into sex slavery or 'married' to ISIS fighters. Thousands of Yazidi women were raped and tortured by their captors. The attacks by ISIS on the Yazidis were condemned as genocide by the United Nations. As ISIS's grip on Iraq was lost earlier this year, the jihadis decapitated dozens of Yazidi women and dumped the heads in dustbins, according to British SAS troops who entered recaptured territory.\n\nCutting her off mid-sentence, Trump interjects, asking, 'Where are they now?'\n\nTaken aback by the question, Murad blinks and pauses for a moment, before clarifying, 'They killed them. They are in the mass graves in Sinjar and I'm fighting just to live. Please do something.'\n\nTrump, who has boasted of crushing the self-styled caliphate of the Islamic State group that once stretched across Iraq and Syria, appeared at a loss when Murad asked him to press the Iraqi and Kurdish governments to create safe conditions for the Yazidis to return.\n\n'But ISIS is gone and now it's Kurdish and who?' Trump asked, before later telling her, 'I know the area you're talking about very well.'\n\nTrump told her he was going to look into the Kurdish and Iraqi conflict 'very strongly', before questioning her on her Nobel Prize win.\n\n'So they gave you the Nobel Prize? That's incredible,' He told her. 'They gave it to you for what reason?'\n\nA bemused Murad responds, 'For what reason? After all that has happened to me, I didn't give up. I make it clear to everyone that ISIS raped thousands of Yazidi women.'\n\nThe teaser for Murad and Clooney's 60 Minutes appearance came a day after George Clooney said he was appalled that Trump partly justified the decision to withdraw US troops from Syria by stating Kurds 'didn't help us with Normandy' during the Second World War.\n\nThe politically active Hollywood actor, director and producer told a business seminar in Finland's capital that he found Mr Trump's words from a day earlier 'a pretty shocking statement'.\n\nClooney accused Washington of leaving the allies of US forces in Syria to deal alone with Turkey's military offensive.\n\n'I'm horrified at the idea we would say that after having Kurds fight our battle for us \u2014 because we don't want to send troops there \u2014 and then say, 'OK, you're on your own',' he said.\n\nClooney was interviewed at the Nordic Business Forum in Helsinki in front of some 7,000-strong audience of mostly business and corporate leaders.\n\nHe is known to voice opinions on global political matters and has been engaged in humanitarian causes together with his wife Amal Clooney.", "description": "Amal Clooney has called on ISIS to see the inside of a courtroom once and for all as she appears with last year's Nobel Peace Prize winner in a 60 Minutes interview where she compared the world's reaction to crimes against Yazidis to that of 'after the atrocities of Nazi Germany'.", "authors": ["Leah Simpson For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/22/19608752-0-image-a-42_1570829018065.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
