Christ, imagine that.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why the US is obsessed with Australian artists when we\u2019re putting out continuous golden hazy jams like this, really.\n\n\ufeff\n\nAfter rounding out their first-ever European tour \u2013 which had them selling out the O2 in London \u2013 Lime Cordiale quickly ducking over to the US to play a couple of shows at the end of September in LA and New York.\n\nThen they\u2019re coming home to kick off a huge run around Australia and New Zealand, as well as hitting up some of the essential summer fests like Lost Paradise, Spilt Milk, and Festival Of The Sun. Simply no rest for the wicked.\n\nPeep all of their upcoming Aussie & NZ tour dates below if you wanna catch Lime Cordiale before they really bloody take off, which if Post Malone has his way, the world is now their fuckin\u2019 oyster.\n\nThey\u2019ve had to upgrade a few shows and announce some new gigs, which has them essentially doing residencies at The Triffid in Brisbane and The Corner Hotel in Melbourne. So cop a ticket over on their website.\n\nHoly hell mates, this is such a huge \u2013 and delightfully weird \u2013 get.
