It\u2019s not a piece of equipment you\u2019d usually expect to find in an artist\u2019s supply cupboard. Yet for Garry Turler, it\u2019s his tool of choice.\n\nProfessional chainsaw carver Garry, discovered his talent for wood carving quite by chance.\n\nHe made the brave decision to give up the day job to follow his passion, and now goes to work every day with a smile on his face.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if people notice me being happier doing what I do now but I\u2019ve certainly noticed a difference in myself,\u201d said Garry.\n\n\u201cLeaving school I didn\u2019t really know what I wanted to do. I followed the sort of work that my father did in engineering. I did an apprenticeship with a local firm.\n\n\u201cI left there, went to work with my father in my thirties but I was getting quite fed up with it; it just got repetitive and boring for me. My head wasn\u2019t in that type of work.", "description": "The chainsaw.
