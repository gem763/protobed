If one category doesn\u2019t hit its limit, it's not clear that those slots will be transferred to another category.\n\nThe Trump administration would devote 5,000 spaces to people with a fear of religious persecution, 4,000 spaces to Iraqis who aided U.S. forces in that country and 1,500 spaces to people from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, according to a proposal shared with lawmakers and obtained by POLITICO. Only 7,500 slots have been set aside for a general pool of refugees from around the world. Congolese and Burmese refugees \u2014 who made up more than half of the 30,000 refugees accepted last year \u2014 will compete with people of other nationalities for the limited spaces in that general pool.\n\nThe U.S. won\u2019t likely move fast enough to reach the caps this year for certain refugees, such as Iraqis, who have had trouble getting through the refugee system under enhanced Trump-era security hurdles and vetting.\n\nAn analysis of State Department data by resettlement groups in July found more than 100,000 Iraqis are seeking to enter the U.S. as refugees. Of those, roughly 14,700 had completed a prescreening process and 2,100 had finished interviews with USCIS officers, according to a State Department report reviewed by POLITICO in July.\n\nBut even with the long line, the delays caused by the security measures make it unlikely the U.S. will admit the 4,000 allowed under this year\u2019s cap. Complicating matters, security checks for some of those would-be refugees could expire while they wait to be resettled, Smyers said.\n\nThe U.S. admitted 9,880 Iraqi refugees in fiscal year 2016, but let in only 140 Iraqi refugees in fiscal year 2018 and 465 last year.\n\n\u201cProcessing in general has been significantly delayed, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re not seeing a large number of Iraqis that are coming in through this program,\u201d said Jenny Yang, vice president of policy and advocacy with World Relief, another resettlement group.\n\nThe slowdown in processing is happening as the Trump administration pursues policies shutting down the avenues for new refugees to get into the pipeline.\n\nUSCIS officers who interview prospective refugees overseas have seen their workload slashed in recent months \u2014 with no new trips planned through the end of the calendar year. The number of USCIS officers assigned to interview refugees \u2014 a vital step in the process \u2014 fell to 35 in July, down from 110, according to an agency official. The majority of those staffers, who were previously spread across nine countries, were reassigned to conduct interviews with domestic asylum seekers from the agency\u2019s office in Washington, the official said.\n\n\u201cBy definition, they have no infrastructure on the ground.\u201d - Administration official\n\nUSCIS is expected to reevaluate its refugee interview schedule once the president finalizes the fiscal year 2020 ceiling. The agency reviews refugee trips every three months during the year.\n\nAt the same time, the administration is planning to reduce the role of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which previously referred the majority of refugees to the U.S. The U.S. will no longer accept referrals from the international organization except related to the categories outlined in the new proposal. And even though the U.S. will continue to work with the United Nations to process refugees in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, UNHCR doesn\u2019t have personnel on the ground yet who can process enough cases to reach the 1,500-person cap for those countries.\n\nThe U.S. granted refugee status last year to 311 Salvadorans, 118 Guatemalans and 74 Hondurans \u2014 just 503 people in total.\n\n\u201cBy definition, they have no infrastructure on the ground,\u201d one administration official said of UNHCR\u2019s current capability. \u201cThey haven\u2019t put people in the field yet to do these things.\u201d\n\nA UNHCR spokesperson said generally that resettlement \u201cremains a vital durable solution for some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people,\u201d but added that it\u2019s \u201cdisappointing that there are more refugees in need of resettlement than there are places made available by governments.\u201d The spokesperson declined to comment on Trump\u2019s refugee plan specifically.\n\nRefugee backers say they also fear that the Trump administration will limit Central American refugee admissions by setting tougher standards. Under federal law, both refugees and asylum seekers must demonstrate that they cannot return to their home countries \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d\n\nTrump officials repeatedly have said that Central American families trekking to the U.S. are driven primarily by economic need and don\u2019t have valid asylum claims. If the federal officials approach refugee claims made outside the U.S. in the same way, it could limit the number of successful applications from Central America.\n\nMorning Shift Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

The provision, introduced in 1990 by the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), created an easier standard for Jewish and Christian minorities in former Soviet states to obtain refugee status.\n\nThe program in recent years has served mostly as a vehicle for Ukrainian evangelical Christians. In fiscal year 2019, the U.S. admitted 4,451 Ukrainian refugees, the second-largest nationality behind Congo.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the religious minority community that is most in need,\u201d said one resettlement group staffer.\n\nThe Lautenberg program also has covered Iranian religious minorities since 2004, but few have been resettled under Trump. Iranian refugees are subject to the same new security measures facing Iraqis. Only 199 Iranian refugees were admitted overall last year.\n\n\u201cI think with political will a lot can be done,\u201d said Melanie Nezer, senior vice president for public affairs at HIAS, a resettlement agency formerly known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. \u201cBut there\u2019s really been no indication from this administration that there\u2019s political will to rescue and resettle refugees.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Administration Official"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/72/8c/eb6fd587498094504f9afde7e20f/191010-welcome-refugees-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
