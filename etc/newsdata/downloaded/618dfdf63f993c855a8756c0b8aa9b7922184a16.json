Eamon Gallagher\n\n\"We\u2019ve seen a step change lower in global bond yields that has driven a very significant re-rating of the value of royalty assets. This value uplift has not yet translated into a stronger Iluka share price, which is why we believe a demerger of its MAC royalty makes so much sense.\n\n\"There are absolutely no synergies between the mineral sands division and the MAC royalty and the assets appeal to a different set of investors. Ultimately, Iluka shares are trading way below fair value, because the royalty is currently hidden within Iluka\u2019s corporate structure.\n\n\"We are confident that other shareholders would see the commercial logic in a demerger of the MAC royalty and we have provided a very thorough explanation of the logic for the demerger in our latest quarterly report.\"\n\nIt comes as Iluka is set to front fund managers at an investor briefing on October 31.", "description": "Mineral sands miner Iluka Resources is under pressure to spin off a valuable iron ore royalty in a move that could unlock about $2 billion in value for shareholders.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6051%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_46%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8d0e66945510881a526f659da3c457ecbf3e4627", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
