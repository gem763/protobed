Katie Hill as she faces allegations of sexual improprieties.\n\nPapadopoulos tweeted this week his intention to win back the seat for the Republican Party: \u201cI\u2019m smelling blood in the water now that Katie Hill has resigned. California\u2019s 25th congressional district is wide open for the taking. Someone has to step up. I love my state too much to see it run down by candidates like Hill. All talk, no action, and a bunch of sell outs.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHe joins several Republicans already lining up to vie for the seat, including Mike Garcia, a Marine who has been endorsed by former Gov. Pete Wilson. Other Republicans include Lancaster City Councilwoman Angela Underwood-Jacobs, former Buck McKeon aide Suzette Martinez Valladares, Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2018s Sgt. Mark Cripe and Santa Clarita resident Charlies Patron.\n\nAssemblywoman Christy Smith of Santa Clarita, the first major Democrat to jump into the race, reacted to the Papadopoulos announcement in a tweet Tuesday: \u201cWow! @GeorgePapa19 is running in #CA25! If he pled guilty to lying to the FBI - how do we know he'll tell us the truth? We deserve someone from our community serving as our voice - not @realDonaldTrump 's wannabe political hack! #CA25 belongs to #CA25.\u2019\u2019\n\nSmith, in an appearance on CNN, portrayed herself Tuesday as the key ally and successor to Hill.\n\n\u201cI know Katie, she\u2019s a good friend, we fought the good fight,\u2019\u2019 Smith said.\n\nAppearing to seize the mantle of Hill, who hasn\u2019t yet endorsed anyone in the race, Smith added: \u201cShe\u2019s handing this over to me now because the issues we fought for in this country are so important.\u2019\u2019", "description": "He joins several Republicans already lining up to vie for the seat.", "authors": ["Carla Marinucci"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/0e/1c/9581d4f84736810edfa5a3915818/ap-19053852138776-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
