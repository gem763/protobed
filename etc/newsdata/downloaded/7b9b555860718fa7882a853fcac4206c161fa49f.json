REUTERS/Albert Gea\n\nMuch is at stake, both for Spain and for its wealthiest region in this trial over a failed independence bid that attracted worldwide attention, triggered Spain\u2019s biggest political crisis in decades and unnerved financial markets.\n\nSecessionist groups have called for massive but peaceful civil disobedience if the 12 - nine of them have been in pre-trial detention for close to two years - are not acquitted.\n\nIt is still unclear how much support such protests may get and whether the promise of peaceful demonstrations holds.\n\nThe court plans to convict the most prominent leaders on charges of sedition and misuse of public funds but none would be found guilty of the more severe charge of rebellion, a judicial source told Reuters on Saturday.\n\nA court spokesman did not comment on this and other media leaks on the verdict.\n\nSentences are expected to be announced at the same time.\n\nThe maximum prison term would be 15 years for one of the defendants, the source said. The prosecutor had sought a maximum sentence of 25 years.\n\nThe sentences would be lower for the other eight jailed leaders, the source said.\n\nThe remaining three who were tried - three politicians who are currently out of prison - would be found guilty of disobedience, which does not carry a prison sentence, the source said.\n\nThe source said that it could not entirely be excluded that the court would delay the publication of its ruling to Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nSeparatist parties have said the only acceptable verdict for them would be the acquittal of all 12 politicians.\n\nThe region\u2019s separatist leader Quim Torra said on Wednesday that a guilty ruling would be a \u201ctorpedo\u201d to Catalan society.\n\nCatalan separatist protests have been largely peaceful but police sources have said authorities are prepared for potential violence.\n\nThe government has said it is ready to take direct control of Catalonia - as in 2017 - if secessionist leaders break the law.\n\nThe ruling is set to impact the run-up to Spain\u2019s fourth national election in four years, scheduled for Nov. 10, and will also determine the separatist movement\u2019s direction.\n\nA poll in July showed 48.3% of Catalans against secession and 44% in favour.", "description": "Spain's Supreme Court is expected to announce on Monday its highly-anticipated verdict in the trial of 12 Catalan separatist leaders over their role in the region's 2017 banned referendum and short-lived independence declaration.", "authors": ["Joan Faus", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440504699&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0PS", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
