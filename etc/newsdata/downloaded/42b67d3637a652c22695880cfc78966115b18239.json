Drugmaker Teva Pharmaceuticals would pay $20 million in cash and $25 million in opioid addiction treatment drugs.\n\nSummit County will receive 38% of the settlements and Cuyahoga County 62%, according to a news release from Summit County Executive Ilene Shapiro.\n\n\u201cWhen we filed this lawsuit nearly two years ago, we did so on behalf of every family who couldn\u2019t do it for themselves and on behalf of all the communities who feel this epidemic every day,\u201d Ms. Shapiro said. \u201cOur goal was, and still is, to bring about behavior change on the part of the opioid makers and distributors and the pharmacies who fueled this crisis in our community.\u201d\n\nWalgreens is now the only defendant left in the trial that had been scheduled to start Monday. A new plan is for Walgreens and other pharmacies to go to trial within six months if settlements are not reached, according to The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cThe impact of the opioid crisis on our communities has been devastating. Locally, we know the pain of losing fathers, mothers, children, neighbors and friends,\u201d Cuyahoga County Executive Armond Budish, County Council President Dan Brady and County Prosecutor Michael O\u2019Malley said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhile we cannot return loved ones who succumbed to this scourge to their families and communities, we can and we must treat and save those thousands in our county who remain addicted and prevent the next person and family from experiencing the horrors of addiction,\u201d they said.\n\nThe lawsuits allege that drugmakers unlawfully marketed prescription opioids to health care professionals while downplaying their risks. They also allege that drug distributors failed to report suspicious orders of opioids to authorities.\n\nThe three distributors said they \u201cstrongly dispute the allegations\u201d made by the two Ohio counties, but they believe settling the trial can help achieve a \u201cglobal resolution\u201d and deliver meaningful relief.\n\n\u201cThe distributors remain deeply concerned about the impact the opioid epidemic is having on families and communities across the nation \u2014 and are committed to being part of the solution,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nThe settlement averts a trial but does not address the more than 2,600 lawsuits nationwide that aim to pin blame on the drug industry for fueling the opioid epidemic.\n\nAttorneys general from four states and industry CEOs reportedly did not agree Friday on a deal possibly worth $48 billion in cash and drugs that would settle cases across the country. There were disagreements over how to allocate the settlement.\n\nThe four attorneys general involved in discussions over the nationwide cases \u2014 Ken Paxton of Texas, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Josh Stein of North Carolina and Herbert Slatery of Tennessee \u2014 called Monday\u2019s settlement an \u201cimportant step that allows us to move forward to finalize the global settlement framework.\u201d\n\nLast month, OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma reached a more than $10 billion deal with 24 state attorneys general and officials from five U.S. territories to address the opioid crisis. The company also had filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\nIn August, an Oklahoma judge found Johnson & Johnson and its Belgian subsidiary, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, guilty of helping to create an addiction crisis and ordered the drug maker to pay $572 million in the first state trial over the opioid epidemic.\n\n\u2022 This article is based on part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
