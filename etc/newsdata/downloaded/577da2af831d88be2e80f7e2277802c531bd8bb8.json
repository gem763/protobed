This has contributed to calls from politicians such as Hillary Clinton for expanded background checks, along with an end to the \u201cCharleston loophole,\u201d which allows for thousands of guns \u2013 55,887 between 1998 and 2014 \u2013 to be sold to people with criminal records and mental illness, such as Dylan Roof.\n\nHow does that happen? Individuals attempting to purchase a gun through a licensed dealer \u2013 rather than at a private show or unlicensed online \u2013 are subject to a criminal background check conducted by the FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). In spite of its name, however, the system does not always return an instant verdict on whether the purchaser can buy the firearm. Since 1998, according to data from the FBI, federal and state governments have run 202 million background checks on prospective gun owners. Nine percent of these checks delay the sale. If three business days pass without a verdict from the FBI, licensed dealers can sell the gun anyway \u2013 a provision known as a \u201cdefault proceed.\u201d\n\nScroll through the interactive below to see how the background check loophole has put an average of 3,490 guns in the wrong hands every year since 1998.\n\nThe ATF said it could not provide information on how many of these weapons were recovered.\n\nATF spokeswoman Dannette Seward said that \u201cso far, there\u2019s been no uniform method by which agents are entering firearm retrievals into a database, so we have no meaningful way to pull that data.\u201d\n\nIt was this three-day NICS loophole that allowed Dylan Roof to legally purchase the gun he used to kill nine churchgoers during a Bible study in Charleston, S.C. on June 17, 2015. Roof\u2019s background check returned a recent arrest in Columbia, S.C., delaying the transaction. An FBI examiner contacted the Lexington County Sheriff\u2019s Office, who told her to check with Columbia Police. The examiner couldn\u2019t find a Columbia police department in Lexington County, not knowing a small part of the city of Columbia \u2013 where Roof was arrested \u2013 lies in neighboring Columbia County. Meanwhile, three days passed, allowing Roof to return and purchase the gun as a default proceed. \u201cWe are all sick this happened,\u201d FBI Director James Comey said, \u201cwe wish we could turn back time. From this vantage point, everything seems obvious.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cdefault proceed\u201d loophole was made possible by a last minute amendment added to the 1993 Brady Act by Congressman George Gekas, a Republican from Pennsylvania. The FBI has since suggested that more time be allotted to investigate delayed transactions, but the law remains unchanged. In response to questions about how NICS accommodates the three-day delay, FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer wrote in an email that \u201cthe FBI continues the ongoing hiring initiative to increase the staff for the NICS section.\u201d\n\nFollowing the shooting in South Carolina, Democratic Congressmen James Clyburn introduced the Background Check Completion Act, proposing the elimination of the three-day loophole. And Hillary Clinton went a step further Monday, discussing the possibility of exercising executive action to close the loophole if elected president.\n\nWhile there has been no change at the federal level, several states and the District of Columbia have extended the three-day rule. In Tennessee, for instance, examiners are given 15 calendar days to examine the buyer\u2019s background before a \u201cdefault proceed.\u201d\n\nSome vendors have gone even further to close this loophole. Two years after a 2000 FBI report found that delayed background checks are 20 times more likely to be denied, Walmart refused to sell any firearm without a completed background check. But few other chains have adopted a \u201cdon\u2019t know, don\u2019t sell\u201d policy.\n\nImage: Getty Images (3)", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://timeinclabs.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/guns.jpg?quality=75&strip=color"}
