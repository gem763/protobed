Several others, including investigations into Kazakh mining group Eurasian Natural Resources Corp Ltd. and GPT Special Project Management Ltd., a subsidiary of aerospace company Airbus SE, are ongoing but have been under investigation for over six years.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe SFO\u2019s caseload has remained relatively consistent in recent years\u2014hovering around 70 to 75 cases, according to the last three fiscal-year reports.\n\nBut the majority of the agency\u2019s cases are complex, and can involve terabytes of data, which have to be analyzed and dealt with in accordance with the U.K.\u2019s legal privilege and due process rules, HMCPSI noted on Tuesday.\n\nThe review focused on specific case-management practices that HMCPSI found contributed to delays. The SFO has clear case-management processes, but they were at times inconsistently applied, HMCPSI found.\n\n\u201cThe report is clear that, while the SFO is effective at what it does, there are further actions we can take to improve case progression,\u201d Ms. Osofsky said in a statement.\n\nAfter deciding to accept a case, the SFO often took too long to define its parameters or allocate resources to the investigation, HMCPSI said.\n\nA case considered low priority could languish with the agency\u2019s intelligence division, which assesses tips of fraud and corruption and conducts research before a full investigation is launched, according to the inspector.\n\nIn some instances, the cases failed to advance for as many as 18 months, HMCPSI said. The inspector said SFO staff reported a lack of clarity into why some cases appeared to be given significantly more priority than others.\n\nAnother chokepoint was the SFO\u2019s digital forensic unit, which processes materials from searches, seizures or voluntary surrender, according to Tuesday\u2019s report. The unit has suffered from high staff turnover, according to HMCPSI. Seizure from one large case in particular had put a strain on the unit from which it had yet to recover, the inspector said.\n\n\u201cResourcing inevitably plays a part in this,\u201d HMCPSI said, referring to the staffing and evidence processing issues. It said the SFO needed to develop a strategic approach to resourcing and case management.\n\nHMCPSI on Tuesday said its report should not be read negatively. \u201cThere have been some failures but generally the SFO performs well and has delivered good results in many challenging cases,\u201d the inspector said.\n\nWrite to Dylan Tokar at dylan.tokar@wsj.com", "description": "The U.K.\u2019s Serious Fraud Office at times has struggled to appropriately staff cases and process digital materials, an independent government inspector said.", "authors": ["Dylan Tokar"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-115516/social", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
