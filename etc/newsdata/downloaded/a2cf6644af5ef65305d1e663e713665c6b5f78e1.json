Another man allegedly told the FBI he distributed speeches by a now-deceased terrorist, and a third allegedly admitted he engaged in militant acts in Somalia but he contended the admissions were coerced through interrogation.\n\nJudge Fisher wrote that the court examined the government's full explanations and concluded that \"an unclassified summary of the undisclosed reasons was not possible.\"\n\nEach plaintiff had \"fair notice\" that their alleged conduct, such as traveling abroad for weapons training with organizations linked to terrorism, \"would raise suspicion\" under the published standards, Fisher said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: San Francisco Chronicle, http://www.sfgate.com", "description": "The largely secret criteria for the government's no-fly list have been upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a case involving four people who sued over being barred from flying.
