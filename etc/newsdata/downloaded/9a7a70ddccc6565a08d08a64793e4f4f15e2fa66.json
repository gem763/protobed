The politician spends the money on TV ads and consultants and you hope it works out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to trust ourselves more than our politicians.\u201d\n\nImmediately after the announcement, Yang\u2019s campaign tweeted a video of the candidate talking about the plan in a sweepstakes-like fashion and asking viewers to go to his campaign website and enter for the raffle.\n\n\u201cIf you win, you\u2019ll get the money, and you\u2019ll get a whole lot of social media followers,\u201d he said in the video while laughing.\n\nThe gambit is designed to spotlight the cornerstone of his campaign: the universal basic income proposal. Yang\u2019s \u201cFreedom Dividend\u201d plan would give $1,000 a month to every U.S. citizen 18 and older as a way to deal with what he says is an economy disrupted by evolving technology and automation.\n\nAccording to Politico, Yang\u2019s campaign would pay out the money to the 10 families for the full year even if he does not become the Democratic nominee. Yang is already making a monthly $1,000 donation from his own personal finances to a family in New Hampshire, a family in Iowa and a family in Florida, all key states in presidential campaigns.\n\nOne potential problem for Yang: The online raffle\u2019s legality is being questioned. Time magazine reported that some experts say handing out campaign funds for families to use for personal reasons may violate federal election law.\n\nYang\u2019s announcement of his unusual plan prompted laughter from some of the nine other candidates on the debate stage, including Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kamala Harris of California and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s original, I\u2019ll give you that,\u201d Buttigieg said of the plan.\n\nReddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian of Initialized Capital, who has previously shown support for Yang, rallied to his side on Twitter after the candidate announced the idea. Responding on Twitter to questions about the plan\u2019s legality, he said he likes it \u201cso much I\u2019ll do it personally for those 10 people if you can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur nation needs to start exploring ways to adapt to the massive automation shift that\u2019s already happening,\u201d Ohanian said.\n\nHey @AndrewYang I like this idea so much I'll do it personally for those 10 people if you can't.\n\n\n\nWe talk about the future of AI often at @Initialized -- our nation needs to start exploring ways to adapt to the massive automation shift that's already happening. https://t.co/Q952shkWfs \u2014 Alexis Ohanian Sr. \ud83d\ude80 (@alexisohanian) September 13, 2019\n\nThis story has been updated with Ohanian\u2019s tweet.
