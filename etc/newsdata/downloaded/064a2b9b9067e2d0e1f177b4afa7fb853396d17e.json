REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nThe IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) fell to 45.0 from 45.3 in July, confounding expectations for an improved reading of 45.9 in a Reuters poll of economists.\n\nOverall, the survey is likely to add to questions over Britain\u2019s ability to bounce back from an economic contraction in the second quarter, a hangover from the stockpiling boom in advance of the original March Brexit deadline.\n\nAnother contraction in the current quarter would officially herald a recession.\n\nThe growing signs of a wilting economy \u2014 similar to elsewhere in Europe \u2014 raise the stakes for Prime Minister Boris Johnson in his standoff with Brussels.\n\nThe PMI\u2019s new orders index fell to its lowest level since March 2009, when Britain was deep in its last recession.\n\n\u201cDomestic political uncertainty continued to hold back the UK construction sector in August, with survey respondents indicating that delays to spending decisions had contributed to the sharpest fall in new work for over 10 years,\u201d IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said.Business expectations across the construction industry as a whole, which accounts for around 6% of economic output, fell to their lowest level since December 2008.\n\nBrexit doubts hit the commercial construction sector hardest, IHS Markit said.\n\nInvestors will be watching Wednesday\u2019s PMI for the much larger services sector to see if the weak readings from the manufacturing and construction surveys are reflective of the whole economy.\n\nBritish manufacturing contracted last month at the fastest rate in seven years, IHS Markit said on Monday.", "description": "British construction companies suffered the sharpest drop in new orders since the depths of the financial crisis last month as the Brexit crisis scared away potential customers, a survey showed on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425689124&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF820LV"}
