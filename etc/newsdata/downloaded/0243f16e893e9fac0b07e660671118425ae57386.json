But a Whitehall source could give the Mirror no timeframe for a response.\n\n(Image: Ian Forsyth)\n\nAnd a source told the Mail on Sunday any reform had been \"kicked into the long grass\" until after the next election \"and probably much later than that\".\n\nThe newspaper reported Ms Truss is concerned children must be \"protected\" from making decisions about their future before the \"implications are fully understood\".\n\nBut Shadow Women and Equalities Secretary Dawn Butler said: \"Boris Johnson's government have failed to publish the consultation results and are deliberately creating a hostile environment for transgender people.\n\n\"We must put a stop to this irresponsible behaviour. Almost half of trans people in Britain have attempted suicide at least once and 84% have thought about it.\"\n\nLGBT charity Stonewall's director of campaigns, policy and research Laura Russell added: \"Reform needs to be an urgent priority so trans people can be recognised for who they are.\n\n\"Any further delay will allow more fear and misinformation to spread and trans people have suffered far too long from inequalities that can be easily removed.\"\n\nShe added: \"Currently trans people must go through a lengthy and demeaning process to have their gender legally recognised.\n\n\"It's not just distressing, it's complex, costly and inaccessible to many trans people.\n\n\"Replacing this process with a system of self-determination would be life-changing for many trans people and a crucial step towards ensuring the UK's gender recognition laws are in line with international best practice.\"\n\nLGBT campaigners have called for the current system to be replaced with a simpler statutory declaration and self-identification.\n\nThey say transgender people currently face a two-tier system, as the gender on the majority of documents, including passports, do not require a change to a birth certificate.\n\nAccess to single-sex services such as hospital wards are covered under the Equality Act 2010, which says a transgender person's gender identity should be taken into account when using segregated services, rather than their sex on their birth certificate.\n\nThe current process is also said to cause problems with marriage and death certificates and does not allow for the legal recognition of non-binary people.\n\nA source said Ms Truss was still new in her brief and wanted to consider the \"incredibly high\" number of responses to the consultation. The source strongly denied the reforms had been scrapped.\n\nA Government Equalities Office (GEO) spokesperson said: \"The Secretary of State has only recently taken on this brief and will be carefully considering all responses and the next steps. These will be announced in due course.\n\n\"It is vital that the next steps on any potential reform of the Gender Recognition Act are carefully planned, and have the right backing so they can have a positive impact on the trans community in the UK.\n\n\"We had more than 100,000 responses to our consultation and have met with 140 organisations to ensure that we have taken into account views and concerns from all sides of the debate.\"", "description": "Tory ministers are accused of creating a 'hostile environment' for trans people as they remain waiting for vital reforms - almost a year after a consultation closed", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Barcroft Media", "Ian Forsyth"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10759657.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Pride-In-London-2017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
