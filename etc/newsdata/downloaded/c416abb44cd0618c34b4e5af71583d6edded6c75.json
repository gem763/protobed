The earnings report comes at a critical time for Tesla as it prepares to begin production of the Model 3 at its new China factory.\n\nThis earnings report, its first without co-founder and CTO JB Straubel on the job, is particularly important because it could be the first time the company experiences a year-over-year decline in quarterly revenue growth.\n\nThere are some important matters \u2014 namely numbers \u2014 to watch for in the automaker\u2019s actual earnings report. Before getting into which indicators to pay attention to, here\u2019s a quick recap of what happened in the last quarter.\n\nTesla reported wider-than-expected loss of $408 million, or $2.31 per share, and generated $6.3 billion in revenue in the second quarter despite record deliveries of its electric vehicles. The company delivered 95,200 of its electric vehicles in the second quarter, a dramatic reversal from a disappointing first period. Those numbers were later adjusted to 95,356 vehicles. The record-breaking figures in the second quarter stood in stark contrast to the company\u2019s first-quarter delivery numbers when it reported deliveries of 63,000 vehicles, nearly a one-third drop from the previous period.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nAnalysts are expecting a loss of 46 cents per share and revenue of $6.42 billion, according to data compiled by FactSet. If analysts are correct, revenue would be down from $6.82 billion a year ago.\n\nWe already know that Tesla fell short of its third-quarter delivery goals. Tesla CEO Elon Musk wanted, and pushed for, deliveries to hit 100,000 vehicles for the quarter. Instead, Tesla reported earlier this month that it delivered a record 97,000 electric vehicles in the third quarter, a nearly 2% increase from the previous period, but still short of analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nTesla produced 96,155 vehicles in the third quarter, a 10% increase from the previous period.\n\nExpect Tesla to provide updates on its China factory and give forecasts for the fourth quarter. The earnings call with analysts, which begins at 3:30 pm PT, will likely provide plenty of other headlines. Musk has a tendency to drop all kinds of news in these calls.\n\nAmong the items we\u2019ll be watching for is any discussion on Autopilot and its \u201cFSD\u201d (full self-driving) program, the company\u2019s energy business, production plans for the Model Y, status of the Tesla Semi and other often teased future models such as the Roadster and the yet-to-be-unveiled pickup truck.\n\nAnalysts will likely be hunting for any information on automotive gross margins. In the past, Tesla has said it is targeting 25% automotive gross margins for Model S, Model X and Model 3. That didn\u2019t happen in the first or second quarter. Instead, automotive gross margins, excluding certain items, shrank to 20.3% from 24.7% in the fourth quarter of 2018. They narrowed even further to 18.9% in the second quarter.\n\nTesla\u2019s margins were buffeted in the past by sales of the higher-priced (and better margin per vehicle) Model S and X. Now Tesla is in an awkward spot where demand for the Model 3 hasn\u2019t been enough to stave off contracting margins caused by a decline in Model S and X sales. Model 3s have a lower profit margin per vehicle than the S or X.", "description": "Tesla is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings after the market closes today.
