Some Palestinian activists condemned the Saudis\u2019 appearance for \u201cnormalizing\u201d the status quo as part of a subtle recent thawing of relations between the Arab power and Israel.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the governing Palestinian Authority hailed the game as a boost for sovereignty over local turf, if only the turf of a soccer pitch.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the Saudi team here to play for the first time on our own soil,\u201d said Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas after the players had stepped off their bus from the Jordanian border for a welcome that would include a state dinner and a visit to the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.\n\nIn 2015, during the last lead-up to the World Cup, the United Arab Emirates became the first team willing to come play in the modern, 12,500-seat stadium next to the concrete security wall dividing Israeli and Palestinian territory. But the Saudis, considered then as now the dominate football power in the region, refused an invitation to follow suit.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia is in a different league, just a massive brand in the Arab world,\u201d said Uri Levy, an Jerusalem-based football journalist who was the first to report on the Saudis\u2019 change of heart for this round. \u201cThis decision will have huge consequences.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nInterest in the game is sky high among West Bank fans. Thousands of free tickets were distributed in hours by the local phone company, Jawal.\n\n\u201cPeople are thrilled the Saudis are here,\u201d said Hamad Tomaleh, who was wearing a Palestinian national jersey and handing out tickets in the Ramallah Mall. \u201cFootball is like religion here.\u201d\n\nBut it is the political gamesmanship that has generated controversy. The Israeli government hasn\u2019t commented on the Saudi-Palestinian match, but Israel has historically welcomed such ordinary interactions with its Arab neighbors.\n\nFurther, the country is widely seen as waging an unacknowledged effort to ease tensions with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States, mostly over their shared concerns about Iran. The Israeli Foreign Ministry declined to comment for this article.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA number of Palestinian activists and militant groups denounced both the Palestinian Authority for inviting the Saudis and the Saudis for accepting. Some, pointing out that Israel won\u2019t even allow other Palestinian teams from the Gaza Strip to travel to the West Bank stadium, launched an online campaign against the Saudi appearance under the banner, \u201cNormalization is treason.\u201d\n\nKhalil Shaheen, a political analyst at the Palestinian center for Policy Research and Strategic Studies in Ramallah said Abbas and the Palestinian leadership were too eager to host an important game.\n\n\u201cHe is achieving the Israeli goal without knowing it,\u201d Shaheen said. \u201cThis is what gives Israel an excuse to say things are normal here.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSaudi and Palestinian officials rejected the criticism.\n\n\u201cJust by visiting the prisoners at the jail doesn\u2019t mean that you are supporting the jailers,\u201d Jibril Rajoub, the fiery head of the Palestinian Football Federation, said in an interview after a dinner with the Saudi delegation in the West Bank town of Rawabi. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the Palestinian people and it\u2019s good for the Palestinian cause.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Palestinians launched a major effort to lure the Saudi team. Rajoub, a high-ranking member of Abbas\u2019 Fatah party who refers to himself as \u201can ex-freedom fighter who spent 17 years in Israeli jails,\u201d said he was on the phone with an invitation to his counterpart in Riyad as soon as the World Cup group draw was announced. Abbas followed up with a personal appeal, according to the Saudis.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe president of the Palestinian government sent a letter to our king,\u201d said Yasser Al-Mishal, president of the Saudi Football Federation, who was at the dinner with Rajoub.\n\nAfter multiple meetings with both Jordanian and Palestinian officials, the Saudis decided to reverse their longstanding position.\n\n\u201cIt is a simple right for every national team in the world to host their own games in their own stadium,\u201d Al-Mishal said. \u201cWe thought that coming would also give a message to everyone that Palestine has its own territory and its own rights and we support that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe declined to address the political element, other than say he was unaware of any approval needed from higher up in Saudi government.\n\n\u201cFrom my end it\u2019s a purely sports event,\u201d he said.\n\nAD", "description": "The Green Falcons will face the Palestinian national team Tuesday.
