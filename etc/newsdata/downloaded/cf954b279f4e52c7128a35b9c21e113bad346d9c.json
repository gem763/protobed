The problem is, when you\u2019re speaking to foreign leaders, you don\u2019t want foreign leaders to feel that they shouldn\u2019t be speaking openly and good. \u2026 You want them to be able to express themselves without knowing that not every single word is going to be going out and going out all over the world.\u201d\n\nNews reports say that Trump pressured officials in Ukraine to undertake an investigation that would damage former Vice President Joe Biden, his potential Democratic opponent in 2020. A whistleblower complaint said to involve the president\u2019s actions is now the focus of a battle over congressional review.\n\nThose seeking an investigation want to know whether Trump, in a July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, made U.S. aid contingent on the country\u2019s looking into Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who had business dealings there.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the details of Trump\u2019s call shouldn\u2019t be made public.\n\n\u201cThose are private conversations between world leaders,\u201d Pompeo said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would leave whether that should be released\u201d to the White House, he added.\n\nMnuchin went a step further.\n\n\u201cI think it would be highly inappropriate to release a transcript of a call between two world leaders,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nCongress would be overreaching should it request to see such a transcript, Mnuchin continued.\n\n\u201cWhat I have a problem with is Congress asking for a transcript between world leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that those are confidential discussions, and that\u2019s a difficult precedent.\u201d\n\nBoth Cabinet members said they weren\u2019t on the call with Zelensky.\n\nTheir comments come as the White House tries to deflect blowback from the allegations of Ukrainian collusion by redirecting the conversation to claims that Biden, when he was vice president, threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid from Ukraine while demanding the firing of a prosecutor who was investigating the gas company where Hunter Biden held a board position.\n\nIn Iowa on Saturday, Joe Biden shot back at Trump .\n\n\u201cYou should be asking him the question: Why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader?\u201d Biden told reporters. \u201cThis appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power.\u201d\n\nThe president criticized those remarks on Sunday in Houston.\n\n\u201cVice President Biden did a terrible thing, the way he put it,\u201d Trump told reporters, adding: \u201cI\u2019m not looking to hurt him with respect to his son.\u201d\n\nRishika Dugyala contributed to this report.", "description": "News reports say US president pressured officials in Ukraine to undertake an investigation that would damage former Vice President Joe Biden, his potential Democratic opponent in 2020.", "authors": ["Eleanor Mueller"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1175948297-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
