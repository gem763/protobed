The financing could start to more formally come together as early as next week, but it may take longer for its structure and terms to be finalized, said the people, who requested anonymity because the talks are private.\n\nSoftBank Group Corp., the largest shareholder in WeWork, is currently in advanced talks to acquire more shares at a significantly lower valuation than the $47 billion WeWork had in January, said two people familiar with those discussions. SoftBank had already agreed to contribute another $1.5 billion to the company next April, according to WeWork\u2019s now-withdrawn prospectus for an initial public offering.\n\nThe financing talks sent the company\u2019s bonds to their biggest gain on record. WeWork needs new financing before the end of November to avoid running out of money, two people familiar with the matter said earlier.\n\nWe Co. was one of the year\u2019s most hotly anticipated IPOs, but a turbulent process turned into a cautionary tale of private market exuberance and cost the company\u2019s top executive his job. The fast-growing, money-losing startup had been counting on a stock listing -- and a $6 billion loan contingent on a successful IPO -- to meet its cash needs.\n\nThe company\u2019s bond prices climbed from record lows amid reports of the financing talks. Its senior unsecured notes due 2025 jumped more than 8 cents on the dollar to 90.50 cents at 2:34 p.m. in New York, after dropping to as low as 81.25 cents on Thursday, according to Trace bond trading data.\n\nThe terms and structure of the debt package are still fluid, the people said. Any high yield bonds offered as part of the package would likely be priced at a premium to the yield commanded by WeWork\u2019s outstanding bonds, which were issued with a 7.875% coupon and currently offer a yield of around 10%, some of the people said.\n\nSpokeswomen for JPMorgan and WeWork declined to comment.\n\nThe company\u2019s new co-chief executive officers have been moving to slash costs and spin off businesses in the past two weeks in an effort to slow its cash bleed. Analysts had previously estimated that the company would run out of money by the middle of next year.\n\nWeWork\u2019s bonds, which traded above par less than a month ago, plunged into distressed levels during the past month, dropping more than 20 cents on the dollar before Thursday amid mounting concerns about the company\u2019s cash situation. Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings have cut WeWork\u2019s credit grade further into junk on liquidity issues.\n\n(Updates with bond sale option and SoftBank funding talks starting in the second paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Katherine Doherty, Ellen Huet, Pavel Alpeyev and Nikolaj Gammeltoft.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Gillian Tan in New York at gtan129@bloomberg.net;Michelle F.
