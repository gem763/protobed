However, we need to continue to be very vigilant because they certainly want to regroup and bring back their reign of terror, but I'm very, very grateful,' said Diane Foley to CNN.\n\nRelief: Diane Foley said that while she had wanted al-Baghdadi to be arrested and brought to justice, she was grateful that he was dead\n\nJames Foley's mother continued that she prays 'captured ISIS fighters will be brought to trial & held accountable'.

'You mow it, but it continues to grow. And I don't think that the elimination of al-Baghdadi is the final answer.'\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed by an American Delta Force raid in the north of Syria, four miles from the Turkish border on Sunday following a five year hunt.\n\nOn Sunday, following the announcement of the raid, Diane Foley tweeted in a statement via the James Foley Foundation page: 'I am grateful to our President and brave troops for finding ISIS leader al-Baghdadi. I hope this will hinder the resurgence of terror groups and pray that captured ISIS fighters will be brought to trial and held accountable.'\n\nThe statement continued: 'I remain concerned about the dozen Americans held hostage in Syria, including Austin Tice and Majd Kamalmaz.'\n\nThe president touted the operation and al-Baghdadi's death as 'bigger than bin Laden.'\n\nOsama bin Laden, founder of Al-Qaeda and the terrorist leader behind the September 11 terrorist attacks, was killed in 2011 during a Navy SEALs operation during Barack Obama's presidency.\n\n'This is the biggest there is. This is the worst ever. Osama bin Laden was big, but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center. This is a man who built a whole, as he would like to call it, a country,' Trump said, referencing al-Baghdadi's creation of the Islamic State.\n\nDiane Foley said on Twitter on Sunday that she hopes 'this will hinder the resurgence of terror groups'\n\nOn June 29, 2014, the group released a video showing a man purporting to be al-Baghdadi giving a sermon at a Mosul mosque.\n\nPresident Barack Obama launched airstrikes against IS beginning that August. He acted after thousands of Iraqi Yazidis, followers of an ancient religion with ties to Zoroastrianism, were targeted by al-Baghdadi's fighters, and to safeguard U.S. interests, including a consulate in the Iraqi Kurdish regional capital of Irbil.\n\nIslamic State militants responded by beheading Western captives, beginning with freelance American journalist James Foley, and posting their deeds in gruesome online videos.\n\nPictured, President Trump announces the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Washington DC on Sunday\n\nThis November 2012, file photo, posted on the website freejamesfoley.org, shows American journalist James Foley while covering the civil war in Aleppo, Syria\n\nThis file image made from video posted on a militant website Saturday, July 5, 2014, purports to show the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, delivering a sermon at a mosque in Iraq during his first public appearance\n\nIslamic State militants responded to Obama-led airstrikes in August 2014 by beheading Western captives, beginning with freelance American journalist James Foley.

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead,' Trump said from the Diplomatic Reception Room, where just a week earlier he announced a ceasefire between Turkey and the Kurds.\n\n'He was the founder and leader of ISIS, the most ruthless and violent terror organization anywhere in the world,' he continued as he described the events of the raid.\n\n'He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way. They were led to certain death,' Trump detailed. 'He reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children. His body was mutilated by the blast, the tunnel had caved in on it, in addition.\n\n'But test results gave certain, immediate and totally positive identification. It was him. The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him.'\n\nPeople look at a destroyed houses near the village of Barisha, in Idlib province, Syria, Sunday", "description": "James Foley's mother has said that President Trump phoned her after the Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi raid on Sunday that killed the ISIS leader to personally inform her the terror leader was dead.", "authors": ["James Nye For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/21/20300556-0-image-a-17_1572299648818.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
