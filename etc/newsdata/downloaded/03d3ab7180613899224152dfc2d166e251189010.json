We support this policy which reinforces that domestic violence has no place in our society and cannot be tolerated.\n\n\"We have followed the lead of Major League Baseball and will continue to provide our complete cooperation throughout the investigative process. We reserve any further comment until the investigation reaches its conclusion. All questions pertaining to this matter should be directed to the Office of the Commissioner.\"\n\nNew York manager Aaron Boone said he wasn't totally caught off guard by the situation.\n\n\"I learned on the drive [to Yankee Stadium] that he was going on the administrative leave,\" Boone told reporters. \"I heard some of the whispers and whatnot [prior], but this is a Major League Baseball investigation and issue. So we're just trying to be as cooperative as we can while this goes on.\"\n\nAlthough no timetable for a final MLB decision was announced, the \"investigation is expected to be fast-tracked,\" per ESPN's Jeff Passan.\n\nOn the field, German was putting the final touches on a breakout 2019 season. He posted an 18-4 record with a 4.03 ERA, 1.15 WHIP and 153 strikeouts in 143 innings across 27 games (24 starts).\n\nThe 27-year-old Dominican Republic native provided valuable depth during the Yanks' injury-plagued campaign and was a strong contender to earn a postseason rotation spot alongside Masahiro Tanaka, James Paxton and either J.A. Happ or Luis Severino, depending on the latter's health.\n\nGerman's expected absence could bring CC Sabathia back into the starting conversation for the playoffs.", "description": "New York Yankees  starting pitcher  Domingo German  will reportedly miss the rest of the 2019  MLB  season, including the playoffs, after being placed on administrative leave Thursday under the league's domestic violence policy...", "authors": ["Tim Daniels"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/829/151/hi-res-b70c1c9739607de6b1ab63a246ab77bf_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
