Frugal, he saves regularly in RRSPs and TFSAs and has accumulated assets of $2.9 million. He also has a mortgage for his home and mortgages and credit lines for three rental properties. The total of all that debt is $952,000. He has a modest car, spends little on travel and entertainment and lives inexpensively. His goal is to pay off his debts, retire in five years and spend half the year in the tropics. But with three mortgages to pay, the transition needs to be simplified.\n\n(E-mail andrew.allentuck@gmail.com for a free Family Finance analysis.)\n\nTransitioning to retirement\n\nSteve wants to start winding down his time-consuming property investments so that, when retired, he can spend half the year down south. The problem is how to do it. His interest rates range from 2.84 per cent for his home to 4.45 per cent for his line of credit, which he uses to run the rental units.\n\nFamily Finance asked Derek Moran, head of Smarter Financial Planning Ltd. in Kelowna, B.C., to work with Steve.\n\n\u201cThe problems here are tactical (which mortgage or line of credit to pay down first) and strategic (what rate of paydown should he use),\u201d Moran says.\n\nFirst move: restructure his most expensive loan, the $28,000 line of credit that costs him 4.45 per cent per year. He could blend the credit line into one of the rental mortgages and reduce the loan rate to less than three per cent, Moran suggests. That move alone could save him $400 per year.\n\nSecond move: use $74,680 in idle cash to pay down the $191,000 mortgage outstanding on his home. The house generates no income. If $64,000 cash is used, his home mortgage would drop from $191,000 to $127,000. The present 20-year amortization would decline to about 11 years. In five years, when he would like to retire, he would still have six years left on the mortgage. He could increase the present payments of $1,562 per month to $2,562 per month. On retirement, his home would be debt-free.\n\nThird move: make the rentals more profitable. The three rentals generate net rents of $9,996 per year (unit A), $30,974 per year (unit B) and $12,216 per year (unit C) and have returns on equity (income before tax divided by market price less debt of the property) of 2.7 per cent, 4.4 per cent and 3.06 per cent, respectively. The rental with 4.4 per cent ROE is the most profitable, but there is a quirk in tax law that makes selling this one the wisest move. Steve has owned the unit, which he bought for $575,000 and which now has an estimated value of $1 million, for 12 years. Since he lived in it for seven of those years, he can claim two-thirds as exempt from capital gains (the Income Tax Act allows an extra year of credit). That means only one third of his $425,000 capital gain would be taxable. Given a 50 per cent inclusion rate and assuming a 30 per cent tax rate on the extra income, he might owe as little as $20,000 in taxes. After paying off the $296,000 mortgage, he could net $684,000.\n\nIf Steve sets aside $50,000 and invests the remaining $634,000 of that in dividend growth stocks, he could have a 4.5 per cent return (plus growth) of $28,530 of Canadian dividend income, Moran estimates. That would be a little less than his current income, but it would have the benefit of the dividend tax credit. Moreover, dividends tend to grow two or three times faster than the rate at which he is allowed to raise rents. Finally, sale and investment in stocks would cut Steve\u2019s 80 per cent plus allocation to real estate. That would add safety.\n\nSteve should boost his RRSPs which at present total $147,500. His contribution room is just $7,000 per year, but if he maintains contributions and that sum grows at three per cent per year after inflation, it will become $208,000 in five years. That lump sum could then pay $10,400 per year for the next 31 years to his age 90, Moran notes.\n\nHis $57,500 TFSA growing with $400 monthly contributions at three per cent for five years would become $92,150 and support payouts with no tax of $4,475 per year.\n\nAt 59, Steve would have rents of $22,212 assuming he sells his most profitable unit, B, and $10,399 from his RRSP, and $28,530 dividend income and $4,475 from his TFSA. That\u2019s a total of $65,616. If the non-TFSA flows are taxed at 19 per cent, he would have $4,500 per month to spend.\n\nIn retirement, with expenses including $800 per month for his line of credit, $1,632 for the home mortgage, $430 property tax and maintenance, $600 RRSP and $400 TFSA monthly savings removed, Steve\u2019s living expenses would drop by $3,862 per month to just $2,538 per month, meaning he would have plenty of room left over.\n\nAt age 65, Steve can add his Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security benefits to the mix. He will have earned 80 per cent of the $13,855 CPP maximum \u2014 or $11,084 \u2014 and $7,290 in OAS. He will also get $984 annually from a pension for a former job.\n\nTotal cash flow would be $80,500. Assuming a tax rate of 20 per cent and a slight OAS clawback of $689 per year since he is over the trigger point of $75,910, would leave Steve with spendable annual income of $68,186 or $5,680 per month.\n\nHis margin of income over cost would be $3,362 monthly, which is more than enough to fund a six-month stay somewhere warm.\n\nRisk management\n\nIf Steve does move to the tropics for half a year, he should inquire about costs of long-term medical care or Canadian travel medical insurance, perhaps a low-cost policy with a hefty deductible. Without that coverage, he would be at risk of having an illness devastate his savings, Moran notes.\n\n\u201cThis is the story of a man with an average income, a solid focus on building up wealth, a good retirement plan and enough spare income in retirement to overcome a few bumps,\u201d Moran says. However, with a debt-management plan and some reduction in his property allocation, his retirement goal is achievable, his income secure.\u201d\n\nRetirement stars: Four *** out of five\n\nFinancial Post\n\nE-mail andrew.allentuck@gmail.com for a free Family Finance analysis.", "description": "This plan gives Steve a way to tackle his debt and provides more than enough to fund a six-month stay somewhere warm", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/fp1019-family-finance-3.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
