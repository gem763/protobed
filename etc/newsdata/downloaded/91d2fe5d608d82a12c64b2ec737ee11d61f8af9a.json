He told The Associated Press on Saturday: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get the point where science is determined by politics rather than science and facts. And I\u2019m afraid this is an example where this is beginning to occur.\u201d\u2026\n\n\u201cThis falls into such uncharted territory,\u201d said W. Craig Fugate, who was Florida emergency management chief under Republican Gov. Jeb Bush and director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency under Democratic President Barack Obama. \u201cYou have science organizations putting out statements against their own offices. For the life of me I don\u2019t think I would have ever faced this under President Obama or Governor Bush.\u201d\n\nJane Lubchenco, NOAA administrator during the Obama administration said: \u201cIt is truly sad to see political appointees undermining the superb, life-saving work of NOAA\u2019s talented and dedicated career servants.
