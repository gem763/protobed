I'd never played Blinkova before, so there is also that added stress not knowing what she can do.\n\n\"For me, that stress was taken away today.

I was fighting.\"\n\nTeenage wild card Coco Gauff is through after a 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 win over Hungarian qualifier Timea Babos.\n\nPA", "description": "Simona Halep's advice to Taylor Townsend came back to bite her after the American qualifier dumped the Wimbledon champion out of the US Open.
