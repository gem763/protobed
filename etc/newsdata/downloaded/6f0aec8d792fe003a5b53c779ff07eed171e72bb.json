That is not true,\" Ward said as Rotellini tried to continue.\n\nArizona Democrat Party Chairman Felecia Rotellini: Trump \u201chas aligned himself with ISIS\u201d\n\n\n\nRotellini made the remarks on Saturday, approximately 1-hour before a Trump-authorized raid in northern Syria resulted in the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi pic.twitter.com/lyYraFg6Eq\n\n\n\n\u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 29, 2019\n\nWho is Alexander Vindman: The White House expert who testified about Trump\u2019s Ukraine call?\n\n'Poor choice of words'\n\nThe remarks came as American forces began a raid in Syria that trapped Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the world's most wanted terrorist, who blew himself up in a tunnel, along with three children, according to Trump's telling of al-Baghdadi's final moments.\n\n\"It was a poor choice of words,\" Matt Grodsky, spokesman for the Arizona Democratic Party, said in an email to The Arizona Republic on Tuesday.\n\nGrodsky said the comments stemmed from \"President Trump's haphazard decision to withdraw troops from Syria, which has been opposed by Republicans and Democrats alike because it abandoned our Kurdish allies in the fight against ISIS, empowered Iran, Russia, and the Syrian regime, and hurt our interests in the region.\"\n\nWard, who has had more than a few cringe-inducing remarks of her own, hit back at Rotellini for what she viewed as slanderous comments.\n\n\"It is extremely disconcerting to hear the top Democrat in Arizona slander and malign an innocent person for being aligned with the world\u2019s most evil terrorists, let alone the president of the United States,\" she said.\n\n\"While fear-mongering from the left is expected up to a point, we have to draw the line somewhere if they\u2019re going to refuse to police themselves. Baseless statements like those made by the chair of the Arizona (Democratic Party) are wildly irresponsible and not rooted in reality.\"\n\nJeffrey Epstein: Private pathologist questions whether Epstein died by suicide\n\nComment stems from Syrian troop withdrawal\n\nRotellini's comment came as people across the political spectrum wrestled with Trump's decision to withdraw at least some troops from northern Syria after the Turkish offensive into the territory previously held by Kurds aligned with the U.S.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans alike said the move empowered ISIS and sent a bad message to U.S. allies.\n\nTrump gained a measure of redemption with the announcement Sunday that al-Baghdadi was dead.\n\nThe credit has proven fleeting for the administration, amid reports that Trump's withdrawal orders forced the Pentagon to speed up the long-planned raid on al-Baghdadi's location.\n\nThe New York Times reported that U.S. officials determined his whereabouts with a tip and collaboration with Iraqi and Kurdish intelligence officials.\n\nFollow Ronald J.
