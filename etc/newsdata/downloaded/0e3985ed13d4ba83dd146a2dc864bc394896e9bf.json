Users in this area will get an option called Uber Pet.\n\nThe new addition however, won't come free as Uber will be charging a small surcharge fee (ranging from $3 or Rs 210 to $5 or Rs 350 ) to take your furry friend with you. The fee will be displayed in the receipt that the rider will receive upon the completion of the ride.\n\nThis cool feature comes after lots of people in the US complained about Uber drivers cancelling the rides upon finding out that a pet is going to join the ride. This was either due to cleanliness concerns or due to allergies.\n\nDon't Miss 782 SHARES 969 SHARES 171 SHARES 1.8 K SHARES\n\nHowever, now drivers who don't mind carrying pets in their vehicles can opt for this and Uber will also pay a sizeable chunk from the surcharge with the driver.\n\nUber\n\nOne crucial thing to note here is the fact that service animals don't come under the Uber Pets category and can travel using standard Uber Go without any surcharge or additional fees. This is with accordance to the state and federal law in the US.\n\nThe testing for this app is limited to the aforementioned states, and it isn't coming to India anytime soon. But looking at the size of market Uber has captured in metro cities across India, the inclusion of this feature could surely be very helpful for humans and their pets to commute through the city safely and comfortably.", "description": "Uber is soon going to allow pets to be a part of your ride.
