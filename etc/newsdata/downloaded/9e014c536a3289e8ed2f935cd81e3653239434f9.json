That indicates that it\u2019s possible the Jaguars would trade Ramsey for two first-round picks if they came from a team with a losing record.\n\nThe indications out of Jacksonville have been that owner Shad Khan wants to keep Ramsey, while front office boss Tom Coughlin is ready to get rid of him. Perhaps a great trade offer could help Coughlin persuade Khan, but it would have to be better than the offers the Jaguars have received so far.", "description": "Despite Jalen Ramsey missing the first game of his career on Sunday after demanding a trade and taking time off practice, the Jaguars don't want to trade him.
