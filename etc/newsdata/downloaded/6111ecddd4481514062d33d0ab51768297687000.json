The House passed the legislation in May. It has not yet been brought to the Senate floor.\n\nIn August, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to essentially legalize anti-gay discrimination in the workplace, arguing in an amicus brief that the federal laws on employer discrimination in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were not intended to protect individuals from being fired based on their sexual orientation.\n\nPelosi met earlier this year with Van Ness and three of his \u201cQueer Eye\u201d co-stars as well as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), to talk policy and promote the bill.\n\nOn Thursday, Pelosi shared her own image of herself and Van Ness warmly holding hands on a balcony, thanking him for bringing his voice to the fight:\n\nSuch a pleasure to see you again today, @jvn. Your courage & commitment to building a better, more accepting world for all is an inspiration. Thank you for lending your voice to the ongoing fight for the #EqualityAct. pic.twitter.com/I8oAe1gRnB \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) September 27, 2019", "description": "The \"Queer Eye\" star and the House speaker met on Capitol Hill to discuss the Equality Act and taking down discrimination against LGBTQ people.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8da59d2200006b0353323e.jpeg?cache=f4m7mvxpuc&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
