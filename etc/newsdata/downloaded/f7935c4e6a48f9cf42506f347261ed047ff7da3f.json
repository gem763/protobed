But I feel like I\u2019m watching a completely different show\u2026\u2019\n\nThe scores were all over the place (Picture: BBC)\n\nDr Ranj believes celebs have a responsibility to speak out (Picture: Splash News)\n\nSpeaking to Metro.co.uk at the Pink News Awards, the 40-year-old said: \u2018I think we were all just really surprised. I\u2019m surprised at the result, I think the nation is surprised at the result, but it just goes to show that anything can happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If you want to keep someone in, you have to vote.\u2019\n\nAnd Dr Ranj\u2019s vote is going towards his old partner Janette Manrara and Will Bayley \u2013 although he has some other favourites too.\n\nThe This Morning doctor said: \u2018I\u2019m always gonna vote Will and Janette. They are my frontrunners, they are the ones I want in the final. But, do you know what, Karim and Kelvin have good chances, and Michelle Visage is in with a good chance.\n\nDr Ranj is supporting Janette Manrara (Picture: PA/BBC)\n\n\u2018It would be incredible to see an older lady in the final. The last time was Debbie McGee, and she was incredible \u2013 who knows, Michelle could carry that baton.\u2019\n\nDr Ranj looked slick at the Pink News Awards, held at Church House in Westminster, wearing a bottle green suit with statement necklaces over a white shirt.\n\nAnd he told us that he feels all LGBTQ+ celebrities have a responsibility to be vocal about issues in the community.\n\nHe said: \u2018I don\u2019t think anyone really wants to get on a soap box about it, but I think if you are part of any minority community and you have a platform, then you have an automatic responsibility to that community to make things better.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn that note, Dr Ranj discussed the rise in hate crimes, with transgender hate crimes rising by 37% and crimes motivated by sexual orientation going up by a quarter over the past year.\n\n\u2018I think it\u2019s really really sad,\u2019 he said. \u2018And the shocking thing is that hate crimes across the board are going up, not just within the LGBT+ community. It\u2019s something we need to sit up and pay attention to and something we actually need to do something about.\n\n\u2018These are people\u2019s lives and livelihoods we\u2019re talking about. No-one deserves to be discriminated against or persecuted \u2013 especially in the UK, we\u2019re supposed to be the developed world, we\u2019re supposed to be leading the way with equal rights.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
