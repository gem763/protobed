The utility will have to deploy thousands of inspectors to make sure the lines were not damaged in the wind, or else they could ignite a fire.\n\nThe job is so massive that 1,000 out-of-state workers will assist, some from as far away as Florida under a mutual aid system. Helicopter crews and drones will fly over the lines as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe blackouts were being conducted in seven phases, and as of Sunday night the company had completed six, with one more to be announced.\n\nThe sixth outage hit customers in Kern County about 9 p.m. Sunday. A seventh will hit additional customers in Fresno and Madera counties, but the timing of that shutdown had not yet been determined.\n\n\u201cSome customers may see power back on sooner,\u201d Tostado said. She added that if the utility began inspections before the winds stopped, it would just have to conduct a second inspection later.\n\nThe cause of the Kincade fire is still under investigation, but some suspicion is already turning to transmission lines owned by PG&E. The utility said one of its transmission lines experienced problems Wednesday night around the area where the fire broke out.\n\nIn a mandatory report sent to the California Public Utilities Commission, the company said one of its workers noticed that the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection had taped off the area. PG&E said Cal Fire also pointed out a \u201cbroken jumper on the same tower.\u201d\n\nThe broken jumper cable could have sent a powerful discharge of current through the tower to the ground, said Michael Wara, director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford University.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a lightning strike,\u201d Wara said. \u201cThe millisecond that jumper broke, you would have had that happen.\u201d\n\nThe policy of shutting down power emerged in recent years in California, but the full effect of the strategy did not become apparent until the recent fire season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe state\u2019s major utilities were given an expanded set of rules to implement these power downs by the California Public Utilities Commission in a unanimous decision by the five-member board in May.\n\nPG&E is by a wide margin the state\u2019s largest utility, and Tostado said the current outage is the biggest it has implemented. San Diego Gas & Electric pioneered what is now called \u201cpublic safety power shut-offs,\u201d and the largest it ever conducted affected 23,000 customers in November.\n\nCutting power for five days to a million customers far exceeds national averages, according to federal data.\n\nThe average electrical outage even with \u201cmajor events,\u201d such as ice or wind storms, runs four hours, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. South Carolina ranks the worst with an average duration of 20 hours. New York and Nevada rank the best.\n\nHurricane Maria, which hit Puerto Rico and the East Coast, caused the nation\u2019s most protracted power loss, measured as 3,393 million customer-hours of outage.\n\nEven if the PG&E outage hits 1 million customers for a full five days, that would amount to just 120 million customer hours of outage.", "description": "Intentional blackouts of this magnitude in unprecedented in California history", "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Ralph Vartabedian", "A National Correspondent At The Los Angeles Times", "Joined The Newspaper In"], "top_image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f992096/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+141/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Faf%2F70%2F1009754fe3d773f82a71078df0e6%2Fla-1562797343-bnobqef77w-snap-image", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
