Perhaps she\u2019s saving that one for the last dance with Boris.\n\nJohn Simpson, the BBC\u2019s veteran world affairs editor, is escaping the Brexit miasma by flying to the Middle East.\n\nSays the old newshound: \u2018I\u2019ll get away from political extremism, threats against decent, moderate politicians, anxieties that the Government will break the law, and a sense of despair about the direction the country is heading in. Yes, Iraq will be a doddle.\u2019\n\nThe Cabinet Office has issued a warning that \u2018subversive\u2019 individuals with \u2018historic links to violent extremist groups\u2019 and who advocate \u2018undermining parliamentary democracy\u2019 will fail the vetting process for Whitehall security clearance.\n\nNo word yet on how Jeremy Corbyn, who notoriously referred to Hamas and Hezbollah as \u2018friends\u2019, plans to get past the guards.\n\nHezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah is pictured above earlier this month in Lebanon. No word yet on how Jeremy Corbyn, who notoriously referred to Hamas and Hezbollah as \u2018friends\u2019, plans to get past the guards\n\nFormer Tory Cabinet minister Rory Stewart, who is running as an independent in the London mayoral race, last month declared he \u2018would bend the knee\u2019 and abandon politics if Boris Johnson secured a new deal from the EU.\n\nHas anyone heard from him since?\n\nLib Dem's marrow victory\n\nOne of the candidates running to be the president of the Liberal Democrats is veteran activist Mark Pack, best known for co-writing the 2012 book 101 Ways To Win An Election.\n\nMr Pack\u2019s eccentric insights include: \u2018What a vegetable marrow tells you about political campaigning\u2019 and \u2018why you must learn to hate trees\u2019.\n\nA Lib Dem tax on courgettes and sycamores: you read it here first.\n\nQuote of the week: Brexiteer Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, on Boris\u2019s deal: \u2018It looks like Brexit, it smells like Brexit. That\u2019s Brexit for me.\u2019", "description": "ANDREW PIERCE: With the Brexit psychodrama hogging all the headlines last week, Jeremy Corbyn seized his chance to slip out the Labour Party's annual report.", "authors": ["Andrew Pierce For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/00/19970174-0-image-a-15_1571615495434.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
