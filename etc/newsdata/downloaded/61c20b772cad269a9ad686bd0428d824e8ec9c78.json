(Danny Moloshok/Reuters)\n\nNBC News employees announced Wednesday the formation of a union in the wake of internal criticism directed at executives over their handling of past incidents of work-related sexual misconduct by upper-level management.\n\n\u201cWe love working at NBC News Digital. But no organization is perfect, and there are serious issues that keep the company from being as great as it can be,\u201d the group \u2014 titled \u201cNBC Guild\u201d \u2014 states on its website. \u201cA company with such incredible resources can and should do more to close gender and race wage gaps, address chronic understaffing, meaningfully prioritize diversity, promote transparency, and offer job protections.\u201d\n\nThe guild, which has accumulated the support of approximately 75 percent of eligible colleagues, makes several demands of NBC, including that the company prioritize \u201ctransparency and sensitivity\u201d in the handling of sexual misconduct allegations, and ensure \u201cthat diversity inside the newsroom is a priority.\u201d\n\nThe union says that it has requested for management to voluntarily recognize the group\u2019s collective bargaining representative, NewsGuild.\n\n\u201cWe can address these issues, but only if management works with us. We seek to build a more equitable workplace in order to enhance the quality and breadth of our journalism and continue to work in the newsroom that we love,\u201d the union\u2019s statement reads. \u201cForming a union will afford us a collective voice in decisions that will benefit the entire company, providing much-needed transparency and ensuring a safer workplace.\u201d\n\nNBC has been dogged by negative press in recent weeks, largely stemming from allegations revealed in former NBC journalist Ronan Farrow\u2019s new book, \u201cCatch and Kill.\u201d\n\nFarrow accuses NBC of reaching secretive nondisclosure agreements with alleged victims of disgraced Today Show host Matt Lauer\u2019s sexual abuse. The New Yorker writer also claims that NBC executives tried to stop him from investigating sexual abuse claims against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein out of fear that the film producer would expose Lauer\u2019s behavior and their complicity in it.\n\nAfter NBC President Noah Oppenheim called Farrow\u2019s accusations a \u201csmear\u201d and sent a letter to employees calling the story a \u201cconspiracy theory,\u201d MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes backed Farrow on his primetime show.\n\n\u201cOne thing . . . is indisputable,\u201d Hayes said on October 14. \u201cFarrow walked out of NBC News after working on the Weinstein story and within two months published an incredible article in the New Yorker, that not only won a Pulitzer but helped trigger a massive social and cultural reckoning that continues to this day.\u201d\n\nSeveral days later, NBC confirmed that it would not pursue an outside investigation into Farrow\u2019s claims. An internal investigation from 2018 found that NBC officials had not received formal complaints regarding Lauer\u2019s conduct before November 27, 2017.", "description": "NBC News employees announced Wednesday a union in the wake of internal criticism at executives over their handling of work-related sexual misconduct.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Zachary Evans", "Frederick M.
