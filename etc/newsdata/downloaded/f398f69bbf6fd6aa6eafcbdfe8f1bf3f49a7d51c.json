Albeit not the single massive blow which has been his undergoing at key moments earlier in his career.\n\nDereck Chisora cruised to an easy win over David Price following a fourth round TKO\n\nPrice soon felt the weight of constant Chisora attacks from the third round\n\nChisora celebrates his win against Price who looks on with dejection\n\nPrice had weathered a serious of massive right hands from the start and it took a double whammy to put him down in the fourth, an uppercut and a hook.\n\nStill he was able to drag that huge frame upright but referee Howard Foster was alarmed. Even as he asked Price if he was alright to continue \u2013 and doubting the nodding response \u2013 Price's cornermen threw in the towel.\n\nThe end of the road, perhaps, for Price but a corner turned for Chisora.\n\nHis manager and former heavyweight champion David Haye said: 'There is a now good chance of Dereck getting a world title shot next year as one of two of the belts fall vacant.'\n\nChisora made his entrance as usual with his face concealed by a red, white and blue Union flag under a white hood to match his embossed robe.\n\nPrice, of course, was in red.\n\nPrice was defenseless as Chisora rallied in a series of big hits in the fourth round\n\nPrice's corner soon threw in the towel two minutes into the fourth round as the pair embrace\n\nChisora, befitting his new pseudonym, went on the attack from the start, clearly winning the first even though he charged into three or four meaty punches from Price late in the round.\n\nChisora was warned twice for low blows, one so low it might have performed a cartilage operation on Price's knee.\n\nNo doubt to the surprise of Chisora and most of the audience, Price absorbed a succession of huge rights in the third, any one of which might have put him down and perhaps out in the past.\n\nMore of the same in the fourth proved too much, too heavy, too redolent of serious harm.\n\nPrice finally went down from a pair of rights \u2013 uppercut and hook. Gamely he rose to his fight and referee Foster was debating whether to call a halt when the white towel came fluttering across the ring.\n\nChisora makes his way out to the ring ahead of the fight at the O2 Arena", "description": "JEFF POWELL AT THE 02 ARENA: Derek Chisora battered his way back to the fringe of world heavyweight title contention with a relentless brutalising of Davd Price.", "authors": ["Jeff Powell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/22/20227326-0-image-a-53_1572126633527.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
