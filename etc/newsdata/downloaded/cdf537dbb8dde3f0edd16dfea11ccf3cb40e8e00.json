(Michael Kappeler/dpa via AP)\n\nHONG KONG (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the protests in Hong Kong (all times local):\n\n8.40 p.m.\n\nThousands of Hong Kong soccer fans have booed and turned their backs when the Chinese national anthem was played before a World Cup qualifier match against Iran.\n\nThe crowd broke out into \"Glory to Hong Kong,\" a song reflecting their months-long fight for more democratic freedoms in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.\n\nAfter the match started, fans also chanted \"Free Hong Kong\" and \"Revolution of our Times.\"\n\nSecurity was tight, with fans frisked to ensure they did not bring political materials and other prohibited items into the 40,000-seat Hong Kong Stadium. Iran had earlier sought to move the match, citing the unrest, but the request was rejected by FIFA, soccer's ruling body.\n\n___\n\n5:50 p.m.\n\nChina has sharply criticized Germany for a meeting with Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong.\n\nForeign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Tuesday that China has complained to Germany about Wong's current trip to the European country and his meeting with Foreign Minister Heiko Maas.\n\nShe called Wong a separatist and said Germany had allowed him to enter \"to engage in anti-China separatist activities.\"\n\nWong and Maas met in Berlin late Monday at an event hosted by the German newspaper Bild.\n\nHua said no foreign government has the right to intervene in Hong Kong affairs because they are an internal Chinese matter. She urged Germany to avoid sending the wrong signal to \"radical, separatist forces in Hong Kong.\"\n\n___\n\n11:50 a.m.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam renews an appeal to pro-democracy protesters to halt violence and engage in dialogue, as the city's richest man urged the government to provide a way out for the mostly young demonstrators.\n\nThe government last week promised to axe the extradition bill that sparked the three months of protests but failed to placate protesters, whose demands also include democratic reforms and police accountability.\n\nLam said Tuesday the escalation of violence over the weekend, where over 150 people including students were detained during clashes, will deepen rifts and prolong the road to recovery.\n\nBillionaire Li Ka Shing said in a video broadcast on local TV that the government should temper justice with mercy. The 91-year-old Li described the unrest as the worst catastrophe since World War II.", "description": "Thousands of Hong Kong soccer fans have booed and turned their backs when the Chinese national anthem was played before a World Cup qualifier match against Iran.
