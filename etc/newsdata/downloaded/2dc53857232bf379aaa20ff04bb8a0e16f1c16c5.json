I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re the president of the United States or anybody else,\u201d De Blasio said, according to Politico.\n\n\u201cIf you shoot someone, you should get arrested, and we would arrest him.\u201d\n\nPolice would arrest Trump for a shooting, just the same as anybody else, Tucker added.\n\nDe Blasio also berated Consovoy for his rhetoric, saying that nobody is above the law.\n\n\u201cAnyone who calls themselves a lawyer who would say that, should not be a lawyer,\u201d de Blasio said.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s longstanding view is that a sitting president cannot be charged with federal crimes. Last year, Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said that Trump could not be indicted even if he shot former FBI Director James Comey.", "description": "Trump's lawyer said the president could shoot somebody in Manhattan and still skirt charges.
