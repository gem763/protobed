He then compounded that by throwing several lawmakers out of the party, making it almost impossible for him to win votes in parliament.\n\nThe Conservatives are ahead of Labour by an average of about 10 percentage points in polls this month, indicating a majority in the 650-seat parliament for Johnson, though pollsters admit their models are imperfect with turnout a key variable.", "description": "Johnson and Corbyn hit the campaign trail for UK Christmas election", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9T239_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
