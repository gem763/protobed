The city will use facial-recognition cameras for the procedure soon\n\nChina is currently building the world's largest surveillance system that aims to recognise any of its 1.4 billion citizens within three seconds. The state-led network is set to complete in 2020\n\nThe subway monitoring scheme is designed to speed up security scans in the city's overcrowded metro, announced Zhan Minghui, director of the Beijing Rail Traffic Control Center.\n\nSpeaking at a transport forum this week, Mr Zhan said that the city's authority were due to use a 'credit system' to classify commuters, state news agency Xinhua reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe city plans to install cameras that will screen the faces of passengers as they enter a subway station and sort them into different security channels, according to Mr Zhan.\n\nChina is on track to have one CCTV camera for nearly every two people as the Communist Party pushes for Big-Brother-style state surveillance. The country's 1.4 billion population will be carefully watched by 626 million street monitors as early as next year, according to a study\n\nThe plan involves creating a 'passenger credit system'. Individuals on a 'white list' will enjoy expedited security clearance.\n\nThose who receive 'abnormal feedback' after their faces are scanned will be subjected to extra checks.\n\nMr Zhan did not offer details on the criteria used to sort passengers, or what could trigger that type of feedback.\n\n'The technique aims to improve the efficiency of security checks and includes both body checks and luggage screening when large numbers of passengers enter the station,' he told the forum on Tuesday.\n\nGuangzhou and Shenzhen have already adopted facial-recognition security measures\n\nBeijing's 23 subway lines currently handle over 12 million trips on a weekday and the number is expected to increase to 17 million trips by 2022.\n\nThe busy network includes 394 stations and 678 kilometres (421 miles) of tracks. The latter is roughly twice the distance between London and Paris.\n\nMr Zhan did not give a timetable for rolling out the technology.\n\nSeveral other Chinese cities have already adopted facial-recognition technology in subway.\n\nCommuters in Guangzhou can now gain speedy passage through the security checkpoints after registering their information and pictures on an official app.\n\nThe city adopted the technology last month.\n\nChina is currently building the world's largest surveillance system, which aims to recognise any of its 1.4 billion citizens within three seconds.\n\nThe security network, set to be finished next year, will be equipped with 626 million street monitors, or one camera for nearly every two people, according to a study.\n\nThe network consists of the 'Sky Net Project' and the 'Sharp Eye Project' and is part of the nation's 13th five-year plan.\n\nChina's AI-powered surveillance network also supports the nation's social credit system\n\nCritics, however, have voiced concerns over the system, claiming it is a way for the government to invade citizens' privacy and restrict their freedom.\n\nMany have also compared it to a dystopian system run by a fictional state leader, Big Brother, in English author George Orwell's novel 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'.\n\nChina's surveillance network also supports the nation's social credit system, which rates its citizens based on their daily activities.\n\nExperts say the system, combined with face-recognition technology, is a way for the authority to control citizens' behaviour.\n\n'State-led face recognition efforts also tie into the country's social credit system, so passengers who misbehave would be subject to additional searches and screenings,' said privacy expert Paul Bischoff in reference to Beijing's subway monitoring plan.\n\n'Because the social credit rating is affected by many activities outside of the subway, actions that people take in their daily life can limit how they can travel,' added Mr Bischoff who penned a report about the world's most-monitored cities this year.\n\nThe world's five most-monitored cities are Chongqing, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Tianjin and Ji'nan\n\nOnce complete next year, China's social credit system could determine how easy a citizen could rent a flat, buy travel tickets or pay for a cup of tea.\n\nThe system will help the country restore morality, according to China's state-run newspaper Global Times.\n\nLatest statistics show the Chinese social credit system blocked what it called 'discredited entities' from taking 2.56 million flights and 90,000 high-speed train journeys in July alone.", "description": "The AI-powered security facilities are set to be rolled out in metro stations in Beijing.
