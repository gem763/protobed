REUTERS/Ciro de Luca\n\nRoberto Gualtieri, the former head of the European Parliament\u2019s economic and monetary affairs committee, told daily la Repubblica that the new government would not challenge European Union budget rules but would seek to change them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going (to Helsinki) to discuss European policies, starting from the need of a more expansionary fiscal policy,\u201d he said ahead of Friday\u2019s euro zone finance ministers\u2019 meeting in Finland.\n\nSources have told Reuters Italy\u2019s new government plans to raise its budget deficit to around 2.3% of economic output next year.\n\n\u201cWe support the idea of a Green New Deal ... based on public and private investments. In this context, the portion of domestic financing ... should be excluded from structural deficit calculations,\u201d Gualtieri added.\n\nThe structural deficit is adjusted to take into account the economic cycle and one-off items.\n\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire on Friday urged the EU to define clearly what qualifies as green investment.\n\nGualtieri said defraying a scheduled sales tax hike would be the priority for the upcoming 2020 budget, while the timeframe for proposed tax cuts for lower-income workers and companies that invest to innovate would be three years.\n\nHe pledged to reduce Italy\u2019s 2.3 trillion euro public debt, so as to further lower its cost, by fighting tax evasion and reviewing tax expenditures.\n\nItaly\u2019s borrowing costs have fallen sharply in recent weeks as a new coalition comprising the centre-left Democratic Party and the 5-Star Movement (M5S) replaced a government made up of the M5S and the right-wing League.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve paid very dearly in terms of interest payments on the debt, lower confidence and investments as well as Italy\u2019s loss of influence in Brussels due to the League\u2019s ambiguous and conflictual relationship with Europe,\u201d Gualtieri said.\n\n\u201cClashes with Europe, slogans on social networks and the boycotting of negotiating tables are over.\u201d", "description": "The euro zone needs a more supportive fiscal policy, Italy's new economy minister said in a newspaper interview on Friday, adding that spending on green investments should not count towards a country's budget deficit.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429326790&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0D0", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
