halt Turkish assault on Kurds", "language": "en", "text": "Tall Tamr (Syria) (AFP) \u2013 The Syrian regime sent troops towards the Turkish border on Monday to contain Ankara\u2019s deadly offensive against the Kurds, stepping in for US forces due to begin a controversial withdrawal.\n\nOutgunned and without US protection, the autonomous Kurds in northeastern Syria had few other options to stop the rapid advance of Turkish troops and their Syrian proxies.\n\nTurkey wants to create a roughly 30-kilometre (20-mile) buffer zone along its border to keep Kurdish forces at bay and also to send back some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees it hosts.\n\nThe United States and its partners \u2014 who spent years fighting the Islamic State group in Syria before deserting them \u2014 have condemned the Turkish invasion but their threats of sanctions have failed to stop it.\n\nThe chaos in the areas targeted in the six-day-old Turkish assault has already led to the escape of around 800 foreign women and children linked to IS from a Kurdish-run camp, Kurdish authorities said.\n\nThe Kurds had repeatedly warned of that scenario when Western countries refused to repatriate their IS-linked nationals and when US President Donald Trump made it clear he wanted to end US military presence.\n\nWasting no time to fill the void, Moscow \u2014 already the top broker in Syria \u2014 clinched a deal between the Kurds and Damascus, whose ties had been icy since the minority threw its lot with Washington and unilaterally declared self-rule.\n\n\u201cIn order to prevent and confront this aggression, an agreement has been reached with the Syrian government,\u201d the Kurdish administration said in a statement late Sunday.\n\n\u2013 Averting \u2018genocide\u2019 \u2013\n\nIn an editorial published in Foreign Policy magazine, the head of the main Kurdish force wrote: \u201cIf we have to choose between compromises and the genocide of our people, we will surely choose life for our people.\u201d\n\nBy Monday morning, Syrian government forces were already moving to within several kilometres (miles) of the border, AFP correspondents on the ground said.\n\nResidents around the town of Tall Tamr welcomed regime forces with cheers and Syrian state television showed some of them waving national flags and portraits of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nAccording to a newspaper close to the Damascus regime, Syrian forces were also expected to deploy in the areas of Manbij and the border town of Kobane.\n\nThe main remaining flashpoint along the border was the town of Ras al-Ain, where Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have been putting up stiff resistance against Turkish air strikes and shelling for almost a week.\n\nAccording to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, the Turkish attack \u2014 which uses Syrian proxies on the ground \u2014 has already left 121 SDF fighters and 60 civilians dead.\n\n\u2013 Rising toll \u2013\n\nAn air strike on a convoy that included SDF fighters, civilians and journalists Sunday killed at least 10 people in the Ras al-Ain area.\n\nFootage circulated by local media showed gruesome scenes taken moments after the hit, with bodies strewn amidst the convoy\u2019s vehicles.\n\nAFP reporters said overwhelmed medics in a hospital in Qamishli struggled to treat the wounded, several of whom were in critical condition.\n\nOn the Turkish side, four soldiers and 18 civilians have been confirmed killed in six days, either in fighting or from Kurdish cross-boder fire, according to Turkish sources.\n\nThe Observatory put the number of pro-Turkish Syrian forces killed in the offensive at 86.\n\nAn internal document circulated by the Kurdish administration on Monday, a copy of which was obtained by AFP, stressed the deal with Damascus was purely of a military nature and did not affect the work of the semi-autonomous institutions.\n\nBut the de-facto statelet the Kurdish administration had set up in northeastern has fast unravelled in recent days, with its forces losing control of a 120-kilometre-long segment of the border.\n\nThe area that is now under the control of Turkey and its proxies is ethnically Arab-dominated and some residents welcomed Turkish-backed forces.\n\n\u2013 Betrayal \u2013\n\nKurdish officials and residents alike in northeastern Syria have expressed outrage at what they call a US betrayal that shortchanges the sacrifices made in the fight against IS.\n\nSince 2014, the SDF have been the US-led anti-IS coalition\u2019s main partner on the ground in Syria, spearheading some key battles on the way to eliminating the jihadists\u2019 self-proclaimed \u201ccaliphate\u201d earlier this year.\n\nTrump already said last year he intended to pull US troops of Syria out but on Sunday the Pentagon announced he had ordered the withdrawal of 1,000 troops \u2014 almost the entire ground force \u2014 from the country\u2019s north.\n\n\u201cThe United States has lost its defeat mechanism against the Islamic State,\u201d the Institute for the Study of War wrote in a brief.\n\n\u201cIt took years for the US to realise that the SDF were the only capable partners. They will not partner with us again,\u201d it said.\n\nFrance and other countries have voiced deep concern over the risk that the Turkish invasion would break out detained IS fighters, scattering them across the region and possibly beyond.\n\nThat fear was validated Sunday when Kurdish authorities said Turkish shelling near a camp holding hundreds of these foreign fighters\u2019 relatives \u2014 including often very radicalised women \u2014 led to a mass breakout.", "description": "Tall Tamr (Syria) (AFP) \u2013 The Syrian regime sent troops towards the Turkish border on Monday to contain Ankara\u2019s deadly offensive against the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/f9e913_syrian-regime-soldier-waves-national-flag-in-town-tal-tamr-as-damascus-deploys-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
