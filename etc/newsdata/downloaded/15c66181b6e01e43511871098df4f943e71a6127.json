The text of the statute specifies that \u201c[n]one of the funds appropriated under this title shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the Trump administration\u2019s rule removes a requirement that Title X projects must refer for abortion and instead explicitly prohibits abortion referrals.\n\nThe rule permits nondirective pregnancy counseling, which can include nondirective counseling on abortion. But unlike earlier regulations, such counseling is permitted rather than required. These changes will allow additional organizations who object to abortion to still apply for Title X grants.\n\nThe rule also establishes that program participants must maintain both financial and physical separation between Title X activities and non-Title X activities. In other words, organizations like Planned Parenthood can\u2019t conduct Title X activity in one room while performing non-Title X-related abortions in another room down the hall.\n\nThe rule also protects women and children by requiring compliance with state reporting laws regarding human trafficking, coercive sexual activity, child abuse, rape, incest, and other crimes.\n\nA similar rule was enacted by President Ronald Reagan in 1988 and was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1991.\n\nFrom the moment the regulations were initially proposed, Planned Parenthood and its pro-abortion allies have emphatically opposed the provisions to enforce the statutory requirement to separate abortion from family planning services, and challenged the regulations in court.\n\nIn the face of judicial defeat, Planned Parenthood will forgo approximately $60 million in annual Title X funds.\n\nTo be clear, Title X grant recipients\u2014including Planned Parenthood\u2014do not have a right to federal funding and are welcome to decline to participate in Title X if they are unwilling to comply with the program\u2019s regulations.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has determined that its commitment to abortion outweighs its desire to participate in the program. That\u2019s a call it can afford to make: The abortion giant reported $245 million in excess revenue and more than $630 million in private contributions in its most recent annual report.\n\nBut this won\u2019t change things for women benefiting from other health centers. When Planned Parenthood pulls out of the program, other health centers that far outnumber Planned Parenthood facilities will continue offering women comprehensive and high-quality care.", "description": "Planned Parenthood is making good on its threat to choose abortion over Title X funds.\u00a0\n\nTitle X is a federal program that focuses on providing family planning and related preventive services to low-income Americans at little or no cost.", "authors": ["Melanie Israel", "Research Associate", "Melanie Is A Research Associate In The Devos Center For Religion", "Civil Society At The Heritage Foundation."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-08/GettyImages-681874932.jpg?itok=Gg2cA9ej"}
