(Oct. 21) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump said Wednesday that a wall is being built in Colorado.\n\n\"And we're building a wall on the border of New Mexico. And we\u2019re building a wall in Colorado. We\u2019re building a beautiful wall. A big one that really works \u2014 that you can\u2019t get over, you can\u2019t get under,\u201d Trump said during a speech at the Shale Insight Conference in Pittsburgh.\n\nHe continued, \u201cAnd we\u2019re building a wall in Texas. And we\u2019re not building a wall in Kansas but they get the benefit of the walls that we just mentioned. And Louisiana's incredible.\u201d\n\nColorado is not positioned along the U.S. southern border, where Trump has focused his desire for a physical barrier, and there have been no reports of plans to construct a border wall in the state. A portion of the border wall is being built along the Colorado River in Arizona.\n\nWhile it was presumed Trump simply misspoke, the president tweeted that he was \"kiddingly\" talking about a wall in Colorado, adding that he was speaking to \"people in the very packed auditorium, from Colorado & Kansas, getting the benefit of the Border Wall!\"\n\n(Kiddingly) We\u2019re building a Wall in Colorado\u201d(then stated, \u201cwe\u2019re not building a Wall in Kansas but they get the benefit of the Wall we\u2019re building on the Border\u201d) refered to people in the very packed auditorium, from Colorado & Kansas, getting the benefit of the Border Wall! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 24, 2019\n\nNevertheless, Trump\u2019s comments spread on Twitter.\n\nHey @TeamHeinrich & @tomudall\n\ndo one of you want to break it to @realDonaldTrump that Colorado's border is with New Mexico, not Mexico...or should I? https://t.co/8Qqe59Oep4 \u2014 John Hickenlooper (@Hickenlooper) October 23, 2019\n\nWe can confidently say that Mexico is never going to pay for a wall with Colorado. https://t.co/Jwniln1HFT \u2014 George Conway (@gtconway3d) October 23, 2019\n\nIs NEW Mexico gonna pay for it? https://t.co/DoSNGfsB9C \u2014 Rep. Diana DeGette (@RepDianaDeGette) October 23, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s border wall promise was a main campaign slogan from 2016, and the president recently said his administration will redirect $3.6 billion in Pentagon money to step up construction on the barrier.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/23/trump-declares-were-building-wall-colorado/4077890002/", "description": "Colorado is not positioned along the U.S.\u00a0southern border, where President Donald Trump has focused his desire for a physical barrier.", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
