Yeah, kids, City Hall is COOL. The place to go!\u201d\n\nOf course, it\u2019s possible the two were there to get paperwork ahead of an official wedding planned for next month. HuffPost reached out to the couple\u2019s representatives for a request for comment.\n\nThe Oscar-winner and the New York art dealer first sparked dating rumors in the spring of 2018, after she split from director Darren Aronofsky.\n\nHer friend Laura Simpson reportedly set her up with Maroney, a director at Gladstone Gallery, who Lawrence has described as the \u201cgreatest person\u201d she\u2019s ever met.

We wanted to marry each other, we wanted to commit fully.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s my best friend. I want to legally bind him to me forever,\u201d she quipped. \u201cAnd fortunately the paperwork exists for such a thing.
