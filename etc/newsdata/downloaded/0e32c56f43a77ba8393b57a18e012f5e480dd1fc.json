He said he had thought she was buying it to poison rats.\n\nSuspicions\n\nThe case only came to light after Rojo Thomas - the brother of her first husband Roy Thomas, who died in 2011 - raised concerns with officials two months ago.\n\nMrs Shaju's first alleged victim was her mother-in-law, Annamma Thomas, who is said to have died after eating a meal prepared by her in 2002.\n\nSix years later, Tom Thomas - Mrs Shaju's 66-year-old father-in-law - died under similar circumstances.\n\nThis was followed by the death of Roy in 2011. On this occasion, a post-mortem found traces of cyanide; however, it was not pursued.\n\nIn 2014, Annamma's brother Matthew insisted a second post-mortem be carried out on his nephew. He died the same year, PTI said.\n\nThe family became more worried in 2016, around the time of the death of their cousin Scaria Shaju's wife. Her young daughter, Alfine, had died two years earlier.\n\nThe suspect went on to marry Mr Shaju.\n\nPolice allege Mrs Shaju, who they say confessed to all six killings, was motivated by money. Her sister-in-law Renji said she had taken control of the family finances after her mother's death. Her father, she said, considered her the model daughter-in-law.\n\n\"I used to consider Jolly as my elder sister,\" Renji told PTI. \"I used to like her. She used to behave in a friendly manner with everyone.\"\n\nPolice investigations are ongoing.", "description": "Jolly Shaju is alleged to have poisoned six relatives to death with cyanide over 14 years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B0C0/production/_109184254_61c16f5c-e2fc-4b9d-9579-bd046b94cbe3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
