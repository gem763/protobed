Cory Booker (N.J.) speaks about gun violence at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., in August. (Randall Hill/Reuters)\n\nIn recent weeks, presidential candidates on the left have made it known that they aren\u2019t afraid to invoke God on a range of topics.\n\n\u201cIf you believe that God is watching as poison is being belched into the air of creation and people are being harmed by it, countries are at risk of vanishing in low-lying areas, what do you suppose God thinks of that?\u201d South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg asked during Wednesday\u2019s CNN climate change forum. He added: \u201cAt least one way of talking about this is that it\u2019s a kind of sin.\u201d\n\n\u201cStay faithful,\u201d Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) told the crowd at a church in Tulsa about fighting racism. \u201cWe have come this far by faith, and we will keep going.\u201d\n\nHere are Sen. @CoryBooker\u2019s closing remarks today at Tulsa\u2019s historic Vernon Chapel AME Church.\n\n\n\n\u201cStay faithful,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have come this far by faith, and we will keep going.\u201d\n\n\n\nMore, including Booker\u2019s full speech, here: https://t.co/qepiPFGHCQ pic.twitter.com/Ls8YxMijU1 \u2014 Tulsa's Channel 8 (@KTULNews) August 29, 2019\n\n\u201cPrayers for the people of the Bahamas, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas,\u201d tweeted author Marianne Williamson. \u201cMay the peace of God be upon them and their hearts be comforted as they endure the storm.\u201d\n\nContrast that with how Robert Jeffress, a Dallas pastor who advises President Trump on issues of faith, described the Democratic Party last month on Fox Business.\n\nThey are a godless party, Lou, and becoming more so. You remember back in 2012, when they had an argument on national television at their convention about removing God from their platform? Then, in 2016, at their convention, they had a pastor up there praying, and he gets heckled, and now, even this weekend, the Democrat Party passes a resolution saying \u2018we enthusiastically support the values of the religiously unaffiliated in America.\u2019 'Religiously unaffiliated\u2019 is code for godless! They are truly becoming a godless party by their outreach, and certainly by their beliefs.\n\nIt is a criticism frequently directed at liberals by the religious right. In May, Vice President Pence told Liberty University graduates to be prepared to be attacked by \u201cHollywood liberals,\u201d the media and the \u201csecular left\u201d for their Christian faith.\n\n\u201cSome of the loudest voices for tolerance today have little tolerance for traditional Christian beliefs,\u201d Pence said. \u201cAs you go about your daily life, just be ready, because you\u2019re going to be asked not just to tolerate things that violate your faith, you\u2019re going to be asked to endorse them. You\u2019re going to be asked to bow down to the idols of the popular culture.\u201d\n\nBut the assertion that Democrats as a whole are godless doesn\u2019t make much sense. If that were true, the people vying to be their standard-bearer wouldn\u2019t be frequently and publicly invoking a higher power. So which is correct? There\u2019s some misrepresentation going on here, but there are also reasons the \u201cgodless\u201d label proves effective when it comes to whipping up opposition to Democrats.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at the numbers. The data shows that belief in God and identification with a religion is actually pretty common in both parties.\n\nMost Democrats \u2014 76 percent \u2014 are absolutely certain or fairly certain about their belief in God, according to a 2018 study conducted by the Pew Research Center. That\u2019s not a small number, although it is lower than the percentage \u2014 90 percent \u2014 of Republicans who say they are absolutely certain or fairly certain about their belief in God.\n\nMore than 80 percent of Republicans and right-leaning voters said religion is very important or somewhat important in their lives, according to Pew. But so do a large majority \u2014 more than 70 percent \u2014 of Democrats and left-leaning voters.\n\nBut it is the subject of the religiously unaffiliated that has attracted widespread attention recently.\n\nMost people \u2014 54 percent \u2014 who identify as religiously unaffiliated identify as Democrats or left-leaning, according to Pew. About a quarter of the group claim to be Republicans or right-leaning.\n\nPew stated: \u201cIn the U.S., belief in a deity is common even among the religiously unaffiliated \u2014 a group composed of those who identify themselves, religiously, as atheist, agnostic or \u2018nothing in particular,\u2019 and sometimes referred to, collectively, as religious \u2018nones.\u2019 Indeed, nearly three-quarters of religious \u2018nones\u2019 (72%) believe in a higher power of some kind, even if not in God as described in the Bible.\u201d\n\nThose who identify as \u201creligiously unaffiliated\u201d make up a larger share of the population than the number of Democrats who identify as Catholic, evangelical Protestant, mainline Protestant or adherents of the historically black Protestant tradition.\n\nAs Pew said, it\u2019s not safe to assume that all those in the religiously unaffiliated category don\u2019t believe in God. But it\u2019s certainly a sizable enough share \u2014 13 percent \u2014 to help shape how the Democratic Party determines its values.\n\nAnd that is tied to the resolution Jeffress spoke of as proof of Democrats\u2019 godlessness.\n\nWhy did Democrats approve a resolution on \u2018the religiously unaffiliated'? At its summer meeting last month, the Democratic National Committee passed a measure showing support for the values of the religiously unaffiliated \u2014 including Americans who are atheist, agnostic or mark \u201cnone\u201d on surveys \u2014 and acknowledging the growth of that group in the party. As it has grown, party leaders felt the need to make sure that those individuals\u2019 values were considered when shaping policy.\n\nThe measure also represented a response to what secular liberals have described as mistreatment, based on values and worldviews, by people of faith in a largely religious country. It stated that \u201creligiously unaffiliated Americans are a group that, as much as any other, advocates for rational public policy based on sound science and universal humanistic values and should be represented, included, and heard by the Party.\u201d\n\nThe resolution, which received quite a bit of pushback from social conservatives and some religious Democrats, also described the Democratic Party as \u201can inclusive organization that recognizes that morals, values, and patriotism are not unique to any particular religion, and are not necessarily reliant on having a religious worldview at all.\u201d\n\nMichael Wear, Obama\u2019s 2012 faith outreach director, criticized the resolution and said it could make things more difficult for the left in 2020.\n\n\u201cI just want to be clear,\u201d he tweeted after the measure passed. \u201cThis is both politically stupid, but also, just stupid on a fundamental level that transcends electoral politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump is absolutely going to run this into the ground, and not just with white evangelicals,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump is absolutely going to run this into the ground, and not just with white evangelicals. \u2014 Michael Wear (@MichaelRWear) August 30, 2019\n\nWhy the label sticks and is weaponized\n\nJeffress was speaking more broadly, though, with his charge that Democrats are \u201ca godless party by their outreach, and certainly by their beliefs.\u201d\n\nEven some Democrats think some of the loudest voices on the left are detrimental to courting people of faith. Before posting the tweet we noted above, Marianne Williamson was the subject of a flurry of mockery for having tweeted to her followers to use the \u201cpower of the mind\u201d to turn away Hurricane Dorian.\n\nThis was the tweet: pic.twitter.com/6VXhdO8Avk \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) September 4, 2019\n\nPlenty of Twitter users rushed to her defense, but Williamson wound up deleting the tweet. She took the criticism as evidence that many of her critics don\u2019t understand prayer the way religious Americans do. She told The Washington Post\u2019s Jacqueline Alemany:\n\nPeople don\u2019t like to feel that their values are invalidated and people can feel when they\u2019re being condescended to . . . I was in South Carolina last weekend and Georgia. And you better believe that there were people there praying that the hurricane would turn around \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re stupid. That doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t believe in science or climate change. The fact that you pray, the fact that you visualize, the fact that you meditate, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re stupid, or ignorant or uninformed. . . . There had been many within the Democratic Party who have tilted in a strangely, what I perceive to be, an overly secularized conversation.\n\nThere\u2019s a strand of argument on the left that one of the reasons Democrats lost the 2016 election is because Hillary Clinton made significantly less effort than Barack Obama had to connect with conservative Christian voters. Another frequent complaint is that too few people in leadership positions in the Democratic Party have a basic grasp of the contemporary religious landscape. Describing the religiously unaffiliated, a notably diverse bloc, as \u201cthe largest religious group in the Democratic Party\u201d confirms that.\n\nThe rap that Democrats aren\u2019t God-friendly certainly has resonance on the right. Republicans largely overestimate the percentage of liberals who do not believe in God, according to a 2017 study titled \u201cThe Parties in our Heads: Misperceptions About Party Composition and Their Consequences\u201d by independent scholar Gaurav Sood and Douglas Ahler, a political science professor at Florida State University.\n\nAccording to the YouGov data featured in the study, Republicans estimate 36 percent of Democrats are atheist or agnostic. The actual amount is 9 percent.\n\nDemocrats are certainly wrestling with demographic shifts within their party on multiple fronts, including religion. But the religious, including those identifying as Christian, are still a major force in the party, and one that no one seeking the White House thinks they can afford to alienate.", "description": "The data shows that faith is pretty prevalent for Democrats.", "authors": ["Eugene Scott", "Reporter Covering Identity Politics For The Fix", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/n8udRA0B9b0cUKTS1i4jGbDwbI8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5BJHG7V64II6TKFQP3MKBVO4LU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
