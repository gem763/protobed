'I worry about putting the best possible show together every Sunday night.'\n\n'There are very few programs on Australian TV who can say that their numbers are up,' Lisa added.\n\nAccording to New Idea, Lisa is believed to be asking for a million dollar figure in order to re-sign with the network next year.\n\nNot worried: Lisa addressed the ratings drop and her critics in an interview with The Daily Telegraph in November last year, saying she 'cannot worry about that'. Pictured in October\n\nThe journalist reportedly asked for a $2million, two-year deal before jetting off to Italy with her husband Peter FitzSimons in July.\n\nTV Blackbox editor Rob McKnight told the magazine that Lisa would be a worthwhile investment for the struggling network.\n\nWhile she hasn't delivered blockbuster ratings for The Project, she 'has respect' in the industry and lands 'big-name interviews'.\n\nMcKnight added that it's likely Channel Ten will be eager to keep Lisa on board, due to the prestige she brings to the program.", "description": "Former Today co-host Lisa Wilkinson is rumoured to have secured a $2.3million salary when she jumped ship to Channel 10 two years ago.", "authors": ["Daily Mail Australia Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/08/20237628-0-image-a-16_1572166098372.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
