Though there have been encouraging shifts in the way that historically huge polluters like the food, auto, and fashion industries approach production, Silicon Valley has continued to operate with little regard for tech\u2019s wastefulness.\n\nThe environmental footprint of consumer tech, a $1.5 trillion industry, is staggering. Of the billion or so active iPhones in the world, according to Apple\u2019s latest earnings report, less than 1% are recycled. And that\u2019s just one product. Much of our disused gadgets eventually make it to developing countries, such as India and China, where sprawling dumps of electronic waste, known as e-waste, continue to grow ever higher.\n\nHelping reduce such waste is a key mission of Nimble, an eco-conscious electronics brand launched last year in southern California. The idea for Nimble was seeded for its founders during a walk through the aisles of the Consumer Electronics Show, a massive trade show in Las Vegas, in 2017, and not finding a single \u201ctruly mission driven brand,\u201d according to co-founder Ross Howe. \u201cNo one in the space was talking about the impact that technology was having on the environment,\u201d he says. Co-founder Kevin Malinowski adds, \u201cIt\u2019s a dirty secret that gets brushed under the rug and ignored.\u201d\n\nWith the advent of do-good, direct-to-consumer brands like Toms, Allbirds, and The Honest Company, the pair asked themselves, Why is tech not even talking about sustainability when every other industry is talking about it?\n\nIn launching an electronics company, the Nimble team was not starting from scratch. The three founders\u2014Howe, Malinowski, and Jon Bradley \u2014had all been on the founding team of Mofie, a company specializing in wireless phone chargers. In five years, Howie says, they grew the company to $350 million in revenue before selling it to the online electronics retailer Zag in 2016.\n\nNow, two years later, using recycled materials made in Chinese factories that are heavily vetted for eco- and labor-friendly practices, Nimble is quickly gaining steam as a provider of not just green electronics, but high-quality ones as well. \u201cNimble\u2019s stuff is actually very, very nice,\u201d judged Wired magazine.\n\nITEM\n\nNimble has four product categories: portable chargers, wireless chargers, fast charge kits, and its newest, phone cases. The brand\u2019s chargers, which include 10k, 13k, 20k, and 26k mAh models, are sleek, fashionable items, made with plant-based bioplastic, wholly recycled aluminum, and hemp-based fabric, with specks of mica doppling the dock. The phone cases\u2014for iPhones 11, X, XS, XS Max and XR\u2014are offered in a multitude of colors, with a soft yet grippy texture; they are made 100% from plastic bottles. Nimble\u2019s wireless chargers, which consist of a rounded square pad covered in soft fabric, work speedily, and even charge through cases.\n\nNimble's phone cases are made 100% from plastic bottles. Nimble\n\nPRICE\n\nWhile more expensive than budget competitors, Nimble is priced fairly competitively compared to legacy brands. The wireless chargers go for between $40 and $60 while the portable ones go for between $50 and $100. The phone cases cost around $40. Though its founders intend to eventually move into retail stores, Nimble\u2019s products are now only available online.\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE GOOD?\n\nBeyond employing nearly 100% sustainable and recycled materials in its production, Nimble also provides, in each package, a baggy in which consumers may deposit some of their own e-waste. Print out a free shipping form from Nimble\u2019s website and send the baggy back, and up to a pound of e-waste is recycled through Homeboy Industries in Los Angeles, a non-profit that employs mostly former convicts.\n\nTo solidify its eco-cred, Nimble has undergone the rigorous assessment process provided by Certified B-Corp, a watchdog group.\n\nNimble is also a member of One Percent for the Planet, which confirms that the company funnels 1% of its revenues back into environmental initiatives. They also take care to green-ify its packaging, ensuring that each component\u2014from the recycled (recyclable) scrap paper box to the soy-based ink\u2014is eco-friendly. (Big Tech, with all its metallic finishing and plastic wrap, is notorious for its wasteful packaging.) \u201cIf you think of who has the shiniest boxes, it\u2019s always the tech industry,\u201d Howe grumbles.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n\nUltimately, Nimble aims to \u201cexpand into as many product categories as possible,\u201d Howe says. \u201cWe really want to become a personal tech brand.\u201d\n\nThere are new products coming, though Howe and Malinowski are tight-lipped on exactly what. Above all, Malinowski adds, they hope that Nimble will inspire other companies \u201cto follow suit\u201d and stop being so wasteful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to fathom the scale in which we are dumping these poisonous products in landfills,\u201d Malinowski says. \u201cOur goal is to have Nimble not be so remarkable in the tech space.\u201d", "description": "The California-based brand creates chargers and phone cases using nearly 100% sustainable and recycled materials", "authors": ["Brent Crane"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-120282/social", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
