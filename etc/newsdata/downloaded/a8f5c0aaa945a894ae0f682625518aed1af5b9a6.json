I just get the message 'unregistered network'. Been like that since early this morning. Time is now 1038 am\".\n\nAnother said: \"I don't want to see anymore adverts about 5G in London when I'm struggling to get 4G #threedown #ThreeUK #Threemoblie #Threenetwork.\"\n\nOn Twitter , a Three spokesperson tweeted that the network is experiencing technical difficulties - however could not say when the outage will be fixed.\n\n\"We\u2019re currently experiencing technical difficulties with voice, text and data, meaning some of you will be experiencing intermittent service. please accept our apologies, we\u2019re sorting this out right now. check back here for updates.\"\n\nIn the interim - here are you rights to money back during and after the outage.\n\nThree down - your refund rights\n\n(Image: Bloomberg)\n\nDepending on the circumstances, it may be appropriate for your provider to offer you some money back while repairs are being carried out - especially if you're still without service.\n\nYou can raise this with Three over the phone, online chat or on social media now, though be aware lines will be extremely busy as the service gets back up and running.\n\nIn more extreme cases, where repairs take much longer (for example it takes longer than usual to access a mast site to undertake repairs), you may be entitled to an additional refund or account credit.\n\nIn cases such as this, where you have been without service for some time, you may also have the right to leave the contract without penalty. There may be a term in your contract saying you can do this if your provider has failed in its obligations to you or breached a key condition.\n\nFurthermore, if you're forced to incur any extra charges because of the outage, such as having to pay for public wifi, you can complain to your provider and ask for compensation to cover those unexpected expenses. Keep all evidence including receipts and emails for this as you will have to prove the expenses in your claim.\n\nFinally, Three customers are paying for a service that they rightly expect to receive. If they don't deliver, you are well within your rights to ask for the money back covering the hours affected. This would most likely be your monthly bill divided by the month and multiplied by the number of hours affected. Three will most likely have a threshold in place for pay-as-you-go customers.\n\nHow to complain and claim money back\n\n(Image: NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nIf your provider fails to repair a fault by the date promised, or you are unhappy with how long it is taking, you should follow their internal complaints procedure. You can get in touch with Three here, although it's worth waiting for the service to be back up and running, first.\n\nIf you raise a case but it's still unresolved, or solved without good reason, you can submit your complaint to an independent Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) scheme after eight weeks.\n\nIf your problem cannot be resolved, ask your provider for a \u2018deadlock\u2019 letter so that you can refer your dispute to the relevant ADR scheme directly before the eight week mark.\n\nOfcom has approved two ADR schemes - CISAS and Ombudsman Services: Communications.\n\nIs Three down in my area?\n\nLarge parts of the UK are without service this morning - including in London, Manchester and Birmingham.\n\nKeep an eye on Three status updates in our guide, here.", "description": "According to DownDetector, the issues started at around 23:32 BST on Wednesday night, and have continued on into Thursday morning", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "This Content Is Subject To Copyright.", "Bloomberg", "Nurphoto Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12030028.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/THP_CHP_150218SLUG_823JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
