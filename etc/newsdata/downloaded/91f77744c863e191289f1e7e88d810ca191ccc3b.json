Prices have declined to a low near $110 and are now showing signs that we could see an improvement into year end.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of CAT, below, we can see a sideways to lower trading range market for CAT the past 12 months. The price action and indicators started to show a change from June. Prices made a low in early June and a lower low in late August.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line did not make a matching lower low in August and actually made a higher low creating a bullish divergence.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator made equal lows in June and August despite prices making lower lows. This indicator is now crossing above the zero line for an outright go long signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of CAT, below, we can see the stock's long decline but we can also see some subtle improvement.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is up from its late 2018 low. Prices are testing the bottoming 40-week moving average line and the weekly MACD oscillator is moving back towards the underside of the zero line. Not table pounding bullish but certainly not bearish.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of CAT, below, we can see that the software is projecting an upside price target around $178.\n\nBottom line strategy: CAT is looking better so patient investors could go long CAT at current levels risking a close below $120 for now. $177 is our upside price target.", "description": "Let's check the charts of this global leader in the&nbsp;manufacture of construction and mining equipment....CAT", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Is Caterpillar'S Long Decline Coming To An End", "Let'S Check The Charts Of This Global Leader In The Manufacture Of Construction", "Mining Equipment.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "Eric Jhonsa", "Timothy Collins", "Bob Lang", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/2327d1f8-ae11-11e9-ad16-f515a7d6abd6.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
