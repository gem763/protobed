He offered no evidence to back up his claims.\n\nDuring a press conference Tuesday, Meta reportedly said: \u201cI do have some words about honored billionaire George Soros. I failed to listen carefully to [Hungarian Prime Minister] Viktor Orban in January 2000, when I was speaking with love about George Soros because truth be told, he helped us when we were in opposition, and [Orban] told me: \u2018Be aware because he is not that democratic and often conspires against democracy.\u201d\n\nLEFT-WING BILLIONAIRE GEORGE SOROS SCORES WINS IN VIRGINIA ELECTIONS, AS OPPONENTS SAY RACE WAS 'BOUGHT'\n\nHe also lashed out at the international community \u2013 including the U.S. and the European Union - calling on diplomats \u201cto not become ridiculous and not play with our constitution\u201d, according to Italian news agency Ansa.\n\nMeta had previously tried to cancel Sunday\u2019s elections, saying they would be undemocratic without the participation of Albania's opposition, which boycotted the vote.\n\nBut Prime Minister Edi Rama of the ruling Socialist Party ordered the elections for mayors and local council members held Sunday, and his party is expected to receive the most votes by a significant margin. Preliminary results were expected Tuesday but were delayed.\n\nThe opposition has claimed that the low turnout \u2014 21.6 percent \u2014 showed that Sunday's elections were unconstitutional and illegal. International observers said the lack of opposition participation meant that the vote was held \u201cwith little regard for the interests of the electorate\u201d.\n\nGEORGE SOROS SAYS EUROPE FACES 'OBLIVION' AS RIGHT-WING PARTIES SET TO WIN BIG IN EUROPEAN ELECTION\n\nMeta has proposed new municipal and early general elections in October, but it is unlikely to be accepted by the Socialists.\n\nMeta was elected president in 2017, but the Albanian parliament, which is controlled by the Socialists, has put him under investigation and is seeking to oust him.\n\nOpposition center-right lawmakers relinquished their seats in parliament and have led protests since mid-February, accusing the government of corruption and vote-rigging in previous elections. Rama and his party deny the allegations.\n\nHungarian-American financier Soros is a regular target of some right-wing circles thanks to his funding of left-wing causes across Europe and the U.S.\n\nHungary\u2019s nationalist government last year passed a \u201cStop Soros\u201d package to curtail his activities via his Open Society Foundations \u2013 including a measure making it illegal for non-governmental organizations to organize illegal immigration into the country.\n\nFox News' Adam Shaw and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The president of Albania on Tuesday denounced municipal elections that took place on Sunday as a \u201cfarce\u201d, accusing left-wing billionaire philanthropist George Soros of being involved in a \u201cconspiracy\u201d", "authors": ["Chris Irvine", "Chris Irvine Is Senior News Editor At Fox News.
