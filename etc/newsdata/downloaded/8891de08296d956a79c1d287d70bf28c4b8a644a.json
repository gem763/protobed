That should also help ease some pressure on net interest margins in the upcoming round of results, beginning with ANZ on Thursday.\n\n\"There is no funding impost on the banks at the moment,\" agreed ST Wong, chief investment officer at Prime Value Asset Management. \"Markets are reasonably efficient. There is no drying up of liquidity.\"\n\nBut forcing funding costs down in Australia through the Reserve Bank buying bank bonds or offering lenders direct loans may not be a long-term positive for the sector.\n\nPrasad Patkar, fund manager at Platypus Asset Management, compared Treasury's suggestions with the European Central Bank's 2011 LTRO programme.\n\nThe ECB hasn't been able to rein-in its ultra-low interest rates or its bond buying in a significant way, and European lenders are still struggling to generate an attractive level of profits and build capital.\n\n\"Unconventional methods have side effects as we have seen in other economies and one of them is a weaker banking sector profitability,\" said Mr Patkar.\n\nEconomists that took part in The Australian Financial Review's September quarterly survey believe that quantitative easing could start next year as official cash rates continue to fall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree cuts so far this year have taken the official cash rate to 0.75 per cent, but inflation remains stubbornly below target and the unemployment rate remains above the 4.5 per cent that the RBA is unofficially targeting.\n\n\"Unconventional policy is more likely than not,\" said Andrew Ticehurst, head of fixed income strategy for Australia at Nomura.\n\nUnconventional policy likely\n\nNomura is assigning a 60 per cent chance of unconventional policy being deployed in Australia, as the Reserve Bank struggles to achieve its inflation and unemployment objectives.\n\nAny kind of unconventional policy would need to include a broad range of assets, he said, such as mortgage-backed bonds.\n\nFor a policy designed to lower funding costs to succeed, it would have to be a direct funding mechanism, said Prime Value's Mr Wong. \"The RBA could say that funding could only go to housing for example,\" he said.\n\nHowever, cheap funding aimed at the housing market risks further inflating house prices, which have already started to lift since the Reserve Bank's June rate cut.\n\nThe Prime Value fund manager argued that it isn't the cost of funding that has restrained loan growth, but the banks and the prudential regulator. \"The banks have tightened and that is squeezing the flow-through of credit,\" he said.\n\nThe optics of the Reserve Bank providing the banking sector with cheap funds when it has already been roundly criticised for not passing through the full extent of rate cuts to the consumer could be difficult to manage.\n\n\"If the banks were to benefit from this mechanism I think there would be an uproar,\" said Mr Wong. \"I don't think that the banks are on their knees,\" the fund manager added, citing positive loan growth, net interest margins above 100 basis points, and their ability to remain highly profitable.", "description": "Lowering funding costs may help the banks in the short term, but could prove problematic if this translates to ongoing unconventional monetary policy conditions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8011%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_126/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d000537d19be553845bb7f7b15fd3968149d13e6", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
