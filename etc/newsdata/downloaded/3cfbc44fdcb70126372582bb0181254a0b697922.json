We hear far less about those that are a pain to prep, a nightmare to cook with or difficult to arrange on the plate. To put that right, G2 spoke to a variety of chefs who talked of soapy herbs, dangerous shellfish and the ingredients they have come to hate.\n\nGlobe artichoke\n\n\n\nGlobe artichokes look interesting and beautiful, but they over-promise. It\u2019s the amount of effort for the lack of benefit. The French like to nibble the outer leaves, but you have to put them in iced lemon-water as you peel them off or they go a cacky-brown. And some of the leaves you can eat and some you can\u2019t, which I find faffy. You then have to hack off the bottom of the globe artichoke and the stem, and scoop out the fluffy, fibrous choke (if you eat it, it sticks in your throat and chokes you), until you get to this really small artichoke heart \u2013 which is fresh and most definitely a vegetable, but hardly packed full of personality or flavour. For a domestic cook, spending 15 minutes on one might be entertaining, but if you\u2019re prepping double or triple digits of them, it\u2019s pointless. You can buy artichoke hearts pre-prepared and they don\u2019t lose any flavour.\n\nLiz Cottam, chef and co-owner, Home, Leeds\n\nOkra\n\n\n\nOkra is the most foul thing ever grown. When fusion food became a thing in London, chefs started using every ingredient on the planet and, if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing with okra, it goes really slimy \u2013 and tastes bitter, too. The only time it\u2019s near-edible is when you deep-fry the hell out of it. But anything works deep-fried; what\u2019s the point? I refuse to work with it. If I see it in a dish, I ask for it to be removed.\n\nJason Atherton, chef-proprietor, the Social Company restaurants\n\nCrayfish\n\n\n\nWhen I was about 12, I worked as a kitchen porter in a local golf club \u2013 I lied about my age \u2013 and I\u2019d spend eight hours shelling crayfish. It\u2019s the worst job known to man. While delicious, there\u2019s not much meat in them, so you\u2019re doing 200 for service. It\u2019s tedious and the shells are very sharp. If you\u2019ve not got double gloves on, you\u2019re constantly slicing your fingers open. You end up with blue plasters everywhere, and every time you stick your hands into the salt during service you\u2019re reminded why.\n\nSam Grainger, executive chef, Belzan, Liverpool\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Asafoetida \u2026 can cause bitterness in dishes \u2013 and chefs. Photograph: bdspn/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nAsafoetida\n\n\n\nBarely a pinch of asafoetida will flavour any dal or curry, but even a milligram more can add a bitterness that ruins everything. It doesn\u2019t help that every time you buy it, it\u2019s a little different, more or less pungent, so there\u2019s no way to test it other than throwing it in and seeing what happens.\n\nDhruv Mittal, chef-owner, DUM Biryani, London\n\nCoconut\n\n\n\nCoconut milk in a curry I can deal with, but I can\u2019t understand why anyone eats flavourless, sawdust-like desiccated coconut \u2013 or fresh coconut, for that matter. Chefs have to risk their limbs to smash open this big, horrible, hairy nut, and it\u2019s not like the flesh is softly juicy. It\u2019s watery, rock hard and brittle and gets stuck in your teeth. If I was on a desert island, I\u2019d starve.\n\nTommy Banks, chef-owner, the Black Swan, Oldstead\n\nRaw turmeric root\n\n\n\nYou know the yellow stain on your kitchen counter when you spill curry? That\u2019s what a few grams of dried turmeric powder does to plastic. Imagine your hands after peeling 5kg of raw turmeric root, as I did every day when I worked in Madras. You wash and wash, but the yellow is still there. Good for the stomach, flavour and health. Not good for family photos.\n\nGouranga Bera, head chef, Curry Leaf Caf\u00e9, Brighton\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Turbot \u2013 \u2018The mucus is absolutely disgusting.\u2019 Photograph: niolox/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nTurbot\n\n\n\nThe thing I struggle most with is the \u201csnot\u201d you get on turbot. The skin exudes mucus that, when it sits for a little while, turns green, like someone has sneezed on the turbot. After boning-out pigs\u2019 heads, it is the most stomach-churning job. I battle through and prep it \u2013 I love turbot \u2013 but that mucus is absolutely disgusting.\n\nMary-Ellen McTague, chef-owner, the Creameries, Manchester\n\nTruffle oil\n\n\n\nKids will get a bottle of cheap truffle oil \u2013 that very pungent fake rubbish; the nearest it\u2019s come to a truffle is probably a chocolate truffle in the supermarket \u2013 dress a risotto with it and the whole flavour is ruined. They think they\u2019re giving the guest luxury because it\u2019s truffle oil, but because of its overexaggerated chemical flavour, it just ruins your palate. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we use brilliant truffle oil, but guess what? You pay for it.\n\nSat Bains, chef-owner, Restaurant Sat Bains, Nottingham\n\nWild garlic capers\n\n\n\nI love wild garlic capers, but I hate preparing them. Early wild garlic season is lovely, picking the flowers and leaves, which are quite easy to cook with, but once the flower has gone you get the [caper-like] seedpods coming, 10 or 20 to each stem, and we have to process about 30 kilos to last us until next year. Picking off the pods takes days, your hands start turning brown and everything stinks of garlic. It\u2019s nice for half an hour, but a week later it\u2019s: \u201cWhy did we even start this?\u201d\n\nLuke French, chef-owner, J\u00f6ro, Sheffield\n\nCoriander\n\n\n\nCoriander lifts our Cali-Mex dishes, but it\u2019s so messy. It gets everywhere: stuck to knives, hands, chopping boards. You\u2019re finding it for days and, after all that, certain people complain it tastes like soap.\n\nMeriel Armitage, chef-owner, Club Mexicana, London\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Meadowsweet \u2026 \u2018No one cares if you were roaming fields at 5am picking it.\u2019 Photograph: Alexander_Pogudin/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nForaged food\n\n\n\nI hate this new-fangled foraging hype. There\u2019s a reason meadowsweet isn\u2019t a popular ingredient and that\u2019s because it\u2019s not nice \u2013 kind of floral, herbal and soapy. No one sits at home going: \u201cYou know what I fancy? Some meadowsweet parfait.\u201d No one cares if you were roaming fields at 5am picking it. The only thing anyone should be foraging is wild mushrooms. The rest? Go to a farmer.\n\nTom Brown, chef-owner, Cornerstone, London\n\nCracked black pepper\n\n\n\nI put peppercorns in braising dishes, soups and stocks because it\u2019s a slow-release flavour, like bay leaf. I love them in Jewish chicken soup and in Filipino food. But I cannot be having cracked black pepper. I hate it as a cooking ingredient, where chefs in pretend-French-bistros season beef fillet with it or it gets into a b\u00e9chamel. Then it\u2019s automatically added to cooked food, where its fiery flavour can easily ruin a dish if it\u2019s overused. The only thing you should put pepper on is eggs or steak, after cooking them.\n\nRachel Stockley, chef, Baratxuri, Ramsbottom\n\nFennel\n\n\n\nIn four years, we\u2019ve only used fennel once and that was a very small piece. Some say it\u2019s good with fish, but fish is delicate and fennel\u2019s full-on flavour simply overpowers everything on the plate. And it\u2019s a difficult vegetable to cook. The strong fibres can make it stringy. You have to braise it for a long time to get past that. Go too far and it can turn to mush.\n\nRichard Bainbridge, chef-owner, Benedicts, Norwich\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest No everyone is a sucker for Octopus. Photograph: Torresigner/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nOctopus\n\n\n\nI struggle with octopus, particularly cold. I don\u2019t find its gelatinous quality pleasant. I feel I should like it \u2013 but no.\n\nJane Baxter, co-owner, Wild Artichokes catering, Devon\n\nSmoked salmon\n\n\n\nSmoked salmon leaves a lingering smell that gets under the fingernails, hangs around far too long and is seemingly impenetrable to the affect of soap and hot water. I always wear gloves.\n\nJosh Katz, chef-founder, Berber & Q, London", "description": "From \u2018horrible\u2019 coconut to \u2018stomach-turning\u2019 turbot, top chefs reveal the foods they can\u2019t stand", "authors": ["Tony Naylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d0b55642f9bf5ae0f04a047b2add69f3aff52c0/0_7_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=884b80e123c21e4c4b331ed4489feebf", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
