These recommendations are usually risk/reward commodities meant to be used in large-field tournaments. Typically, blending these low-owned hidden gems with well-aligned staples contributes to a viable GPP strategy.\n\nKeep in mind that the following player write-ups were constructed earlier in the day, and sometimes injury/rest situations can alter the fantasy landscape. Monitoring our MLB News & Headlines Feed throughout the day will keep you in the loop while giving you the subsequent DFS consequences of each information piece.\n\nWe will be looking at the 11-game main slate beginning at 7:05 ET.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPITCHER\n\nEduardo Rodriguez - Boston (at Philadelphia)\n\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily the best matchup for Rodriguez, but that will likely reduce his ownership rate in large-field tournaments. Truth be told, the Phillies rank 19th in wRC+ this season, so there\u2019s room for E-Rod to maintain his hot streak of 44+ fantasy points in four of his past five starts. The lone miss came at Colorado, which is pretty understandable. His counterpart, Philadelphia RHP Aaron Nola, has looked somewhat shaky lately, so Rodriguez could be looking at a road victory to spark fantasy upside.\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nDaniel Vogelbach - Seattle (vs. Chicago White Sox)\n\nVogelbach hasn\u2019t done much from a fantasy point of view lately, but we can\u2019t dismiss the Seattle slugger. He still carries immense power upside, which could be on full display against White Sox RHP Dylan Cease\u2019s .394 wOBA split to left-handed bats. Cease has allowed 13 earned runs across 12 innings over his past three starts, and I\u2019m not afraid to target him with an all-out Seattle stack.\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nStory continues\n\nDee Gordon - Seattle (vs. Chicago White Sox)\n\nSpeaking to that Mariners\u2019 stack, don\u2019t forget about Gordon as a bargain lift at second base. Sure, he doesn\u2019t carry power upside like his teammates, but the speedster is a candidate for multiple hits, runs, and maybe a steal or two this evening. He\u2019ll look to jump on the aforementioned vulnerability of White Sox RHP Cease to provide a strong return on investment for fantasy backers.\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nRafael Devers - Boston (at Philadelphia)\n\nI briefly touched on this earlier, but Philadelphia RHP Nola has been shaky while allowing nine earned runs across 10 innings over his past two starts. If that continues, the Red Sox could represent a sneaky-good stack with a tiny ownership rate against the Phillies\u2019 ace. Devers is a strong lift within that while holding capable upside in the midst of a career season (.314, 29 HR, 107 RBI).\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nWilly Adames - Tampa Bay (at LA Angels)\n\nLet\u2019s jump back into the bargain bin to select Adames as an economical shortstop for tournaments. Trevor Story, Alex Bregman, and Francisco Lindor will get all the love at this position, but their marked-up salaries will likely keep you from finding upside at other positions. Adames represents a cheaper path without skimping on potential. The Tampa shortstop went 2-3 with a homer and three runs last night, and there\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll come back for more against Angels\u2019 RHP Jaime Barria\u2019s .371 wOBA split to right-handed bats.\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nAvisail Garcia - Tampa Bay (at LA Angels)\n\nTake the last ten or so words of the previous write-up, and directly apply it to Garcia. Yeah, I\u2019m talking about the part where I explain LAA RHP Barria\u2019s .371 wOBA split to right-handed bats. Tommy Pham, Adames, and Garcia are excellent candidates against that, and the latter finds himself in the midst of a hot streak with multiple hits in three of his past five.\n\nJ.D. Davis - NY Mets (vs. LA Dodgers)\n\nDodgers\u2019 LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu has been dominant for most of the season, but he found a rough-patch after allowing 17 earned runs across 13.1 innings over his past three starts. Those struggles could carry into tonight\u2019s road start against the Mets, and a capable hitter like Davis is in line to take advantage if that\u2019s the case. Davis has smacked five hits over his past three games, and I like him as a tournament choice this evening.", "description": "Spencer Limbach finds some sneaky-good MLB GPP Pivots away from the popular picks for Saturday, September 14.
