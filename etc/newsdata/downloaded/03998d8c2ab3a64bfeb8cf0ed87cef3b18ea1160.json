We\u2019ve done the steps that we needed to do properly, but the next step is that we are still waiting for the correspondence. Then we will go on from there, doing everything official, in the right way.\n\n'I think Fabio\u2019s impact is clear, as is the reason why we want to spend that quantity of money. We know how much he can give us because we know him perfectly. It would be perfect for us.\n\nStruggled: The Italian has never been able to establish himself as a Liverpool player since joining in 2012\n\n'I\u2019m really calm regarding Fabio and Marcos because as everyone knows, it\u2019s not about numbers or quantity, it\u2019s more about the quality of your signings. I\u2019m delighted with what we\u2019ve done so far.'\n\nSweden international Seb Larsson has welcomed the potential addition of Borini who became a cult hero on Wearside last season after notching two goals against rivals Newcastle.\n\nThe veteran midfielder, who signed a new deal in the summer despite interest from Italy, Turkey and Sweden, says the 23-year-old former Chelsea and Parma striker will be welcomed back to the North East by players and fans.\n\nLarsson said: 'It would be a really big deal for the club. Fabio was here last year and did really well, so he knows the place and we know him.\n\n'Of course that would be a great signing, but for the people behind the scenes to deal with and we\u2019ll have to see if it gets over the line.\n\n'He showed last year just what a good player he is, especially in the second half of the season. We all know what he can bring to the team, and you need as many good players as you can to help improve the competition in the squad.\n\n\n\n'If Fabio returns, it will help everyone else drive on and get better.'\n\nTimely: Borini scored four of his seven goals in Sunderland's final five games to beat the drop\n\n\n\n", "description": "Sunderland manager Gus Poyet is still confident he will land Fabio Borini in a \u00a314million deal, despite the striker boarding the flight to Liverpool's tour to the States.", "authors": ["Colin Young For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/07/18/article-2697819-1F91160600000578-831_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2014-07-20"}
