(These superfans already have.)", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nBrown bear 435 Holly's remarkable summer expansion has made her a strong contender in Katmai National Park's annual Fat Bear Week contest. (N. Boak/NPS; L. Carter/NPS)\n\nBrown bear 856 is an aggressive male suspected of being the father of bear 503, who as a cub was abandoned by his mother, bear 402, and then adopted by bear 435 Holly, who these days is so rotund that she appears to have multiple chins.\n\nMost of those same bears are now rivals in a heated battle \u2014 over pudge, not power.\n\nIt is something like a soap opera, though one with a very short season. Over just a few warm months, its floofy cast appears after a long winter\u2019s sleep and descends on Brooks Falls in Alaska\u2019s Katmai National Park. There, the players scuffle for dominance, rear cubs, sometimes share spoils, and \u2014 most important \u2014 grow comically, almost absurdly fat on the world\u2019s largest sockeye salmon run.\n\nThe bears become so mammoth that the park for five years has run an annual contest to name the most blubbery bear of all. Fat Bear Week, which began Wednesday, has a March Madness-style bracket and voting on Facebook, where the park provides before-and-after shots and a gushing stream of fat puns. The bears can gain two pounds of fat a day funneling fish ahead of hibernation, resulting in jaw-dropping physical transformations.\n\nBut Fat Bear Week is only the gimmicky finale of a summertime reality show watched obsessively by a swelling stable of fans around the world. Explore.org, a philanthropic multimedia organization, live-streams a \u201cbear cam\u201d from several spots along the Brooks River. When it launched in 2012, it had about 20,000 unique sessions a day (that is, the number of times someone started watching it); now it has about 80,000, making it the most popular of explore.org\u2019s various webcams, said Courtney Johnson, the group\u2019s social media director.\n\nThere is no shortage of live animal cams, but few offer the same breadth of characters. The park says dozens of bears, which aren\u2019t typically social animals, regularly fish the falls. But because the park is remote and expensive to visit, few people see them in person. Bear cam watchers say the footage provides a mesmerizing view of bears as individuals that must employ varying strategies to navigate a crowd and win the resources they need to survive.\n\n\u201cThe huge part at Brooks Falls is socializing \u2014 figuring out how they fit into this society, and how not to step on toes and how to behave,\u201d said Marsha Chez, a regular bear cam watcher from Aurora, Ore., who writes a tabloid-like newsletter on the bears\u2019 antics. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of social grace. They have really learned where they fit in.\u201d\n\nUrsine conflicts do occur, which participants in the cam\u2019s very animated chat room discuss as though they were scenes from \u201cDownton Abbey.\u201d The chat has spawned meetup groups and even romances between regulars, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cSome people get really emotionally invested in one bear succeeding,\u201d said Cat Yurkovich, who always has the bear cam running on one of the two computer monitors she uses for her administrative job at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville. \u201cSome keep Excel spreadsheets on when certain bears return and when they\u2019re last seen. People get really into data.\u201d\n\nYurkovich is more interested in the bears\u2019 fishing tactics and the science of it all \u2014 a topic she called \u201cnot extremely popular\u201d in the chat, which she helps moderate.\n\n\n\nCat Yurkovich, right, with a seasonal ranger at Brooks Falls in Katmai National Park, which she has visited twice. Yurkovich labeled some of the bears in the background, including 480 Otis, who has been ousted in this year's Fat Bear Week contest. (Courtesy of Cat Yurkovich)\n\nPassions sometimes run high. This summer, she said, \u201cthere was a lot of vitriol\u201d in the chat about park visitors getting too close to bears; other chatters despise bear 856 \u2014 who has been implicated in the death of a cub \u2014 and want him removed from the scene.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I kind of have to step in and say, \u2018This is the science behind it and this is why he\u2019s doing what he\u2019s doing, and it\u2019s why he\u2019s the dominant bear,\u2019 \u201d Yurkovich said. \u201cHe\u2019s not a bad bear.\u201d\n\nBut regulars say usually things stay civil, even lovely. Chez, an artist, said she misses the bear cam terribly when it\u2019s off for hibernation. Once it revs up in June, it\u2019s always on at her home office, and she starts churning out her \u201cBrooks River Tattle-er,\u201d an online publication she described as \u201cgossip from the bears\u2019 point of view.\u201d\n\nChez and about 10 other bear cam aficionados have met twice in the Portland area over beers, burgers and bear talk. \u201cIt\u2019s just \u2014 we\u2019ve fallen in love,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bizarre thing. I don\u2019t understand it. I never thought I\u2019d be watching bears. Ever, ever, ever. But now I can\u2019t take my eyes off them.\u201d\n\n\n\nA poster made by Marsha Chez, a regular viewer of the Brooks Falls bear cam, made to promote 747, her pick in this year's Fat Bear Week contest. (Marsha Chez)\n\nAlthough she is a full-time devotee, Chez said she finds Fat Bear Week thrilling. So do others: Fans make digital \u201cposters\u201d for their favorite fatsos, \u201cthe same way you would in an election in high school,\u201d she said. Because she is editor of the unofficial bear publication, Chez produces posters for all candidates. But she does not hesitate to say that she\u2019s rooting for bear 747, an animal she said \u201cgets along with almost everybody\u201d and is \u201chumongous.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy bears usually don\u2019t win,\u201d she said. \u201cThis year I think I\u2019m going for a sure thing.\u201d\n\nMike Fitz, a former Katmai park ranger who is now an Explore.org naturalist, has also endorsed 747 (whose number, the park insists, was randomly assigned, despite his similarity to a jumbo jet).\n\n\u201cYour Fat Bear Week vote can be based on any number of factors,\u201d Fitz wrote on his website. But 747, he said, is \u201ca bear who is both the fattest and the largest, two traits that are not mutually exclusive.\u201d\n\n\n\nBrown bear 747, who dines on sockeye salmon at Brooks Falls in Katmai National Park, is a favorite in the park's annual Fat Bear Week. These photos show him in early summer, left, and after two months of salmon snacks, right. (N. Boak/NPS)\n\nThe contest is wide open this year. Two-time winner 480 Otis, an aging, even-tempered bear with a floppy right ear and missing teeth, was ousted Wednesday. 409 Beadnose, a sow who took gold last year and in 2015, has not been seen this year, fueling fears that she did not survive the winter. (Chez said she is holding out hope that Beadnose had cubs and is finding her groceries in a less male-heavy spot this year.)\n\nYurkovich\u2019s favorite bear is 503, a contestant she said is \u201cjust so goofy,\u201d and prone to attention gaps that allow other bears to steal his salmon. But her pick for the contest is 435 Holly, who is known for her smarts and for depositing her cubs in a tree at a nearby campsite so she can nap.\n\nHolly is also known for \u2014 there is no delicate way to say this \u2014 her big butt.\n\n\u201cPeople like her because her fur coalesces with her fat,\u201d on her rear, where a darker stripe runs down the center, Yurkovich said. \u201cIt looks like she\u2019s wearing a thong.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\n2018: America\u2019s fattest bear has now been crowned\n\nBear breaks into house, plays the piano but not very well\n\nThe true story of two fatal grizzly bear attacks that changed our relationship with wildlife", "description": "Fat Bear Week is the finale of a wild reality show watched obsessively by a swelling stable of fans around the world.", "authors": ["Karin Brulliard", "Reporter", "Editor For Animalia", "October At Pm", "Karin Brulliard Is A National Reporter Who Writes About Animals.
