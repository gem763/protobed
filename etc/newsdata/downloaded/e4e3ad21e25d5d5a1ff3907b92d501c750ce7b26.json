Perhaps not.\n\nBoris Johnson merely expressed 'regret' to the Queen following his Supreme Court humiliation (pictured at Buckingham Palace when the Queen invited him to become Prime Minister)\n\nMr and Mrs Hunt tell a story of a Palace garden party when he was in charge of the NHS, and his Chinese wife Lucia was introduced to the notoriously gaffe-prone Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nWhen she said she was married to the Health Secretary, Prince Philip asked \u2018of which country?\u2019, according to their retelling of the encounter.\n\nLast night, Buckingham Palace declined to comment and a source close to Mrs Hunt denied the incident took place.\n\nMr and Mrs Hunt (pictured) tell a story of a Palace garden party when he was in charge of the NHS, and his Chinese wife Lucia was introduced to the Duke of Edinburgh. When she said she was married to the Health Secretary, Prince Philip allegedly asked \u2018of which country?\u2019\n\nHowever senior Tory sources says the tale has been recounted on multiple occasions.\n\nIt would not be the first time Philip has cut up rough with Hunt \u2013 whom Lucia affectionately calls \u2018Big Rice\u2019. The Duke brusquely claimed he had never heard of the politician when they were introduced in a similar line-up in 2012 \u2013 despite him having been in the Cabinet for two years.\n\nDom disarms the Spartans!\n\nBefore joining No 10, enforcer Dominic Cummings described the hardcore European Research Group of Brexiteer Tory MPs a \u2018narcissist-delusional subset\u2019 that \u2018spouts gibberish\u2019 and \u2018should be treated like a metastasising tumour and excised from the UK body politic\u2019. So it was a surprise to see him deep in conversation with leading ERG rabble-rouser Mark Francois in the wee hours of Wednesday in the conference bar.\n\nDominic Cummings described the hardcore European Research Group of Brexiteer Tory MPs a \u2018narcissist-delusional subset\u2019 before joining No.10 but has recently been spotted in conversation with the group's Mark Francois\n\nDominic Cummings (left) in deep conversation with Mark Francois at the Midland Hotel in Manchester\n\nAnd the tete-a-tete, pictured above, seems to have worked. Despite Francois always claiming that dozens of the so-called \u2018Spartan\u2019 group would vote down any deal Boris Johnson cut with Brussels if it was too similar to Theresa May\u2019s, by Wednesday afternoon he was on TV signalling his support.\n\nHapless ex-Cabinet Minister Chris Grayling is no less calamitous now he has been liberated from the pressures of Government. The clumsy Tory was spotted apologising profusely after spilling a plate of chicken, rice and pitta bread down himself at a reception for Arab ambassadors on Tuesday.\n\nTory bigwig John Hayes may be descended from trade union stock but he is a little grander than his forefathers these days. Arriving at a conference dinner on Sunday evening, the former Minister imperiously surveyed the table. Spotting his name place that simply said \u2018John Hayes MP\u2019 the Knight of the shire immediately extracted an expensive fountain pen from his well-cut suit, correcting the card to read Rt Hon Sir John Hayes MP, CBE.\n\nWhich BBC household name risks a major row with Downing Street after telling anyone who would listen at the Tory conference that Cummings was at death\u2019s door? The PM\u2019s top adviser delayed an operation to join No 10, leading to an entirely untrue wild conspiracy theory that was solemnly spread around the get-together by the very famous on-screen talent as the white wine flowed.\n\nWild goose chase drives Paul loco...\n\nTransport Secretary Paul Maynard spent most of the Conservative Party conference studying the West Coast Main Line\n\nIt's often said the Government is out of touch with the realities of Britain\u2019s creaking rail infrastructure, but Transport Minister Paul Maynard spent most of the Conservative Party conference studying the West Coast Main Line.\n\nThe junior Under-Secretary drew the short straw to return to Westminster on Monday morning to answer an Urgent Question in the Commons put down by Labour, despite having only arrived at the Manchester gathering the previous day.\n\nPulling into Euston he was promptly told the Speaker had ruled the Opposition stunt out of order, leaving Maynard to immediately head back north to complete his five-hour, 326-mile round trip at a cost of at least \u00a3350 to the taxpayer.\n\nAvoiding tax can be added to the growing rap sheet for tedious climate change protesters Extinction Rebellion. Their abortive attempt to douse the Treasury in red paint from an old fire engine backfired spectacularly last week when they lost control of the hose and ended up spraying themselves. Now DVLA records show the vehicle they used for the unintentionally hilarious stunt had no road tax. And given that no recent MoT results have been registered, the diesel wagon\u2019s emissions records conveniently remain hidden.", "description": "HARRY COLE: Prince Philip allegedly asked 'of which country?' when he was introduced to Jeremy Hunt's Chinese wife Lucia.
