I don't care about that, this needs to come out.\n\n\"I've had the same thoughts and the same sentiments since high school and every time, it was not the time or the place, and here now at the Polaris 2019, it is the time and the place for 13th Floor to take the stage. I'm so, so grateful.\"\n\nLast year's Polaris Music Prize winner, Jeremy Dutcher, was in attendance tonight, as he states, to \"give over the crown\" to Mighty. Dutcher delivered a moving speech of his own prior to the winner reveal.\n\n\"I think what tonight is about is togetherness and all of you who share this stage so beautifully exemplified how important it is to come together right now and do it in music, and do it in art,\" Dutcher told this year's nominees, after getting all of them to stand up. \"It's so important that our stories are coming forward and that we're challenging these narratives of separateness.\"\n\nDutcher then took aim at the People's Party of Canada, an \"anti-immigration\" party that was given a televised debate spot recently. \"You do not come to this country and tell us when it's closed,\" Dutcher said. \"Enough. We always welcome in this land, that's how we do it, that's how the matriarchs do it.\"", "description": "The Toronto rapper is the first hip hop artist to win the $50,000 grand prize.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5286246.1568690036!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/haviah-mighty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
