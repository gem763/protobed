They were first delivered in 1997.\n\nBoeing is replacing the NG with the 737 Max, but the Max remains grounded worldwide after two crashes killed 346 people, although it is unaffected by the cracking issues.\n\nMore than 1,700 planes must be checked before they fly another 1,000 times.\n\nAmerican, United and Delta said none of their Boeing 737s needed to be checked within seven days but they have some that will need inspections over the next few months.\n\nGol, which runs a fleet of 115, excluding its grounded Max jets, said 3 per cent of passengers would be affected by the groundings until mid-December.\n\nSouthwest said it had completed all inspections in compliance with the seven-day deadline and had reported the findings on its two planes affected to Boeing and the FAA.\n\n\u201cThe aircraft will remain out of our schedule until the issues have been fully resolved,\u201d the company said. \u201cSafety is always our uncompromising priority, and our technical operations team is now focused on completing inspections of the remaining portion of the 737 NG fleet covered by the Airworthiness Directive.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies\n\nRead more\n\nBoeing 737 Max: \u2018Pilots led their passengers over an aerodynamic edge\u2019\n\nBoeing 737 Max: the people whose views are safety-critical\n\nBoeing 737 Max: What needs to happen for it to fly again?\n\nBoeing 737 Max: the questions the world wants answered", "description": "An American airline has grounded two Boeing jets after finding cracks in parts that connect the wings to the fuselage.A Brazilian airline has also grounded 11 Boeing 737s after finding evidence of \u201cthe need to replace a specific component\u201d.", "authors": ["Jane Dalton"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6ryh_R.7oT7vT15bKEmeUA--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/8cfa3a94b860acdf7fbb19b9de7aa496", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
