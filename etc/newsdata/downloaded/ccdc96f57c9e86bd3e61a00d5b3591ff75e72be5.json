Brown was booked on the Amsterdam-bound flight, according to the airport.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnother flight, this one bound for Dublin, was delayed about two hours when, while the plane was at the end of the runway, a protester began to walk down the aisle while discussing climate change. The crew alerted the pilot when the protester refused to sit down, after which police escorted him off the plane, according to the BBC.\n\nThe protests have been minimally disruptive to airport operations thus far, according to the BBC. The airport said as of Thursday afternoon, more than 100 flights had arrived or departed.\n\n\"We continue to work closely with the Metropolitan Police to ensure the safe operation of the airport, which remains fully open and operational,\u201d a spokesperson told the BBC.\n\nActivists have said they aim for a \u201cHong Kong-style occupation of the terminal building\" amid the airport\u2019s planned expansion, which they say is incompatible with government plans to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. John Curran, a former Metropolitan Police detective, was among the 49 arrested at the airport.", "description": "London\u2019s Metropolitan Police arrested nearly 850 people\u00a0related to climate change protests around the city over the past four days, including a former Paralympic cyclist who climbed atop a British Airways plane at London City Airport,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/airplane_passenger_jet.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
