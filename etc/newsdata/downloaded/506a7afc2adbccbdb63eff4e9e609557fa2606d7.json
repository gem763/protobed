The takedown came only a few hours after he\u2019d announced that he and Paige Cole, another contestant from AYTO, were dating, despite not having been each other\u2019s Perfect Matches on the MTV dating show. The couple broke the news to their respective Instagram followers with similar posts including a selfie showing the two licking either side of a dildo hanging on a wall behind them, which is still viewable on Twitter. As far as Duran could tell, that post was the cause of his account takedown.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so pissed,\u201d Duran tells me over the phone. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh, shit, my picture got taken down,\u2019 but my whole account got deleted without warning. I didn\u2019t get an email. Nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see so many things on Instagram that are a lot more adult than a dick on the wall,\u201d Cole adds in a separate phone call. \u201cYou see car accidents where people probably died, you see photos of animal abuse on popular pages. There are real issues on Instagram, but they have a problem with sex workers. They have a problem with a titty popping out. They have a problem with a gay man and his gay girlfriend posing with a dick on the wall. We say \u2018Homophobia!\u2019 jokingly, but there\u2019s no excuse for deleting his account and not mine for literally posting the same content.\u201d\n\nFor Duran, the loss isn\u2019t just personal: The fashion designer-turned-party promoter the @remdelarem Instagram account he\u2019s been using since 2014 has been instrumental in helping him build a platform, promote parties, and sell merch, providing him with a stable source of income to support both himself and his mother. The loss hits especially hard right now in the wake of the AYTO finale, when public interest in the show\u2019s cast members has never been and will likely never be higher.\n\n\u201cInstagram is the biggest platform I have to promote my work,\u201d Duran says of the account where he was planning to promote his own products and merchandise. The account had more than 49k followers at the time of its takedown and was gaining about 100 new followers every 20 minutes on Tuesday.\n\nWhile Duran\u2019s account was taken down, Cole merely had her post taken down, an inconsistency that confused and annoyed them both. \u201cI\u2019m sick for him,\u201d Cole tells me. \u201cBeing on the show has enabled me to be contacted by brands for influencer gigs. I\u2019m hoping to use it to build my modeling career in the entertainment industry because people watching you is worth more than currency. Get the right person watching you, and your whole life can change. We know all the right people are watching us within 24 hours [of AYTO\u2019s season finale], and they can\u2019t even look at Remy.\u201d\n\nInstagram\u2019s Community Guidelines explicitly prohibit things like \u201csexual intercourse,\u201d \u201cgenitals,\u201d and \u201csome photos of female nipples.\u201d Accounts that violate those guidelines can apparently be \u201cdisabled without warning,\u201d though it\u2019s unclear why Duran\u2019s account would be disabled but Cole\u2019s would be left standing after violating the same thing. During our conversation, Duran noted that Instagram had previously taken down two of his Instagram posts for violating the platform\u2019s adult content policies, so perhaps his record played a role in the account takedown. I\u2019ve reached out to Instagram for clarification as to why Duran\u2019s account was deleted and why Cole\u2019s posts were taken down. No representative for the platform has responded, but I will update this story if they do.\n\nFor their part, Duran and Cole blame Instagram\u2019s adult content policies, which they find homophobic, misogynistic, and needlessly harmful to sex workers.\n\n\u201cInstagram\u2019s rules are ridiculous,\u201d says Duran. \u201cThey punish sex workers\u2014anybody in any sort of sex industry unfairly.\u201d\n\nInstagram has a history of shadowbanning and deleting sex workers\u2019 accounts, using the same adult content policies that Duran and Cole appear to have violated as justification for doing so.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re on some extra hater shit,\u201d he adds.\n\nFollow Harron Walker on Twitter.", "description": "'Are You The One?' star Remy Duran appears to have lost his account for posing with a piece of plastic and his newly minted partner from the reality show.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d78427acf58fe00081ed162/lede/1568162481504-Remy-Duran.jpeg?crop=0.8485xw:0.318xh;0xw,0.1287xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
