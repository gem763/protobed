In 1960 the 400 richest families paid as much as 56% in taxes, by 1980 the rate had fallen to 40%. But Trump\u2019s tax cuts \u2013 his most significant legislative victory \u2013 proved a tipping point.\n\nThanks to the controversial tax package the top 0.1% of US households were granted a 2.5% tax cut that pushed their rate below that of the lower 50% of US earners.\n\n\u201cThis is a revolutionary change and the biggest winners will be the everyday American workers as jobs start pouring into our country, as companies start competing for American labor, and as wages start going up at levels that you haven\u2019t seen in many years,\u201d Trump said in September 2017 as he fought to pass the tax package.\n\nBut the tax cuts have not led to a significant uptick in economic growth, hiring has slowed and wage growth has remained lackluster. In the meantime the national deficit has swollen to $1tn.\n\nThe calculations of Saez and Zucman, who have previously worked with the French economist Thomas Piketty, take into account not just federal income taxes but also state, local and corporate taxes.\n\nThe pair argue that the dramatic fall in taxes for the ultra wealthy is the result of policies enacted by both Republican and Democratic administrations which have both cut top rates and taxes on capital gains while allowing corporations to shelter their profits overseas.", "description": "Economists calculate richest 400 families in US paid an average tax rate of 23% while the bottom half of households paid a rate of 24.2%", "authors": ["Dominic Rushe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7220a22121f5622afd201636c6c4cf3ed3151e3c/0_97_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e9c335b550f838dccaef167f7300842a", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
