Khan's two-day visit ran from September 19 to 20.\n\nThe crown prince told Khan \"I want to avoid war\", the senior Pakistani official told the Times. Afterwards, Khan spoke to Iran's President Hassan Rouhani at the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).\n\nWhen Iraq's Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi visited Jeddah on September 25, MBS made the same request, according to a senior Iraqi official who spoke to the Times on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe official said Iraq had suggested its capital, Baghdad, as the venue for a potential meeting between Saudi and Iranian leaders.\n\nSaudi Arabia and Iran have taken opposing sides on various conflicts in the Middle East, including the wars in Yemen and Syria. Riyadh has also backed Trump's \"maximum pressure\" campaign against Iran, in which the US leader imposed punishing sanctions against Tehran after Washington abandoned a landmark deal that curbed Tehran's nuclear programme.\n\nAnalysts told the Times that any reconciliation between the two regional powers would have far-reaching consequences, particularly on Trump's efforts to isolate Iran.\n\nRouhani turned down a meeting with Trump at the UNGA, ruling out any talks between the two countries until Washington lifted its sanctions. He also invited regional countries to join a \"coalition for hope\", which he said would pledge non-aggression and non-interference in one another's affairs.\n\nAbdul Mahdi told Al Jazeera last week that he believes Saudi Arabia is looking to de-escalate tensions with its arch foe.\n\n\"Nobody possesses the weapons necessary to deal their adversary a fatal blow. Chaos and destruction will hit the region in its entirety,\" he said.\n\n\"Everybody is open to dialogue,\" the Iraqi prime minister said. \"Iran says [it is] willing to negotiate if sanctions are lifted; the US [also] asks for dialogue ... neither does Saudi Arabia close the door for dialogue.\"\n\n\"There are many countries, and Iraq is one of them, that can offer a solution or a place for a solution to be found.\"", "description": "New York Times says Saudi crown prince asked leaders of Iraq and Pakistan to speak to Iran about defusing tensions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/5/18d56b0c6f9c4826a66e66ee84641cc6_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
