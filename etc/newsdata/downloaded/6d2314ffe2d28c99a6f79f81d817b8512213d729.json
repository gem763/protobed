Democrats \u2013 and an anonymous whistleblower complaint \u2013 claim that Trump used military aid to pressure Zelensky to assist an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nDemocrats so far have called former U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, former U.S. envoy to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, and President Trump\u2019s former top Russia adviser Fiona Hill.\n\nVolker was spotted back on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, and U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland is scheduled for testimony Thursday.\n\nIn her announcement that she does not intend to call a vote, Pelosi defended her decision, pointing to how the Constitution does not specify how the House must carry out impeachment investigations.\n\n\u201cThere's no requirement that we have a vote, and so at this time we will not be having a vote,\" Pelosi said.\n\nPelosi\u2019s approach, however, does not find support in precedent. The impeachment investigations of Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton were both initiated after the full House of Representatives voted to approve them.\n\nIn the past, Turley noted, \u201cHouse members felt a responsibility to vote on whether to start the process. Most importantly, it gives clarity to a federal court in balancing congressional demands against executive privilege.\u201d\n\nExecutive privilege was one of the protections mentioned by Counsel to the Vice President Matthew Morgan in a Tuesday letter to the chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight Committees, who are overseeing the ongoing inquiry. Morgan\u2019s letter claimed that the committees\u2019 request for documents was overbroad because it included some documents that were \u201cclearly not vice-presidential records,\u201d and that the request was not within the realm of \u201clegitimate legislative oversight.\u201d\n\nMorgan also pointed to the Democratic majority\u2019s unorthodox methods in carrying out their investigation.\n\nGOP CHALLENGER FILES ETHICS COMPLAINT AGAINST SCHIFF FOR PURPORTING TO OBTAIN COMPROMISING TRUMP PICTURES\n\n\u201cNever before in history has the Speaker of the House attempted to launch an \u2018impeachment inquiry\u2019 against a President without a majority of the House of Representatives voting to authorize a constitutionally acceptable process,\u201d Morgan wrote, noting that \u201cHouse rules do not delegate to any committee the authority to conduct an inquiry under the impeachment power of Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThis echoed an Oct. 8 letter to Pelosi and the committee chairs from White House counsel Pat Cipollone.\n\n\u201cGiven that your inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections, the Executive Branch cannot be expected to participate in it,\u201d Cipollone said.\n\nTrump himself criticized Pelosi Wednesday while speaking to reporters.\n\n\"She's done this country a great disservice,\" Trump said, adding it was an \"open and shut case\" about his conversation with Zelensky, which he described as \"absolutely perfect.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s attorney Rudy Giuliani is also refusing to cooperate with Democrats. A letter to the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation counsel from attorney Jon Sale said Giuliani \u201cwill not participate because this appears to be an unconstitutional, baseless, and illegitimate \u2018impeachment inquiry.\u2019\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans have also cried foul, stating that the proceedings, led by House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff, D-Calif., do not allow Republican lawmakers to issue subpoenas of their own. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Callif., called the ongoing investigation \u201ca total sham,\u201d citing a lack of due process, and House Judiciary Committee ranking member Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., accused Pelosi and Schiff of keeping \u201cthe truth and their unfair tactics hidden from public scrutiny.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSchiff, meanwhile, insists that his investigation has revealed presidential wrongdoing, despite the Trump administration\u2019s lack of cooperation.\n\n\u201cThe Office of Management and Budget, State Department and the DOD have failed to comply with Congressional subpoenas,\u201d Schiff tweeted Wednesday. \u201cDespite this unprecedented obstruction, we\u2019ve uncovered significant evidence of Trump\u2019s abuse of power. And we\u2019ll continue to expose the truth.\u201d", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement that she has no plans to hold a vote to formally approve an impeachment inquiry of President Trump has been met with concerns from Republicans and the White House that the ongoing probe lacks legal authority.", "authors": ["Ronn Blitzer"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/13f2d382-trump-pelosi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
