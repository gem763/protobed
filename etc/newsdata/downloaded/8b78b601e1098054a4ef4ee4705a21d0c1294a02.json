Yes, global warming is real and human-caused, but her vision of climate change as the end of the world is unsupported. The UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that by the 2070s, the total effects of climate change, including on ecosystems, will be equivalent to a reduction in average income of 0.2 to 2 per cent. By then, each person on the planet will be 300 to 500 per-cent richer.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWe don\u2019t emit CO2 with malign intent. Indeed, it is a byproduct of giving humanity access to unprecedented amounts of energy.\n\nJust a century ago, life was back-breaking. Plentiful energy made better lives possible, without having to spend hours collecting firewood, polluting your household with smoke, achieving heat, cold, transportation, light, food and opportunities. Life expectancy doubled. Plentiful energy, mostly from fossil fuels, has lifted more than a billion people out of poverty in just the past 25 years.\n\nThat is not evil \u2013 it is quite the opposite.\n\nMs. Thunberg believes that climate change means people are dying, but the fact is that weather-related disasters just a century ago killed half a million people each year. Today, despite rising temperatures but because of less poverty and more resilience, droughts, floods, hurricanes and extreme temperatures kill just 20,000 people each year \u2013 a reduction of 95 per cent. That is a morally commendable achievement.\n\nEnding global fossil-fuel use by 2028 is a flawed plan because green energy is simply not in a place in its development where it can take over what fossil fuels leave behind. A hard by-hook-or-crook transition would cause a real, global catastrophe, sending most of us back into back-breaking poverty. That\u2019s why developing countries, especially, want more fossil-fuel power, not less; they want to lift more people into comfortable lives.\n\nWhat we need is low-CO\u2082 energy that can outcompete fossil fuels \u2013 which would make everyone, including China and India, switch. This means dramatically increasing global investment into green research and development, something that we have conspicuously failed to do these past decades, exactly because activists have consistently demanded solutions before they are ready.\n\nFinally, Ms. Thunberg tells us that if we don\u2019t cut off fossil fuels by 2028, the young generation will never forgive us. This, however, is reflective of a blinkered first-world view. When the United Nations asked 10 million people around the world what they prioritize, they highlighted five issues: health, education, jobs, corruption and nutrition. In sum, they care about their kids not dying from easily curable diseases, getting a decent education, not starving to death.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nClimate came last of 16 choices. That\u2019s not because it is unimportant, but because for most of humanity, other issues are much more pressing.\n\nThe problem is that climate is increasingly trumping all other issues. A third of all development aid, for instance, is now spent addressing climate, in direct defiance of the priorities of the world\u2019s poor.\n\nWhile we should address climate through higher investments in green-energy R&D, it seems truer to say that most of the world\u2019s young will never forgive us if we prioritized climate above our duty to tackle poverty, health, education and nutrition.\n\nKeep your Opinions sharp and informed.
