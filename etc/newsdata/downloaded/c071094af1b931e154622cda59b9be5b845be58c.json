We thought we\u2019d remind the country via a 7,500 sq/m sand installation on Redcar beach that can be seen from space. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\nThe group said it installed the giant sand drawing in north-east England because it believed the region would be one that would suffer the most from a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cThe government is claiming the 2016 referendum gives it a mandate to crash us out of the EU without a deal, but that\u2019s nonsense,\u201d said Will Rose of Led By Donkeys.\n\n\u201cGove is right \u2013 nobody ever voted for a no-deal Brexit. Now the government is suspending parliament so even MPs will find it hard to have a say.\n\n\u201cWe decided to do this sand installation in Redcar because the north-east will be hit hard by a no-deal Brexit. Nobody voted to lose jobs and investment.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday morning, Gove refused on BBC One\u2019s Andrew Marr Show to confirm that the government would abide by legislation blocking a no-deal Brexit if it was forced through by Tory rebels and the opposition when the Commons sits this week.\n\nWhat Vote Leave leaders really said about no-deal Brexit Read more\n\nLed By Donkeys was formed in December 2018 by four remain supporters who initially wanted to bring the pronouncements of key Brexiters to a wider audience by turning them into Twitter posts that were pasted on to advertising hoardings.\n\nOne of their early efforts was of Johnson saying in July 2017: \u201cThere is no plan for no deal because we\u2019re going to get a great deal.\u201d\n\nThe men, who are current or former members of Greenpeace, also followed Nigel Farage\u2019s protest march on London in two vans displaying digital ads and produced an enormous banner that was unfurled at the anti-Brexit rally in March.\n\nThey take their name from the phrase used to describe British soldiers during the first world war: \u201cLions led by donkeys.\u201d", "description": "Led By Donkeys group reminds minister of his statement that no one voted for no-deal Brexit", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29c3064314093821daf00c2f6d7e576e8ee21a17/109_0_3281_1969/master/3281.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cfdc164c26114fdbd2d19c21d0963c73"}
