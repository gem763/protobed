If we don\u2019t get it right soon, that\u2019s it for us,\u201d the legendary novelist told audiences, adding that her biologist father was already sounding the climate alarm back in the 1950s.\n\nAtwood, 79, who this week co-won the prestigious Booker Prize for her sequel to the dystopian classic \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d, said she fully supported Extinction Rebellion campaigners who use peaceful disruptive action to draw attention to climate change.\n\n\u201cI have watched this unfold over the decades. I wrote a trilogy centering around the extinction of species and the climate crisis that is now upon us.\n\n\u201cSo I was very happy to see all these young people show up. Like, where have you been all my life!\u201d\n\n\u2014 Maja Lunde\u2019s sleepless nights \u2014\n\nNorwegian novelist Lunde, who is working on a quartet of climate fiction books that started with the smash hit \u201cThe History of Bees\u201d, admitted to losing sleep about the environment.\n\n\u201cI suddenly wake up and see images of the Amazon burning,\u201d she told the fair.\n\n\u201cRight now, I think a lot of us know on an objective level that the state of the world is really bad,\u201d the 44-year-old said.\n\n\u201cBut we haven\u2019t really understood with our hearts. And I think literature can be a way into our hearts,\u201d Lunde added, calling for urgent action.\n\n\u201cHomo sapiens is an amazing animal. Think of all the things we have done. Of course we can stop the climate and nature crisis if we truly want to.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ken Follett: \u2018We still love you\u2019 \u2014\n\nThe 70-year-old British author railed against his country\u2019s decision to leave the EU and the lost opportunities it presented for the nation\u2019s young people.\n\n\u201cI am embarrassed because my country is saying to our European neighbours: we don\u2019t want to be part of your club, we don\u2019t like you, and a lot of them are saying \u2018we\u2019re better than you\u2019.\n\n\u201cI want to say: No, no, no.\u201d\n\nFollett, whose global bestsellers include \u201cEye of the Needle\u201d and \u201cThe Pillars of the Earth\u201d, said he would embark on a \u201cFriendship Tour\u201d of European cities next month with fellow British novelists Lee Child, Kate Mosse and Jojo Moyes.\n\n\u201cWe are just going to make this little tour just to say to our readers: We still love you.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Colson Whitehead on racism \u2014\n\n\u201cAmerica is very racist, has been racist since its founding and will be for all our lifetimes,\u201d said Whitehead, who won a Pulitzer Prize for \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d, a novel about black slaves escaping the American south.\n\n\u201cWe are not wriggling free from our ignorance and prejudice anytime soon,\u201d the 49-year-old added, decrying efforts in the United States to suppress the voices of minorities by closing voter precincts or through voter ID requirements.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a continuum between slavery and Jim Crow and now. There are people who are up late, mostly Republicans, who are thinking up ways to subjugate poor people and people of colour.\u201d\n\nHis latest book \u201cThe Nickel Boys\u201d, set in the 1960s, was inspired by the discovery of 55 unmarked graves at a Florida reform school for boys.\n\n\u201cIt was tough writing these books back to back. So my next one is going to be about puppies,\u201d he joked.", "description": "Frankfurt am Main (AFP) \u2013 From being \u201cembarrassed\u201d about Brexit to losing sleep over the climate crisis, here\u2019s a look at what", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/9da95a_margaret-atwood-author-handmaid-tale-its-highly-praised-sequel-testaments-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
