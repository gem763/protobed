Additionally, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said President Donald Trump had ordered a \"deliberate withdrawal\" of U.S. forces from northern Syria, an even more comprehensive withdrawal than had been previously ordered. \"I spoke with the president last night after discussions with the rest of the national security team and he directed that we begin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern Syria,\" Esper said, though he declined to provide a timeframe. The twin developments reflected growing chaos in Syria, where the Turkish offensive has raised fears it will destabilize the region, create another refugee crisis and allow the battered Islamic State group to make a comeback.\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian rebels take aim towards the border town of Ras al-Ain on Oct. 12, 2019, as Turkey and it's allies continued their assault on Kurdish-held border towns in northeastern Syria.
