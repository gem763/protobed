(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nAnother big crowd is expected to stuff Audi Field on Saturday for a Washington Spirit match, drawn by the novelty of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League team playing in the District, by the appearance of several famous players and by the rush of enthusiasm since the U.S. national team lifted the World Cup trophy in France.\n\nFor Spirit Coach Richie Burke, however, greater attention brings heightened expectations. And with time running out to qualify for the playoffs, the Spirit must do more than attract fans; it needs to send them home happy against Reign FC, the Tacoma, Wash.-based club that features U.S. superstar Megan Rapinoe returning from injury.\n\n\u201cI would like to deliver a product that matches that kind of demand and interest from a spectator perspective,\u201d Burke said. \u201cAnd if we are going to continue to pull in big crowds, we\u2019ve got to have a good product. I want it to be good.\u201d\n\n[\u2018I am in your head. The rent is free.\u2019 Meet the hardest-working mouth in MLS.]\n\nThe Spirit (7-7-4, 25 points) was good the first time it visited D.C. United\u2019s downtown venue three weeks ago, satisfying a sellout crowd of 19,871 with a 2-1 victory over the Orlando Pride.\n\nIt was the 10th-largest attendance since NWSL launched in 2013; eight of the other nine came in Portland, with Orlando\u2019s home debut in 2016 also making the list (23,403).\n\nWashington usually plays home games at Maryland SoccerPlex, a 5,200-capacity venue in upper Montgomery County with average attendance of 3,419 this season.\n\nBy early Friday, ticket sales for Saturday\u2019s match had surpassed 15,000, a Spirit spokeswoman said. Expected attendees include other Washington pro athletes and several members of the Atlanta Braves, who are planning to walk three blocks from Nationals Park after their late-afternoon game ends. (Braves shortstop Dansby Swanson is dating Spirit star Mallory Pugh.)\n\nThe Spirit hopes to parlay the support into three points, which are vital if the club is to reach the four-team playoffs. Washington is in sixth place, six out of the last playoff slot, but has played the fewest games in the nine-team league.\n\nThe North Carolina Courage (37 points), Portland Thorns (36) and Chicago Red Stars (35) are well-positioned to advance, but the Utah Royals (31) and Reign FC (30) are within striking distance. Washington has six games left, Utah and Reign five apiece.\n\nAfter Saturday, though, the Spirit is home once, against defending champion North Carolina on Sept. 28 at SoccerPlex.\n\nThe Spirit will probably have to make do again Saturday without World Cup midfielder Rose Lavelle, who has been recovering from a head injury suffered Aug. 17 in Portland.\n\nAs a contracted national team player, Lavelle cannot compete until she is cleared by the U.S. Soccer Federation. She missed the recent U.S. victory tour matches against Portugal in Philadelphia and St. Paul, Minn.\n\n\u201cRosey is going mad,\u201d Burke said. \u201cShe is like, \u2018Can\u2019t I just play?\u2019\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Rosey, I am not going to put you in harm\u2019s way. I don\u2019t care how many people are in the stadium. I don\u2019t care where we are in the playoffs. You\u2019re not playing if it\u2019s your health. I\u2019ll get killed. You\u2019re a national treasure!\u2019\n\n\u201cIf they say \u2018no,\u2019 she is not playing a minute.\u201d\n\nThe Spirit will have Pugh, who is working toward peak fitness and form after a leg injury sidelined her following the World Cup. She missed the first appearance at Audi Field but is slated to start Saturday. Burke suggested she would play 65 or 70 minutes, though she told the coach she wanted to go 80 to 90.\n\nIn the national matches against Portugal, Pugh logged 29 and 33 minutes.\n\nRapinoe is also rebounding from injury: In her first match since the World Cup last Sunday, she entered in the 72nd minute of Reign FC\u2019s 3-1 victory over visiting Orlando. She seems likely to play 30 minutes against Washington.\n\nThe Reign roster also includes U.S. national team midfielder Allie Long.\n\nThe Spirit has been dormant since its first D.C. appearance. Since then, there was a weather-related postponement in Orlando and a bye weekend.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a little mini-season,\u201d Burke said, \u201cto try to get ourselves into the playoffs.\u201d\n\nReign FC at Washington Spirit\n\nWhere: Audi Field.\n\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Saturday.\n\nTV: NBC Sports Washington.\n\nRecords: Reign: 8-5-6, 30 points; Spirit: 7-7-4, 25 points.\n\nRead more:\n\n16 U.S. soccer players find a home in Switzerland \u2014 and in the Champions League\n\nThe day before an international match, a goalie from Cura\u00e7ao died of a heart attack\n\nSoccer video game Football Manager is getting its players to rethink Brexit", "description": "Coach Richie Burke stressed the need for a win to stay in the playoff race, saying, \"If we are going to continue to pull in big crowds, we\u2019ve got to have a good product.\"", "authors": ["Steven Goff", "Reporter Covering Soccer", "D.C.
