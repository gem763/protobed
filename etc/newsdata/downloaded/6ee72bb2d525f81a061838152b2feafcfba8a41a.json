Lipoedema is a long-term chronic condition where there's an abnormal build-up of fat cells in the legs, thighs and buttocks, and sometimes in the arms. The condition usually only affects women, although in rare cases it can also affect men. It is believed to affect nearly 11 per cent of adult women worldwide. Symptoms of lipoedema In lipoedema, the thighs, buttocks, lower legs, and sometimes the arms, become enlarged due to a build-up of abnormal fat cells. Both legs and/or the arms are usually enlarged at the same time and to the same extent. The feet and hands aren't affected, which creates a 'bracelet' effect or 'band-like' appearance just above the ankles and wrists. Leg and arm size can vary between individuals with lipoedema, and the condition can gradually get worse over time. Treatment There's been little research into lipoedema, so there's some uncertainty about the best way to treat the condition. Tumescent liposuction involves sucking out the unwanted fat through a tube. It's difficult to get NHS funding for liposuction to treat lipoedema, but your GP can try to apply for funding through your local CCG. Non-surgical treatments such as compression therapy can sometimes help improve pain and tenderness. Cause The cause of lipoedema isn't known, but in some cases there's a family history of the condition. It seems likely that the gene inherited from parents play a role. Lipoedema tends to start at puberty or at other times of hormonal change, such during pregnancy or the menopause, which suggests hormones may also have an influence. Although the accumulation of fat cells is often worse in obese people, lipoedema isn't caused by obesity.\n\nThe mother, who relies on a crutch, said the longest she can walk is five minutes to her children's nursery.\n\nSupport from her six children, aged from 20 to two, has been invaluable for her mental health.\n\nShe said:'My children are such a big help. My little two-year-old will come rub my legs and she says \"mummy's legs are hurting\".'\n\nThe mother said she has still not been able to accept her condition despite the support.\n\nShe said: 'I have gone from being quite a sociable person to someone who doesn't speak to anybody\n\n'I am stuck here in my four walls with my children and that seems to be my world. I feel like I am just here for everybody else's sake.'\n\nThe only major treatment available to Ms Oldfield is a form of liposuction - something the NHS will not fund in cosmetic cases.\n\nShe said: 'I was reading a story the other day about a model who had a nose job done on the NHS.\n\n'That frustrates you because it makes you think why are they doing it for her for a cosmetic reason but they won't do it for me for a medical reason.\n\n'Everyone sees it as a cosmetic thing rather than something that has ruined my life.\n\n'It's not cosmetic to me. I don't want to look like a supermodel; I just want to look a little bit more normal and lead a normal life.\n\n'I have been in tears everyday.'\n\nMs Oldfield is now raising money for up to three 'life-changing' surgeries which she believes may cost \u00a33,000 each.\n\nShe asks her local clinic about the possibility of liposuction every six months but has so far been unsuccessful.\n\nLipoedema UK chairwoman Sharie Fetzer said: 'Lipoedema has a cruel impact on women's lives - from restricting career choices to causing daily pain and mobility problems.\n\n'Lack of treatments and awareness from the medical profession leads to despair. Lives can be ruined. Much, much more must be done to ensure a quicker diagnosis and help women combat lipoedema.\n\n'All women with lipoedema deserve the brighter, normal future, that others take for granted.'", "description": "Claire Oldfield, 36, from Huddersfield, suffers from lipoedema which produces an abnormally high amount of fat cells in her thighs, calves and buttocks.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/12/19688910-0-image-a-33_1571050865502.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
