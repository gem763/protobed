But The Tuscaloosa News quoted spokesman Brad Fisher as saying the hospital system paid the attackers.\n\n\"For ongoing security reasons, we will be keeping confidential specific details about the investigation and our coordination with the attacker,\" Fisher told the newspaper.\n\nThe company stopped accepting new patients at its hospitals in Tuscaloosa, Northport and Fayette because of a ransomware attack that hit early Tuesday. New patients were sent to hospitals in Birmingham and Mississippi.\n\nHospitals will continue diverting all but the most critically ill patients through the weekend, the statement said.\n\nThe hospitals said hackers used the ransomware variant Ryuk to lock its files, but the hack didn't compromise the care of patients. Workers reverted to using paper files.\n\nThe three hospitals, which mostly serve west Alabama, have about 850 beds total and admitted more than 32,000 patients last year.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
