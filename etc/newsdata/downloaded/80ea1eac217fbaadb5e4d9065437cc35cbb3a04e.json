Having an $84 million quarterback does not appear to be worth the paper his contract is printed on\u2014yeah, that isn\u2019t good. Having a star player be openly critical of the team\u2019s offense\u2014also not great. But what really isn\u2019t good are rumors that one of their most important offensive weapons, wide receiver Stefon Diggs, wants out of town.\n\nVikings Star Wideout Stirs the Rumor Mill\n\nDiggs hasn\u2019t torn a page from Antonio Brown\u2019s playbook or taken any cues from Jalen Ramsey. However, if you believe the rumors, he\u2019s growing disenchanted with the team and its \u201cweak sauce\u201d quarterback. While the offensive struggles this season are part of the issue, he also feels like the team may not care what he thinks \u2013 or if he is even on the team.\n\nIt kind of sounds like Jalen Ramsey\u2019s \u201clack of respect\u201d beef with the Jaguars.\n\nOf course, the rumors become fueled even more when he starts to follow players from other teams on Twitter. It doesn\u2019t help that he missed practice Wednesday for a non-injury related reason. Not talking to the media the last two weeks doesn\u2019t help, either.\n\nThen on Thursday he did talk to the media, but what he said certainly didn\u2019t make it sound like he wants to play out his career \u2013 or even the 2019 season \u2013 in Minneapolis:\n\n\u201cBut there is truth to all rumors, I guess,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also stated that he had not requested a trade and that the only discussions he has had were related to the team playing better. But when asked if his agent had communicated anything, he told reporters, \u201cyou got to talk to him.\u201d\n\nTop Trade Destinations for Stefon Diggs\n\nThe Vikings have claimed that they will not be trading him, but they could be saying that in hopes teams will up their offers. The fact that he just signed a five-year, $72 million deal with $40 million guaranteed will limit the market.\n\nOne team did contact the Vikings, but they were reportedly told that Stefon Diggs is not going anywhere.\n\nIf they were to trade him, speculation has centered around the New England Patriots, Seattle Seahawks, Indianapolis Colts, and Buffalo Bills. So who is it going to be?\n\nDon\u2019t count on the Seahawks taking him. Yes, they could use a guy like Diggs. But it is more likely they try to improve their current unit.\n\nBuffalo could use him, but their offense seems more run-oriented, which would make a $14 million receiver unnecessary.\n\nIndianapolis remains an intriguing possibility. TY Hilton is the only good receiver they have, but his health is questionable. If the Colts are going to make a run at the AFC South and the playoffs this season, they need to make a deal. However, making this trade doesn\u2019t sound like something Colts GM Chris Ballard would do.\n\nBut if anyone is going to make it happen, it will be the Patriots and their rag-tag collection of receivers. They already appear primed to make a Super Bowl run, and giving Tom Brady a weapon like Stefon Diggs would be the icing on the cake.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stefon-diggs-trade-rumors-afp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
