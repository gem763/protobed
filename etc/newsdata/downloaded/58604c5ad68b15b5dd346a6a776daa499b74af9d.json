Against a basket of currencies the dollar fell 0.1% to 99.012.\n\nThe moves offered a preview of what to expect if the talks achieve little or nothing, said Joe Capurso, senior currency strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.\n\n\"We don't see any easy route to an agreement so we can see this going on for quite some time,\" he said.\n\nMarkets have for weeks gyrated as the likelihood of a breakthrough at the talks has waxed and waned while signs of the toll that the U.S.-China trade dispute is taking on the global economy have growth in strength and number.\n\nOptimism that some sort of partial agreement between the parties could be reached had rallied risk assets overnight, before the SCMP report quickly unwound most of the hopes.\n\n\"The markets still seem to be travelling with a glimmer of optimism,\" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank, with one possibility a deal that staves off U.S. tariff rises in return for agricultural purchases by China.\n\n\"But as things stand that looks like a little bit naively optimistic that that was going to be the result of this. We're back to saying that chances are no trade deal.\"\n\nTensions had flared leading in to the deputy-level discussions after U.S. imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials and blacklisted some Chinese tech firms it believes are implicated in the poor treatment of Muslim minorities.\n\nSurprised and upset by the blacklisting, China lowered expectations for progress from the talks, Chinese government officials told Reuters.\n\nThe SCMP report cited a source saying the talks had so far skirted some of the thorniest issues, including technology transfers and state subsidies in China.\n\nLiu, who is scheduled to meet U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin later on Thursday, no longer plans to remain in the U.S. capital for meetings on Friday, the paper said.\n\nThe Chinese yuan fell as far as 7.1677 per dollar, its weakest since Sept. 4, before recovering in offshore trade.\n\nThe Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar each fell 0.1% to touch one-week lows, but then steadied with the Aussie last buying $0.6717 and the kiwi $0.6287.\n\nThe pound was flat after a roller coaster overnight session where it leapt on reports of a breakthrough on the Irish backstop and then gave up the gains as hopes of progress on a key sticking point for a Brexit deal were dashed.\n\nIt steadied at $1.2214 per pound, not far above a one-month low.", "description": "The yen rose and the yuan fell on Thursday, after a news report said deputy-level trade talks between Chinese and U.S. officials in Washington had failed to make much headway, sending investors scurrying for safety.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106067265-1565225441311gettyimages-539721976.jpeg?v=1570668271", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
